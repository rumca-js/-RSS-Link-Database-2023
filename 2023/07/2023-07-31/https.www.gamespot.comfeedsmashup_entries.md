## Venba Review - Tourist To Your Own Culture

<p dir="ltr">Venba is a game that has been on my radar since its announcement trailer was released in 2020. It comes from a mainly South Asian development team, with its aesthetics, character designs, and sound design drawing its inspiration from the culture to tell a story about a South Asian family trying to reclaim and archive their own underrepresented culture after immigrating to Canada. It is an incredibly ambitious title to pursue when many video games do not try to engage with having cultures or identities outside of the white/western represented.</p><p dir="ltr">Venba is about trying to figure out your own identity (or sometimes lack thereof) in an all-new environment. This new environment is not kind or accommodating to people who are not considered white, and if you are underrepresented from a culture of color you are swayed and forced to assimilate, leaving what made you unique behind to survive this new place.</p><div>          </div><p>The game starts off in 1988, when Venba and Paavalan, the two main characters, are arguing right after Venba wakes up. Venba wants to make her husband Paavalan lunch, while Paavalan says he will skip lunch so as not to bother her. Since Paavalan is not the best at cooking, Venba gets up and heads straight to the kitchen. This is where the main gameplay mechanics of the game start. You will be making idli, a fluffy rice cake from lentil batter.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/venba-review-tourist-to-your-own-culture/1900-6418096/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Disney's Haunted Mansion: 25 Easter Eggs And References You Missed In The Ride-To-Movie Adaptation

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172061-0.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Disney's Haunted Mansion, out now in theaters, sets out to be both scary and family-friendly. That's a difficult, sometimes contradictory combination, which mirrors the ambitions of the theme park attraction that inspired it.</p><p dir="ltr"><em><strong>Warning: The following contains spoilers for the new Haunted Mansion movie. If you haven't seen it yet, you should steer clear now.</strong></em></p><p dir="ltr">The Haunted Mansion was one of the last rides that Walt Disney himself had a role in creating, though it went through several iterations before the Imagineers settled on the final hodgepodge design. Unable to decide whether to make the ride frightening or funny, the Imagineers opted for a noncommittal mixture of both. That's why we get some parts of the ride that are fearsome, like the hallway of knocking doors; some parts that are silly, like the "swinging wake" in the graveyard; and some parts that ride the line, like the iconic stretching room.</p><p dir="ltr">That the ride manages to balance both is a small miracle, and it's something that both Haunted Mansion movies—this new one and the old, Eddie Murphy-led movie from 2003—struggle to replicate. The new movie does a better job than the old one, to be sure, and it errs on the side of being scarier, rather than funnier. The movie is at its best when it hews closer to its source material, repurposing disparate elements Madame Leota, Master Gracey, Constance Hatchaway, and the Hatbox Ghost into a single, unified narrative.</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond that, though, it's also a Disneyland fan's dream come true as the movie is stuffed with references to the original Haunted Mansion ride, as well as other versions of the iconic experience at the company's parks worldwide.</p><p>Here are 25 Easter Eggs and references we noticed in the new <em>Disney's Haunted Mansion</em>. See something we missed? Let us know in the comments.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. The Right Angle</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172062-1.png" /><br /><h3><p>When we first see the mansion in the movie, it is from the same angle that we first see the Haunted Mansion in Disneyland if we were to approach it from Frontierland when entering the park. The filmmakers stir nostalgic memories by framing this, and other key shots, from a guest perspective.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. Funny Tombstones</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172063-2.png" /><br /><h3><p>At Disneyland, the Haunted Mansion has multiple tombstones scattered across the grounds. On them, the guests can read humorous poems that allude to the deceased people's unfortunate demise. In the movie, these tombstones still have humorous couplets, but they are located in a crawl space beneath the house, where Mr. Crump buried the bodies of his victims.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. Statue Busts</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172064-3.png" /><br /><h3><p>The statue busts that line the hallways are an iconic illusion in the Disneyland Haunted Mansion, and when Guests walk past them, they give the impression that they are turning their heads to follow. Other statue busts, like this one, are based on the more cartoonish busts in Walt Disney World's Haunted Mansion. They were added to the outdoor cemetery in 2011, as a way of enhancing the line queue heading into the attraction.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. Master Gracey</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172065-4.png" /><br /><h3><p>Master Gracey, who is in hiding from the villainous Mr. Crump, is a long-established character in Disneyland's Haunted Mansion, and he is widely accepted (first by fan rumors and later canonically) as the former owner of the mansion, officially known as Gracey Manor. His name is derived from that of Disney Imagineer Yale Gracey, who is responsible for many of the original ghosts' designs.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. Sea Captain</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172066-5.png" /><br /><h3><p>The Sea Captain ghost in the movie is a reference to an early concept for the Haunted Mansion. This unused narrative would have originally revolved around a ghost sea captain who murders his young wife after she discovers he was a pirate, and subsequently hangs himself from the rafters.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. The Stretching Room</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172067-6.png" /><br /><h3><p>This room is a replica of Disneyland's Haunted Mansion Stretching Room--a cleverly designed elevator that the Imagineers used to transport Guests under the Railroad and into the actual building that houses the ride. The four portraits on the wall, which elongate to show a more ghoulish subtext, were designed by Disney Imagineer Marc Davis, who pushed for the Mansion to be more lighthearted than frightening.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. Portrait Obstacles</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172068-7.png" /><br /><h3><p>In the movie, the Stretching Room elongates and materializes deadly elements so that the characters cannot leave. These obstacles correspond to the stretching portraits' respective obstacles: quicksand, a crocodile, and kegs of dynamite.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>8. Were-Tiger</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172069-8.png" /><br /><h3><p>We can see a portrait over the fireplace, which reveals a young woman to be a tiger. This is based on a changing painting in Disneyland, which has the exact same effect. (In an earlier version of the painting, the woman originally turned into a panther--it was changed to a tiger in 2005.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>9. Miss April/December</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172070-9.png" /><br /><h3><p>There is a picture on the stairwell that appears to be heavily inspired by another changing portrait, in which a young woman (April) metamorphosizes into an old woman (December). The characters later discover Madame Leota's seance room behind this painting.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>10. Doom Buggy</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172071-10.png" /><br /><h3><p>The chair that transports Harriet out of the mansion is highly reminiscent of the "Doom Buggies" vehicles in the Disneyland ride, which transport the Guests on a looping conveyor belt through the Mansion's different rooms.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>11. Subliminal Teeth</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172072-11.png" /><br /><h3><p>You'll notice that the bed curtains and bed frame give the impression of sharp teeth. There's lots of subliminal menace throughout both the movie and the ride, which recontextualizes ordinary objects with menacing undertones.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>12. Trippy Staircases</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172073-12.png" /><br /><h3><p>While trying to find Travis, Ben runs into an optical illusion based on a lithograph print by M.C. Escher, named "Relativity." The Disney Imagineers added a similar room to the Walt Disney World Haunted Mansion in 2007.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>13. Endless Hallway</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172074-13.png" /><br /><h3><p>The floating candelabra is a reference to the Endless Hallway sequence in the ride, in which we see a candelabra floating down a long hallway--an effect that uses mirrors to create an impression of infinity.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>14. Hatbox Ghost</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172075-14.png" /><br /><h3><p>The Hatbox Ghost, which is the main antagonist in the movie, has long-established roots in the ride. It was part of the original experience when the Disneyland attraction opened in 1969, but it disappeared soon afterwards, because the optical illusion didn't work consistently. The low number of times that any Guest had actually seen the Hatbox Ghost created numerous rumors, with some people doubting it had ever been in the ride to begin with. The Hatbox Ghost made its triumphant return to the Disneyland ride in 2015. He's set to start haunting the Walt Disney World mansion later this year.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>15. Knight in Shining Armor</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172076-15.png" /><br /><h3><p>The moving suit of armor in the movie is lifted from the Endless Hallway sequence in the ride. For a brief time in 1999, a live actor inhabited the suit of armor and would approach the Doom Buggies to frighten the Guests. However, Guests would instinctively attack the knight, and so Disney dropped the idea shortly afterwards.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>16. Wallpaper</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172077-16.png" /><br /><h3><p>The mansion's wallpaper is taken from the Corridor of Doors sequence in the attraction. The incorporation of eyes into the design was intended to create the anxiety of being watched and scrutinized.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>17. Look At The Time</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172078-17.png" /><br /><h3><p>The grandfather clock, which reads 13 o'clock, is lifted from the end of the Corridor of Doors sequence in the ride. It has teeth surrounding its face, which creates the subliminal impression of a demon, and its pendulum is a pointed devil's tail.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172079-18.png" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Madame Leota is played by Jamie Lee Curtis, a horror movie icon who played Laurie Strode in the Halloween movies. Later, when Madame Leota teaches Harriet the banishment incantation, part of it is lifted directly from the ride's opening spiel. It reads in full:</p><p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 30px;">"When hinges creak in doorless chambers,<br />And strange and frightening sounds echo through the halls.<br />Whenever candlelights flicker where the air is deathly still<br />That is the time when ghosts are present,<br />Practicing their terror with ghoulish delight."</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>19. Ballroom Sequence</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172080-19.png" /><br /><h3><p>Similar to the movie's opening shot, this shot of the ballroom sequence is also supposed to mirror the Guest's perspective in the Disneyland ride, which takes a bird's eye view to hide the use of a mirror optical illusion.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>20. House Organ</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172081-20.png" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">The organist in the movie, who plays ghostly notes, is also lifted directly from the Ballroom Scene in the ride. Some interesting trivia: The organist in Disneyland is playing a real movie prop. It is the same organ as the one in the 1954 film 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.</p><p dir="ltr">The dueling ghosts from the ballroom scene are relocated elsewhere in the mansion for the movie, and they are given a backstory--they are brothers who both fire at the same time during a quarrel, killing each other.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>21. Constance Hatchaway</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172082-21.png" /><br /><h3><p>The haunted bride in the movie has a backstory in the ride; she is Constance Hatchaway, a "black widow" who murders four husbands for their money. (The portrait in the Stretching Room, of an old woman perched on the tombstone of her late husband, is of Constance). In the ride's attic sequence, we see changing portraits of Constance with her different husbands--first with their heads, and then decapitated. We can see these same props during the movie, when Ben explores the attic and runs into Constance's ghost.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>22. Crump Manor</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172083-22.png" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">The Crump Manor in the movie is based on the exterior of the Haunted Mansion in Walt Disney World. Unlike the Orleans plantation mansion in New Orleans Square, the Mansion in Disney World's Liberty Square is Dutch Gothic.</p><p dir="ltr">The name "Crump" is taken from Disney Imagineer Rolly Crump, who worked on the Haunted Mansion in its early conceptual stages and came up with an idea for a "museum of the weird," which ultimately never came to fruition, although elements of it live on in Hong Kong Disneyland's Mystic Manor. Disney decided not to use an explicit ghost theme in Hong Kong, owing to Chinese superstition.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>23. Caretaker Cameo</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172084-23.png" /><br /><h3><p>In the ride, the Caretaker and his Dog are the only two non-supernatural characters in the attraction. In the movie they are ghosts, just like the other 999 inhabitants of the mansion.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>24. Grim Grinning Ghosts</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172085-24.png" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">The attraction's signature song, "Grim Grinning Ghosts" is played throughout the movie as a recurring motif, but it is played for the first time in celebratory fashion at the end of the movie, along with its lyrics. They read in part:</p><p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 30px;">"When the crypt doors creak<br />And the tombstones quake<br />Spooks come out for a singing wake<br />Happy haunts materialize<br />And begin to vocalize<br />Grim grinning ghosts come out to socialize."</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>25. The Hitchhiking Ghosts</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172086-25.png" /><br /><h3><p>The three ghosts that Ben meets during his nightmare are the Hitchhiking Ghosts, which appear at the end of the ride, and appear to "follow you home," thanks to a mirror optical illusion. Their names are Phineas (the top-hatted one with the carpet bag), Ezra (the skeleton with the bowler), and Gus (the short bearded prisoner with the ball and chain). In the movie, unlike the attraction, there's a reason why they're hitchhiking; we can see their wrecked carriage right behind them (perhaps that's also why they died?).</p></h3></p><br />

<p><h2>26 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Villains, Ranked</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/3358072-tmnt.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is back on the big screen with the arrival of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, the new film from producer (and star) Seth Rogen. As is explained in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tmnt-mutant-mayhem-review-the-pizza-crazed-teen-ninjas-pack-a-mighty-punch/1900-6418095/">our review</a>, it's a promising start for the series. However, there's more than  enough history to look back on. After all, it's been nearly 40 years since the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles first debuted in their own comic book. Since then, there have been TV shows, movies, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-weird-story-of-how-the-ninja-turtles-became-a-/1100-6475327/">concert tours</a>, and a shocking amount of action figures. Throughout it all, though, the Ninja Turtles have stood the test of time.</p><p>However, some of the villains they come up against sure haven't. While the TMNT may be bodacious green superheroes, they've also come up against a long list of baddies looking to destroy them and/or the world. While some of them, like Shredder and Krang, are iconic, there are some others that are, shall we say, more lane than anything else.</p><p>Who's great and who's terrible, though? Luckily, we've done the work for you. After scouring through all of Ninja Turtles' history, we've ranked the 26 best and worst villains the heroes on the half shell have ever come up against. Take a look below. And make sure you're ready to see Mutant Mayhem when it hits theaters on August 2. And don't worry, there's already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-mutant-mayhem-series-and-sequel-are-in-the-works/1100-6516329/">a sequel and a TV series on the way</a>.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>26.

What puts them on the list, albeit at the end, is they were clearly ripoffs of the xenomorphs from the 1979 film <em>Alien</em>.</p><p>There have been more dastardly things to come from Dimension X, but rarely have they been so clearly taken from another franchise.</p><p>Image: Lionsgate</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>25.

<p dir="ltr">The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise on the big screen has been a mixed bag, at best. The newest entry, the stylized CGI film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, is a brand-new take on the iconic franchise that introduces the turtles to a younger generation of potential superfans. And this time, the cast and creatives of the film got nearly everything right.</p><p dir="ltr">The first live-action film in 1990 captured the Ninja Turtles in a way that it's hard to believe would be possible, had 1989's Batman not paved the stylistic way. It was dark, gritty, dirty, and incredible. The sequel, Secret of the Ooze, lightened things up by remembering that the Ninja Turtles are first and foremost comic book characters aimed at children. Things swung too hard toward the silly in the third live-action movie, ending that trilogy. From there, we got the animated TMNT, which was a pseudo-sequel to the original trilogy and was pretty decent, plus the two Michael Bay-produced films in which the titular terrapins looked like actual monsters.</p><p dir="ltr">With Mutant Mayhem, producers and writers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg have done the best thing anyone could have done to the franchise, which is nearing 40 years old: They made the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles actual teenagers. They are not only voiced by teenagers but also act like them. They're vulnerable, they're inexperienced, and they're thirsty to see what the world has for them after being kept sheltered from it their entire lives.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tmnt-mutant-mayhem-review-the-pizza-crazed-teen-ninjas-pack-a-mighty-punch/1900-6418095/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo IV's</a> mounts will receive some welcome improvements in an update "coming soon in the future," Blizzard has announced.</p><p dir="ltr">Though they aren't unlocked until fairly far into the game's campaign (after which they are unlocked account-wide for all future characters), <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-mounts-donans-favor-guide/1100-6514616/">mounts are incredibly useful in Diablo IV</a>. The game world is large, and even though there are ways to fast-travel, many of the locations players find themselves traveling to regularly are quite a distance away from the nearest waypoint.</p><p dir="ltr">Mounts do, however, have a few issues. For one, there is a cooldown associated with dismounting and remounting them. That issue goes hand-in-hand with the fact that the creatures of Sanctuary love erecting barricades. These barricades stop mounts in their tracks and require players to either try and go around them (which is sometimes impossible), or dismount, destroy the barricade, and then wait for the mount cooldown to reset before being able to proceed on their merry way.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-mounts-are-getting-a-much-needed-upgrade/1100-6516419/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## American Pie Star Says He Was Paid Tiny Sum For Starring Role

<p>Every actor hopes to land their big break eventually, but that starring role might not come with the riches that filmgoers expect. In a recent interview (via <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/07/american-pie-star-seann-william-scott-reveals-tiny-pay-cheque-from-starring-role-in-hit-comedy-1235450822/">Deadline</a>), actor Seann William Scott said that he was paid $8,000 for his starring role in the hit comedy American Pie, explaining that it "was a lot of money for me at the time."</p><p dir="ltr">Scott said that he spent roughly $5000 to $6000 on a used Ford Thunderbird, and that it made him feel like he made it. He then revealed that he ended up working at the LA Zoo as a "churro guy" to make ends meet following his purchases. Scott also had roles in notable films of the 2000s, including Dude Where's My Car, Final Destination, and the Dukes of Hazzard. He has appeared in numerous American Pie sequels, including the most recent, 2012's American Reunion. A fifth sequel to the franchise is reportedly in development.</p><p>Hollywood's actors' union SAG-AFTRA is currently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollywood-actors-begin-strike-today-oppenheimer-stars-leave-premiere-first-strike-since-1980/1100-6515940/">on strike</a>, along with the Writers Guild of America. The two organizations cite current labor conditions, economic fairness, low residuals, and the dangers of AI as key reasons for the strikes. The Writers Guild of America strike began on May 2, and the SAG-AFTRA strike began on July 14, and neither seem to show any sign of ending. This has led to major disruptions for both television and film production, including in-progress projects like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-jumps-out-to-record-setting-start-globally/1100-6516022/">Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part 2</a>, which writer Christopher McQuarrie recently described as "40% done." This will likely lead to delays in major projects, if not outright cancellations.</p>

<p> </p><p dir="ltr">The film industry received a much-needed boost with the success of Barbie and Oppenheimer, proving the enduring appeal of original theatrical films. Many now wonder if the Barbenheimer phenomenon is a fluke or a new path to sustained success for Hollywood.</p><p dir="ltr">Count Francis Ford Coppola among the optimists. The director of Apocalypse Now was asked about Barbie and Oppenheimer in an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/francisfordcoppola/">Instagram AMA on his personal account</a>. "I have yet to see them," Coppola said (via <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/francis-ford-coppola-barbie-oppenheimer-new-golden-age-cinema-1234889826/">IndieWire</a>). "But the fact that people are filling big theaters to see them and that they are neither sequels nor prequels, no number attached to them, meaning they are true one-offs, is a victory for cinema."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/francis-ford-coppola-declares-a-movie-golden-age-after-barbie-and-oppenheimers-success/1100-6516415/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## "Gnarly" Tom Cruise R-Rated Film Project Is Still In The Works

<p>Outside of comic book movies, Tom Cruise is arguably the closest thing that modern Hollywood has to a bankable action star, thanks to Top Gun: Maverick and the Mission: Impossible franchise. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-part-one-everything-we-know-about-tom-cruises-next-movie/2900-4528/">Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One</a> director Christopher McQuarrie recently re-confirmed that Cruise will star in a "gnarly" R-rated project that's been in the works for a while.</p><p dir="ltr">In a recent "<a href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-part-one-10-spoiler-facts-christopher-mcquarrie/">spoiler special</a>" with Empire, McQuarrie stated that he and his Dead Reckoning co-writer Erik Jendresen have developed a script that would star Cruise and would have a "very un-Tom character" as its hero. He further said that people on the internet have referred to the project as "The Gnarly Movie," which I sincerely hope is not its final title.</p><p dir="ltr">While it's nice that McQuarrie and Cruise are collaborating on a non-franchise production, it will likely be several years until we actually see it on the big screen. Before they can begin production on it, Cruise, McQuarrie, and co. have to finish Dead Reckoning Part Two, which McQuarrie says is about 40% complete. Considering that the film is slated for a June 2024 release, that'll be a hard deadline to meet, given the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollywood-actors-begin-strike-today-oppenheimer-stars-leave-premiere-first-strike-since-1980/1100-6515940/">ongoing strikes</a> in the film industry over pay disparity, the threat of AI, and more. It's unclear if it will be delayed.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gnarly-tom-cruise-r-rated-film-project-is-still-in-the-works/1100-6516411/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
