<p>Apple has created a counter-intuitive business success with iPhones across the last couple of years. It's managed to <a href="https://www.applemust.com/with-iphone-14-apple-just-upsold-the-planet/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">upsell the world</a> to purchasing its more expensive Pro models, and <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3703608/apple-unofficially-calls-action-on-iphone-15-rumor-season.html">we think it aims to do the same again this year</a>.</p><p>The company has recognized that when it comes to the computer that is always with you, customers want the best device they can afford. That’s not to say lower-cost models don’t sell, because they still do; but from Apple’s point of view, it makes solid business sense to set prices and features in such a way that shoppers are always tempted to stretch to a much better model for a few dollars more.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3703670/now-samsung-hints-the-age-of-cheap-smartphones-is-over.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
