One would think, judging by the elitist reaction to "Try State in A Small Town" that the crowd would boo him off the stage. Or at least put on some performative outrage outside of the concert. Nope. As it turns out, the small town of Mansfield, Massachusetts it's down with Aldean's message.</p><p>Aldean was fired up. As was the crowd.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Aldean mentioned the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing and how Boston came together as a "large' small town, adding that had anyone found the two bombers before the cops did they would have beat the sh*t out of them. The audience exploded over that one, though I'm sure if I fired up the Google I could find a journalismer blasting him.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>Aldean continued, "This is not about race, it’s about people getting their shit together and acting right, and acting like they’ve got some common sense."</p><p>Aldean concluded, “I don’t give a shit what color you are. If you’re acting out, burning down buildings, costing taxpayers all this money, just for you to go and show that you’re pissed off, to me, I just don’t get that. We are just never going to see eye-to-eye on that.”</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

## Paul Reubens (Pee Herman) dies, issues an apology to fans for keeping his six-year cancer battle private

He was seventy years old.</p><p>The announcement was made <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CvXme4ZxAR0/" target="_blank">on his Instagram page</a> about the actor and comedian: "A gifted and prolific talent, he will forever live in the comedy pantheon and in our hearts as a treasured friend and man of remarkable character and generosity of spirit."</p><p>It includes Pee Wee's last message to his fans. An apology:</p><blockquote>"Please accept my apology for what I've been facing for the last six years. I have always felt a huge amount of love and respect from my friends, fans, and supporters. I have loved you all so much and enjoyed making art for you."</blockquote><p>I say this both as someone who lost his mother this year to cancer and as someone who had his fifth-grade teacher tell him to stop writing Pee Wee Herman stories for creative writing assignments, it's not something that anyone ever needs to apologize for.</p><p>Reubens "Pee Wee Herman" characters started of for adults, including a late HBO comedy special of "children's" show "The Pee Wee Herman Show." This led to an actual Saturday morning kids show "Pee Wee's Playhouse" and the movie "Pee Wee's Big Adventure."</p><p>Then one day in a Florida adult movie theater, Reubens was caught "playing with his bike" in public. It seems silly considering what celebrities can caught doing (and get away with doing) these days. Herman addressed the situation in hilarious fashion at the 1991 MTV Music Video Awards: "Heard any good jokes lately? So funny I forgot to laugh."</p><p>There has been a lot made <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-rogan-wokeness-comedy-movies" target="_blank">about how Hollywood</a> doesn't <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/adam-devine-theo-von" target="_blank">let comedies be made anymore</a>. In the 80s and 90s, around the time when movie rentals became a thing, we'd watch our favorite comedies so many times the dialogue would be our vernacular. The VERY FIRST movie my friends and I had memorized backward and forwards. To this day when someone makes a Large Marge reference or says "I'm a loner Dottie, a rebel" it still gets a chuckle. And I'd be surprised if a week goes by where an Alamo tour guide doesn't get asked where the basement is.</p><p>And if you ever read me using "Exhibit Q" to describe a plethora of examples in a blog post, that's from Pee Wee too. JUPITER WAS ALIGNED WITH PLUTO. THE MOON WAS IN ITS SEVENTH...</p><p>Thoughts, prayers, and a "Mecka-lecka-hi mecka-heinie-ho" to his family and friends. Rest in Peace, Pee Wee. Ride your boke toward the light.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: Our new hero insists on buying fruit with cash at a cashless store, defies them to call the police as he leaves

But the seventh is from his son Hunter Biden -- yes, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/hunter-biden-third-laptop" target="_self">THAT Hunter Biden</a> -- knocking up his former assistant.

## Now leftists are giving Toby Keith the Jason Aldean treatment over a 21-year-old song about beer and horses

It was so that we could learn to keep up with current events. It was a more innocent time before I learned how deep corporate media bias and hackery went. Newsweek has since turned into a clickbait farm and the latest piece of content they created is about another "pro-lynching" country music anthem. Toby Keith's "Beer for My Horse." Yes, the song from twenty-one years ago.</p><p>The reason why we're here is because of Jason Aldean. I trust most of you <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jason-aldean-plays-try-that-in-a-small-town" target="_blank">are up to speed on the story</a>, but here's the tl;dr. In May, Aldean released a song called "Try That in A Small Town." In July, he released a video. A few randos on social media claimed without evidence the video was racist, pro-lynching, and pro-gun. The media created content "reporting" that it was all those things. Middle America told them to suck it. We had a culture war. Now Aldean <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jason-aldean-hot-100-sales" target="_blank">has one of the top songs in America</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/old-toby-keith-song-beer-horses-slammed-over-lynching-lyrics-1815391" target="_blank">Newsweek is reporting</a> that the twenty-one-year-old Keith song is pro-lynching too. Their source for this is a lone TikToker who said so, calling on Gen Z to "put Toby Keith on blast." Because Newsweek is "reporting" something, <a href="https://www.pennlive.com/news/2023/07/toby-keith-slammed-for-song-that-literally-talks-about-lynching.html" target="_blank">other media outlets start reporting it</a> as well. </p><blockquote>"'Grandpappy told my pappy back in the day, son a man has to answer for the wicked that he done. Take all the rope in Texas, find a tall oak tree, round up all them bad boys, hang them high in the tree for all the people to see." What the f***?</blockquote><blockquote>"We got too many gangsters doing dirty deeds. We've got too much corruption too much crime in the streets. It's time the long arm of the law put a few more in the ground." Literally advocating for police violence and police killings.</blockquote><p>Literally not doing any of that.  </p><p>Let's set aside the first line quoted is sung by Willie Nelson and we here at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website will not allow any Willie Nelson slander. The song is a Western. They aren't singing about 2020, or ever 2002 when the song came out. They're singing about the old west, or the mythology of it at least. Movies like <em>Silverado</em> and <em>Young Guns</em>, where Kevin Costner's and Emilio Estevez's characters were set to be hung at high noon for committing crimes. SPOILER: They're both cracker ass-crackers. </p><p>The sad thing is this isn't even new outrage. It's a reboot of 2015 outrage when Toby Keith performed the song on the Stephen Colbert Show. The Huffington Post lashed out at the performance, claiming the audience was clapping along to a pro-lynching anthem. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/story/toby-keith-hits-back-at-accusation-song-is-pro-lynching" target="_blank">Toby Keith wasn't amused</a>:</p><blockquote>The song was a hit and the words 'lynch' and 'racism' has never come up until this moron wrote this blog ... It's about the old West and horses and sheriffs ... and going and getting the bad guys. It's not a racist thing or about lynching.</blockquote><p>I doubt Toby will pay any mind to this new outrage. He's got more important things to do, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/toby-keith-cancer" target="_blank">like recovering from cancer</a>. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
