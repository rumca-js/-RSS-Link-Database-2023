The Utah-based band recently wrapped up the Tiny Desk Contest On The Road tour, headlining eight sold-out shows across the country. While on the road, Hardyman caught up with NPR to reflect on the life-changing win and also share the story behind Little Moon\u2019s winning song, \u201cWonder Eye.\u201d\n\nHardyman tells NPR the song was written during the time her mother-in-law was in hospice care. The melody came to Hardyman as she and her husband Nathan Hardyman, who is also part of Little Moon, drove from Utah to Idaho to visit his mother. \n\nDuring this difficult time, Emma and Nathan Hardyman were also in the process of leaving the Mormon church in which they had grown up. \n\n\u201cAnd pretty quickly, just because of the circumstances, I realized that this song, this melody, was about death,\u201d says Emma Hardyman, who wrote the structure of the song before asking Nathan Hardyman to write the lyrics. \n\nThe couple were also observing the disintegration of many of the building blocks their Mormon belief systems were built on. \u201cI\u2019ve grieved past versions of myself throughout my whole life,\u201d Emma Hardyman shares.\n\n\u201cI really love where Mormonism brought me,\u201d Emma Hardyman says. \u201cIt introduced me to teachings that are supposed to love everybody, that are supposed to incorporate everybody. [But] it couldn\u2019t follow me to how much I wanted to take [those teachings] seriously,\u201d she adds, noting that many of the Little Moon band members are queer. She says Mormonism didn't align with how she wants to treat people 'without conditions.'\n\nEmma Hardyman also shares that she had many self-doubts about herself as an artist when she and Nathan Hardman met \u2014 but that he believed in her from their very first date. And in \u201cWonder Eye,\u201d the two even find peace in not having all the answers. Emma sings: \u201cIs there a knowledge that is found not in knowing?\u201d as she\u2019s met with the warm hums of the band.\n\nPhoto Credit: Farah Sosa for NPR", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAjUrh-p8fw", "date_published": "2023-07-31T09:00:23+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/QAjUrh-p8fw/hqdefault.jpg"}]
