I was recently reading Byron Barton's 1981 book, </span>

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Building-House-Mulberry-Books-Barton/dp/0688093566">Building
a House</a>.  While it claims to be an end-to-end overview of the
process of modern (for the time) home construction, there are enough
errors in the illustrations that I wouldn't recommend it as a basic
text.



<p>

For example, here's how they show installing a subfloor:

</p>

<p>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/building-a-house-floor-big.jpg"><img class="mobile-fullwidth" height="455" src="https://www.jefftk.com/building-a-house-floor.jpg" width="550" /><div class="image-vertical-spacer"></div></a>

</p>

<p>

There are several issues with the depicted method.  The biggest one is
that the seams do not fall on joists.  This leaves the ends
unsupported.  The diagram shows nails at the joints, but those nails
are doing nothing: they go through the panels into empty space.  If
your joist spacing doesn't match your panels you need to trim them.
They've also installed the panels the wrong way around: you'll make a
more even and less squeaky floor if you run the long dimension
perpendicular to the joists.

</p>

<p>


Or, here's how they show framing the exterior walls:

</p>

<p>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/building-a-house-exterior-wall-framing-big.jpg"><img class="mobile-fullwidth" height="495" src="https://www.jefftk.com/building-a-house-exterior-wall-framing.jpg" width="550" /><div class="image-vertical-spacer"></div></a>

</p>

<p>

That window is not framed correctly.  Not only is the header a single
horizontal 2x when it should be a pair of vertical ones, but they've
left off the jack studs entirely.

</p>

<p>

They also show the electrician installing ungrounded ("two prong") outlets:

</p>

<p>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/building-a-house-electrical-big.jpg"><img class="mobile-fullwidth" height="447" src="https://www.jefftk.com/building-a-house-electrical.jpg" width="550" /><div class="image-vertical-spacer"></div></a>

</p>

<p>

Grounded outlets have been required since the <a href="https://forums.mikeholt.com/threads/old-code-1971-and-modern-code.43704/">1975
NEC</a>, and had been best practice in new construction for about a
decade.

</p>

<p>

Later they show installing pre-hung windows, which is fine, except
that they say to do this after the drywall has already been
installed and the hardwood floors have been laid:

</p>

<p>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/building-a-house-installing-windows-big.jpg"><img class="mobile-fullwidth" height="461" src="https://www.jefftk.com/building-a-house-installing-windows.jpg" width="550" /><div class="image-vertical-spacer"></div></a>

</p>

<p>

There are a bunch of reasons why you'd want to install the windows
earlier, but a big one is that until your windows are installed any
interior finishings are exposed to the elements.

</p>

<p>

The book is also seriously incomplete, with no discussion of
insulation, drywall, heating, siding, and other core issues.

</p>

<p>

While the book continues to be a popular introduction to the topic,
with <a href="https://find.minlib.net/iii/encore/search/C__Sbuilding%20a%20house%20barton__Orightresult__U?lang=eng&amp;suite=cobalt&amp;fromMain=yes">20
copies</a> available in my local library network, I can't recommend it
as a reference.
