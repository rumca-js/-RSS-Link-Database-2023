Arkansas is the fifth state to have an age-gating statute enter force and is the fourth to be geo-blocked by the parent company of Pornhub, the Montréal-based firm MindGeek owned by Ethical Capital [&#8230;]

I didn’t think we had much reason to write about all of the Harlan Crow / Clarence Thomas stuff that I’m sure you’ve read elsewhere. But the latest (in a now increasingly long series) of mind-blowing revelations from ProPublica regarding the relationship between the billionaire and the Supreme Court Justice… actually has a somewhat bizarre [&#8230;]

The regulation will continue until internet freedom improves, apparently. Last year we wrote about Senator Michael Bennet pushing a terrible “Digital Platform Commission” to be the new internet speech police, and now we have the bipartisan free speech hating duo of Senators Elizabeth Warren and Lindsey Graham with their proposal for a Digital Consumer Protection [&#8230;]

The self-proclaimed free speech warriors of the Republican party have spent much of the past half-decade trying to find some way to force social media platforms to carry their often-objectionable speech. That&#8217;s what these asshats and hypocrites consider to be the real &#8220;censorship:&#8221; the actions of private companies these same people have long stated should [&#8230;]
