<p>It seems like everyone and their <s>mother</s> subsidiary companies are jumping on the red-hot mechanical keyboard trend. The latest entrant is 8BitDo, best known for its retro-style <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1931939/8bitdo-ultimate-bluetooth-controller-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">(and surprisingly advanced) game controllers</a>. The manufacturer is staying in its comfort zone with its first keyboard design: The Retro Mechanical Keyboard is offered in two colorways, styled after either Nintendo&rsquo;s Japanese Famicom or the American Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) complete with big 80s-style graphics and control knobs. </p>

</blockquote>



<p>But that&rsquo;s not all. In addition to a rotary switch for Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless, a dial for volume, and three extra buttons above the function row, the keyboard comes with two massive, separate buttons styled after the A and B primary action buttons on the NES controller. These wired add-on &ldquo;Super Buttons&rdquo; can be programmed for individual keys or macros. With four inputs, you can connect up to eight buttons in total (with two included in the box and additional sets of two available for $20 each). </p>

<p>Surprisingly, this isn&rsquo;t just a novelty board &mdash; it includes a lot of the same features as <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406235/best-gaming-keyboard.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">the best gaming keyboards out there</a>. 8BitDo has put some serious hardware into the build, including PBT keycaps with an &ldquo;MDA-like&rdquo; profile, hot-swap switch sockets (Kailh BOX switches included in the, um, box), N-key rollover, programming via 8BitDo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ultimate&rdquo; software, <em>and </em>on-the-fly macros&hellip;this is a serious gaming keyboard and shockingly affordable at just $100. (Keep in mind, that&rsquo;s <em>with </em>the two Super Buttons.) The only thing missing on the usual keyboard spec list is RGB lighting, but that wouldn&rsquo;t fit with the retro theme and there is a big red power light in the upper-left corner. </p>



<p>The 8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard is <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.8bitdo.com/retro-mechanical-keyboard/&amp;xcust=2-2-2013580-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">up for pre-order now</a>, shipping on September 20th.

## Opera GX sanitizes your browsing history after your death

<p>Opera GX has long marketed itself as the browser for gamers. You can set how much memory, processing power, and network connectivity it can use, and it&rsquo;s rife with extra features devoted to maximizing your play-time experience. </p>



<p>Now, the company behind the browser has now released an interesting <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/operagxofficial/status/1684610511663398937&amp;xcust=2-2-2013692-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new feature</a>: After your death, the browser will clean up your browsing history and replace it with an embellished version of your Internet travels.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">We just released a feature that automatically replaces your search history with a nicer one after you die <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://t.co/PTBIauw2xE&amp;xcust=2-2-2013692-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/PTBIauw2xE</a></p>&mdash; Opera GX (@operagxofficial) <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/operagxofficial/status/1684610058728898576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=2-2-2013692-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">July 27, 2023</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The fake My History feature is activated if you leave Opera GX unused for 14 consecutive days. It then assumes you are either dead, or using a new browser, which the company jokingly says is the same in their eyes. The browser then deletes your history and replaces it with a fake version. For example, your survivors can see how you volunteered, and you don&rsquo;t have to worry about your friends ever finding out that you had to Google guides to find all the collectibles in that game you were bragging about.</p>

<p>Check Point says the increase is partly due to an extensive phishing campaign that alerted Microsoft account holders to unusual activity on the account. These types of fake alerts are very popular with fraudsters because they create a sense of urgency and urgency. At worst, we are tempted to click on links and files we would normally recognize as fraudulent, giving attackers access to our computers and accounts.</p>



<p>Google also climbs significantly from sixth to second place, up to 19 per cent. Apple completes the top trio with 5.2 per cent of phishing attempts. The rankings on Check Point&rsquo;s quarterly list tend to fluctuate greatly, so the information in it should be considered fresh.</p>

## How to transfer Wi-Fi passwords to another computer

<p>Windows creates a separate profile for each Wi-Fi network you&rsquo;ve successfully logged into. Your Wi-Fi profile saves the network password so that if your Windows PC comes within range of this wireless network again, it can log on automatically without requiring you to enter the password again.</p>



<p>If you own several PCs or are switching from an old computer to a new one, it&rsquo;s therefore helpful to transfer the Wi-Fi profiles saved by Windows. There are several ways to do this.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-manual-way-to-transfer-wi-fi-passwords">The manual way to transfer Wi-Fi passwords</h2>



<p>First, use the right mouse button to click on a free space on the desktop and select &ldquo;<em>New -&gt; Folder</em>&ldquo;.</p>



<p>Then give the folder a name of your choice, for example &ldquo;<em>Wifi_Backup</em>&ldquo;. Click on the folder with the right mouse button, go to &ldquo;<em>Show more options</em>&rdquo; and click on &ldquo;<em>Copy as path</em>&ldquo;. </p>



<p>Open the command prompt with administrator rights: Type <em>cmd</em> into the search field of the task bar and click on &ldquo;<em>Run as administrator</em>&rdquo; on the right side of the window. Now enter the command &ldquo;<em>netsh wlan export profile key=clear folder=&rdquo;[path to backup folder]</em>&ldquo;.</p>



<p>Replace <em>[path to the backup folder]</em> with the previously copied path. For example, if you created the folder on the desktop as described, the full command is &ldquo;<em>netsh wlan export profile key=clear folder=&rdquo;C:\Users[username]\Desktop\Wifi_ Backup</em>&ldquo;, where &ldquo;[username]&rdquo; is your username in Windows. Then press <strong>Enter</strong>. Windows will now create an XML file in the backup folder for each existing Wi-Fi profile. You can open these files with any browser. In the line that begins with &ldquo;<em>&lt;keyMaterial&gt;</em>&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll also find the Wi-Fi password in each case. </p>

<p>Then copy the backup folder to the second computer using a USB stick or via digital sharing. Once that&rsquo;s done, open a command prompt with administrator rights on the second PC. Now enter the command <em>netsh wlan add profile filename=&rdquo;[path to XML file]</em>&ldquo;<em> user=current</em> and replace &ldquo;<em>[path to XML file]</em>&rdquo; with the path to the XML file that you want to transfer to the new PC.</p>



<p>The easiest way to do this is to right-click on the file as described above and then select &ldquo;Copy as path&rdquo;. The complete command looks like this: <em>netsh wlan add profile filename=&rdquo;C:\Users[username]\Desktop\WLAN_Backup\fritzbox.xml</em>&ldquo;<em> user=current</em>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="transfer-wi-fi-passwords-to-another-pc-with-windows-account-syncing">Transfer Wi-Fi passwords to another PC with Windows account syncing</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="sync wifi passwords windows 11" class="wp-image-2006460" height="824" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wifi-sync-password.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>You can initiate a synchronization of your WLAN passwords with your Microsoft account in the &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; of Windows in the user accounts.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>



<p>The big disadvantage of this method is that it requires a lot of typing and you can only transfer the Wi-Fi profiles to Windows one at a time. The second method, in which you synchronize the passwords via your Microsoft account, is much more convenient.</p>



<p>To do this, open the Windows &ldquo;<em>Settings</em>&rdquo; in the Start menu and go to &ldquo;<em>Accounts -&gt; Windows Backup</em>&rdquo; (see the image above). Make sure that the switch for &ldquo;<em>Save my settings</em>&rdquo; is set to &ldquo;<em>On</em>&rdquo; and click on the downward pointing arrow next to it.</p>



<p>Check &ldquo;<em>Passwords</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>Other Windows settings</em>&rdquo; and repeat these settings on the second PC. Windows will then ensure that the same Wi-Fi profiles are available on both computers. However, the disadvantage with this method is that your passwords will be transferred to the Microsoft cloud and stored there. So if you&rsquo;re concerned with security you may want to use an alternative method. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="transfer-wi-fi-passwords-with-netsetman">Transfer Wi-Fi passwords with NetSetMan</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Netsetman" class="wp-image-1963803" height="697" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Netsetman.png" width="949" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>The freeware Netsetman offers the possibility to export the Wi-Fi passwords stored in Windows to a stick or another medium and thus copy them to another computer.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Roland Freist</p></div>



<p>Finally, you can also organize password syncing using a free tool. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.netsetman.com/en/freeware&amp;xcust=2-2-1963799-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Netsetman </a>can either be installed directly on Windows or started from a USB stick. Install and open the program and click on the Wi-Fi symbol on the left-hand side. Switch to the &ldquo;<em>Profiles</em>&rdquo; tab to get a list of the saved Wi-Fi profiles.</p>



<p>Next, select a Wi-Fi profile and click on &ldquo;<em>Export</em>&ldquo;. Determine whether the password should be saved encrypted or in plain text and select a folder. Netsetman saves the data there as an XML file. Repeat this process for all other Wi-Fi profiles you want and copy the folder to a USB stick or share it digitally. </p>



<p>Download the XML file(s) to the second computer and install Netsetman. Here, call up the list of Wi-Fi profiles and then click on &ldquo;<em>Import</em>&rdquo; to transfer the data from the stick to Windows and voil&agrave;! You now have all of your Wi-Fi profile passwords on your new computer.</p>

Build 25915 also includes a fairly big adjustment for anyone who uses multiple monitors, at least one of which is a high-refresh gaming display. According to the Windows Insider Blog, this latest build will better handle high-refresh tasks on multiple monitors, allowing different refresh rates to be set independently. </p>



<p>While Windows can currently handle different refresh rates on multiple screens, it&rsquo;s in a fairly basic way. With the &ldquo;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/07/27/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-25915/&amp;xcust=2-2-2013528-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">improved refresh rate logic</a>,&rdquo; it should be able to handle, say, a 240fps game of <em>Counter-Strike </em>on one display and a 120fps YouTube video on the other (as noted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.neowin.net/news/windows-11-to-get-graphics-improvements-for-high-refresh-rate-displays/&amp;xcust=2-2-2013528-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">NeoWin</a>). Assuming that your GPU doesn&rsquo;t melt through your machine trying to do both of those tasks at the same time, of course. That&rsquo;ll be especially handy for users who have gaming laptops and gaming monitors, which might have different refresh rates on each screen. </p>



<p>The update notes also say that this mode will be disabled when operating in battery-saver mode on a dynamic refresh rate display, which only makes sense. DRR is a feature enabled on a tiny number of laptops, primarily Surface devices. To <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1072273/windows-insiders-can-test-out-dynamic-refresh-rate-on-external-displays.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">get it working on an external high-refresh monitor</a>, you&rsquo;ll need both the monitor and a fairly recent PC that can handle WDDM 3.1 &mdash; though of course, desktop monitors don&rsquo;t benefit as much from the power-saving capabilities. Both changes should be coming to the release version in a few months.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="asus-rog-strix-g16-design-and-build">Asus ROG Strix G16: Design and build</h2>



<p>Road-testing Asus&rsquo;s Zephyrus M16 back in May this year was a real treat, but as a gamer there&rsquo;s something to be said for playing on a laptop that&rsquo;s unashamedly styled for gamers. With that being the case, sending the M16 back to Asus and receiving the Strix G16 felt like trading a perfectly nice Mercedes Benz for a hotted-up Dodge Viper. Yes folks, when two laptops are almost as powerful as each other and with similarly gorgeous visuals, it can all come down to styling, which the G16 has in spades.</p>



<p>As you can tell, that gamer-centric aesthetic got me in hook line and sinker. What impressed me the most? I really dug the cyberpunk look, especially the transparent ASDF, QWER keys and spacebar, which were not only see-through, but they were also all nicely illuminated by RGB.</p>



<p>The RGB lightbar along the bottom front looks brilliant too, as it produces a sublime under glow that lights up your tabletop. Then there&rsquo;s the neat cutlines with ROG type and a large unmissable Asus logo on the lid, all of which offer a depth to the laptop&rsquo;s overall aesthetic.  Large ROG type on the right-side of the keyboard provides even more flair from in front.</p>



<p>The G16 comes in two color variations: grey and green. I usually try to avoid grey laptops that feel too much like productivity rigs. They just make me feel like I should be wearing an outdated op-shop tweed suit or something. But the grey color isn&rsquo;t your average dull metallic grey this time. No, it even looks a tad black from afar, so it oozes sophistication.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Strix G16" class="wp-image-2001387" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/side.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>Grey colored laptops need not be boring. The finish on the Asus ROG Strix G16 is both attactive and stylish.&nbsp;</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>The laptop&rsquo;s dimensions make it reasonably portable, too. It measures 13.94 x 10.39 x 0.89 inches, which is a lot smaller and easier to carry than its giant 18-inch cousin the Asus ROG Strix G18. That compares with the Razer Blade 16&rsquo;s longer, but slightly thinner chassis which measures 13.98 x 9.61 x 0.87 inches. I didn&rsquo;t mind the slight extra chunkiness, especially since I know laptops with a bit of extra thickness tend to have thermal benefits when things heat up.</p>



<p>Of course, the chassis is just the right size to deliver you a gorgeous 16-inch ROG Nebula display. Asus has achieved no mean feat in making it the main course to be enjoyed at least three times a day. Indeed, the G16 delivers an impressive 90 percent screen-to-body ratio, so there&rsquo;s plenty of it to see. This generous screen-to-body ratio is achieved mostly thanks to ultra-thin bezels, which are less than 4 mm thin. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, a 16:10 contrast ratio means the display is decadently taller than laptops with 16:9 formats &ndash; so quite simply, you can just see more action in your games.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The result is definitely food for thought&hellip; If that&rsquo;s what our model with i7-13650HX CPU can do, one can only imagine what the models sporting Intel&rsquo;s zippier i9-13980HX CPUs can do. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Although you can&rsquo;t see the G16&rsquo;s internal componentry in our images, it deserves a shout out too. Asus claims the G16 benefits from 15 percent cooler CPU and GPU temperatures thanks to an overhaul from predecessor models. A redesigned chassis constitutes the biggest of those changes; it&rsquo;s been especially engineered to accommodate the laptop&rsquo;s new heatsink.</p>



<p>This heatsink has three sections and is built around the motherboard to maximize airflow and the pathing for hot air to escape. An extra fan has been added to make a Tri-Fan system, which works alongside the seven heat pipes and Conductonaut Extreme liquid metal that cools the CPU and the GPU in the RTX 4080 variant.</p>



<p>Are there any compromises in the design? You&rsquo;ll need to look hard to see any, but I <em>was</em> a little concerned at first by the base of the chassis, which contains a little more plastic than some rivals. </p>



<p>After a while, though, I was convinced that despite that being the case, it&rsquo;s actually quite solid. There was no such doubting the lid, however, which feels exceptionally strong. It&rsquo;s obviously made with a good dollop of metal to prevent flex. The whole chassis also has a very tough finish that, for the month or so I had it, held up nicely to bangs and prods without racking up any damage.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="asus-rog-strix-g16-keyboard-and-trackpad">Asus ROG Strix G16: Keyboard and trackpad </h2>



<p>The Strix G16&rsquo;s keyboard and trackpad are just ideal for competitive gaming. You get a full-sized keyboard with full-sized arrow keys, as well as dedicated hotkeys at the top. The hotkeys are all programmable, but in their default setting they allow you to control the laptop&rsquo;s fan settings, volume, microphone and to quickly access Asus&rsquo;s companion software app. which is called the Armoury Crate.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Strix G16" class="wp-image-2001414" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Keyboard-edited.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>The see through keys on the Asus ROG Strix G16&rsquo;s keyboard add a heap of flair and look brilliant at night time.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>My review unit didn&rsquo;t have a numpad, which I found a little inconvenient at times, but you can get a model that illuminates a numpad in the trackpad itself, which wins Asus some points for creativity. The keys also feel quite springy. They provide a generous 2 mm of travel. Programmable per-key lit backlighting makes them a delight to play on at night.</p>



<p>I found the laptop&rsquo;s trackpad to be large and spacious. It also felt reasonably quick. Although you will find quicker and smoother trackpads out there, Razer&rsquo;s Precision Trackpad is one that comes to mind. Still, with the trackpad merely a secondary thought in competitive gaming these days, what you get here is perfectly suitable for an occasional frantic swipe and tap.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="asus-rog-strix-g16-display-and-webcam">Asus ROG Strix G16: Display and webcam</h2>



<p>Asus&rsquo;s ROG Nebula branding conjures up imagery of deep space, but it simply refers to the G16&rsquo;s QHD+ display with 240 Hz refresh rate and three millisecond response time. </p>



<p>In my view, this resolution/refresh rate/response rate combination is one of the best you can currently get, usually producing nicely detailed images but without the glitching or tearing. It&rsquo;s a lesser-known fact that perfectly smooth performance on 4K displays can still be a bit beyond the hardware capabilities of some laptops right now.</p>

<p>In any case, the G16&rsquo;s display has been honed for exceptional performance. The backlighting provides a decent 500 nits of peak brightness and looks very bright. In fact, the panel did a fine job rendering colors &ndash; I particularly noticed vivid reds and greens in the games I was trialing. </p>



<p>The contrast was perfectly fine too, with the dark areas of maps looking very menacing in games like <em>Sniper Elite 5</em> and <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>. Plus, Nvidia&rsquo;s G-Sync support seemed to all but eliminate screen tearing so I could simply enjoy video and gaming in splendid uninterrupted motion.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Strix G16" class="wp-image-2001433" height="751" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-06-22-122819.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>A Sniper Elite 5 screenshot taken on the Asus ROG Strix G16&rsquo;s QHD+ display.&nbsp;</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>The G16&rsquo;s display is also Pantone Validated for those who might want to use it for design work. As we&rsquo;ll see in the performance section, the laptop is certainly powerful enough for this kind of work. Although, to me, it seemed like the Strix G16&rsquo;s panel doesn&rsquo;t quite render images as accurately as Asus&rsquo;s ROG Zephyrus Duo 16, which is a little more fine-tuned for creators.</p>



<p>A 720p webcam fits into the top bezel in a specially designed alcove. It produces images sufficiently, but they&rsquo;re generally of a lower quality than I would have liked. I didn&rsquo;t find myself taking too many screenshots while in video chats. Still, something is better than nothing and so long as you don&rsquo;t need to do any important Zoom calls where video quality is critical, it will do the trick nicely.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="asus-rog-strix-g16-connectivity-and-audio">Asus ROG Strix G16: Connectivity and audio</h2>



<p>The large majority of the Strix G16&rsquo;s connectors are located on the left-hand side of the laptop which means if you&rsquo;re a left hander it&rsquo;s going to get mighty cluttered there and may interfere with your mouse hand. Asus could have remedied this by placing some of the ports along the back side, like we see in the Alienware X15 R2. But alas any such creative port placement seems to have become a casualty of the air vent which comprises the laptop&rsquo;s whole posterior length.</p>

<p>Still, the port selection is very generous. You get multiple USB-A ports, a USB-C port and Thunderbolt 4 port for ancillary gadgets like your mouse, phone and an external SSD. Counting the display-capable ports reveals three, so there are plenty of options to stream games or videos at LAN catch ups too.</p>



<p>When it comes to audio, the Strix G16&rsquo;s two bottom-facing speakers do a passable job creating a rich and varied tonal landscape when you&rsquo;re playing music from an audio app or listening to music in games. </p>



<p>However, in some games I did notice that vocals in the lower tonal range sounded a little hollow. That&rsquo;s most likely because the acoustics from the downward facing speakers have to bounce off my tabletop before hitting my ears. Still, Dolby Atmos support is an asset to the G16&rsquo;s audio offering, really elevating the sound experience, especially in dramatic scenes. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="asus-rog-strix-g16-cpu-performance">Asus ROG Strix G16: CPU performance</h2>



<p>My review unit came with an Intel Core i7-13650HX CPU, part of Intel&rsquo;s new Raptor Lake mobile CPU lineup. This processor, which is built using a 10-nanometer manufacturing process, integrates six Performance Cores (P-cores) and eight Efficiency (E-cores) and has a maximum of 20 threads. It benefits from a higher maximum frequency of 4.9 GHz (that&rsquo;s all-core (P-core) performance) and also has a bigger cache compared with its Alder Lake equivalent, the Intel Core i7-12650H.</p>



<p>To test our laptop&rsquo;s CPU performance against the silicon in other high-performance gaming laptops, I put together a list of comparisons. This lineup included gamer-centric laptops like the Alienware X15 R2 and the 2023 Razer Blade 16. The recently released Asus ROG Zephyrus M16 was also added to the comparisons, providing a useful yardstick against another 16-inch laptop in Asus&rsquo;s 2023 lineup.</p>



<p>Looking first at the results of the Cinebench R20 Multi-threaded benchmark and in the graph below you can see the G16 topped the field of seven, beating both the Asus ROG Zephyrus M16 and the Razer Blade 16. This is an excellent result, thereby proving this laptop can easily handle CPU-intensive applications that utilize all the cores of the laptop&rsquo;s CPU like AAA games or video editing.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Strix G16" class="wp-image-2001741" height="627" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cinebench-1.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>Moving on to the Handbrake test and the results are similarly impressive. This time the G16 finished encoding a 30GB MKV file to MP4 using the Android Tablet preset in just 746 seconds. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Strix G16 " class="wp-image-2001475" height="558" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-20-202016.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>This is one of the quickest scores we&rsquo;ve seen this year and proves the Strix G16 is exceptionally good at keeping its thermals in check while powering through a CPU-intensive task. While other laptops needed to throttle performance sooner in this task, our review unit was better able to control and dissipate its heat load to continue encoding with gusto.</p>



<p>These results bide extremely well for gamers. Without me having to boost CPU performance in Armoury Crate, the Strix G16 managed to outclass a field of gaming laptops whose CPUs are all a class act. The result is definitely food for thought&hellip; If that&rsquo;s what our model with i7-13650HX CPU can do, one can only imagine what the models sporting Intel&rsquo;s zippier Core i9-13980HX CPUs can do!</p>



<p>The results are also a testament to the performance capabilities of Intel&rsquo;s new 13th generation HX Series CPUs. Intel places its HX CPUs above its H Series enthusiast processors to offer gamers and creators what it claims is &lsquo;the best possible performance currently available in laptops.&rsquo; </p>



<p>Suffice to say, gamers can be confident that the Strix G16 won&rsquo;t just run their AAA games, indeed it will deliver some of the best performance they can currently find in a 16-inch laptop.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="asus-rog-strix-g16-gaming-performance">Asus ROG Strix G16: Gaming performance</h2>



<p>The GeForce RTX 4060 discreet GPU in our review model is a step-up from the entry-level GeForce RTX 4050 in Nvidia&rsquo;s mobile GPU lineup. One of its biggest drawcards for gamers for this new video card is its 24 ray-tracing cores, which kind of supercharge the rendering of light and shading in games and 3D applications, allowing for more realism than was ever possible before.</p>



<p>The GeForce RTX 4060 also supports DirectX 12 Ultimate, which is the latest version of the DirectX API and the one that will ultimately power a whole new generation of AAA games. It&rsquo;s a decent piece of hardware with some good future proofing support. This particular RTX 4060 GPU was tuned to a TGP of 140 watts, which is the maximum possible.</p>



<p>To get a general gauge of the graphics processing power on offer, I ran the 3DMark Time Spy benchmark on our review unit. Again, the result was very favorable. While the Razer Blade 16 with its premium RTX 4090 GPU stood head and shoulders above the pack, the Strix G16 with its more modest RTX 4060 GPU was only slightly off the pace of the Asus ROG Zephyrus M16, which packed a sportier RTX 4070 GPU. </p>



<p>Furthermore, the Strix G16 demonstrated comparable graphics performance to the Alienware X15 R2, whose RTX 3080 GPU was considered one of the most powerful in 2022. This is a terrific result considering the lowly placement of our laptop&rsquo;s GPU in the hierarchy of Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX 40 Series graphics cards.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Strix G16" class="wp-image-2001759" height="574" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/3DMark.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>When I ran the <em>Rise of the Tomb Raider</em> benchmark, the Strix G16 averaged 155 frames per second. This result placed it third among our group of comparisons behind the Razer Blade 16 and the Asus ROG Zephyrus M16.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Strix G16" class="wp-image-2001716" height="598" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ROTTR.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>Finally, we ran the benchmark for the game <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em>. Here again, the G16 placed third in the performance results. Again, we can say it comfortably outpaced the Alienware X15 R2, confirming its dominance of this laptop in our games benchmarks.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Strix G16" class="wp-image-2001788" height="584" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOTTR.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>What do these results mean? Overall, they&rsquo;re very encouraging. They show the G16 can hold its own against laptops with more powerful GPUs and also produce faster frame rates than laptops with older, but more premium GPUs. </p>



<p>In summary, this suggests not only is the Strix G16 powerful enough to simply run AAA games, but rather gamers can expect competitive standard performance even if they opt for a less expensive model with an RTX 4060 GPU.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="asus-rog-strix-g16-battery-life">Asus ROG Strix G16: Battery life</h2>



<p>The Strix G16 impressed me in my laptop testing, but not so when it came to evaluating the laptop&rsquo;s battery life. To test the battery, I set a 4K Hollywood movie to repeat, after adjusting the sound to 50 percent and switching off the keyboard backlighting. Wi-Fi was also switched to airplane mode to prevent any disruption to the video.</p>



<p>In the graph displayed below, you can see the Strix G16 lasted just 448 minutes before it ran out of juice and shut down. That&rsquo;s just over seven hours of video playtime. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Strix G16" class="wp-image-2001794" height="620" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Battery-life.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>This result implies that the G16 is just an average performer when it comes to battery life and suggests it&rsquo;s likely to last only three to four hours while gaming away from an AC outlet, which is nothing to write home about.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="asus-rog-strix-g16-should-you-buy-it">Asus ROG Strix G16: Should you buy it?</h2>



<p>On balance the Asus ROG Strix G16 hits all the right notes for performance, functionality and style. Not only does it deliver excellent CPU and GPU performance, all the ports you need, and a slick cyberpunk attitude, but it also has a gorgeous display and is priced considerably lower than at least one key rival. </p>



<p>Sure, it has some shortcomings, like the average battery life, more plastic in its chassis than some competitor laptops, and a low-resolution webcam. But with performance this good, those quirks fall by the wayside.</p>

## I bought advanced GaN USB-C chargers for all my gear. Hereâ€™s why you should too

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>I need another USB-C charger like I need a hole in my head. And as it turns out, I apparently needed another <em>seven holes </em>in my head.</p>



<p>Yes, no lie, in the last two weeks I spent my own cash on seven new <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1915376/best-laptop-usb-c-pd-chargers.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">GaN USB-C chargers.</a> This is from a nerd who literally has an overflowing box of USB-C chargers.</p>



<p>What kicked off my decision to buy chargers I didn&rsquo;t think I needed, but wanted, was the desire to trim as much weight off as possible. This happened during a 15-day vacation in Japan where my family and I walked multiple 12+ mile days and the weight of a 65-watt dual-port charger and a 10,000mAh battery pack began feeling felt like a lead weight. Like a competitive cyclist, I wanted to shave as much weight from my load as possible&mdash;even if it was a few grams.</p>



<p>Luckily Japan never abandoned retail electronics. Visiting no less than 10 different stores, I was able to physically touch dozens of USB-C GaN chargers and read the specs on the chargers themselves.</p>



<p>I came away from Japan with what seemed like the best fit for my needs: Elecom&rsquo;s 45-watt, CW102 GaN II-based charger (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BM92X8DK/ref=emc_b_5_i?th=1&amp;tag=pcworld02-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here&rsquo;s a cuter and pricier version of it on Amazon</a>). It was a little chunkier than I had aimed for but with its 45-watts of power, I could run a small laptop and more importantly, the Elecom charger supports the optional USB-PD Programmable Power Supply or PPS standard. Despite having a large array of USB-C chargers, none of them supported PPS. While I have ignored that in the past, my GaN charger adventure taught me what I was missing.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img alt="GaN chargers" class="wp-image-1992266" height="356" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Table.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1112" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The Anker 511 Nano 3 is the lightest and most powerful of my USB-C GaN chargers.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Gordon Mah Ung</p></div>



<p><strong>Why you want a charger with PPS</strong></p>



<p>All USB-C chargers support USB-PD (power delivery) charging voltages in large steps of say, 3 volts, 5 volts, 9 volts, 15 volts, and 20 volts. PPS, however, allows for a much finer grain control of voltage and offers a continuous range, such as 3 volts to 16 volts in very small 20mV steps. While a standard USB-C charge rate can look like large steps, PPS can look like a curve and is constantly renegotiated every few seconds based on what the phone&rsquo;s battery tells the charger it needs.</p>



<p>Besides offering a much smoother charging curve, a PPS charger can result in cooler charging inside the phone as the conversion inside is offloaded to the charger and better matched to its needs. This, in turn, can lead to faster charging as well as less stress on the battery during charging, which can result in a longer service life for a phone&rsquo;s battery.</p>



<p>PPS sounds great, but it also requires the phone to support it too. Today, many Android-based phones and tablets support PPS, but it&rsquo;s not universal as Apple hasn&rsquo;t embraced the technology. My Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra does support PPS, though, and the only way to trigger the phone&rsquo;s Super Fast Charge mode is with a 45-watt USB-C charger that supports PPS. Google&rsquo;s newer Pixel lineup as well phones from Asus and others also support PPS charging.</p>



<p><strong>Not small enough, not light enough</strong></p>



<p>With three Elecom chargers in my basket (I anticipated losing them as gifts, loss, and to permanent &ldquo;borrowers&rdquo;) I thought I had all the GaN chargers I&rsquo;d need for the next few years. It was a pleasure to ditch the power bank and larger charger I had brought on the trip for the Elecom.</p>



<p>When I arrived back in the United States however, Amazon&rsquo;s Prime Day was in full swing and one of the chargers I had eyed, but decided wasn&rsquo;t a great deal in Japan popped up on my radar: Anker&rsquo;s popular 511 Nano 3 charger for $16.99. Not to be confused with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Durable-Compact-Included/dp/B099F558S1/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1MB6YU8ZR2P7S&amp;keywords=anker%2Bnano%2B511&amp;qid=1689198336&amp;s=electronics&amp;sprefix=anker%2Bnano%2B51%2Celectronics%2C174&amp;sr=1-2&amp;th=1&amp;tag=pcworld02-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">original Anker 511 Nano Pro charger</a>, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Foldable-iPhone-Included/dp/B0B42T3Y48/ref=sr_1_1?crid=8YTSSGUI7CPG&amp;keywords=anker+nano+511+nano+3&amp;qid=1689198447&amp;s=electronics&amp;sprefix=anker+nano+511+nano+3%2Celectronics%2C144&amp;sr=1-1&amp;tag=pcworld02-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">newer 511 Nano 3 charger </a>increases the charge rate from 20 watts of the original Nano to 30 watts. More importantly, while the original Nano supported pretty basic USB-PD at 5 volts and 9 volts and no PPS, the 511 Nano 3 supports 5 volts, 9 volts, 15 volts, and 20 volts as well as two PPS profiles. The newer Nano 3 also features folding prongs which I prefer to prevent bent prongs when stowed.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="GaN chargers" class="wp-image-1992267" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1-5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>Proof: I did indeed buy four of these Anker 511 Nano 3 GaN chargers.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Gordon Mah Ung</p></div>



<p>Its most important feature though is its weight. The 511 Nano 3 is extremely light, coming in at 39 grams on my scale, for a 38 percent reduction in weight versus the Elecom charger. Yes, it&rsquo;s also a 33 percent reduction in wattage too, but I know in reality most phones don&rsquo;t run at the maximum charge rate very long and the reduction won&rsquo;t matter too much.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So as insane as it sounds, a week and a half after buying three GaN chargers on vacation, I came back and bought an additional four GaN chargers this Tuesday. Insane? Sure, I get that, but realizing just how tiny and powerful and far more advanced these newer GaN chargers are, I actually think it makes sense to upgrade my chargers as I&rsquo;ve upgraded my phone.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a great convertible laptop, the Acer Chromebook Spin 713 will surely fit the bill. You can either prop it up like a tent or fold the screen all the way back and use it like a tablet. We were also impressed with its vibrant display, all-day battery life, and diverse selection of ports. The design is a little utilitarian, but this is the kind of machine that favors function over aesthetics. The build is robust and there was hardly any flex in the keyboard tray. There are a couple of downsides like the loud fan noise and the lack of a physical privacy shutter on the webcam, but these issues are relatively minor. Overall, the Spin 713 is a solid convertible laptop that performs well.</p>

<p>After Google decided to shut down its Stadia cloud gaming service, most people wrote off Chromebooks as viable options for gaming. But Lenovo is keeping the hope alive for gaming Chromebooks with its IdeaPad 5 Gaming. It comes with a Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. Lenovo also gave the IdeaPad 5 Gaming a bright 16-inch 2560&times;1600 display and surprisingly good speakers. </p>

<p>Sure, it might not be able to handle the most graphically demanding games. You&rsquo;ll also need to do most, if not all, of your gaming through a cloud gaming service, as ChromeOS doesn&rsquo;t support most modern games. But the IdeaPad 5 Gaming Chromebook is more than capable of streaming games from the cloud at good resolutions and up to 120Hz. If you don&rsquo;t mind paying the monthly fee for a cloud gaming service, this Lenovo Chromebook will having you gaming with the best of them.</p>

<p>The HP Chromebook x2 11 is a solid folio-style laptop, meaning the keyboard and kickstand detach, leaving you with a sub 1-pound tablet. Besides being lightweight, the battery life is impressive. The keyboard is suitable for long typing sessions and the kickstand keeps the tablet nice and stable. The 1440p touchscreen display is beautiful, too. Colors looked vibrant and smaller details were sharp and easy to see. The Snapdragon 7c processor is fast enough for general use as well. The only real drawback is the over-sized touchpad, which tends to fire off a few false clicks here and there. If you can live with an occasionally temperamental touchpad, then the x2 11 is a fantastic option, especially if you travel a lot for work.</p>

<p>The Acer Chromebook Spin 513 has a lot going for it in a compact design. It has a 13.5-inch, 3:2 aspect ratio display with sharp resolution and a surprising amount of screen space. It also comes with an enjoyable-to-use keyboard sporting large keys that have a nice tactile feel when typing. But what truly makes the Spin 513 stand out is its exceptional battery life. In our tests, we found that the battery on this Chromebook lasted for and outstanding 12 hours and 34 minutes in the CrXPRT 2 battery life benchmark test. That&rsquo;s 3 to 4 hours longer than some of the top competitors in the same price range. So if you&rsquo;re looking for a Chromebook that can last a full eight-hour work day or handle a flight across the United States, the Acer Chromebook Spin 513 is your best bet.</p>

<p>For those who like to tinker with their laptops, the Framework Laptop Chromebook is an excellent choice. As is, this Chromebook sports solid performance thanks to its Intel Core i5 processor, Intel Xe integrated graphics, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of SSD storage. But what truly makes it shine is the fact that Framework has built this computer to allow for ultimate customization and upgradability&mdash;you can replace or repair almost every part of the hardware. The 1080p display is also a draw and it comes with hot-swappable ports allowing for even more versatility. Due to this convenience, the price tag is on the higher side for a Chromebook, but it&rsquo;s really targeted for a specific niche of people anyways: those who find enjoyment in tinkering with their gadgets </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>



<p>The PCWorld team puts each and every laptop through a series of benchmarks that test GPU and CPU performance, battery life, and so on. The idea is to push the laptop to its limits and then compare it against others we&rsquo;ve tested. Due to the cloud-based nature of Chromebooks, they go through a series of web-based tests. It wouldn&rsquo;t be fair or possible to run the same kinds of tests on a Chromebook as we use on laptops because they exclusively run a completely different operating system. Below, you&rsquo;ll find a breakdown of each test and the reasons why we run them.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="chromebooks">Chromebooks</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>CrXPRT 2</strong>: The CrXPRT 2 benchmark tests a Chromebook&rsquo;s battery life. </li>



<li><strong>Speedometer 2.0</strong>: This test determines a Chromebook&rsquo;s web browser performance. It simulates this by adding, completing, and removing a to-do list.</li>



<li><strong>Basemark Web 3.0</strong>: This benchmark gauges how well a Chromebook can handle web-based applications. </li>



<li><strong>Kraken 1.1</strong>: Kraken 1.1 is a JavaScript performance benchmark that measures browser speed.</li>



<li><strong>Jetstream 2</strong>: Jetstream 2 is a combination of WebAssembly and JavaScript benchmarks. This is a way to gauge how well a Chromebook runs advanced workloads.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-should-i-look-for-in-a-chromebook">What should I look for in a Chromebook?</h2>



<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a Windows or MacBook alternative, you may want to consider a Chromebook. Equipped with low-power processors, they typically have good battery life and are usually silent in operation. They make great productivity machines, as they&rsquo;re specifically designed for lightweight tasks like browsing the web, watching Netflix, and so on. Plus, they&rsquo;re largely virus free. That said, most Chromebooks have minimal RAM and storage. If you&rsquo;re a hardcore gamer or a video editor, you&rsquo;re going to want something with a lot more power than a Chromebook is capable of providing. </p>



<p>Our guide to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/402141/chromebooks-versus-windows-laptops-which-should-you-buy.html">Chromebooks vs. Windows l</a>aptops can help you determine which operating system is best for your needs. For more options, you&rsquo;ll want to check out our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/436674/the-best-pc-laptops-of-the-year.html">best laptops roundup</a>.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Operating system: </strong>Although every operating system has its pros and cons, I&rsquo;d argue that Chrome OS is one of the most user-friendly ones out there. That said, with Chromebooks, you don&rsquo;t have the option of picking another operating system, as they exclusively run Chrome OS. You&rsquo;re stuck with it, bud.</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: Shoot for a mid-range Chromebook if you can. They cost anywhere in the $400 to $600 range and many of them come equipped with Intel Pentium processors. These Chromebooks have better browser performance and are capable of running more intense gaming apps. It&rsquo;s the best bang for your buck.</li>



<li><strong>RAM</strong>: Many Chromebooks have 4GB of RAM, which isn&rsquo;t a lot. Chromebooks are web-based machines, so you need a fair amount of RAM to keep those tabs open and running smoothly. If you can spend a couple of hundred extra, you&rsquo;ll be able to find a mid-range Chromebook with 8GB of RAM.</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: I recommend at least 64GB of storage. Since you&rsquo;ll mostly be storing things in the cloud, you don&rsquo;t a ton of local storage.</li>



<li><strong>Durability</strong>: Chromebooks are popular in the education market because they&rsquo;re pretty darn robust. I&rsquo;m not saying you should smack one around with a baseball bat or anything, but they&rsquo;re durable enough to handle the daily abuses of life.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-the-difference-between-a-regular-laptop-and-a-chromebook">What is the difference between a regular laptop and a Chromebook?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>When people talk about regular laptops they usually mean a PC or Mac. A Chromebook is still a laptop, but it differentiates itself from either of those two by using a unique operating system called Chrome OS, which was created by Google. Think of it like this: All Chromebooks are laptops, but not all laptops are Chromebooks.</p>



<p>Unlike other operating systems such as Windows or macOS, Chrome OS is optimized to run Google apps such as Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, and other Google services. Because most Google apps are online, Chromebooks generally require an internet connection to use most of their important features.</p>



<p>Finally, Chromebooks have historically been designed with portability, ease of use, and affordability in mind rather than top performance. They typically forego the faster, high-end hardware that PCs or Macs can use for a more minimalist, lightweight approach to computing.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="can-i-use-integrated-graphics-for-gaming">Can I use integrated graphics for gaming?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Yes, some of the latest processors with integrated graphics can run modern PC games at decent enough settings. For example, we found that in our tests, Intel&rsquo;s latest Iris Xe line of processors with integrated graphics can run some of the latest games at 1080p and 30 frames per second. Unfortunately, this is not the case for all integrated graphics and your mileage may vary drastically with older tech.</p>



<p><br />Intel and AMD&rsquo;s integrated graphics have made huge leaps in recent years with regard to gaming performance. If you&rsquo;re on a budget or looking for an ultra-thin laptop with integrated graphics you need not worry, you can still game on. We recommend checking out <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/633378/laptop-graphics-battle-amd-rdna-2-vs-intel-iris-xe.html">Intel&rsquo;s Core 12th-gen Iris Xe or AMD&rsquo;s brand new Ryzen 6000 RDNA 2.</a></p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-the-difference-between-a-budget-laptop-and-a-tablet">What is the difference between a budget laptop and a tablet?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>More and more, the line between what is a laptop and what is a tablet blurs as companies integrate the features of both into their latest devices. But there are still a few key distinctions between the two. Laptops generally are larger, come with more storage, and have better performance and productivity features. Tablets on the other hand are smaller and more portable, have longer battery life, and are usually a bit more affordable.</p>



<p>When choosing between a budget laptop and a tablet you should first ask yourself what the primary use of the device will be. Do you need something for productivity with lots of storage? Then a laptop&mdash;even a budget model&mdash;will probably be the way to go. Or do you need something that is small, travels well, and has a long battery life? Then you might consider a tablet.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="do-chromebooks-make-good-gaming-laptops">Do Chromebooks make good gaming laptops?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>As of right now, not really. But it depends on the type of gaming you intend to do. Chromebooks can handle web games and Android games just fine. However, if you&rsquo;re looking to play the latest high-powered 3D games, a Chromebook won&rsquo;t cut it. This is due to the fact that Chromebooks don&rsquo;t run Windows and they probably have insufficient GPU power.<br /><br />Recently though, Google has been working hard to bring cloud gaming to Chromebooks. This service uses a remote PC or console to play games streamed through the cloud onto the Chromebook. But until this service becomes more widespread, Chromebooks will not be able to handle the best AAA titles.</p>
