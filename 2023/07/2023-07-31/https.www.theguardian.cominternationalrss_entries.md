<p>Straightforward telling of artists David Faulk and Michael Johnstone’s story of love and activism is warm and heartfelt</p><p>Sometimes a hat festooned with plastic straws, Christmas tree baubles and random trash is more than just a hat festooned with plastic straws, Christmas tree baubles and random trash: it’s a political statement – well, sort of. This vivid, effervescent and often moving documentary revolves around David Faulk and Michael Johnstone, two artists who found each other in the middle of the Aids pandemic, fell in love and ended up building not just a life together but a wider community around the drag persona Mrs Vera.</p><p>The latter is incarnated by Faulk, clad like a psychedelic Joan of Arc in an armour of upcycled polyester and tchotchkes, under a thick impasto of makeup – not unlike the inch-thick layers of paint he used to apply on canvases back in his days as a New York-based artist. But once he moved to San Francisco and started making art with life partner Johnstone, the expanding Verasphere became about so much more than just performance. It’s a whole multimedia construction, involving Johnstone’s luminous photographs, film-making, collaborations with friends and allies and, most endearing of all, craft workshops where Faulk and Johnstone teach people how to wield glue guns like real pros as prep for the city’s annual Pride march. The couple’s innate kindness and generosity shines bright, while the miracle of their survival (both have been HIV positive for years and Johnstone almost died) allowed them time to become local legends and fairy godmothers for the community.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/31/the-unabridged-mrs-veras-daybook-review-lovable-profile-of-drag-artist-campaigners">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Yasmeen Mjalli works with women’s collectives to create clothes that use traditional craftwork to tell stories of Palestinian life under Israeli occupation</p><p>Yasmeen Mjalli, the founder and creative director of <a href="https://nolcollective.com/">Nöl Collective</a>, has never met the women who weave the Majdalawi fabric she uses in her collections. It is a notable exception to the close, in-person relationships she has cultivated with her suppliers. Despite living in Ramallah, a city only about 50 miles from Gaza, communication with the women who live within this besieged coastal strip<strong> </strong>takes place solely over WhatsApp. Gaza is described by humanitarians as an “open-air prison” – Israeli laws mean Gazans are rarely allowed out of the city, and other Palestinians who live in the West Bank are even less likely to be allowed in.</p><p>Majdalawi fabric, which is woven using a single treadle loom [a foot-operated machine], originates from the Palestinian village of al-Majdal Asqalan. The village was occupied by Israeli forces in 1948, its inhabitants were made refugees, and the centuries-old practice would have died out if not for a cultural preservation project that set up a handful of studios in Gaza in the 90s. This artisan is one of the local women’s cooperatives that Nöl Collective works with to create sustainable, stylish clothes that blend traditional Palestinian designs with modern, fashionable cuts that wouldn’t look out of place in a Scandinavian storefront.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jul/31/fashion-is-inherently-political-the-woman-mixing-palestinian-design-with-sustainable-clothing">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Florida governor tried to outflank Trump on the right. Bad idea. Next to the former president, the devil with the best Republican tunes, DeSantis is a minor fiend at best</p><p>Ron DeSantis has revealed the next phase of his plan to win the Republican presidential nomination by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/25/ron-desantis-president-campaign-staff-cuts">firing 30% of his campaign staff</a>.

A pro-DeSantis political action committee has used artificial intelligence to generate a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/super-pac-desantis-ai-trump-voice-ad-iowa/">video</a> in which Trump’s voice trashes the Republican governor of Iowa.

Several billionaire donors, however, previously enamored of DeSantis’s “electability”, gave notice that they are jumping overboard without the lifeboat of another candidate. Rupert Murdoch withdrew his mandate of heaven, not so privately dubbing DeSantis a “<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/07/murdoch-desantis-loser.html">loser</a>”.

## Pet-sitting is popular – except when you have six hens, an early-rising dog and a sex-pest tortoise | Emma Beddington

<p>It’s wonderful that agencies will find a live-in sitter to look after pets while you go on holiday. But what if nobody likes the sound of your menagerie?</p><p>I spent last month making an offer you absolutely could refuse. “Would you like to spend a fortnight in a Yorkshire suburb with limited public transport, ministering to an absurdly early rising, heavily medicated dog who spurns affection, six lawless bantams who sit on your head without consent and a priapic tortoise who might take a shine to your shoe? For nothing?”</p><p>The fact that, for an annual fee, housesitting sites offer accommodation to people looking for places to stay across the world in return for pet or plant care is one of the few genuine wonders of life in 2023. But what if no one likes the sound of you?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/31/pet-sitting-is-popular-except-when-you-have-six-hens-an-early-rising-dog-and-a-sex-pest-tortoise">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There’s a lot to see just a short rail journey from Edinburgh. Don’t miss out on these stunning Scottish countryside delights – including one of Attenborough’s  ‘wonders of the world’</p><p>Of the half million annual visitors to the Edinburgh International Festival (running from 4-28 August this year), the vast majority don’t leave the city. Which is understandable given the cultural smörgåsbord on offer, and that it takes place in (arguably) the UK’s most attractive city. But it’s also a wasted opportunity given that this is the capital of one of the most beautiful countries in the world, with a wealth of stunning scenery on its doorstep.</p><p>The really epic stuff is up in the Highlands, several hours away, but you can get a taste of Scotland’s unique wild beauty on a day trip from Edinburgh. Here are three suggestions easily reached by public transport that take in a hill walk, amazing wildlife and a famous loch.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/jul/31/edinburgh-beyond-the-fringe-the-best-day-trips-from-the-city-by-train">Continue reading...</a>

## The lesson from the Greece wildfires? The climate crisis is coming for us all | Nesrine Malik

<p>The developed world needs to be shocked out of its complacency about our warming world, and the unexpected effects that will follow</p><p>A surreal video filmed by a tourist in “the most perfect location in Greece” last week, posted to show how “a weekend trip turned into survival mode in 24 hours”, could easily pass for a TV climate crisis awareness-raising campaign. It brings to mind two harrowing adverts <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/stark-ad-shows-life-british-girl-refugee/story?id=39007365">released by Save the Children</a> in 2014 and 2016, showing what life would look like for a British girl if war came to our shores and she became a refugee.</p><p>The brief Greece video unwittingly follows the same script of rapid unravelling: an idyllic waterside scene is instantly transformed, overshadowed by looming fire and smoke, then abandoned for boats, buses and waiting holding pens as hundreds of tired and bewildered people seek shelter and fail to secure flights out.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/31/greece-wildfires-climate-crisis-developed-world">Continue reading...</a>
