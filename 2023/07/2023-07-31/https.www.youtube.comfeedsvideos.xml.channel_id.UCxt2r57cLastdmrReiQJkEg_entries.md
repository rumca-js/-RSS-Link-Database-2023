Grifts and scams have taken over. Everywhere you look online, gurus are offering quick and easy ways to make money. Social media feeds and the YouTube homepage are dominated by "passive income" strategies which promise a sure-fire path to financial freedom.

At the same time, there has been a rise in anti-grifter content too. Creators including Coffeezilla, Dan Olson, MÃ¼necat and Mike Winnet have all dedicated time in recent years to highlighting that making easy money online can actually be a little more difficult than these gurus like to suggest.

Whether you're a financial freedom seeker or a sceptic, it's clear that grifters and scammers are the zeitgeist.

But, while these schemes might initially seem somewhat low-rent marginal, they actually take influence from some of the most successful businesses in the world. And, not in a good way.

This is the story of how grifts and scams took over not just the internet, but the world.
