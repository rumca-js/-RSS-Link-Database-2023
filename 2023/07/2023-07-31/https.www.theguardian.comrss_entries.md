<p>Tair Rada, an Israeli pupil, was 13 when she was found dead in a school toilet. This meticulous, riveting documentary on the case is sensitively handled and never forgets the victim</p><p>Shadow of Truth was first shown in 2016 in Israel, where the murder case it examines is notorious, before being bought a year later by Netflix for global streaming. Now it arrives on the BBC, with the addition of a fifth and final episode to include new information and more recent events. There is a lot to digest. What begins as a seemingly straightforward, if horrifying, true-crime documentary takes flight at the end of the first episode, where it transforms into a much wider story about corruption, conspiracy and justice in Israel.</p><p>Tair Rada was 13 when she was found dead at school in Katzrin, a town of 8,000 people, in the Golan Heights area between Israel and Syria. The documentary starts with a nightmarish interview with Tair’s mother, Ilana, who describes returning home and noticing her daughter’s backpack was not there. Initially, the head of the investigation, retired commander Avi Shai, said there were “no particularly worrisome signs” – after all, children are sometimes late home after school. But after a frantic search into the night, Tair’s body was found behind a locked cubicle door in the school toilets. Official photographs, thankfully shown sparingly, indicate a distressing and gruesome crime scene.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/31/shadow-of-truth-review-an-utterly-gripping-case-about-conspiracy-and-corruption">Continue reading...</a>

This is only for the last few days.” He said targeting civilians was a sign of “the despair and defeat of the Russian Federation at the front”.</p><p>Ukraine’s first lady, <strong>Olena Zelenska</strong>, said “This is how the week begins in a Ukrainian city that just wants a quiet, normal life. Russia wants to take peace and life away”, and offered condolences to the victims and their families.

<p><strong>Dr Vicky Cleak </strong>says the health service must improve access to effective treatment, while <strong>Dr Deborah White </strong>says the blame doesn’t lie with GPs</p><p>I am a consultant psychiatrist who was trained by, and worked in, the NHS, most recently as a liaison psychiatrist in a general hospital. I saw three young men who had made impulsive suicidal attempts where the underlying cause was attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). I was unable to treat them with effective, evidence-based treatment because the psychiatrists in the mental health trust and GP practices locally would not take over the prescribing of stimulant medication. The service was not commissioned locally and the medication was not on the “allowed” formulary.</p><p>There seem to be several reasons why this is the case, including an erosion of senior doctors’ autonomy, a lack of training among doctors, persistent views that ADHD is not “real”, worries that taking it on would overwhelm an already unmanageable workload, and now a burgeoning private sector with financial interests in the NHS not treating it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/31/the-nhs-is-failing-patients-with-adhd">Continue reading...</a>

I figured it would shift our international alignment away from the countries taking the climate crisis seriously, because it’s right in front of them and they are not psychopaths, towards the countries strutting their indifference to it, for the complicated but demonstrable political mileage in the message: “Follow me to hell – it’ll be fun there.”</p><p>It was written right there in his holiday house.

<p>Design director Mårten Brüggemann explains why he set out to make a sci-fi game that’s as much about cultivation as combat</p><p>Video game action-platformers might have had their golden age in the 1980s and 90s with Metroid and Contra, but the genre’s modern resurgence has given us exceptional games such as Dead Cells and Hollow Knight, showing that bone-crunching combat and pin-point platforming still work beautifully together. But how do you breathe new life into this familiar video game form? In the case of Ultros, you complement the usual thrills and spills, with a spot of gardening – an opportunity to slow down and smell the roses.</p><p>Game design director Mårten Brüggemann says the gardening isn’t just about growing resources (although that’s a useful outcome of getting your hands dirty), but deepening your relationship with the game’s teeming, nature-filled world. “You can plant as much as you want, evolving the plants and shaping them in different ways to make hybrids,” he says. “We want to give life to an ecosystem.”</p><p>Ultros is out in 2024 on PlayStation 4 and 5.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jul/31/ultros-a-psychedelic-action-game-about-gardening-in-deep-space">Continue reading...</a>

## Sunak’s plan for carbon capture is good news: he shouldn't muddy it with party politics | Simon Jenkins

<p>Consensus on tackling the climate crisis is what’s needed now – and direct action against CO2 must be the next move</p><p>For as long as the United Kingdom needs to use oil and gas, we should be making an effort to capture any resulting CO2 and store it. That clearly makes sense. It also makes sense to produce our own oil and gas, so we are less beholden to exporters (though of course ours, too, would be sold on the international markets).</p><p>So far, so good for Rishi Sunak’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/30/rishi-sunak-to-use-scottish-trip-to-attack-labour-stance-on-north-sea-oil">twofold announcement</a> today in Scotland. But it would be helpful if he did not muddy these waters by using them to score political points against Labour in the run-up to an election campaign. What we desperately need now, as we confront the climate crisis, is agreement on a way forward. Bringing party politics into it will only hinder progress.</p><p>Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/31/rishi-sunak-carbon-capture-party-politics-climate-crisis-co2">Continue reading...</a>

There is precious little blood to be drawn in LTNs. This is a niche concern, affecting a very small percentage of the population, of whom <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2020/oct/22/despite-a-loud-opposing-minority-low-traffic-neighbourhoods-are-increasingly-popular">only a minority are opposed</a>.

There is, too, an irony in the fact that the “pro-motorist” campaign against LTNs, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2023/07/08/mark-harper-transport-secretary-review-ltns-net-zero/">previously articulated</a> by the transport secretary, Mark Harper, is now being spearheaded by a prime minister whose default transport mode is <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/rishi-sunak-helicopter-travel-ulez-b2384489.html">a helicopter</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/31/rishi-sunak-cars-prime-minister-ulez-low-traffic-neighbourhoods-keir-starmer">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This fiery ‘killer’ spaghetti is, somewhat counterintuitively, actively encouraged to catch and burn, to create a crisp crust</p><p>The origin story – the specific episode or exact moment when someone decides to make something for the first time: an apple fell on my head, so I made a crumble; I burned the pasta, but everybody loved it; the tale of the <a href="https://www.11inchpizza.com.au/the-history-of-the-margherita-pizza/#:~:text=The%20most%20popular,test%20of%20time.">margherita</a>, a pizza for a queen... I love such stories, yet find them a nightmare, too.</p><p>On the one hand, even when fanciful, they recognise a set of circumstances or a person – credit where credit’s due, etc. On the other, in being recognised, these stories and, therefore the recipes, get trapped, often becoming the very opposite of what they once were – a happy accident of resourceful cooking, a record of when someone improvised and made something good. Take Enzo Francavilla, for example. A young chef from a town called Foggia, he moved to Bari in the early 1960s and worked in various places before taking over a joint called <a href="https://www.ristorantealsorsopreferito.com/">Al Sorso Preferito</a>. In a long interview with the journalist and historian Sandro Romano, Francavilla explains that, one night, a couple from northern Italy asked for something good and substantial to eat. “So I invented a plate of spaghetti with a tomato sauce and a generous dose of chilli, prepared directly in the iron pan, making the sauce tighten well and thus creating a tasty external crust.” “<em>Sei un assassino</em>” (“you are a killer”) was the customer’s response and a dish was born.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jul/31/spaghetti-crunchy-crust-all-assassina-recipe-rachel-roddy">Continue reading...</a>

The levels of anxiety among our young children in primary schools have been steadily rising with easy access to online content and smartphones becoming a real threat to childhood.

It was evident that these children were not emotionally ready to navigate the complexities of these devices and the digital world. The anxieties arising from early exposure to adult content online were becoming palpable and, as a community, we knew we had to act.</p><p>Rachel Harper is the principal of St Patrick’s national school, Greystones, Ireland</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/31/pupils-school-smartphones-parents-teachers-social-media">Continue reading...</a>

<p>More than 60 women have made allegations against Cosby – but Constand was the woman whose case resulted in criminal charges. She explains her determination to fight for all the survivors</p><p>When Andrea Constand awoke in the early hours of 7 January 2004, she didn’t know where she was.

But after Russian forces invaded Ukraine, she began investigating war crimes – including the disappearance of a much-loved children’s author</p><p>Victoria Amelina was one of Ukraine’s most celebrated young novelists and poets. Her books looked at the country’s troubled history and she was all too aware of how Russia had attacked Ukrainian artists and culture in times gone by. When the full-scale invasion started, she changed her life – turning her acute powers of observation to investigating war crimes.</p><p>The Guardian’s chief culture writer, <strong>Charlotte Higgins</strong>, was reporting on artists in Ukraine when she met Amelina – and the two swiftly became friends.
