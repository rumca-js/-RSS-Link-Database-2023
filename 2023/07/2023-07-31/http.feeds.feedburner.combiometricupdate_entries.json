NIST reviewed the changes so far, the <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/nist-discusses-new-section-on-vcs-and-mdls-timeline-for-digital-id-updates\">numerous comments submitted</a> about them, and possible further revisions in a recent webinar.\n\nThe changes to biometrics guidelines include a more stringent accuracy requirement for authentication to align with other standards advanced since the previous version was finalized in 2017.\n<h2>Base Volume</h2>\nThe Base Volume for the 800-63 guideline introduces concepts and defines roles and responsibilities for digital identity proofing, enrollment, authentication and federation. It provides risk assessment methodology and sets assurance levels.\n\nThe key changes proposed by NIST include a revamp to the risk management approach to make it more process-oriented, and an amended process for assurance level selection, which also now includes tailoring, Connie LaSalle, senior technology policy advisor at NIST\u2019s Information Technology Lab explains.\n\nThe update to the model supports additional deployment options, specifically including federation, adds a section on continuous system evaluation and improvement, and emphasizes a multi-disciplinary approach to risk assessment and management. Considerations for risk assessments for particular individuals and communities are also included.\n\nIn the new digital identity model, NIST refers to the \u201csubject\u201d of revision 3 as the \u201cholder\u201d of an ID, to better align with current industry terminology. The \u201ccredential service provider\u201d becomes the \u201cissuer,\u201d and \u201crelying parties\u201d are \u201cverifiers,\u201d which includes those doing the verifying and those who use the verified information.\n\nNIST is also planning further consultations to provide guidance on equity within the Base Volume, and risk scoring metrics may be introduced.\n\nLaSalle also noted that some of the feedback was contradictory, with for example organizations asking for decision trees to be reintroduced while others thank the agency for removing them.\n<h2>Enrollment and Identity Proofing</h2>\nThe title for the <a href=\"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63a.pdf\">NIST SP 800-63A</a> guidelines is changing, with \u201cIdentity Proofing\u201d and \u201cEnrollment\u201d switching places, says Ryan Galluzzo, identity program lead for NIST\u2019s Applied Cybersecurity Division. That change is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nThe concept of digital evidence has been introduced, and more clarity on that concept is coming, Galluzzo says. The trusted referee system has been mandated at the system level, and generally updated. A component identity proofing service can provide it, but the system must have a trusted referee, per NIST guidelines.\n\nNew biometric requirements for ID proofing have been added. They are specific to the identity proofing context, as opposed to those in volume B. Performance, testing, consent and privacy requirements for facial recognition have been integrated into the guidance.\n\nIdentity Assurance Level 1 has been overhauled, from \u201cdon\u2019t do identity proofing\u201d in Galluzzo\u2019s words, to \u201ca pretty robust set of controls.\u201d IAL1 is still considered too high-friction by most submitting comments, and NIST is considering further adjustments.\n\nHe also reviewed the introduction of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/more-nuanced-biometrics-test-guidance-and-new-vouching-roles-tipped-for-nist-updates\">Applicant References</a>\u201d who can vouch for others, and Galluzzo noted a variety of feedback, both positive and seeking more detail. Many commenters requested greater clarity for the main roles in identity proofing, including Applicant References but also Proofing Agents, Trusted Referees and Process Assistants. NIST is working on delineating the boundaries of each. Equity impact assessments and evaluations are also being added to volume A.\n\nThe structure of requirements has been updated for greater consistency by popular request, with assurance levels mapped against in-person attended, in-person unattended, remote attended and remote unattended methods.\n\nAdditional fraud checks are being considered, including transaction analytics and consortium data.\n\nSome feedback suggested that NIST should define a baseline of core attributes, but in recognition of the specific needs of different businesses and applications and a desire to avoid mandating over-collection of personal information, it will stick to examples.\n\nNIST is also still considering alternative non-biometric options for identity proofing.\n<h2>Authentication and Lifecycle Management</h2>\nVolume B is the closest to a final version release, and Andy Regenscheid, PIV technical lead for NIST\u2019s Computer Security Division says it has less major conceptual changes than the others.\n\nPhishing resistance is defined, a restriction on cloning cryptographic authenticators is out to organizations can synch keys, and ineffective techniques around passwords, like expirations and complexity requirements, have been removed. Questions during this segment of the event touched on how to think of passkeys in the context of NIST\u2019s guidelines.\n\nBiometric performance requirements have been revised, with mandated false match rates strengthened from 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 10,000. This reflects improvements in the technology, and also better aligns with other standards, like those of the <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/fido-alliance\">FIDO Alliance</a>\u2019s Biometric Certification Program.\n\nPush authentication requirements have evolved, but SMS remains in the guidance as a multifactor authentication tool.\n<h2>Federation and Assertions</h2>\nDavid Temoshok, who leads NIST\u2019s SP 800-63 work from within the Applied Cybersecurity Division, reviewed the changes to volume C.\n\nLike the identity assurance levels, federation assurance levels 1, 2 and 3 have been updated to make them clearer and \u201cmore achievable,\u201d and to include protection against injection attacks.\n\nTrust frameworks have been built into the guidance, and the responsibilities of different parties in trust agreements defined.\n\nProvisioning and identity APIs are considered in the revision, and the concept of federated relying party accounts and controls is now included.\n\nThis volume will also include a section dedicated to new identity credentials, like the W3C\u2019s verifiable credentials and mobile driver\u2019s licenses, in response to submitted comments.\n\nThe public event was followed by a government-only meeting, and the finalized new versions are slated for publication next year.", "link": "https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/biometric-authentication-accuracy-bar-rises-assurance-levels-evolve-in-nist-guidance", "date_published": "2023-07-31T21:50:41+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/biometricupdate", "title": "Papua New Guinea to tap India\u2019s digital public infrastructure experience", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://d1sr9z1pdl3mb7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/21144537/india-train-station-scaled.jpg\" width=\"2048\" />\n\t\tIndia will share the experience of its digital public infrastructure (DPI) known as \u201cIndia Stack\u201d with Papua New Guinea to facilitate identity verification, data sharing and digital payments after the two countries signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU).\n\nThe deal was signed by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) of India and the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology (MICT) of Papua New Guinea in the presence of other top government officials from both countries, according to an Indian government news release.\n\nIt comes after a recent meeting between India\u2019s Union Minister of State for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship and Electronics and IT, Rajeev Chandrasekhar, and Papua New Guinea\u2019s Minister for ICT, Timothy Mark Masiu.\n\n\u201cPrime Minister Narendra Modi has a clear vision for India's technology capabilities. The India stack is now available to any country interested in joining the digitalization trend that has accelerated in recent years,\u201d says Chandrasekhar.\n\n\u201cPreviously, digitization discussions were often centered around disparities between advanced nations and others, but with alliances like this, like-minded countries can cooperate to innovate and implement DPIs (Digital Public Infrastructures) to create a technology and innovation sharing ecosystem.\u201d\n\nDuring the MoU signing ceremony, the officials also had discussions on issues related to digital ID, digital public infrastructure, digital payments, data protection and exchange, digital government, and internet connectivity.\n\nPapua New Guinea is aiming to <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/papua-new-guinea-could-be-heading-for-a-country-wide-digital-identity-system-by-2025\">launch a new national digital ID</a> system by 2025.\n\nBoth countries will use the partnership to implement digital public infrastructure projects aimed at facilitating access to public and private sector services.\n\nIndia signed <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/india-expands-partnership-on-digital-public-infrastructure-experience-sharing-at-g20\">MoUs with four countries</a> in June to share its digital public infrastructure experience with them, and with <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/7-countries-partner-with-india-to-adopt-its-digital-public-infrastructure-model\">seven more</a> in May.\n\nIn the meantime, an <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/pathways-for-digital-inclusion-8868325/\">opinion piece</a> for the Indian Express chronicles how India\u2019s digital public infrastructure development has revolutionized the way citizens get access to public services.\n\nThe article underlines the fact that the India stack has not only made significant contributions to the growth of the country\u2019s economy, but it has also set the groundwork for a financially and socially inclusive society.\n\nThe success of India\u2019s DPI has also attracted the attention of other countries, the article notes, as the country is also using its G20 presidency to make the case for global support of DPI development, especially in developing countries.\n\nIt also recommends that while the global community copies India\u2019s example in the implementation of DPIs, it must take a number of things into consideration. This includes prioritizing user-centric design, inclusion, building stronger engagement and tailoring DPIs to the needs of targeted segments of the population.", "link": "https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/papua-new-guinea-to-tap-indias-digital-public-infrastructure-experience", "date_published": "2023-07-31T20:35:28+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/biometricupdate", "title": "Identity accessibility among barriers to financial inclusion for Nigeria\u2019s rural women", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://d1sr9z1pdl3mb7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/26010708/africa-farmer-phone-scaled.jpg\" width=\"2048\" />\n\t\tHindrances to the uptake of digital identity by women, especially in the rural parts of Nigeria, are among the factors impeding the financial inclusion drive in the country, according to findings of a <a href=\"https://inclusion-for-all.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/I4ALL-IITA-Study-Summary-Report.pdf\">study</a>.\n\nThe study, carried out by the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA) and advocacy group Inclusion for all (I4ALL) in the States of Kano, Oyo and Rivers, was focused on \u201cAccess to identity, empowerment, livelihood and financial inclusion of rural female agricultural workers and traders in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe study notes that despite the productive nature of women in the targeted areas and their willingness to scale up their livelihoods by engaging in more lucrative agricultural practices, they are still held back by several factors, the biggest of which is the lack of capital for agricultural investment.\n\nThe women recognize the importance of having an official ID, which can enable them open bank accounts or register mobile numbers for mobile money accounts, the findings note.\n\nHowever, the study discovers that \u201cthe barriers to NIN enrollment remain consistent, bordering largely on the cost of transportation and enrollment, distance to enrollment centers and tedious enrollment processes.\u201d\n\n\u201cSocio-cultural factors did not emerge as direct barriers to ID enrollment, but the use of religious centers for NIN enrollment in Kano which may have obscured such socio-cultural barriers, suggests that the norms still prevail but can be circumvented,\u201d a portion of the report\u2019s executive summary reads.\n\nThese findings come as figures of the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) indicate that of the <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/digital-id-enrollment-efforts-scale-up-in-kuwait-nigeria\">over the 101 million Nigerians</a> who have enrolled for the digital ID, women make up just 44 percent, The News Guru <a href=\"https://thenewsguru.com/news/44-of-nin-enrollees-are-females-nimc/\">reports</a>.\n\nNIMC Director General Aziz Aliyu, speaking during a recent dialogue in Abuja organized by I4ALL, alluded to a study carried out by the NIMC in collaboration with the World Bank which identified some of the reasons for the gender gap in digital ID enrollment. These factors, he said, include lack of awareness, difficult access to enrollment cites, lack of documentation, and other problems related to biometric capture.\n\nAziz restated the importance of an effective foundational ID system, saying it has the potential to drive financial inclusion and empower women, and also enable access to a wide range of public and private services.\n\nThe Abuja event was also an opportunity for officials to present findings of the I4ALL study.\n\nZaina Sore, IITA head of capacity development said the study was necessary to enable stakeholders better understand the needs and challenges of women in order to \u201ctailor the services that will lead to greater inclusion and economic empowerment.\u201d\n\nChinasa Collins-Ogbuo, I4ALL head, suggested that in order to increase the number of ID uptake among women, there is need for authorities to pay more attention to remote areas.

How much of a threat this development poses to the field of biometrics and to cybersecurity in general was discussed in-depth with Frances Zelazny, CEO and co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/anonybit\">Anonybit</a>.\n\nThey agreed that sophisticated attacks pose a threat that most organizations are still vulnerable to somewhere within their business processes.\n\nThe good news, Zelazny says, is that the basic concepts behind even attacks made with the newest technologies are familiar to professional in the field of cybersecurity. Between the best practices already established within the industry, and the technologies that Khitrov believes are already capable of spotting even sophisticated fakes, so long as they are properly implemented.\n\nZelazny emphasizes the need for the many parts in the lifecycle of the customer identity to be connected properly to each other. A robust biometric identity verification process during enrollment may catch deepfakes and injection attacks, for example, that are subsequently allowed into the system through a less-robust account recovery process.\n\nThe tendency of many businesses to respond to identity fraud challenges by collecting more personal data runs the risk of exacerbating the problem if the stored data is not adequately secured. Breached data both provides the data attackers need to break through the weak point in businesses\u2019 defenses, but also fuels the training of deepfakes used in biometric presentation or injection attacks.\n\nThe webinar is available for free <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/will-deepfakes-deep-six-biometrics-2\">on-demand with registration</a>.", "link": "https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/4-in-10-businesses-have-already-seen-deepfakes-injection-attacks", "date_published": "2023-07-31T19:34:49+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/biometricupdate", "title": "Cyberattack on Kenya\u2019s digital infrastructure continues", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://d1sr9z1pdl3mb7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/20155817/passwordless-authentication-scaled.jpg\" width=\"2048\" />\n\t\tKenya\u2019s eCitizen portal, used by the public to access over <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/kenya-digitizes-5k-government-services-to-issue-digital-ids-in-next-90-days\">5,000 services</a>, has been under a massive attack that has affected the key government online platform for almost a week.\n\nThe hacker collective Anonymous Sudan has reportedly claimed responsibility for several distributed-denial-of-service attacks against digital public infrastructure, according to local trade publication Technext.\n\nThe cyberattack has affected passport, visa, national ID, driver's license and medical record services, according to reports.

ITL has revealed a deployment in Germany, while Telpo kiosks have rolled out to thousands of convenience stores in China, and CyberLink has signed an agreement to work on phone-based retail and hospitality biometrics.\n\nLiquor stores in Germany are using age verification technology from <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/innovative-technology\">Innovative Technology</a> (ITL) to guide staff ID checks, with positive feedback from both staff and customers, according to a company announcement.\n\nTwo franchise locations near Hamburg deployed ITL\u2019s anonymous age estimation, which utilizes face biometrics to direct staff to check the IDs of younger-looking customers.\n\nOne store deployed ITL\u2019s MyCheckr, and the other the MyCheckrMini, which does not include a video screen but otherwise provides the same functionality. The estimated age threshold for ID checks was set at 23 years old, as beer and wine can be purchased in Germany from age 16, while spirits and tobacco products can be purchased at 18.\n\n\"ITL's age estimation products have been welcomed by both staff and customers,\u201d franchisee Stephan Hermann comments. \u201cThey give our staff more confidence when asking for ID and have led to fewer confrontations. It simplifies our work and helps protect minors, and avoid fines as checks by authorities increase. With the one-time initial cost of MyCheckr and MyCheckrMini and the non-recurring fees, I have a cost-effective solution for age verification in my stores. Any store that sells age-restricted merchandise would benefit from this technology, and I highly recommend it. The cooperation with ITL during both the test phase and now is very good, the technical information was a great help.\"\n\nA market analysis from IHL Group on \u201c<a href=\"https://www.ihlservices.com/product/retails-ai-revolution/\">Retail\u2019s AI Revolution</a>\u201d notes that camera-based age verification can reduce staff interventions by up to 80 percent, and reduce how long those interactions take. Age verification is one of the main use cases for AI in retail self-service systems, according to the report.\n\nA leading convenience store chain in China is using kiosks from <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/telpo\">Telpo</a> with face biometrics capabilities for self-service ordering and checkouts.\n\nMeiyijia Convenience Stores operates 32,000 retail locations across the country, and surpassed a competitor for top spot in the industry in China in 2023, according to a company blog post.\n\nThe K10 kiosks from Telpo are integrated with a point-of-sale system built in-house by Meiyijia to support multiple payment methods, including QR code scanning, as well as product scanning.\n\nTelpo kiosks are also being used for <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/mcdonalds-telpo-customize-self-serve-biometric-payment-kiosk-for-china\">self-serve biometric payments at McDonald\u2019s</a> stores in China.\n<h2>Cyberlink partners up</h2>\n<a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/cyberlink\">CyberLink</a> has formed a collaborative partnership with U.S.-based hospitality and retail point-of-sale technology maker <a href=\"https://simpello.com/\">Simpello</a> to integrate its facial recognition.\n\nCyberLink\u2019s FaceMe Platform and SDK are being integrated with Simpello\u2019s proprietary reusable identity and decentralized data technologies for privacy-preserving hotel and retail transactions, the companies have announced.\n\nSimpello technology allows the customer\u2019s phone to operate as an identifier, with a decentralized wallet architecture and transmissions through Bluetooth Low Energy and Ultra-Wide Band. A selfie and unique token stored on the customer\u2019s phone can be used for hotel check-ins without presenting a confirmation in either paper or digital form. Contactless payments with face biometrics in retail environments are conducted in the same way.\n\n\"AI is already creating personalized interactions for customers,\" says Dr. Jau Huang, chairman and CEO of CyberLink, \"We\u2019re excited that the collaboration between CyberLink and Simpello not only creates richer experiences, but also more secure experiences.\"", "link": "https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/retail-face-biometrics-devices-roll-out-in-germany-for-age-checks-china-for-payments", "date_published": "2023-07-31T18:09:07+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/biometricupdate", "title": "Clear spars over TSA report after security incident follows enrollment error", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://d1sr9z1pdl3mb7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/04122413/airport-gate-scaled.jpg\" width=\"2048\" />\n\t\tBiometric security has debuted in a Korean airport and there are plans to install it in Kazakhstan. But a private-industry implementation in the U.S. by biometric verification firm <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/clear\">Clear</a> is experiencing a problem.\n\nHow problematic the Clear deployment is is the source of heated debate, but if nothing else, the argument highlights the one fact few in the industry discuss. AI algorithms, even when collaborating with humans, are imperfect.\n\nU.S. business news publisher Bloomberg last week <a href=\"https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/he-breezed-through-security-with-clear-he-was-using-a-false-identity-1.1951890\">reported</a> that a Clear subscriber a year ago was able board a flight departing Washington National Airport under a fake identity. The suspect allegedly was caught only when a government inspection spotted live ammunition in the person's possession.\n\nBloomberg's account, which it says includes previously unknown details, indicates that the U.S. Transportation Security Administration investigated the incident and came down hard on Clear.\n\nThe government found that some travelers were able to enroll in Clear using Clear-captured photos that contained no recognizable faces. The algorithm reportedly issued an alert on the images, but employees allegedly overrode the flags.\n\nTravel trade publisher One Mile at a Time <a href=\"https://onemileatatime.com/news/tsa-clear-security-concerns/\">posted</a> four images reportedly from investigation.\n\nThe investigation found that <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/airports-in-3-countries-seek-to-balance-fast-traveler-journeys-security\">49,000 Clear subscriptions</a> were flagged by AI because images of individuals did not match.\n\nClear executives almost immediately and emphatically issued a statement saying Bloomberg's article was far off base. They emphasized the time the company spent with the reporters and expressed incredulity that their efforts were not rewarded with vindication.\n\nThe executives say \"the TSA has reverified 4.7 million IDs without citing a single issue\" in the last six months. They are also upset that the government gave reporters the four example photos, although no one can be identified in them.\n\nWhat is more, according to the executives, Clear uses fingerprints and irises to verify subscribers the day they travel, not face biometrics.\n\nMeanwhile, Incheon Airport, in South Korea, is using pre-registered facial information for departures, according to <a href=\"https://koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20230728000502\">reporting</a> by The Korea Herald. The new system has now reached availability at 16 gates, and makes it possible to <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/airports-in-3-countries-seek-to-balance-fast-traveler-journeys-security\">bypass verification completely</a>, including at the boarding gate.\n\nThe service is limited to six airlines right now, according to The Herald. Travelers can use an Apple or Google app to complete an application or use an airport kiosk to register their face template for use in the service. The facial recognition system is expected to be used throughout the airport by April 2025.\n\nThe facial recognition software being used is from <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/alchera\">Alchera</a> and covers check-in, bag-drop, security screening and boarding.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/from-central-asia-to-the-world-digitalization-drive-pushes-new-biometric-startups\">Kazakhstan</a> is behind Korea in this regard. The Central Asia nation has created commission. Commissioners are still addressing questions like how to ensure fluid interactions between the national government and its relevant agencies, according to reporting by The Astana Times.\n\nThey reportedly are nearing \"effective completion\" of their International Civil Aviation Organization biometrics audit.

The technology has found increasing adoption as stores report higher levels of shoplifting and other crime. At the same time, retailers have been complaining that the police are no longer taking retail crime seriously.\n\nResponding to allegations that the Home Office is lobbying in favor of facial recognition cameras instead of more police work, Facewatch\u2019s Gordon said that businesses had the responsibility to look after employees.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the police\u2019s job to look after your staff \u2013 you\u2019ve got to take basic precautions,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/29/well-just-keep-an-eye-on-her-inside-britains-retail-centres-where-facial-recognition-cameras-now-spy-on-shoplifters\">told</a> The Guardian.\n\nGordon also defended Facewatch\u2019s system saying it has few downsides. The images of innocent shoppers are kept on the system for 14 days. With the current accuracy of its camera technology standing at 99.85 percent, misidentification is rare and when they do happen, the implications are \u201cminor,\u201d he says.\n\nIn July 2022, Big Brother Watch <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202208/facewatch-counters-big-brother-watchs-biometric-surveillance-claims-plans-expansion\">filed a complaint</a> against the company and food retailer Southern Co-operative to the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office, arguing that supermarkets were adding customers to secret watchlists with no due process.\n\nIn March 2023, the regulator concluded that Facewatch\u2019s system was permissible under law. But the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office also <a href=\"https://bigbrotherwatch.org.uk/2023/06/update-big-brother-watchs-complaint-to-the-ico-on-retailer-facial-recognition/\">found</a> that the company\u2019s policies had breached data protection legislation on eight points, <a href=\"https://bigbrotherwatch.org.uk/2023/06/update-big-brother-watchs-complaint-to-the-ico-on-retailer-facial-recognition/\">according</a> to documents obtained by the NGO, with Facewatch <a href=\"https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/media-centre/blog-balancing-people-s-privacy-rights-with-the-need-to-prevent-crime/\">promising</a> to address the issues.\n\nSince then, the firm has been <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202304/facewatch-facial-recognition-declared-compliant-with-uk-data-protection-law\">advertising</a> on its website and social media that the regulator deemed it fully compliant with UK Data Protection law.\u201d This month, however, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office said that its approval is overstated and requested the company to stop using its logo in promotional material.
