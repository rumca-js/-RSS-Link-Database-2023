[{"source": "https://www.jefftk.com/news.rss", "title": "\"Building a House\" Review", "description": "<p><span>\n\nI was recently reading Byron Barton's 1981 book, </span>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Building-House-Mulberry-Books-Barton/dp/0688093566\">Building\na House</a>.  While it claims to be an end-to-end overview of the\nprocess of modern (for the time) home construction, there are enough\nerrors in the illustrations that I wouldn't recommend it as a basic\ntext.\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nFor example, here's how they show installing a subfloor:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/building-a-house-floor-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"455\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/building-a-house-floor.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThere are several issues with the depicted method.  The biggest one is\nthat the seams do not fall on joists.  This leaves the ends\nunsupported.  The diagram shows nails at the joints, but those nails\nare doing nothing: they go through the panels into empty space.  If\nyour joist spacing doesn't match your panels you need to trim them.\nThey've also installed the panels the wrong way around: you'll make a\nmore even and less squeaky floor if you run the long dimension\nperpendicular to the joists.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n\nOr, here's how they show framing the exterior walls:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/building-a-house-exterior-wall-framing-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"495\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/building-a-house-exterior-wall-framing.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThat window is not framed correctly.  Not only is the header a single\nhorizontal 2x when it should be a pair of vertical ones, but they've\nleft off the jack studs entirely.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThey also show the electrician installing ungrounded (\"two prong\") outlets:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/building-a-house-electrical-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"447\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/building-a-house-electrical.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nGrounded outlets have been required since the <a href=\"https://forums.mikeholt.com/threads/old-code-1971-and-modern-code.43704/\">1975\nNEC</a>, and had been best practice in new construction for about a\ndecade.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nLater they show installing pre-hung windows, which is fine, except\nthat they say to do this after the drywall has already been\ninstalled and the hardwood floors have been laid:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/building-a-house-installing-windows-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"461\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/building-a-house-installing-windows.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThere are a bunch of reasons why you'd want to install the windows\nearlier, but a big one is that until your windows are installed any\ninterior finishings are exposed to the elements.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe book is also seriously incomplete, with no discussion of\ninsulation, drywall, heating, siding, and other core issues.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nWhile the book continues to be a popular introduction to the topic,\nwith <a href=\"https://find.minlib.net/iii/encore/search/C__Sbuilding%20a%20house%20barton__Orightresult__U?lang=eng&amp;suite=cobalt&amp;fromMain=yes\">20\ncopies</a> available in my local library network, I can't recommend it\nas a reference.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid0281thBo1mBs7KoiZi7JbeyJUvoHdbKyNogcB8GSehuntYpq3CvpFobH42SuTXqaLzl\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://lesswrong.com/posts/kvyHKopJdRKfapxgG\">lesswrong</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/110810316111201319\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/building-a-house-review", "date_published": "2023-07-31T08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}]
