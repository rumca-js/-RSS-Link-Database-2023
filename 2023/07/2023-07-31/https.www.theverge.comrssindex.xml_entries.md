  <p id="qHK0s1">Chevy’s Blazer EV is now going to cost interested buyers quite a bit more. Customers who have ordered the all-wheel-drive RS trim of the electric SUV will see their prices jump to $60,215, up from its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/19/23269768/chevrolet-blazer-ev-announcement-launch-ss-1lt-crossover-price">original announcement</a> of $51,995.</p>
<p id="KJ9KT1">After destination fees, customers can expect to pay about $10,000 more for the 2024 Blazer EV RS AWD, which dealers will start to receive in August. Chevy also plans to build the 2LT AWD versions this fall, which will now cost $56,715 compared to its previous price of $47,595 a year prior.</p>
<p id="FTLHuI">The move is in contrast to recent EV price cuts from automakers like Ford, which reduced prices on its Mustang Mach-E SUV, including the Premium AWD trim, which has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/2/23708146/ford-mustang-mach-e-price-cut-range-orders">dropped from $53,995 to $49,995</a>, and the F-150 Lighting...</p>

In an email obtained by the outlet, Google tells staff members that it has already started exploring a “supercharged” Assistant powered by the newest large language models (LLM), similar to the technology behind ChatGPT and Google’s own Bard chatbot. According to the email, “A portion of the team has already started working on this, beginning with mobile.”</p>
<p id="GX2cj8">As part of this change, Google says it’s condensing the team that works on Assistant. The email obtained by <em>Axios</em> states that the company is “eliminating a small number of roles,” although it’s unclear how many employees are affected.

  <p id="fNoFE3">Samsung’s Galaxy SmartTag 2 appeared in an <a href="https://fccid.io/A3LEIT5600/">FCC listing today</a>, offering us a small preview of what to expect from the forthcoming location tracker (<a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/07/31/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-2-fcc-new-design/">via <em>9to5Google</em></a>).</p>
<p id="wULQiL">Perhaps most notably, the FCC listing refers to one version of the tracker that will come with ultra-wideband (UWB) connectivity for more precise tracking. That doesn’t rule out Samsung releasing a second variant later. The $39 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373410/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-plus-uwb-ar-bluetooth-price-release-date">SmartTag Plus</a> — which combined BLE with UWB — came after the original $29 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227621/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-price-release-date-tile-locator">standard SmartTag</a>, which featured only Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).</p>
<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="6uh7ep"><div></div></aside></div>
<p id="bkWOe6">Another notable difference is that the Galaxy SmartTag’s loop appears significantly larger than that of its predecessor. In fact, it looks bigger than the Tile Pro, which should make it even easier to attach the...</p>

  <p id="NmBGbr">Raise your hand if you’ve tried one of those newfangled hands-free driver-assist systems. Now raise both hands. But for the love of god, keep your eyes on the road!</p>
<p id="XVrWr3">Love them or hate them, hands-free driving systems are becoming more prevalent on the road. Most major automakers offer hands-free driving as an option or a subscription, from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/3/23289019/gm-super-cruise-coverage-expand-400000-miles">GM’s Super Cruise</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/22/23732877/ford-level-3-driver-assist-autonomous-city-streets">Ford’s BlueCruise</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/28/17170736/nissan-altima-propilot-ny-auto-show-2018">Nissan’s ProPilot</a>. (Tesla’s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD) systems are not technically hands-free, a fact that annoys most Tesla owners to no end.)</p>
<p id="soQmLN">But with more hands-free driving entering the realm of what’s possible, more risks inevitably come with it. Last week, GM launched a public education campaign to help customers better understand what...</p>

  <p id="ZB0GA0">Federal authorities and scientists are scrambling to relocate corals from Florida’s coastlines before a killer heatwave wipes them out. </p>
<p id="aOoIpb">The water is unbearably hot for corals, animals whose bodies form the reefs that coastal communities and other marine life depend on. Corals get their color from a symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic algae that provide them with the nutrients they need to survive. Unusually high temperatures, as the Atlantic Ocean is experiencing this summer, drive that colorful algae away. It’s a problem called <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16849336/global-warming-coral-reefs-bleaching-rate-climate-change">coral bleaching</a> that, if it lasts too long, ultimately kills corals. </p>

## How to customize your iPhone’s app icons

  <p id="kNN2IB">Sometimes an app’s icon just doesn’t look right on your homescreen. For example, let’s say — just for the sake of argument — that the icon for a social networking app was switched from a pretty blue bird to a rather stark “X.” Could you change that icon?</p>
<p id="D4hFLk">The answer is yes — it’s doable using Apple’s built-in Shortcuts app. You actually won’t be replacing the app’s official icon. Rather, you’ll be creating a separate shortcut that leads to the app. It’s a tedious and time-consuming process, but in the end, you can have a fully customized iPhone homescreen.</p>
<p id="JTqHfS">Here’s how you do it:</p>
<ul>
<li id="4A9Oyt">Before you begin, it’s a good idea to find an icon for your new shortcut. There are a bunch of icon sources online (<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.flaticon.com%2F&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22529978%2Fapple-iphone-ios-apps-icon-change" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Flaticon</a>, for example), or if you’re artistic...</li>

  <p id="lvsYNz">For the last six years, there have been only three things you can count on: death, taxes, and rumors of a new Nintendo console. Now, a new rumor <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-nintendo-switch-2-targets-2024-with-next-gen-console/">from <em>VGC</em></a> suggests Nintendo’s eyeing a 2024 release for its next-gen console.</p>
<p id="cdlA38">According to sources who spoke to <em>VGC</em>, the new console could feature a cheaper LCD screen instead of a higher-end display like the OLED Switch and continue to include a cartridge slot for loading games. Nintendo executives also hope that the 2024 release window will ensure the console won’t have inventory issues like the ones that plagued the launch of the Xbox Series S / X and PlayStation 5. </p>
<p id="B7vlKx">Switch sales have been cooling lately, reflecting <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23473152/nintendo-switch-console-games-performance">the console’s age and stiffening competition</a> with the more powerful Xbox,...</p>

  <p id="9vLiuR">Since Prime Day was an Amazon event, a lot of the best Prime Day deals we saw earlier this month naturally landed on Amazon’s smart speakers and displays. While Amazon’s deals have since long gone, other retailers are jumping in to give you a second chance if you missed out.
