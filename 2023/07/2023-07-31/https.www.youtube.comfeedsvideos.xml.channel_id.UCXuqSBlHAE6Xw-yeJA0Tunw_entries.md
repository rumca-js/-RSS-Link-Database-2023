It's been a long time coming, but after being moved into Linus' new house we are finally making his ridiculous dream come true. We are watercooling a PC using his pool. That's right, even the hottest components like the Intel Core i9-13900K or the RTX 4090 will be easily cooled by the sheer amount of water. But can we cool Linus' hubris? Also, is this actually going to work?
