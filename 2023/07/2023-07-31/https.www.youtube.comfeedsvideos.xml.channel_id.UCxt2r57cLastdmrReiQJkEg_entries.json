Everywhere you look online, gurus are offering quick and easy ways to make money. Social media feeds and the YouTube homepage are dominated by \"passive income\" strategies which promise a sure-fire path to financial freedom.\n\nAt the same time, there has been a rise in anti-grifter content too. Creators including Coffeezilla, Dan Olson, M\u00fcnecat and Mike Winnet have all dedicated time in recent years to highlighting that making easy money online can actually be a little more difficult than these gurus like to suggest.\n\nWhether you're a financial freedom seeker or a sceptic, it's clear that grifters and scammers are the zeitgeist.\n\nBut, while these schemes might initially seem somewhat low-rent marginal, they actually take influence from some of the most successful businesses in the world. And, not in a good way.\n\nThis is the story of how grifts and scams took over not just the internet, but the world.\n\nWatch this video ad-free on Nebula at https://nebula.tv/tomnicholas\n\nSupport my work on Patreon at https://patreon.com/tomnicholas\n\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/tom_nicholas\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/tomnicholaswtf\nPatreon: http://patreon.com/tomnicholas\nWebsite: http://www.tomnicholas.com\n\nSelect footage courtesy of Getty\nMusic from Epidemic Sound", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bq3SdfzcA4", "date_published": "2023-07-31T12:29:07+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/2bq3SdfzcA4/hqdefault.jpg"}]
