The peloton is strung out and travelling at 57km per hour but remains intact.</p><p><strong>Not long now:</strong> The riders are in the closing stages of the neutral zone and with the intermediate sprint 45 kilometres into the stage, it will be intriguing to see who and how many riders try to form the inevitable breakaway, and whether or not they will be allowed to escape. Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek), for example, has his eye on the green jersey currently occupied by Jakobsen and will presumably fancy his chances of hoovering up some points. In the polka-dot jersey, Neils Powless (EF Education-Easypost) will also hope to be first over the early climb.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/jul/05/tour-de-france-2023-stage-five-takes-race-into-pyrenees-live\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/jul/05/tour-de-france-2023-stage-five-takes-race-into-pyrenees-live", "date_published": "2023-07-05T12:22:31+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "\u2018He lived by the troll, he dies by the troll\u2019: Putin takes on Prigozhin\u2019s business empire", "description": "<p>Kremlin appears to gain control of Wagner warlord\u2019s troll farms as Patriot media operations shut down</p><p>As Wagner mercenaries captured a major Russian military base and began their armed march on Moscow, members of Russia\u2019s federal security services stormed one of Yevgeny Prigozhin\u2019s headquarters in St Petersburg.</p><p>Masked men quickly seized computers and documents belonging to the Patriot group, a media holding at the heart of Prigozhin\u2019s information empire that for years promoted the warlord at home while sowing chaos and interfering with elections abroad.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/05/putin-takes-on-yevgeny-prigozhin-business-empire\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/05/putin-takes-on-yevgeny-prigozhin-business-empire", "date_published": "2023-07-05T12:22:13+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Fiona Phillips is right: life needn\u2019t end with dementia.

In modern-day France, a team of superheroes called the Tobacco Force do battle with bizarrely rubbery monsters. These warriors of virtue are named after the constituent ingredients of cigarettes: Benzene (Gilles Lelouche), Methanol (Vincent Lacoste), Nicotine (Ana\u00efs Demoustier), Mercury (Jean-Pascal Zadi) and Ammonia (Oulaya Amamra). Wearing costumes and helmets, like a cross between the Power Rangers and Daft Punk, they kill these evil beasts by surrounding them and blowing their individual vapours which combine to form fatal cigarette smoke.<br /><br />Their controller is a rat called Didier (voiced by Alain Chabat), with an unsettling resemblance to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2016/mar/31/levis-flat-eric-advert-puppet\">Flat Eric</a>, the puppet created by Dupieux in his earlier career making music videos and TV commercials. After slaying the kind of dragon-creature that Captain Kirk once faced on a distant planet, the team are curtly informed by Didier that they have to retreat to a special training centre to regroup mentally and spiritually, ready for the upcoming war with a new villain: the Emperor of Evil, Lizardin (played by veteran Belgian comic Beno\u00eet Poelvoorde). Once at the camp, the team gather around the campfire and tell each other scary stories, and these bizarre and extraneous pieces of directionless nonsense are tensely dramatised.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/05/smoking-causes-coughing-review-cigarette-superhero-comedy-is-refreshingly-immature\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/05/smoking-causes-coughing-review-cigarette-superhero-comedy-is-refreshingly-immature", "date_published": "2023-07-05T10:00:30+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "NHS waiting lists could go up even more, health minister says on 75th anniversary \u2013 UK politics live", "description": "<p>Health service is in \u2018critical condition\u2019 but public support is \u2018rock solid\u2019, say three thinktanks in letter to political leaders</p><p>The Guardian has been given exclusive access to the health service in Tredegar, the south Wales town that forged the NHS.

This will not end well</p><p>It is important, when considering throwing a family-size wheel of brie at the singer Pink, to meditate on the logistics involved. The first is buying the brie: this alone will have taken some plotting, finding a place that had whole uncut wheels of brie, refrigeration, etc. Then there\u2019s getting the brie there: in all the excitement of getting ready, the outfit changes and the gins-in-tins, the group photos and the sing-a-longs, there is \u2013 always \u2013 a wheel of brie, which is too big for a tote bag and grows heavier by the minute. You need to be near the front, and to get the brie to Pink, you have to choose to do it during the right song (a ballad rather than a bop). And then of course there is the decision that starts it all off: <em>at Pink this weekend, at a gig I bought tickets to months ago and have been growing in excitement for ever since, I\u2019m going to take a big brie and throw it to her</em>. That is not a normal decision.</p><p>2023 has been a good year for pop stars being thrown things on stage.

What\u2019s wrong with y\u2019all?\u201d was the frankly quite measured response.) Less amusingly Bebe Rexha was taken to hospital for stitches after she had a phone thrown at her on stage in New York last month, and country singer Kelsea Ballerini had to pause a gig in Idaho last week after being hit in the face with a bracelet thrown from the crowd.

Meanwhile, one of the hijackers, Alex (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), turns out to be an embedded Interpol agent who in turn conscripts a former doctor, Kim (MyAnna Buring), into helping him revive the pilot temporarily with EpiPen shots in order to get advice on guiding the plane.

That\u2019s what Netflix first figured out, then started to weaponise: a lot of streaming platform television is now, I am convinced, designed to be half-watched, puttered around to. You can make dinner and miss five or six scenes but figure out the gist anyway. The platform autoplays from one episode to the next and you didn\u2019t notice because you took a toilet break without pausing and only twigged when you said, out loud, \u201cthis is a long episode\u201d. You can paint your nails to it, or go on your phone to it, or flutter into a nap. We are living through a peak time in history for pausing episodes halfway through because it doesn\u2019t really matter, and this is because streaming platforms have started methodically making half-TV, to be half-paid attention to.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/05/the-horror-of-dolores-roach-a-hugely-fun-drama-about-turning-dead-people-into-enchiladas\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/05/the-horror-of-dolores-roach-a-hugely-fun-drama-about-turning-dead-people-into-enchiladas", "date_published": "2023-07-05T07:00:27+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "The complete story of the Premier League\u2019s goalscoring record | The Knowledge", "description": "<p>Plus: Bruce Springsteen loving his football grounds, an overlapping season and keepers booked for diving</p><ul><li><a href=\"mailto:knowledge@theguardian.com\">Mail us</a> your questions or tweet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theknowledge_gu\">@TheKnowledge_GU</a></li></ul><p><strong>\u201cAs Harry Kane (213) continues to chase Alan Shearer\u2019s record of 260 Premier League goals, I was wondering who was the last person to lead the chart before Shearer,\u201d</strong> begins Eric Hardy-King. <strong>\u201cHow many different leaders have there been?

Hansberry was one of those 1950s radical Black thinkers who were standing on the shoulders of those who had gone before, such as Marcus Garvey, and laying the groundwork for those who came afterwards, such as the civil rights movement in the 60s and the Black Power movement of the 1970s.</p><p>My first encounter watching her play <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2001/jun/06/theatre.artsfeatures\">A Raisin in the Sun was here at the Young Vic</a> more than 20 years ago, in a production starring Lennie James.
