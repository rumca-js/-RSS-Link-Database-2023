<p>The eternal outsider, with 23 slams, is still summoning feats of sporting ultimacy and keeps lapping the track on his own</p><p>What is it with Novak Djokovic? At times you get the feeling the greatest player in the history of men’s tennis could walk out to face a vaping, white-shorted Phillip Schofield, or a Just Stop Oil pensioner on a wildcard and this most gushing of arenas, a Centre Court that loves nothing more than to fawn over its champions, would still shout “Go on Phillip” or “Let’s Go Oil”, just to break the day up a little.</p><p>On a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/05/my-mission-at-wimbledon-wild-wednesday-87-matches-in-one-day">slow-burn Wednesday afternoon</a> Djokovic did what he tends to do in these early rounds, easing his way up through the revs, refamiliarising himself with his grass-court movements, the preternatural flex and twang on the baseline, the pitter-patter dashes to the net.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/05/novak-djokovic-jordan-thompson-wimbledon-second-round">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘A story that didn’t used to be told’: the rise and fall of baseball’s Negro Leagues

<p>In eye-opening documentary The League, director Sam Pollard tells a fully-rounded tale of how Black baseball used to thrive </p><p>Sam Pollard inherited his love for baseball from his father, a fan of the St Louis Cardinals – Black America’s team in the 1960s. Growing up in New York just made it a long-distance affair. “They had some phenomenal players,” Pollard recalls to the Guardian. “Lou Brock, Curt Flood, Bob Gibson, Bill White. And then when I got to be 14, 15 years old, I really wanted to understand their lineage. Where did they come from?”</p><p>Decades later, the director retraces that Black baseball genealogy in The League – a new Questlove-produced documentary on the rise, fall and last impact of the Negro Leagues, the professional baseball association that sprang up in the long shadow of Jim Crow. It’s a history famously touched on in Ken Burns’s seminal docuseries Baseball. But in The League, the B-story becomes the main thread.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/05/rise-fall-baseball-negro-league-documentary-sam-pollard">Continue reading...</a>

## How civil rights activists are preparing for a post-affirmative action college landscape

<p>The court didn’t explicitly rule out consideration of a student’s race, leaving door open to interpretation of college admissions aims</p><p>Since 1978, when affirmative action in college admissions was <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1979/76-811">first upheld</a> by the US supreme court, civil rights leaders have fended off various challenges to dismantle the policy. Last week, those challenges finally prevailed, as the court struck down race-conscious admissions, ruling them unconstitutional. Breaking away from decades of precedent, the chief justice, John Roberts, wrote in his opinion that universities had “concluded, wrongly, that the touchstone of an individual’s identity is not challenges bested, skills built, or lessons learned but the color of their skin. Our constitutional history does not tolerate that choice.”</p><p>I spoke to several civil rights advocates who are now hoping to curtail the fallout from the supreme court’s decision. Some noted what they saw as a loophole: the court didn’t explicitly rule out consideration of a student’s race in all situations. Roberts’ statement continued: “Nothing in this opinion should be construed as prohibiting universities from considering an applicant’s discussion of how race affected his or her life, be it through discrimination, inspiration or otherwise.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/jul/05/how-civil-rights-activists-are-preparing-for-a-post-affirmative-action-college-landscape">Continue reading...</a>

## Door Mouse review – strip club thriller that’s Raymond Chandler by way of Tank Girl

<p>Played by Hayley Law, Mouse is a graphic artist and burlesque performer who takes a predictable but well-drawn route through the mean streets</p><p>Part noir thriller and part punky comic-book subcult story, this Canadian-made debut from writer-director Avan Jogia is a bit hit and miss but impressive all the same. Credit is due as much to lead Hayley Law, better known as a recording artist, who has a knack for deadpan line delivery and a tremendous screen presence.</p><p>Law plays Mouse, a young graphic artist who draws pornographic stories for a very niche indie comic book market. It’s not making her a lot of money so she also performs in a shady burlesque-strip club run by strict but protective matriarch Mama (Famke Janssen, adding some serious horsepower to the ensemble). Mouse has a weird platonic bond with Ugly (Keith Powers), whose name is an obvious misnomer. He follows her around all the time and is almost ignored by everyone else, to the point where I was expecting his function to be a Fight Club-style projection device, but it turns out he is real.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/05/door-mouse-review-strip-club-thriller-thats-raymond-chandler-by-way-of-tank-girl">Continue reading...</a>
