  <p id="SGCq2b">The Sphere, aka the 366-foot-tall orb situated in the heart of Las Vegas, demonstrated what 1.2 million lit-up LEDs look like. During its first display on Tuesday night, animations showing fireworks, the American flag, the Moon, and even a giant blinking eyeball emanated from the 580,000-square-foot panel.</p>
<p id="PhplfL">Las Vegas is known for some pretty wild landmarks, but this one is more than just a humongous display-on-a-ball. On the inside, it’s a spherical theater <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/tourism/sphere-president-worlds-first-16k-led-screen-164k-speakers-feel-and-smell-await-audiences-2717285/">that houses 18,000 seats, along with a 16K wraparound LED screen</a>.

  <p id="ZYQFWk">Threads, the Twitter competitor created by Meta, has finally arrived after months of rumors, leaks, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/21/23769263/mark-zuckerberg-elon-musk-fight-cage-match-worldstar">a billionaire cage fight challenge</a> between Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk. Now you can access the new platform from its desktop site <a href="https://www.threads.net/">at Threads.net</a> or by downloading the app for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/threads-an-instagram-app/id6446901002">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instagram.barcelona&amp;gl=it">Android</a>.</p>
<p id="qTc6GW">On Threads, you can create text-based posts with up to 500 characters, as well as share photos and videos up to five minutes long. The app looks relatively similar to Twitter, featuring a minimal interface with the options to like, comment, repost, and share threads. Since Threads is closely tied to Instagram, you can log in with your Instagram username and easily follow all the same people you follow on the other platform. </p>

<p id="2rsCMj">This latest lawsuit is part of a host of litigation between Twitter and many of the thousands of employees it abruptly fired when Elon Musk took over last year.
