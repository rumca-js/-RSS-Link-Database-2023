After the Consumer Markets Authority blocked it in the UK, the Federal Trade Commission filed an injunction to halt the deal in the United States.\n\nThe FTC went on trial with Microsoft recently, and depending on the decision, the deal could be history. However, there have been some interesting new details revealed from the proceedings. Have you ever wondered if Microsoft planned to acquire other publishers? Or how much did Horizon Forbidden West cost Sony?\n\nSuch details and more were revealed during the trial, so without further ado, let's look at some of the spicier bits.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiOu-nAp1qI", "date_published": "2023-07-05T13:30:09+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "The Callisto Protocol: Final Transmission DLC Review - Still Underwhelming", "description": "The Callisto Protocol had several issues at launch, but perhaps the biggest was the lackluster ending. Final Transmission attempts to address that, providing a conclusion (of sorts) to Jacob's journey. The results are mixed, whether it's the lack of any substantially new threats and weapons or the same clunky combat and camera issues that affected the base game.\n\nThe visuals and sound design are well-done, and a few interesting new sequences (like the hallucinations) await. However, despite so much potential, Final Transmission is mediocre. Whether you'd like a proper conclusion or just some new content, it doesn't warrant being separate from the base game.\n\nCheck out our review of The Callisto Protocol: Final Transmission and what makes it so underwhelming.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kelstLvtqOw", "date_published": "2023-07-05T11:15:03+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
