Add a dramatic retelling with the goal of creating a compelling story out of it, and it feels impossible. And yet, “Sound of Freedom” manages that and more.</p><p>The film tells the story of Tim Ballard, former Homeland Security agent and founder of Operation Underground Railroad. While he's the main character, the film isn’t about him. It’s about the kids.</p><p>The film's opening sequence is as chilling as it is powerful. In it, sex trafficker Gisselle convinces a single father to bring his two children to “auditions" for an entertainment company. He drops his children off at a hotel room where other children are also waiting. Giselle tells him to return later to pick them up, but when he returns, all the children and Gisselle are gone, leaving only a dark, empty room.</p><p>The film then introduces Special Agent Tim Ballard, who is in the middle of an investigation into child sex crimes. In the course of this investigation, Ballard and his team apprehend a trafficker and rescue the young boy from the opening sequence. This rescue launches the rest of the story into action-thriller territory as Ballard works to save the boy’s sister and dozens of other children in the process.</p><p>Jim Caviezel delivers an emotional, yet understated performance as Tim Ballard. The feelings he shows on screen are all the more compelling for their subtlety. Because of this subtlety, the film's resolution feels earned rather than inevitable.</p><p>All that said, this is not a movie for the faint of heart. It is a movie about worldwide child sex trafficking. It never once shies away from its subject matter. And while it isn't graphic, the audience is under no illusions about what is going on behind the curtain. <br />None of this is meant to dismay the audience. Rather, it is used as a rallying cry to encourage people to raise the alarm. There are more slaves than ever in the history of the world, millions of them children, and we can fight back. Organizations like Operation Underground Railroad lead the charge, but they need support. Support they can’t get if people remain blind, something this film aims to rectify.</p><p>With a budget of $14.5 million, this film managed to tell a more poignant story than films with ten times its budget. It earned $10 million in presales alone and has an 85% critic and 99% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and an 8.6/10 on IMDb as of now.</p><p>“Sound of Freedom” has a genuine core of righteousness that most call-to-action films do not. This is a dramatic film, but it takes pains to show that real children need help now. And it does all this while giving us more of a heartfelt story than Hollywood has in years.</p><p>Watch the trailer for “Sound of Freedom” here:<br /></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

## KJP gives terrible response to Joe Biden's refusal to acknowledge Hunter's love child with a stripper as his granddaughter

It's usually in the context of letting them chop off their genitals or letting them get indoctrinated by teachers' union members. However, there is one child he refuses to acknowledge. A four-year-old Arkansas girl who has <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/hunter-biden-prositutes-union" target="_blank">a former stripper</a> for a mom, and deadbeat for a dad, and Joe Biden as her Paw Paw.</p><p>President Biden refuses to acknowledge the girl's existence, even as Hunter Biden (her dad) is parting in public more at the White House with his other kid. Karine Jean Pierre was finally asked about Biden's refusal to acknowledge this girl exists like he does all of his other grandchildren. Biden's <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kjp-assault-weapons" target="_blank">worst diversity hire gave one of her trademark answers</a> by refusing to answer, then rushing to change the topic.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>
<p>The reason this is in the news now is because of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/01/us/politics/hunter-biden-daughter-arkansas.html" target="_blank">a recent New York Times article</a> about money, corrosive politics, and what it means to have -- this is their words -- "the Biden birthright."</p><p>NYT told a tale of a little girl who loves playing with her cousins, is learning to ride a bike, and one day wants to learn to hunt like her mom. Then came two of the most heartbreaking sentences I think I've read in politics.</p><blockquote>The girl is aware that her father is Hunter Biden and that her paternal grandfather is the president of the United States. She speaks about both of them often, but she has not met them.</blockquote><p>This is the granddaughter who Hunter Biden fought to PREVENT using the Biden last name. He and his baby mama "settled the matter" and the girl will go by her mother's last name. NYT made it a point to report there is "no evidence" the White House is involved in those actions.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>You know the game, right? Imagine it was Eric Trump who had a love child with a stripper, Donald Trump denied the granddaughter existed, and at least Eric FOUGHT to prevent the daughter from having his last name. We all know what would be said about Trump, or any other Republican, in that instance, right?</p><p>Joe Biden is a scumbag.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Affirmative Action and the Supreme Court’s “unprecedented” week
 - [https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/affirmative-action-supreme-court](https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/affirmative-action-supreme-court)

<img src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=34282320&amp;width=1200&amp;height=800&amp;coordinates=252%2C0%2C0%2C0" /><br /><br /><p>The MSM has described the last week at the Supreme Court as “<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-decisions-on-affirmative-action-student-loan-forgiveness-same-sex-discrimination/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unprecedented</a>.”</p>
<p>Let’s see.</p>
<p>Part of this “unprecedented” week involved <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/supreme-court-affirmative-action" target="_blank">a ruling on Affirmative Action</a>. On June 29, 2023, the Supreme Court of the United States declared <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/20-1199_hgdj.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Affirmative Action in college admissions unconstitutional</a>. Predictably, the left’s response was to whine, whinge and moan. </p>
<p>To the left, Affirmative Action is a “<em>victory for minorities, and for </em><em>social justice,</em><em> and for higher education.</em>” You probably think this is something the left recently said while reeeeee-ing in response to the banning of systemic racism in school admissions. In fact, that quote <a href="https://youtu.be/i90CjqctLeI" target="_blank">is from 1978 by the President of the University of California</a>.</p>
<p>Sound familiar? While the left’s linguistic alchemy is nothing new, neither is their ability to perpetually whine. Even when SCOTUS ruled in favor of race-based admissions in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke (1978), predictably, the left’s response was that the decision did not go far enough. Here’s how students reacted to the decision in 1978. Sharon Jackson, a medical student at the University of California in 1978 stated in response to the decision:</p><blockquote><span></span><em>"The question arises, if it took you 200 years to build a house and someone came along and with a match to burn that house down, how would you feel about that person?"</em></blockquote><p><em></em>In case you were wondering, the students were complaining that even though SCOTUS ruled in favor of Affirmative Action, it did not uphold racial quotas in that 1978 ruling. Trying to satisfy a leftist was as pointless then as it is now.</p>
<p>But while the left’s decades-long culture war talking points haven’t changed, neither has America’s opposition towards Affirmative Action <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/7660/gallup-brain-bakke-affirmative-action.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">from the 70s</a> to now where <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/americans-approve-supreme-court-decision-restricting-race-college/story?id=100580375&amp;cid=social_twitter_tw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">52% of Americans approve of the SCOTUS decision</a>, compared to 32% that disapprove.</p>
<p>So what does all this mean? It means that contrary to the mainstream narrative, we are not living in “unprecedented” times. </p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DNfWVpDA08_Od6Rqm2H2_G_G6taXxsV6LHNg3vylke_2Y4mlSdccpUu6fO_UhYuqtRJfWR9H6w1Btc-R6tuZ7eGLXVNiO_NNnY-Hd4zioE6XrtiZjPA6-98hJExOKjsFqQqt_Mj_02kMyv7hfshQoTc" /></p>
<p>Today is just another chapter in the perpetual American culture war. Today is also another chapter in SCOTUS righting one more wrong, as it has many times before. See segregation, abortion, concealed-carry, religious freedom, etc</p>
<p>And tomorrow will be more of the same.</p>
<p>Tomorrow the left will try to find a way to work around this decision. How do we know? </p><p>The College Board, the organization that’s responsible for standardized tests, <a href="https://allaccess.collegeboard.org/admissions-test-provider-organizations-join-inform-us-supreme-court-arguments" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">filed an opposition brief to the Supreme Court on these cases</a>. The College Board’s current CEO is David Coleman. You may also recognize him <a href="https://www.edweek.org/education/opinion-straight-up-conversation-common-core-architect-and-new-college-board-president-david-coleman/2012/06" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">as “The Architect of Common Core.”</a></p><p>Harvard was<a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2023/06/harvard-united-in-resolve-in-face-of-supreme-courts-admissions-ruling/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> also nice enough to tell us it will do so as well</a>.</p>
<p>And what will we do tomorrow? Predictably, hold the line and stand in their way. Stay white-pilled and fight like hell! </p>

## Watch: Bud Light attempts desperate return to "fratty" humor with Super Bowl champion who's not allowed to drink beer

This is where people sit in a room and throw spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks. Possibly while high. The former #1beer in America's latest (failed) attempt to avoid apologizing to their now former customers stars Kansas City Chief tight end <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/travis-kelce-pardon-my-take" target="_blank">Travis Kelce</a>.</p><p>In a commercial where Kelce doesn't drink the beer.

</blockquote>
<p>To illustrate how cool and refreshing Bud Light is, they hired an athlete who can't drink beer. Not that he's on the wagon or anything. NFL Players, per their union contract, are <a href="https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2023/06/15/patrick-mahomes-coors-light-bear-commercial#:~:text=The%20Chiefs%20superstar%20quarterback%2C%20like,ads%20only%20beginning%20in%202019." target="_blank">not allowed to appear in commercials or advertisements drinking beer or directly endorsing a beer</a>. Also, let's be honest, how many people outside of Kansas City recognize Kelce when he isn't in uniform?</p><p>The bigger problem goes back to something I keep saying. I know the deal with <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-rogan-dylan-mulvaney" target="_blank">controversial titface performer Dylan Mulvaney</a> is the easier target. The bigger problem that caused Bud Light's collapse is when <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-exec-bear-market" target="_blank">disgraced former vice president Alissa Heinerscheid</a> exposed how little the people who run Anheuser-Busch think about the people who (up until recently) drank AB products.</p><blockquote>Bud Light had been kind of a brand of fratty, kind of out-of-touch humor, and it was really important that we had another approach.</blockquote><p>That another approach didn't work, so they are going back to "fratty" and "out-of-touch" humor. Only now that fratty and out-of-touch humor comes across as a cheap pander. These campaigns don't come from a place of comedy. They come from a place of "this is how little elite executives think of middle America."</p><p>I'll bet you a free case of Bud Light after rebate that the company's new deal with the WWE isn't in recognition of them being the recognized symbol of excellence in sports entertainment. It's because someone in a boardroom figured rubes like their rasslin'.</p><p>A simple "whoops, we f*cked up" twenty billion dollars ago could have worked. Bud Light instead went in eleventy different directions.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Federal judge blocks Biden Admin from coordinating with Big Tech to suppress content in huge win for free speech

The injunction comes from a lawsuit brought by the Missouri and Louisiana Attorney Generals claiming the White House went too far in coordinating with Big Tech companies to censor content about the schmandemic and the 2020 schmelection.</p><p>In his ruling, <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.lawd.189520/gov.uscourts.lawd.189520.293.0.pdf" target="_blank">federal Judge Terry Doughty says the plaintiffs</a> have a strong likelihood of proving the US government supressed dissent -- dissent that all went in one direction -- and has ordered the admin and federal agencies to cease communication with Big Tech companies.</p><blockquote> Opposition to COVID-19 vaccines; opposition to COVID-19 masking and lockdowns; opposition to the lab-leak theory of COVID-19; opposition to the validity of the 2020 election; opposition to President Biden’s policies; statements that the Hunter Biden laptop story was true; and opposition to policies of the government officials in power. All were suppressed.</blockquote><p>If you are like me and get confused with legal mumbo jumbo, the way these bars <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/04/biden-social-lawsuit-missouri-louisiana/" target="_blank">are framed by corporate journalisming creators</a> -- who support the Biden Admin suppressing opposing viewpoints -- shows that it is a win for free speech.</p><blockquote>The Donald Trump-appointed judge's move could undo years of efforts to enhance coordination between the government and social media companies.</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

Any post they deem disinformation. In what I'm sure is merely an ironic coincidence, this website saw traffic to any post making fun of Joe Biden get throttled. Either that or a Facebook audience of over 3 million rabid conservatives all decided at the same time they no longer enjoyed sh*tting on Biden.</p><p>When I say "big win" it is A SINGLE big win in a longer war.

The man who critics say got away with murder after stabbing his ex-wife to death in the mid-90s -- independent fact-checkers will say he was found not guilty -- will cut it up on Twitter and occasionally take a stab at commenting on the news of the day. Over the weekend, he sliced up Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.</p><p>Liberals have decided that Thomas, the one black conservative justice, is to blame for every decision they don't like when there are five perfectly good white conservative justices to choose from. That's when leftists aren't <a href="https://twitter.com/soledadobrien/status/1675098803014184961" target="_blank">launching racist attacks</a> against our <a href="https://twitter.com/jemelehill/status/1675203147504005121" target="_blank">Asian brothers and sisters</a>. Simpson is no different. But in a discussion about the greatest athlete ever?</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>"If you took screwing as an athletic achievement, then I think Clarence Thomas would be the greatest athlete of all-time because he’s screwed – I’m an African American – he has screwed more people than anybody if you ask me."</p><p>The Supreme Court was on a roll this week, where the conservative majority came down on the right side of history <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/supreme-court-affirmative-action" target="_blank">with equality</a>, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/boston-university-law-supreme-court" target="_blank">free speech</a>, and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-walks-away-msnbc" target="_blank">Joe Biden's unconstitutional student loan bailout</a>. They were consequential decisions made by consequential people for consequential times. As for the inconsequential OJ spitting bars about Clarence Thomas, I feel it unnecessary to take him any more seriously than Justice Thomas takes him.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Instead, here are some cheap jokes about Simpson (allegedly) getting away with murder (according to critics).</p><p><br /></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">No other way to slice it up.

<p>I'm sure I speak for all of America when I say if there's one thing We the People need now, it's a video of OJ Simpson skewering Hunter Biden. If OJ is looking to penetrate into the news of the day, he needs to impale Hunter either over them finding cocaine in the White House, or he needs to stick Joe Biden for denying is youngest granddaughter.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
