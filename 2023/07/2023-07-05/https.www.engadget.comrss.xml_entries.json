The early start time is due to the fact Samsung plans to host the showcase from its home base of Seoul, South Korea. When Samsung first <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-will-focus-on-foldables-in-its-upcoming-july-unpacked-event-064922443.html\"><ins>began teasing Unpacked</ins></a> last month, it promised the event would feature its latest generation of foldable devices. In other words, expect new iterations of the Galaxy Z Fold and Galaxy Z Flip. Thanks to pre-release leaks, we have a pretty good idea of what Samsung has planned for those devices. In the case of the former, all signs point to a refined hinge mechanism that allows the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/15/23762037/galaxy-z-fold-5-leak-hinge-flat-foldable\"><ins>Z Fold 5</ins></a> to close flat, while the most significant change with the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/leaked-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-render-shows-a-bigger-cover-display-214020400.html\"><ins>Z Flip 5</ins></a> looks to be a larger front-facing cover display.</p><p>Ahead of the 26th, Samsung is offering a $50 reservation credit for those who decide they want to pre-order the Galaxy Z Fold 5 or Galaxy Z Flip 5 sight unseen.

Mark Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/pfbid02BJtNMVwGCdbXBDEvcPkgN1Dz6oru7qSiP2BScMGShDExxxLnLYpUhJYUsZJP2v8Vl\">announced</a> the new service one day ahead of the July 6th launch date that appeared <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/metas-instagram-linked-twitter-rival-threads-could-arrive-on-july-6th-063129168.html\">in app stores</a> earlier this week. Meta has begun rolling out the new service around the world, though it won\u2019t be available within the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/metas-twitter-rival-threads-wont-initially-launch-in-the-eu-090314803.html\">European Union</a> until the company addresses potential regulatory concerns.</p><p>In a blog post announcing the Twitter rival, the company described Threads as a \u201cseparate space for real-time updates and public conversations\u201d that relies on users\u2019 Instagram credentials but will eventually be compatible with a wider swath of decentralized services like Mastodon. For now though, Threads users log into the app and <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/\">website</a> with their existing Instagram account. The company will \u201ccarry over\u201d existing usernames and verification status to Threads, though users have the option to further customize their profiles.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Like on Instagram, the company will rely heavily on recommendations to help people discover new accounts to follow. And Meta has been <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1676514177102258176\">quietly testing</a> the service with a small group of celebrities and creators, as well as its own employees, so new users won\u2019t be greeted with an empty social network.</p><p>The service itself looks remarkably similar to Twitter though its design will feel familiar to Instagram users. It supports text posts up to 500 characters, as well as photos and videos up to five minutes. Threads will also support reposts \u2014 its version of a retweet \u2014 as well as quote posts. Users can also limit their replies, block and report other users. And posts from Threads can be easily shared to users\u2019 Instagram Story for added visibility.</p><figure><img alt=\"Meta's threads app looks similar to twitter,\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/dd9979c0-1b84-11ee-bfbf-1fec7fec1191\" style=\"height: 1280px; width: 1920px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Meta</div></figure><p>The launch comes at a particularly chaotic moment for Twitter, just days after Elon Musk announced strict <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-puts-strict-cap-on-how-many-tweets-users-can-read-each-day-182623928.html\">rate limits</a> that severely restricted the number of posts many users could view on the platform. The company also <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-isnt-showing-tweets-unless-youre-logged-in-165254006.html\">stopped</a> showing tweets to logged-out users, before quietly <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-quietly-backtracks-on-requiring-users-to-log-in-to-see-tweets-135230558.html\">backtracking</a>. Musk, who has complained about AI companies training their platforms on Twitter data, blamed both unpopular moves on \u201cdata scraping.\u201d</p><p>With Threads, Meta is challenging not just Twitter but the growing wave of Twitter <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-alternatives-mastodon-223221883.html\">alternatives </a>like Mastodon. The company is planning to make Threads compatible with ActivityPub, the open source protocol that powers Mastodon and other decentralized services sometimes collectively referred to as the <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/11/leaving-twitters-walled-garden\">\u201cFediverse.\u201d</a></p><p>\u201cOur plan is to work with ActivityPub to provide you the option to stop using Threads and transfer your content to another service,\u201d the company wrote in a blog post. \u201cOur vision is that people using compatible apps will be able to follow and interact with people on Threads without having a Threads account, and vice versa, ushering in a new era of diverse and interconnected networks.\u201d</p><p>As Meta explains, this means that users from Mastodon and other services that support ActivityPub will be able to follow and interact with public-facing posts on Threads. (Private accounts on threads will still be able to manually approve new followers from other services.) And other developers could one day create their own Threads-compatible features and services.</p><p>For now, it\u2019s not clear how long it will take for Meta to fully integrate ActivityPub into Threads. In an early post on the service that was <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/metas-threads-is-already-showing-conversations-on-the-web-120453471.html\">briefly viewable</a> ahead of its official launch, Instagram head Adam Mosseri said the company was \u201ccommitted\u201d to the protocol, but didn\u2019t provide a timeline. It\u2019s also not clear how ActivityPub integration could affect content moderation and other safety issues. While Meta\u2019s Threads app has the same content moderation policies as Instagram, services built by other developers are able to set their own standards and policies just as different instances on Mastodon have their own guidelines and norms. Meta notes that this will give users \u201cthe freedom to choose spaces that align with their values.\u201d</p><p>At the moment, the biggest question facing Threads, though, is whether it has a chance at becoming a viable Twitter alternative. Since Musk took over the company last year, Twitter users have flocked to alternative platforms like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-client-developers-fleeing-twitter-mastodon-130031551.html\">Mastodon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/jack-dorsey-backed-bluesky-is-having-a-moment-133039184.html\">Bluesky</a>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/a-new-twitter-alternative-is-trying-to-lure-users-about-to-lose-their-old-checkmark-160011153.html\">T2</a>, and others. But so far none have achieved anything close to the scale of Twitter, much less Meta. But, with more than 1 billion Instagram users, Zuckerberg and Meta are clearly hoping that they can gather momentum much more quickly than other decentralized upstarts.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/metas-threads-app-is-here-to-challenge-twitter-230039730.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/metas-threads-app-is-here-to-challenge-twitter-230039730.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-05T23:00:39+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "OpenAI is forming a team to rein in superintelligent AI", "description": "<p>OpenAI is <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/introducing-superalignment\">forming a dedicated team</a> to manage the risks of superintelligent artificial intelligence. A superintelligence is a hypothetical AI model that is smarter than even the most gifted and intelligent human, and excels at multiple areas of expertise instead of one domain like some previous generation models. OpenAI believes such a model could arrive before the end of the decade. \u201cSuperintelligence will be the most impactful technology humanity has ever invented, and could help us solve many of the world\u2019s most important problems,\u201d the non-profit said. \u201cBut the vast power of superintelligence could also be very dangerous, and could lead to the disempowerment of humanity or even human extinction.\u201d</p><p>The new team will be co-lead by OpenAI Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever and Jan Leike, the research lab's head of alignment. Additionally, OpenAI said it would dedicate 20 percent of its currently secured compute power to the initiative, with the goal of developing an <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/our-approach-to-alignment-research\"><ins>automated alignment researcher</ins></a>. Such a system would theoretically assist OpenAI in ensuring a superintelligence is safe to use and aligned with human values. \u201cWhile this is an incredibly ambitious goal and we\u2019re not guaranteed to succeed, we are optimistic that a focused, concerted effort can solve this problem,\u201d OpenAI said. \u201cThere are many ideas that have shown promise in preliminary experiments, we have increasingly useful metrics for progress, and we can use today\u2019s models to study many of these problems empirically.\u201d The lab added it would share a roadmap in the future.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Wednesday\u2019s announcement comes as governments around the world consider how to regulate the nascent AI industry. In the US, Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, has <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-07-05/ai-congress-regulation-lobbying\"><ins>met with at least 100 federal lawmakers</ins></a> in recent months. Publicly, Altman has said AI regulation is \u201cessential,\u201d and that OpenAI is \u201ceager\u201d to work with policymakers. But we should be skeptical of such proclamations, and indeed efforts like OpenAI\u2019s Superalignment team. By focusing the attention of the public on hypothetical risks that may never materialize, organizations like OpenAI shift the burden of regulation to the horizon instead of the here and now.

Due to Apple taking 30 percent of in-app purchases, Spotify users who were subscribed through in-app purchases were being charged an extra $3 per month compared to subscribing through Spotify directly.

Apple said in a regulatory filing from 2019 that it collected that 15 percent fee <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/apple-spotify-fees-subscribers-app-store-tax-complaint-1203251621/\"><ins>on roughly 680,000 Spotify customers</ins></a>.

The new mid-range model jumps to a 6.7-inch, 120Hz 2,772 x 1,240 screen, promising a big boost over the 6.4-inch, 90Hz 1080p panel from its predecessor. You'll also get 80W wired fast charging the company claims can deliver a 60 percent charge in 15 minutes.</p><p>The OnePlus Nord 3 also makes the leap to a MediaTek Dimensity 9000 chip (versus the 2T's Dimensity 1300), and it now comes with up to 16GB of RAM instead of last year's 12GB. The battery is larger, too, at 5,000mAh versus 4,500mAh. The device's 50MP primary camera is the same as on the higher-end <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-11-review-price-release-date-cameras-150015371.html\">OnePlus 11</a>. That won't beat the absolute best cameras on the market, but it's more compelling in this price class. You can also expect an 8MP ultra-wide camera, a 2MP macro sensor and a 16MP front cam.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Software support is stronger this time around. OnePlus now promises three years of major OS updates for the Nord 3 compared to just two for the 2T. You'll also receive four years of security fixes. That's not as extensive as for the OnePlus 11 or rivals like Samsung, but it still means your phone will likely remain up to date until you're ready to replace it.</p><p>OnePlus is taking Nord 3 pre-orders today, starting at \u20ac449 ($488) for 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Pay \u20ac549 ($597) and you'll get 16GB of RAM alongside 256GB of storage. At the moment, though, it's only poised to reach 16 European Union countries as well as key markets like India. It's not surprising that OnePlus won't release the phone in the US (the company only offers its entry <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-nord-n300-5g-t-mobile-130023383.html\">Nord N-series</a> stateside), but it's also not coming to the UK as of this writing. A spokesperson <a href=\"https://www.techadvisor.com/article/1975573/exclusive-oneplus-nord-3-will-not-be-sold-in-uk.html\">told</a><em>Tech Advisor</em> last week that \"logistical challenges\" with customs prevented it from offering the Nord 3 and other phones online. You may still see a UK debut, but not in the immediate future.</p><p>Whether or not it's a good buy versus the Google <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-7a-review-its-got-everything-you-need-and-more-for-just-499-184517525.html\">Pixel 7a</a> or Samsung <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-a54-galaxy-a34-hands-on-pricing-release-date-090009335.html\">Galaxy A54</a> depends on your priorities. OnePlus is offering some of the best display, camera hardware and memory in this category, but Google typically produces better real-world photos and offers a 'pure' Android interface with timelier upgrades. Samsung, meanwhile, offers better secondary cameras than OnePlus, more updates and tight integration with its ecosystem.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-nord-3-delivers-a-120hz-screen-and-80w-fast-charging-161505940.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-nord-3-delivers-a-120hz-screen-and-80w-fast-charging-161505940.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-05T16:15:05+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The modular Fairphone 4 arrives in the US for the first time", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/fairphone/\"><ins>Fairphone</ins></a> is at long last bringing its sustainability-focused smartphones <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Fairphone/status/1676581724543754241\"><ins>to the US</ins></a>. The company has teamed up with Murena to start offering <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/fairphone-4-5g-preview-103011717.html\"><ins>a version of the Fairphone 4</ins></a> in the country. The Murena Fairphone 4 is available to order now. It starts at $599 for 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, according to <a href=\"https://murena.com/america/shop/smartphones/brand-new/murena-fairphone-4/\"><ins>the Murena store</ins></a>. A variant with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage will run you $679. Storage is expandable via microSD.</p><p>Those prices might seem fairly steep for a two-year old device with <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-750-global-5g-ai-echo-cancellation-133000558.html\"><ins>a mid-range Qualcomm chip from 2020</ins></a>, but the Murena Fairphone 4 is about much more than the pure specs. For one thing, it's a privacy-centric device with a version of Android that's detangled from Google. Murena's /e/ operating system eschews Google's stock apps. For instance, rather than Google Maps, you'll get an open-source alternative by default. The device has its own directory that gives each app a privacy rating. As such, you'll have some information about how each app tracks your data before you install one.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>You can still install Google-built apps. Murena <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/5/23783714/murena-fairphone-4-us-release-date-price-sustainability-repair\"><ins>purports</ins></a> to snag apps from the Play Store without directing your information to Google. You can install a standard version of Android if you like, but Murena warns that this will void your warranty. (For what it's worth, Fairphone 4 buyers in Europe can opt to have either stock Android or /e/ out of the box). Murena plans to provide software updates and security patches for at least five years, while Fairphone offers a five-year hardware warranty.</p><p>Fairphone's ethos centers around repairability and as such the smartphone is designed to be long-lasting. The Fairphone 4 has a 10 out of 10 repairability score <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/News/55818/fairphone-4-teardown-if-only-apple-made-phones-like-this\"><ins>from iFixit</ins></a>. It has a modular design and it's said to be the first such phone with an IP rating of IP54. That means the phone should be protected from dust and rain. None of the components are glued together and you can use a regular screwdriver to swap them out.</p><p>The Murena Fairphone 4 has a 3905mAh battery as well as 5G and dual-SIM support. On the camera front, you'll get a dual 48MP rear camera and 25MP selfie camera. The device's body, camera array, loudspeaker, USB-C port and 6.3-inch display <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/fairphone-is-coming-to-america/\"><ins>are all individual parts</ins></a> and you'll be able to buy replacements from Murena. Meanwhile, the Murena Fairphone 4 doesn't come with a USB cable, power adapter or headphones in the box. Murena sells those separately as it encourages buyers to use cables and adapters they might already have stuffed in a drawer somewhere.</p><p>Although the device is unlocked, T-Mobile and mobile virtual network operators that use the T-Mobile network are the only recommended carriers for it in the US. Fairphone is framing the device's US debut as a pilot as the company is primarily focused on the European market. &quot;This collaboration with e/OS/ is a great opportunity for us to pilot selling devices in the US market with a long-standing partner and learn more about the American market,&quot; Fairphone CEO Eva Gouwens told Engadget in a statement.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-modular-fairphone-4-arrives-in-the-us-for-the-first-time-155721165.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/the-modular-fairphone-4-arrives-in-the-us-for-the-first-time-155721165.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-05T15:57:21+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Amazon's Echo Dot drops to an all-time low of $23 in early Prime Day deal", "description": "<p>Amazon Prime Day is upon us, and with it comes great deals on many of our favorite smart home devices, including already well-priced speakers.

The new controller, based on the Neo Geo CD controller released in 1994, supports Bluetooth and 2.4 GHz wireless and is compatible with Windows and Android as well as the significantly less common <a href=\"https://www.snk-corp.co.jp/us/neogeomini/\">Neo Geo Mini series</a>. The controller lasts 35 hours wirelessly and will take one hour to charge. You can optionally plug the controller into your device to eliminate any sort of latency or interference.</p><p>The officially-licensed NSK controller also features L/R shoulder buttons, button layout swapping and a turbo function to help with compatibility across a wide range of games and platforms.

With its wide platform support, it\u2019s a great companion for those who are constantly gaming on the go, though Apple fans will be left out for starters. 8BitDo <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/8bitdo-controllers-now-work-with-apple-devices-163657954.html\">announced earlier this year</a> that all of its controllers now support iPhones, iPads and Macs.

In early 2022, the company released its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/8-bitdo-ultimate-wired-controller-170545714.html\">Ultimate Wired Controller</a>, which included Xbox-specific face buttons, haptic feedback and a built-in headphone jack.</p><p>The 8BitDo Neo Geo CD will be available in four limited edition color options in addition to the standard black.

Now that it uses the E-Tron moniker as a label for all of its EVs, the carmaker has rebadged the updated E-Tron as the Q8 E-Tron. Yet this is more than just a facelift. Instead, Audi took the opportunity to make the vehicle better based on what it's learned over the past few years as an EV builder.</p><p>The biggest difference from the offset is the increased range. The previous E-Tron had a range of 204 miles at launch. This new Q8 E-Tron manages a more impressive 285 miles on a single charge, which should appease most people looking to buy an EV.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Behind the wheel, the new Audi is just a better driving vehicle than the original E-Tron. It's less performance-centric than you would expect from a brand like Audi, instead the automaker has targeted a luxury ride and frankly, it's nailed it. It's a good example of automakers taking what they've learned while building EVs over the past few years and evolving their platform.

Their little round earpieces are light and evenly balanced, so they shouldn\u2019t be a pain for most to wear for hours at a time. The default sound profile is good enough: It\u2019s warm, with a bump in the upper-bass and a dip in the treble that can dull some finer details but sounds pleasant on the whole. Unlike many cheaper headphones, it doesn\u2019t completely blow out the low-end. As with many modern pairs, you can tweak the sound with custom EQ tools in the Soundcore app. Using these won\u2019t make the Space A40 sound as nice as the best premium pairs, but it can give them a touch more deep bass or high-frequency emphasis. The app in general is easy to use, and it saves any changes you make directly to the earphones.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The Space A40's best feature is their active noise cancellation (ANC), which is outstanding for the money. It won\u2019t totally block out higher-pitched sounds, but it\u2019s plenty effective at muting the rumbles of a train or jet engine. By default, Anker uses an adaptive ANC system that automatically tweaks the intensity based on your surroundings, though you can manually set it to strong, moderate or weak levels, too. That\u2019s great for those with sensitive ears. There\u2019s also a transparency mode, which isn\u2019t nearly as good as what you\u2019d find on a high-end pair like the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/airpods-pro-review-second-generation-130048218.html\">AirPods Pro</a> but works in a pinch.</p><p>Most of the little touches you\u2019d want from a modern set of headphones are here as well. The Space A40 can connect to two devices simultaneously, and you can use one earbud on its own. Battery life is solid at eight-ish hours per charge, while the included case can supply another 40 or so hours and supports wireless charging. The IPX4 water resistance rating isn\u2019t anything special but still means the earphones can survive light rain and everyday sweat. The touch control scheme can feel somewhat busy, as it lets you assign up to six different shortcuts to different taps and long presses and effectively forces you to omit a function or two, but it works reliably. We\u2019ve had no real connection issues, either.</p><p>The only major shortcomings are the mic quality and the lack of auto-pausing when you remove an earbud. The former doesn\u2019t handle sibilant sounds very well and can lose your voice in particularly noisy areas, so this isn\u2019t the best option for phone calls, but it\u2019s usable.</p><p>Bluetooth: v5.2<br />Active noise cancellation: Yes<br />Transparency mode: Yes<br />Custom EQ: Yes<br />Charging port: USB-C<br />Wireless charging: Yes<br />Water resistance: IPX4<br />Multipoint connectivity: Yes (2 devices)<br />Auto-pause: No<br />Battery life (rated): 10 hrs, 50 hrs w/ case<br />Fast charging (rated): 10 mins = 4 hrs<br />Codecs: SBC, AAC, LDAC<br />Warranty: 18 months</p><h2>Runner up: EarFun Air Pro 3</h2><p></p><p>The $80 <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9FYXJGdW4tQWlyLVByby1DYW5jZWxsaW5nLU11bHRpcG9pbnQvZHAvQjBCTk5NWVNHUT90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby0xbXktMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImJmN2I2N2Y4LWU0MjEtNDQ1MC05NmRiLWQ5Y2RjMTcyOGM3YSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAWtxbryUICRZeUGXq-mBIgWJlonDfAi9Ek1SWkbh6dIy&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FEarFun-Air-Pro-Cancelling-Multipoint%2Fdp%2FB0BNNMYSGQ\">EarFun Air Pro 3</a> are a commendable alternative to the Space A40 if you see them on sale or if you prefer an AirPods-style \u201cstem\u201d design. Like the Space A40, they come with ANC, a transparency mode, a relatively stable fit, a pocketable case that supports Qi wireless charging and the ability to connect to two devices at once. Battery life is slightly worse, closer to six or seven hours than eight, but it\u2019s not bad. Their IPX5 water resistance rating is a touch better, as is their built-in mic.</p><p>The Air Pro 3 sounds decent, too. By default, they have an excited, V-shaped EQ curve, with intense bass and a noticeable spike in the treble. Some might enjoy this, as it gives EDM and pop a good sense of thump, but others might find it fatiguing, and it can make higher frequencies sound a hair too sharp. The Space A40\u2019s sound isn\u2019t exactly balanced, but it should be a little more agreeable for most. You can still rein in and personalize the sound with a (less flexible) custom EQ tool in the EarFun app, though.</p><p>Likewise, the Air Pro 3\u2019s active noise cancellation is serviceable in most cases, but it\u2019s a half-step behind the Space A40 and isn't customizable. Plus, while the design is generally comfortable for extended listening, it\u2019s bulkier than our top pick. On the plus side, the touch controls are slightly more extensive, as you can triple-tap each earbud to access additional shortcuts.</p><p>Bluetooth: v5.3<br />Active noise cancellation: Yes<br />Transparency mode: Yes<br />Custom EQ: Yes<br />Charging port: USB-C<br />Wireless charging: Yes<br />Water resistance: IPX5<br />Multipoint connectivity: Yes (2 devices)<br />Auto-pause: No<br />Battery life (rated): 9 hrs w/ ANC on, 7 hrs w/ ANC off, 45 hrs w/ case<br />Fast charging (rated): 10 mins = 2 hrs<br />Codecs: SBC, AAC, LC3, aptX adaptive<br />Warranty: 18 months</p><h2>Best under $50: EarFun Free 2S</h2><p></p><p>If you don\u2019t want to spend more than $50 on a set of true wireless earbuds, consider the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9FYXJGdW4tUXVhbGNvbW0lQzIlQUUtQmx1ZXRvb3RoLVN3ZWF0c2hpZWxkVE0tV2F0ZXJwcm9vZi9kcC9CMEJSVjVWTllNLz90aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTFteS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYmY3YjY3ZjgtZTQyMS00NDUwLTk2ZGItZDljZGMxNzI4YzdhIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAVNv4ShaTnef_bc2o_O52O__Ocd5WLycZ1YER7k48DV7&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FEarFun-Qualcomm%25C2%25AE-Bluetooth-SweatshieldTM-Waterproof%2Fdp%2FB0BRV5VNYM%2F%3Fth%3D1\">Earfun Free 2S</a>. Like the Air Pro 3, it has a big bass response and a smaller bump in the treble. It misses details in the mids and can get fatiguing over extended periods, but it\u2019s a richer example of this kind of \u201cfun\u201d sound signature than most pairs in this price range. You can adjust the sound through EarFun\u2019s app as well, though there\u2019s still fewer EQ presets to choose from than with the Soundcore Space A40.</p><p>The earpieces themselves are well-shaped and not oversized; combined with their soft silicone ear tips, they should be comfortable for most to wear over long periods of time. An IPX7 rating means they\u2019re fully waterproof, too. There\u2019s a suite of reliable touch controls and battery life sits at around seven hours. The included case adds another 30 or so hours and supports wireless charging, too. It\u2019s not the smallest case we\u2019ve used, but it\u2019s not so large that it can\u2019t fit in a pocket, either.</p><p>That said, you start to run into more \u201cyou get what you pay for\u201d situations once you drop into this price range. In addition to not sounding <em>quite</em> as sharp as our pricier picks, the Free 2S lack active noise cancellation, multi-device connectivity, auto-pausing and a transparency mode.

They\u2019re particularly useful for workouts, as their compact design should be snug yet comfortable for most. What\u2019s more, they don\u2019t require any bulky wing stabilizers or over-ear hooks. They also have an IP55 water resistance rating, which should be enough to withstand most gym sessions. (As with most earbuds, you should give them a light cleaning between workouts.) Plus, they use physical buttons instead of touch controls. When you\u2019re on the move, having that immediate, tactile feedback is more reliable for quickly changing tracks or adjusting volume.</p><p>The Elite 3 still sound better than most pairs in this price range, too. As noted <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-3-review-120031350.html\">in our review</a> the Elite 3\u2019s signature is balanced enough for most music, with a slight but not overbearing bass boost that gives tracks a nice sense of body. By default, it sounds a bit better than both the Space A40 and the Air Pro: The treble is more present than the former, and the bass is less boomy than the latter. It\u2019s more measured than the Free 2S as well, so if you see the Elite 3 on sale for around $50, it\u2019s the pair to get. Similar to our other top picks, you can also customize the Elite 3\u2019s EQ through the Jabra Sound+ app.</p><p>Where the Elite 3 falls short is in all the other stuff. There\u2019s no active noise cancellation, no wireless charging, no multipoint connectivity and no auto-pausing. And while there is a transparency mode, the effect is so meager that you\u2019re better off just removing the earpieces entirely. The seven-ish hours of battery life is solid, however, and you can use a single earbud at a time if needed. Call quality is acceptable as well, though not a standout feature.</p><p>You could also consider the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwQlRaVEZKUEo_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMW15LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiZjdiNjdmOC1lNDIxLTQ0NTAtOTZkYi1kOWNkYzE3MjhjN2EifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVqJFq75PNSeCB2nw_CfAr1b_77K9-kwd98I81yK-Kxa&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0BTZTFJPJ\">Elite 4</a>, which <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/jabras-elite-4-earbuds-forgo-a-few-niceties-for-a-20-price-cut-130037814.html\">launched in March</a><em>&nbsp;</em>and feature both ANC and multipoint connectivity.

(Like most open earbuds, though, comfort here is dependent on your ear shape.) Mic quality is more than adequate, and the circular touch panels give ample room for using the controls, which are customizable and consistently responsive. Battery life sits around<em>&nbsp;</em>five hours, which is middling but not out of character for budget earbuds.<em>&nbsp;</em>The pocket-friendly case adds about three full charges, but it\u2019s worth noting that Amazon doesn\u2019t include a USB-C charging cable. A poor IPX2 water resistance rating means you should avoid the gym, too.</p><p>While the Echo Buds sound fine out of the box, I'd use the EQ sliders in the Alexa app to bring down the treble a click or two. By default, the highs are a bit too edgy. That said, this emphasis lends a nice crispness to things like vocals, cymbals and strings, and there\u2019s enough separation to keep complex tracks from sounding totally muddled. The profile here isn\u2019t as full-bodied as <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-review-2021-160026883.html\">the latest AirPods</a>, and no open earbuds deliver true sub-bass, but there\u2019s at least some rumble for hip-hop and EDM.</p><p>Unlike many cheap earbuds, the Echo Buds support auto-pausing and multipoint. I often had to manually pause playback on one device before I could switch to the other, but having the feature at all at this price is great. Unsurprisingly, they also come with Alexa baked in, which you can access hands-free. You manage the Echo Buds through the Alexa app, which is much more cluttered than a dedicated audio app but includes extras like a lost device tracker and sidetone control for phone calls. And if you want nothing to do with Alexa, it also lets you turn off the mics and wake-word support.</p><p>Bluetooth: v5.2<br />Active noise cancellation: No<br />Transparency mode: No<br />Custom EQ: Yes<br />Charging port: USB-C<br />Wireless charging: No<br />Water resistance: IPX2<br />Multipoint connectivity: Yes (2 devices)<br />Auto-pause: Yes<br />Battery life (rated): 5 hrs, 6 hrs w/ wake word off, 20 hrs w/ case<br />Fast charging: 15 mins = 2 hrs<br />Codecs: SBC, AAC, aptX<br />Warranty: 1 year</p><h2>Honorable mentions</h2><h3>JLab Go Air Pop</h3><p>If you just want a competent pair of wireless earbuds for as little money as possible, take a look at the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9KTGFiLVdpcmVsZXNzLUJsdWV0b290aC1SZXNpc3RhbmNlLUNvbm5lY3Rpb24vZHAvQjA5SE41OTRUTD90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby0xbXktMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImJmN2I2N2Y4LWU0MjEtNDQ1MC05NmRiLWQ5Y2RjMTcyOGM3YSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQtJBdz1uSWpBazTKgvZdpP6vnrfGYOOhF6G8WsybjxY&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FJLab-Wireless-Bluetooth-Resistance-Connection%2Fdp%2FB09HN594TL\">JLab Go Air Pop</a>. For $25, they have a light design with decent isolation, plus eight to nine hours of battery life, IPX4 water resistance and a full set of touch controls that actually work. JLab even lets you swap between three EQ presets from the buds themselves. It\u2019s still worth upgrading to the EarFun Free 2S if you can afford it, as the Go Air Pop sounds boomier by comparison and isn\u2019t as clear in the treble and upper-mids. There\u2019s no app support, either. But for $25, expect trade offs like this.</p><p></p><h3>QCY T20 AilyPods</h3><p>If you want the cheapest acceptable pair of open earbuds, meanwhile, get the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9RQ1ktVDIwLUJsdWV0b290aC1NaWNyb3Bob25lLUhlYWRwaG9uZS9kcC9CMEIzTFZTNzlHP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTFteS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYmY3YjY3ZjgtZTQyMS00NDUwLTk2ZGItZDljZGMxNzI4YzdhIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAUVXVhnbEP-0ExHYDl5bNySRnpUiqHKIz3OCaktuoAbA&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FQCY-T20-Bluetooth-Microphone-Headphone%2Fdp%2FB0B3LVS79G\">QCY T20 AilyPods</a>. They are an unabashed rip-off of the third-gen AirPods from a relatively obscure Chinese brand, but they cost $33 and their pleasingly smooth sound is arguably better than the Echo Buds out of the box. They have a higher IPX4 water resistance rating, too. There\u2019s no auto-pausing or multipoint, however, and their touch controls border on unusable. The Echo Buds\u2019 sound is also easier to tidy up, as the handful of EQ presets in the QCY app actually make things worse.</p><p></p><h3>Nothing Ear Stick</h3><p>The <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3VzLm5vdGhpbmcudGVjaC9wcm9kdWN0cy9lYXItc3RpY2siLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImJmN2I2N2Y4LWU0MjEtNDQ1MC05NmRiLWQ5Y2RjMTcyOGM3YSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAX2F_vEtWiwIs9f5IDjpig3GYP9Y8WIRUpV4WEyWSACD&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fus.nothing.tech%2Fproducts%2Fear-stick\">Nothing Ear Stick</a> have a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nothing-ear-stick-hands-on-impressions-090050085.html\">fashionable transparent design</a> and a case that looks like a big, clear tube of lipstick. To access the earbuds, you just twist the case, which is always fun. The earpieces feel sturdy and polished, with responsive controls built around AirPods-style stem squeezes. Audio quality isn\u2019t bad, either, though the treble is a little shouty by default. The main problem is that these are unsealed earbuds that cost $99. That\u2019s still under our \u201cbudget\u201d threshold, but it\u2019s a little too close to AirPods territory for a pair with far fewer software tricks to make up for the sound sacrifices inherent to this design. If you\u2019re particular about aesthetics and <em>must</em> have open earbuds, then the Ear Stick are a good take on the idea. Most others are better off with the Space A40.</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-wireless-earbuds-130028735.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-wireless-earbuds-130028735.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-05T13:00:28+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Meta's Threads is already showing conversations on the web", "description": "<p>With Twitter seemingly on its very last legs, it doesn't come as a big surprise that other social media giants would want to capitalize on the void. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/metas-instagram-linked-twitter-rival-threads-could-arrive-on-july-6th-063129168.html\">Meta is launching Threads,</a> which allows users to write and comment on posts much in the same way as Twitter.
