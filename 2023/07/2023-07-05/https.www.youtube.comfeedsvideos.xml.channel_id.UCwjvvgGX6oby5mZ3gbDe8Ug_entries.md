What a shocking scene this is! Some people are selling themselves for a price in modern society! Well, no, this is a scene from a blind date in Shanghai.
Never has the Chinese government placed as much emphasis on marriage as it does today. Men and women who are willing to get married should be seen by the government as good and responsible citizens. For the government, what bothers them most is the trend that more and more Chinese are unwilling to have children, or even to get married.
