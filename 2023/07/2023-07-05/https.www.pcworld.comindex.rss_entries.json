(I know I have my complaints with it.) If that&rsquo;s the case, a new laptop that celebrates the old, by repackaging a slice of early 1980s desktop computing into a clamshell form factor, might give you a fresh perspective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Called the Book 8088, this netbook-sized PC isn&rsquo;t a pure reproduction of the storied IBM Personal Computer 5150. Instead, it combines genuine original parts (that iconic Intel 8088 chip) with newer hardware to recreate the IBM 5150&rsquo;s specs while squeezing the guts into a much smaller footprint. And not only did <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/going-deep-with-the-book-8088-the-brand-new-laptop-that-runs-like-its-1981/&amp;xcust=2-3-1981511-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ars Technica</a> get hands-on time with one, Ars Technica senior technology reporter Andrew Cunningham spent considerable time studying its ins and outs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ars Technica&rsquo;s chronicle of purchasing and using the Book 8088 is a fascinating blend of technical details and nostalgia&mdash;especially for me, as my first PC was technically an IBM PC 5150. With a clock speed of 4.77MHz, the Book 8088 crawls along compared to today&rsquo;s computers, but in its time the 8088 made previously time-consuming tasks much faster and easier. The main piece of software that my uncle bought for that 5150 before abandoning it to me and my cousins to play with? A spreadsheet program&mdash;Lotus 1-2-3, if memory serves.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Book 8088 photo on Ars Technica\" class=\"wp-image-1981521\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ars-book-8088-shot.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Ars Technica&rsquo;s deep dive on using the Book 8088 details both the history of the IBM 5150 and the technical details of the Book 8088.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Ars Technica</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But the experience isn&rsquo;t a perfect one, much less smooth. As Cunningham details, this $200 AliExpress laptop is a bit of a Frankenstein&rsquo;s creation, one that seems less a product spun up by a business looking to move machines and more of a hobbyist selling their side project. With a modern PC, you might also have problems with memory not being recognized properly on boot, but it doesn&rsquo;t take a soldering iron to fix it. Nor will you be running a bootleg BIOS and copies of Windows 3.0 and MS-DOS 6.22 not meant for use in actively sold products. Today&rsquo;s laptops also have speakers that work and bright LCD screens with good viewing angles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, this glimpse 40 years into the past is mesmerizing. You can see just how far we&rsquo;ve come&mdash;and how much love and care people have for the past. That stolen BIOS software? After being contacted by Cunningham, the original creator eventually put out a new version that officially supports the Book 8088 and provides improvements to its performance (like disk transfer speeds). You can also see how spoiled we are by people who fix older software to work on contemporary hardware (or at least make such versions easily accessible&mdash;hi, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.gog.com/&amp;xcust=2-3-1981511-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">GOG</a>). Part of the deep dive into using the Book 8088 covers the issue of software compatibility; programs written and tuned for the IBM 5150&rsquo;s original specs can crash on the Book 8088.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if this initial account of using the Book 8088 isn&rsquo;t enough of a nostalgia hit for you, there&rsquo;s good news: Ars Technica will be publishing a part two to the piece, which covers how to tune the Book 8088 and make it useful.</p>\n\nDesktop PCs, Laptops</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1981511/this-funky-modern-laptop-recreates-the-ibm-pc-5150-sort-of.html", "date_published": "2023-07-05T20:21:30+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "ChatGPT\u2019s web browser was too good, so its creators blocked it", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s a rare day when a software developer blocks a feature for being<em> too</em> good, but that&rsquo;s exactly what&rsquo;s happened to OpenAI&rsquo;s ChatGPT AI chatbot &ndash;its abilities to browse the web with Bing were simply too effective at dodging paywalls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recall that in March, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1669890/chatgpts-new-web-browsing-power-means-its-no-longer-stuck-in-2021.html\">OpenAI added support for the Bing browser to ChatGPT</a>, specifically to give it knowledge of current events. Until then (and right now) the AI algorithm had only been trained up through the fall of 2021. If you asked it for the result of a recent sporting event, for example, ChatGPT would plead ignorance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Bing support was added, ChatGPT could then ferret out those answers, providing answers that were either current or just a day or so old. But OpenAI discovered that Bing was <em>too</em> good at its job &mdash; it was circumventing paywalls to provide the answers that users asked for. So OpenAI pulled the plug.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We have learned that the ChatGPT Browse beta can occasionally display content in ways we don&rsquo;t want,&rdquo; the company said in a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8077698-how-do-i-use-chatgpt-browse-with-bing-to-search-the-web&amp;xcust=2-3-1981375-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">blog post</a>. &ldquo;For example, if a user specifically asks for a URL&rsquo;s full text, it might inadvertently fulfill this request.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, asking ChatGPT today to summarize an article returns this response: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for the confusion, but as an AI developed by OpenAI, I don&rsquo;t have the ability to browse the internet in real-time or access specific URL content. However, I can certainly provide general information on the topic based on my training data up until September 2021.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other, specialized plugins that take advantage of the internet, such as researching trips via Kayak, are still enabled, OpenAI said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that asking Bing Chat to circumvent a paywall doesn&rsquo;t work. Instead, Bing notes that the article is &ldquo;behind a paywall&rdquo; and encourages you to sign up for the site. Google Bard may decline to provide the exact text, but repeatedly asking for the article&rsquo;s content can eventually produce a detailed summary of what the article reports. It&rsquo;s just another way in which <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1671133/chatgpt-vs-bing-vs-bard-whats-the-best-ai-chatbot.html\">Bing, Bard, and ChatGPT handle different queries</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually, OpenAI&rsquo;s goals have been to provide what users want. In this case, however, noting that the Browse Beta can display content in &ldquo;ways we don&rsquo;t want&rdquo; reflects the values that OpenAI is imposing upon the user. That&rsquo;s good news for journalists who are using premium content to pay their bills and attract new readers, but disappointing for those who have seen the capabilities of AI chatbots become increasingly reined in. In this case, maybe OpenAI will find the happy medium that other sites use: simply &ldquo;reblogging&rdquo; the paid-for content? </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\nOnline Services</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1981375/chatgpts-web-browser-was-too-good-so-its-creators-blocked-it.html", "date_published": "2023-07-05T18:08:53+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "The Lemokey L3 is Keychron\u2019s first gaming keyboard", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>We&rsquo;re big fans of <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/search?q=keychron+review#gsc.tab=0&amp;gsc.q=keychron%20review&amp;gsc.page=1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Keychron&rsquo;s premium keyboard designs</a> here at PCWorld. They consistently stomp the competition in terms of features and build quality, all while coming in at prices significantly lower than similar high-end builds. But there&rsquo;s a glaring omission in Keychron&rsquo;s sprawling lineup: While it offers a growing variety of wireless options, they&rsquo;re all Bluetooth, leaving gamers out in the cold if they want a high-speed cable-free option. Enter the Lemokey L3, the first board in a new Keychron sub-brand. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The L3 offers a familiar suite of options for anyone who&rsquo;s looked at the popular Q series. We&rsquo;re talking full aluminum frame, gasket mounting, RGB lighting, internal foam, hot-swap switch sockets, PBT keycaps standard, and programming with the popular cross-platform VIA tool. You know, all that stuff your favorite keyboard nerd (guilty) won&rsquo;t shut up about. But the design has three big changes designed specifically to appeal to gamers. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Lemokey L3 keyboard exploded layers \" class=\"wp-image-1981264\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Lemokey-L3-Wireless-Custom-Keyboard-structure.webp?w=1096\" width=\"1096\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Keychron</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>First and most importantly, you get both 2.4GHz and Bluetooth wireless, with 1000Hz polling on the former, all of which have N-key rollover. That makes the connection speedy enough for all but the most caffeinated of eSports pros. The dongle + Bluetooth wireless setup is common from major brands like Razer, Logitech, Corsair, et cetera &mdash; in fact it&rsquo;s also on the SteelSeries wireless gaming board I&rsquo;m reviewing right now! &mdash; so this is a reliable upgrade. The other tweaks are four dedicated macro keys on the right side beneath the radial dial and a chunkier, faux-military look to the keyboard case. Again, both <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1916318/razer-blackwidow-v4-pro-keyboard-review.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pretty standard choices</a> for a gaming-specific keyboard. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only potential pitfall I&rsquo;m seeing is reliance on QMK/VIA. Now, VIA is awesome as a tool for customization on a standard keyboard and one that&rsquo;s certainly preferable to some of the awful custom software offered up on most gaming keyboards. (<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1915729/asus-azoth-keyboard-review.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Looking at you, Asus</a>.) And I believe most gamers will like it  because it doesn&rsquo;t actually require any software at all: You can load up custom layouts and macros right in a browser. But without an active Windows program, the Lemokey L3 won&rsquo;t be able to switch profiles on a per-game basis. That&rsquo;s less essential for a keyboard than a mouse since most PC games offer custom layout options anyway. Even so, I can see it being an issue for a small slice of PC gamers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.keychron.com/pages/lemokey-l3&amp;xcust=2-1-1981203-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Lemokey L3</a> will be offered in three colors: white, black, and blue, with Keychron&rsquo;s usual contrasting keycap options on top.

This more advanced method of light and reflection rendering is the hot topic of the graphics industry, and Intel wants to make sure you know it&rsquo;s on trend. To that end, the company has published a blog post highlighting its contributions via several new industrial papers and an instruction course on the latest in graphics tech. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that sounds dry, industrial, and academic, well, it is. Unless you&rsquo;re actively working on new graphical models with industrial-level support, you probably won&rsquo;t get much out of the pos. Intel has created some new ways to boost the efficiency of real-time path tracing, which is cool, but not something that&rsquo;s going to turn the GPU world on its head. The juicy bit is in the middle of the word salad: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>During this talk, titled&nbsp;<em>Path Tracing a Trillion Triangles</em>, we demonstrate that with efficient algorithms, real-time path tracing requires a much less powerful GPU, and can be practical even on mid-range and integrated GPUs in the future.&nbsp;</p>\n<cite>Intel</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Intel is betting big on AI-based neural graphics calculations for compression because you can&rsquo;t make a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/news/gpu-research-generative-ai-update.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1981110-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">press release</a> (spotted by <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.pcgamer.com/intel-reveals-ambitious-plans-to-enable-the-ultimate-in-path-traced-eye-candy-on-integrated-graphics/&amp;xcust=2-1-1981110-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">PCGamer</a>) in 2023 without putting &ldquo;AI&rdquo; in there somewhere.

Designs for a revised standard are now coming to light, and will hopefully solve the issue. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to trusted German leaker <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.igorslab.de/en/rest-in-peace-12vhpwr-connector-welcome-12v-2x6-connector/&amp;xcust=2-1-1980977-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Igor&rsquo;s Lab</a>, the PCI-SIG (the industrial group that standardizes PCI data and power connections) has revised the 12VHPWR design into the upcoming 12V-2&times;6 connector. Physically it looks almost identical, with twelve standard power pins and four extra, smaller pins for sideband data (making it reverse compatible), and it can handle the same maximum 600 watts of power to the connected device. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the leaked specs, slight millimeter-sized tweaks to the connector header will make connections safer and easier to accomplish, and cards will refuse to power on if the four smaller pins aren&rsquo;t properly connected, offering an emergency failsafe that informs the user they need to check the connection. There&rsquo;s also an instruction to manufacturers to tie off cables further behind the male plug in order to avoid warping issues. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Less drastic revisions to the standard also mean that these cables will support 300-watt and 150-watt cards, so that 12V-2&times;6 could more effectively replace a wider variety of power cables used with PCIe cards, and the new standard allows for up to 75 watts delivered over the PCIe connection itself. The new header connector will be delineated from the old one with &ldquo;H++&rdquo; printed on the plastic, as opposed to H+ on the 12VHPWR. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, we might be in for a bit of wait before we see this new header design show up on a large number of consumer products. According to Igor Wallossek, the new standard will arrive along with the PCIe 6.0 and ATX 3.1, and is not yet finalized. We might see early versions of the 12VHPWR design implement some of these changes (almost impossible to tell by eye, remember)&mdash;in fact, Nvidia might be using it on <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://wccftech.com/nvidia-used-12v-2x6-connector-design-instead-of-12vhpwr-on-geforce-rtx-4070-gpus/&amp;xcust=2-1-1980977-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">some RTX 40-series cards already</a>.

Laptops existed when Americal Online was &ldquo;the Internet,&rdquo; and for many years there simply weren&rsquo;t any online text editors or even games beyond textually navigating through a multi-user dungeon, or MUD. Today, the landscape is radically different. A Chromebook can lean on a server to provide the horsepower that it can&rsquo;t, as well as free online storage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1963008/amazon-prime-day-2023-everything-you-need-to-know.html#:~:text=This%20year%2C%20Prime%20day%20falls%20on%20July%2011th,and%2012th%2C%20and%20will%20extend%20to%2024%20countries%3A\">Amazon Prime Day 2023</a> is right around the corner, promising sales on both laptops and Chromebooks. Consider both. But let us offer the following reasons why a Chromebook could make sense. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><strong>Further reading:</strong> See our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/608636/best-chromebooks.html\">best Chromebooks</a> for tested and approved recommendations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chromebooks-are-cheaper\">Chromebooks are cheaper</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, they are, even with ongoing <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/550968/best-laptop-deals-3.html\">laptop deals</a> that go beyond Amazon Prime Day. Our pick for the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/436674/the-best-pc-laptops-of-the-year.html\">best budget laptop</a> is the seemingly perennial Acer Aspire 5, which is about $499 at Walmart. Most budget laptops, though, push into the $600 or $700 range. A quick comparison with Amazon&rsquo;s promoted Chromebooks shows a stark price difference: $160 to $360 or so. That&rsquo;s a 50 percent savings, right there.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Amazon featured Chromebooks\" class=\"wp-image-1976996\" height=\"488\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-30-114125.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><a class=\"imageCredit\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/455E81E4-D1CA-4814-8F6C-8749973EA4EA&amp;xcust=2-1-1976934-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a></div>\n\n\n\n<p>You can point to two reasons right away. First, most buyers prefer a Core or Ryzen chip inside a laptop, just to accommodate the additional performance Windows and its applications require (to run <em>on</em> the laptop, remember). Those chips cost money, more than the Intel Celeron or Arm chips commonly found in Chromebooks. Microsoft also charges for its Windows license, presumably more than the Chrome OS that powers a Chromebook.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chromebooks-are-purpose-built-for-the-web\">Chromebooks are purpose-built for the web</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Chromebooks began life as little more than a web browser, in a world where the web was new and worth exploring. That still holds true today: Chromebooks often use the internet to access the same web services that live on your phone as dedicated apps. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s perfectly fine. Web developers develop for both scenarios. On a laptop, yes, Microsoft Office / Microsoft 365 opens as a dedicated app, but the apps still encourage you to save to the cloud. However, you can still buy Microsoft 365 and work on a Chromebook instead. The difference is that you&rsquo;ll be working in a browser instead, which is typically a cleaner interface. And because you&rsquo;re working on the web, some of the latest features will arrive to you first, because they&rsquo;re easier to deploy online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>True, not every Microsoft 365 app works on a Chromebook. But these are typically the niche apps you can probably ignore: Visio, Project, and Publisher, among others. Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook all work on the web, and thus on Chromebooks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chromebooks-can-be-more-rugged\">Chromebooks can be more rugged</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Chromebooks were built for education. Education means kids! Kids are messy, careless, and drop things. They spill drinks. Not every Chromebook features ruggedized features, and not every laptop should be considered fragile. But if you want a device for storing in your garage shop, or stored in a kitchen nook where it might be knocked over, consider a Chromebook.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"CTL NL6 Chromebook\" class=\"wp-image-1976998\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CTL-NL6x-Chromebook.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The CTL NL6x may be a few years old, but the idea is that rugged Chromebooks are fairly readily available.</figcaption></figure><a class=\"imageCredit\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/introducing-the-new-ctl-nl6x-extra-rugged-chromebook-for-education-300219440.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1976934-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">CTL</a></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chromebooks-expand-now-too\">Chromebooks expand now, too</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Chromebooks have a reputation for being a single-screen device, since they&rsquo;ve been used in the classroom on a child&rsquo;s desk. Most ship with either a dedicated HDMI port for an external display connection, or a USB-C port, or both. The latter is certainly sufficient for a single 1080p display, and possibly a 4K display, too. An external display might not be a necessity, but it&rsquo;s a luxury you&rsquo;d probably like to have as an option, and a Chromebook can offer that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While most Chromebooks don&rsquo;t yet support Thunderbolt, you can use a USB-C dongle if a Chromebook has a USB-C port. At between $20 to $40, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/402858/the-best-usb-c-hubs-for-your-laptop-tablet-or-2-in-1.html\">a USB-C hub or dongle</a> is far cheaper than a Thunderbolt dock anyway, and perfectly suited to adding support for external hard drives and storage cards.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chromebooks-can-print\">Chromebooks can print</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Historically, Chromebooks have had a reputation for being incompatible with printers. And while that&rsquo;s sometimes true, the blame is more with the printer. Many printers ship with all sorts of unwanted utilities to reorder ink and manage print formatting. Chromebooks try and do away with all that, and just <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/7225252&amp;xcust=2-1-1976934-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">print the page</a>. If your printer allows that (Google&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/12403345?sjid=16449697713936982896-NA&amp;xcust=2-1-1976934-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">list of compatible printers</a> is extensive), you&rsquo;ll have no trouble printing with a Chromebook.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chromebooks-run-apps-just-fine\">Chromebooks run apps just fine</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Chromebooks come with a hidden talent: Virtually all modern Chromebooks support Android apps. Many Android apps are designed for phones and tablets, particularly games, which might look a little odd when formatted to a Chromebook screen. But any productivity apps will undoubtedly be designed to also be used on a Chromebook. Some Chromebooks can fold back into a tablet-like mode, too&mdash;giving you the best of both worlds.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-half-width is-float-right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"best-chromebook-for-gaming\">\n\t\t\t\t\tbest chromebook for gaming\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"lenovo-ideapad-5-gaming-chromebook\">Lenovo IdeaPad 5 Gaming Chromebook</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Lenovo IdeaPad 5 Gaming Chromebook\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lenovo-chromebook-16-6.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1500\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review product-widget__review-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__rating-and-review-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__review-details--rating\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1677622/lenovo-ideapad-5-gaming-chromebook-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>For years, Windows users have become accustomed to pointing out that a laptop can run just about anything. And that&rsquo;s true, though the need to run dozens of small helper utilities has, at least anecdotally, diminished. The real distinguishing feature between the two is gaming &mdash; but you&rsquo;ve been able to play Xbox games in the cloud for years, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/393526/how-to-use-chromebooks-for-xbox-cloud-gaming.html\">even on Chromebooks</a>.

Its handful of useful features continues to grow as time goes on, with more and more being teased for future release (like <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1928248/dynamic-lighting-will-be-windows-tool-to-manage-your-pcs-bling.html\">native RGB lighting controls</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But with helpful utilities and settings having trickled out slowly, it&rsquo;s easy to miss a few here and there, especially when flashier tricks hog the news headlines. We&rsquo;ve pulled out 10 features that we don&rsquo;t think get enough love&mdash;if you&rsquo;ve heard of them and haven&rsquo;t tried them yet, now&rsquo;s the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"notepad-tabs\">Notepad tabs</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"Windows 11 feature - Notepad tabs\" class=\"wp-image-1974889\" height=\"678\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Windows-11-features-Notepad-tabs.png?w=1200\" width=\"1199\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">You no longer need to keep multiple Notepad windows open on the Taskbar.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Notepad actually predates Windows, but it&rsquo;s still fully relevant (and useful!) today. The streamlined app lets you open a window to make quick notes. And in Windows 11, you can now manage and navigate between open files in a single window, thanks to the addition of tabs. It&rsquo;s far tidier than opening a new instance of Notepad for each file&mdash;and combined with the new dark mode, it makes the app look and feel modern.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"widgets\">Widgets</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Windows 11 feature - Widgets\" class=\"wp-image-1974894\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Windows-11-features-Widgets.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Widgets for Facebook, Spotify, and PC performance  monitoring could be coming soon.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Windows 11 makes a wealth of info available with just one mouse click (or quick tap of <strong>Win + W</strong>). Right now you can get weather, stock prices, sports updates, and entertainment news, and those cards are slowly being joined by new additions, like for Xbox Game Pass. It&rsquo;s a much easier way to stay up to date than fully shifting to a browser and poking around in your tabs. And if we&rsquo;re lucky, cards available in preview builds of Windows 11&mdash;like <a href=\"http://pcworld.com/article/1809574/facebook-is-testing-a-widget-for-windows-11.html\">Messenger</a>, Phone Link, and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1937422/microsoft-quietly-adds-windows-widgets-to-monitor-your-pc.html\">PC performance monitoring</a>&mdash;will make it to general release.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"screen-recording\">Screen recording</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"Windows 11 feature - Snipping Tool\" class=\"wp-image-1974888\" height=\"610\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Windows-11-features-Snipping-Tool.png?w=1200\" width=\"1199\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Click the video icon, then <em>New</em> to start recording a portion of your screen.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Previous versions of Windows had a Snipping Tool app, but you could only take screenshots.

Some people use their virtual desktops to separate out work from play (or research from daily tasks), while others separate programs by category or function. Navigating between your desktops is as fast as clicking on the Virtual Desktop taskbar icon or tapping <strong>Win + Ctrl + Left/Right Arrow</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"clipchamp\">Clipchamp</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Windows 11 feature - Clipchamp\" class=\"wp-image-1974892\" height=\"678\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Windows-11-features-Clipchamp.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Clipchamp&rsquo;s video editing capabilities amply cover the basics.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1955503/edit-video-like-the-pros-for-free.html\">Davinci Resolve</a> is great if you need deep video editing capabilities, but Microsoft has an alternative free option that&rsquo;s easier to jump into. <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/708192/how-to-use-clipchamp-microsofts-video-editor.html\">Clipchamp</a> can handle quick cuts, fades, and media insertions with ease, and the interface is far less intimidating.
