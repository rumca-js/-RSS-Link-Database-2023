Everybody 1-2-Switch reviewed by Travis Northup on Nintendo Switch.

Everybody 1-2-Switch is a tedious and surprisingly small catalog of unoriginal and mostly poorly designed minigames that’s guaranteed to bring any party grinding to a halt. Even with a few interesting ideas, like Joy-Con hide and seek or the color scavenger-hunting modes, there are simply too few options to keep a group’s attention for one game, much less for multiple matches. Throw in the fact that many ideas are mind-numbingly boring, and others are rehashes of stuff found in the original, and you’ve got yourself a great way to rid yourself of unwanted friendships but not much more than that.

At the turn of the 20th century, oil brought a fortune to the Osage Nation, who became some of the richest people in the world overnight. The wealth of these Native Americans immediately attracted white interlopers, who manipulated, extorted, and stole as much Osage money as they could before resorting to murder. Based on a true story and told through the improbable romance of Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Mollie Kyle (Lily Gladstone), Killers of the Flower Moon is an epic western crime saga, where real love crosses paths with unspeakable betrayal. Killers of the Flower Moon is directed by Martin Scorsese from a screenplay by Eric Roth and Martin Scorsese, based on David Grann’s best-selling book.

Hailing from Apple Studios, Killers of the Flower Moon was produced alongside Imperative Entertainment, Sikelia Productions, and Appian Way. Producers are Martin Scorsese, Dan Friedkin, Bradley Thomas and Daniel Lupi, with Leonardo DiCaprio, Rick Yorn, Adam Sommer, Marianne Bower, Lisa Frechette, John Atwood, Shea Kammer and Niels Juul serving as executive producers. 

Killers of the Flower Moon will premiere in select theaters on October 6, 2023 and wide on October 20, 2023 before streaming globally on Apple TV+

Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One was reviewed by Siddhant Adlakha. Opens in theaters on July 12, 2023.

Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One is a fun and finely tuned summer blockbuster hit that warrants a visit to your local theater to see all that it has to offer. The seventh installment in the Mission: Impossible franchise has an enormous scale and the entertainment value to accompany it. Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One manages to rise above the doom and gloom of Mission Impossible: Fallout creating a film that packs an explosive, self-reflective, and surprisingly funny time for moviegoers. Tom Cruise and company once again leave us not only wanting more but compels us to eagerly count down the days until its sequel slated for 2024.

Episode 3 of Marvel’s Secret Invasion frustrates as much as it enthralls with its half-hearted approach to the spy-thriller genre preventing it from ever being as gripping as it could be.
