<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/">World of Warcraft</a> won't sell Trader's Tender as a standalone product, WoW game director Ion Hazzikostas has confirmed.</p><p dir="ltr">In mid-June, fansite <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/traders-tender-shop-assets-added-on-patch-10-1-5-ptr-333488">Wowhead</a> datamined an assortment of icons representing various amounts of Trader's Tender, a special currency used to purchase rotating cosmetics via the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-trading-post-introduces-a-new-way-for-players-to-buy-items/1100-6511091/">recently introduced Trading Post</a>. With so many different icons of varying amounts made public as part of the datamine, many fans feared developer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-may-be-turning-wow-trading-post-into-an-mtx-shop-suggests-new-datamine/1100-6515229/">Blizzard might be looking to turn the Trading Post into another microtransaction store</a> and Trader's Tender into a premium currency that could be purchased with real money. Trader's Tender is currently primarily earned in-game by logging in once a month and completing various monthly activities, something players worried would be upended by the ability to buy the currency outright.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">Speaking with GameSpot, Hazzikostas cleared up some of the confusion surrounding the datamine. He said definitively that there are no plans to sell Trader's Tender as a standalone product. However, the team does think it makes sense to offer various amounts of Trader's Tender as parts of various bundles, such as expansion deluxe editions. As Hazzikostas pointed out, players who purchased WoW's latest Dragonflight expansion received a one-time reward of 500 Trader's Tender. Blizzard will likely look at doing something similar in the future.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-wont-sell-trading-post-currency-on-its-own-game-director-confirms/1100-6515692/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> is usually considered a battle royale game first and foremost, but the recent arrival of Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN), or "Creative 2.0" to the fans, has ushered in a wave of new game modes and experiences that may signal the future of the game is less like PUBG and more like Roblox. Only Up Fortnite is the debut Creative project from a user simply named army. Based on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2381590/Only_Up/">Only Up</a>, an indie released on Steam in May of this year, the third-person platformer asks players to climb an elaborate and vertically built obstacle course, where risky shortcuts are abundant and falling often means starting from scratch.</p><p>While Only Up currently enjoys 7,000+ "Mostly Positive" reviews on Steam and has become a rising hit among some popular streamers, concurrent player counts indicate that the Fortnite version is already much more popular. At time of writing, the original indie game has about 8,600 concurrent players. Fortnite's version, in the middle of a Wednesday, has over 100,000 concurrent players according to in-game counts Epic recently added to the Creative menu.</p><p>That number doesn't just tower over its inspirator. It's also gaining on, and in some cases surpassing, Epic's own modes. Party Royale, the combat-free hangout space where players tend to show off rare emotes and skins, has just 4,500 players currently playing, with another 9,000 players in Team Rumble, a favorite mode for players completing certain types of challenges or those looking for a lower-stakes version of the game's usual PvP.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-fortnite-creative-mode-game-is-already-much-more-popular-than-the-indie-its-based-on/1100-6515693/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Assassin's Creed Mirage Will Have A "History Of Baghdad" Educational Mode

<p>Ubisoft has announced that the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-mirage/">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> will include a mode called <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/3q7ANVXHm68MIG99qNrPCl">History of Baghdad</a>. This, as Ubisoft says, is an effort to bring "players closer to history." The mode will be available for free when the game launches this fall.</p><p>History of Baghdad offers historically accurate articles that players can read after discovering specific sites throughout the game, serving as a reward for exploration. These articles cover five topics including economy, belief and daily life, government, art and science, and court life.</p><p>The Assassin's Creed games are known for their educational features, such as the Discovery Tour featured in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-origins/">Origins</a>. This mode strips away all combat and gameplay, allowing players to focus on learning about ancient Egypt, instead. In earlier entries, players could read entries in a database, rather than exploring via a separate mode. It seems Ubisoft is taking a similar approach with Mirage.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-mirage-will-have-a-history-of-baghdad-educational-mode/1100-6515689/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/">Rainbow Six Siege</a> is continuing to take steps to combat cheaters and toxicity, and according to Ubisoft, many of the steps the developer has taken thus far are already working wonders.</p><p dir="ltr">In a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/3OjUdY5s7KG9atPnXYucXK">blog post</a> titled "Player Protection Updates - Year 8 and Beyond," Ubisoft has detailed its continued efforts to reduce cheating and toxic behavior, something it calls as one of the top complaints for the shooter genre as a whole. Two of those efforts, the MouseTrap detection system and QB anti-cheat features, appear to be getting the job done.</p><p dir="ltr">MouseTrap is Ubisoft's way of cracking down on console players who want to gain an unfair advantage by using a mouse-and-keyboard. The detection system launched on April 11, 2023, and Ubisoft has revealed that since the system's introduction, there has been a 78% reduction in the number of mouse-and-keyboard users playing Rainbow Six Siege on console.

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/disney-dreamlight-valley/">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a> sports a substantial collection of beloved characters to unlock, a smorgasbord of items with which you can decorate your valley, and a fairly massive collection of adorable companions you can befriend. If that latter feature appeals to you, you may be seeking to fill out your roster by finding the elusive <strong>Rainbow Fox</strong>. Luckily, we've got you covered here with everything you'll need to do--but be warned that it's not going to be a quick and simple process. When you're ready to invest some time, though, read on for how to find the Rainbow Fox.</p><h2>How to get the Rainbow Fox in Disney Dreamlight Valley</h2><p>Getting the Rainbow Fox is a long and sometimes frustrating affair. <strong>This secretive questline isn't marked in your menus</strong> and requires you to track down and find a variety of colorful potatoes and turn them into potions. We aren't sure why potatoes are the necessary items you'll be finding, but we're certain that developer Gameloft went to great lengths to be sure that the Rainbow Fox would take plenty of time and effort to uncover so as to effectively make it a rare and coveted companion.</p><p>Here's the step-by-step process you'll want to follow to get everything needed to make the Rainbow Potion and obtain the Rainbow Fox. <strong>Note that you must unlock the Golden Potato first before any others will show up in the game</strong>.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-how-to-get-the-rainbow-fox/1100-6515685/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Where To Find Ice Cream Cones In Fortnite

<p>In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> Summer Escape, the game's 2023 summer event, you'll want to find ice cream cones as part of multiple in-game challenges, each of them rewarding you with 30,000 XP toward your <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-4-season-3-battle-pass-all-skins-emotes-and-other-rewards/2900-4770/">Chapter 4 Season 3 battle pass</a>. Ice cream isn't so uncommon, but in the heat of a moment, when you feel you <em>need</em> to find it <em>now</em>--I know all too well the feeling of wanting to sprint through my quest log--you'll want to head to specific spots on the map for your best chance to find them. Below you can see a few excellent spots to likely find these randomly placed desserts.</p><h2>Fortnite ice cream cone locations</h2><p>While ice cream cones are liable to spawn in any chest at random, they seem to spawn most in the blue and white coolers you'll find around the map. With that in mind, there are a few sections of the map where these appear most commonly.</p><p><strong>Creeky Compound</strong>, including the temporary landmark to the west of it, <strong>Sunswoon Lagoon</strong>, is one fantastic spot to try first, as the region includes as many as 19 cooler spawn locations.

<p>Actor Daniel Radcliffe has commented on the upcoming Harry Potter TV series that's in the works for the streaming service Max (formerly known as HBO Max), revealing whether or not he plans to be a part of it. Speaking to <a href="https://youtu.be/QfcYU0RAUXc">Access Hollywood</a>, Radcliffe said what you might have guessed, which is that he plans to pass the torch instead of lobbying to play Harry Potter yet again.</p><p>"I think it's very much like they're going for a new series, and there would be somebody else playing Harry. So I think it would be very weird for me to show up.

## Secret Invasion Episode 3 Easter Eggs - 7 Details You Missed In "Betrayed"

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4160798-secretinvasionep3.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>This week on Marvel's Secret Invasion, Nick Fury is on a quest to figure out who he can actually trust. It's not an easy question for a spy like Fury to answer on a normal day, and this certainly ain't a normal one. This time, the spy game is happening inside his very own house.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Warning: This article is full of spoilers for the third episode of Secret Invasion, "Betrayed."</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Fury begins this episode where he ended the last one: at his secret home in Great Britain, with his secret Skrull wife. When he left Earth after the Blip to go live in space, he left her behind too--she's not happy with him, and he suspects she's a part of Gravik's forces bent on ending humanity. She doesn't look all that innocent right now, but the obvious answer probably isn't the right one on this show.</p><p dir="ltr">Talos, meanwhile, is having a bad time. His daughter Gi'ah is with Gravik, but her loyalty may be wavering. And not a moment too soon.</p><p dir="ltr">Talos and Fury spend this episode chasing a new lead: Rebel Skrulls will use a British nuclear submarine to destroy a commercial airliner. After some clandestine maneuvering which involves Fury taking a rebel's son as a hostage at gunpoint, Talos and Fury still can't get what they need to stop the plan--and so Talos burns his last option, using Gi'ah to help stop the plot. Unfortunately, Gravik notices Gi'ah's betrayal, and he kills her.</p><p dir="ltr">That wasn't the end of the episode, though. In the final scene, we seemingly get confirmation of what we feared about Fury's secret Skrull wife--along with a major clue about the rebels' plans. But we'll come back to that. Let's check out this week's Secret Invasion Easter eggs.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. Super-Skrulls</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4160800-secretinvasionsuperskrullsextremis.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Last week we got hints at Gravik's plans for new Super-Skrulls, and this week we both got a brief demonstration of their new powers and an instance of Gravik actually saying "Super-Skrulls" out loud. Not many actors could have pulled that off, but Kingsley Ben-Adir managed it.</p><p dir="ltr">In the comics, the Super-Skrulls use the powers of the Fantastic Four, but on Secret Invasion it's a completely different set of powers: those of Groot from Guardians of the Galaxy, a Frost Beast from the Thor movies, Thanos's lieutenant Black Dwarf (aka Cull Obsidian) from Infinity War, and the Extremis-powered baddies from Iron Man 3. In this episode we only get to see Gravik using his Extremis healing ability, which he demonstrates after Talos stabs him in the hand during their sit-down.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. Varra the Skrull</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4160834-nickfuryskrullwifevarra.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Nick Fury has two scenes with his wife in this episode: the morning after the end of last week's episode, and a flashback set in 1998. We learn that when he left Earth after the Blip, he left her behind as well, and Fury is worried that that fact might have driven her to join with Gravik.</p><p dir="ltr">In the present, Fury calls her Scilla, which is not a reference to anything. But in the flashback we learn that her original Skrull name is Varra. In the comics, Varra is not a regular Skrull, but a Skrull-Kree hybrid who belongs to a group called the Knights of the Infinite, who wanted to bring the Kree and Skrulls together instead of warring with each other forever.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not likely that this version of Varra is half-Kree. Instead, the use of that name is more likely a thematic parallel. Being a Skrull married to a human, she's in a position to help arbitrate this budding conflict between humanity and the Skrull rebels on Earth. If, indeed, that's what she wants to do. More on that shortly.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. Dreykov</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4160836-dreykovblackwidow.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>During Fury's meeting with Varra, she gives him an envelope and tells him: "This should put Dreykov's men on their heels." Dreykov is the creator of the Widows, and the villain of the Black Widow standalone film. But this is not a reference to any specific, previously established mission--we don't know what Dreykov was doing in 1998 beyond training Natasha Romanoff and Yelena Belova to be new Widows.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. Old-school texting</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4160837-secretinvasionoldphonetexting.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>At one point during the episode Gi'ah uses an old-style phone with physical buttons to send a text message about Gravik's activities, giving us a very rare example of a character in a movie or TV show using a numerical keypad to text, which was a bit less straightforward than texting on a smartphone is these days with full on-screen keyboards. This is not a meaningful Easter egg, but it's always nice to remember this kind of nonsense that used to be part of our daily lives--especially when it's something like that that nobody misses.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. Statesmen of World War I</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4160838-secretinvasionstatesmenofworldwari.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Gravik spends a whole scene making fun of this very large, century-old painting by James Guthrie. Just so you appreciate the size of this thing, the painting stands 13 feet tall and 11 feet wide. Guthrie spent more than a decade painting this, and he actually died before it was 100% completed.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. Talos promises retcons, but only vaguely</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4160839-talosremindsnickfurytheskrullsdidalltheworkdsecretinvasion.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>There's a scene where Fury makes a comment about how he's been cleaning up the Skrulls' mess for 30 years. And while that's not completely inaccurate considering their refugee status both then and now, it's also not the full picture. The Skrulls have done a lot of work for Fury over the years, and Talos rubs that in his face a little bit.</p><p dir="ltr">"Every time you were promoted within S.H.I.E.L.D., we did that. Every terror attack you prevented, we did that. Every enemy you sabotaged and ally you leveraged with dirt no one else in the world had access to, we did that."</p><p dir="ltr">If this is a true characterization of events, then it means that Talos and the others have been around actively participating in the MCU since day one, probably in major roles. Certainly you would think that the events of Captain America: The Winter Soldier, which involved a lot of Nick Fury spy intrigue, would have involved their help somehow. Unfortunately, Secret Invasion hasn't specifically retconned <em>any past</em> MCU movie with Skrulls yet, so we can't say for certain what those Skrulls did. But they clearly did many things in many Marvel movies.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. Who was that voice on the phone?</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4160840-secretinvasionskrullwarmachine.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>At the end of the episode, Nick Fury's Skrull wife tries to call Gravik. But Gravik doesn't answer--instead, it's the voice of Don Cheadle, who plays James Rhodes, aka War Machine. So there are two things going on here.</p><p dir="ltr">One of them is very obvious: The Skrulls have a fake War Machine that they're about to use to do some false-flag crimes against humanity. Was Rhodey a Skrull when he met with Fury during last week's episode? That we don't know.</p><p dir="ltr">The second thing concerns the loyalty of Fury's wife Varra. I think the suspicions about her loyalties are a red herring, and that she was calling Gravik as the first part of some kind of spy maneuver. While she was evasive when Fury was asking questions earlier, I think it's because she's in the middle, not on anybody's side but her own right now. And I think she's going to be important to resolving this whole deal because of that.</p></h3></p><br />

<p>Payday 3 will launch with new and revamped special enemy types, a new weapon customization and progression systems, as well as altered difficulty settings and smarter enemy AI.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pD9E5oqoxzc">dev diary</a> with senior game designers Miodrag Kovačević and Jimmy Karlström, as well as lead gameplay programmer Martin Waern, new details about the game's combat were revealed. Payday 3 will launch with four difficulties: Normal, Hard, Very Hard, and Overkill. You will encounter every kind of enemy on every difficulty, as it was a priority for Starbreeze that content not be locked off on lower difficulty settings. Higher difficulties increase enemy numbers, accuracy, and damage. However, enemy health is consistent around all settings, making for a more even player experience.</p><div>          </div><p>As for enemy types, the most common enemies are SWAT and Heavy SWAT units. More uncommon enemies include Shield and Sniper units. Enemy tactics have received an upgrade, with the standard SWAT units positioning themselves around the shield as cover. The game also includes both new and returning special enemies.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-3-has-revamped-special-enemies-and-new-gun-progression/1100-6515682/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The first reviews for the next Mission: Impossible movie, Dead Reckoning Part One, are here, and they are mostly positive just as the last few outings, Fallout and Rogue Nation.  </p><p>Dead Reckoning is the first half of the franchise's first two-part narrative. It's the seventh film in the series, based on the popular spy show of the 1960s.  Ethan Hunt and his IMF (Impossible Missions Force) team have to track down a terrifying new weapon that threatens humanity before it falls into the wrong hands...again. Now facing a mysterious enemy, Ethan is forced to consider that nothing can matter more than the mission. </p><p>Mission: Impossible--Dead Reckoning Part One is directed by Christopher McQuarrie, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Erik Jendresen. The film stars Tom Cruise, Hayley Atwell, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Esai Morales, Vanessa Kirby, Pom Klementieff, and Henry Czerny.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/review-roundup-for-mission-impossible-7/1100-6515683/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Apple-Epic Legal Battle Could Be Headed For The Supreme Court

<p dir="ltr">Apple and Epic Games have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-v-apple-trial-wrap-up-judge-makes-landmark-decision-in-massive-tech-case/1100-6490954/">battling in court for years</a> over a disagreement over the App Store's 30% platform cut, which led to the removal of Fortnite from the storefront. Now, Apple's attorneys has requested that the Supreme Court weigh in on an injunction from the Ninth Circuit that currently prevents Apple from using its "anti-steering rules" against iOS app developers.</p><p dir="ltr">An anti-steering rule is a legal term that basically means that these developers can't offer out-of-app payment methods with in-app links, which is exactly what Epic Games tried to do back in 2020. Per <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/apple-wants-to-take-its-legal-battle-with-epic-to-the-supreme-court/">VGC</a>, the Ninth Circuit ruled that Apple can't prevent developers from including these links or buttons that take players to non-App Store payment options, which would obviously prevent Apple from collecting its 30% cut on those transactions.</p><p dir="ltr">Though Apple suffered this defeat in this latest juncture in the case, the overall direction of the legal battle has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apple-declares-resounding-victory-over-epic-games-following-appeals-court-ruling/1100-6513515/">largely decided</a> in the iPhone maker's favor. The Ninth Circuit mostly upheld a previous ruling that did not find muster in Epic's claims that Apple's iOS platform violates certain federal laws intended to prevent anticompetitive market behavior. It's unclear if the Supreme Court will take the case on appeal, but if it does, the resulting ruling will likely have a large impact on not only the major video game platform holders, but digital marketplaces in general.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apple-epic-legal-battle-could-be-headed-for-the-supreme-court/1100-6515681/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Halo Infinite Has Lost 98% Of Its Peak Player Count On Steam

<p dir="ltr">Halo Infinite's average daily peak of players on Steam is now around 2% of its all-time record, according to <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/1240440">Steamcharts</a>. These two numbers, around 6,000 and 256,000 respectively, demonstrate how Halo Infinite has struggled to maintain an audience on Steam. This observation was first posted on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/14oy82f/til_halo_infinite_has_lost_nearly_98_of_its/">Steam subreddit</a>, where it was quickly upvoted and reposted online.</p><p dir="ltr">Given that Halo is traditionally associated with Xbox, it's important to remember that these numbers are specific to Steam, and not the PC platform in general. Halo Infinite has a separate digital version of PC that isn't tied to Steam, and we don't know the numbers on Xbox either. It's also worth noting that Game Pass users aren't included in these figures. Still, this is an indicator that Halo Infinite isn't retaining players in the way that many successful shooters do, such as Call of Duty, PUBG, or Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, which are all in Steamchart's top 10.</p><p dir="ltr">Halo Infinite has suffered a number of public setbacks since its release, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-franchise-director-has-seemingly-departed-343-industries/1100-6513297/">multiple high-level staff members</a> departing developer 343 Industries this year. The developer recently announced that the game will not have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-loses-story-cutscenes-for-season-4-343-focusing-on-gameplay-features/1100-6515330/">narrative cutscenes</a> in the coming seasons. In a recent interview ahead of its Season 4 release, head of live service Sean Baron said that the developer is focusing on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-halo-infinite-needs-to-do-to-improve-according-to-its-devs/1100-6515269/">delivering consistent quality</a> within the game from season to season. It's unclear if 343 is working on a sequel to Infinite, but Xbox Game Studios boss Matt Booty <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-halo-infinite-sequel-in-development-exec-wont-say-but-feels-confident-in-new-leadership/1100-6515283/">told Axios</a> in June that he's "confident in the leadership team" at the studio.</p>

## Official Pokemon Forums Launch, And The Internet Does What It Does

<p dir="ltr">There are no shortage of places to discuss Pokemon on the internet, but there's only one official Pokemon Forum, which launched this week. Unfortunately, it seems that internet trolls have already flooded the site with inappropriate content, which is generally what seems to happen to these sort of communities.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">So there’s an official Pokemon forum now apparently and LMAO?? <a href="https://t.co/oDXyYbtDY2">pic.twitter.com/oDXyYbtDY2</a></p>  — Touya! ★ (@Touyarokii) <a href="https://twitter.com/Touyarokii/status/1676381060983304192?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">July 5, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/pokemon-launches-official-forums-is-instantly-spammed-with-questionable-content/">VGC</a>, the Pokemon Forum was largely created from the online Pokemon Trading Game online forums, and it's dedicated to everything Pokemon, from the games to its various TV shows. However, it seems that the forum's moderation has left something to be desired in these early days, as Twitter users like Touyarokii discovered seemingly dozens of inappropriate threads. Popular topics of discussion include which Pokemon you're attracted to, as well as other obvious jokes.</p><p dir="ltr">Given that the forum has rules against "inappropriate themes" and "foul language," we can only hope that the official Pokemon Forum can be cleaned up for all fans of Pokemon worldwide. The forum's rules also state that "Pokemon is for everyone." The most notable upcoming Pokemon projects are the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-scarlet-and-violets-upcoming-expansions-get-new-trailer-during-direct/1100-6515327/">two expansions</a> for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero Part 1: The Teal Mask and its follow-up, The Indigo Disk.

<p dir="ltr">Say hello to The Last Hope - Dead Zone Survival, a clear knockoff of The Last of Us from <a href="https://virtualglobal.games">a Republic of Moldova team called Virtual Global Games</a>.

And of course, he finds a girl named Eve instead of Ellie, though the physical appearance is almost identical.</p><p dir="ltr">There is one clear distinction between the stories in The Last Hope compared to The Last of Us, though. The trailer for the former--seen below--explains that Brian is sent into the future to stop the zombie outbreak from ever happening.

<p>Some of the developers who helped create Rare's iconic Banjo-Kazooie series have commented on the possibility of another entry in the series, and they aren't totally hopeful about it.</p><p>Grant Kirkhope, the composer of Banjo's theme music, told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/lying-to-nintendo-and-miyamoto-shame-banjo-kazooie-devs-reflect-on-its-25th/">VGC</a> that a third mainline entry in the series may never happen because of the difficulty in finding the right team to do it justice. Not only that, but Kirkhope said there might not be enough interest from fans to justify it.</p><p>"I feel like you'd have to get a team with the humor that we had back then and that's hard to replicate," he said. "I think Rare would be open to somebody if they found the right team, but I don't feel like that team exists. Also, I'm not convinced the audience is there either."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/banjo-kazooie-dev-is-not-convinced-people-want-another-game/1100-6515658/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
