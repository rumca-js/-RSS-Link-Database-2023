How the news broke was Tucker sharing a video of his biographer, Chadwick Moore, discussing why <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tucker-carlson-biographer-shares-reason" target="_blank">"he" thought Tucker was fired from Fox News</a>.  Those of us who are political nerds are anticipating some juicy details, and we have our first excepts thanks to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12312213/Tucker-Carlson-talks-alcoholic-friendship-Hunter-Biden-new-biography.html" target="_blank">The Daily Mail</a>.</p><p>Tucker opens up about his "four vodkas for breakfast" battle with alcoholism. As well as his friendship with another famous addict, Hunter Biden. The Carlsons and Bidens used to be very close, and Tucker's wife Susan is still very close with Hunter's first wife Kathleen. Kathleen is the wife Hunter cheated on with his at the time recently widowed sister-in-law.</p><p>One the Carlson remarked about the Biden's is that they were never as extreme as they portray in 2023.</p><blockquote>Hunter Biden was not liberal in any sense that I recognized. Biden has since become a trans activist and all that, but his family, they were pretty darn Catholic. They weren't anti-gun at all. Hunter and Kathleen weren't for abortion. They're old Democratic party, the white working-class Democratic party, that does not exist anymore. Biden was about the last relic of that.</blockquote><p>That's Hunter Biden. Joe Biden, like a growing number of Americans, Tucker has no use for.</p><blockquote>Not that there was every much depth to Joe Biden. He was famously stupid. Everyone always said he was stupid, and he'd say anything. So that hasn't changed - he was always skin-deep, fake, and shallow, with the hair plugs, and face lifts, and the pat-you-on-the-back stuff. But he was always very friendly.</blockquote><p>Carlson, who is said to be building a new media empire, is hands down the most interesting political player this election cycle. And that includes all the candidates running for president. We saw what Tucker <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tucker-carlson-white-house-cocaine" target="_blank">unencumbered by cable news looks like</a> when he MCed the first GOP presidential candidate forum. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tucker-carlson-asa-hutchinson" target="_blank">Not everyone survived</a>. And Mike Pence got so embarrassed, I had nothing to write about it other than a "ha ha" .gif of Nelson from The Simpsons.</p><p>Tucker interviewing candidates in a debate-like forum let conservatives finally see the clear difference between a conservative asking questions in a Republican primary about issues the primary voters care about vs <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tucker-carlson-chris-christie-debate" target="_blank">corporate journalismers doing it</a>. The next year or so, starting in August 1st when the book drops, are going to be verrrrrry interesting.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

<p>That's Crystal. Crystal is a man who dresses up like a girl slut and performs as a girl slut. it is an art form commonly <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/school-board-mom-dresses" target="_blank">referred to as "drag"</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/explicit-performance-man-texas" target="_blank">its performers "queens."</a> It used to be exclusive in bars for adults since the performances are raunchy and sexual. But over the past few years, these drag queens have rocketed up to #2 on the Left's Pound-for-Pound Most Marginalized Rankings, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lia-thomas-teammate-speaks-out" target="_blank">behind only transgenders</a>. Ironic, because there was a time when <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/drag-queens-banned-from-pride-event-for-offending-trans-people" target="_blank">the trans people almost got the queens kicked out of the club</a>.</p><p>Now, these sexualized performances are family-friendly and if you don't want to expose your children to it, you are a -phobe. A bunch of -phobes were unhappy with Crystal's recent performance at a UK theme park. It included him performing a simulated sex act with an angle grinder.</p><p>An angle grinder is a power tool best used to remove paint, cut titles, and clean metal. In none of the top ten uses for the tool does it say "play with near your penis in front of children." But that's what happened during a performance at Adventure Island in the UK<strong>. </strong>A family-friendly performance.</p><p>Parents were aghast, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12310799/EXCLUSIVE-Family-theme-park-apologises-drag-queen-act-left-parents-horrified-Boss-confirms-not-future-Pride-celebrations-Ru-Pauls-Drag-Race-UK-star-used-angle-grinder-crotch-show.html" target="_blank">according to The Daily Mail</a>.</p><blockquote>"I won't be going back and I won't be taking my kids there."<br /><br />"That is a line you don't cross."<br /><br />"That tells me everything you need to know about how they value children."<br /></blockquote><p>Adventure Island said to the Daily Mail there was a communication in what would and would not be allowed as part of the performance. The grinding act was most definitely a nonstarter and NOT family-friendly entertainment.</p><p>This next quote, hang it in the Louvre.</p><blockquote>Rest assured we will not be rebooking this act or participating in any future PRIDE celebrations it's just not for us, we tried to be inclusive but it has backfired on us.</blockquote><p>To be fair, Crystal insists nothing he did was sexual. And that gyrating with a power tool by his crotch is only "viewed' as sexual because he is in drag. It's important to hear both sides.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Conservative basketball star nails Charles Barkley's Bud Light defense, explains the issue slow  enough to understand

	I didn't bother writing about Charles Barkley's lame comments about the Bud Light boycott where he called people boycotting "anti-gay." I'm a fan of Charles, and it's the same uninformed opinion some people I know IRL have, so I just rolled my eyes. But the Orlando Magic's Jonathan Isaac responded, and I thought he brought up an excellent point.
</p><p>
	To recap the Bud Light debacle: the company thought aligning itself with <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dylan-mulvaney-bud-light-response" target="_blank">controversial titface performer Dylan Mulvaney</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-this-is-fine" target="_blank">lashing out at its current customer base</a> would be a good marketing movie. It continues <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2023/07/19/bud-light-social-media-dylan-mulvaney/" target="_blank">to not be that</a>.
</p><p>
	Sir Charles was <a href="https://www.outkick.com/charles-barkley-bud-light-support-fk-you-video/" target="_blank">at a golf tournament</a> and, out of the blue, entered the culture war: "There’s a lot of people out here hating on Bud Light right now. I just want to say this, and I mean this from the bottom of my fucking heart. Hey, if you’re gay, I love you. If you’re a transvestite, I love you. And let me say something. If you disagree, f*ck you."
</p><p>
	It would be hilarious if the Left now came after him for saying "transvestite." But I digress.
</p><p>
	Isaac, who is <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jonathan-isaac-clothing-line-nba" target="_blank">launching a pro-America clothing line next month</a>, is confused about what Barkley was even talking about. Nothing he said would get him canceled, and Barkley doesn't even know what the issue is about.
</p><p>
	"It’s insane that In order to be the primary influence on your children you have to go to war against influencers, the media, movies, multi million and billion dollar corporations, and good people like Charles who choose to fall in line with empty politically correct statements and narratives."

</blockquote>
<p>What people choose not to understand is that it's not about Dylan. It's about everything before Dylan. It's the all-star game being moved from Atlanta because of lies being told about a piece of legislation. It's that every company in America is commanded to speak out any time Leftists have their bug up their as about a bill or a Supreme Court decision, and a media that calls each company wanting to know where their statement is. It's the tens of millions of dollars companies dish out every time they are cyberbullied to support whatever the new social "justice" cause of the day is.</p><p>Dylan Mulvaney presenting as a basic bitch who didn't know what college basketball was while shotgunning a beer was one woke pander too many. Americans - not just right-wingers, but a sizable amount of apolitical middle America -- had enough. And they are choosing other beers as a result.</p><p>Perhaps Isaac and Barkley can sit down over a few Yuengling to discuss the issue further.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: Progressive city crime's gotten so bad, they are locking up ice cream and frozen pizzas

When people living in the suburbs go to vote -- and there aren't distractions that take the focus off of Joe Biden Democrats' failed policies -- they vote for conservatives. In 2021 and 2022 it was two things: school indoctrination, and rampant crime.</p><p>People outside of the cities see what is happening inside the cities, see who on their local ballot supports the policies causing it, and are voting for the other person.

## Jason Aldean's anti-woke "Try That in A Small Town" rockets to #1 on the iTunes charts

No sooner did Aldean release a video for his song "Try That in a Small Down" then did journalisming outlets created content calling it <em>"...a modern lynching song"</em> with <em>"very scary"</em> AND <em>"racist"</em> lyrics. The New York City-based MTV-owned CMT <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/cmt-cancels-jason-aldean-video" target="_blank">pulled the video amid the controversy</a>. </p><p>Well, the song is now #1 on both the iTunes all-genre AND music video charts.

</p><h3>What's the controversy over "Try That in A Small Town?"</h3><br /><p>Jason Aldean released the song, "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jason-aldean-song-backlash" target="_blank">Try That in A Small Town</a>," in May. The artist describes the song as referring to "the feeling of a community that I had growing up, where we took care of our neighbors, regardless of differences of background or belief. Because they were our neighbors, and that was above any differences."</p><p>People, mostly Leftists and the media (but I repeat myself), who put differences above anything else did not like the video that was released a few days ago. It used news footage of the chaos plaguing America over the past few years. They accused it of being a "pro-lynching song" that was "scary" and talked too much about guns.</p><p>Aldean is not backing down. <em>"These references are not only meritless, but dangerous. There is not a single lyric in the song that references race or points to it- and there isn’t a single video clip that isn’t real news footage -and while I can try and respect others to have their own interpretation of a song with music- this one goes too far."</em></p><h3>How can I watch "Try That in A Small Town?"</h3><br /><p>

<p>As we write this, MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski is on <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mika-attacks-joe-biden-staff" target="_blank">with the White House switchboard demanding to speak to a manager</a>. Remember kids, it is not Joe Biden's fault that he is deteriorating in front of our very eyes. It is his staff's fault for putting him in a position that allows us to see him deteriorating before our very eyes.  It's the staff's fault for *check notes* allowing him to sit in a chair next to another world leader and speak to the press for a minute in a highly controlled press event.</p><p>Israeli President Isaac Herzog had the same look on his face everyone in America -- particularly those working in <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/iranians-ukrainians-joe-biden-sotu" target="_blank">Kamala Harris's office</a> -- have watching this. When the other world leader is thinking "Dude, what the hell," it is not a stellar moment in international relations.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
