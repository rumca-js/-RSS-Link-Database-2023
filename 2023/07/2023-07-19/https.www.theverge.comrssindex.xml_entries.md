  <p id="8TUydb">There seems to be a lot of focus on streaming live sports, but based on comments from Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos, it appears the company plans to largely stay out of that game for the moment. “We really think that we can have a really strong offering for sports fans on Netflix without having to be part of the difficulty of the economic model of live sports licensing,” <a href="https://youtu.be/FBFcFWZ4hPs?t=1982">he said</a> during the company’s second quarter earnings call on Wednesday.</p>
<p id="RssaEe">That quote was the final part of a longer response about the company’s sports strategy. “We’re super excited about the success of our sports-adjacent programming,” he said, pointing to recent titles like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/22/23610867/netflix-nfl-quarterback-docuseries-patrick-mahomes"><em>Quarterback</em></a> and <em>Tour de France: Unchained. </em>With the latter, he talked about how it did “exactly...</p>

  <p id="KGjqAZ">Tesla revealed new measurements for its long-delayed Cybertruck in its Q2 earnings report. The polarizing truck will be less than 19 feet long and will have a bed that’s longer than six feet, which is shorter than Ford’s best-selling F-150 Lighting, which is 19.25 feet long with a 5.5-foot bed.</p>
<p id="VD8NCK">“We continue to build release candidates of the Cybertruck on our final production line in Austin,” Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on an earnings call today. Musk claims it’s the first four-door pickup that comes in that bed and length size combination and that there’s “a lot of new technology” in the vehicle.</p>
<p id="knoYID">Tesla claims Cybertruck will “break a lot of boundaries” technologically and architecturally in its earnings press release today.</p>

  <p id="aUhfAa">Tesla is in “early discussion” to license its Full Self-Driving (FSD) driver-assist technology to another major automaker, Elon Musk said in an earnings call Wednesday. He did not reveal the name of the company, though he did say that licensing FSD was always part of the plan. </p>
<p id="aiWHsd">“We’re not we’re not trying to keep this to ourselves,” Musk said on the call. “We’re more than happy to license it to others.”</p>

  <p id="TABdt4">Back in 2017, illustrator and former <em>BuzzFeed</em> employee Adam Ellis penned <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/adamellis/my-apartment-is-being-haunted-by-the-ghost-of-a-dead-child">a truly terrifying multi-month Twitter thread about his home potentially being haunted by a tiny ghost child</a>. I reread the thread just before writing this article, and I’d like to confirm that even six years later, it is supremely creepy. It felt like a new form of storytelling with its blend of audio, video, photos, and microblogs posted over a long series of months. So I do definitely understand the desire to adapt it all into a more easy-to-track format like a film.</p>
<p id="19Qzks">At the time, plenty of people responded to the viral thread with “Oh my god, that should be a movie,” and while we might have acknowledged it was a good yarn, we did laugh. (Largely because we were...</p>

<p id="diciFj">The story of the Alienware Area-51m is pretty dang relevant today because Framework <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22665800/framework-laptop-16-hands-on-preview-modular-gaming-laptop">just opened preorders for another laptop</a> that offers the same. </p>
<p id="CkitN7">But it turns out Dell never had to meaningfully face that lawsuit. Area-51m buyers never successfully banded together in a class action case. Dell was able to force them into binding arbitration, I found, when I went looking to see what happened to the suit. </p>

You can always buy a tablet or use your phone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling on Twitter.

The 2023 Women’s World Cup kicks off in Australia and New Zealand on July 20th, which means that I’ll be getting up very early — and staying up pretty late — in order to catch as much of it as I can.

There’s just one problem: I have no idea where to post about it.</p>

  <p id="d4EcfL">Apple is creating its own AI-powered chatbot that some engineers are calling “Apple GPT,” <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-19/apple-preps-ajax-generative-ai-apple-gpt-to-rival-openai-and-google?sref=ExbtjcSG">according to a report from <em>Bloomberg</em></a>. The company reportedly doesn’t have any solid plans to release the technology to the public yet.</p>
<p id="9cbzLa">As noted by <em>Bloomberg</em>, the chatbot uses its own large language model (LLM) framework called “Ajax,” running on Google Cloud and built with Google JAX, a framework created to accelerate machine learning research. Sources close to the situation tell the<em> </em>outlet that Apple has multiple teams working on the project, which includes addressing potential privacy implications.</p>

  <p id="mfkV06">Earlier this year, I purchased my first electric vehicle, a 2023 Volkswagen ID.4 Pro S — moonstone gray, moon roof, all-wheel drive. I knew that the car would start losing value as soon as I drove it off the dealer lot — <a href="https://www.ramseysolutions.com/saving/car-depreciation#:~:text=So%2C%20as%20you%20research%20different,you%20drive%20off%20the%20lot.">just like the old saying goes</a>. What I didn’t realize was that the whole charging system that my shiny new EV relied on was about to become obsolete. </p>
<p id="nKamGY">In May, Ford and Tesla announced a surprise deal in which the Blue Oval would adopt Elon Musk’s charging connector, named the North American Charging Standard (NACS). Tesla’s Supercharger network is widely considered vastly superior to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/17/23308612/ev-charging-broken-unreliable-survey-jd-power">junky</a>, <a href="https://www.autoweek.com/news/a40576648/ev-charger-maintenance-problem/">bug-riddled</a> public charging network in the US.

Sure, it stars a bunch of adorable plant-like beings — the titular pikmin — who navigate a huge world full of similarly cute creatures. It’s bright and colorful in the way that Nintendo games tend to be. But it’s also pretty creepy at times, with unsettling enemies to go up against, dark caverns to explore, and the way the pikmin will throw themselves into battle, with hordes able to overwhelm and kill larger creatures, whose corpses they then cart off to be repurposed. <em>Pikmin</em> is light on the surface but darker the more you think about it — and the latest entry takes things a step further with a survival mode and some ghostly...</p>

  <p class="p--has-dropcap" id="gWEIXs">How much would fans pay for the ultimate action figure? A company named Robosen seems determined to find out — with Transformers toys that <em>transform themselves</em> like they do in the classic cartoon. </p>
<p id="VMyPTI">First, it was a $750 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/22623017/optimus-prime-transformer-auto-converting-programmable-robot-hasbro-robosen">self-transforming Optimus Prime</a> robot, then a $750 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23022777/hasbro-robosen-transforming-optimus-prime-robot-trailer">transforming <em>trailer</em></a> to go with. $1,500 total to bring the leader of the Autobots to life. </p>
<p id="qnN73u">Now, Hasbro and Robosen are introducing Grimlock so you can own the king of the Dinobots too — for a cool $1,700 all by itself. </p>

  <p id="uboWgr">Intel announced earlier this week that its compact and upgradable NUC computers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/11/23790956/intel-nuc-compact-pc-discontinued">were being discontinued</a>, but now Asus is stepping in to manufacture and develop future NUC systems instead. While Intel won’t be making its cute small form factor PCs anymore, Asus will receive a non-exclusive license to Intel’s NUC (Next Unit of Computing) product designs.</p>
<p id="sxYIfm">“As we pivot our strategy to enable ecosystem partners to continue NUC systems product innovation and growth, our priority is to ensure a smooth transition for our customers and partners,” <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-nuc-systems-agreement.html?cid=iosm&amp;source=twitter&amp;campid=newsroom_posts&amp;content=100004379295872&amp;icid=always-on&amp;linkId=100000210067785#gs.3a4oow">says Sam Gao</a>, general manager of Intel Client Platform Solutions. “I am looking forward to ASUS continuing to deliver exceptional products and supporting our NUC systems customers.”</p>
