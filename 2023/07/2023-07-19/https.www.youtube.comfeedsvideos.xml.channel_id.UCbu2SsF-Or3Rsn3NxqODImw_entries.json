It took me more than 20 hours with Pikmin 4 before I identified that the sensation it evoked was the same as that of completing my to-do list. Pikmin 4 is a game, sure, but it's also a sort of low-impact activity that gives you the same satisfaction of checking off a list of small, relatively simple tasks. That makes it pleasant to play, but that quality also makes it feel discordant when it briefly adds elements that provide a mild but noticeable degree of pressure--elements that make it more traditionally \"game-like.\" On the whole, I think I prefer Pikmin the activity to Pikmin the game.\n\nIf you want to read the review check it out here: https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pikmin-4-review-veggie-might/1900-6418090/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3M3OY3k4cVk", "date_published": "2023-07-19T13:00:05+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/3M3OY3k4cVk/hqdefault.jpg"}]
