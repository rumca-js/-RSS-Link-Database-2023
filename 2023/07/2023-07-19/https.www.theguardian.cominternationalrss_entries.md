## How do you get a chatty friend to shut up? I think I have found the answer | Adrian Chiles

<p>What’s better than a companion who knows just what to say? A companion who knows when to zip it. But sometimes they need a little nudge …</p><p>I like a chat as much as the next chap, but a bit of quiet is nice, too. It’s a difficult balance to strike. While the main thing you want with a friend is plenty to talk about, being able to coexist in companionable silence is also important. It’s a lot to ask of someone, to be charmed and charming, interesting and interested, yet with the insight to sense when it’s time to pipe down.</p><p>It’s not that I have anyone I would call a friend who bores me; if anything, the opposite is true. But that presents its own challenges. If the subject matter is interesting, it requires attention. And if there is too much of it, that gets tiring.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/19/chatty-friend-shut-up-companion">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Totally full of spiritual energy’: Ustad Noor Bakhsh, the Pakistani musician discovered on the side of a road

<p>Inspired by birdsong and playing the obscure zither-like benju, the 78-year-old is enjoying a surge in global popularity</p><p>In early 2022, when Daniyal Ahmed set off on a road trip from Karachi in Pakistan into the neighbouring province of Balochistan , his only contacts were a few distant connections who he hoped would lead him to a legendary musician within the region. After circling villages near Pasni, a fishing port on the Arabian sea about a six-hour drive from Karachi, Ahmed by chance spotted Ustad Noor Bakhsh on the side of a lonely road sitting next to his broken motorbike, waiting for help.</p><p>Ahmed is an anthropologist who teaches at Habib University, and had been chasing down masters like Bakhsh in remote regions across Pakistan. Bakhsh was already well known within Balochistan both as a solo benju (a type of zither) player and as Balochi vocalist Sabzal Sami’s accompanist for three decades. Ahmed was alerted to Bakhsh’s talents after he saw a video of him playing circulating on Facebook. A musician himself, he’s invested in amplifying regional talent that has become obscured in a country lacking robust infrastructure to support musicians, especially those who play traditional music.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/19/totally-full-of-spiritual-energy-ustad-noor-bakhsh-the-pakistani-musician-discovered-on-the-side-of-a-road">Continue reading...</a>

## $7,000 a day for five catchphrases: the TikTokers pretending to be ‘non-playable characters’

<p>There are anarchic, erotic undertones to ‘NPC streaming’, the trend in which ordinary people play video-game characters</p><p>If you haven’t seen them yet, the videos are mesmerizing. A content creator with long, straight hair sits at her kitchen table, rapidly stringing together nonsense catchphrases, over and over with the same cheerful expression and tone. “Yes yes yes. Mmm, ice cream so good. Ooh, you got me feeling like a cowgirl. Gang gang. Mmm, ice cream so good. Yes yes yes.”</p><p>The trend is called “NPC streaming” – named after the non-playable characters in video games that awkwardly repeat pre-programmed phrases and movements. Its most recognizable face is Pinkydoll, a Montreal content creator whose “ice cream so good” clips went viral this week. Those phrases are actually her real-time reactions to gifts from her thousands of viewers, who send over digital ice-cream cones, roses, doughnuts and hearts, which pop up as cartoon graphics on the screen. The gifts are worth anywhere from half a cent to a few dollars – but with a big audience it adds up. In a full day of NPC streaming, Pinkydoll says she’s netted more than $7,000.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/19/tiktok-npc-streaming-live-stream-pinkydoll">Continue reading...</a>

## The Spin | Women’s Ashes has been enthralling, and for that you can thank England

First, Heather Knight gave a chirpy press conference, during which she proclaimed the series “the best there’s ever been in the history of the women’s game”. Then, aboard the team bus, her teammates spent the journey to Taunton eating cake in celebration of Sophia Dunkley’s 25th birthday. “We put some music on and tried to enjoy the moment,” Nat Sciver-Brunt said.</p><p>English cricket’s current philosophical dilemma – encompassing both ‘Jonball’ and its male equivalent, ‘Bazball’ – is whether, as long as you entertain the public along the way, winning actually matters. Over the past four weeks, England have consistently squared up to the previously invincible Australia, generating six unforgettable games of white-ball cricket, plus a five-day Test during which Tammy Beaumont became the first English player in 89 years of women’s Test cricket to breach the double-hundred barrier.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/19/the-spin-womens-ashes-enthralling-thank-england-cricket">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s still frenetic and funny, but the second slice of the incredible kitchen drama broadens into a deeply moving look at what makes a life worthwhile.

If anyone was wondering how the makers would replicate the stress and chaos of life in a working kitchen while the gang are on hiatus … this is how. Even after Carmy appoints his sister Sugar (Abby Elliott) as project manager, the discovery of various bone-deep problems with the building, the impossible timeline demanded by their new loan arrangements with Uncle Jimmy (Oliver Platt) and the ever-volatile presence of Cousin Richie (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) keep the screaming edge of desperation as keenly whetted as ever.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/19/the-bear-season-two-review-somehow-even-more-delicious-than-before">Continue reading...</a>
