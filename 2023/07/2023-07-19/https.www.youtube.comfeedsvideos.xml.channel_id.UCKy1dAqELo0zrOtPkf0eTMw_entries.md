Immortals of Aveum: The Style of Immortals is a 3-part docuseries that follows professional cosplayer, Alicia Marie on her quest to ideate, craft, and become Grand Magnus Kirkan in time for San Diego Comic Con 2023. 

In the final part of this docuseries, Alicia finalizes her Grand Magnus Kirkan cosplay and gets some tips on how to become Kirkan from the developers of the game. Will they be impressed with her SDCC debut?

In the magic shooter game, Immortals of Aveum, the Everwar is an endless conflict that has consumed the world in bloodshed for thousands of years. Only two superpowers remain, the kingdoms of Lucium and Rasharn, as they fight against each other for the control of magic. However, there is one fearless leader who commands the Order of the Immortals to protect Lucium, Grand Magnus Kirkan. Capable of wielding magic that can manipulate physical matter and alter the surroundings, Kirkan embodies the strength and hope that is needed to win the Everwar. So IGN challenged cosplayer Alicia Marie to create a Kirkan cosplay worthy of Aveum. Watch as we go behind the scenes of the design, fabrication, and build … to transform a real life icon into Grand Magnus Kirkan.
Presented by Immortals of Aveum, available August 22nd on the PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC

In this clip from Star Trek: Strange New Worlds Season 2, Episode 6, “Lost In Translation,” Uhura (Celia Rose Gooding) takes center stage as she meets James T. Kirk (Paul Wesley) for the first time!

Here's the logline for the episode according to Paramount+: "Uhura seems to be the only one who can hear a strange sound. When the noise triggers terrifying hallucinations, she enlists an unlikely assistant to help her track down the source."

Wonder who that assistant is... possibly a certain young officer who is destined to be captain of the Enterprise one day?

Of course, we have never seen the canon first meeting of Kirk and Uhura before, so this is quite a monumental moment in Star Trek history. (And yes, we know we did see them meet in 2009's Star Trek movie, but that was a different universe!)

Watch our Secret Invasion episode 5 review! Following what has been quite a messy journey so far, episode 5 of Secret Invasion finally lays its cards on the table and brings the rebel Skrulls’ plan into full focus. As a penultimate chapter, ‘Harvest’ does plenty to neaten plot threads and prepare Nick Fury for his final confrontation with Gravik. While all this does fall foul of Secret Invasion’s tendency to suck the excitement out of its best ideas, there’s a better sense of brewing tension this week that builds to a finale that promises a stronger concluding episode.

DISCLAIMER: These interviews took place prior to the SAG-AFTRA strike. 

When was the last time you played with a Barbie? Your instinct may be to laugh this off. Barbies are for kids after all. What Margot Robbie is getting at, however, is the sort of nebulousness of who Barbie really is. More than a doll, she’s come to represent a collection of social norms, pressures and expectations. Ahead of Barbie's release on July 21st, we spoke to Margot Robbie, Issa Rae, Greta Gerwig and more about the massive impact this one doll has had on pop culture. 

From her origins as an offshoot of a German novelty doll to Mattel's current efforts at inclusivity, Barbie's history is a complex one. Greta Gerwig's Barbie recognizes that, examining different perspectives of the doll--whether good or bad. Is she a revolutionary feminist icon that taught girls to dream? Is she a piece of plastic that set toxic beauty standards for decade? Is she both, somehow? Or neither? These are the questions Barbie inspires and, honestly, the answer is never a clear one. We're tackling what Barbie means and how her past can continue shaping our future. 

So let's dig into just how Barbie has always been more than just a toy!

Pikmin 4 reviewed by Jada Griffin on Nintendo Switch

"Like the three wonderfully weird mainline games before it, Pikmin 4 has once again captured my heart with its charming creatures that fearlessly follow commands regardless of their own well-being. The difficulty leaned a bit too much towards the easier side, but all new features like ability upgrades, a pair of new Pikmin, and our loyal sidekick Oatchi add some variety to the traditional gameplay by offering options other than the grab-and-throw Pikmin formula of the past. Coupled with the largest number of enemies to battle, treasures to collect, and awesome post-game content that incorporates some great callbacks to the earlier games, I’m left with not just a positive outlook on Pikmin 4, but the direction the series is heading as a whole."

In today's Daily Fix:
Activision is confirming that a lot of what you may have unlocked in Modern Warfare 2 will carry over into this year's Call of Duty. And, no, they have not confirmed that it's Modern Warfare 3, but it's looking very likely that it is. In related news, Microsoft is working to extend the deadline to purchase Activision Blizzard so that no one else swoops in and tries to buy them. The deadline is today, by the way. In sports news, some gamers are getting pressed that you can have an all-genders team in Electronic Arts' EA Sports FC 24. Specifically in the game's Ultimate Team mode, you can mix and match different players from both men's and women's leagues, with EA explaining that "Ultimate Team is a fantasy." And finally, the upcoming Remnant 2 will be shipping with a 60fps mode for consoles.
