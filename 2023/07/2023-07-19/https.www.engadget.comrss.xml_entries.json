The company has confirmed to Engadget that it's delivering improved IVAS (Integrated Visual Augmentation System) 1.2 devices to the Army before the end of July. These updated augmented reality models are &quot;slimmer, lighter and more balanced&quot; than before, Microsoft says. That, in turn, should make them more comfortable and improve soldiers' performance.</p><p>The Army <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-19/microsoft-is-on-track-to-deliver-improved-goggles-us-army-says?sref=10lNAhZ9\">tells</a><em>Bloomberg</em> two squads will test 20 prototype IVAS goggles in late August. They'll gauge low-light functionality, reliability and whether or not they <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-hololens-fails-us-army-tests-135010970.html\">make soldiers feel ill</a>. Some testers complained last year of nausea, headaches and eye strain, while others weren't happy with the bulk, narrow field of view and a display glow that could give away a soldier's presence at night. Key features also failed relatively frequently.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The HoloLens tech is meant to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-06-us-army-shows-hol\">improve battlefield awareness</a>. Infantry can see each other's positions, get vital health stats and use night vision that's less conspicuous. They can better coordinate assaults and warn if there are signs of injury or fatigue. The technology might reach the field within a few years if the August test is successful. The Army would award a contract between July and September 2024 for a second field study, and could move to an operational combat test as soon as April 2025. The Army could deploy IVAS months afterward.</p><p>Much is riding on this test, however. While the Army could spend as much as $21.9 billion in ten years for up to 121,000 IVAS units, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-hololens-army-combat-goggles-congress-block-202637552.html\">Congress blocked further orders</a> of the earlier goggles in January following reports of problems. Politicians instead gave Microsoft $40 million to rework the hardware. If there are still issues, the Army could cancel the program. It would not only cost Microsoft a lucrative contract, but would cast further doubt on HoloLens itself.

Since you probably won\u2019t need that much often (if ever), there\u2019s a selector that will automatically grind between four and 18 cups worth at the press of a button. <em>\u2014 B.S.</em></p><h2>Fellow Tally</h2><p></p><p>You certainly don\u2019t <em>need</em> to spend a lot on a coffee scale, but some companies throw in extra features that make us reconsider. <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9GZWxsb3ctVGFsbHktU3R1ZGlvLURpZ2l0YWwtQ29mZmVlL2RwL0IwQzY2WUNGSDY_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tM3AtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjRiNjM0NzVkLWU0ZjAtNDIyNi1iYzJkLWEzMGQ5NWY1OTkwZCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAd7yNpuE2H0SSh6K2kZklUywDiaKJCOGie7ocSeZGIOx&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFellow-Tally-Studio-Digital-Coffee%2Fdp%2FB0C66YCFH6\">Fellow\u2019s Tally</a> is a good example of this, combining weight accuracy with a Brew Assist Mode to help dial in the correct ratio <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/fellow-tally-hands-on-a-slick-scale-for-precise-pour-overs-150024886.html\">for perfect pour-overs</a>. There\u2019s also a Timer Mode for more experienced users that only need time and weight info for their brewing process. Tally can be used in Weight Mode as a small kitchen scale that reads out grams, ounces, pounds and milliliters (up to 5.5 lbs).

Goosenecks can be intimidating but they give you much more control when pouring over a Chemex, and we think Cosori\u2019s, with its matte black finish, also looks pretty nice on most countertops. It has a stainless steel interior and five presets so you can easily get the perfect temperature for things like green tea, black coffee and more. Plus, the \u201chold temp\u201d option lets you set and forget the water for a bit; you can turn it on before you start your morning routine and come back to perfectly heated water, ready for whatever\u2019s picking you up that morning. <em>\u2014 Valentina Palladino, Senior Commerce Editor</em></p><h2>BruMate NAV mini</h2><p></p><p>When it comes to travel mugs for coffee and tea, any item worth considering needs to check a few boxes \u2013 especially if you\u2019re giving one as a gift.

The simple, affordable pitcher holds a filter where you load the coarse-ground coffee of your choice. You then fill it with water, give the wet grounds a quick stir and secure the lid. In 8-12 hours, you\u2019ll have delicious cold brew ready for ice and a splash of milk (if that\u2019s your preference). While you can simply remove the filter and serve from the pitcher, it\u2019s not air tight, so you won\u2019t want to use it for days-long storage. There\u2019s also plenty of liquid trapped in the filter when it\u2019s submerged, so you\u2019ll want to let that drain in another container instead of wasting it. <em>\u2014 B.S.</em></p><h2>Fellow Prismo AeroPress attachment</h2><p></p><p>The AeroPress is a versatile brewing device and that\u2019s why we keep it on your coffee gift guide list.

However, its $1,699 sticker price (a mere $1,499 for pre-orders) also allows it to transform your finances for the worse.</p><p>The Grimlock collectible stands 15 inches tall in robot mode and 15.4 inches in dinosaur mode. Robosen describes its auto-transforming as \u201cthe epitome of auto-conversion\u201d while calling the product \u201cthe world\u2019s first dual-form, bipedal walking robot.\u201d (The Optimus Prime version walks as a robot but <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/transformers-optimus-prime-robot-truck-gets-a-transforming-trailer-to-go-with-it-103523411.html\">drives in truck form</a>.)

The collectible includes the original toy\u2019s Energon sword, galaxial rocket launcher, and crown accessories. Robosen and Hasbro even brought back the original voice actor from the G1 animated series, the now 72-year-old Gregg Berger, to record \u201c150+ original Generation 1 Transformers audio lines\u201d for the expensive toy.

And if money truly is no object, you can pair it with the $699 Optimus Prime robot to watch them reenact your favorite classic Transformers battle scenes.

In 2020, <em>Buzzfeed </em>did the same thing with a photo taken by Alexis Hunley of a Black Lives Matter protest. The pair of photogs sued Instagram, alleging that the social media company never asked third parties to obtain a license to embed copyrighted photos or videos, opening them up to a charge of secondary infringement.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The suit was originally initiated in California back in 2021, but a judge dismissed it on the grounds that the news outlets in question didn\u2019t store the original image or even display a copy of it. Rather, it was just displaying what was already available via Instagram as an embed. The pair appealed this decision, which has now failed in federal court. The reasoning follows the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=cc8a75f0-b695-4a6a-a33c-41019f4bfaa4&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Scribd&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjYzhhNzVmMC1iNjk1LTRhNmEtYTMzYy00MTAxOWY0YmZhYTQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2NyaWJkLmNvbS9kb2N1bWVudC82NTk3ODU4MjAvSHVubGV5LUJyYXVlci1JbnN0YWdyYW0tQXBwZWFsIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyNTc3ZmFmNC02NWYxLTRkMTgtOGIzMS1jZDU3OWFiZTZkYWIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAY-0x8M71cUg3wGZPv38IvH_ntW1D1PBqknCl5tPNUFI&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fdocument%2F659785820%2FHunley-Brauer-Instagram-Appeal\"><ins>same line as California\u2019s decision,</ins></a> with judges agreeing that when a photo or video is embedded, no copy is made of the underlying content.</p><p>It\u2019s worth noting, however, that the federal panel of judges did say that Hunley and Brauer raised \u201cserious and well-argued\u201d policy concerns regarding copyright holders\u2019 ability to actually control and ultimately profit from their work. Instagram has also addressed the issue in convening years, adding an option in 2021 that allows users to make images unembeddable. This change came after the platform was lobbied by the American Society of Media Photographers (ASMP) and the National Press Photographers Association (NPPA).</p><p>This may not be the end of the case, as <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/column-instagram-dodges-photographers-copyright-claims-appeal-case-likely-2023-07-18/\"><em><ins>Reuters </ins></em><ins>reports</ins></a> that the photographers can petition for a rehearing with a panel of 11 randomly-selected judges, though Brauer and Hunley haven\u2019t addressed this course of action.</p><p>There\u2019s also the underlying meaning of this court decision. All by itself, the ruling indicates that third parties, such as media publications, can embed photos and videos at will without ever asking the original content creator for permission. However, related cases have been popping up with differing outcomes, setting the stage for a higher-court showdown at some point.</p><p>For instance, a New York judge handed down a <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/judge-rules-news-publishers-violated-copyright-by-embedding-tweets-tom-brady-photo-1085342/\"><ins>somewhat contradictory ruling</ins></a> back in 2018 when a photographer sued various publications after they embedded tweets with an original image of NFL legend Tom Brady. The judge sided with the photographer here, stating in her decision that \u201cthe fact that the image was hosted on a server owned and operated by an unrelated third party does not shield them from this result,\u201d adding \u201cnowhere does the Copyright Act suggest that possession of an image is necessary in order to display it. Indeed, the purpose and language of the Act support the opposite view.\u201d</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/instagram-beats-copyright-infringement-lawsuit-involving-embedded-photos-170547770.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/instagram-beats-copyright-infringement-lawsuit-involving-embedded-photos-170547770.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-19T17:05:47+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Nothing Phone 2 review: An offbeat alternative to boring midrange phones", "description": "<p>Being a smartphone startup is hard, particularly when you\u2019re up against tech giants like Apple, Google and Samsung.

And while it looks similar to the previous model, it feels like Nothing is finally figuring out its groove. Not only does it have a significantly faster CPU, its cameras have been improved, and we\u2019re finally seeing Nothing\u2019s vision of a more thoughtful and deliberate UI. Even the phone\u2019s most distinctive feature \u2013 its Glyph interface \u2013 offers enhanced customization and added functionality. But perhaps most importantly, the Phone 2 will officially be available in the US. And while this added sophistication comes at an increased cost, it\u2019s still very affordable at $600. In a sea of Android phones that often blend together, getting an eye-catching device for a reasonable price is definitely something notable.</p><h2>Design</h2><p>Compared to most phones that are clad in a blank sheet of glass, the Phone 2 (which is available in white or a new gray color) is a stunner. Its transparent Gorilla Glass back reveals a monotone assortment of components, allowing you to see things like its magnetic charging coil, power cables and more. It\u2019s not messy, though. Everything is buttoned up just enough, and there are human touches like arranging some of the components to look like an elephant. I\u2019ve been told there are other creatures hiding as well, but I haven\u2019t spotted them yet. It\u2019s like having a cyberpunk art installation in your pocket.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p></p><p>Of course, there\u2019s also the Glyph interface which consists of a number of LED strips that pulse, strobe and glow. For this model, Nothing more than doubled the number of lights from five to 11, while also adding support for addressable zones, which allows for gradient effects. Unfortunately, there\u2019s still only one color to choose from: white.</p><p>As for the rest of the device, it\u2019s very similar to the Phone 1 including a metal frame with flat boxy sides and an iPhone-like button layout for power and volume. The one big change is that Nothing used 2.5D glass with rounded edges in back which sports curves that sit more naturally in your hand without digging in.</p><figure><img alt=\"Thanks to its OS 2.0, Nothing is finally showing its vision of a more thoughtful smartphone UI.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/1495a290-263f-11ee-8dfe-84406d7c1cad\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Meanwhile, its 6.7-inch OLED display delivers excellent brightness (with peaks of well over 1,000 nits in my testing), rich colors and a speedy 120Hz refresh rate. You also get an in-screen fingerprint reader for simple and secure biometrics which is both fast and accurate.</p><h2>Performance</h2><h2></h2><p>The Phone 2 packs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 processor, 8GB or 12GB of RAM and up to 512GB of storage. Sure, its chip is a year old, but it handled games and editing photos without a hint of lag. When combined with speedy UI animations and a lightweight Android skin, the Phone 2 feels incredibly responsive and snappier than some flagship phones that cost a whole lot more. Additionally, while the phone is only available as an unlocked model, it has been certified to work on both T-Mobile and AT&amp;T\u2019s networks (sorry Verizon folk), so it\u2019s pretty flexible when it comes to bringing it over to your carrier.</p><h2>Cameras</h2><figure><img alt=\"After finding success with the Phone 1 last year, Nothing is back with a new model in the Phone 2.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/9a59a1d0-263d-11ee-bff7-aa2c13e1e571\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Tuning a phone\u2019s cameras and image processing can be extremely difficult when you don\u2019t have the same level of resources as a trillion-dollar megacorp. And while the Phone 2\u2019s 50MP main cam and 50MP ultra-wide cams are decent, they\u2019re still a tier or two below what you get from a Pixel 7. During the day, the Phone 2 captures images with bright, rich colors and good sharpness. It\u2019s only when you zoom to 100 percent that you notice things like color fringing and worse dynamic range. Nothing has a hard time keeping up with Google\u2019s Night Sight mode in low light too, sometimes struggling when trying to nail white balance while also preserving detail. Still, coming from the Phone 1, it\u2019s a big improvement and if you aren\u2019t an avid photographer, the Phone 2 is still serviceable.</p><h2>Software</h2><p>Compared to the previous model, the Phone 2\u2019s software may have the biggest number of improvements. This time instead of a barebones version of stock Android, Nothing has included its Monochrome UI which consists of new widgets, wallpapers, icon packs and more that create a distinctive experience that ties into the phone's exterior design. Not only does it look great, you can also make all the app icons grayscale and even remove the name of the app entirely. The idea is that, by making apps a touch harder to find, you\u2019re forced to be more deliberate about how and when you use your phone. That\u2019s a refreshing change from just reflexively doom scrolling through social media every time you have a spare minute.</p><p>Nothing also added a new tab in the settings menu for its Glyph interface so you can get more granular control over all those LEDs. Features range from simple things like using its rear lights to show battery status or volume to more sophisticated things like what Nothing calls \u201cEssential notifications.\u201d That allows you to set specific apps to activate LEDs on the back of the phone. This way, you can put the phone facedown on a table and really pay attention to the people you're with. This was convenient for me because since my wife and I seem to be the only people we know that use Google Chat, I set that as my essential notification so I never miss her messages.</p><p>And while it\u2019s limited to a single app for now, Nothing is even integrating its Glyph interface with a third-party app in Uber, so you can see a real-time arrival estimate for a car just by looking at the back of the phone. It\u2019s a neat trick that could have a ton of potential. Instead of using a special API, the LEDs are simply getting info from your notifications to update the lights. That makes it easier to develop more custom Glyph integrations without needing to partner with every single app developer. So while third-party app integration is still a work in development, it\u2019s off to an interesting start.</p><p>Finally, while it\u2019s not quite as long as what you get from Google or Samsung, Nothing is promising three years of OS updates along with four years of regular security patches.</p><h2>Battery Life</h2><figure><img alt=\"The bottom of the Phone 2 features a USB-C port for data and charging. Though you can also rely on wireless charging to add more juice as well. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/56e8b330-263f-11ee-99b9-fa457b6fe0a4\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>I wasn\u2019t sure what kind of endurance I was going to get from the Phone 2 between its 4,700 mAh battery and slightly older, less power-efficient chip. But on our video rundown test, Nothing crushed it with a time of 24 hours and 25 minutes. That\u2019s the second longest time we\u2019ve seen in recent history, only behind the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s23-review-a-solid-phone-thats-probably-not-worth-the-upgrade-173026346.html\">Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S23+</a> (25:02). On top of that you get 15-watt wireless charging, 45-watt wired charging and 5-watt reverse wireless charging.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>In a time when new generations of phones never seem quite as exciting as the last, Nothing has still managed to make the Phone 2 stand out. Its eye-catching design captures some of the best qualities of clear plastic gadgets from the \u201890s, like Gameboys and Nintendo 64\u2019s, but in a much more sophisticated way. Meanwhile, Nothing\u2019s Monochrome UI asks users to be more thoughtful about how they use their device while giving them tools like the Glyph interface that can surface info and notifications in novel ways. And even though its specs don\u2019t jump out at you, it never felt slow and it\u2019s well-equipped with handy features like reverse wireless charging.</p><figure><img alt=\"By adding addressable LEDs to the back of the Phone 2, Nothing can use its Glyph interface to show things like charging status or as a countdown timer. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/a51f2160-263f-11ee-b77f-29f982531141\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>That said, for $600, the Pixel 7 is still the better value. It\u2019s got a newer chip along with a much more sophisticated software package which includes features like Call Screener and robust language detection, and its cameras are in a class of their own. But its screen is smaller and its battery life isn\u2019t quite as long. And you know what, that\u2019s totally fine because the Phone 2 isn\u2019t for everyone. It\u2019s a phone that wants you to think differently about how you use your device while giving you the tools to do so. It\u2019s the offbeat choice, and for people who want to be excited by their phone again, it\u2019s definitely an interesting mainstream alternative.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/nothing-phone-2-review-an-offbeat-alternative-to-boring-midrange-phones-specs-price-160002218.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/nothing-phone-2-review-an-offbeat-alternative-to-boring-midrange-phones-specs-price-160002218.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-19T16:00:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Activision Blizzard lays off around 50 esports staff amid a potential Overwatch League overhaul", "description": "<p>Amid the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-and-activision-extend-the-deadline-for-their-687-billion-merger-to-october-18th-132138900.html\"><ins>pending takeover of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft</ins></a>, the former has laid off around 50 employees from its esports division.

Earlier this year, esports journalist Jacob Wolf <a href=\"https://www.jacobwolf.report/p/overwatch-league-teams-start-collective\"><ins>reported</ins></a> that OWL teams brought in a law firm to negotiate with Activision Blizzard for some kind of economic relief &quot;after years of high operating costs and continually missed promises on revenue.&quot; <em>Sports Business Journal</em><a href=\"https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/SB-Blogs/Newsletter-Esports/2023/01/19.aspx\"><ins>noted</ins></a> that teams receive around $1 million from OWL but it costs between $3 million and $5 million a year to run a competitive team, meaning that most are running at a loss.</p><p>Given the financial implications, it would not be surprising if OWL teams vote to end their agreement with the league. While that would certainly end the Overwatch League in its current format, Activision Blizzard is still planning to support Overwatch esports.</p><p>\u201cI want to be clear on one thing in particular, that Overwatch remains committed to a competitive ecosystem in 2024 and beyond,\u201d OWL commissioner Sean Miller told <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/19/23799550/activision-blizzard-esports-layoffs-overwatch-league-owl\"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a>. \u201cAnd we\u2019re building toward a revitalized global scene that prioritizes players and fans.\u201d Miller noted that Blizzard was looking at various options for the future of Overwatch esports and added he was very optimistic: &quot;We are doing all we can to make the player experience and the fan experience one that people want to return to, want to be a part of and get excited about to turn on.\u201d</p><p>All the same, the Overwatch esports ecosystem could look very different next year. This year's Grand Finals in Toronto could be the end of OWL as we know it.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-lays-off-around-50-esports-staff-amid-a-potential-overwatch-league-overhaul-152039688.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-lays-off-around-50-esports-staff-amid-a-potential-overwatch-league-overhaul-152039688.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-19T15:20:39+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The best mobile gaming controllers for 2023", "description": "<p>Mobile gaming is serious business now.

They have shoulder buttons and triggers, the d-pad is the same, and they both include sturdy phone mounts for attaching your device at the top \u2014  the type that clamps in place automatically. Unlike a clamp from a more generic company, the one SteelSeries provides with both controllers won\u2019t fight you during the process of mounting your phone.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> More players are likely to be familiar with Xbox-style controllers; both models include sturdy clamps for clipping your phone to the controller.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> You have to buy a different controller based on what OS you\u2019re using; the controller with the clamp attached is unwieldy</p><h2>For players who want to turn their Android phone into a Switch or Steam Deck-like device: Razer Kishi</h2><p></p><p>Let\u2019s be honest, the form factor is a big reason that devices like the Switch are so popular.

My colleague Mat Smith was a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/backbone-one-ios-gamepad-review-143015385.html\">big fan</a> of the One when he tried it, and in my own use it has a few advantages over the Razer device, namely a cleaner design and a more sweat-friendly matte texture.

But for everyone else, it\u2019s definitely worth a look, if only because it\u2019s so small there\u2019s no reason to keep it on you at all times in case of an emergency. Not that we could tell you what constitutes a gaming emergency, but if one does come up you\u2019ll be glad to have this on hand. It truly is keychain-sized, so you can clip it on your backpack or slide it into a Switch carrying case with ease.

A second-generation version of Beats\u2019 own audio chip powers this new model, delivering improvements to active noise cancellation (ANC), spatial audio with dynamic head tracking and wired audio modes via USB-C connection. Small design tweaks and slightly better battery life are also on the spec sheet, while the price remains $350 for Beats\u2019 flagship headphones.</p><h2>Design</h2><p>To refresh the aesthetics, Beats enlisted the help of Samuel Ross, a fashion and product designer who has worked with Hublot, Nike, Oakley and others. The result is an updated look with new colors, materials, packaging and branding. While the tweaks are subtle and the folding design remains the same overall, there are a few notable changes to point out. First, Studio Pro is available in four new colors and even the black option now has a matte finish. Where the headband hinge used to have a contrasting color for most of the variants, that\u2019s now a tone-on-tone finish and the model name has been removed. The iconic lowercase \u201cb\u201d logo remains on both sides, though.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p></p><p>Another key change is to the earpads. Beats and Ross opted for a seamless design here, with cushions made of a new UltraPlush memory foam, though they\u2019re still wrapped in leather. Beats is clear the clamping force from previous Beats models remains the same, unfortunately and the weight hasn\u2019t changed. Indeed, the new ear pads help to a degree, but after about an hour of use, I start to feel the pressure that\u2019s been an issue with Beats headphones for years.</p><p>Since Beats headphones first debuted, the company\u2019s models have become mainstays for gym goers and pro athletes. You won\u2019t catch warm-ups for many professional sports events without at least one person wearing Beats headphones. Still, the company hasn\u2019t issued a proper IP rating for sweat and water resistance. Beats says it\u2019s confident the Studio Pro will be just fine for workouts, but it\u2019s also clear that earpad replacements won\u2019t be available through the company. You\u2019ll need to find a third-party supplier should they get too grimey.</p><p>Physical on-board controls are back on the Studio Pro. On the outside of the left ear cup, a multi-function button in the center handles single, double and triple taps to control music and calls. A long press here will activate your voice assistant, even though the headphones support hands-free Siri on Apple devices. Above and below this center button are the volume controls, while the noise modes are toggled with a double press of the power button on the right ear cup. If you\u2019re in USB-C audio mode, two taps of that button will cycle between three EQ presets specifically designed for wired use (Signature, Entertainment and Conversation). A line of five LEDs below the power control blinks when you\u2019re in pairing mode and gives you a battery life estimate with a single press when the headphones are powered on.</p><h2>Software and features</h2><figure><img alt=\"Beats Studio Pro review\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/289dd5b0-25a8-11ee-b33f-beeb55b5cc55\" style=\"height: 1333px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Beats continues its move away from Apple\u2019s audio chips with the Studio Pro. These headphones contain the company\u2019s own second-gen platform instead, but a lot of the features that Apple silicon offers are still here. Hands-free Siri, one-touch pairing, iCloud pairing, Apple Watch hand-off and Find My compatibility are all baked into iOS. Multipoint pairing and automatic switching between devices isn\u2019t available on iOS, iPad and Mac right now, but Beats says it may arrive later. There\u2019s no need to download a separate app on iOS to access the settings though, they\u2019re also available in the Control Center. For Android users, the Beats app offers one-touch pairing via Google Fast Pair, automatic connection to Android or Chrome devices through your Google account, seamless device transitions, Find My Device, customization and widgets.</p><p>Beats has added Transparency Mode to the Studio Pro, giving its over-ear headphones a very useful tool that was missing from the Studio 3. The company\u2019s audio chip also powers Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking. While the previous model supported immersive sound, it didn\u2019t offer head tracking or the ability to personalize audio, the latter of which Apple debuted last year.</p><p>For the first time, Beats has enabled USB-C wired audio on the Studio Pro. In addition to listening to high-resolution and lossless tunes, you can also take calls while the headphones are actively charging. The Studio Pro has a built-in digital-to-analog converter (DAC) that can accommodate sample rates up to 24-bit/48kHz. That\u2019s enough to handle the high-res streaming from Apple Music, Amazon Music HD and Tidal. Beats has also included three USB-C sounds profiles for wired listening: Signature, Entertainment and Conversation. As the names suggest, each one is tailored to music, movies/TV shows and calls, adjusting the frequency curve for what the company thinks is the best in each scenario. And yes, there\u2019s still 3.5mm playback, which can be used with ANC and Transparency Mode as needed.</p><h2>Sound quality</h2><p></p><figure><img alt=\"Beats Studio Pro review\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/289ceb50-25a8-11ee-bb63-cd3eb3ed509d\" style=\"height: 1333px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Inside, Beats swapped out the drivers for new 40mm units. A two-layer diaphragm combines with micro vents and fine acoustic mesh to streamline the airflow and minimize distortion. The company says the new drivers can provide \u201cnear-zero\u201d distortion even at high volumes, which is an up to 80 percent improvement from the Studio 3. That claim holds true as the Studio Pro doesn\u2019t distort when you crank it up to the eye-watering full volume. However, what the new components have done to improve clarity while providing a more balanced sound profile is more impressive.</p><p>In its early days, Beats had a reputation for being too heavy-handed with the bass. While that hasn\u2019t been the case for a while, the company still has a propensity to highlight low-end. For the Studio Pro, there\u2019s still ample bass when a track calls for it, but that boom doesn\u2019t come at the sacrifice of mids and highs \u2013 or more importantly detail. Even the driving thump of the kick drum on TesseracT\u2019s \u201cWar of Being\u201d has noticeable texture throughout the song. It\u2019s not just a repetitive boom.</p><p>Overall, the attention to clarity and the even-handed tuning across the EQ curve gives the Studio Pro quite immersive sound out of the box. Everything seems open and airy, with even the instruments in chaotic metal tracks remaining perfectly discernible. Turn on something softer like Charles Wesley Godwin\u2019s <em>Live From The Church </em>or Nickel Creek\u2019s <em>Celebrants </em>(country and bluegrass, respectively), and you immediately hear the layers of acoustic instruments and finer detail unique to each. Those records can sound like you\u2019re in the room while they\u2019re being recorded on the best-sounding headphones, and there\u2019s a sense of that on the Studio Pro. As you might expect, this latest Beats model excels with hip-hop tracks. The droning bass lines on albums like Killer Mike\u2019s <em>MICHAEL </em>lay a thick foundation for the rest of the song to be built.</p><p>While Spatial Audio returns, chances are it won\u2019t sway your buying decision. The integration is similar to previous Beats and Apple earbuds and headphones, with Personalized Spatial Audio added in this time around. The technology still simulates the sound of 64 speakers, capable of moving with you if you have head tracking enabled. If you\u2019ve experienced Spatial Audio before, you know exactly what to expect: slightly louder, more airy tunes where the technology\u2019s immersive nature can vary from album to album and genre to genre. When it hits though, like on Pearl Jam\u2019s \u201cEven Flow,\u201d older tracks have new life. With boygenius\u2019 <em>The Record </em>though, I can\u2019t tell the difference when Spatial Audio is on. I\u2019m also less sold on the dynamic head tracking Beats added on the Studio Pro.</p><figure><img alt=\"Beats Studio Pro review\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/289d1260-25a8-11ee-9fd7-e6929aa9ec87\" style=\"height: 1333px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Then there are the new USB-C EQ profiles. When you\u2019re connected to a computer or other compatible device, ANC and Transparency mode are disabled. Instead, the power button on the Studio Pro cycles through wired presets for music, entertainment and calls. That 5-LED array below the power control indicates which profile you\u2019re on and will be essential until you memorize the audible tones for each one. Signature and Conversation work best for music and calls respectively, while I\u2019m less impressed by the Entertainment setting. All three are fine, but those two are the ones I found myself coming back to in wired mode. Like Spatial Audio content in Dolby Atmos, mileage can vary listening to lossless tunes via Apple Music. Some albums are noticeably better with wired USB-C, while others sound nearly identical to streaming over Bluetooth.</p><p>Although Beats doesn\u2019t quantify with a number, it says ANC performance is improved on the Studio Pro when compared to the Studio 3. Fully adaptive active noise cancellation uses outward facing mics to monitor your environment while inward pointing units catch any sounds that might sneak through due to fit. The company explains that the ANC boost is also partially due to updated microphones all around as they have higher sensitivity and a better signal-to-noise ratio. While the Studio Pro doesn\u2019t beat the noise-blocking powers of Bose or Sony, the ANC on the Studio Pro is noticeably better than the Studio 3 \u2013 especially for things like television noise and human voices. And similar to the previous model, the latest Beats headphones analyze audio up to 48,000 times per second to maintain pristine clarity.</p><p>Lastly, let\u2019s discuss Transparency Mode. While I welcome the inclusion here over not offering ambient sound at all, I did have higher hopes. It works fine, but lacks the natural clarity of Apple\u2019s AirPods Max or AirPods Pro. I thought Beats might come close since it works closely with Apple on several aspects of its products, but that\u2019s not the case. Apple remains truly unmatched when it comes to Transparency Mode. It often sounds like you\u2019re not even wearing headphones at all, mostly due to how natural your own voice sounds fed back through those devices.</p><h2>Call quality</h2><figure><img alt=\"Beats Studio Pro review\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/289d1261-25a8-11ee-bfff-17bab451462a\" style=\"height: 1333px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Beats says you can expect up to 27 percent better voice clarity than the Studio 3 Wireless, thanks to voice-targeting microphones and a machine-learning algorithm. The company explains that it trained the system on over 7,000 hours of \u201creal-world environments\u201d in order to create a setup that can \u201cprecisely hone in\u201d on your voice. Those are lofty claims for sure, and part of them hold true.</p><p>The Studio Pro is great at cutting out constant background noise, like a fan or A/C unit. Neither of those came through on calls when I was sitting right underneath one or the other. It\u2019s better than the speakerphone-like quality most headphones and earbuds offer, but it isn\u2019t pristine.</p><h2>Battery life</h2><p>When it comes to battery life, Beats says you can expect up to 40 hours with ANC off. That\u2019s the same figure it promised on the Studio 3. However, with noise cancellation or Transparency Mode enabled, the company offers two hours more than the previous model at 24 hours. There\u2019s still a quick-charge feature here, dubbed Fast Fuel, that gives you up to four hours of use in just 10 minutes.</p><p>During my tests with the Studio Pro, I still had 23 percent battery left after 25 hours of use with either ANC or ambient sound active. That\u2019s also doing a mix of music, podcasts, streaming TV and taking calls. I powered the headphones completely off several times during that span as well and I plugged them in via USB-C for a few minutes to test those modes.</p><h2>The competition</h2><figure><img alt=\"Beats Studio Pro review\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/289e4ae0-25a8-11ee-9f7a-3d8f68c11a76\" style=\"height: 1333px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>When it comes to flagship headphones at this price, Beats\u2019 biggest competition remains Sony and Bose. Sony\u2019s 1000X line has been our top pick for <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-headphones-150030794.html\">best wireless headphones</a> for years, as the company\u2019s mix of stellar sound, powerful noise cancellation and a literal truckload of handy features is unmatched. With the latest version, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh-1000xm5-review-160045478.html\">the $400 WH-1000XM5</a>, the company simply packs so much into their headphones that many others can\u2019t compete. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-16-bose-700-headphones-review.html\">The Bose 700</a> is that company\u2019s best option, which is currently available for about $10 less than Sony\u2019s 1000XM5. Bose doesn\u2019t come close to Sony in terms of features, but it does do slightly better when it comes to ANC performance. If blocking out distractions is your primary goal, the 700 is worth a look.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>While Beats didn\u2019t completely redesign its over-ear headphones for the Studio Pro, its latest model is a significant update. The company did well to incorporate features and technology other companies have introduced over the last five years, and its relationship with Apple continues to enhance its products. The improvements to ANC and sound quality alone are good, but the fact that the company was also able to add in a wired USB-C audio, upgrades to Spatial Audio and better voice performance while keeping the price the same is notable. There\u2019s no doubt these are still premium headphones, but the Studio Pro positions Beats to better compete with the likes of Sony and Bose in a number of areas where it used to fall short.</p><p>Beats Studio Pro is available to order today in black, brown, navy and Sandstone color options for $350. The headphones will be available at Apple retail stores and other resellers starting tomorrow, July 20th.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-pro-review-upgraded-sound-makes-all-the-difference-140058369.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-pro-review-upgraded-sound-makes-all-the-difference-140058369.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-19T14:00:58+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Lexar's SD cards and storage gear are up to 52 percent off right now", "description": "<p>Amazon's Prime Day sale on Lexar storage is still going on, with <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kZWFsL2Y4MzViMDExP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTFxMy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMDMwOTQ4YjEtNGI2ZC00ODUyLWI4ZWMtYjNmNTMxY2M3YzM3In0&amp;signature=AQAAAcvKHhjdkNMlZR2GuiFiDGDD6luXCDDypaZrWz7gMOtG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdeal%2Ff835b011\">deals now available</a> to non-Prime members as well.

Sensing her profound sadness, Jamie returns as a ghost to help her process her loss. If you\u2019ve seen the film, you\u2019ll know that his reappearance forces her to question her memory of him and, in turn, accept that maybe he wasn\u2019t as perfect as she\u2019d remembered. Here in 2023, a new wave of AI-based \u201cgrief tech\u201d offers us all the chance to spend time with loved ones after their death \u2014 in varying forms. But unlike Jamie (who benevolently misleads Nina), we\u2019re being asked to let artificial intelligence serve up a version of those we survive. What could possibly go wrong?</p><p>While generative tools like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/openai-improves-chatgpt-privacy-with-new-data-controls-174851274.html\">ChatGPT</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/midjourney-ends-free-trials-of-its-ai-image-generator-due-to-extraordinary-abuse-153853905.html\">Midjourney</a> are dominating the AI conversation, we\u2019re broadly ignoring the larger ethical questions around topics like grief and mourning. The Pope in a puffa is cool, after all, but thinking about your loved ones after death? Not so much. If you believe generative AI avatars for the dead are still a way out, you\u2019d be wrong. At least one company is offering digital immortality already - and it\u2019s as costly as it is eerie.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p><a href=\"https://rememory.deepbrainai.io/en\">Re;memory</a>, for example, is a service offered by Deepbrain AI - a company whose main business includes those \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMfDxsdVk3c\">virtual assistant</a>\u201d type interactive screens along with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ckWjVRhuWE\">AI news anchors</a>. The Korean firm took its experience with marrying chatbots and generative AI video to its ultimate, macabre conclusion. For just $10,000 dollars and a few hours in a studio, you can create an avatar of yourself that your family can visit (an additional cost) at an offsite facility. Deepbrain is based in Korea, and Korean mourning traditions include \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesa\">Jesa</a>\u201d, an annual visit to the departed\u2019s resting place.</p><div id=\"ef07795d0de94050a05c93ca052e0eee\"></div><p>Right now, even by the company\u2019s own admission, the service doesn\u2019t claim to replicate their personality with too much depth - the training set only really affords the avatar to have one \u201cmood.\u201d Michael Jung, Business Development and Strategy Lead at Deepbrain told Engadget, \u201cIf I want to be a very entertaining Michael, then I have to read very hyper voices or entertaining voices for 300 lines. Then every time when I input the text [to the avatar] I'm going to have a very exciting Michael\u201d. Re;memory isn\u2019t currently trying to create a true facsimile of the subject - it\u2019s something you can visit occasionally and have basic interactions with - but one hopes there's a little more character to them than a virtual hotel receptionis.</p><p>While Re;memory has the added benefit of being a video avatar that can respond to your questions, audio-based <a href=\"https://www.hereafter.ai/\">HereAfter AI</a> tries to capture a little more of your personality with a series of questions.The result is an audio chatbot that friends and family can interact with, receiving verbal answers and even stories and anecdotes from the past. By all accounts, the pre-trained chatbots provide convincing answers in their owners\u2019 voices - until the illusion is unceremoniously broken when it robotically responds \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t understand that. You can try asking another way, or move onto another topic.\u201d to any query it doesn't have an answer for.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether these technologies create a realistic avatar or not isn\u2019t the primary concern - AI is moving at such a clip that <a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2022/11/gpt-3-can-talk-like-dennett-without.html\">it\u2019ll certainly improve</a>. The trickier questions revolve around who owns this avatar once you\u2019re gone? Or are your memories and data safe and secure? And what impact can all this have on those we leave behind anyway?</p><p>Joanna Bryson, Professor of Ethics and Technology at Hertie School of Governance likens the current wave of grief tech to when Facebook was more popular with young people. Back then, it was a common destination to memorialize friends that had passed and the emotional impact of this was striking. \u201cIt was such a new, immediate form of communication, that kids couldn't believe they were gone. And they seriously believe that they're dead friends were reading it. And they're like, \u2018I know, you're seeing this.\u2019\u201d</p><figure><img alt=\"In this photo illustration a virtual friend is seen on the screen of an iPhone on  April 30, 2020, in Arlington, Virginia. - \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/589ed540-255b-11ee-b7cf-25e76407fbff\" style=\"height: 3226px; width: 4969px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">OLIVIER DOULIERY via Getty Images</div></figure><p>The inherent extra dimension that AI avatars bring only adds fuel to the concern about the impact these creations might have on our grieving brains. \u201cWhat does it do to your life, that you're spending your time remembering \u2026 maybe it's good to have some time to process it for a while. But it can turn into an unhealthy obsession.\u201d</p><p>Bryson also thinks this same technology could start being used in ways it wasn\u2019t originally intended. \u201cWhat if you\u2019re a teenager or preteen and you spend all your time on the phone with your best friend. And then you figure out you prefer, like a [AI] synthesis of your best friend and Justin Bieber or something. And you stop talking to your actual best friend,\u201d she said.</p><p>Of course, that scenario is beyond current capabilities. Not least because to create an AI version of our best, living friend we\u2019d need so much data that we\u2019d need their participation/consent in the process. But this might not be the case for much longer. The recent spate of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/copyright-in-spotlight-after-streaming-platforms-pull-ai-generated-drake-song-183513972.html\">fake AI songs</a> in the style of famous artists is already possible, and it won\u2019t be long before you won\u2019t need to be a celebrity for there to be enough publicly available input to feed a generative AI. Microsoft\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsofts-vall-e-ai-can-simulate-any-persons-voice-from-a-short-audio-sample-112520213.html\">VALL-E</a>, for example, can already do a decent job of cloning a voice with just three seconds of source material.</p><p>If you have ever had the misfortune of sorting through the possessions of a dead relative, you often learn things about them you never knew. Maybe it was their fondness for a certain type of poetry via their underlinings in a book. Or maybe something more sinister, like bank statements that showed crippling debt. We all have details that make us complex, complete human beings. Details that, often intentionally, remain hidden from our public persona. This throws up another time-honored ethical conundrum.</p><p>The internet is awash with stories of parents and loved ones seeking access to their deceased\u2019s email or messaging accounts <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/tech-industry/yahoo-denies-family-access-to-dead-marines-e-mail/\">to remember them by</a>. For better or worse we may not feel comfortable telling our immediate family about our sexuality or our politics, or that our spouse was having an affair - all things that our private digital messages might reveal. And if we\u2019re not careful, this could be data we inadvertently give over to AI for training, only for it to burp that secret out posthumously.</p><p>Even with the consent of the person being recreated in AI there are no assurances someone else can\u2019t get their hands on the digital version of you and abuse it. And right now, that broadly falls into the same crime bucket as someone stealing your credit card details. Until they do something public with it, at which point other laws, such as <a href=\"https://www.inta.org/topics/right-of-publicity/\">right to publicity</a> may apply - but usually, these protections are only for the living.</p><p>Bryson suggests that the logical answer for data protection might be something we\u2019re already familiar with \u2013 like the locally stored biometric data we use to <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MTMwZTJmMC1hMTRmLTRjNWUtYmRhYi1jZDUyYWM3ZDhlNzkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL2xlZ2FsL3ByaXZhY3kvZGF0YS9lbi9mYWNlLWlkLyM6fjp0ZXh0PUZhY2UlMjBJRCUyMGRhdGElMjBkb2VzJTIwbm90LHRvJTIwaUNsb3VkJTIwb3IlMjBhbnl3aGVyZSUyMGVsc2UuJnRleHQ9SWYlMjB5b3UlMjBjaG9vc2UlMjB0byUyMGVucm9sbCxkaXNhYmxlJTIwaXQlMjBhdCUyMGFueSUyMHRpbWUuIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhODNjYTYyMS02ZjFhLTQzODMtOGVhNS1iNzFhMGUwNzgwNWYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAXY4bk9Wj8T7W45m0SFkZXCfDgvmfwZ2G3vV91MmI2xu&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Flegal%2Fprivacy%2Fdata%2Fen%2Fface-id%2F%23%3A%7E%3Atext%3DFace%2520ID%2520data%2520does%2520not%2Cto%2520iCloud%2520or%2520anywhere%2520else.%26text%3DIf%2520you%2520choose%2520to%2520enroll%2Cdisable%2520it%2520at%2520any%2520time.\">unlock our phones</a>. \u201cApple has never trusted anyone. So they really are very privacy oriented. So I tend to think that, that's the kind of organization that will come up with stuff, because they want it themselves.\u201d (The main issue this way, as Bryson points out, is that if your house burns down you risk losing \u201cgrandma\u201d forever.)</p><figure><img alt=\"Front view portrait of a sad teenager complaining in a bar in the night\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-06/92207900-8653-11e9-a6f6-859bfc06d7d3\" style=\"height: 3708px; width: 5562px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">AntonioGuillem via Getty Images</div></figure><p>Data will always be at risk, no matter where or how it\u2019s stored. It\u2019s a peril of modern day living. And all those concerns about privacy might feel like a tomorrow problem (in the same way we tend to worry about online fraud only once it\u2019s happened to us). The cost, accuracy and just general creepiness that AI and our future digital avatars create might be scary, but it\u2019s also a crushing inevitability. But that doesn\u2019t mean our future is doomed to be an ocean of Max Headroom\u2019s spouting our innermost secrets to any hacker that will listen.</p><p>\u201cIt will be a problem in the immediate, there probably is a problem already,\u201d Bryson said. \u201cBut I would hope that a good high quality version would have transparency, and you'd be able to check it. And I'm sure that Bing and Google are working on this now, for being able to verify where chat programmes get their ideas from.\u201d Until that time though, we\u2019re at risk of finding out <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/07/16/racist-robots-ai/\">the hard way</a>.</p><p>Bryson is keen to point out that there are some positive takeaways, and they\u2019re available to the living. \u201cIf you make it too much about death, you aren't thinking correctly about it,\u201d she said. This technology forces us to confront our mortality in a new, albeit curious way and that can only help us think about the relationships we have right here in the world of the living. An AI version of someone will always be a poor facsimile, so, as Bryson suggests, why not get to know the real person better while you can. \u201cI wish people would rehearse conversations with a chatbot and then talk to a real person and find out what the differences are.\u201d</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/digital-immortality-is-coming-and-were-not-ready-for-it-133022423.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/digital-immortality-is-coming-and-were-not-ready-for-it-133022423.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-19T13:30:22+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Microsoft and Activision extend the deadline for their $68.7 billion merger to October 18th", "description": "<p>After 18 months of battling their way through regulatory red tape, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/microsoft/\">Microsoft</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/activision-blizzard/\">Activision Blizzard</a> are closer than ever to making their merger happen.

The company has updated its Plans and Pricing page to say that new and rejoining members in the US and the UK will no longer be able to sign up for the Basic tier. Meanwhile, those already on the plan can keep their membership as is until they cancel or change their subscription. The streaming giant initially <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/netflix-is-removing-its-basic-plan-in-canada-092535002.html\">axed the tier in Canada</a>, where users are typically the first to experience changes to the service. It was also one of the countries where Netflix started its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/netflix-account-sharing-rollout-countries-202340036.html\">password-sharing crackdown</a>, which the company eventually implemented across the globe.&nbsp;</p><p>As <a href=\"https://www.cordbusters.co.uk/netflix-pricing-basic-tier-axed-uk-us/\"><em>Cord Busters</em></a> notes, Netflix has been steering its audiences towards the Standard Ad-Supported plan for a while now and has previously made the Basic plan virtually invisible during sign-up. Now, the Basic plan truly no longer exists in some regions. Without it, users in the US and UK will have to pay at least $15.49 and \u00a311 a month, respectively, if they don't want their streaming experience to be interrupted by ads. The Standard plan supports streaming on two devices at a time and can stream content in Full HD. It also allows users to download content for offline viewing on two devices and gives them the ability to add an extra member who doesn't live with them for an additional fee.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Still, the Basic option worked just fine for those who don't mind HD streaming on a single device, only want to download content on one phone or tablet and don't need to add an extra person to their account. If they don't want to pay over $5 more for a Standard plan, they now have to make do with the Standard Ad-Supported tier that costs $7 a month in the US and \u00a35 in the UK. It supports Full HD streams and viewing on two devices at a time like the no-ads Standard plan, but it doesn't have offline viewing and the option to add a member. Subscribers can expect to see an average of <a href=\"https://help.netflix.com/en/node/126831\">4 minutes of ads an hour</a> at around 15 to 30 seconds each, which, of course, they cannot skip.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/netflix-axes-its-10-basic-plan-in-the-us-and-uk-123350885.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/netflix-axes-its-10-basic-plan-in-the-us-and-uk-123350885.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-19T12:33:50+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The Morning After: An unopened first-gen iPhone just sold for $190,000", "description": "<p>Don\u2019t go poking around your kitchen drawer gadget graveyard just yet.

The lot drew 28 bids, including five over $100,000. In recent months, LCG Auctions has sold two 8GB variants of the first-generation iPhone for $39,000 and $63,000.</p><p>This particular listing stood out by being a rare 4GB model. Apple only produced this model for two months. It's unlikely the buyer will actually open the package and use the phone, but if they did, they wouldn't even be able to make a phone call, since 2G networks are long gone in many parts of the world. Even selfies and FaceTime won't work, since there's no front-facing camera. And the main camera wouldn\u2019t offer much when it comes to photography, anyway, with its 2-megapixel sensor.

Its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-22-babylon-5-digital-video-quality.html\">initial production wasn't the highest quality</a> \u2014 to say the least \u2014 jumping between acted scenes and blurry CGI frames. But, in 2021, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment released <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/babylon-5-remastered-hbo-max-digital-download-080058907.html\"><em>Babylon 5 Remastered</em></a> to stream on what was then called HBO Max and as a digital download on iTunes and Amazon. The original camera negatives were scanned in 4K and then downscaled to HD with a clean-up and color correction to boot. The CGI sequences were upscaled to HD, and the show has been available to watch in its original 4:3 ever since.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The Blu-ray release will be &quot;fully remastered in HD,&quot; which could be the 2021 update or a newer version. <em>Babylon 5</em>'s Blu-ray edition is now available to pre-order for $100 and will be released in the US and Canada on December 5th.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/babylon-5-is-finally-coming-to-blu-ray-093539925.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/babylon-5-is-finally-coming-to-blu-ray-093539925.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-19T09:35:39+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "ASUS will manufacture and develop new Intel NUC mini PCs", "description": "<p>Intel has <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2d327af4-8b42-4ff1-a409-ae7bf906e9e9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Intel&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyZDMyN2FmNC04YjQyLTRmZjEtYTQwOS1hZTdiZjkwNmU5ZTkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW50ZWwuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvd3d3L3VzL2VuL25ld3Nyb29tL25ld3MvaW50ZWwtbnVjLXN5c3RlbXMtYWdyZWVtZW50Lmh0bWwjZ3MuM2FiNWZ4IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwYWFlNGRkNy01ZDhjLTRkNTktOGIwMi01MDgyZmZjYTgzODcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAaOhMUJJHYD1iPpunXaxjhLZMHTaFh1XT-CQtt0jE2by&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.intel.com%2Fcontent%2Fwww%2Fus%2Fen%2Fnewsroom%2Fnews%2Fintel-nuc-systems-agreement.html%23gs.3ab5fx\">announced</a> ASUS as the company's first partner for its Next Unit of Compute (NUC) <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/intel-nuc-12-extreme-review-gaming-mini-desktop-171532497.html\">mini PC</a> business. The two companies have entered a non-binding agreement that will see ASUS manufacture, sell and support the 10th- to 13th-generation products in Intel's NUC line. ASUS will also develop future NUC designs. Based on the business' current lineup, ASUS could be developing future NUC mini PCs, DIY kits for mini PCs, DIY kits for laptops, customizable boards, chassis and other assembly elements.&nbsp;</p><p>If you'll recall, Intel recently told <em>Engadget</em> that it's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/intel-will-stop-making-its-own-nuc-mini-pcs-154527920.html\">ending its \"direct investment\"</a> in its NUC business and will no longer produce first-party NUC products. It didn't elaborate on its reasoning, but working with partners for a non-essential business will free up resources it could use to concentrate on making chips. Intel previously said its <a href=\"https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1615/intel-reports-first-quarter-2023-financial-results\">first quarter earnings</a> exceeded expectations, but its revenue was still down 36 percent year-over-year when compared to its results in the same period for 2022. The company also said that it remains cautious in this economy.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>In its announcement of the partnership, Intel said ASUS' \"expertise and track record delivering industry-leading mini PCs to customers make it ideally suited to continue driving innovation and growth in NUC systems products.\" ASUS will be establishing a new business unit called \"ASUS NUC BU\" for all things related to Intel's NUC. The manufacturer will receive a non-exclusive license to Intel's NUC systems, though, making it possible for the chipmaker to team up with more companies in the future.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/asus-will-manufacture-and-develop-new-intel-nuc-mini-pcs-074606815.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/asus-will-manufacture-and-develop-new-intel-nuc-mini-pcs-074606815.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-19T07:46:06+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "TikTok expands its music streaming service test to Australia, Mexico and Singapore", "description": "<p>TikTok has started inviting users in Australia, Mexico and Singapore to participate in a closed beta test for its new music streaming service, according to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/18/tiktok-launches-music-streaming-service-australia-mexico-singapore/\"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> and <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=34e37b9c-8975-48da-aa39-df8bcd5badc3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CNBC&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNGUzN2I5Yy04OTc1LTQ4ZGEtYWEzOS1kZjhiY2Q1YmFkYzMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy8xOS90aWt0b2stbXVzaWMtbGF1bmNoZXMtYmV0YS10ZXN0aW5nLWluLWF1c3RyYWxpYS1tZXhpY28tYW5kLXNpbmdhcG9yZS5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjODQ3NzA0NS0yZWUwLTRiYjctYTlkMS04YjRlOTY3NTEwOGMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfLCPqw0RKGh1kpksl4Zlv0paOTbzitJacay1lIyKbYR&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2023%2F07%2F19%2Ftiktok-music-launches-beta-testing-in-australia-mexico-and-singapore.html\"><em>CNBC</em></a>. The short-form video hosting app initially launched beta testing for its fledgling streaming service in Brazil and Indonesia in early July. Now, it's expanding the scope of its music service's experimental phase and giving invited users in those regions a free three-month trial to be able to try it out.&nbsp;</p><p>TikTok Music is a completely separate app that testers will be able to download from the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store. It does, however, connect to the main TikTok app, so users can find the full versions of songs that go viral on the video-sharing platform. The music streaming app reportedly offers personalized song recommendations, real-time lyrics, collaborative playlists and the ability to find songs through a lyrics search feature, as well. <em>TechCrunch</em> says it has a Shazam-like feature, which presumably means it can find songs by listening to it, and will let users download tracks for offline listening.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The ByteDance-owned app told <em>TechCrunch</em> that once the testers' trial period is done, it will cost them AUD12 (US$8.16) per month in Australia, Mex$115 (US$6.86) in Mexico and S$9.90 (US$7.48) in Singapore to be able to keep using the service. TikTok already has a music streaming service called Resso available in India, Brazil and Indonesia, but it's shutting the app down in the last two countries in September. The company has yet to announce if and when its music app is also coming to the US, but it did <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tik-tok-might-be-working-on-a-music-app-or-service-115136729.html\">file a trademark application</a> for \"TikTok Music\" in the country back in May 2022.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-expands-its-music-streaming-service-test-to-australia-mexico-and-singapore-055121108.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-expands-its-music-streaming-service-test-to-australia-mexico-and-singapore-055121108.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-19T05:51:21+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}]
