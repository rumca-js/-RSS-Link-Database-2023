<p dir="ltr">In a recent Q2 2023 earnings interview for investors, Netflix announced the "success" of its paid account sharing initiative, now expanded to over 100 countries, accounting for more than 80 percent of its revenue. The crackdown, which started in the United States on May 23 and in several other countries in early February, aimed to address users sharing their Netflix passwords. Despite concerns, the company added 5.9 million subscribers in Q2, reaching a global total of 238.4 million, with only a limited number of cancellations resulting from the action.</p><p dir="ltr">"The cancel reaction was low and while we’re still in the early stages of monetization, we’re seeing healthy conversion of borrower households into full paying Netflix memberships as well as the uptake of our extra member feature," Netflix said in <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2023/q2/FINAL-Q2-23-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">its letter to investors</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">As the initiative expands, Netflix will tackle account sharing in nearly all remaining countries where the streaming service is offered, including Indonesia, Croatia, Kenya, and India.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-says-its-fight-against-password-sharing-is-working/1100-6516112/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Aquaman 2 Might Not Feature Batman (Or Batmen) After All

<p dir="ltr">It apparently hasn't been smooth sailing for Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. The DC sequel from filmmaker James Wan has reportedly completed its third round of reshoots, with stars Jason Mamoa and Patrick Wilson on site in New Zealand last month.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/aquaman-and-the-lost-kingdom-reshoots-1235532158/">The Hollywood Reporter</a> adds that reshoots are common for superhero blockbusters, but to have three of them is pretty rare. For context, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/aquaman-2-has-started-production-star-jason-momoa-teases-new-look/1100-6494101/">Aquaman 2 started production</a> all the way back on July 19, 2021--exactly two years ago today. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/aquaman-2-wraps-production-director-shares-photo-of-jason-momoa-and-patrick-wilson/1100-6499652/">The sequel then wrapped its initial shoot in January 2022</a>, and the film was set to release in December 2022. The movie is now set to release December 20, 2023, after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shazam-fury-of-the-gods-delayed-to-2023-pushes-back-aquaman-and-the-lost-kingdom/1100-6506876/">getting reshuffled along with the Shazam: Fury of the Gods delay</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The reshoots and changing release dates have reportedly led to Batman getting thrown overboard for Aquaman 2. Originally, Michael Keaton's Caped Crusader was supposed to show up in the sequel, as his character was going to appear in various DC films under former Warner Bros. bosses Toby Emmerich and his lieutenant, DC Films head Walter Hamada. But at one point, Aquaman 2 was going to premiere before The Flash, messing up those plans.

## Secret Invasion Episode 5 Easter Eggs - 6 Details You Missed In "Harvest"

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4167497-secretinvasion5eastereggs.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>This week on Secret Invasion, Nick Fury visits his own grave, Gravik deals with some dissent, we get one of the least interesting cameos imaginable, and it turns out the Skrulls have<em> yet another</em> secret plan that nobody had ever mentioned before on this show.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Warning: it's all spoilers from here.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Does Marvel have a policy against foreshadowing? That's the only reason I can think of for why Secret Invasion would just now introduce a new plot thread that had never even been hinted at in the previous four episodes.</p><p dir="ltr">Coming into this week's episode, Gravik's master plan to take over the Earth was basically complete. He gave his Skrulls superpowers, and he has the USA and Russia on the brink of a war that would turn the Earth into the sort of irradiated wasteland where Skrulls thrive and humans die. They just gotta give it that one last push.</p><p dir="ltr">Then, this week, characters start talking about "the Harvest." Apparently, Nick Fury collected all the DNA of everybody super who's been affiliated with the Avengers, and the Skrulls want it so they can become even more super. The only problem is the series only started teasing this "Harvest" in this episode, about 20 minutes before it revealed what it was. Considering this Harvest is suddenly the main plot thread of the series, that's pretty frustrating.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Gi'ah spends this episode with Nick Fury's Skrull wife, Varra. They hold a little funeral for Talos, who seems like he might actually be dead for real, and then they shoot some bad Skrulls who come looking for them. There are still other pieces in play, too: Skrull Rhodey is trying to get the president to bomb the Skrull base in Russia to instigate the war, and Sonya Falsworth has to deal with Skrull infiltrators of her own before linking up with Fury for the final big move.</p><p dir="ltr">And in the midst of all that, we got some Easter eggs.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. Tony Curran</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4167500-secretinvasioneastereggstonycurran.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>This Scottish actor is in the episode only briefly--he's Sonya's boss, who is secretly a Skrull, and Sonya shoots him. This is Curran's second such tiny-but-consequential role in the MCU after playing Bor, Odin's dad, in the opening sequence from Thor: The Dark World.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. The Harvest and the Battle of Earth</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4167545-secretinvasioneastereggsbattleofearth.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr"><span>When Fury is explaining this Harvest thing to Sonya, he says that in the aftermath of "the Battle of Earth" he sent Skrulls to the battlefield to collect blood and other DNA samples that had been left by super-powered individuals--aka the titular Harvest. I don't recall if it's ever been referred to this way in the MCU before, but in case you're wondering: The Battle of Earth is the big battle at the end of Avengers: Endgame.</span></p><p>That means, well, <em>everybody</em> is included in this sample. Nearly the entire main cast of every MCU subfranchise showed up for that one. It would probably be pretty bad if Gravik got that.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. Dr. Dalton</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4167502-secretinvasioneastereggsdrdalton.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Sonya goes after a pair of scientist Skrulls who were involved in the construction of the chamber that the bad Skrulls are using to give themselves powers, one of them being a woman who Sonya addresses as Dr. Dalton. This is likely a nod to an obscure comics character who appeared in a single X-Men issue, called Professor Dalton, who helped build a different sort of facility called The World, which could be used to create and evolve super-powered folks.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. Rick Mason</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4167503-secretinvasioneastereggsrickmason.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>When Nick Fury gets on the most-wanted list and needs a quick flight to Finland, he calls Rick Mason--the guy who provided those same services for Natasha Romanoff in the Black Widow film. I know I'm always complaining that the MCU needs to do more crossovers, but I didn't mean have an irrelevant character show up and do nothing.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. Widow's veil</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4167542-secretinvasionwhitenickfury.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>When Fury gets to Finland, he uses a digital mask to pretend to be a grey-haired white guy when he goes through Customs. This tech is original to the MCU and was first used in Captain America: The Winter Soldier by Natasha Romanoff to disguise herself as an old lady during the climax of the movie.</p><p>Calling it the "Widow's veil" is interesting, though, because they used this device on Agents of SHIELD <em>a lot</em>. So it had actually been thought of as a SHIELD thing rather than a Widow thing. But it seems like we can infer from the name that this was something Nat brought with her to SHIELD when she defected.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. Fury's many graves</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4167543-nickfurygravesecretinvasion.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Fury's ultimate destination in Finland is his own grave, which apparently has all his gear in it, including his eye patch--he jokes to Sonya that he has these gravesites all over the place. And we've seen at least one of his other grave sites--the one he visits with Natasha, Steve Rogers, and Sam Wilson at the end of Captain America: The Winter Soldier was definitely not in Finland, but this bit with the fake graves is clearly a nod to that film.</p></h3></p><br />

<p dir="ltr">The social deception genre made famous by games like Among Us is about to go undead, as Skybound and Other Ocean Interactive have announced The Walking Dead Betrayal, a new eight-player game based in The Walking Dead's zombie apocalypse.</p><p dir="ltr">The Walking Dead Betrayal sees eight players maintaining a settlement in rural Canada--gathering supplies, building houses and other structures, and more--as zombies infest the world around them.

## Review Roundup For Oppenheimer

<p>Reviews for Oppenheimer are in and the epic biopic looks to be another critical hit for celebrated director and screenwriter Christopher Nolan.</p><p>The biopic non-linearly splits its attention across the life of physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, who is played by Cillian Murphy. The film centers, of course, the development and testing of his horrific creation: the atomic bomb. Flashbacks and flash-forwards explore his education and a 1954 Atomic Energy Commission hearing on Oppenheimer's involvement with the US Communist party. The movie uses the first black-and-white footage ever to be shot on IMAX cameras.</p><p>Oppenheimer is directed and written by Christopher Nolan and is based on the book American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin. It stars Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr., Alden Ehrenreich, Florence Pugh, Matt Damon, Benny Safdie, and Kenneth Branagh.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/review-roundup-for-oppenheimer/1100-6516110/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## How The Last Of Us Part 2 Solved The Tricky Problem Of Third-Person Bows And Arrows

<p>Despite featuring many of the same weapon types, different games have varied ways of tackling how each of them works and feels. Sometimes this evolves through sequels, which is clearly evident when looking how how bows worked between <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-last-of-us/">The Last of Us</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii/">The Last of Us Part II</a>. The decisions that lead to this change were numerous, according to a senior game designer at Naughty Dog, who has broken down exactly how it works.</p><p>In an <a href="https://twitter.com/thedmatts/status/1681332397038764032?s=20">enlightening thread on Twitter</a>, designer Derek Mattson made the distinction between two popular methods of dealing with projectiles in games. One is used for slower moving ones, such a grenades, where a precise arc of movement can be displayed on screen to show players exactly how an object will move and where it will land, leaving just timing and placement up to the player. This is exactly how the bow in The Last of Us originally worked, with Mattson saying that the arrow could be seen as just a faster-moving grenade.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">1. Treat the bow more like a grenade<br />The original TLOU does this. The 2D reticle is replaced with an in world GUI arc. The player has near perfect info on the path of the projectile. The projectile is no longer shot from the camera and the problem is circumvented all together. <a href="https://t.co/kbZ4e3pMKf">pic.twitter.com/kbZ4e3pMKf</a></p>  — Derek Mattson (@thedmatts) <a href="https://twitter.com/thedmatts/status/1681332406597611521?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">July 18, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The downside to this approach, as Mattson continues, is a lower skill ceiling and a possible trade-off in satisfaction, since the ambiguity of where an arrow will land is completely removed. That's where a second approach offers a solution, with Mattson using <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tomb-raider/">Tomb Raider</a> as an example. He theorises that it uses a method that most firearms use in games, where the projectile doesn't originate from the weapon but rather from the point on the player camera where the reticle is pointing. This works well for fast projectiles, such as bullets, but can lead to a disconnect with a bow and arrow as the animation of the string on the bow can misalign with the speed and trajectory of the arrow, diminishing the feel of the entire action.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-the-last-of-us-part-2-solved-the-tricky-problem-of-third-person-bows-and-arrows/1100-6516109/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

While some fans assumed based on in-game tooltips for World Tier recommended levels that the requirements are level 50 for World Tier III and level 70 for World Tier IV, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2btUuC0UsE">YouTuber Zach Bitango</a> has revealed that's not the case. To unlock World Tier III, players will need to be at least level 40 in order to receive credit for completing its capstone dungeon. It's a similar story for World Tier IV. Now, players will need to be at least level 60 in order to progress to what is currently Diablo IV's hardest difficulty.</p><p dir="ltr">Prior to the Season 1 update, a high-level player could <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-power-leveling-guide-how-to-go-from-1-to-50-in-under-an-hour/1100-6515181/">"power-level"</a> a lower-level player by rushing them through the game's capstone dungeons in order to unlock the higher World Tiers and the increased experience, gold, and rewards they provide. A low-level player needed only to sit at the beginning of the capstone dungeon in order to soak up all the experience from the monsters killed by their high-level friend. With the higher World Tiers unlocked, low-level players could then have their high-level friend rush them through World Tier IV dungeons. Using this method, players could be boosted up to level 50 in an hour or less.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/undocumented-diablo-4-season-1-change-has-killed-its-best-power-leveling-strategy/1100-6516106/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Can Wireless Earbuds Surpass Gaming Headsets? Razer Hammerhead Review

<p dir="ltr">I've always thought of wireless earbuds as the audio option you use for convenience's sake. When I'm out and about listening to music or podcasts, a decent set of earbuds will do the trick and be a lot less cumbersome than moving in public in a pair of headphones. And sometimes wired earbuds plugged into my PlayStation or Xbox controller are just good enough. There are certainly high-end earbuds out there, but wireless options are often beholden to Bluetooth connectivity and in the context of gaming, the latency is certainly a deal-breaker. But one of the few pairs of earbuds that bridges the gap--the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Hammerhead-HyperSpeed-Wireless-Playstation/dp/B0C3G2PMC8?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20">Razer Hammerheads (the Pro Hyperspeed model, specifically)</a>--offers both great audio quality and low-latency connectivity.</p><p dir="ltr">But if the question is can earbuds--the <a href="https://www.razer.com/mobile-earphones/razer-hammerhead-pro-hyperspeed/RZ12-04590100-R3U1">Razer Hammerheads</a> in this case--replace a gaming headset, the short answer would be: yes, but with some notable caveats. While they shine with bold sound and solid bass, the battery life is the main drawback, especially when it comes to long gaming sessions. The Hammerheads have useful features to boot, like active noise canceling (ANC), ambient listening mode, and a low-latency wireless mode in addition to the 2.4GHz dongle that offers even lower latency. This gives them a level of versatility rarely seen in other gaming-centric audio devices, just expect to be popping these into the charging case often. And expect to drop a whopping $200 USD for them.</p><figure style="width: 4032px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1574/15747411/4167480-img_3174.jpg"><img alt="Razer Hammerhead Pro Hyperspeed wireless earbuds." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/4167480-img_3174.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Razer Hammerhead Pro Hyperspeed wireless earbuds.</figcaption></figure><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Hammerhead-HyperSpeed-Wireless-Playstation/dp/B0C3G2PMC8?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20">See at Amazon</a> </div><h2 dir="ltr">Sound Quality</h2><p dir="ltr">I've used the Razer Hammerhead earbuds for about a week, replacing my standard Apple AirPods for listening to music and podcasts from my phone and the various headsets I have for my multiple gaming setups.

<p>A video game based on The Mandalorian isn't currently in development, but one fan of the hit Star Wars show has created a tantalizing mock-up of what a potential game starring the iconic bounty hunter could look like.

## Marvel's Spider-Man 2 Developers Reveal How They Put A New Spin On Venom

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-2-villains-release-date-and-everything-we-know/1100-6514068/">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> introduces several new antagonists to menace New York's resident web-slingers, but it's the arrival of Venom that may prove to be too much to handle for the duo. In a new interview, creative director Bryan Intihar spoke about how developer Insomniac cast Tony Todd (Candyman) as one of Spider-Man's most iconic villains and he hinted at the studio having an original take on the classic character.</p><p>When it came to casting the voice of Venom, Intihar says that he initially avoided doing that for as long as possible because of the pressure attached to finding the right actor to bring the symbiote to life. After Intihar heard a few lines of Tony Todd reprising his role as the Candyman in the 2021 film of the same name, Intihar was pleasantly surprised to discover that Todd had already submitted an audition tape for Marvel's Spider-Man 2. "Everything we talked about [with] Venom--that sense of strength, that sense of fear, that sense of overwhelming, so different from Peter--Tony embraces that completely in the performance," Intihar said to <a href="https://ew.com/events/comic-con/marvels-spider-man-2-venom-tony-todd/">EW</a>.</p><p>As for how Insomniac's version of Venom differs from other incarnations, Intihar said that this Venom embodies power and strength as an "anti-Spider-Man" for the heroes to face. "We wanted to try something very different, and I don't think you can get much more different from Doc Ock than you do Venom," Intihar explained. "It's about power, it's about strength, it's about being slighted, it's about Peter being involved much more in the creation of Venom. I think that's what attracted us."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-2-developers-reveal-how-they-put-a-new-spin-on-venom/1100-6516101/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Oppenheimer Review - Christopher Nolan's Big One

<p dir="ltr">Oppenheimer is not an easy film to write about after one viewing. It's a massive movie both in terms of its length and in terms of its intricately and painstakingly laid-out story, which defies all of Hollywood's rules for biographical and historical films. Christopher Nolan, as always, is doing things his way. And it's going to take the rest of us a minute to catch up.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite what you may have heard from some vociferous Batman fans, Christopher Nolan doesn't make perfect movies. Not because he screws them up, but because he only takes aim at targets that are immensely difficult to hit. The climactic "temporal pincer movement" of Tenet, for example, is incomprehensible and doesn't work--but it was also a paradoxical concept to begin with that might simply have been impossible to portray in live action. He took a big swing and he missed pretty hard, but how many other filmmakers would have even been able to try something like that? Not many.</p><p dir="ltr">By contrast to Tenet, a high-concept sci-fi action flick, Oppenheimer does seem a bit mundane. It's just a movie about the guy who ran the Manhattan Project that created the first atomic bomb during World War II. It's the most grounded subject matter he's ever had for a movie, but that didn't stop him from bringing the exact same intensity and epic feel that his action movies have.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/oppenheimer-review-christopher-nolans-big-one/1900-6418091/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Leave it to Nintendo to deliver another critically acclaimed entry in a long-running franchise.

Steve Watts wrote: "Pikmin 4 is a game, sure, but it's also a sort of low-impact activity that gives you the same satisfaction of checking off a list of small, relatively simple tasks. That makes it pleasant to play, but that quality also makes it feel discordant when it briefly adds elements that provide a mild but noticeable degree of pressure--elements that make it more traditionally 'game-like.'" Watts added that he completed the campaign in about 30 hours, though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-long-to-beat-pikmin-4/1100-6516068/">how long it'll take to beat Pikmin 4</a> will vary by your playstyle.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/review-roundup-for-pikmin-4/1100-6516098/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Canadian filmmaker James Cameron has expressed agreement with AI experts' warnings about the potential dangers posed by advancements in artificial intelligence. Speaking to <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/i-warned-you-guys-in-1984-terminator-filmmaker-james-cameron-says-of-ai-s-risks-to-humanity-1.6484546">CTV</a>, Cameron acknowledged the concerns raised by the "godfathers of AI" regarding the need for regulation before AI becomes a significant threat to humanity.</p><p dir="ltr">"I warned you guys in 1984 [with Terminator], and you didn't listen," Cameron said. "I think the weaponization of AI is the biggest danger… I think that we will get into the equivalent of a nuclear arms race with AI, and if we don't build it, the other guys are for sure going to build it, and so then it'll escalate."</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollywood-actors-begin-strike-today-oppenheimer-stars-leave-premiere-first-strike-since-1980/1100-6515940/">ongoing writers' and actors' strikes</a> in the United States have also highlighted the need for regulating AI. In his Canadian TV interview, Cameron said his philosophy there boils down to "it's never an issue of who wrote it, it's a question of, is it a good story?"

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/madden-nfl-24/">Madden 24</a> has continued ratings week and today it's the running back position in the spotlight. This is one of the most skilled positions on an offense in Madden and the key to having a balanced offensive attack. In the past, the overall ratings for the running backs in Madden have been highly controversial, but this year has delivered a fairly solid top 10 list.</p><p>There are incumbents such as Derrick Henry, Christian McCaffrey, and Dalvin Cook in addition to some newcomers. Running backs had a stellar year as a whole during the 2022-23 NFL season, and many of them were rewarded with higher ratings in Madden 24. However, there were some RBs that fell down the ratings charts and find themselves outside of the top 10 to start the season. They can, of course, break back into the top 10 with a rating adjustment, so don't get too attached to your favorite back's rating just yet. For now, though, we can look at the initial top 10 running backs in Madden 24 by OVR.</p><h2>Top 10 RBs in Madden 24</h2><p>There are only three differences between this year's top 10 list and last year's, which is par for the course when we look at other positional groups in Madden 24, such as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-madden-24-wrs-top-wide-receivers-by-ovr-rating/1100-6516036/">wide receivers</a>. However, the positions of certain running backs in the top 10 have drastically changed, as there's a new back at the top of the list. You can see the full ratings for running backs on <a href="https://t.co/jNG0WRU0Y3">EA's website</a> once you check out the top 10 below.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-madden-24-rbs-top-running-backs-by-ovr-rating/1100-6516099/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

With a sequel featuring both Spider-Men on the way, the studio's <em>next </em>project is one that has Marvel fans excited as a legendary mutant is stepping back into the spotlight.</p><p>The last time that Wolverine had a solo game was all the way back in 2009 with X-Men Origins: Wolverine. A tie-in game to the film of the same name, Raven Software's single-player adventure was a gruesome and action-packed spectacle of blood, guts, and adamantium claws. More than a decade later, Insomniac's take on the X-Man is looking like a spiritual successor, and while the game is still deep in development, a few details about Marvel's Wolverine have surfaced since it was first revealed.</p><h2>Release date</h2><div>          </div><p>The biggest mystery--aside from Wolverine's ability to somehow heal both flesh <em>and </em>clothing in his 2009 game--is when this game will be out. Insomniac's busy right now with work on Marvel's Spider-Man 2, which has a release date of October 20 on PS5. After the game was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/marvels-wolverine-playstation-showcase-2021/2300-6456183/">first revealed in 2021</a>, Ryan Schneider, head of franchise strategy at Insomniac, said that the game was "very early in development," suggesting a long wait lie ahead for fans of the surly mutant.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-wolverine-gameplay-platforms-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516081/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The Call of Duty series is soaring right now, as Activision has announced that the series has climbed to around 90 million monthly players, while Modern Warfare 2/Warzone's microtransactions are putting up big numbers. Not only that, but Activision revealed how much money Call of Duty: Mobile has earned so far, and it's a <em>lot</em>. This information came out of Activision Blizzard's latest earnings briefing.</p><p>Call of Duty: Mobile saw engagement and net bookings remain "stable" year-over-year, Activision said. Lifetime spending on the game since it launched in October 2019 recently surpassed $3 billion. That is a massive number, but it's only about <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/pokemon-go-6-billion-revenue">half of what Pokemon Go has earned during its lifetime</a>. For what it's worth, Pokemon Go was on the market for several years before Call of Duty Mobile launched in 2019.</p><p>According to <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/call-of-duty-mobile-shoots-past-usd1-5-billion-in-lifetime-player-spending/">Sensor Tower</a>, Call of Duty Mobile earned $1.5 billion by February 2022, a figure it has now officially doubled in the time since.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-makes-a-huge-amount-of-money-on-mobile-heres-how-much/1100-6516083/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

The latest update, patch 4.04, adds fresh content inspired by the Netflix series, improves cross-progression across various platforms, and adds several fixes to the Nintendo Switch edition, along with plenty of other enhancements in general.</p><p>On Xbox Series X|S, update 4.04 has fixed an issue in which the cross-progression setting did not update the interface of the cloud saves correctly. Likewise, there were issues when certain players would attempt to load saves using the cross-progression feature across multiple machines with the same GOG account. This has been fixed.</p><p>On Nintendo Switch, a new feature has been added to streamline the cross-progression process. Logging into your account will give access to the latest saves via the cloud, allowing you to pick up where you left off on other platforms. The Nintendo Switch version has been updated to include all the content from the 4.0 patch.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-3-patch-adds-more-netflix-series-cosmetics-and-improves-cross-progression/1100-6516084/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">If you want a new arcade cabinet for your game room but you need it to have a little extra pizzazz, then Arcade1Up and Kith may just have what you're looking for. GameSpot can exclusively reveal the Marvel | Kith for Arcade1up Marvel vs. Capcom 2 cabinet, and while the name might be a mouthful, you should be very familiar with its roster of classic fighting games.</p><p dir="ltr">The cabinet, available the <a href="https://arcade1up.com/products/arcade1up-x-kith-marvel-vs-capcom-2%E2%84%A2">Arcade1Up site</a> beginning July 24 at 8 AM PT / 11 AM ET, sports co-branding from Arcade1up and Kith, with a Kith marquee and some classic X-Men designs on the riser.

Here's how long it will take to beat Pikmin 4.</p><p><strong>Pikmin 4 spoilers follow.</strong></p><h2><strong>How long is Pikmin 4?</strong></h2><p>The latest game in the Pikmin series features some massive areas to explore, and a wider variety of activities.

## Pikmin 4 Review - Veggie Might

<p dir="ltr">One of the most prominent apps on my phone is a simple to-do list app. I have a handful of recurring tasks every month or year, along with whatever I jot down as a reminder. It took me more than 20 hours with Pikmin 4 before I identified that the sensation it evoked was the same as that of completing my to-do list. Pikmin 4 is a game, sure, but it's also a sort of low-impact activity that gives you the same satisfaction of checking off a list of small, relatively simple tasks. That makes it pleasant to play, but that quality also makes it feel discordant when it briefly adds elements that provide a mild but noticeable degree of pressure--elements that make it more traditionally "game-like." On the whole, I think I prefer Pikmin the activity to Pikmin the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Pikmin 4 is meant to be a welcoming entry point for first-timers. The effort to bring you into the world of Pikmin begins very literally, with a character creator that allows you to make your own Rescue Crew member. The tools weren't robust enough to make a facsimile of me--very few beard options, for one thing--but I made a cute little man who I was proud of and wanted to see go on an adventure regardless. With my stubby adventurer fully formed, I was ready to explore the world of Pikmin.</p><p dir="ltr">For the uninitiated, that world is basically a suburban Earth-like backyard. While the diminutive characters never acknowledge it, it's very clear from your surroundings that you've crash landed in a garden. Your surroundings might be checkered with gardening tools or mounds of dirt left by whoever occupied the home. There's a playful sense of scale to the setting that recontextualizes common household objects as massive obstacles or helpful bridges. Sometimes, you fall into a steady rhythm of puzzle-solving and completely forget the nature of your surroundings, until you suddenly pull back and realize there was a giant metal pail or bag of sod just next to where you've been excavating.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pikmin-4-review-veggie-might/1900-6418090/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
