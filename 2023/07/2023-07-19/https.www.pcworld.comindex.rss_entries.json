[{"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Google releases its Android AirDrop clone for Windows, Nearby Share", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>You now have a new way to connect your Windows PC to an Android device to share files: Nearby Share, an app Google released Wednesday and which will be bundled with upcoming PCs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the name suggests, Nearby Share allows you to share files back and forth between Android devices and PCs. It&rsquo;s similar to Apple&rsquo;s AirDrop, with the key difference being that Nearby Share connects devices from two different companies, rather than iPhones and Macs. Google released the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1680736/androids-airdrop-alternative-nearby-share-now-works-on-windows.html\">beta version of Nearby Share</a> earlier this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nearby Share connects your phone to your PC, but it can also be used for you to send files and photos to nearby Android phones that you don&rsquo;t use, as well as to nearby PCs. That makes it handy for simply sharing a photo at a concert, or dropping a file onto a friend&rsquo;s PC without hassle. You&rsquo;ll just need to be within about 16 feet to do so, Google says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why use Nearby Share? Google&rsquo;s unspoken argument is that it&rsquo;s simpler to do so. There are already numerous ways to view and transfer files and photos from Android phones to PCs, from the tried-and-true sneakerware to uploading and downloading from the cloud, to more modern approaches like Microsoft&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/398215/how-to-use-windows-your-phone-app-to-connect-your-phone-to-your-pc.html\">Your Phone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/628261/microsoft-is-updating-your-phone-and-calling-it-phone-link.html\">now called Phone Link</a>. Device makers like Samsung also have released <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1536118/samsungs-pc.html\">their own specific versions</a> for Galaxy devices. Google, though, made its mark with Gmail and search, both functions that worked more simply and effectively than other solutions. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Google Nearby Share for Windows\" class=\"wp-image-2000607\" height=\"249\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Nearby_Share_AdobeExpress.gif\" width=\"249\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Google</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-to-use-nearby-share\">How to use Nearby Share</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nearby Share is already built into Android devices, specifically phones and tablets running Android 6 and up. Windows users will have to download the app itself. (You can <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://android.com/better-together/nearby-share-app/#&amp;xcust=2-3-2000589-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">directly download the Nearby Share file</a> from this link.) You&rsquo;ll need Windows 10 or 11, and Arm devices aren&rsquo;t currently supported.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After downloading and installing the app, Googe recommends that you sign in to your Google account and check your Device Visibility preferences. You&rsquo;ll be able to limit Nearby Sharing to friends, contacts, anyone, or just turn it off entirely. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On your Android phone, you&rsquo;ll need to enable Nearby Share. Make sure Bluetooth, location, and Nearby Share are turned on in your device&rsquo;s settings app. You&rsquo;ll need to launch the Windows app, then make sure that Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are connected as well. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Google Nearby Share for Windows\" class=\"wp-image-2000608\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Nearby_Share_2_AdobeExpress.gif\" width=\"360\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Google</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>To initiate file sharing, you&rsquo;ll simply opt to right-click and share the file. Under <em>Looking for nearby devices</em>, simply select the device to share with. You&rsquo;ll receive a notification if someone wishes to share a file with you, which you&rsquo;ll have to accept. You also may be asked to turn on file sharing. If you wish to accept the file, you can click <em>Accept</em>; otherwise, you can turn down the request. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re having trouble, Google advises that each device turn on airplane mode, then turn it off again. Make sure the devices are physically close, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\nWindows</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2000589/google-releases-its-android-airdrop-windows-nearby-share.html", "date_published": "2023-07-19T17:49:08+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Best laptops for video editing 2023: Best overall, best screen, and more", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Video editing can put a heavy burden on any computer.

This ultra-thin laptop measures just 0.66-inch thick and tips the scales at a mere 3.9 pounds, making it significantly smaller than most laptops with video editing chops. But Razer didn&rsquo;t skimp on the firepower, loading the Blade 14 with AMD&rsquo;s 8-core Ryzen 9 5900HX flagship CPU, Nvidia&rsquo;s 8GB GeForce RTX 3080, a 1TB NVMe SSD, and 16GB of memory. </p>\n\n<p>You&rsquo;ll give up some perks in exchange for the Blade&rsquo;s portability though: The 14-inch IPS-grade screen comes factory calibrated, but tops out at 2560&times;1440 resolution. 4K video editing is off the table, though the laptop supports the full DCI-P3 color gamut. Razer&rsquo;s notebook also lacks an SD card slot. But if you need a fierce rig that can chew through edits and renders then slip easily into your bag, the Blade 14 is worth considering.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/395027/razer-blade-14-2021-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRazer Blade 14 (2021) review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ad page-ad has-ad-prefix ad-article\"></div>\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-separator\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart-item product-chart-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper--title product-chart-title \" id=\"dell-inspiron-16-best-for-battery-life\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDell Inspiron 16 &ndash; Best for battery life\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"large-pro-cons-product-chart-section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproduct-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper--large\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Dell Inspiron 16 - Best for battery life\" class=\"product-chart-item__image\" height=\"3024\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Dell-Inspiron-16-2-in-1-overview.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"4032\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-columns\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tRoomy 16-inch 16:10 display\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tLong battery life\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tCompetitive application performance\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tComfortable keyboard and huge touchpad\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tQuad speakers pump up the jams\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tLone GPU upgrade is lackluster\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tCan&rsquo;t go bigger than 512GB SSD\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tLarge screen can feel awkward in tablet mode\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__information \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-label\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>If it&rsquo;s battery life that you&rsquo;re concerned about, the Dell Inspiron 16 should cover you just fine. When we ran our battery benchmark, which cycles through a series of tasks and videos until the laptop dies, the Inspiron 16 lasted a marathon 16.5 hours on a single charge. That should allow you to edit to your heart&rsquo;s content while out on the road. Due to the battery, it isn&rsquo;t the most portable, however, weighing in at a substantial 4.7 pounds. </p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s rather inexpensive, but for the price you will have to make sacrifices. It sports a Intel Core i7-1260P CPU, Intel Iris Xe graphics, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of SSD storage. While that should get the job done with most video-editing projects, it does lack storage capacity, so you will need an <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/406861/best-external-drives.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">external drive</a> if you&rsquo;re saving video files. What really makes this laptop shine though, is the outstanding battery life which is an often overlooked aspect of mobile video editors. And as a bonus perk, it also comes with a surprisingly robust quad speaker system. For ports, you&rsquo;re getting two USB Type-C, one USB-A 3.2 Gen 1, one HDMI, one SD card reader, and one 3.5mm audio jack. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1068741/dell-inspiron-16-2-in-1-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDell Inspiron 16 2-in-1 review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ad page-ad has-ad-prefix ad-article\"></div>\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart product-chart\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-separator\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart-item product-chart-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper--title product-chart-title \" id=\"msi-titan-gt77-hx-13v-best-high-end-laptop-for-video-editing\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMSI Titan GT77 HX 13V &ndash; Best high-end laptop for video editing\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"large-pro-cons-product-chart-section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproduct-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper--large\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"MSI Titan GT77 HX 13V - Best high-end laptop for video editing\" class=\"product-chart-item__image\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/msi-titan-gt77-4-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1500\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-columns\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tExcellent mechanical keyboard\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tClass-leading Mini-LED display\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tIncredible CPU and GPU performance\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t2TB of solid state storage with PCIe Gen5 support\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tUninspired design&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tShort battery life\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__information \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-label\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4999 Euro\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>When it comes to video editing, the MSI Titan GT77 HX 13V ticks off all the right boxes. This rig sports powerful components and a stunning 4K display, which is the perfect combination for a creator&rsquo;s laptop. It&rsquo;s rocking an Intel Core i9-13980HX CPU, an Nvidia RTX 4090 GPU, 64GB of RAM, and 2TB of PCIe SSD storage. That&rsquo;s a massive amount of storage right there, which is perfect for offloading large files. The 17.3-inch IPS display has a resolution of 3840&times;2160, a refresh rate of 144Hz, and a peak brightness level of 585 nits. According to our reviewer, it&rsquo;s the highest brightness on record for any laptop in SDR. IPS displays tend to have superb color accuracy as well as wide viewing angles, by the way. However, it does have one major shortcoming and that&rsquo;s the astronomical price. If your budget knows no limits and you&rsquo;re looking for an absolute beast of a laptop, then the MSI Titan is worth considering.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1561127/msi-titan-gt77-hx-13v-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMSI Titan GT77 HX 13V review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ad page-ad has-ad-prefix ad-article\"></div>\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart product-chart\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-separator\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart-item product-chart-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper--title product-chart-title \" id=\"apple-macbook-pro-2023-best-macbook-for-video-editing\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApple MacBook Pro (2023) &ndash; Best MacBook for video editing\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"large-pro-cons-product-chart-section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproduct-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper--large\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Apple MacBook Pro (2023) - Best MacBook for video editing\" class=\"product-chart-item__image\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/16-inch-macbook-pro-2023-fcp1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-columns\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tGood performance boost over its predecessor\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tHDMI upgrade expands external display options\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tEquipped with Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t1080p camera without Center Stage\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tSome will deem the notch unsightly\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tTouch Bar fans will be disappointed\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tNo ethernet port\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__information \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-label\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"not-amp\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/441466/7618?prodsku=MNWD3D%2FA&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fde%2Fshop%2Fgo%2Fproduct%2FMNWD3&amp;intsrc=CATF_2785&amp;xcust=2-3-560670-6-1477999-9934&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">&euro;3229.00 at  Apple</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>If you&rsquo;re in a long and committed relationship with Apple&rsquo;s ecosystem, you should check out the latest MacBook Pro (2023) laptop. Not only are you getting a 19-core GPU, but also 2TB of SSD storage. That&rsquo;s a ton of space and graphics firepower right there, which is vital for video editing tasks. The laptop&rsquo;s 12-core M2 Pro CPU chip is a solid boost over last year&rsquo;s model, too. In fact, according to the Geekbench 5 benchmark, Apple&rsquo;s 20 percent improvement claim falls right in line with our results. The 16.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR display is also drop-dead gorgeous, with a maximum brightness level of over 1,000 nits and a crystal-clear resolution of 3456&times;2234.

The faster your hardware, the faster your edits, essentially. In addition to subjecting all of the laptops above to our usual battery of benchmarks, we also ran the UL Procyon Video Editing Test on several high-powered laptops to see which hardware performs best for this sort of work. The benchmark tasks Adobe Premiere with importing two different video projects, applying visual effects such as color grading and transitions, and then exporting it using H.264, H.265 at both 1080p and 4K.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"UL Procyon Video Editing benchmarks\" class=\"wp-image-560671\" height=\"641\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ul-procyon-video-editing-scores.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><p>Right-click and select &ldquo;open in new tab&rdquo; to see in full resolution.</p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Gordon Mah Ung / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The best performance came from big, heavy laptops running Intel&rsquo;s 11th-generation processors, though notebooks with AMD&rsquo;s beefy Ryzen 9 processors came in just behind, with 10th-gen Intel chips still putting up a respectable score. They&rsquo;re not in the chart above, but <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/607526/core-i9-12900hk-review-intel-alder-lake-laptops-crush-the-competition.html\">newer Intel 12th-gen laptops</a> run even faster still. The best-performing laptops all paired modern Intel CPUs with Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX 30-series GPUs, which isn&rsquo;t surprising as both companies have invested a lot of time and resources into optimizing their Adobe performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The GPU matters more than CPU in Premiere Pro, though things reach a point of diminishing returns very quickly. Notebooks wielding top-tier RTX 3080 graphics are indeed faster at video editing than laptops with more modest RTX 3060 graphics, but not by that much. If you look at the scores from the Dell XPS 17 9710, its GeForce RTX 3060 Laptop GPU is maybe 14 percent slower than the fastest RTX 3080 in the MSI GE76 Raider. That&rsquo;s not a lot, especially when you consider how big and thick the GE76 Raider is compared to the Dell laptop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, having any sort of discrete graphics is preferred, with at least an RTX 3060 recommended for serious video editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Video editing is very workflow dependent however. Your particular task and tool might be more CPU intensive, or lean more on the GPU than Premiere. If so, adjust your priorities accordingly. The selections above should all be great well-rounded options, however. Intel and Nvidia have spent years building up tools like Quick Sync and CUDA, respectively, and many video editing apps can see significant speed boosts because of it. AMD hardware does fine for video editing, but we recommend sticking to Intel and Nvidia unless you have a strong reason otherwise, especially if your workflow relies on their vendor-specific software optimizations.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Dell XPS 17 ports\" class=\"wp-image-560697\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/dell-xps-17-sd-card.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><p>If you&rsquo;re transferring video from a camera, an SD card port (like this one on the Dell XPS 17) is essential, unless you&rsquo;re comfortable plugging an SD card adapter into a high-speed USB or Thunderbolt port.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Gordon Mah Ung/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s not all about the internals though. PCWorld video director Adam Patrick Murray stresses that an ideal laptop for video editing includes an SD card reader for grabbing video off a camera. He also recommends opting for a notebook with a 4K, 60Hz panel over the ultra-fast 1080p panels often found on gaming laptops that would otherwise be ideal for video editing. You need a 4K panel to edit 4K videos well, and blazing-fast refresh rates don&rsquo;t mean anything for video editing like they do for gaming. If color accuracy matters to you&mdash;it might not if you&rsquo;re only creating casual videos for your personal YouTube channel, for example&mdash;then support for the full DCI-P3 color gamut is also a must, along with <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://color.viewsonic.com/explore/content/DeltaE%E2%89%A62Color-Accuracy_2.html&amp;xcust=2-3-560670-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Delta E &lt; 2 color accuracy</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You won&rsquo;t often find those sorts of specs listed for (or supported by) gaming laptops, but dedicated content creation laptops should include that information. That said, if you want the fastest possible laptop for video editing that can also satisfy your gaming proclivities, you can always pair that burly gaming laptop with a color-accurate external monitor for creation tasks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a more general purpose notebook, be sure to check out our guide to <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/436674/the-best-pc-laptops-of-the-year.html\">the best laptops</a> for picks for every budget.

Next, you have to write down three sentences in English. And finally, you have to adjust the spacing between the individual characters, the spacing between the individual words, and the size of the characters using the slider.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each step and, of course, the finished font can be saved so that you can also adjust the font later.

The Vulcan II, particularly in the white-on-aluminum colorway seen here, is so gosh-darned pretty that it could make a Macbook Air jealous.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately the keyboard&rsquo;s charms don&rsquo;t end with its looks. Some decent switches and extras, plus a price that&rsquo;s at least competitive, means that its appeal is more than skin-deep. The Vulcan II isn&rsquo;t the best gaming keyboard on the market&hellip;but if you&rsquo;re looking for a way to bling up your battlestation, you might not care.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Further reading:</strong> See our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/406235/best-gaming-keyboard.html\">best gaming keyboards</a> to learn about competing products.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"roccat-vulcan-ii-rgb-splendor\">Roccat Vulcan II: RGB splendor</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Vulcan II is so big, so bright, and so beautiful it&rsquo;s actually distracting. Like the smaller version, it utilizes &ldquo;floating&rdquo; keycaps with minimal sidewalls that let the ultra-bright RGB LEDs shine through. Combine that with the white tops, transparent switch housings, the super-reflective brushed-aluminum deck, and the best animation for lighting on the market, and this keyboard is the one to buy if you&rsquo;re nostalgic for laser light shows at your local planetarium.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>The Vulcan II isn&rsquo;t the best gaming keyboard on the market&hellip;but if you&rsquo;re looking for a way to bling up your battlestation, you might not care.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>(If you don&rsquo;t know what a laser light show is, ask your parents, and then get off my lawn.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything about the board is set up to show off the lighting, and it doesn&rsquo;t disappoint. I&rsquo;m not just talking about pure lumens, either. Roccat&rsquo;s boards also have the smoothest and most aesthetically appealing light animations I&rsquo;ve ever seen.&nbsp;By default the Vulcan II will gently transition between shades (lava lamp-style), but also react to individual keypresses. Normally I disable this kind of thing, but the animations on this board are so fluid and so variable that I left them be. They&rsquo;re that pretty. Even the status indicators, illuminated just below the arrow cluster, look gorgeous.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\" Roccat Vulcan II keyboard status lights\" class=\"wp-image-1998963\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DSC04999.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-are-the-roccat-vulcan-iis-specs\">What are the Roccat Vulcan II&rsquo;s specs?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So what else does the keyboard have going for it? Well, it&rsquo;s a full-sized, 108-key layout, so fans of the num pad will be happy. It includes a radial dial and dedicated media keys just above that, in the most natural spot. Said dial is very &ldquo;clicky,&rdquo; like an old-fashioned RCA TV channel selector (man, I&rsquo;m really showing my age with this review), but can also be pressed in to activate mute by default.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-half-width is-float-right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"the-smaller-sibling\">\n\t\t\t\t\tThe smaller sibling\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"roccat-vulcan-ii-mini\">Roccat Vulcan II Mini</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Roccat Vulcan II Mini\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/650781_435529_01_front_zoom.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1000\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review product-widget__review-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__rating-and-review-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__review-details--rating\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1338064/roccat-vulcan-ii-mini-keyboard-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__pricing-details  \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.microcenter.com/product/650781/ROCCAT_Vulcan_II_Mini_-_White&amp;xcust=2-3-1997409-5-1338072-14628&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$150 at  MicroCenter</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"amp-bar\"> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.roccat.com/products/vulcan-ii-mini?variant=41979871690910&amp;xcust=2-3-1997409-5-1338072-14628&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$150 at  Roccat Store</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>The keyboard includes a wrist rest in the box, an all-too-rare feature for premium full-sized boards. It clicks into the main board&rsquo;s body but has an unfortunate tendency to sag in the middle under intense typing. The appealingly textured bottom (you, in the back, stop that giggling) has plastic feet with just one stage, but are fairly high-profile for that. And the braided USB cord is, regrettably, fixed&mdash;an odd choice when the less-expensive Vulcan II Mini&rsquo;s is detachable. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\" Roccat Vulcan II keyboard volume wheel\" class=\"wp-image-1998965\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DSC05056.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of pure gaming chops, the Vulcan II offers full N-key rollover, 1,000Hz polling (not great in terms of competition, but admit it, you don&rsquo;t have literal millisecond reflexes anyway), and onboard storage for up to four profiles. Unfortunately you can&rsquo;t program it without Roccat&rsquo;s Swarm software, which is exclusive to Windows.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"whats-it-like-to-type-and-game-on-the-roccat-vulcan-ii\">What&rsquo;s it like to type and game on the Roccat Vulcan II?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Roccat&rsquo;s floating keycaps take some getting used to. They&rsquo;re ABS instead of the more premium PBT, which is <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1666820/havit-kb487l-keyboard-review.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">starting to become standard</a> even on midrange boards. But I&rsquo;ll give the designers the benefit of the doubt and assume the material choice is yet another decision to make the Vulcan II as shiny as possible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, the keycaps have a flat profile that, combined with the slick finish, made my fingers slip around a bit for the first few days. I was able to adjust, but this keyboard definitely takes a little getting used to, and I can&rsquo;t help but feel like the keycaps are undermining the gaming focus a bit. Of course, nothing stops you from replacing the keycaps with a set of regular ones&hellip;aside from the tears of the engineers who spent so much time making this keyboard a disco ball you can type on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\" Roccat Vulcan II keyboard switches\" class=\"wp-image-1998964\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DSC05087.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Strangely, the Vulcan II does <em>not </em>get the custom optical switches featured on the Vulcan II Mini, the new II Mini Air, and the somehow even shinier <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.roccat.com/products/vulcan-ii-max&amp;xcust=2-3-1997409-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Vulcan II Max</a>.

It&rsquo;s an odd omission that makes this keyboard the least advanced in Roccat&rsquo;s entire line&hellip;but it&rsquo;s also far less expensive than the similarly sized Max, so I&rsquo;m inclined to be forgiving.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The linear switches on my review unit are serviceable, if nothing special. With the contacts at the actuation point they&rsquo;re noticeably &ldquo;bumpier&rdquo; than the optical switches of the Vulcan II Mini, but still fairly premium with a less chattery sound and press. The hall effect (the walls on the side of the stem) also lend a little more stability that the floating keycaps take away from the other Vulcan boards. Roccat says these &ldquo;Titan II Red&rdquo; switches come pre-lubed, and indeed they&rsquo;re pretty smooth, but not as nice as the super-fancy Kailh switches in the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1793350/keydous-nj80-ap-keyboard-review.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Keydous NJ80-AP</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\" Roccat Vulcan II keyboard from the side\" class=\"wp-image-1998968\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DSC05163.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite being standard mechanical, the keyboard&rsquo;s switches are not hot-swap, so you can&rsquo;t replace them. But again, if you&rsquo;re buying this board for the light show, that&rsquo;s probably not a deal-breaker. All things considered, I have to ding the keyboard for going with standard instead of optical switches, since it&rsquo;s branded as a gaming board. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"roccat-vulcan-ii-software\">Roccat Vulcan II software&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Roccat Swarm is fairly middle-of-the-road as far as gaming software goes. On the one hand, it&rsquo;s using the ultra-dark color scheme they all seem to favor that makes everything twice as hard to find as it needs to be. On the other hand, it&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1915729/asus-azoth-keyboard-review.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">not trying to get me to use coupons</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Roccat Swarm typing sound\" class=\"wp-image-1998979\" height=\"753\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/swarm-typing-sound.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Swarm does have the most annoying feature I&rsquo;ve ever seen in one of these: the ability to add software sounds to each key press. If you work in an office and genuinely loathe your coworkers, buy a Roccat keyboard and set it to play <em>Star Wars</em> pew-pew laser noise through your PC speakers every time you hit a key. If you can type a hundred words per minute, someone will attempt to murder you by lunch, guaranteed. But this &ldquo;feature&rdquo; is disabled by default, so any harm it does is entirely on you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The software does fine at managing custom bindings and macros, though once again, you can&rsquo;t re-bind the f&rsquo;n Fn button (or the left Windows key, weirdly). By default, Caps Lock activates &ldquo;Easy Shift,&rdquo; which is essentially a second function layer. Roccat makes a big deal out of this, but since VIA and QMK have been doing it for years, you can color me unimpressed. Yes, you can set it back to Caps Lock if you want, but not anything else.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Roccat Swarm key assignment\" class=\"wp-image-1998980\" height=\"753\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/swarm-key-assignment.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The lighting section offers a series of pre-programmed options, which are all gorgeous and far more fluid than the usual fare. But some are, frankly, overwhelming. I dare you to set the keyboard to &ldquo;Ripple,&rdquo; watch a full light show activate with each key press, and be able to get work done. But they&rsquo;re easy to both apply and customize, and you can fully program your own if that&rsquo;s what you want. All in all, not bad, especially considering how light-focused many buyers will be.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"should-you-buy-the-roccat-vulcan-ii\">Should you buy the Roccat Vulcan II?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>If you&rsquo;re interested in the Vulcan II, you want it for the insanely flashy light show it&rsquo;s providing.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At $150 the Vulcan II ain&rsquo;t cheap, especially for a board that foregoes some premium features like ultra-fancy switches, hot-swapping, or internal sound dampening. There are also some corners cut in terms of materials, like the fixed USB cable and a somewhat plasticky build, which can&rsquo;t be overcome by the admittedly nice inclusion of the wrist rest.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\" Roccat Vulcan II keyboard from the front\" class=\"wp-image-1998967\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DSC05125.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But even at this high price, it&rsquo;s not the most expensive wired-only board around &mdash; the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1916318/razer-blackwidow-v4-pro-keyboard-review.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Razer BlackWidow V4 is $80 more</a> without any huge technical advantages aside from ridiculously quick polling, for example. Corsair wants $200 for the K95 RGB Platinum SE, and its only advantage is five extra keys.&nbsp;Both those keyboards offer a better fit and finish, but not by such a huge margin that they can justify the higher price on that alone. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in the Vulcan II, you want it for the insanely flashy light show it&rsquo;s providing.

Stop me if this is getting too shocking for you. But that reductive intro doesn&rsquo;t tell the whole story, because there&rsquo;s a lot of engineering going on in the Vulcan II Mini Air beyond tossing a radio and a battery in the case and calling it a day.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The keyboard&rsquo;s phenomenal battery life makes wireless operation with its bombastic lighting enabled a real option, even if you&rsquo;re a power user. That&rsquo;s a commendable innovation, even if it only applies to a very niche kind of user. That niche is so specific &mdash; a small, premium, gaming, optical, wireless keyboard that can constantly dazzle you with RGB goodness &mdash; that it almost justifies the high price.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost. At the end of the day we&rsquo;re talking about a $180 for a mini keyboard, and for that kind of dough, you&rsquo;d better be delivering at all levels. It&rsquo;s out of consideration for most users, but for that tiny bit of the Venn diagram, it&rsquo;s worth it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><strong>Further reading:</strong> See our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/835195/best-wireless-gaming-keyboards.html\">best wireless gaming keyboards</a> to learn about competing products.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"whats-new-roccat-woah-woah-woah\">What&rsquo;s new, Roccat (woah woah woah)? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At first glance, not much has changed since I reviewed the Vulcan II Mini a year ago. You get the same 65% layout with full arrow keys, the same Titan II optical switches for fast, smooth operation, and the same &ldquo;floating&rdquo; keycaps that show off Roccat&rsquo;s best-in-class RGB lighting (along with the bright LEDs and transparent switch housing). The wireless version is about half an inch taller on the Y axis, just enough to put an illuminated Roccat logo above the keys. It also smartly shifts the USB-C port to the left, adds a power switch, and gives you a little bay to stow the 2.4GHz dongle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>The keyboard&rsquo;s battery life makes wireless operation with its lighting enabled a real option, even for power users.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Roccat Vucan II Mini Air logo\" class=\"wp-image-1998867\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DSC04723.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The keyboard is heavier than the Vulcan II Mini&hellip;but shockingly, not by much. On my kitchen scale the wired board is 17.7 ounces, while the wireless one (sans dongle) is 20.4 ounces. Roccat managed to cram wireless hardware and a battery in there with less than 3 ounces.&nbsp;For the sake of comparison, I threw the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1989585/corsair-k65-pro-mini-keyboard-review.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Corsair K65 Pro Mini</a> on the scale, which has the same 65% layout and optical switches but does <em>not have a radio or battery, </em>and it was a full ounce heavier than the Vulcan II Mini Air. Impressive! That kind of weight-saving makes the Roccat design an excellent portable board, though those floating keycaps mean you&rsquo;ll definitely want some kind of protective case on it before you throw it in a backpack. That&rsquo;s something the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394910/asus-rog-falchion-wireless-keyboard-review.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Asus Falchion</a> includes in the box, by the way.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Roccat Vucan II Mini Air from the side\" class=\"wp-image-1998865\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DSC04758.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>To reiterate what I wrote about the fully new, full-sized Vulcan II: Roccat is unbeatable when it comes to eye-popping RGB lights. In terms of brightness, visibility (thanks to those skinny keycaps), and animation, it&rsquo;s simply peerless at the moment. All the same things apply to the Vulcan II Mini Air&hellip;except that this little board is running on a battery.

That might not sound like much, so let me put it in context. One, remember that Roccat&rsquo;s lighting system is insane&mdash;the focus and definitely the highlight of the Vulcan series. And two, I&rsquo;m a heavy user to a possibly unhealthy degree. A standard mini keyboard running fully animated RGB lights will last me one day, maaaaaybe two if it&rsquo;s lucky.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Roccat Vucan II Mini Air USB port\" class=\"wp-image-1998863\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DSC04924.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>So when Roccat claims that this keyboard can last 150 hours (on the clock, not active usage) in its standard mode, or up to 750 hours with the RGB disabled, I&rsquo;m inclined to believe it. The specs don&rsquo;t say how big the battery is, but with just a few ounces of extra weight, it can&rsquo;t be capacious. This is, without qualification, the best battery life I&rsquo;ve ever seen from a gaming keyboard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And on top of that, Roccat managed a trick I rarely see: instant wake. With the 2.4GHz dongle, the keyboard instantly wakes up from sleep and starts shining, ready to input commands. Presumably this is due to the proximity sensors that the light show gets going even before you press a key, a very neat trick you need to experience in person to appreciate. I&rsquo;ve seen similar tech on <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1934170/logitech-mx-keys-s-review.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Logitech&rsquo;s MX Keys line</a>, but even those high-end boards don&rsquo;t boast this kind of insane battery life.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Roccat Vucan II Mini Air battery indicator\" class=\"wp-image-1998868\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DSC04807.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>One last note on the battery life. If you hold down the Fn key, the LED beneath the V key becomes your battery bar, gradually going from green to yellow to orange to red as the battery drains. A final warning, the V key and the Roccat logo flashing red, lets you know death is imminent. But even &ldquo;imminent&rdquo; is relative with such longevity &mdash; for me, it started flashing about two or three hours before it finally gave up the ghost. Impressive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-is-the-vulcan-mini-ii-air-for-gaming-and-typing\">How is the Vulcan Mini II Air for gaming and typing?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Like its non-wireless variant &mdash; and <em>unlike </em>the full-sized, wired Vulcan II &mdash; the Vulcan II Mini Air comes equipped with optical key switches. In contrast to a conventional mechanical keyboard switch that closes a circuit with an electrical contact, these detect a key press by interrupting a beam of light. This allows for (theoretically) super-fast performance and smooth, unhindered action from the top of the key press to the bottom, and back again.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roccat and Corsair both offer optical switches, giving us an opportunity to compare the Vulcan II Mini Air to the K65 Pro Mini. And in terms of typing and gaming, it isn&rsquo;t as good. Roccat&rsquo;s switches feel more loose and chattery, with more movement in the keycaps even when they&rsquo;re not being used. Throw in the flat, slippery ABS keycaps that Roccat uses on the Vulcan line versus the pleasantly rough PBT caps on the Corsair, and the latter is the clear winner in terms of typing and gaming &ldquo;feel,&rdquo; if not by an enormous margin.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Roccat Vucan II Mini Air switches\" class=\"wp-image-1998869\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DSC04778.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, you could always put PBT keycaps on the Vulcan. You could even put Corsair&rsquo;s keycaps on the Vulcan, since the layout is nearly identical. But then you wouldn&rsquo;t get the full benefit of Roccat&rsquo;s lighting system, and I doubt anyone interested in buying this board is willing to go that far. You also can&rsquo;t swap out the switches, but that&rsquo;s typical for optical designs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roccat&rsquo;s layout is also less intuitive than Corsair&rsquo;s, though both commit the cardinal sin, in my opinion, of an unmovable Fn button. The Vulcan II Mini Air is even more restrictive than most, as the Windows, Esc, and right Ctrl key are also off-limits. By default media keys are spread between Z and the period, sometimes necessitating two hands, and the Print Screen key is on the O, exactly one spot left of where it should be (in my mind, anyway).&nbsp;Of course all of this is configurable via software, with a second function layer available via the Easy Shift system (set to Caps Lock by default). But no amount of software can re-print the default layout onto the keys. There&rsquo;s no option for re-binding or programming macros on the fly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As far as gaming chops go, the Vulcan II Mini Air offers 1,000Hz polling and N-key rollover, more than any mere mortal could <s>want</s> make use of. With the exception of the slippery keycaps, I found it reasonably comfy, though I wish the single-stage keyboard feet had an option for a higher profile. I also think that for the price tag, an included and matching wrist rest isn&rsquo;t too much to ask for. After all, the Vulcan II &mdash; a cheaper, wired board &mdash; has one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Roccat Swarm for Vulcan II Mini Air\" class=\"wp-image-1998885\" height=\"753\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/roccat-swarm-mini-air.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Roccat&rsquo;s Swarm software is functional, if unspectacular. Like the Vulcan boards themselves, the big draw is the lighting, and all of the included defaults are both more interesting and much more smoothly animated than any of the competition. You can customize the speed, brightness, and color of each, and if that&rsquo;s not enough, program a fully custom system yourself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a wireless board Swarm has a little more to manage for this device, and it does so admirably. If you want even more extreme battery life you can adjust the sensitivity of the keyboard&rsquo;s proximity sensor or disable it entirely. Doing so means that the keyboard needs to wake from sleep, but it does so in a tiny fraction of a second, so it seems like a fair trade-off to me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>The Vulcan II Mini Air will delight your eyeballs with a light show that lasts for days.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"should-you-buy-the-roccat-vulcan-mini-ii-air\">Should you buy the Roccat Vulcan Mini II Air?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When I reviewed the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/808302/corsair-k70-rgb-pro-mini-wireless-keyboard-review.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$180 Corsair K70 Pro Mini Wireless</a>, I called its price sky-high and dinged it for a lack of value. The Roccat Vulcan II Mini Air is the same price, with a lot of the same features, like a choice of Bluetooth or 2.4GHz dongle wireless. So why do I think it&rsquo;s a much better deal?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of reasons. One, it&rsquo;s just a better board for traveling, being the same weight despite a larger layout that includes user-friendly arrow keys. It has faster optical switches, and it has an unbeatable battery life. That&rsquo;s true whether or not you prefer your gaming sessions illuminated, and if you do, the Vulcan II Mini Air will delight your eyeballs with a light show that lasts for days.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Roccat Vucan II Mini Air lighting\" class=\"wp-image-1998866\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DSC04855.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, $180 is still a lot of money for a keyboard, especially one that&rsquo;s this small and doesn&rsquo;t come with extras like a wrist rest or case. So it&rsquo;s only worth it for a very specific kind of gamer. That gamer is one who wants that beautiful RGB goodness, wants it to last a long, long time, and is okay with switches, keycaps, and layout that aren&rsquo;t the best around.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If those caveats don&rsquo;t bother you, the Vulcan II Mini Air is worth the high asking price for a super-portable board that takes its light show on the road.&nbsp;</p>\n\nKeyboards</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1997426/roccat-vulcan-ii-mini-air-keyboard-review.html", "date_published": "2023-07-19T10:30:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Google experiments with AI backgrounds in Meet", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Three years after the pandemic, it feels like we&rsquo;ve reached the endgame for funny Zoom backgrounds. Google has begun testing AI-generated backgrounds in Google Meet, something that Microsoft inevitably will follow in Teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not everyone has this feature turned on. Google has only made AI backgrounds available to those who are currently part of its Workspace Labs program, the beta program to test out new features in Meet and other Google apps. But the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.google.com/meet/answer/13784433&amp;xcust=2-3-1999193-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">support document</a> with instructions has already hit the web, with the implication that it will publicly debut before long.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2000, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/398920/how-to-make-a-funny-zoom-background-to-entertain-your-friends-and-coworkers.html\">creating a funny Zoom background</a> became the rage for a short time, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/398991/how-to-use-animated-gifs-as-backgrounds-in-zoom-video.html\">followed by making an animated GIF</a> &mdash; including <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/398997/best-funny-zoom-background-trick-put-yourself-in-a-looping-video-so-you-can-skip-the-meeting.html\">looping the background GIF</a> to make it seem like, <em>Mission: Impossible</em>-style, that you were actually there when you weren&rsquo;t. Two years later, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/788422/how-to-get-started-with-ai-art-dall-e-mini-ai-dungeon-and-more.html\">AI art</a> became the new fad, with innovations like <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1666493/hands-on-with-bing-image-creator-bing-chats-ai-art-tool.html\">Bing Image Creator</a> allowing you to create custom illustrations on the fly. Google, somewhat oddly, has been behind the curve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until now, that is. According to the Google support document, it looks like you&rsquo;ll be able to &ldquo;create&rdquo; a background, just like you&rsquo;re able to use a custom background in Meet today. If you review the Meet backgrounds (when joining a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://meet.google.com&amp;xcust=2-3-1999193-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Meet</a> meeting, click the &ldquo;sparkle&rdquo; tab to adjust your background) you&rsquo;ll already see a host of slightly animated backgrounds that look like they&rsquo;ve been generated from AI, like so:</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Google Meet castle\" class=\"wp-image-1999197\" height=\"664\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Google-Meet-castle-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>What Meet is adding to this is simply a window to create your own background, using AI. Instead of selecting an existing background, you&rsquo;ll have the option of typing in a scene, such as a magical forest, and selecting a style from the drop-down menu. There is a &ldquo;3D animation&rdquo; option that appears in the drop-down menu box in Google&rsquo;s example, but it&rsquo;s unclear whether the result will actually be animated, as some of Google&rsquo;s current Meet backgrounds are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Naturally, you&rsquo;ll still have the opportunity to use your standard &ldquo;real world&rdquo; background, including the option to blur it, too. Here&rsquo;s what Meet&rsquo;s AI backgrounds will look like, compliments of <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/ArtemR/status/1681342368233160707&amp;xcust=2-3-1999193-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Artem Russakovskii</a> of Android Police:</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Google Meet animated backgrounds\" class=\"wp-image-1999203\" height=\"410\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Meet-animated-backgrounds.gif\" width=\"654\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Google</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google&rsquo;s new AI backgrounds in Meet certainly feel like something Microsoft accidentally passed over, so you should expect that Google&rsquo;s rivals will follow suit.

These include the retail storefronts of popular computer manufacturers such as HP, Dell, and Lenovo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you are looking in between sales periods, it&rsquo;s generally a good idea to search through large third-party retailers such as Amazon, Adorama, Walmart, BestBuy, and Newegg. Oftentimes these websites will offer limited Deals of the Day type sales in hopes of getting rid of excess stock. On the upside, you can score still-decent PCs at a steep discount.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n\nDesktop PCs, Gaming PCs</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/813362/best-pc-computer-deals.html", "date_published": "2023-07-19T01:53:24+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}]
