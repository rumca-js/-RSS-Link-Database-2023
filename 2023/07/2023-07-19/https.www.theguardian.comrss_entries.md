<p>The lawyer trades on his family’s image while spreading dangerous ideas. No wonder Republicans hype his bid for the Democratic nomination</p><p>Robert F Kennedy Jr, campaigning to be the Democratic nominee for the presidency, likes to call himself a “Kennedy Democrat”. His own siblings <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/17/robert-f-kennedy-jr-covid-condemned" title="">disagree</a>. His uncle’s presidency, like his namesake father’s career and presidential campaign, had an aura of hope and responsibility as well as glamour. RFK Jr talks vaguely of overcoming divisions, but in reality trades upon a peculiar blend of “cynicism and credulity”, as one commentator <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/30/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-coalition-supporters.html" title="">notes</a>. Most recently he claimed that “Covid-19 is targeted to attack Caucasians and black people. The people who are most immune are Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese,” in comments <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/07/15/rfk-jr-says-covid-was-ethnically-targeted-to-spare-jews/" title="">reported</a> by the New York Post.</p><p>However jarring the remarks – he partially backtracked later – they sit comfortably with his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/19/robert-kennedy-jr-racist-antisemitic-xenophobic-views" title="">long history</a> of fomenting conspiracy theories and his nonsensical, anti-scientific views. He has falsely linked childhood immunisations to autism and wifi to cancer and “leaky brain”, claimed that HIV does not cause Aids, and suggested that chemicals in drinking water could make children transgender. One of his sisters warned that his latest comments put people’s lives in danger.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/19/the-guardian-view-on-robert-f-kennedy-jr-from-camelot-to-conspiracy-mongering">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A record number of tickets have been sold in Australia and New Zealand, as the women’s game continues to grow in popularity across the world</p><p>When the inaugural Fifa-backed Women’s World Cup <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtpYkNGulrQ" title="">took place</a> in 1991, the tournament was given a weird title designed to distance it from the “real” competition – the one played by men.

<p>A new documentary looks back on the highs and lows of the mysterious Pink Floyd co-founder, troubled but too often misunderstood</p><p>In rock star portraiture, it behooves a writer to avoid straightforward presentation of cliche. The story of a troubled virtuoso tormented by their own genius, turning to drink and drugs, then flaming out before their time has been told over and over again. And so in the making of Have You Got It Yet?, his new documentary about the Pink Floyd cofounder Syd Barrett, director Roddy Bogawa faced the peculiar task of fighting the ready-made drama of a man whose life story sounds like legend.</p><p>Barrett led the group as guitarist and vocalist when they dubbed themselves The Pink Floyd Sound in 1965, and he spearheaded the creation of their groundbreaking debut album Piper at the Gates of Dawn two years later. But erratic behavior stemming from his deteriorating mental health had alienated his fellow band members, and ultimately led to his unceremonious dismissal not long afterward. There were murmurs that LSD had liquefied his brain, leaving him to slowly descend into madness while secluding himself in his country home. In the popular imagination, he became a symbol of squandered potential and larger-than-life tragedy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/19/syd-barrett-pink-floyd-documentary">Continue reading...</a>

Having left the cracked utopia of Barbieland, she’s rollerblading on the boardwalk at Venice Beach with her hopelessly neutered boyfriend Ken (a peroxide-blonde Ryan Gosling) in tow. Both are wearing garishly bright spandex get-ups complete with neon yellow kneepads – outfits anyone with social media brain will recognize from the earliest public images of these two Hollywood stars as mononymous, backstory-less toys. Filmed in public, the paparazzi shots were the first trickle of extra-textual Barbie content before the hot pink tsunami of this summer’s inescapable, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/17/barbie-the-movie-hot-pink-mania">seismic marketing campaign</a>.</p><p>Anyway, the uncomfortable feeling. As it was during filming, people are looking at Barbie and Ken, these two strange creatures on the boardwalk. Barbie, accustomed to adoration and comically unversed in any vocabulary outside preternaturally sunny empowerment, notes that she feels weird. Like … conscious of something … but thinking of herself. The moment is played for laughs – what if an adult woman (of sorts) made it this far without ever experiencing self-consciousness? What if the concept of self-doubt was so foreign as to escape language? – and as part of the film’s absurd, at times strenuously winking tone.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/19/barbie-movie-mattel-greta-gerwig-ryan-gosling">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sam was lured to a fake job interview, raped, then trafficked for months. When she reported it to the Met, they tried to drop the case, but she didn’t give up</p><p>In April 2018, Sam was in her mid-20s and had recently arrived in London from New Zealand. Having run out of money, she went to an interview for work as an escort, which is where she met Nuruzzaman Shahin. He took her passport, told her he needed to inspect her body as part of the interview, locked her in a room in which she was dimly aware of camera equipment and raped her. She found out soon afterwards that he had also raped another woman, Gabrielle, and a third, Hannah. More survivors would continue to surface.</p><p>From this point on, she was trafficked by Shahin; that is a matter of fact, settled in a later case by the Home Office, yet he has never been charged with trafficking Sam, or anyone else.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/19/were-not-all-broken-the-woman-who-pursued-her-rapist-for-five-years-and-won">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘I wondered if the two couples were part of the same family, and if it was the men or women who were going away. There’s a lot of ambiguity’ </p><p>I could never pick a favourite shot, or a best one. This is actually a photograph that almost didn’t make it into my <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/23/photie-man-50-years-of-tom-wood-review-walker-art-gallery-liverpool">current exhibition</a>, but I was looking at it while I was preparing for the opening and asked a few visitors what they thought. One of them, an elderly lady, said: “Is it a greeting, or is it parting?” The more she looked at the picture the more she thought it didn’t show some casual separation – someone going away for the weekend – it seemed to be more than that. Another woman said: “It’s ageless love, basically, isn’t it? Ageless love is what’s there.” I wondered myself if the two couples were part of the same family, and if it was the women who were going away; they’re the ones with the bags. There’s a lot of ambiguity.</p><p>I have a camera with me all the time. When I made this picture, in around 2017, I’d been teaching in Colwyn Bay and was at the train station on my way home. It was evening, and the camera was in my hand as I waited on the platform. As the train came in, rather than just jumping on, I was still paying attention to what was happening nearby. I wandered around and took a few pictures, trying to be invisible, and then carried on once I was on board, photographing landscapes out the window.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jul/19/four-lovers-kiss-on-a-railway-platform-tom-woods-best-photograph">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Never mind heaving bosoms and whimpering grunts, some writers – from Sally Rooney to DH Lawrence – depict genuine, sometimes graphic, intimacy in all its forms</p><p>The hotly publicised Bad sex in fiction awards return this winter and I for one have sorely missed its moist nipples, whimpering grunts and so forth. Good sex is, of course, subjective. Good sex in literature even more so. What can make one person cringe can make another, well, never mind. I’ve often wondered how the literary novelists get genuine intimacy on to the page. What alchemy goes into conjuring a tender coming-of-age experience or a wildly passionate, perhaps even distasteful, moment?</p><p>The distinction between “good” and “humorous” sex became clear to me when writing my satirical novel of scandalous goings-on in Westminster, <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/whips-9781472157263">Whips</a>. I saved my silly scenes about vibrating eggs until after 6pm when a stiff martini could help. We all have our kinks, but I’m pretty sure “naughty Tory MP” is as niche as it gets. As much as I tried to bring the reader in on the joke rather than into the bedroom, I fear I might make the shortlist of the awards this year simply on principle.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/19/top-10-good-sex-in-fiction-cleo-watson">Continue reading...</a>

## Dave: this rap comedy is one of the funniest, most nuanced TV shows around

<p>The semi-autobiographical story of a calamitous rapper is a celeb-packed, hilarious watch. It’s one of the most sorely overlooked things on television</p><p>For British viewers, the big television debut of the week is undoubtedly The Bear; a beautifully crafted, critically acclaimed series that has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/14/the-bear-the-best-show-of-2022-is-back-and-its-the-perfect-example-of-how-to-ace-a-second-series">effortlessly vaulted</a> into the ranks of the best shows ever made. Last month, it was announced that The Bear was the most-watched single season of a comedy series in FX history, and that US viewership for the second season had increased by 70%. In other words, all eyes on The Bear.</p><p>But while all this (justified) hype whirls and loops around The Bear, spare a thought for Dave. Dave is another FX show that also debuts a new season on Disney+ today. And to make matters worse, it was FX’s most-watched comedy series until The Bear came along. Thanks to a genuinely weird scheduling quirk, Dave has found itself relegated to underdog status. This is a shame, because I haven’t been looking forward to a new season of anything this much for ages. You know, except for the obvious.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/19/dave-this-rap-comedy-is-one-of-the-funniest-most-nuanced-tv-shows-around">Continue reading...</a>

## Big Caesars and Little Caesars by Ferdinand Mount review – rogue’s gallery

<p> A needle-sharp book about political liabilities from Julius Caesar to Boris Johnson</p><p>One by one, the toxic giants have come crashing to earth. In the last month or so Boris Johnson has quit, Donald Trump has been arraigned on felony charges, Italy’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/12/silvio-berlusconi-obituary" title="">Silvio Berlusconi</a> has died, and even Vladimir Putin looks significantly weaker than he did. It’s sorely tempting to conclude that the chaotic ride of recent years is finally over, and life might return to something more like normal.</p><p>But that, according to Ferdinand Mount’s absorbing tour of populist rogues through the ages, would be a rookie mistake. It may be comforting to think of so-called Caesars – a type of leader defined by what Mount calls his (and it’s mostly, though not invariably, his) “relentless egotism, his lack of scruple, his thoughtless brutality, his cheesy glitz” and above all his loathing of democratic checks and balances – as freakish aberrations from a generally orderly norm. But trace the line from ancient Rome to Oliver Cromwell, from Napoleon Bonaparte to modern-day strongmen, and it becomes obvious that they are a regularly recurring phenomenon for which nations just as regularly fall, and from which they don’t recover overnight. “These ill-starred comets,” Mount writes, “leave a long trail of debris.” But they also have something to teach us about stopping the next Caesar early.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/19/big-caesars-and-little-caesars-by-ferdinand-mount-review-rogues-gallery">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Cornwall Youth Noise Orchestra sounds like the harsh end of 80s industrial and freaks out even their teachers. Ahead of a major concert, we visit their adventurous sound lab </p><p>It’s Wednesday afternoon, and the scene in a room on the campus of Falmouth university looks like after-school clubs the country over: a handful of teens, some enveloped in hoodies, some eating crisps and sweets; a couple of tutors. There the similarity ends. The desks are piled with an array of electronic music-making equipment: oscillators, modular synthesisers, a visibly homemade “white noise machine”, pens with contact microphones attached to them, an old four-track Portastudio connected to a series of effects pedals, a DJ turntable playing sound-effects records. Intermittent squeaks, whooshes and honks emerge as the teenagers start fiddling with them. A selection of microphones hang from a beam: swinging over small amplifiers on the floor, they produce squeals of feedback that shift in and out of phase, an idea borrowed from Steve Reich’s Pendulum Music, a 1968 piece subsequently covered by both Sonic Youth and Aphex Twin, who hails from just a few miles away.</p><p>This is a rehearsal by the <a href="https://www.moogiewonderland.co.uk/category/cornwall-youth-noise-orchestra">Cornwall Youth Noise Orchestra</a>, the brainchild of Matt Ashdown and Liz Howell of Moogie Wonderland, which began as a club night and now bills itself as “a participatory arts organisation”.

## Has Barbie killed the indie director? Credible film-makers are shamelessly selling out | Caspar Salmon

<p>One-time indie cinema darling Greta Gerwig is now using IP to make money for a megabucks toy company that sells vacuous, hypersexualised dolls – and no one bats an eyelid</p><p>In the early 90s, according to a story that may now have become slightly mythologised in the retelling, the actor Sarah Polley – then aged 12 – was asked by Disney executives to remove a peace sign badge she was wearing. When she refused, Disney blacklisted her. This story lost a little of its potency last month with the announcement that Polley was set <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/13/sarah-polley-disney-live-action-bambi-remake">to direct the new “live-action” reboot of Bambi</a>. For admirers of Polley’s determinedly independent career, the record-scratch noise could not be louder: this is somebody who worked with Atom Egoyan, David Cronenberg and <em>Hal Hartley for </em><em>God’s sake</em>, before the age of 22.</p><p>Thoughts of Polley returned this week with the now-deafening noise surrounding the release of Barbie, directed by another former queen of independent cinema, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/09/it-had-to-be-totally-bananas-greta-gerwig-on-bringing-barbie-back-to-life">Greta Gerwig</a>. Coming up a few years after Polley, Gerwig was so indie that her films didn’t even go to Sundance, they went to South by Southwest. She was so indie that when she moved from micro-budget mumblecore movies to a scripted film with Noah Baumbach – Greenberg, in 2010 – the Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jun/05/greta-gerwig-greenberg-mumblecore">called it</a> “her first tentative steps into the mainstream”. Greenberg was made for a budget of $25m, which it didn’t make back; now Gerwig has directed Barbie, for the film arm of mega-corporation Mattel, with a budget of $145m. Gerwig’s swerve into the<em> actual</em> mainstream prompts the question: does the phrase “selling out” have any meaning any more?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/19/barbie-indie-director-film-maker-greta-gerwig">Continue reading...</a>

Another was on developers’ use of tactics <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/14/video-games-gambling-big-spenders">from the gambling industry</a> to keep people spending on games. The third was by the director of the National Centre for Gaming Disorders, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/14/i-was-not-prepared-for-what-we-came-across-when-treating-gaming-disorders">calling for industry regulation</a> to better protect young people.</p><p>These stories concern a problem that is certainly real, especially so for people affected by compulsive gaming behaviour, whose stories are no less affecting than those of gambling addicts. They also highlight a need for mechanisms to help struggling people. For adults, it is possible to exclude yourself from casinos and lock yourself out of online gambling accounts, should you request it; no such possibility exists if you’re finding yourself dropping thousands on a free-to-play mobile game instead. For under-18s, the paucity of help available to families and young people struggling with social isolation or destructive behaviour at home, of which compulsive gaming can be a part, is one fact of a youth mental health crisis across the UK, where 250,000 young people <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/apr/16/buckling-nhs-fails-to-treat-250000-children-with-mental-health-problems">are going without help</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jul/19/pushing-buttons-game-addiction-gambling-industry-parents">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Record blazes have left crews struggling to contain aggressive burns, with a shortage of personnel making things worse</p><p>Earlier this summer, a wildfire crept – and then sprinted – towards Fox Creek, a community of less than 2,000 in north-west Alberta.

<p>The thousands of strikers are at the frontlines of two key battles: against a future controlled by AI, and against suffocating inequality</p><p>We’re having quite an apocalyptic summer. Wildfire smoke chokes the air of major cities. Amid a brutal heatwave, striking workers muster picket lines on scorching streets. The screenwriters of the Writers Guild of America (WGA) have been on strike for nearly three months. Last week they were joined by 160,000 members of Sag-Aftra, the actors’ union. Hollywood is closed for business. Everyone is scared that artificial intelligence could steal away our jobs. It’s hot. Tempers are short. The whole entertainment industry is out of work and angry and ready to lean into class war. It feels a little scary. It feels a little giddy. It feels like anything might happen this year.</p><p>This is good.

The position comes naturally: she has been a “faithful and perennial servant” to her siblings since infancy. But her brother soon departs, leaving her alone to struggle with the traumatic legacy of a vaguely outlined past event.</p><p>She quickly learns that the inhabitants of the nearby small town all hate her. Or fear her. Mothers cover their children’s eyes when she passes. At a cafe, unable to speak the language, the narrator points at a woman’s coffee cup and she bursts into tears while other customers surreptitiously make the sign of the cross. Later a shopkeeper crouches behind his counter in “some manner of defensive manoeuvre” while the narrator browses the shelves.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/19/study-for-obedience-by-sarah-bernstein-review-life-in-limbo">Continue reading...</a>

With bells on. TWIOAT (as we hardcore stans call it) sees NZ comedians Tim Batt and Guy Montgomery watch the same film every week, for a year. This format quickly descends into delirium, in-jokes, self-introspection and a healthy dose of self-loathing. They’ve covered Grown Ups 2, Sex and the City 1 and 2, We Are Your Friends as well as triumphal miniseries on Cats, Dr Dolittle and even a foray into TV with And Just Like That. They are beloved around the world with a particularly big following in the US – no mean feat in this day and age.

<p>Try That in a Small Town features lyrics threatening violence against protesters and has been removed from Country Music Television, but Aldean says it is a celebration of community</p><p>Jason Aldean, one of the biggest stars of US country music, has been widely criticised for a new song and video, Try That in a Small Town, which features threats of violence against police protesters.</p><p>The song’s lyrics include the lines: “Cuss out a cop, spit in his face / Stomp on the flag and light it up / Yeah, you think you’re tough / Well, try that in a small town / See how far you make it down the road / Around here, we take care of our own.”</p><p>Try That In a Small Town, for me, refers to the feeling of a community that I had growing up, where we took care of our neighbors, regardless of differences of background or belief. Because they were our neighbours, and that was above any differences. My political views have never been something I’ve hidden from, and I know that a lot of us in this Country don’t agree on how we get back to a sense of normalcy where we go at least a day without a headline that keeps us up at night. But the desire for it to – that’s what this song is about.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/19/country-star-jason-aldean-try-that-in-a-small-town-song">Continue reading...</a>

## Children need to understand the world around them. Why shouldn’t they know about white privilege? | Nelson Abbey

<p>Schools in Britain have been criticised by the right for wanting an honest debate. Instead, they should be applauded</p><p><br />No one really knows what the critical race theory bogeyman looks or sounds like or what he wants, yet everyone is being told how dangerous he is. He is responsible for every wrong-think we may have about race, racism and racial discourse. CRT has become shorthand for every bad, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/23/uk-critical-race-theory-trump-conservatives-structural-inequality">inconvenient or unacceptable cultural thought invading us from </a>the US, even if the thoughts don’t permeate from the US, or if they are mostly relevant to Britain. Be afraid of the bogeyman: be very afraid.</p><p>Last week I went on TalkTV to discuss the decision by some Church of England schools to teach about white privilege. Asked what white privilege is, I explained that it is the lack of societal obstacles associated with being white. I further elaborated that it doesn’t mean you will not face obstacles in life: it means that any difficulty, challenge or hardship you face is unlikely to be a result of your skin colour if you are white. By comparison, I as a man, for example, face many pressing issues in society, yet none of them are related to or rooted in me being a man.

## Reeves says tackling child poverty ‘in Labour’s DNA’ as row over its two-child benefit cap policy continues – UK politics live

<p>Shadow chancellor says an incoming Labour government could not afford to axe benefit cap because of ‘dire economic inheritance’</p><p>In her Today interview Rachel Reeves said that tackling child poverty was “at the heart” of <a href="https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mission-breaking-down-barriers.pdf">the document</a> published by Labour earlier this month setting out details of its ‘breaking down barriers to opportunity’ mission.

The document runs to 22 pages, but the phrase “child poverty” only appears three times, in this passage.</p><p><strong>Child poverty reduction:</strong> Dedicated professionals across our education system go above and beyond every day to deliver for our children, but the barriers that too many children face – from the lack of a secure home, to not having books to read or pens to draw with – are not theirs to fix.</p><p>As part of the Opportunity Mission cross-government task force, we will involve child poverty reduction specialists at the heart of this work. Labour will put a focus on reducing child poverty at the centre of how we secure opportunity for children and young people from every background and every corner of our country.</p><p>Tackling child poverty is in Labour’s DNA. When we were last in government, under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, hundreds of thousands of children and pensioners were lifted out of poverty. Keir Starmer and Bridget Phillipson set out our opportunity mission just a couple of weeks ago. Child poverty was at the heart of that.</p><p>The truth is there’s more than six things that an incoming Labour government won’t be able to do. We’re going to have the most dire economic inheritance of any incoming government. The level of debt in the UK economy is the same size as everything we produce in the economy on an annual basis. Our interest rates and inflation are a staggering high levels and our economy is barely growing. It’s barely grown these last 13 years …</p><p>It is our duty to get control of the public finances and ensure we’ve got a stable economy. It’s not a ‘nice to have’, it is the rock of stability upon which all other policies have to be built. There will be nothing in a Labour manifesto there’s not fully costed and fully funded.</p><p>Tackling child poverty is in Labour’s DNA.

<p>Prisoners fight for survival on reality TV in an exuberant dystopia of doomed love and industrialised racism</p><p>Chain-Gang All-Stars is an exuberant circus of a novel, action-packed and expansive, almost too much to process. It plays out in a dystopian US just a shuffle-step from the norm, where predominantly Black prisoners fight not just for the entertainment of a primetime TV audience but, indirectly, for the reader’s benefit too. The narrative explodes in all directions. The tale at the centre is sometimes obscured. The book is unruly and knowingly compromised but it comes fuelled by a sense of thrilling, righteous rage.</p><p>Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah landed an ardent fanbase with his bestselling 2018 debut, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/31/friday-black-nana-kwame-adjei-brenyah-review-bernardine-evaristo" title="">Friday Black</a>, a collection of speculative short stories depicting a culture in which bargain-crazed consumers attack the local department store, and white tourists at a theme park pay for the pleasure of shooting the Black staff. Chain-Gang All-Stars also began life as a short story before blowing up out of all proportion, like the proverbial mosquito that accidentally taps an artery, to the point where its high-concept conceit becomes a conduit for the intertwined horrors of privatised prisons, reality TV and the Wagner group’s army of convicts in Ukraine.

<p>Walking Barney opened up a world of spontaneity and sensitivity. And I’ve met so many people …</p><p>In the bitter gloom of the new year, my semi-hibernating brain produced this feeble logic: I like looking at dogs in the local park, therefore I might like walking dogs around parks. As I say, it was cold. The sofa and I had become one. Signing up to a dog-borrowing website, one of several in the UK, I posted a quick profile and soon enough met a local co-owner of a small dog, Barney. This crossbreed of many types of terrier was mostly uninterested in the encounter. Still, the following week, I took Barney out for our first solo walk. And this short outing transformed me, instantly, into a dog lover.</p><p>Barney was immediately captivating up close: the way he launched into the world, twitchy snout first; the way he suddenly stopped still to track a scent in the wind; his loud snuffling as he sniffed the ground, one paw raised in the air. I liked how he bounced through grass and trotted along paths, how he flipped from clownishly comedic one moment to sleek and graceful the next. I was, in short, smitten by the sheer doggyness of this dog.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/19/a-moment-that-changed-me-i-borrowed-a-dog-and-discovered-a-healthier-happier-way-of-life">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It is 50 years since this prehistoric thoroughfare in southern England became a national trail. We take a two-day walk with highlights including Uffington White Horse</p><p>I’m settled in the shade of a hawthorn bush at the edge of the trail. Banked cow parsley waves in the breeze, elderflowers are breaking bud and the white chalk line of the footpath draws the eye on through the landscape. As I sit, a hare hops out of the hedge just metres away and pauses on the path. For a long moment it is still and calm, eyes shining golden. I hold my breath. Then it notices me and bursts into action, launching off the track and through the undergrowth to the field beyond, quicker than my eyes can follow. I exhale. Walks are made for moments like these.</p><p>I’m walking a stretch of the <a href="https://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/en_GB/trails/the-ridgeway/">Ridgeway national trail</a> across the high chalklands of the <a href="https://www.northwessexdowns.org.uk/">North Wessex Downs</a>, an area of outstanding natural beauty.

<p>Forty years after Wham! hit the big time, Ridgeley reflects on the joy of starting a successful band with his childhood best friend. He took second billing – but never with bitterness</p><p>Live Aid, 1985. In front of 72,000 people and a global audience of more than a billion, George Michael is on the brink of superstardom. He is sharing a stage with Elton John, but really everyone’s eyes are on Michael. There is a lovely moment – one of many – in the great new <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/17/wham-review-netflix-george-michael-andrew-ridgeley-80s-pop">Wham! documentary</a>, when the camera is on Andrew Ridgeley, relegated to singing backing vocals and positioned somewhere behind Elton’s piano. Ridgeley’s expression is of pure pride and love. There doesn’t seem to be any hint of jealousy in his joyful, beaming face, or sadness that his childhood friend is moving away from him – Michael would become a solo artist the following year.</p><p>Nearly 40 years later, Ridgeley is sitting in a room at the Sony offices in London. The Netflix documentary has been a hit, and Ridgeley has been immersed in Wham!, the band he created with Michael as teenagers, for the last few years. There’s also a 40th anniversary rerelease of Wham! singles coming, and he would love to do something with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/11/tell-us-have-you-kept-a-pop-music-scrapbook-wham">51 wonderful, meticulous scrapbooks</a> his mother kept, which feature heavily in the documentary. He is wiry and boyish, articulate but not particularly given to introspection. He will talk and talk about the process of putting together Wham!’s two albums, but on emotional matters – such as Michael’s death in 2016 – he becomes more detached. “Like all losses, one learns to manage them and one comes to terms … ” he says, trailing off.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/19/oh-god-i-envied-his-voice-andrew-ridgeley-on-ego-angst-and-loving-george-michael">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Women’s cricket has grown in incremental steps for a long time – this series shows making the leap to big grounds is the best tactic</p><p>The Women’s Ashes has a long history of close contests, drawn series and match-defining moments that have kept spectators on the edge of their seats. But in 2011, only a handful of people were at Bankstown Oval to witness Alex Blackwell’s bold declaration and Rene Farrell’s decisive hat-trick that swung the match in Australia’s favour and secured their first Ashes win since 2003.</p><p>What has changed most since then is not the cricket itself, but the number of people paying attention and, crucially, the number of spectators through the gates. Ground upgrades to venues such as the picturesque North Sydney Oval and Manuka Oval in Australia and the County Ground in Taunton, England have helped pave the way for this growth and more fans have been drawn in.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jul/19/success-of-womens-ashes-spectacle-shifts-the-dial-in-a-major-way">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Women’s World Cup kicks off on Thursday. The former England star Karen Carney discusses why this is an opportunity for investment that the sport cannot afford to miss</p><p>The biggest ever Women’s World Cup kicks off on Thursday in Australia and New Zealand for what promises to be a month of highly competitive football. The US once again begin the tournament as favourites and there will be considerable expectation on England as European champions. However, England arrive in Australia depleted by injuries to star players such as Leah Williamson and Beth Mead.</p><p>As the former England player <strong>Karen Carney </strong>tells <strong>Hannah Moore, </strong>the tournament will once again provide a springboard for the women’s game and an opportunity to grow that it cannot afford to miss. Carney has recently released a government-commissioned review of the women’s game in England. She says she is shocked at some of the poor facilities women have to use, as well as misogynistic attitudes she had hoped were a thing of the past in the sport.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/jul/19/world-cup-future-of-womens-football-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
