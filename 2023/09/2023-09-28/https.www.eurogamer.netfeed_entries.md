Five years after its initial unveiling, developer Mojang has confirmed development on Minecraft Dungeons has reached its end, and that the game's 1.17 update - which released ten months ago, back in November 2023 - will be its last.
</p><p>
Minecraft Dungeons, a collaboration between Mojang and developer Double Eleven, was well-received when it launched in May 2020 - Eurogamer's Tom Phillips <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-dungeons-review-a-diablo-like-thats-just-deep-enough">called it</a> a "strong extension to the franchise, and by far the most promising Minecraft spin-off released to date" at the time.

Being sneaky and as sly as that proverbial fox is about to get even more up close and personal (well, for those on PlayStation - I know others have had this experience already). 
</p><p>
Earlier today, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/09/28/among-us-vr-is-coming-to-ps-vr2/">InnerSloth, Sony, Schell Games and Robot Teddy</a> announced that social deduction game Among Us will be coming to PS VR2. So, get ready to grab your Crewmates and then subsequently betray them all with the quick slice here and a subtle tongue impaling here. You know, as you do. 
</p><p>
When Among Us makes its way onto PS VR2, players can expect the usual likes of tasks, sabotages, venting, and those frantic emergency meetings where accusations begin to fly left, right and centre. But in addition to all this, Among Us VR on PS VR2 will also

It's an extremely complex, multi-stage form of lying, basically. You have a good trick, but to make it great, you go around and you spot any avenues of thinking which could lead the audience to work out how it might be done, and then you lock these avenues off, one at a time. It's misdirection, but a sort of nth dimension misdirection.</p><p>Cocoon does something similar. Or maybe it's the same thing but through the looking glass, inverted, turned upside down. If magicians close the doors of possibility to stop you from solving a puzzle, Cocoon closes all necessary doors in order to help you solve one. It's closing the doors not in the name of misdirection but, well, direction. And it does it so skilfully I almost always miss those doors closing in the first place.</p><p>This is

Microsoft has introduced a new update across Xbox that aims to simplify users' experiences when they set about backing up their game captures.
</p><p>
With this update in play, any captures stored on the Xbox network will now be deleted after 90 days. Users can check on their captures' status via the  Captures app, where any images coming close to that 90 day limit will be flagged. 
</p><p>
As is apparent with this "new retention approach", Xbox users will need to ensure any captures they wish to keep for more than that 90 day period are backed up elsewhere or risk losing them forever.

A new order, released yesterday, states the FTC has "determined that the public interest warrants that this matter be resolved fully and expeditiously. Therefore, the Commission is returning this matter to adjudication".

As a reminder, the European Commission announced plans back in 2017 to investigate Valve and the aforementioned PC game publishers over suspected anti-competitive practices.
