Versatile actor with a magnificent presence who starred in The Singing Detective and the Harry Potter films<p>The word “great” is somewhat promiscuously applied to actors. But it was undoubtedly deserved by Sir Michael Gambon, who has died aged 82 after suffering from pneumonia.</p><p>He had weight, presence, authority, vocal power and a chameleon-like ability to reinvent himself from one role to another. He was a natural for heavyweight classic roles such as Lear and Othello. But what was truly remarkable was Gambon’s interpretative skill in the work of the best contemporary dramatists, including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/dec/27/harold-pinter-obituary-playwright-politics" title="">Harold Pinter</a>, Alan Ayckbourn, David Hare, Caryl Churchill and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/aug/07/simongray.theatre" title="">Simon Gray</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/sep/28/michael-gambon-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

Perhaps their team has been promoted or relegated, perhaps there have been new signings, or a new manager, bringing the promise of a fresh start and fresh possibilities. But once inside the ground, those fans have a drink with the same old pals, take their usual seat surrounded by recognisable faces before the familiar voice of the announcer rings out over the PA, followed by the club’s traditional song. At that point those fans will realise: nothing has really changed. This is football as it ever was and ever will be.</p><p>That’s also how it feels when switching on EA Sports

During the day, I placed my phone in a ziplock bag and stashed it in the unlit fireplace, then, late at night, abjectly clawed it back out. I understood why writers in the past cut modem lines and severed fibre optic cables, but I told myself it was OK to be on the internet as I was writing a novel about the internet, that semio
