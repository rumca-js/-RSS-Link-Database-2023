		Crossing the border at Curaçao and the U.S. is about to get easier for some, thanks to biometric-backed digital ID programs.
<h2>Curaçao announces pre-flight digital ID verification</h2>
The government of Curaçao, in conjunction with Curaçao Airport Holding, has <a href="https://www.vision-box.com/press-release/curacao-announces-worlds-first-pre-flight-biometric-digital-id-verification">announced</a> that it has selected <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/airside-mobile">Airside</a>, a privacy-based digital identity-sharing provider, and <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/vision-box">Vision-Box</a>, a biometric-based travel technology company, to create the world’s first mobile-based, pre-enrollment border crossing system.

		Schools in the U.S. state of New York cannot buy or use facial recognition.

Some schools <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202007/facial-biometrics-in-new-york-state-schools-blocked-as-legislature-passes-2-year-moratorium">had deployed </a>cameras and AI algorithms, prompting protests from privacy advocates, facial recognition opponents, some students' parents and state politicians.

<h2>Buenos Aires leads with QuarkID</h2>
Argentina’s capital city, Buenos Aires, is leaning into a new <a href="https://blockworks.co/news/buenos-aires-government-id-ethereum-zksync">blockchain</a> system that promises citizens faster and more reliable access to their most important government documents.

The new service, QuarkID, created in partnership with blockchain digital identity company Extrimian, is set to be released in October. QuarkID will act as a private digital wallet, giving users access to digitally verifiable versions of documents like certificates for birth, mar

		DPI development investor Co-Develop announced an investment in <a href="https://www.opencrvs.org/">OpenCRVS</a>, a standards-based open source software that gives governments the power to establish a record for Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) data which can include births, deaths, marriages, divorces, and adoptions.

CRVS systems play an essential role in DPI by supporting the issuing of IDs that are required for basic public services and private services. Paper-based, internally developed, and proprietary systems have shortcomings that impact DPI such as time delays, data errors, security issues, lack of interoperability, and proprietary lock-in, the release notes.

OpenCRVS can integrate into proprietary and open-source systems. It can integrate with digital ID mana

		The introduction of Entry-Exit Systems (EES) relying on biometric data collection on the United States and European Union borders will have wide-reaching effects on international travelers.

A new <a href="https://www.border-security-report.com/webinar-entry-exit-system-ees-and-their-implications-for-international-travel/">webinar </a>organized by the Border Security Report examined the implications of the new Entry-Exit System in these two regions, their similarities, and the lessons learned during their rollout.

The U.S. has been trying to tackle the biometric exit mandate for years, struggling with challenges such as a lack of infrastructure, funding, resources, and sometimes stakeholder support, expl

		Anyone expecting to hear how biometrics can be used to recoup the hundreds of billions of dollars defrauded from U.S. government Covid assistance programs felt foolish after a Congressional hearing on theft this week.

Rather, the government has to make it easy and financially attractive for people who know of fraud to become whistleblowers. All the information at Washington's disposal cannot even narrow to the nearest hundred billion how much aid was stolen.

Identity verification would be the rearmost of rear-guard actions, and that came through in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bkUmEex4Qg">testimony</a> before the House Committee on Small Business. Committee members were considering innovative ways to win back pandemic loans and aid made based on fraudulent applic

		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/id-rd">ID R&amp;D</a> is claiming a top spot for the security and convenience of its printed photo and screen replay attacks in biometrics testing by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology.

The facial liveness algorithm submitted by ID R&amp;D achieved an attack presentation classification error rate (APCER) near zero for photo print and replay attacks. This is critical to secure remote onboarding processes against fraud without making the process inconven

		Pakistan's national database and registry, NADRA, is resuming issuing ID cards to transgender people using an X to designate a third gender that is neither male nor female after a four-month pause.

This came after an Islamic court ruled in May that giving trans people equal rights goes against Islam and that they cannot elect to change their gender, according to <a href="https://www.smdailyjournal.com/lifestyle/after-4-months-pakistan-resumes-issuing-id-cards-to-transgender-people-officials-say/article_951bbcb2-5f00-5b52-aaa1-500960976cc3.html">AP reporting</a>.

		The Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage Ministry of Zimbabwe has announced that a process is underway to upgrade its national population registry system (ZPRS) and link it to several vital government services, which will make it possible to apply for documents such as passports and national ID cards online. At the moment, application files for these credentials are submitted at physical offices.

The ZPRS is the main database which contains the biographical and biometric data of all Zimbabwean citizens.

According to <a href="https://www.sundaymail.co.zw/passport-id-applications-go-online">reporting</a> by The Sunday Mail, cutting-edge equipment such as servers have already been acquired for the ZPRS upgrade, while the portal for the submission of applicatio
