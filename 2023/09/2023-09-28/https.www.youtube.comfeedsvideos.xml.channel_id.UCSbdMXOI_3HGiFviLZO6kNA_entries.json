Your number one resource for the entire weeks worth of VR news! Well, Connect JUST happened and with it came a slew of announcement from Meta including the official launch of the Quest 3- Meta's newest VR headset. We also have a ton of news from Varjo to bigscreen and also a bit of a PSA until we get more information on the Immersed Visor. \n\nAnd also speaking about the Visor; I REALLY hope it pans out and does well. Its a device that I would use daily- but I have seen quite a few crashes of VR hardware companies and I feel its super necessary to point things out while we're in the pre-order phase. \n\nTrying to chill on the hype.\n\nJoin my discord community!\nhttps://discord.gg/Thrill\nhttps://www.patreon.com/Thrillseeker", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbDlQXy7m0", "date_published": "2023-09-28T21:10:24+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Thrillseeker", "album": "Thrillseeker", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/ewbDlQXy7m0/hqdefault.jpg"}]
