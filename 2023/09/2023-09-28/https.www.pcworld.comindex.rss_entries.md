<p>Holiday cheer is coming early for makers and single-board computer enthusiasts: The Raspberry Pi Foundation just announced the successor to the Raspberry Pi 4, and it looks totally badass.</p>



<p>Arriving at the end of October, the new Raspberry Pi 5 has been unveiled with just two variants named so far: a $60 4GB version, and a $80 8GB option. It&rsquo;s a departure from leading with a $35 model (currently the 1GB <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/&amp;xcust=2-3-2085982-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Raspberry Pi 4</a>), but given the long history of that entry price, it&rsquo;s not unlikely to see additional variants announced down the road.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no shortage of Windows tablets on the market. But for some reason, finding one with an AMD processor inside is difficult. There are plenty of 2-in-1 laptops with Ryzen power and AMD&rsquo;s efficient APU designs are the go-to choice for portable gaming gadgets like the Steam Deck. But aside from the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/629083/asus-flow-z13-review-an-even-more-modular-gaming-tablet.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Surface-style ROG Flow Z13,</a> I can&rsquo;t recall seeing an AMD-powered tablet on the shelf at all.

<p>Laptops may have risen in dominance, but the desktop PC space is no less vibrant for it. Things have only gotten more interesting in recent years, with the divide between mass-produced prebuilts and highly personalized DIY builds softening.

Take for example boutique vendor Maingear, known for its luxurious custom PCs&mdash;it&rsquo;s just announced a second line of gaming rigs in this vein.</p>

<p>Is it really possible to make current graphics cards from AMD&rsquo;s Radeon RX and Nvidia&rsquo;s GeForce RTX series with just one click? Yes, it&rsquo;s possible, and quite simple, as I will demonstrate in this easy-to-understand step-by-step guide.</p>



<p>The key to quickly optimizing your graphics card lies in the best possible configuration of the so-called &ldquo;Power Targets (PT)&rdquo; or &ldquo;Power Limits (PL),&rdquo; which significantly influence the maximum power consumption of the graphics processor (GPU) and the graphics memory (VRAM).</p>
