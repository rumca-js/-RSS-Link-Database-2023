Armed with little more than a gun at the beginning, players have to set out on expeditions through the witch\u2019s territories to amass power, loot, and new weaponry to take on the villain\u2019s demonic minions.\n\nThe early access release of Witchfire currently comes with two distinct levels, each with its own layout, theme, and most importantly, opportunities for epic battles against the witch familiars and their forces. Players can set out on expeditions and return to base to expand on their armory and level up before setting out once more in search of stronger foes.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeWRkKSGWt8", "date_published": "2023-09-28T21:15:01+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/eeWRkKSGWt8/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "EA SPORTS FC 24 Review - ANOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT", "description": "This is a significant year for EA Sports\u2019 annual football franchise, thanks to a complete change in branding, but EA Sports FC 24 sadly doesn\u2019t take that opportunity to make any meaningful changes or improvements to the series\u2019 formula. On the pitch, where it matters most, it\u2019s thankfully as good as it ever has been, with marginal iterations continuing to make the on-pitch gameplay a lot of fun, but everything around that is a letdown, to varying degrees. \n\nNot only does the game not make any meaningful changes, the few changes that it does make are disappointing in their execution as well. In the end, EA Sports FC 24 is a solid football sim, but one that feels like a real missed opportunity, given the context surrounding its release.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAQugaOvdwY", "date_published": "2023-09-28T16:30:06+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/dAQugaOvdwY/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Payday 3 Review - A DISAPPOINTMENT", "description": "Payday 3 is the long-awaited follow-up to the definitive co-op heist shooter. With a new engine, gameplay refinements and new features, it seemed poised to carry on the legacy of Payday 2 and elevate it to new heights.\n\nSadly, the results beg to differ. While it offers better gunplay and improved visuals, Payday 3 is a step back from its predecessor in several ways. Whether it's the matchmaking, the always-online requirements, the lackluster crewmate AI, or problematic Challenges and progression, the sequel feels incredibly lacking.\n\nWhile you can have some fun with its heists that are far from ground-breaking, Payday 3 is ultimately a foundation for the future instead of a brave new step forward for the franchise. The question is whether one wants to commit to it.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDuVdbnJZFU", "date_published": "2023-09-28T11:15:04+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/YDuVdbnJZFU/hqdefault.jpg"}]
