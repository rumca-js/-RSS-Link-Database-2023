There&#8217;s so much regulation around it \u2014 and for good reason.&#8221; Kelman recalled the conversation during a virtual panel discussion hosted by real estate startup Pacaso on Tuesday.

Founded in 2021, the startup&#8217;s main product is its Data Operations Cloud, acting as a &#8220;co-pilot&#8221; for data teams to optimize data transfers to and from their cloud warehouses. The startup said the tool is &#8220;zero-touch,&#8221; meaning it works instantly with a customer&#8217;s data. Revefi also sells an AI feature for insights, helping data teams move quickly to identify and correct &#8220;critical data issues.&#8221; The company is led by CEO Sanjay Agrawal,&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2023/seattle-startup-revefi-which-sells-ai-cloud-data-observability-tools-lands-10-5m/\">Read More</", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2023/seattle-startup-revefi-which-sells-ai-cloud-data-observability-tools-lands-10-5m/", "date_published": "2023-09-28T17:38:17+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GeekWire", "album": "GeekWire", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "title": "Microsoft is a guinea pig for climate friendly concrete as it paves the way to greener data centers", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"709\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/concrete-smoothing-quincy-datacenter-17-1260x709.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />Microsoft is building 120 new data centers this year alone, and operates more than 300 of the server hubs worldwide. The facilities require significant amounts of concrete, which is a big source of carbon emissions. Numbers vary, but one estimate pegs concrete used in construction as being responsible for 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions. While the tech juggernaut expands, it also aims to be climate negative by 2030. So the Redmond, Wash.-based company is acting as a guinea pig and testing greener alternatives to conventional concrete.

Johnson sees the Seattle region an ideal test bed and proving ground for Lumen&#8217;s offerings, including consumer and business broadband, voice, and data services. Yes, it helps that she has a home here, as a holdover from her prior role as Microsoft&#8217;s U.S. president.
