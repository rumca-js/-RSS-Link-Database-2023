There&#8217;s so much regulation around it — and for good reason.&#8221; Kelman recalled the conversation during a virtual panel discussion hosted by real estate startup Pacaso on Tuesday. In May, OpenAI began rolling out ChatGPT plugins in partnership with Redfin and Zillow Group to boost how people search for homes online.

The facilities require significant amounts of concrete, which is a big source of carbon emissions. Numbers vary, but one estimate pegs concrete used in construction as being responsible for 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions. While the tech juggernaut expands, it also aims to be climate negative by 2030. So the Redmond, Wash.-based company is acting as a guinea pig and testing greener alternatives to conventional concrete. This summer at the building site of a new data center in Eastern&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/microsoft-is-a-guinea-pig-for-climate-friendly-concrete-as-it-paves-the-way-to-greener-data-centers/">Read More</a>

Johnson sees the Seattle region an ideal test bed and proving ground for Lumen&#8217;s offerings, including consumer and business broadband, voice, and data services. Yes, it helps that she has a home here, as a holdover from her prior role as Microsoft&#8217;s U.S. president. But beyond that, she cites the region&#8217;s importance as a major U.S. tech hub,&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/lumen-ceo-kate-johnson-on-seattle-tech-ai-lessons-from-microsoft-and-cloudifying-telecom/">Read More</a>

Discourse among civic activists has led to community hubs such as Town Hall Seattle and El Centro de la Raza. We must weave that spirit into a next-generation venue focused on improving the post-pandemic city, particularly the downtown core.&#160; Seattle needs a &#8220;Urban Innovation Lab&#8221;:  аn evolved makersрасe сommons located in the downtown сore   fostering сollаborаtion, exрerimentаtion, аnԁ leаrning аmong diverse stаkeholԁers.
