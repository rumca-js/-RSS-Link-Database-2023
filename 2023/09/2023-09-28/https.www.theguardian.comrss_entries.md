Robin Olsen does not seem to strike anywhere near the same confidence into the back line as Emiliano Martínez and Leander Dendoncker and Youri Tielemans looked sluggish. Jhon Durán, who has impressed in cameos, endured a forgettable 48 minutes. The cavalry – Ollie Watkins, Boubacar Kamara and Martínez – will be back at home to Brighton on Saturday and at least a quick turnaround gives Villa a chance to shake off the pain of an unusually sloppy showing. <strong>Ben Fisher</strong></p><p><em>Aston Villa v Brighton, Saturday 12.30pm (all times BST)</em></p><p><em>Manchester United v Crystal Palace, Saturday 3pm</em>

As the European players and their wives descended the famous Spanish Steps, two of their number were conspicuously unaccompanied: Viktor Hovland and the vice-captain José María Olazábal. And so, in an arrestingly tender gesture, Olazábal and Hovland decided to couple up, posing hand-in-hand as they entered the Piazza di Spagna.

<p>Writers, critics and Guardian readers discuss the titles they have read over the last month. Join the conversation in the comments</p><p>I read Lauren Groff’s <strong>The Vaster Wilds</strong> in a single day and feel that I have now officially emerged from what had been a month-long reading slump. Groff writes wonderful prose, and fans of Gil Adamson’s 2007 novel The Outlander might draw some parallels, given this novel’s historical survivalist narrative. Yet Groff’s text has its own – bleaker – vibe that is compelling and original.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/sep/28/what-were-reading-writers-and-readers-on-the-books-they-enjoyed-in-september">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Young jockey rides Westover, the third-favourite, in the Arc on Sunday and will have plenty of support in Paris</p><p>The story of the first 16 years of Rob Hornby’s life suggests he was always likely to end up a jockey. A jump jockey, to be precise, since he was born in Southport, near the famous “Red Rum” beach, and later moved to a farm in Shropshire, where his spare time was spent pony-clubbing, hunting and show jumping. “My nan was a keen racegoer but it was all National Hunt,” he says. “So I was always watching jump racing, and never really the Flat. I thought it was a bit boring.”</p><p>Fast-forward to 2023 and his immediate future in Flat racing could scarcely be more compelling. Hornby will be aboard Westover, the third-favourite, in the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp on Sunday, the showpiece event of the European season and the race, alongside the Derby, every jockey dreams of winning when they set out as an apprentice.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sp

Last September it had been Liz Truss’s turn to do the annual local radio round before the Tory party conference. Like most things Truss comes into contact with, it had quickly descended into a chaotic disaster. One for the ages.

Or the weather. Talking to people was just one of the things at which Truss was extraordinarily crap.</p><p>It’s not Rishi Sunak’s strong point either. He lives in his own bubble where other people only exist to be informed and entertained by his own brilliance. His is a gilded, entitled world where he can do no wrong.

<p>From the 1500m to the marathon, this year has seen seconds and even minutes shaved off race times. But what accounts for the change: supershoes, feminism or something else?</p><p>If you have a gym pass or access to a treadmill, here is an experiment to try with caution – or, safer still, restrict it to a thought experiment. Put the speed up to a whisker under 12 miles per hour – assuming, of course, that it lets you, as many home treadmills don’t dare go that fast. And then run for your life, preferably with a big pile of pillows behind for when you fly off the back.</p><p>Now imagine sustaining that pace for 26.2 miles. Because that is the speed at which the Ethiopian athlete Tigist Assefa destroyed the women’s world marathon record in Berlin, taking more than two minutes off the previous record and finishing in 2 hours 11 minutes and 53 seconds.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/sep/28/when-i-saw-her-time-i-pinched-myself-why-womens-running-records-are-b

Reclining Figure, which is around two and a half metres long, depicts a woman lying down, her face supported by her arms, brooding melancholically or perhaps just daydreaming. Her entire body is swathed in white, against patches of blue and red. The drawing insists on the privacy of her selfhood, and defies you to exploit or possess her with your eyes.</p><p>You literally cannot. She slips away from the gaze.

Most remain in their home countries, like Sudan, or in already fragile neighbouring countries such as Pakistan and Lebanon. But it is vital that all countries, including the UK, continue to take their share of responsibility for offering protection to refugees.</p><p>In the aftermath of the Holocaust, the UN refugee convention was signed to ensure that the rights and protections of refugees were established under international law. This convention continues to offer an adequate framework for supporting refugees and asylum seekers.

He doesn’t want his trophies. “I don’t want any memorabilia left by the time I’m 70 or 80,” he said. “I’m preparing for death – part of that is I don’t want no snooker stuff – waistcoats, cues, it’s all going to go.”</p><p>Preparing for death? Ronnie is in his 40s and, as far as anyone knows, in good health. But I know what he is getting at. You can’t take any of it with you. You can’t take your money or any of your stuff. For the former you will find any number of willing takers, for the latter not so much.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/sep/28/ronnie-osullivans-spin-on-preparing-for-death-is-a-lesson-for-all-

In From Russia with Love, Ian Fleming writes that in Sežana “the hard-faced Yugoslav plain-clothes men came on board”. The Simplon-Orient-Express used by James Bond hasn’t run since 1962, and the border antics on the frontier between erstwhile Yugoslavia and Italy disappeared with the accession of Slovenia to the Schengen zone in 2007. The railway station in the Slovenian town of Sežana is nowadays a sleepy outpost. The most exotic departure of the day is the early-afternoon Eurocity train that rumbles east along the main line to Ljubljana, eventually reaching Vienna in the evening. It’s a fine ride, but closer to hand is a remarkable rural railway which deserves to be far better known.

Yet when his predecessor, Edwin van der Sar, arrived at Old Trafford in 2005 he was two years older than De Gea is now and signed from a team whose closest dalliance with a trophy was losing the 1975 FA Cup final: Fulham, who Van der Sar moved to from Italy’s most storied club, Juventus, in 2001.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/28/david-de-gea-r

I was just getting to like her caustic takedowns of successive Tory prime ministers, but now the old Theresa comes back to haunt us. There’s no doubting that she is dutiful.

That’s quite a burden to bear, and it gives a piquancy to her attacks on Boris Johnson and others who believe the rules don’t apply to them. The implication is that she would have made a better prime minister than Johnson during Covid. (Not a high bar, but anyway.)</p><p>It’s also clear that she cares about stuff.

<p>The 50th anniversary extended director’s cut of the 1973 tale of teenage possession still shocks</p><p>William Friedkin’s deadly serious contemporary horror, adapted for the screen from the bestseller by novelist William Peter Blatty, is back now in cinemas for its 50-year anniversary in the extended director’s cut. This is the film that whispered its evil into the ears of US audiences traumatised by political and generational upheaval. It is also the great ancestor of the entire horror genre: a 132-minute jump scare – with horribly malign slow sections – taking place in upper-middle class America rather than some exotic central European locale. (I have in the past suggested that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/07/william-friedkin-director-exorcist-french-connection-dies">it brought supernatural fear into the American suburbs</a>; well, I should admit that Georgetown in DC is hardly a suburb, in fact the point is that it is very near the political centre of the

I was – for much of my childhood my mum was undergoing treatment for it, and shortly before I turned 10, she died from it.

Here are some of the things I know now that I wish I had known then.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/sep/28/the-secret-world-of-breast-cancer-17-surprising-things-i-wish-id-known">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A small primary in Podsadek is at the centre of a legal row about segregation and discrimination in the run-up to elections</p><p>Viera Kičrova was angry. Reluctant to talk when approached outside her office, she bristled with frustration. The questions asked of her were redirected to the mayor, the municipality, anywhere but the school she leads. But Kičrova had little to lose. She would, in the end, try to explain. “The children are not responsible for the situation,” she said. “We are here to help them no matter the colour of their skin.”</p><p>Kičrova is the headteacher of a small elementary school in the foothills of the Carpathian mountains, in eastern Slovakia, that has been at the centre of a national debate in the run-up to the east European country’s general election in late September, a judgment from the supreme court in Bratislava, and most recently an intervention from Brussels.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/28/roma-only-the-school-caught-up-

<p>When a microbe was found munching on a plastic bottle in a rubbish dump, it promised a recycling revolution. Now scientists are attempting to turbocharge those powers in a bid to solve our waste crisis. But will it work?</p><p>In 2001, a group of Japanese scientists made a startling discovery at a rubbish dump. In trenches packed with dirt and waste, they found a slimy film of bacteria that had been happily chewing through plastic bottles, toys and other bric-a-brac. As it broke down the trash, the bacteria harvested the carbon in the plastic for energy, which it used to grow, move and divide into even more plastic-hungry bacteria. Even if not in quite the hand-to-mouth-to-stomach way we normally understand it, the bacteria was eating the plastic.</p><p>The scientists were led by Kohei Oda, a professor at the Kyoto Institute of Technology. His team was looking for substances that could soften synthetic fabrics, such as polyester, which is made from the same kind of plastic used in
