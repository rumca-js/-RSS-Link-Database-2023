Witchfire puts players in the shoes of a witch hunter, known as a Preyer, as they set out to hunt down a particularly powerful witch and all of their familiars. Armed with little more than a gun at the beginning, players have to set out on expeditions through the witch’s territories to amass power, loot, and new weaponry to take on the villain’s demonic minions.

The early access release of Witchfire currently comes with two distinct levels, each with its own layout, theme, and most importantly, opportunities for epic battles against the witch familiars and their forces. Players can set out on expeditions and return to base to expand on their armory and level up before setting out once more in search of stronger foes.

This is a significant year for EA Sports’ annual football franchise, thanks to a complete change in branding, but EA Sports FC 24 sadly doesn’t take that opportunity to make any meaningful changes or improvements to the series’ formula. On the pitch, where it matters most, it’s thankfully as good as it ever has been, with marginal iterations continuing to make the on-pitch gameplay a lot of fun, but everything around that is a letdown, to varying degrees. 

Not only does the game not make any meaningful changes, the few changes that it does make are disappointing in their execution as well. In the end, EA Sports FC 24 is a solid football sim, but one that feels like a real missed opportunity, given the context surrounding its release.

## Payday 3 Review - A DISAPPOINTMENT

Payday 3 is the long-awaited follow-up to the definitive co-op heist shooter. With a new engine, gameplay refinements and new features, it seemed poised to carry on the legacy of Payday 2 and elevate it to new heights.

Sadly, the results beg to differ. While it offers better gunplay and improved visuals, Payday 3 is a step back from its predecessor in several ways. Whether it's the matchmaking, the always-online requirements, the lackluster crewmate AI, or problematic Challenges and progression, the sequel feels incredibly lacking.

While you can have some fun with its heists that are far from ground-breaking, Payday 3 is ultimately a foundation for the future instead of a brave new step forward for the franchise. The question is whether one wants to commit to it.
