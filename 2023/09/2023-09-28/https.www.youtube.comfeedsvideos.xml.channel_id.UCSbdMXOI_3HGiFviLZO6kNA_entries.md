Hello and welcome to TUESDAY NEWSDAY! Your number one resource for the entire weeks worth of VR news! Well, Connect JUST happened and with it came a slew of announcement from Meta including the official launch of the Quest 3- Meta's newest VR headset. We also have a ton of news from Varjo to bigscreen and also a bit of a PSA until we get more information on the Immersed Visor. 

And also speaking about the Visor; I REALLY hope it pans out and does well. Its a device that I would use daily- but I have seen quite a few crashes of VR hardware companies and I feel its super necessary to point things out while we're in the pre-order phase. 

Trying to chill on the hype.
