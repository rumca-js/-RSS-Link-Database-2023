<p>I've always been equal parts fascinated and terrified by bugs. These seemingly contradictory sentiments most likely stem from them being a bit contradictory themselves. They are everywhere yet feel foreign, vital to our world's operations yet seemingly insignificant, and small yet capable of improbable feats, whether that be carrying objects 50 times their weight or rendering homes inhospitable. They are disarmingly complex creatures--and it makes them the perfect subject for a game just as intricate as they are.</p><p dir="ltr">Cocoon, the debut game from Geometric Interactive, is a surreal and intimate puzzle game that is also beautifully complex. Considering the pedigree of its gameplay designer--Jeppe Carlsen of Limbo and Inside fame--perhaps this shouldn't be too surprising, but it didn't stop me from continuously being in awe of just how tight and intelligent the overall experience was. This, paired with fantastic sound design and art, both synthetic and organic--lush yet sc

From a Spider-Man sequel to the long-anticipated return of Alan Wake and the return of the world's most acrobatic plumber, October is easily the biggest month in a year that has had no shortage of high-profile releases. Alongside Sony's webhead and Remedy Entertainment's unlucky author, there's also the return of Forza Motorsport as it shifts into live-service gear, a one-two punch of Nintendo exclusives, and incredibly detailed metropolitan management in Cities: Skylines II.</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond those games, Elden Ring and Dark Souls fans will want to keep an eye on Lords of the Fallen. Developed by Hexworks, Lords of the Fallen hasn't shied away from presenting its massive new action-

## Review Roundup For Saw X

<p dir="ltr">Saw X will reveal yet another previously undisclosed chapter in Jigsaw's sinister game. It unfolds between the events of Saw I and Saw II, when John Kramer embarks on a journey to Mexico "for a risky and experimental medical procedure in hopes of a miracle cure for his cancer--only to discover the entire operation is a scam to defraud the most vulnerable." Fueled by a renewed sense of purpose, the serial killer goes back to his mission, "turning the tables on the con artists in his signature visceral way through devious, deranged, and ingenious traps." Is that covered by his copay?</p><p dir="ltr">Saw X is written by Peter Goldfinger and Josh Stolberg, and directed by Kevin Greutert (Saw VI, Saw 3D). The film's cast includes Shawnee Smith, Synn√∏ve Macody Lund, Steven Brand, Michael Beach, Renata Vaca, and Tobin Bell coming back as John Kramer.

<p dir="ltr">With the release of Saw X, the long-running horror franchise seems to be attempting to course-correct after the lackluster critical response to the spin-off film Spiral: From the Book of Saw. That movie was the first of the franchise to not feature John Kramer (Tobin Bell) or his apprentices carrying out the wicked game of mutilation and mayhem. Instead, it focused on a copycat killer. Now, though, Kramer and his most trusted ally--Amanda (Shawnee Smith)--are back, and if director Kevin Greutert and producers Mark Burg and Orek Koules have anything to say about it, it sounds like the original Jigsaw Killer won't be going anywhere.</p><p dir="ltr">"That's why we're back," Koules admitted. "These people wanted John Kramer alive."</p><p dir="ltr">He continued, "He is the heart and soul of Saw. He just is. And he makes the franchise. It'd be hard to ever do a movie without him."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-tobin-bells-return-to-saw-x-was-so-critical/110

An email sent to subscribers this week, <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2023/09/27/disney-plus-canada-password-sharing-crackdown-november-2023/">seen by MobileSyrup</a>, dug into an updated Subscriber Agreement that states there will be "restrictions on account sharing."</p><p>Disney+ users everywhere have always been forbidden, according to the written permissions agreement, from sharing their passwords--but the company did not enforce this. On November 1, however, users in Canada won't be allowed to share passwords as an official rule.</p><p>The fine print interestingly states that password-sharing is not allowed, "unless otherwise permitted by your service tier." This suggests that Disney+ might follow in the footsteps of Netflix and offer a higher-priced tier that allows for account-sharing.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-plus-password-sharing-crackdow

<p>The Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam has partnered with The Pokemon Company to bring Van Gogh-style Pokemon artwork to the iconic museum. This is happening to celebrate the museum's 50th anniversary this year, but unfortunately, apparent scalpers are negatively impacting the event right out of the gate.</p><p>The museum's Pokemon exhibit is hosting an event called "Pokemon Adventure."
