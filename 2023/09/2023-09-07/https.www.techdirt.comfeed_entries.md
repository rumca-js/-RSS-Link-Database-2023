The two big EU attempts to overly regulate the internet are starting to go into effect.

You might recall that Biden&#8217;s first nominee to the FCC, Gigi Sohn, found her nomination torn apart after an industry-funded smear campaign successfully derailed the nomination. Sohn is an extremely competent and popular reformer, but a homophobic lobbying campaign by media and telecom giants (Comcast, News Corp.) falsely framed Sohn as a radical extremist, eroding [&#8230;]

Governments are weird. Maybe &#8220;weird&#8221; isn&#8217;t the right word. The more accurate word may be &#8220;opportunistic.&#8221; When it comes to speech they don&#8217;t like, they move into this mode. If they think they can silence it, they will try to. And they&#8217;ll do this while still pretending the speech they&#8217;re trying to control is nothing [&#8230;]

A few weeks ago, we had director Alex Winter on the podcast to talk about his latest documentary, The YouTube Effect.

Do not go gentle into that mass surveillance night, as the phrase goes. The EU Commission is sure something needs to be done about the sharing of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). And it&#8217;s not wrong! Things need to be done. But these are not the things. While the spread of CSAM is definitely something [&#8230;]

Of all the things in the gaming industry that annoy me, exclusivity deals have to rank near the very top. The idea that any title, but in particular third-party titles, could be exclusive to certain platforms, such as Xbox or PlayStation, is anathema to how art and culture distribution is meant to work.
