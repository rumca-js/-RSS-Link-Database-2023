How do you manage consistency across multiple servers or nodes?\n\nThe Raft Consensus Algorithm is a distributed system protocol that\u2019s widely used (including by systems like Kubernetes, via etcd). It is equivalent in fault tolerance and consistency guarantees to Paxos, which is often seen as a more complex approach.\n\nHere\u2019s a simplification of the algorithm:\n\nOverall design: Elect a leader among the servers, which is responsible for man", "link": "https://matt-rickard.com/raft-the-distribute-systems-algorithm", "date_published": "2023-09-07T13:30:43+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Matt Rickard", "album": "Matt Rickard", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}]
