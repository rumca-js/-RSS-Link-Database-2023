<p>The third installment offers more labored humor but with better scenery and a frustratingly unexplored well of sadness</p><p>In the years following the runaway success of her 2002 indie smash My Big Fat Greek Wedding, its star and screenwriter, Nia Vardalos, spent a lot of time circling that material without quite committing to revisiting it in the cinema. She reunited with her on-screen husband John Corbett to play a new character in her directorial debut I Hate Valentine’s Day; revisited Greek culture for the unrelated romcom My Life in Ruins; and did a single season of My Big Fat Greek Life, a sitcom sequel to the original movie. Technically, the movie’s big-screen run outlasted its sitcom follow-up: the film’s last weekend in theaters, a full year after its original release, coincided with the airing of the show’s final episode.</p><p>Strange that the show made such a quick exit, because it’s the three-camera sitcom format that should fit the My Big Fat Greek Wedding sensibili

<p>Sometimes the Mercury prize merely anoints artists we already know are great – but by broadening out and awarding it to a jazz group, it feels more worthwhile</p><p>A slight sense of disbelief attended the announcement that Ezra Collective’s Where I’m Meant to Be had been awarded the 2023 Mercury prize. You could hear it in the audience’s reaction – the cheer was underpinned by a sort of delighted gasp – and you could certainly see it in the band’s: they literally collapsed in a heap on the floor by their table. Their acceptance speech began with a thank you to God: “If a jazz band winning the Mercury prize doesn’t make you believe in God, nothing will.”</p><p>You could see why. The joke about the Mercury prize’s tokenism when it comes to jazz and folk music has been running for almost as long as the prize itself. Virtually every year, a solitary artist from those fields gets nominated and invariably goes away empty-handed. It’s been mocked as a patronising pat on the head, but yo

<p>The two outsiders have vastly different grand slam experience but both face a battle to prevent a Djokovic-Alcaraz final</p><p>As the ATP tour neared the halfway point of its 2023 season, the year had been largely defined by what had not occurred. It had been clear for a long time, as they tore through the opposition, that Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz were the best players in the world. Yet the two best players had also, somehow, not faced each other in more than a year.</p><p>Things can change so quickly in tennis. In a few short months, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/17/alcarazs-full-speed-evolution-as-a-proper-rival-may-galvanise-djokovic-wimbledon" title="">this rivalry has come to define the entire men’s season</a>.

You must have spent a lot of time on that one. I’m impressed with that.” When you are dealing with Eddie Jones, you learn fairly quickly that compliments and insults are basically made of the same substance. Everything here is masks and layers, shifting floors, the performance of a performance. The words themselves are largely meaningless: sometimes they are sincere and true, sometimes not, but you’re never going to know for sure, so in a way it hardly matters. Trying to scan a Jones press conference for genuine insight is a little bit like applying a meteorological analysis to the lyrics of It’s Raining Men.</p><p>And so you start questioning yourself.

<p>Politics is far too broken these days for honesty and accountability to show up</p><p>Things we’d quite like to see. It’s been almost exactly a year since Liz Truss became prime minister. Since her departure 49 days later, she has made just two appearances in the Commons. Two more than her partner in crime, Kwasi Kwarteng, admittedly, but just two nonetheless. Both were in debates on Ukraine. For reasons best known to herself, Liz believes she has played an integral part in Ukraine’s war with Russia. Without her support, Volodymyr Zelenskiy would have surrendered long ago.</p><p>So to mark the anniversary, it would be nice if Truss could emerge from hiding and update us on what she’s been doing. Who knows, she might even be leading the offensive to retake Crimea?

<p>There is something uniquely powerful about football – a fact brought home to me when my mother died this summer</p><p>I read Marc Stears’ book, Out of the Ordinary, this summer and recognised much of what he said in my own experience.

In the last two years I have much improved that frequency, being part of the ownership structure with Andre

<p>All I wanted was some delicious homegrown produce. Now I’m the one who’s likely to end up as dinner</p><p>Back in the spring, I was given two tiny tomato plants. Unpromising as they looked, I felt I had to be a good father to them. They grew very slowly at first but, thrillingly, a scratch of a leaf yielded a tomatoey smell. I went away for a week or two and they were bigger and better and now the leaves barely needed scratching to yield that scent. Summer had come, on paper at least, so I decided it was time for these babies of mine to strike out on their own. Their safe windowsill perch was, I sensed, breeding complacency. Outside they went, together, looking lost and vulnerable planted in a big plastic bucket. They looked in at me sadly, drooping in reproach. I feared the worst. Glancing at them as I packed to go away again, I felt sure their end was nigh.</p><p>Imagine my delight when I returned to find they’d gone completely nuts.

In these last chaotic, ultra-violent episodes, Dushane and Sully are pushed to the brink – and fans get a hugely rewarding conclusion</p><p>In the words of Shakespeare’s Much Ado About Nothing, “comparisons are odorous”. Yet Netflix’s Top Boy has always been compared to HBO’s modern classic The Wire. David Simon’s drama saw Baltimore’s ecosystem of drug crime and justice depicted as a many-tentacled beast that corrupted everyone from children to police commissioners and is arguably the greatest television show of the 20th century (The Sopranos is technically a product of the 90s). Top Boy’s continual billing as the British version of The Wire has been a heavy burden to bear. Still, in its final season, it doesn’t crumble under the weight of its US counterpart. Instead, it delivers six tense, kinetic and moving episodes where our complex anti-heroes find themselves pushed to the brink.</p><p>In many senses, the outcome has always been clear from th
