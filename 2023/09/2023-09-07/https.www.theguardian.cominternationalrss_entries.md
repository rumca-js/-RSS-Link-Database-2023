They are sprawling patches of greenery, accessed by a narrow wooden walkway that interlaces throughout the property. But unlike most urban gardens, the plant beds have plastic tubes stuck to them. The tubes are connected to large baths of tilapia, carp, catfish and perch, and circulate water between the two.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/sep/07/oko-farms-brooklyn-aquaponics-fish">Continue reading...</a>

Never mind that one commentator thought <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjY3l4RjLN4">the midfielder looked more like Lex Luthor</a>.</p><p>Bradley was the fourth American ever to play in the Italian top-flight, and just the second since the end of the second world war.

Telluride gave us Emerald Fennell’s Saltburn, Andrew Haigh’s All of Us Strangers and Alexander Payne’s The Holdovers.
