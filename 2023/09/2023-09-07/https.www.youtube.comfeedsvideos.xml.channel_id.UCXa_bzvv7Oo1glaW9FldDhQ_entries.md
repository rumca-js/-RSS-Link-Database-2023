Baldur’s Gate 3 is an instant classic. It is an RPG experience so dense and so overflowing with quality that it’s hard not to be blown away by not only its stunning achievements, but also their ridiculous scale. 

This vast, sprawling adventure nails everything you could hope for in a rpg experience, boasting excellent quests, utter emphasis on player freedom and agency, and weighty choice and consequence mechanics that make the entire experience feel reactive to every single thing that you do. From its combat to its setting to its storytelling and more, Baldur’s Gate 3 touches unprecedented heights for an RPG, and the fact that it does that as consistently as it does throughout its lengthy runtime cannot be praised enough.
