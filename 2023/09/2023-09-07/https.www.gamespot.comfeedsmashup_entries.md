<p>Ahead of Payday 3's release date later in September, Starbreeze has released a content roadmap for the game's first year.</p><p>Details of the DLCs are scant, as the roadmap only shows a name and a couple images for each update. The game's Year 1 is called The Bad Apple, themed around New York City. The roadmap lists four DLCs: Syntax Error in Winter 2023, Boys In Blue in Spring 2024, The Land Of The Free in Summer 2024, and Fear And Greed in Fall 2024. The provided images don't elaborate much more than the titles, but it's clear that the DLC will add missions based around hacking into servers and combating police forces.</p><figure style="width: 3840px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4189925-payday3roadmap.jpg"><img alt="The official Payday 3 roadmap." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1690/16904437/4189925-payday3roadmap.jpg" /></a><figcaption>The official Payday 3 roadmap.</figcaption></figure><p>A variety of other updates

It will be the first game in the franchise to use the Frostbite engine and will feature an all-new Real Impact system.</p><p>The Real Impact system attempts to simulate the effects of taking blows over the course of a match. Your fighter's attributes will degrade as you take and deal hits. However, the system also includes visual upgrades.

With the aforementioned features, as well as strand-based hair, body sculpting and a new facial animation tool, EA promises the most realistic-looking UFC game yet.</p><p>Outside of the realms of grotesque splendor, several elements of the fighter have also been reworked.

<p>Lies of P launches later this month, and in the buildup to the arrival of this Souls-like action-RPG, developer Neowiz Games has revealed a closer look at the Legion Arms gameplay mechanic in these exclusive images and video on GameSpot. Legion Arms are special pieces of equipment that P can equip and use--powerful prosthetics that give him more flexibility in combat and can also be upgraded. Once equipped, Legion Arms will consume a separate bar of magical power, and when used properly, they can open up other secret areas within the world of Krat.</p><p>P starts out with his trusty Iron Fist, his default arm, but it's not long before he can start equipping himself with gear like Deus Ex Machina. This Legion Arm is essentially an overpowered piledriver that can bury explosive stakes in the ground, perfect for when you want to lure enemies into an ambush. Upgrade it, and you'll be able to hammer even more of these explosive traps into place.</p><p>Aegis is a powerful shield that ca

<p>Starfield is now out, and as players are discovering, each new planet they visit allows them to take <em>many </em>small steps for mankind and an occasional giant leap if the gravity is just low enough. So where are the vehicles in Starfield? While there aren't any plans yet to add any vehicles to Starfield, game director Todd Howard does have some advice for players looking to explore the cosmos more quickly: invest in a jetpack.</p><p>"Once you do vehicles it does change the gameplay," Howard said to Bloomberg Technology. "Once you land in your ship [and] that you're on foot, it lets us really, for the players, make it an experience where we know how fast they're seeing things. In one sense, you do have a vehicle, you obviously have your spaceship so you can go around space, but then on the surface, you do have a jetpack that you can upgrade. Planets have different levels of gravity, which makes that unique for many planets."</p><div>          </div><p>Jetpacks--or boost packs a

<p>According to former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden, non-endemic companies like Netflix or Google are one of the biggest threats to the video game business today.</p><p>Layden spoke at a keynote on stage with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/shawn-layden-issues-warning-about-non-endemics-breaking-into-games">GamesIndustry.biz</a> head Christopher Dring at the website's Investment Submit last week. Listing his top three concerns for the industry in the years ahead, he claimed that "consolidation can be an enemy of creativity," and that "rising costs in gaming are an existential threat to all of us." He then referred to non-endemic companies like Netflix, Google, Apple, and Amazon as "barbarians at the gate."</p><p>Layden sees what happened to other entertainment spaces, like music and TV, as cautionary tales. The music industry was permanently altered by iTunes, for example. Netflix aided in destroying home video rental and changed consumers' relationship to the cinema. He is h

<p>Detective Pikachu Returns shows a side of Pokemon we rarely see in the games. While the mainline entries are designed around collecting, battling, and training, Detective Pikachu Returns taps into Pokemon’s infectious charm in order to tell a lighthearted mystery story.</p><p dir="ltr">Detective Pikachu Returns is the sequel to the 2018 Nintendo 3DS game that launched a year before the film. While they do share a title, Detective Pikachu the movie offered a different take on that universe. In Detective Pikachu the game, Tim Goodman, the goodie-two-shoes protagonist, never found his missing father. With Harry Goodman still MIA, Detective Pikachu Returns is once again centered around Harry’s mysterious disappearance.</p><p dir="ltr">Similar to the original, this sequel plays like an adventure game. You’ll spend most of your time exploring sectioned areas, chatting with persons of interest, and interacting with the environment to dig up clues. It’s still fairly straightforward, but t
