The Nun II, reviewed by Tom Jorgensen

The specifics of The Nun II’s mythology-heavy plot breeze by too fast to give the movie as much weight as it could’ve had, but on a visceral level, it's both inventive with and reverent to Valak’s menace. Moving the action to a boarding school full of scared kids amps up the stakes, with no character (except Frenchie) ever feeling completely safe. Taissa Farmiga and Jonas Bloquet make Irene and Frenchie a pair worthy of the Warrens, and director Michael Chaves keeps that heart in focus even while adding to Valak’s considerable reputation.
