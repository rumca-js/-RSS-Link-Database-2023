		Just how much should a car know about its driver? As voice-enabled generative AI infiltrates the commercial auto fleet, there are questions about what to expect our cars to <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/driver-monitoring-tech-synthetic-data-deployed-to-prevent-road-accidents">do for us</a>, and what is <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/for-automakers-drivers-and-biometric-security-providers-privacy-is-the-new-safety">being taken in exchange</a>.

With industry giants like <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/qualcomm">Qualcomm</a> demoing systems that promise seamless integration between on-board voice assistants and real-time data pulled from the cloud, the car is fully transitioning from a mere transportation devi

		The National Identification Authority of Ghana (NIA) has begun a new phase of a registration campaign for the country’s national digital ID, Ghana Card.

The exercise, which went underway at the start of this week, targets eligible Ghanaians (15 years and above) who have never enrolled their biometrics for the card, according to an NIA statement, Ghanaian Times <a href="https://www.ghanaiantimes.com.gh/nia-begins-2nd-phase-registration-for-ghana-card/">reports</a>.

Officials of the NIA say the enrollment is taking place in all its 276 district offices, while the same services are also available at selected regional offices which do not operate as “premium centers.”

		The results of testing by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology show top-ranking accuracy for <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/idemia">Idemia</a> algorithms across iris, fingerprint and face biometric modalities, the company says in an announcement.

The recent update to NIST’s <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/IREX10/">IREX 10</a> benchmark shows the company’s iris biometrics algorithms deliver the most accurate match results for single-eye comparisons. The same algorithm, submitted in June, sits third on the leaderboard for two-eye accuracy as of the August 18 update.

In the NIST Minutiae Interoperability Exchange (MINEX III) test, Idemia’s fingerprint template generator algorithm submitted on July 5 sits atop the list of results, while its te

		Face biometrics have so far been supplied to Android mobile devices in the form of software that makes use of the front-facing camera, in contrast with Apple’s hardware-based 3D face scanning. That could soon change, however, with hardware image sensors emerging as possibilities for integration into smartphones and other electronic devices.
