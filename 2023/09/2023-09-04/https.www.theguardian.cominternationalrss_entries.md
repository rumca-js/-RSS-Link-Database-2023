<p>Their five jaws are arranged in a shape Aristotle described as a ‘lantern’ but should have called a ‘horrible beak’</p><p>Sea urchins are as sinister as they appear. Ten years ago, in California’s vast, wavy kelp, sea urchins started to eat and breed, and eat and breed, and over seven years destroyed most of the underwater forests. Then they settled on the floor of their wasteland, forming spiny purple carpets, clicking urchin barrens along 150km of coastline. A major marine heatwave had damaged the kelp and a “sea star wasting syndrome” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/04/dining/california-sea-urchin-kelp-coastline.html">killed</a> the urchins’ main predator, sunflower sea stars.</p><p>Could they be eaten by us or by otters? They could not. They had entered a zombie state and contained very little uni, the rich meat inside the urchin’s shell. And they are prepared to stay that way: dormant, alone – until they spot any kelp sprout that dares to breed out of the dead land a

Those now alone<br />Are going to remain so through this estranging season<br />Of reading, of writing emails as detailed as letters,<br />Of watching dry leaves grow sodden on empty pavements.<br />Rilke said this in lines that I last read in Edinburgh<br />With my most beautiful aunt in he
