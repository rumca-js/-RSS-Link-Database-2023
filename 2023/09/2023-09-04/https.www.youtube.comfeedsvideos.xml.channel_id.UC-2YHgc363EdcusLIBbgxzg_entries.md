On Christmas Eve, 1945, the small town of Fayetteville, West Virginia was stunned by a fire at the house of George Sodder, the owner of a local trucking company. Five of the Sodder children never came out. But no remains were ever found, and as various sightings of the children started coming in, along with clues that pointed fingers at local political groups, they began to suspect that the children may have been kidnapped. What exactly happened to the Sodder children is a mystery that has never been fully explained.
