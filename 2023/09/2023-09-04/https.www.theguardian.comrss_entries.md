<p><strong>Venice film festival</strong>: An adulterous affair between bored millionaire’s wife Fanny and struggling writer Alain is surely bound for disaster</p><p>One autumn day in Paris, a struggling writer named Alain buys a lottery ticket for his married lover, Fanny. The purchase is made on impulse; it’s an offhand romantic gesture and a feeble appeal to the fates. The odds are stacked against these ill-starred lovers and their adulterous affair is surely bound for disaster. But the nights are drawing in and the only moment that counts is now. Being a writer, Alain has a tendency to quote poetry. He says, “We all get frozen in ice if we don’t act before winter comes.”</p><p>Closing in on his 88th birthday, Woody Allen likewise appears to be running out of time. His creative juices have flatlined, scandal has made him a pariah, and the Venice organisers drew fierce condemnation for even including him on the programme. And yet, undeterred, he’s still rolling the dice on his musin

<p>The PM was taking no responsibility for anything – and nor was his overconfident education secretary</p><p>The metaphors keep piling up like a multiple car wreck. Or do they keep crashing down? It’s so hard to keep up. But you get the drift. Yet again, we have a government that’s out of control. That can do little else but bunker down in the cabinet room and pray for the roof not to fall in. Desperate for a break that just isn’t coming. Helpless to do anything but gradually disappear under the rubble of its own making. Policies in tatters and no sense of direction. Reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete is just the latest in a long line of shitshows.</p><p>This wasn’t the way Rishi Sunak had wanted to begin the new parliamentary session.

<p>Keir Starmer is close to embracing a consensus that has failed. Better for Labour to be open-minded about today’s problems</p><p>In 2021 the Department for Education calculated that more than 300 schools needed to be repaired every year to deal with the possible catastrophic collapse of the postwar concrete with which they had been built. Jonathan Slater, who was the department’s top civil servant from May 2016 to August 2020, <a href="https://twitter.com/BBCr4today/status/1698595798445932834" title="">told the BBC</a> that civil servants thought that the Treasury would only pay for 200 annually. But they did not count on the penny-pinching of Rishi Sunak. He would end up funding only 50 rebuilds a year. At the weekend the austerity chickens came home to roost. More than 100 schools have been shut fully or partly due to risky reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (Raac). <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/sep/04/hundreds-not-thousands-of-english-schools-at-risk-f

<p>With different planting, and by rejecting insecticides, even small green spaces can promote biodiversity</p><p>Gardeners’ attitudes to insects, like those of humans in general, are a mixed bag. Butterflies’ brief, fluttering lives make them beloved wonders. Bees have long been a source of fascination as well as honey. But the reason why some creepy-crawlies have been classified as pests while others haven’t goes beyond appearances. Horticulturalists, like farmers, generally object to insects that eat what they grow.</p><p>This hasn’t saved the creatures that don’t consume crops or garden plants. Habitat loss resulting from urbanisation and deforestation, and pesticide use in agriculture, mean that global insect populations are in steep decline. In the UK, the number of flying insects is estimated – by looking at vehicle number plates – to have <a href="https://cdn.buglife.org.uk/2022/05/Bugs-Matter-2021-National-Report.pdf" title="">fallen by 58.5%</a> between 2004 and 2021.

It was far from easy during my jail term, but conditions were far worse during the pandemic as all visits, education and exercise were cancelled.</p><p>I called round my literary friends who had too many books on their shelves, and drove a car load to Pentonville, where they were gratefully received.

Part of the problem, he says, is the sheer number of instruments involved. “We’ve got about 30, across everybody in the band,” he says. “I play hurdy-gurdy, pipes, whistles, synths. Then there is the tape machine, a tambourine and concertina. That’s seven just for me. Honestly, our soundchecks take about four hours.”</p><p>There is also the fact that Lankum like to experiment with the fabric of the acoustic instruments they play: taping tin whistles together and blowing them simultaneously, recording not the notes produced by the uilleann pipes but the groaning of their bellows, taking drum

I wear them on flights and trains, when I’m writing at home, to and from yoga and on my morning coffee run. I even drove halfway across California in them to visit a flax farm.

During the Aids crisis, it was unusual for a gay character to be alive at the end of a drama’</p><p>I wrote Beautiful Thing quickly in the summer of 1992. It came from the heart. The age of consent debate was going on – back then, gay men had to be 21 to have sex. The rhetoric used in parliament was so archaic, with words like “buggery” and “sodomy”. I wanted to write a play about two boys falling in love, and give it a happy ending. During the Aids crisis, it was unusual for a gay character to still be alive at the end of a drama. Class was important, too. Gay characters in Merchant Ivory films went punting, but if you were working class on screen, you would end up becoming a rent boy and selling your arse for 20 Woodbine cigarettes. My own experience, however, was that tolerance and acceptance were not just the privilege of the upper and middle classes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/c

<p>I have started listening to a Jungian podcast full of fascinating conversations and dream analysis. But I can hear my dad turning in his grave</p><p>My dad was a criminologist, but he self-identified as a behavioural psychologist. I only ever knew two things about behaviourism. One was a joke: two behaviourists have sex, and one turns to the other and says: “That was great for you; how was it for me?” There’s a funnier joke about a guy who has a fear of monsters under his bed, and after cycling through all the therapy in the world lands at a behaviourist who tells him to cut the legs off his bed.</p><p>You get the picture, right? Humans’ deepest motivations are all right there to see in their behaviour. Whatever you do, make it literal and solutions-based, and don’t get any metaphors involved. There’s probably a bit more to it than that, but never mind. None of us has to practise as a behaviourist in the next 20 minutes, and if and when we do, someone will train us.</p> <a href="h

<p>Cheap as chips but much healthier: a Middle-Eastern duo of french beans in tomato sauce with easy flatbreads, and a spicy fattoush salad … let the bean-counting begin …</p><p>The season for both fine and runner beans is soon coming to an end, so here are two quick and easy recipes using both. Beans in a spiced tomato sauce is common across the Mediterranean, and especially in the Middle East, where they appear in various meze combinations all around the region. The flatbread recipe that goes with them is a really useful one to have to hand, because it’s basically an instant bread without any proving, relying instead on baking powder and bicarbonate of soda as raising agents. Fattoush, meanwhile, is traditionally made with cucumber, tomatoes, herbs and toasted pitta, but why stop there? It’s a wonderful salad, lightly spiced and with a lovely crunch from the bread. Use any veg you fancy, though it’s a good idea to dress them all separately, especially cooked ones while they’re hot,

<p>As global events spin us into anxious helplessness, effective altruism offers a solution</p><p>Imagine you’re travelling through a conflict zone. During a long bus ride, there’s an explosion, and the bus flips over. When you regain consciousness, you find yourself in the midst of chaos. Your travel companion is trapped under the wheels, looking into your eyes and begging for help. A few metres away, an injured child screams in pain. At the same time, you hear the ticking of another explosive device, but you don’t know where it is, or when it’ll go off. In the distance, you hear gunshots.</p><p>Whatever you decide to do will be wrong in some major way. Save your friend? The child still screams. Take care of the child? The bomb keeps ticking. Defuse the bomb? While you consider the options, your friend dies in front of you.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/sep/04/the-big-idea-how-can-we-live-ethically-in-a-world-in-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Based on footage Fernanda Pessoa and Adriana Barbosa recorded during Covid, this film celebrates female empowerment. It falls short of the pioneers it pays tribute to, but it’s an earnest snapshot of the pandemic</p><p>A feminist homage; a visual record of female friendship; a political collage.

<p>Chelsea’s reliance on youngsters looks risky, Dominik Szoboszlai shines and Jordan Pickford finds redemption</p><p>The early stages at the Emirates suggested Manchester United would continue their recent dismal record in away matches against the leading clubs, the visitors inviting a lively Arsenal on to them. But the deluge never truly came, and the diligent defensive performances of Diogo Dalot and Aaron Wan-Bissaka in particular – the former shackling Bukayo Saka expertly – were crucial in giving United a base on which to build. That could so easily have been the narrative as Erik ten Hag’s side looked far more comfortable in their own skins in the second half. But Alejandro Garnacho’s late strike being ruled out for the most fractional of offsides proved the game’s Sliding Doors moment, after which it became all about the excellent Declan Rice’s first Arsenal goal and a late breakaway of the sort that happens to any team chasing the game. Rice was understatedly the best midfie

<p>Selecting Justin Thomas as a wildcard because of his previous exploits and popularity is a risky strategy that could backfire</p><p>Zach Johnson’s experience of team environments did not originate in golf. Until the age of 18, he was an avid footballer. A striker, he says. “I had a good left foot for a rightie. I was the set‑play guy; corner-kicks and free‑kicks.” Individual sport soon took over, Johnson’s career elevated by two major wins, but one assumes memories from the dressing room lingered.</p><p>The coming weeks will see typical, contrived nonsense spouted about the importance of Ryder Cup captains and, as is even more the case, their deputies. It is possible to be a disastrous leader of men in this context but organising 24 of the finest golfers in the world into something even remotely resembling competent order should never be overly complicated. Nonetheless, the recent rising of wildcard numbers on both the European and US sides does give captains a significant role. H

Stewart pointed out there was no “prayer card” in the brass holder at the back of the seat, meaning it was free. The unnamed Tory glowered. “Why don’t you just fuck off,” he told Stewart. Subsequently, piqued by Stewart’s election to the foreign affairs select committee, the same MP threatened to punch him on the nose.</p><p>Stewart’s memoir of his nine years in British politics is filled with similarly grim and darkly amusing episodes.

Then the catwalk called …</p><p>When Dorrit Bøilerehauge was 60, an email from a modelling agency landed in her inbox – she was being scouted for a job. “I was flattered, but I was also hesitant,” she recalls. For decades she had worked in fashion communication and as an academic specialising in fashion at Aarhus university in Denmark.<strong> </strong>“When I was in the media, or asked about anything, it was never about me, it was about my analysis, my work. Could I combine being a model with being an expert?”</p><p>Her two daughters and colleagues persuaded her to give it a go. “I loved it from the very first,” she says. Bøilerehauge also danced until she was 57, so she was comfortable performing. “It’s a dialogue between the model and the photographer. I pay attention – what would they like from me? I try to fill their creative framework. It’s a very focused spot to be in, a dialogue in

<p>Neighbours replaced fence before we moved in and said previous owner of our home was OK with it</p><p><strong>Q</strong> We moved into our home a few years ago, buying the property from an elderly woman. She was clearly in the first stages of dementia and her relatives managed the sale for her to move into a home. As we’ve come to decorate the property, it’s been clear that work she has paid for looks good from the outside but closer inspection sees corners cut and poor workmanship. We thought that was the extent of her being taken advantage of until my partner was invited into our neighbours’ garden. Here they actually have the original fence posts that are, in places, a foot or more away from the current fence dividing our gardens. They had replaced the fence (it’s their side) a year or so before we moved in. When my partner pointed it out, the owner muttered something about the elderly woman being fine with the line of the fence. We, however, are not.</p><p>This “land grab” has
