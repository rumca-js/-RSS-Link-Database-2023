In today's Daily Fix:
Bethesda's Starfield is almost here, and their attention will be focused on that game for some time. But don't think they've forgotten about their other highly-anticipated RPG, The Elder Scrolls 6. The company provided a brief update on the game, and it might be disappointing to learn we won't be seeing much of it any time soon. In other fantasy news, The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria will allow you to recreate the epic journey the Fellowship took in the first Lord of the Rings book. In fact, it'll take you about two hours of walking in real time to make it all the way through. And in Warcraft news, a guild playing the hardcore mode of World of Warcraft has suffered a betrayal of the highest degree.
