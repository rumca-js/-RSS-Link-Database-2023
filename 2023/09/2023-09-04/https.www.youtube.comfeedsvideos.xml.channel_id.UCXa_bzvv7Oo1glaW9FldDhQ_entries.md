Another year, another title in the NBA 2K series. However, even with all the microtransactions, Visual Concepts is implementing several changes while offering updates to MyPlayer, Badges, gameplay mechanics, and more.

With Kobey Bryant as the cover athlete this year, players can engage in the new Mamba Moments. You'll revisit big moments from his illustrious career, even going up against Michael Jordan in an epic confrontation. Current-gen players can look forward to a new location for The City and cross-gen play. Thankfully, previous-gen and PC players also get a new scenic location for The Neighborhood.

NBA 2K24 launches on September 8th for PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and PC. Here are 15 things you need to know before jumping in.
