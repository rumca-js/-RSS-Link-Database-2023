<p><em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</em> has risen from the depths of development hell, two years after Paradox Interactive parted ways with the game's former developer, Hardsuit Labs, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-indefinite-delay-165029556.html"><ins>delayed the game indefinitely</ins></a>.

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-xvi-review-ps5-140058789.html"><em><ins>Final Fantasy XVI</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>won't remain a PlayStation 5 exclusive much longer. Square Enix has confirmed that a PC port is officially in development. That's not too much of a shock considering that the game's first trailer in 2020 <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/final-fantasy-16-officially-announced-for-ps5-and-pc/"><ins>mentioned a PC version</ins></a>, a tidbit that Square Enix later walked back.</p><p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/finalfantasyxvi/status/1698133463323611566"><ins>video posted to X</ins></a> (formerly Twitter), producer Naoki Yoshida said his team is currently working on a PC version of the game. Yoshida also noted that Square Enix plans to expand the game. &quot;One thing that came through particularly strongly was how people wanted to see more of Valisthea's story and spend more time with her inhabitants,&quot; he said. &quot;To accommodate, the d

<p>Volkswagen's ID lineup is pretty well fleshed out by now, with vehicles ranging from the ID.2all compact to the ID.4 crossover — but where are the enthusiast vehicles? VW has <a href="https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/sporty-electric-emotive-volkswagen-presents-the-id-gti-concept-show-car-17584">answered that questio</a>n with the ID.GTI concept, an electric hot hatch that will eventually head to production.&nbsp;</p><p>Much like original GTI that inspired it (the &quot;I&quot; no longer stands for injection but &quot;intelligence&quot;), it's a sporty, compact hatch that looks fast standing still. Size-wise, it's shorter but taller than the current Golf GTI, with slightly more interior volume. The ID.GTI is based on (and strongly resembles) the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vws-id2all-compact-ev-will-cost-under-25000-when-it-arrives-in-2025-194635462.html">ID.2all compact</a>, adding features like 20-inch wheels, front, side and rear spoilers, a rear diffu

<p>My favorite video game of 2023 involves a portly, balding pizza chef named Peppino Spaghetti scaling a medieval tower to defeat a sentient floating pie threatening to blow up his pizzeria. It was developed by a small independent studio named Tour de Pizza, led by a designer named McPig. Its soundtrack was <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/2023s-best-gaming-soundtrack-was-co-created-by-a-high-school-student-and-a-first-time-composer/">largely composed</a> by a first-time composer and a high school student. Its art style is at once expressive and grotesque. It’s called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2231450/Pizza_Tower/"><em>Pizza Tower</em></a>, and it is, in all seriousness, one of the best 2D platformers I’ve played in a long time.</p><p>I’m late here, as <em>Pizza Tower </em>arrived on PC in January. Currently, it has the <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/gameratings/2023/">second-highest user rating</a> of any 2023 release on Steam. The simplest way to describe it

<p>Would you be willing to pay for Facebook? Meta may add a paid subscription option to Instagram and Facebook for users in Europe, according to <em>The New York Times.</em> The ad-free tier addresses European Union (EU) regulations that have diminished some of Meta’s most lucrative data-collection methods, but, the <em>NYT</em> says, the company would continue offering free ad-supported versions of Facebook and Instagram in the EU. So, is this a cost-saving move? Would ad-free sites affect the company’s bottom line? Back in April, Meta said that advertising in the EU made up 10 percent of the company’s total revenue.</p><p>The EU fined Meta €1.2 billion in May for moving EU citizen’s data to US-based servers. In addition, the company was fined €265 million in 2022 for failing to prevent millions of Facebook users’ mobile numbers (and other data) from being scraped and posted online.</p><p>Oh, and self-promotion time: The Morning After is heading to YouTube for a weekly show.

The four-door sedan is the first in the company's line of Mercedes-Benz Modular Architecture (MMA) EVs, which will include a shooting brake and a pair of SUVs. Though it was unveiled as a concept at Munich's IAA Mobility motor show, the CLA Class is slated to go into production as a real EV in late 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>MMA was conceived for the automaker's entry-level CLA Class vehicles as an all-new &quot;electric first&quot; design. The concept is almost exactly the same size as the company's current CLA sedan at 185 inches long and has a soft egg-like shape designed to move through the air as cleanly as possible (the hood is longer than other EVs, as Mercedes may offer it wi
