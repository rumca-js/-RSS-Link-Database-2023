Today, Robert Downey Jr.'s career couldn't be in a better place.  After his portrayal of Tony Stark in Iron Man led to the beginning of the most successful movie franchise in history, it seemed RDJ could do no wrong.  But in the years before Iron Man hit theaters, Robert Downey Jr. was seen as a major liability and unemployable by most movie studios.  But one lucky turn in this Shane Black movie changed everything for Robert Downey Jr., and led to his massive career turnaround starting with Marvel's Iron Man.
