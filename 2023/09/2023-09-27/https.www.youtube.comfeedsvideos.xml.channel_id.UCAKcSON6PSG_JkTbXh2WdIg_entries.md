Los Angeles-based folk-punk musician Sunny War — born Sydney Lyndella Ward — is known for her virtuosic guitar playing accompanied by deeply honest lyrics reflecting 21st century concerns. From playing in smaller Americana scenes to being on multiple late-night shows in the past year, Ward’s journey in music has been nothing less than fruitful.

Her latest album, "Anarchist Gospel," explores resiliency and deep reflection, as it’s wrapped up in a bow of lush harmonic music with strong roots in Americana and folk. 

Sunny War stopped by The Current studio to share some songs from her newest album — including this performance of "New Day."

You can watch the full session here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Co9oewV1O4&amp;t=1s 

Sunny War’s 2023 album, Anarchist Gospel, is available on @NewWestRecords.
