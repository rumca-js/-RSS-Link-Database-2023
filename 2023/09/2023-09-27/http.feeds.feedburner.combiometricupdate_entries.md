Imperial Tobacco Canada (<a href="https://www.imperialtobaccocanada.com/">ITCAN</a>), which produces most of Canada’s major cigarette brands as well as the VUSE brand of vapes, has announced the expansion of a pilot for a biometric pass to access its VUSE retail stores.

In a release, the South Korean biometrics firm announced that the Realscan S60 and the BioMini Slim 2 scanners attained the level 2 standard in ISO/IEC 30107-3 Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) as assessed by BixeLab.

Both scanners achieved a 100 percent success rate in detecting sophisticated simulated<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202303/biometric-anti-spoofing-handbook-updated-with-liveness-competitions-legislative-impact"> spoofing</a> attacks, including biometric spoofs made with a variety of materials, from clay to gelatin.

		Sensor maker Next Biometrics says it has raised gross proceeds of NOK 60 million in a private placement – debt financing – intended to enliven its operations and prepare for expected new orders.

The <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/next-biometrics-group-asa">Sweden firm</a> makes large-format, slim fingerprint sensors.

		A team of Sony and Tokyo University researchers say they have created a better way to measure apparent skin color in computer vision, a task at the heart of worries that facial recognition algorithms might never grow beyond harmful biases.

In their pre-print paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.05148.pdf">posted</a> on Cornell University's arXiv server, the scientists say their proposal is a "simple, yet effective, first step towards a multidimensional skin color score."

They have added a skin hue axis – from red to yellow --  to simple skin tone for measuring. The result, they say, is a multidimensional color scale in an x-y chart combining tone and hue for assessing fairness in algorithms.

Conventionally, industry and government use Fitzpatrick skin classification

		Mali’s military junta announced on Monday it would postpone elections scheduled for February due to technical reasons, including a dispute with biometric technology maker <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/idemia">Idemia</a>.

The junta has accused the French company of holding the country’s civil identification database “hostage” since March due to unpaid bills. The issue has made it impossible to register new voters and update the voting registry, the military government says.

Idemia confirmed to Reuters that the service has been shut down because of outstanding invoices, adding that the company has no contact with the junta. The company was hired by the former Malian government to create the civil identification system known as RAVEC.

		Indian Railways is planning to install thousands of CCTV cameras equipped with facial recognition across greater Mumbai in an effort to boost security.

The project is worth 890 million rupees (US$10.6 million) and is partially bankrolled by the Nirbhaya Fund, dedicated to enhancing women’s safety in the country.

A total of 6,122 cameras will be deployed to 364 railway stations operated by the Central Railway, a part of Indian Railways. Of them, around 3,652 will feature facial recognition technology and will be strategically placed across 117 vital railway stations, Central Railways spokesperson Shivraj Manaspure <a href="https://www.freepressjournal.in/mumbai/mumbai-cr-to-install-cctv-cameras-with-face-recognition-technology-across-364-stations">told</a> Fr

		For whatever reason, state collection of DNA – a biometric identifier – does not stir the U.S. public, at least, the way facial recognition algorithms tend to do. Yet the numbers involved in programs like these are only rising into the tens of millions.

Mother Jones, the icon of advocacy journalism in the United States, has published what it found in looking at a biometric-harvesting program born under liberal Pres. Barak Obama and expanded under his more-authoritarian successor.

The program in question was <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/CFR-2021-title28-vol1/CFR-2021-title28-vol1-sec28-12">legislated</a> by Congress in 2009 and aimed squarely at immigrants and immigration aspirants with some executive flexibility on enforcement.

In their recently released <a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2023/09/DINZ-Manifesto-2023.pdf">manifesto</a>, the organization highlights the significance of digital identities in enabling New Zealanders to safely and confidently participate in the increasingly digital economy.
