Here, that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re going to do.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dUE5WvsueA", "date_published": "2023-09-27T18:00:00+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/0dUE5WvsueA/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "What The Hell Is Going On With Mortal Kombat 1?", "description": "NetherRealm Studios' Mortal Kombat 1 has been out for almost two weeks on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC and Switch, receiving generally positive reviews from critics and fans. Sure, the Switch port is hot garbage, but as a whole, it's another resounding success for the franchise. Right?\n\nAs it turns out, things aren't so cut and dry. Several key features from previous instalments are missing, and a major new issue has been discovered, effectively negating any level playing field, similar to the Player 1 advantage that affected Mortal Kombat 9. There's also an extensive number of bugs and issues.\n\nAll of this points to one inescapable fact: Mortal Kombat 1 is a good game, but desperately needed more time for polish before releasing.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee5gjizyt5Q", "date_published": "2023-09-27T10:45:00+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/Ee5gjizyt5Q/hqdefault.jpg"}]
