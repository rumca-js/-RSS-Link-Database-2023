<p>Google has given an already-known security vulnerability a new CVE ID with the highest severity level. The reason for this is that the vulnerability, originally classified as a Chrome bug, affects significantly more applications, because it&rsquo;s a WebP vulnerability instead. </p>



<p>The WebP image file format is particularly popular on the web because it offers a good balance between storage size and quality. But the vulnerability allows attackers to use a specially crafted WebP image to create a heap buffer overflow and execute malicious code. To do this, the image must be opened in an application; in browsers, simply calling up a website is sufficient. The code executed in the background can then install malware, for example. </p>

That &ldquo;iGPU&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t go away if your laptop also includes a discrete graphics card from AMD or Nvidia &mdash; in fact, you can use it instead of the more powerful card to save a bit of battery, in a setup called a &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo; laptop. Microsoft has a bit of technology helps to smooth out the wrinkles of this double-GPU setup, effectively giving you more power <em>and </em>more efficiency. </p>

<p>Microsoft releases a new version of its two operating systems Windows 10 and 11 every autumn. However, the software company has only delivered new features for Windows 11, limiting Windows 10 to basic upgrades alone.</p>



<p>Windows 10 also received an update a short time later, but you won&rsquo;t find any real innovations. It&rsquo;s limited to &ldquo;improvements that affect the quality, productivity, and security of Windows 10,&rdquo; per Microsoft. </p>



<p>That&rsquo;s disappointing for Windows 10 users &mdash; but you&rsquo;re not fully left behind. Here&rsquo;s how you can implement the new Windows 11 features into Windows 10 as well.</p>
