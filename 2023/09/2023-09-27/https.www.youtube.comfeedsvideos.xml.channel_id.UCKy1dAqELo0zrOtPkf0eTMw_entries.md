Wargroove 2 reviewed by Malindy Hetfeld on PC. Also available on Nintendo Switch. Narration by Daemon Hatfield.
Wargroove 2 is a lot bigger, even if its tactical combat isn’t much better to match – but with how good the original Wargroove was already, that’s forgivable. The story of its three campaigns isn’t as cohesive as its predecessor and there aren’t many truly new gameplay features in the campaign levels themselves, but its Advance Wars-style tactical combat once again manages to make the hours fly by.A satisfyingly challenging new roguelike mode also provides a new way to play that could have practically been a whole game of its own. It’s a familiar package even with that mode, but if you loved the original then Wargroove 2 provides a whole lot more of what made it so great.

Coming to us from Capcom and the genius that is Adi Shankar, Netflix delivered us our first look at the upcoming Devil May Cry anime series. Adi Shankar teased a connected universe between Castlevania and Devil May Cry back in 2019, and it looks like he’s making good on that tease with a potential Bootleg Multiverse. Adi’s no stranger to successfully translating a video game to anime, as we’ve seen him do with Netflix’s Castlevania anime series. We also have Castlevania: Nocturne coming to us from Shankar. #DevilMayCry is just one of many video game adaptations we’ll be seeing coming to #Netflix. Adi Shankar is also working with Ubisoft on adapting its Far Cry 3 DLC, Blood Dragon, into an animated series. Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix will release on October 19th, and the latest trailer gives us a full glimpse at what fans can expect from the cyberpunk futuristic series. And in even more video game animation news, here’s our first look at Netflix’s upcoming adaptation of th

In today's Daily Fix:
Typically Soulsborne players want their games to be hard. Like, HARD. But the latest Souls-like, Lies of P, is getting some nerfs that seem to be welcomed by fans. Update 1.2 brings changes to some of the boss fights and making some of the field monsters just a little bit easier to kill, among other changes. The update is coming to PC first, with presumably a console date sometime in the future. In other news, Horizon Forbidden West is getting a Complete Edition that comes with The Burning Shores DLC and a slew of in-game items. This is heading to PlayStation 5 first, with PC to follow next year. And finally, Alan Wake 2 is getting a performance mode for PS5 and Xbox Series X, but (maybe unsurprisingly) not for the Series S version. Remedy did state, however, that the game was developed with 30fps in mind.

Well, apparently you can do just that in Cyberpunk 2077’s new Phantom Liberty DLC. In this video, we'll show you exactly how to do it, and what it looks like!

Ahsoka Ep 7 is largely a piece-moving affair, getting several of its main characters to places that viewers could have guessed they were going – but those pieces sure move excitingly, with fleet pacing and some good old-fashioned Star Wars fights and engaging performers from the main cast.

When Star Trek was cancelled in 1969, it was a dark time not just for fans, but for creator Gene Roddenberry himself. Unable to get another TV series off the ground, Roddenberry was reduced to selling Trek merch and doing the lecture circuit in order to support himself. Meanwhile, William Shatner was living in a camper home and taking any gig he could to get by.

But along the way, something amazing happened: The crew of the USS Enterprise refused to stay cancelled and Star Trek: The Animated Series was born.

That was 50 years ago, and today we take the long life and, well, prospering of Star Trek for granted, but back in the early ’70s that was far from the case. And while a variety of factors would combine to eventually beam Captain Kirk and company back onto our screens, it was the low-budget Animated Series that helped to save the franchise, while also reminding fans of what Star Trek was all about.
Not only did Star Trek: TAS help to save the franchise, allowing for the Star Tr

EA Sports FC 24 reviewed on PlayStation 4 by Andrew McMahon. Narrated by Ryan McCaffrey. Also available on Xbox Series X/S and PC.
If you were hoping for a dramatic reinvention of EA’s soccer sim to go along with ditching the FIFA name, EA Sports FC 24 is not that. If you’ve played FIFA, you know exactly what kind of incremental improvements and longstanding problems with AI to expect this year. New mechanics like Evolutions show that EA has a general grasp of how to improve its RPG elements, even if it’s only currently for Ultimate Team where you have to put up with all of the dreaded microtransactions. Elsewhere, Volta mode is still a lot of fun with a full team of friends thanks in part to its unique arenas, while the Career Modes once again suffer from the same lack of care they’ve been missing for years, with the added annoyance of some ill-conceived RNG-based objectives this time. All told, it might have a new name, but EA Sports FC 24 is just about the same, frustrating but be
