And it’s run by a woman … called Janet! She’s from <em>Yorkshire</em>!” The prowling stops. The head turns. A smile spreads across the formerly furious face and the cigar is ground out in an ashtray made from a replica of Michael Grade’s skull. “It’s The Yorkshire Vet in Paris!” “It’s Our Yorkshire Farm in high heels!” “It’s All Creatures Great and Small with” – the voice drops to a whisper – “boobs”.</p><p>How the faces of the producti

<p>If Pep Guardiola did not particularly relish receiving a reminder that, sometimes, possession can be overrated, Eddie Howe saw his Newcastle team transformed by the half-time introduction of Bruno Guimarães and Anthony Gordon. That pair made a mockery of Manchester City’s earlier domination, paving the way for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2023/sep/27/newcastle-united-v-manchester-city-carabao-cup-live">Alexander Isak’s second-half winner</a> to propel Howe’s side into the fourth round.

<p>Another moment of brilliance from Dominik Szoboszlai sealed yet another comeback from Liverpool as Leicester’s hopes of an upset were shattered spectacularly at Anfield.</p><p>The Hungary captain had been on the pitch for five minutes when he polished a dominant home display with a thunderous drive that kissed the underside of Jakub Stolarczyk’s crossbar en route to goal. The Championship club had taken an early lead through Kasey McAteer but stylish strikes from Cody Gakpo, Szoboszlai and Diogo Jota ensured Liverpool came from behind to win for the fifth time in eight matches. It was their fourth successive 3-1 win and the sixth time this season that Jürgen Klopp’s team have scored three in a game. Even when trailing at half-time, Liverpool’s passage to the fourth round was rarely in doubt.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/27/liverpool-leicester-carabao-cup-third-round-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This visually exquisite, tender film about a boy growing up in a military air base on an former colony is a wonderful watch</p><p>Film-maker Robin Campillo has surrendered to the flow of memory and given us this wonderful, personal movie, created with tenderness, unsentimental artistry and visual flair, inspired by his own childhood growing up on a French army base in recently independent Madagascar in the early 1970s. It is the story of an imaginative little kid spying and eavesdropping on the private lives of grownups, which are a mystery to him and a mystery to the grownups, too. Red Island elides his own poignant growing pains with Madagascar’s emergence from the infantilised colonial state. It feels like a classic depiction of childhood on film.</p><p>Twelve years after its establishment as an independent republic in 1960, Madagascar still permits the presence of the French army to assist the national authorities.

So why didn’t he?, 21 September</a>) asks if there is anyone who can honestly say that Rupert Murdoch improved the world around us. In fact, he made three vital contributions. First, by rescuing the Times newspapers he preserved media plurality. Second, by defeating the print unions, he enabled newspapers, including those on the left, to cut their overheads, giving them a better chance of surviving the transition to online. Finally, he widely expanded choice in television with Sky, which brought with it a respected news channel.</p><p>Far from creating a society where the powerful can “dictate the

The walk into town from my mother-in-law’s house takes me across what I believe to be Britain’s worst traffic lights for pedestrians.

Like nowhere else I’ve ever seen.”</p><p>Una lived in Manchester’s Hulme Crescents in the late 80s and early 90s. Constructed in 1972, the vast brutalist estate was the largest public housing development in Europe and could house up to 13,000 people. Intended as a futuristic blueprint for social housing, design and safety flaws became apparent within two years. In 1974, a child died falling from one of the easily climbable balconies. Cockroaches were plentiful, the heating system unaffordable, and residents were soon petitioning to be re-housed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/sep/27/it-was-like-blade-runner-meets-berlin-rave-the-manchester-sink-estate-with-the-uks-wildest-nig

Austria Salzburg fans’ pre-match tifo showed Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the city’s most famous son, decked out in violet and white, bringing his instrument crashing down on the head of a bloated red bull.

<p>Celebrities from Ingmar Bergman to Scarlett Johansson have what’s known as ornithophobia. Where did it begin?</p><p>“Birds are so foreign to us – there’s not one body part that looks like ours,” Olivia Rodrigo recently told Rolling Stone magazine with a straight face. The gen Z pop sensation went on: “Everyone’s all afraid about aliens and shit. They’re like, ‘What are the aliens going to look like?’ I’m like, ‘We have birds on our planet, and we’re not scared of them. We’re fine!’”</p><p>Rodrigo is not the only celebrity whose relationship with the avian community is strained.

On a stage dominated by a huge screen and cluttered with ropes and a dirty mattress, Stephanie Mohr’s production draws an immediate parallel between the confined woman with “a slight hysterical tendency” and the mysterious female figure she discerns in the pattern on the walls of her room. Aurélia Thierrée narrates while dancer Fukiko Takase, performing in this theatre’s studio, appears via video feed on the screen.</p><p>It is a clever concept, with Thierrée and Takase almost alternating the two roles.

<p>The company is calling it a ‘de facto’ ban – and it could reshape the housing market in residents’ favour</p><p>New York City’s crackdown on Airbnb, which was enforced <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/sep/06/airbnb-new-rental-regulation-nyc-housing">earlier this month</a>, has been described as a “de facto ban” by the company. The tough restrictions, designed to bring back thousands of rental properties to the housing market for city residents to live in, will be closely scrutinised by politicians in cities worldwide. Many argue that Airbnb’s exponential growth – it is now valued at close to $100bn – is a key factor behind the soaring inflation in property prices and rents that is fuelling a global housing crisis. They will be hoping that interventions like New York’s will show them a way to take back cities across mainland Europe and the UK for people who actually live in them.</p><p>With more than <a href="https://businesschronicler.com/swot/airbnb-swot-analysis

<p><strong>Dulwich Picture Gallery, London</strong> <br />From nuns to nobles, the Flemish artist loved painting unclothed women. But, as this staggering exhibition reveals, there’s so much more to him than frolicking nudes</p><p>Maria Serra Pallavicino is a queen. Technically she’s a Marchesa. But no one could look more monarchical here, in the painting by Peter Paul Rubens. She looks down imperiously from the throne where she sits swathed in silver, with an impossibly huge ruff collar of floating filigree lace tinged with gold. But it’s her intense face and dark eyes that hold you. Amid her finery, she’s engaging and mysterious, her personality more precious than her pearls.</p><p>Rubens is a painter’s painter. No great artist communicates the sheer fun of holding a paintbrush like he does. He’s an ebullient chef, laying on thick sauces of glinting, creamy colour. And women were his favourite ingredients. He lavished his attentions on them clothed and naked, at prayer and in bed. T

<p>Unite says extra £750 secured for Tower Hamlets striking workers after rubbish left on streets for nearly two weeks</p><p>A strike by refuse workers in the east London borough of Tower Hamlets, which resulted in huge piles of rubbish being left on the streets for almost two weeks, has come to an end after a pay deal with the council was reached.</p><p>Unite, the union representing the refuse workers, announced on Tuesday that a pay deal with Tower Hamlets council had been reached. Earlier this month, more than 200 refuse and street cleaners working for the council had rejected an offer of a flat rate increase of £1,925. The union said this would amount to a real-terms pay cut due to the rising cost of living. Strike action began on 18 September.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/sep/27/london-refuse-workers-tower-hamlets-strike-ends-pay-deal-with-council-reached">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A new book draws together writing from David Foot’s 50 years on the county circuit, with a 1985 day in Taunton the highlight</p><p>In the 50 years in which David Foot reported on county cricket, there were perhaps three innings that captured the public imagination more than any other: a blistering 322 scored in only four and a quarter hours by Viv Richards at Taunton, an epic 405 by the young Graeme Hick, also at Taunton, and a world-record 501 by Brian Lara at Edgbaston. It was David’s happy fate to watch every ball of all three.</p><p>As a boy, growing up in rural poverty in Somerset, David had dreamed of becoming a cricket writer. “Will I ever become a real, a REAL journalist? Will I have the opportunity of writing ‘specials’, getting to the heart of human nature?” he asked himself in a teenage diary, written while serving a drudge-filled apprenticeship on the deeply conservative Western Gazette in Yeovil.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/sep/27/richards-hick

Tommy left his old station in Philadelphia under suspicion of having covered up for a corrupt partner; he is a guy respected in the ranks for his honesty, but also for his code of omerta loyalty to his fellow officers. Tommy is married to Judy (a nice performance from Alicia Silverstone) who is a supportive and worldly cop wife, whose relatives in this close-knit community helped Tommy get the job.

Holly Cook, head of product at the Economist, described readers having a much richer relationship with the content when they became listeners, more intimate and proprietorial. It reminded me of publishing, in the old days, when there were low barriers to entry, a thousand flowers could bloom and not everyone in the business was in an unengaging steeplechase for the next Hogwarts.</p><p>But

John Keats once looked into the “wide expanse” of George Chapman’s 1611 translation of the Iliad and breathed “its pure serene”. Alexander Pope’s rhyming version of the Iliad (1715-1720) brought a canonical ancient author to a much larger audience than ever before, its readers now including literate workers and women who had never had the opportunity to learn Greek. It had been through 27 editions by 1790. The early 20th-century Labour MP Will Crooks, who grew up in poverty and was dazzled by a twopenny second-hand copy, later recalled that “pictures of romance and beauty I had never dreamed of suddenly opened up before my eyes. I was transported from the East End to an enchanted land.”</p><p>New translations also proliferated. There were nearly 50 English-language versions in the 19th century, at lea

<p>Study reveals rise in global temperatures was driven by methane emissions associated with ocean’s birth</p><p>About 55 million years ago, the remnants of the supercontinent, Pangea, ripped apart. North America went one way; Europe the other, and the North Atlantic Ocean flooded in to fill the gap. Global temperatures rose by more than 5C and many species went extinct. Quite why the world warmed so quickly has long been a puzzle, but a new study reveals that the rapid warming was driven by methane emissions associated with the ocean birth.</p><p>Scientists onboard an ocean drilling expedition collected rock samples from ancient volcanic vents that were active during the birth of the North Atlantic Ocean.
