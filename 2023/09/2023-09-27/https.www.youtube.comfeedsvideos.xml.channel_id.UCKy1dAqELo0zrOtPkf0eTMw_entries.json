The story of its three campaigns isn\u2019t as cohesive as its predecessor and there aren\u2019t many truly new gameplay features in the campaign levels themselves, but its Advance Wars-style tactical combat once again manages to make the hours fly by.A satisfyingly challenging new roguelike mode also provides a new way to play that could have practically been a whole game of its own. It\u2019s a familiar package even with that mode, but if you loved the original then Wargroove 2 provides a whole lot more of what made it so great.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uy1ssprVYN4", "date_published": "2023-09-27T23:23:21+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Ign - YouTube", "album": "Ign - YouTube", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/uy1ssprVYN4/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "How Netflix's Devil May Cry Series Might Connect to Castlevania - IGN The Fix: Entertainment", "description": "Coming to us from Capcom and the genius that is Adi Shankar, Netflix delivered us our first look at the upcoming Devil May Cry anime series.
