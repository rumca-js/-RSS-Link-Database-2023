<p>Epic Games has asked the US Supreme Court to review a ruling from 2021 that cleared Apple of violating antitrust laws, according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-27/apple-app-store-ruling-challenged-at-supreme-court-by-epic-games#xj4y7vzkg"><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>report.

<p>Ironically, when ChatGPT debuted last November and basically broke the internet for a few days, the AI itself wasn't informed. In fact, its entire knowledge base stopped abruptly in September, 2021 because that was the most recent data the system was initially trained on. Wednesday, OpenAI announced that ChatGPT will now be able to answer even the most modern of queries as the generative AI assistant can now look up information, in real-time.</p>

It uses Valve’s in-house Source 2 engine, leading to sharper textures, more believable lighting and new geometry.</p>
<p>Valve said it broke down maps into three categories. First, “Touchstone” maps are classic scenes “with solid foundations” left mostly untouched so players can check out fundamental gameplay changes from <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em> to <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>. Next, “Upgrade” maps focus on Source 2 lighting for more realistic

<p>As of November 1, Disney+ will restrict its Canadian users from sharing their accounts with people outside their households unless they’re willing to pay more. The company sent out an email to subscribers notifying them of the change, which Disney CEO Bob Iger <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-is-raising-prices-and-cracking-down-on-account-sharing-001637934.html"><ins>foreshadowed in an earnings call back in August</ins></a>.

<p>A tool called &quot;restyle&quot; is a bit like a supercharged generative AI filter.

<p>The issue with the original <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ray-ban-stories-hands-on-160048150.html">Ray-Ban Stories</a> was their somewhat clunky design and underwhelming specs. Photos topped out at five megapixels while videos were capped at a weird 1,184 x 1,184 resolution and just 30 fps. And to hold all your content, the glasses had just 4GB of onboard storage.</p>

<p>The Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 is the more powerful of the two boasting 2.5 times better GPU performance compared to the last generation and up to eight times faster AI speeds. It's optimized to support mixed reality devices with display resolutions of up to 3,000 x 3,000 per eye while also delivering more detailed textures and higher frame rates.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For headsets that can switch between VR and AR, Qualcomm says the XR2 Gen 2 allows headsets to transition to full-color passthrough vision in less than 12ms. Other capabilities include support for devices with up to 10 cameras, improved wireless speeds (up to Wi-Fi 7) and 50 percent increased GPU power efficiency.</p>

<p>Live Voicemail is an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-17-preview-public-beta-facetime-standby-iphone-120025938.html">iOS 17 feature</a> that lets you read a transcription of a caller’s message in real time. If what they say sounds urgent, you can pick up the call and chat while they’re still on the line; if not, read along with the message without playing it back (handy for especially long-winded pals). Here’s how to activate and use Live Voicemail to save time on calls and messaging.</p>
<p>First, you’ll want to make sure the feature is turned on. Navigate to <strong>Settings &gt; Phone &gt; Live Voicemail</strong>, and toggle it on if it isn’t already. (It’s on by default).</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Once it’s activated, the feature is pretty self-explanatory to use. If you receive a call you can’t or don’t want to pick up, hit the voicemail button on the incoming call screen to send it there. Or you can wait for it to forward automatically.</p>

<p>The day is finally here: There's a self-driving car available for purchase in the US. Or, at least, there will be within the next few months. Mercedes-Benz is bringing its Drive Pilot-equipped cars to California and Nevada, and, when they're deployed, you'll not only be able to take your hands off the wheel but also take your eyes off the road.</p><p>Drive Pilot is the first proper SAE Level 3 autonomy system on the road, meaning when the car is driving itself you, the driver, aren't even liable for the car's behavior. That's an impressive feat, but it's one that comes with a lot of caveats. The biggest is that it only works at up to 40 mph, and even then only in clear weather conditions. You have to be on a highway that has been mapped by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/heremaps/"><ins>Here's HD maps</ins></a>, and you must have a car ahead of you.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are restrictions within the car, too.

<p><em>Editorial Note: Apologies for the delay in this review, earlier this year I was in a bike accident – not with this bike, I should add – that left me with a months-long concussion.</em></p><p>I am a proud townie. I don’t mind the odd nature walk, but I’m far happier striding for hours at a time through cities, coffee in hand. I loved walking from law school in the center of London back to my apartment, six miles away, through the hustle and bustle. That’s possibly why I feel such a kinship with Honbike’s Uni4. It’s an elegant, efficient and beautifully-designed city e-bike of the future that is a joy to ride, just so long as you never think about taking it out of its comfort zone.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><strong>Hardware</strong></p><figure><img alt="Image of the Honbike Uni4 in Norwich City Centre" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-09/3985e2a0-588e-11ee-b575-5fa6f548e106" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption

<p>Even if you’ve never heard of Shure’s SM7B, you’ve almost certainly <em>heard </em>the SM7B. From live radio to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/advanced-podcast-buyers-guide-part-1-143053492.html">podcasting and streaming</a>, the sleek, black microphone can be found hanging in front of mouths, delivering its trademark broadcast sound. Today, Shure is unveiling the latest edition — the SM7dB — to celebrate the microphone’s 50th anniversary. It also happens to solve one of the mic’s biggest pain points (the clue is in its name). The $499 Shure SM7dB comes with a built-in preamp that adds either 18- or 28dB of much-needed gain.&nbsp;</p><p>The SM7B famously needs a lot of amplification which can lead to quiet audio or an undesirable “hiss” on inferior preamps. To solve this, people often purchase an in-line preamp such as a FetHead or a CloudLifter — which is an additional $100 or so on top of the $399 SM7B.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The SM7dB eliminates the need

<p>Meta is gearing up its annual event devoted to all things VR, AR and the metaverse. The company is once again showing off a new VR headset, the Meta Quest 3, as well as its next-generation smart glasses. We already know quite a bit about the Meta Quest 3, thanks to a preview from Zuckerberg earlier this year. The $499 headset has been considerably slimmed down and has redesigned controllers. It will also have better graphics, thanks to a new next-gen Qualcomm chipset, which will power new mixed-reality features similar to last year’s high-end Quest Pro. This is <em>the</em> consumer version of VR/AR Meta hopes the wider public will embrace.</p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-quest-3-and-ai-chatbots-what-to-expect-at-meta-connect-140049598.html"><figure><img alt="TMA" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-09/ffe8d750-5d15-11ee-bce6-adeb7fdd5cd8" style="height: 450px; width: 675px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Meta</div></figure></a><p
