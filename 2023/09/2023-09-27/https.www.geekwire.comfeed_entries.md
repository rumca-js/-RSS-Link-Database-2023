Perhaps even more importantly, the partnership includes an agreement that Honeywell will become a buyer, seller and reseller of ESS technology, with an initial target of $300 million in sales. &#8220;It&#8217;ll really help accelerate our growth into new markets, new geographies,&#8221; CEO Eric Dresselhuys told GeekWire. &#8220;We&#8217;re still a relatively small company with a relatively small team, so we get to tap into that giant global&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/honeywell-invests-27-5m-into-oregon-battery-company-ess/">Read More</a>

That&#8217;s the immediate question for anyone reading the Federal Trade Commission&#8217;s landmark antitrust lawsuit against Amazon, filed Tuesday in federal court in Seattle. The FTC complaint refers extensively to internal Amazon documents and communications in an apparent effort to contradict Amazon&#8217;s public statements and support the agency&#8217;s allegations that the company achieved and exploited monopoly power to give itself an unfair advantage in e-commerce, to the detriment of sellers and consumers. For example, the complaint says at one point, &#8220;Amazon recognizes the importance of maintaining the perception that it has lower prices than&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/ftcs-case-against-amazon-may-hinge-on-internal-messages-and-secrets-

That was a question posed by a group of Microsoft researchers in a February paper exploring different ways OpenAI&#8217;s ChatGPT could create technical instructions for robotic tasks through simple prompts. A new Seattle startup called Scaled Foundations aims to expand on that research through an AI-powered development platform that makes it easier for non-technical users to create commands for robots. Launched earlier this year, the Seattle company emerged from stealth mode Wednesday and announced an undisclosed investment from Khosla Ventures&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/chatgpt-for-robots-microsoft-vets-lead-new-startup-that-helps-create-instructions-for-machines/">Read More<

Earlier this year, the Supreme Court said it could not determine the leaker of Justice Samuel Alito&#8217;s high-profile opinion in the&#160;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#8217;s Health Organization case. Now a new Seattle-area startup wants to help prevent these types of leaks and data breaches using digital watermarking and forensics technology.
