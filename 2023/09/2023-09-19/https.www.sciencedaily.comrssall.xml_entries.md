Researchers have developed a way of detecting the early onset of deadly infectious diseases using a test so ultrasensitive that it could someday revolutionize medical approaches to epidemics. The test is an electronic sensor contained within a computer chip. It employs nanoballs -- microscopic spherical clumps made of tinier particles of genetic material -- and combines that technology with advanced electronics.

It is often hard to understand the source of pain in babies and children, and if they experience it often or for a long time, it can do severe damage.

## Tiny sea creatures reveal the ancient origins of neurons

A new study sheds new light on the origins of modern brain cells. Researchers find evidence that specialized secretory cells found in placozoans, tiny sea creatures the size of a grain of sand, have many similarities to the neuron, such as the genes required to create a partial synapse. From an evolutionary point of view, early neurons might have started as something like these cells, eventually gaining the ability to create a complete synapse, form axons and dendrites and create ion channels that generate fast electrical signals -- innovations which gave rise to the neuron in more complex animals such as jellyfish. Though the complete story of how the first neuron appeared remains to be told, the study demonstrates that the basic building blocks for our brain cells were forming in the ancestors of placozoans grazing inconspicuously in the shallow seas of Earth around 800 million years ago.

## Women given new insight into blood clot risk

New research shows an increased risk of blood clots in women who have any combination of a particular gene mutation, estrogen use, or common medical conditions -- specifically: obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and kidney disease.

## RNA for the first time recovered from an extinct species

A new study shows the isolation and sequencing of more than a century-old RNA molecules from a Tasmanian tiger specimen preserved at room temperature in a museum collection. This resulted in the reconstruction of skin and skeletal muscle transcriptomes from an extinct species for the first time. The researchers note that their findings have relevant implications for international efforts to resurrect extinct species, including both the Tasmanian tiger and the woolly mammoth, as well as for studying pandemic RNA viruses.

## 25 HPV types circulating in Nigeria: Region-specific vaccines needed

University of Delaware researchers are playing a pivotal role in the realm of global health as they investigate the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the world -- they have confirmed 25 different types of HPV prevalent in Nigeria. About half of those types of HPV cause cancer.
