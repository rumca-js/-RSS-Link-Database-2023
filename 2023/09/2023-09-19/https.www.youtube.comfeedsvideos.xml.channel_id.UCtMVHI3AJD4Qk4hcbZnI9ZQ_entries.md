Hello guys and gals, it's me Mutahar again! This time we take a look at what appears to be a situation where a F-35 fighter jet went missing after the pilot ejected, with it being on autopilot it's only a matter of time where it lands and hopefully no one ends up grabbing it for themselves. Thanks for watching!
