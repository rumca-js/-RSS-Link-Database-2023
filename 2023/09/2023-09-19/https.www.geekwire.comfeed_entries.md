The six-month program is virtual and free for seed-stage startups. The WTIA does not take any equity shares of the startup, a key difference from other accelerators. To qualify, startups need to have less than $1 million in annual revenue and at least one product in development. The program is led by a group of entrepreneurial vets and investors, including serial founder and author Dave Parker, SeaChange Fund managing member Susan Preston, and Graham &#38; Walker founder and general partner Leslie&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/wtia-reveals-33-startups-in-10th-cohort-for-founder-program/">Read More</a>

The leak appears to have been caused by a clerical error. Microsoft uploaded a number of files to a federal court website last week as exhibits in the Federal Trade Commission’s ongoing attempts to prevent Microsoft’s acquisition of California-based game developer Activision Blizzard. The upload accidentally included a number of confidential documents, as per Bloomberg, which included schedules,&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/major-leak-reveals-microsofts-xbox-plans-for-2024-and-beyond/">Read More</a>

Amazon&#8217;s Just Walk Out tech has traditionally been used in stores offering products such as food, beverages, groceries and home goods. The tech, which debuted in Amazon Go convenience stores in 2018, relies on cameras, shelf sensors, sensor fusion and computer vision to track what customers pick up.
