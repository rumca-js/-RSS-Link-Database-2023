<p dir="ltr">As the leaves begin to change and October (somehow) quickly approaches, Hulu reveals its collection of TV shows and movies set to arrive on the platform during the upcoming month. From the start of October, viewers can anticipate a lineup of titles throughout the month, including several horror movies and TV shows just in time for Halloween.</p><p>On October 5, you can get into the spirit of spooky season on Hulu by checking out The Boogeyman. Based off a Stephen King short story from 1973, the film adaptation puts the focus on a 15-year-old girl and her younger sister who are "reeling from the recent death of their mother and aren't getting much support from their father, Will, a therapist who is dealing with his own pain." Boogeyman is directed by Rob Savage (Host), and comes from a screenplay by Scott Beck and Bryan Woods (A Quiet Place) and Mark Heyman (Black Swan). Check out the trailer below.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">For something lighter--though also n

<p>Microsoft itself is responsible for leaking documents concerning future Xbox plans, unannounced games, and potential studio acquisitions. <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.413969/gov.uscourts.cand.413969.358.0_1.pdf">A new filing</a> from the FTC v Microsoft judge (via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/19/23880795/microsoft-leaked-xbox-documents-court">The Verge</a>) confirms the source of the leak.</p><p>In the filing, judge Jacqueline Scott Corley wrote that the court ordered involved parties to confer and provide the court with a "secure cloud link" with relevant documents to the case, along with redactions. Microsoft provided the link and the documents were uploaded to the case's official page. In other words, Microsoft uploaded the documents without redacting what has now leaked.</p><p>The court has since removed the documents after being informed of the leak.

<p>When you think of Mega Man, the default image that your mind conjures of Capcom's Blue Bomber is a plucky android blasting his way through hordes of robots looking to take over the world. That's a formula that remained firmly in place for years, but if you're looking for something entirely different in that franchise, then now is a great time to pick up Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection, which is now on sale for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BQ2Q7MYT?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$48 for Nintendo Switch</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Battle-Network-Legacy-Collection-PlayStation-4/dp/B0BQ2QVZ7X">$47 for PS4 at Amazon</a>.</p><p>Originally launching for the Game Boy Advance (and Nintendo DS) throughout the early 2000s, the Battle Network series is vastly different to your typical Mega Man experience.

<p dir="ltr">NetherRealm Studios had a tall order to fill with Mortal Kombat 1. As the game is positioned as the franchise's second lore restart in 12 years, the team had to find ways to make this new era of Mortal Kombat feel as fresh and new as the storyline demanded, all while maintaining the high bar of quality the fanbase has come to expect over the series' 30-year lifespan. Mortal Kombat 1 mostly accomplishes this goal through fun new mechanics and an unpredictable storyline, but the overall package lacks the depth needed to make this a masterpiece.</p><p dir="ltr">Mortal Kombat 1 picks up right where MK11 Aftermath left off, with Liu Kang ascending to godhood. As the Keeper Of Time, he is able to create a new universe as he sees fit, and his creation puts familiar faces on new and interesting paths.

<p>The big Xbox document leak has revealed many things that Microsoft never intended to be made public, and one of those is how much money Microsoft might pay a publisher to bring games to Game Pass on launch day. Game Pass getting day-one new releases is a major perk and incentive to encourage people to sign up and stay subscribers, and Microsoft might pay top dollar for this.</p><p>Xbox vice president Sarah Bond <a href="https://imgur.com/a/pHi74Dq">sent an email</a> to Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer and Xbox CFO Tim Stuart (among others) detailing what it might cost to secure major third-party games coming to Game Pass on launch day.
