<p>AlphaMissense’s predictions could help speed up research and diagnosis of rare disorders</p><p>Scientists at Google DeepMind have built an artificial intelligence program that can predict whether millions of genetic mutations are either harmless or likely to cause disease, in an effort to speed up research and the diagnosis of rare disorders.</p><p>The program makes predictions about so-called missense mutations, where a single letter is misspelt in the DNA code. Such mutations are often harmless but they can disrupt how proteins work and cause diseases from cystic fibrosis and sickle-cell anaemia to cancer and problems with brain development.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/sep/19/google-deepmind-ai-tool-assesses-dna-mutations-for-harm-potential">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>PC, Xbox, PS5<br /></strong>This hack-and-slasher clings to its Soulsborne heritage too tightly, but does creative things that no other Soulslike until now has managed to pull off</p><p>The Soulslike subgenre of games, named after the Dark Souls series of obtuse hack-and-slashers by From Software, are always punishingly difficult. It’s their whole raison d’etre – or at least that’s the accepted wisdom. Fiendish traps, deadly ambushes, terrifying bosses; what many titles in the field seem to overlook is that Fromsoft’s difficulty is almost always in service of lending an atmosphere of dread, wonder and coherence. It’s a fine line. Hear whispers of a mad fallen monarch only to beat them on your first try, and all that careful myth-making reveals itself as artifice. But if you sense the hand of an overly sadistic designer weaving in artificial difficulty, the world suddenly feels lifeless.</p><p>Enter Lies of P, a lengthy, moody action RPG that can’t always resist difficulty,

Most people experience it as a mild infection resembling a cold. But it can be very serious in babies and elderly people. The tell-tale symptoms are abnormally fast breathing, a caving-in of the chest between and under the ribs, and wheezing or crackles – worrying noises caused by the bronchial tubes being inflamed, or the small air sacs in the lungs filling with fluid. The virus makes it harder to breathe and feed, both of which are essential, but even more so for newborn babies.</p><p>The gap between public awareness of RSV and the toll it takes is massive.

<p>Director Wuershan’s ambitious adaptation of Xu Zhonglin’s 16th-century novel has too much highly variable CGI but its idiosyncrasies set it apart</p><p>“Strange things keep happening these days,” muses Jiang Ziya (Bo Huang) halfway through this extravagant adaptation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investiture_of_the_Gods">Xu Zhonglin’s 16th-century myth-and-fantasy novel Investiture of the Gods</a>. By this point, we’ve already seen a woman kill herself with a hatpin before being possessed by the spirit of a white fox; a gurgling, pistachio-coloured demon baby is found naked in the woods; and a conjuror who can make his head float free of his body when threatened with decapitation. Strange days indeed.</p><p>Ziya is one of three immortals sent to arrest the Great Curse which is threatening the future of the Shang dynasty. King Zhou (Kris Phillips) is besotted with the seductive but malevolent Su Daji (Naran), and is letting his kingdom descend into carnage. The only hop

It’s a feature of the “self-contained, temporary social ecosystem” that makes you adjust your settings. Only those people exist; since you sort them accordingly, one of them must be the most beautiful person in your world.</p><p>If you factor in the boredom of work and the huge proportion of it that is meaningless, the office 10 becomes its raison d’être, the person who can propel you out of bed on the off-chance that they might go to Pret at the same time as you, or might think similarly about Liz Truss. Be real: you are probably their office 10 as well. It’s

The result, pure and simple, or how a particular game or moment makes you feel? Different people tend to have different answers to this fundamental question, which is perfectly fine. World Cups, in particular, are about scoring more points than the other lot.

The creators and stars of the original series consider the impact of a cultural disruptor</p><p>By now, almost every aspect of modern life has been filtered through eliminative reality TV formats. The search for love. The search for gainful employment. The universal human desire to spend more time in the company of Alan Sugar.

<p>Actor embedded himself with the Ukrainian president during a time of crisis, but his film feels like a missed opportunity</p><p>Sean Penn is a brave man. He regularly shrugs off the comforts of Hollywood to parachute into sites of devastation and disaster, from Iraq and Venezuela to Haiti, where he notoriously commanded bountiful media attention over the course of a self-directed and extended embed during the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake. The actor’s new film Superpower is a documentary that goes beyond the photo ops and talk show appearances, and relays what it looks like, day after day, hour after hour, when an Oscar-winning movie star crashes a cataclysm.</p><p>Co-directed by Aaron Kaufman and produced with Vice, Penn’s Superpower was originally meant to be a feature film on Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the heroically buffoonish Ukrainian comedian whose anti-corruption bits and widespread popularity somehow translated into presidency.

<p>Tottenham’s prospects of winning a trophy remain slim but the Australian’s approach is giving supporters reason to smile</p><p>A few years ago, around the same time people started getting extremely animated by things such as net spends and expected goals, there came a school of emerging thought that challenged the traditional narrative of footballing performance, arguing – in effect – that the influence of a manager was vastly overstated. Matches are won by the best players, so the hypothesis went, and the best players cost money, and thus a club’s wage bill was a far more reliable predictor of success than whichever bloke happened to be sitting on a padded car seat in the dugout.</p><p>In this reading, the era of the all-powerful manager – the patriarchal visionary who oversaw everything from tactics to contract negotiations to the temperature of the away showers – was gone, if it ever really existed. Football’s centre of gravity had shifted away from the manager’s office towards

<p>This tale of a tower block enveloped in nothingness, and the terrible things its residents do to survive, starts grim and just gets grimmer … and grimmer</p><p>At the beginning of this remorselessly bleak apocalyptic nightmare, the residents of a tower block in Paris wake up to find the world outside has disappeared. “There is no outdoors,” marvels one man. In its place is a vast black nothingness that swallows up everything and anyone that enters it. About five minutes in, you might start thinking about the plot holes, which feel as gaping as the void’s blackness. Such as, how is that the flats still have electricity? What is making the TVs flicker like it’s the 1980s? Why hasn’t the building been sucked into the abyss?</p><p>Actually, these questions are a pleasant distraction from the film’s grim vision of how low humanity can sink. Its writer and director, the novelist and film-maker Guillaume Nicloux, clearly subscribes to a Hobbesian view that, in the event of society breaki

Then further imagine that one explanation for the delays was that the UK doesn’t have enough auditors with the right skills, and that the body that used to do most of the work was abolished in 2015. Then assume that a handful of these companies were simultaneously confessing to hundreds of millions of pounds of writedowns on property speculation.
