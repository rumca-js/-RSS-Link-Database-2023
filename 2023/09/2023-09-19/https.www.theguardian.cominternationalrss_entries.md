<p>The England hooker has gone from Ampthill in the Championship to the World Cup</p><p>Theo Dan’s rapid rise into the England ranks came thanks to a breakthrough season at Saracens – via a stint at Ampthill – but it was forged in Romanian steel. His grandfather, an engineer from Bucharest, was a keen player in his day and built a set of posts for Dan to learn his trade, locking horns with his cousins for days on end in the long summers of his youth.</p><p>The 22-year-old speaks Romanian with his parents – who moved to the UK in the late 1990s – with the odd word of English thrown in and he was due to spend another summer in Romania until a call from Steve Borthwick. The England head coach informed him he would be capping a fine season, one that began in the Championship but ended with Saracens’ victory in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/27/saracens-seal-premiership-glory-as-owen-farrell-steals-sales-thunder" title="">the Premiership final</a>, with a place in Eng

As an exponent of the dark arts Ramos was irascible, spiky and often infuriating. His career was littered with various misdemeanours, including 28 red cards, 20 of which he received in La Liga – a record for individual dismissals. However, Ramos’s return to his hometown club, Sevilla, has brought the 37-year-old acclaim. At his emotional homecoming he outlined his motivation: “It wasn’t a matter of money or a contract but a question of philosophy, mentality and feeling. At Sevilla we come together in these values.”</p><p>In light of so many high-profile players moving to Saudi Arabia in the last few months, it was refreshing to

<p>Basketball players criss-cross North America during the season. Getting a good night’s rest is vital if they want to stay on top of their games</p><p>When it came to George Gervin’s gameday routine, no one was going to mess with his soap opera viewing. Trashy shows helped the Hall of Famer relax so he could drift off into an essential pre-game nap. Without those two-to-three hours of slumber, the “Ice Man” may not have been able to lead the NBA in scoring in four different seasons. Indeed, naps, says Gervin, have been a part of NBA life for some time. Crucial in a profession that has players and coaches up at odd hours, working themselves weary.</p><p>“We’d have shootaround and then we’d come back, you eat lunch, and then I’d take a nap for a couple of hours,” Gervin tells the Guardian. “I did that most of my career.
