I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of Los Angeles 1920s, we can clearly see what is happening in broad daylight, Scene Street,

Video Restoration Process:
âœ” FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
âœ” Image resolution boosted up to HD 
âœ” Improved video sharpness and brightness 
âœ” Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
âœ”added sound only for the ambiance
âœ”restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 
âœ” added modern Noise grain for a natural result.

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
