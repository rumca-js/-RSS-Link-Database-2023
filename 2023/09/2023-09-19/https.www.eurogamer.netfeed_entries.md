Bluey, the Australian cartoon sensation (seriously, it's great and you should give it a watch even if you're not actually five years old), is being turned into a video game that's coming to Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC on 17th November this year.
</p><p>
Bluey the cartoon follows the adventures of the eponymous Blue Heeler dog, her sister Bingo, mum Chilli, and dad Bandit. All are along for the ride in Bluey: The Videogame, which promises an "interactive sandbox adventure" for up to four players, featuring fully explorable recreations of some of the show's most recognisable locations.
</p><p>
There's talk of "story-driven episodic gameplay", split into four parts, that'll include activities and mini-games inspired by the cartoon - Keepy Uppy and Magic Xylophone are mentioned - with players able to unlock new costumes, sti

Saber Interactive has announced it's ending development of last year's Evil Dead: The Game - meaning no new content will be produced and the planned Switch version is now cancelled.
</p><p>
Evil Dead: The Game - which launched onto Xbox, PlayStation, and PC last May - is another entry in the asymmetrical multiplayer horror genre that's already bought us the likes of Dead by Daylight and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, this one pitting a cast of familiar faces from the Evil Dead movies, including Bruce Campbell's Ash Williams, against the Deadite hordes.

Since its release, sporadic post-launch support has introduced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/free-update-to-evil-dead-the-game-now-available-based-on-army-of-darkness">castle

Xbox boss Phil Spencer has addressed today's mega-leak, calling the confidential Microsoft documents inadvertently made public as part of the company's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ftc-suing-to-block-microsofts-69bn-activision-blizzard-acquisition">court battle with the FTC</a> "old" and saying Xbox will "share [its] real plans when we are ready".

## Tekken 8's CNT is no more as Bandai Namco introduces first Closed Beta Test

Tekken 8's Closed Network Tests are regrettably no more (regrettable if you too <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-in-a-flap-over-tekken-8-closed-network-test-logo">find unintended joy in unfortunately selected acronyms</a>), as Bandai Namco has announced it'll be launching the fighter's first Closed Beta Test this October. 
</p><p>
So while we must sadly bid a fond farewell to the publisher's eye-catching Tekken 8 CNT graphic, we do at least get to snicker at its replacement (I'm assuming nobody at Bandai Namco thought to run 'CBT' through the internet first either) when the next bout of testing gets underway at 8am BST on 20th October. Proceedings will run until 9am on 23rd October, with three hours of downtime scheduled between 9am and 12pm on the 21st.

The recent leak of internal Microsoft documents gives an indication as to what the company expects to pay to get games on Xbox Game Pass.
</p><p>
For instance, Microsoft estimated it would take $300m to get Star Wars Jedi: Survivor on Game Pass, or $250m for either Mortal Kombat 1 or Suicide Squad.

As we reported earlier today, a 2022 email thread initiated by Phil Spencer had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfields-delay-was-disaster-situation-for-xbox-game-pass-phil-spencer-said">Microsoft scrambling to fill the hole in Game Pass left by Starfield's delay</a> and included a long list of potential third-party games.

## French President clarifies view on video games after blaming them for riots

French President Emmanuel Macron has clarified his view on video games after previously blaming recent riots on the culture of video games.
</p><p>
Now, in a new statement on X, formerly Twitter, Macron said he startled gamers - or, he literally "made the gamers jump" - with his words and that really he "always considered that video games are an opportunity for France, for our youth and its future, for our jobs and our economy".
</p><p>
He continued: "I expressed my concerns at the end of June because video game codes had been used by offenders to trivialise violence on social networks. It is this violence that I condemn, not video games.

Nintendo is set to update F-Zero 99 with more courses and modes in the near future.
</p><p>
First up, <a href="https://topics.nintendo.co.jp/article/1afbb5e6-8a0a-40b9-806c-6292161c2988">Nintendo's Japanese web page for the game</a> states that two sets of courses will be added. The first will be in late September and taken from the Queen League; the second will be mid-October and from the King League.

</p><p>
At present, the courses in the game are mainly taken from the Knight League, so expect some trickier races in the near future.

This week on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/newscast">Eurogamer Newscast</a>, we're discussing what feels like the biggest leak of Xbox gaming news in history, which has left Microsoft's plans to launch new hardware in 2024 and a new console generation in 2028 exposed. </p><p>Next year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-xbox-series-xs-consoles-detailed-in-enormous-microsoft-leak">redesigned Xbox Series X is digital only</a>, according to documents from 2022 that Microsoft presented to the FTC this year. It does not appear to boast a bump in processing power - something that gels with what Xbox boss Phil Spencer told me at Gamescom last month - but also ditches the ability to play older games on disc.

Phil Spencer admitted the hole in Game Pass left by Starfield's delay was a "disaster situation" and suggested FromSoftware's Dark Souls games to plug the gap following the success of Elden Ring, among other third-party releases.
</p><p>
Today's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-xbox-series-xs-consoles-detailed-in-enormous-microsoft-leak">enormous leak of internal Microsoft documents</a> includes a particularly candid email from Spencer sent in May 2022, revealing his frustration around "a huge hole with our games lineup". That was due to Starfield's delay, "not a tonne of clarity on the launch date of Redfall", and Stalker 2 development impacted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The developer of Baldur's Gate 3 has recommended PlayStation 5 owners take their console offline to fix a sudden spate of game crashes.

Larian noted last night that "some PS5 players" were "experiencing sudden Baldur's Gate 3 crashes in what appears to be a PSN-related issue".

"We're investigating the problem," Larian continued, via a <a href="https://twitter.com/baldursgate3/status/1703876359192244375">post</a> on X, formerly Twitter. "But for now, the workaround is to disconnet your PS5 from the internet."

A close up on Aerith's eyes. She drops a flower. It's crushed underfoot. The camera pans back to an overhead view of Midgar as the orchestra swells and the horns fanfare. We zoom in on a train, Cloud perched on top.
</p><p>
It's an opening that will be familiar to any Final Fantasy 7 fan, from the original game to the recent Remake. Now it's present and correct in Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis too, a new free-to-play mobile game from Square Enix that encapsulates the whole saga and its spin-offs into a single, mission-based package. Initially, with this opening, it makes a good first impression.
</p><p>
But it's all a facade. Ever Crisis is an avalanche of microtransactions and frustrating mobile design that makes one of Square Enix's greatest achievements a miserable experience.

Shadows of Doubt, the ambitious procedural detective noir sandbox from developer Cole Jefferies, is introducing new cases themed around infidelity on 25th September, as part of its first major update since entering Steam early access in April.
</p><p>
Shadows of Doubt, for those in need of a quick refresher, is a first-person, open-world detective sim set in a noirish sci-fi city. Its unique selling point, however, is that procedural generation governs virtually every aspect of it in a bid to create an endlessly replayable crime-solving caper - from the layout of its city streets to the schedules of its citizens, right through to the cases you'll need to solve through stealth, subtrefuge, and sleuthing.
</p><p>
And from next Monday, 25th September, come the arrival of its Cheats and Liars update, Shadows of Doubt will hav

Phil Spencer described Nintendo as "THE prime asset" in a leaked internal email concerning possible Microsoft acquisitions.
</p><p>
The email chain, sent in 2020 between Spencer, chief marketing officer Chris Capossela, and commercial chief marketing officer Takeshi Numoto, discusses the possibility of acquiring Nintendo at some point in the future, with Numoto initially noting Nintendo's "rich set of franchises".
</p><p>
"I totally agree that Nintendo is THE prime asset for us in gaming and today gaming is our most likely path to consumer relevance," replied Spencer.

</p><p>
