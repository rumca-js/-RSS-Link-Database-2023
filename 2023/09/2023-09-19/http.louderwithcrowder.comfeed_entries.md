They were protesting the district's new bathroom rules that let boys use the girl's bathroom if those boys say they are girls. Presumably, girls saying they are boys would be allowed to use the boys' room. But much like when it comes to the lack of stories of girls dominating boys' sports, you don't hear about that all that much.</p><p>The young chad who organizated the walkout, John Ott, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/pennsylvania-high-school-students-organize-walkout-protest-trans-bathroom-rule-compromised-rights" target="_blank">told Fox News</a>: "Kids were upset.

Regretfully, we are back to our regularly scheduled coverage of the wheels coming off the planet. A thousand puppy fetishists gathered in Germany to howl at the moon and demand you take them seriously.</p><p>Gathering at the Berlin Potsamer Platz railroad station in Germany, these *sigh* "canine beings" barked and howled each other while dressed as dogs. Ackshually, "Canine Beings" is the name of the advocacy group. I don't think they identify as "canine beings." You're free to identify them however you feel: "Freaks." "Lunatics." "
