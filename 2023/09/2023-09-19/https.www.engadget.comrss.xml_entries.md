It was swiftly met with backlash for its funky, bane-like aesthetic. Oh, and it's $949 price tag. What no one could have predicted is that, just a few months after Zone launched, a massive Canadian wildfire would billow enough smoke across the East Coast to turn New York City’s skyline into a surreal orange nightmare. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-build-a-box-fan-air-filter-to-escape-the-canada-wildfire-smoke-172043312.html">“orange scare”</a> was a freakishly timely event that drew attention to the climate crisis.

<p>“Let’s charge the iPhone 15 Pro Max before going to bed,” I thought wearily after a long day at Apple Park. Even though the device, which I had just unboxed a few hours earlier, was still showing at least 80 percent left of juice, I wanted to make sure it didn’t run out the next day. Time with a new review unit is precious, and I couldn’t risk wasting any of it on a dead phone.</p><p>I dragged myself over to the work desk in my hotel room, unplugged my iPhone 14 Pro and stuck the Lightning charger into the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-15-pro-has-a-titanium-case-an-action-button-and-usb-c-181257580.html">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>.

<p>Netgear just announced a new flagship router, the Orbi 970, that’s absolutely brimming with features. The router supports the newest Wi-Fi 7 wireless standard and ships in a quad-band format, so it also handles other formats like Wi-Fi 6, 5 and 2.4. It boasts speeds up to 27 Gbps and includes 12 “high-performance antennas” for 360-degree coverage, with mesh satellite devices available for an even larger wireless footprint.</p><p>The Orbi 970 was quite obviously designed with modern consumers in mind, so it should excel when streaming 4K or even 8K video, engaging with high-output VR and AR applications, UHD video conferencing, online gaming and everything else people get up to online these days. The system's also smart-home friendly with the capacity to connect up to 200 devices.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The ultrawide bandwidth router is fully compatible with older wireless standards and it's a quad-band device, so everything should work at once without too much

The executive talked about how Nintendo was the prime asset for the tech giant in gaming, which is Microsoft's best bet for consumer relevance. He was confident that if there was an American company capable of acquiring Nintendo, it was Microsoft. However, Nintendo was apparently sitting on a "big pile of cash" that made it unlikely to go looking for buyers.&nbsp;</p><p>Spencer added that Nintendo had a board of directors that had not pushed for increases in market growth in ages.
