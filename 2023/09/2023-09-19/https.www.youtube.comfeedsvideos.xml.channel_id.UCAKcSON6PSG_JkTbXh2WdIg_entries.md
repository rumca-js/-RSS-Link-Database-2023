In The Current's studio, @TashSultanaMusic orchestrated a carefully choreographed performance of  "Jungle"  using numerous loops to lay down guitar tracks — starting with the basic chord progression, then moving to ornamentation, followed by a bassline. At that point, they shifted to percussion, and when all the pieces were in place, started singing to the layers of music they create. Sultana also adds some rocking guitar parts to each song, showcasing a playing style that invites comparisons to Prince.

Twenty years into a hip-hop career that includes 10 years as part of the acclaimed group Run The Jewels, Killer Mike has released the solo album, "Michael," (available on @LomaVistaRecs) so that people would get to know the more personal side of Michael Render, “that little nine-year-old boy on the album cover with the horns and the halo and the buck teeth and the smile.”

From a session recorded live in The Current studio, watch Killer Mike and the Midnight Revival Choir perform "MOTHERLESS" from the album.
