Called gas vesicles (GVs), these structures are naturally produced by certain microorganisms and are responsible for controlling the microorganism's buoyancy in water. Researchers can genetically engineer human cells to produce these gas vesicles, resulting in an ultrasound contrast medium capable of revealing deep tissue structures at the resolution of a single cell.", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2023-09-approach-cells-enable-molecular-medical.html", "date_published": "2023-09-19T06:19:00+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "album": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "user": null, "language": "en-us", "thumbnail": "https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/tmb/2023/novel-approach-to-engi-1.jpg"}, {"source": "https://phys.org/rss-feed/", "title": "Gene required for root hair growth, nitrate foraging found in grasses", "description": "Scientists have found a plant gene that drives the growth of root hairs, the tiny structures that help plants find water and nutrients in the soil.", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2023-09-gene-required-root-hair-growth.html", "date_published": "2023-09-19T06:18:03+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "album": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "user": null, "language": "en-us", "thumbnail": "https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/tmb/2023/gene-required-for-root.jpg"}, {"source": "https://phys.org/rss-feed/", "title": "Near-surface permafrost could be nearly gone by 2100, scientists conclude", "description": "Most of Earth's near-surface permafrost could be gone by 2100, an international team of scientists has concluded after comparing current climate trends to the planet's climate 3 million years ago.", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2023-09-near-surface-permafrost-scientists.html", "date_published": "2023-09-19T06:13:18+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "album": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "user": null, "language": "en-us", "thumbnail": "https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/tmb/2023/permafrost-1.jpg"}, {"source": "https://phys.org/rss-feed/", "title": "Women from diverse backgrounds still face leadership barriers, says Australian study", "description": "Australian leaders with diverse backgrounds have expressed a sense of resignation and despair about the lack of women from First Nations and Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) backgrounds in leadership roles.", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2023-09-women-diverse-backgrounds-leadership-barriers.html", "date_published": "2023-09-19T04:10:24+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "album": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "user": null, "language": "en-us", "thumbnail": "https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/tmb/2021/women.jpg"}]
