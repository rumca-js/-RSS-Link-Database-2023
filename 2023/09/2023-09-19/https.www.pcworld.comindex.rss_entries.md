<p>Google&rsquo;s Bard AI chat bot just got a set of updates that might finally give it widespread appeal. On Tuesday, Google announced the integration of its generative AI into its apps and services&mdash;meaning you can now use Bard to dig through your messages, documents, and more to help speed up life&rsquo;s daily tasks.</p>



<p>Announced on Tuesday <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blog.google/products/bard/google-bard-new-features-update-sept-2023/&amp;xcust=2-1-2073592-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">in a blog post</a>, Google says its improvements to its PaLM 2 AI model enables new features that include Bard Extensions, which allows Bard to connect to Gmail, Drive, YouTube, Maps, Travel, and more. The idea is to make the chat bot more like a personal assistant&mdash;one that can comb thro

<p><em>Baldur&rsquo;s Gate III</em> is a pretty fantastic RPG that&rsquo;s getting a ton of love, even as the big fall releases arrive. It&rsquo;s well-made, incredibly deep with its <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>combat and character system, and the writing and voice acting are top-notch. But part of the reason it&rsquo;s exploding in popularity has to be the rise of live play RPGs like <em><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1499840/skip-hogwarts-legacy-and-watch-some-harry-potter-style-dd-instead.html">Dimension 20</a></em> and <em>Critical Role</em>. Those two worlds will collide later this week, when the voice cast of <em>Baldur&rsquo;s Gate III</em> will sit down and roll some dice in the real world. </p>



<p>For the uninitiated, live play or actual play is an emerging format wherein you just&hellip;watch a bunch of people play <em>Dungeons &amp; Drag

<p>Intel&rsquo;s new 14th-gen Core chip, Meteor Lake, is designed as much for Intel as it is for you. A new disaggregation scheme separates the &ldquo;processor&rdquo; into four tiles, cutting power and increasing yields. But a doubling of graphics performance and a new AI engine helps cater to consumers seeking new features.</p>



<p>Let&rsquo;s be clear, though: Meteor Lake was not designed with CPU performance in mind. Intel executives describe Meteor Lake as offering the performance of the current 13th-gen chip, Raptor Lake, but at half the power &mdash; aided by new low-voltage efficiency cores (E-cores) that are new to the platform. Even the way Intel assigns CPU tasks has been flipped on its head, pushing them first towards the <em>lowest-power</em> E-cores, then migrating them to the more power-hungry performance cores if need be.</p>

<p>Intel&rsquo;s 14th-gen mobile processor, code-named Meteor Lake, represents a dramatic shift from the chips Intel has shipped for years &mdash; and Intel has provided us with a ton of information. If you don&rsquo;t have time to wade through it all, however, we&rsquo;ve summed up the most important points here.</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s what you need to know about Meteor Lake. For a much more detailed examination of what this new generation of processors offers, please see our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2055579/inside-meteor-lake-intels-14th-gen-core-cpu-optimized-for-the-future.html">deep-dive into Meteor Lake.</a></p>

Logitech said that the Yeti product name would stick around, integrated into new offerings yet to come. Today we&rsquo;re seeing the consolidation effort. The Yeti GX is Logitech&rsquo;s new flagship USB microphone, complete with a jet-black aesthetic and gamer LEDs. A smaller Yeti Orb is the successor to the Blue Snowball. </p>

<p>Microsoft Paint used to be an app we all took for granted. That is, we did until Microsoft tried to put it out to pasture several years ago. After the public outcry, Paint <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/397461/microsoft-paint-keyboard-controls-may-2019-windows-update.html">didn&rsquo;t just get a reprieve</a>. It got a new lease on life&mdash;no mere stay of execution, but rather, fresh features started being added to the program. The latest additions: support for transparency and layers.</p>

<p>The successor to the long-known BIOS system, dubbed UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface), serves as your motherboard firmware on every newer computer. Even though most people still call it &ldquo;BIOS&rdquo; instead of the proper &ldquo;UEFI,&rdquo; the replacement of the previous BIOS (Basic Input Output System) was a necessary step because of the support of 64-bit systems.</p>



<p>There are further advantages: UEFI can manage partitions and hard drives with a capacity of more than two terabytes, supports not only the classic MBR format (Master Boot Record) but also the GUID partition table (GPT) and can handle up to 128 primary partitions &mdash; with BIOS there were only four.</p>



<p>UEFI surpasses its predecessor in everyday use. The interface has a modern look and offers several languages to choose from, making it easier to find your way around

<p>Apple usually commands the highest degree of fan loyalty and customer satisfaction. No longer. In a recent survey, Samsung tied Apple for the best computer experience.</p>



<p>According to the ACSI Household Appliance and Electronics Study 2022-2023, Samsung and Apple tied with a top score of 83 out of 100. The survey was based on interviews with 14,069 customers, chosen at random and contacted via email between July 2022 and June 2023.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s not to say that most consumers criticized their PC. While Apple and Samsung earned the top marks with a score of 83, the lowest &mdash; Lenovo &mdash; still generated a satisfaction index of 78 on a scale from 1 to 100.</p>



<p>ACSI also asked consumers whether they favored desktops, laptops, or tablets. Consumer preferences again tended to prefer desktops, and even more strongly than in 2022: desktops
