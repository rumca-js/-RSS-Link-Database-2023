An international group of scientists, including botanists at the University of Oxford's Botanic Garden, has issued an urgent call for coordinated action to save the iconic genus Rafflesia, which contains the world's largest flowers. This follows a new study that found that most of the 42 species are severely threatened, yet just one of these is listed in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List of Threatened Species. Furthermore, over two-thirds (67%) of the plants' habitats are unprotected and at risk of destruction.

While many species are undergoing drastic declines in their numbers and geographic ranges, other species seem to be thriving. Researchers investigating the great-tailed grackle, a bird that has been establishing new populations across North America in the past few decades, reveal that behavior might play a key role in their success. They found that the population on the range's edge is more persistent and has more variability in flexibility, and that this species has shifted toward living more in urban, arid environments.

The intricate interplay of gene expression within living cells is akin to a well-orchestrated symphony, with each gene playing its part in perfect harmony to ensure cells function as they should. At the heart of this symphony are transcription factors (TFs), molecular maestros that regulate the expression of genes by binding to specific DNA sequences known as promoters.

Would you help a complete stranger in desperate need of money, based solely on their social media posts? Simon Fraser University professor and bioethicist Jeremy Snyder examines the complex dimensions of this question in his new book, "Appealing to the Crowd: The Ethical, Political, and Practical Dimensions of Donation-Based Crowdfunding" (Oxford University Press, 2023), which highlights how online crowdfunding—while helping to meet immediate needs—also impacts privacy and dignity, worsens inequalities, doesn't solve systemic issues, and most often falls short of its goals.

## Environmental assessments should factor in ecological connectivity, say researchers

There is a growing call among researchers, funding bodies and developers to integrate considerations of ecological connectivity in environmental assessments (EAs) of proposed development projects. This refers to the degree to which a natural landscape remains unbroken by a development project, be it a road, mine, transmission line or hydro dam. These projects have the potential to impede wildlife movement across altered z, with important consequences for migration, genetic diversity, population abundance, climate resilience, disease resistance and more.

Pacific Oscillation (APO), a dominant mode of atmospheric variability characterized by a seesaw variation in the upper-tropospheric temperature between Asia and the North Pacific, plays important roles in the atmospheric circulation and climate of East Asia. A recent study using state-of-the-art climate models projected a weakening of the winter APO in the expected warmer world of the second half of the 21st century. However, the nature of its relationship with the atmospheric circulation and climate of East Asia in the future remains unknown.

Woody biomass and wheat straw are all sources of the natural polymer lignin with more than 50 megatons of lignin produced annually at commercial scale. However, most is burned to produce energy, which alternatively could be used to make useful chemicals. A major issue with producing chemicals from lignin is that the properties of lignin vary from source to source and from season to season. Such variability can affect the yield and quality of the chemicals produced from lignin.

"Titanic," James Cameron's 1997 multi-Oscar-winning movie, focused on the tragic love story of itinerant artist Jack and upper-class socialite Rose. Among their other on-board adventures, they dined in the first-class section of the ship before joining revelers dancing in the third-class quarters. Their exploration of the ill-fated vessel represents a transgression—not just of public boundaries, but of class ones too.

A tiny molecular structure that looks like a bubble may be able to significantly improve medical imaging, according to a Penn State research team. Called gas vesicles (GVs), these structures are naturally produced by certain microorganisms and are responsible for controlling the microorganism's buoyancy in water. Researchers can genetically engineer human cells to produce these gas vesicles, resulting in an ultrasound contrast medium capable of revealing deep tissue structures at the resolution of a single cell.
