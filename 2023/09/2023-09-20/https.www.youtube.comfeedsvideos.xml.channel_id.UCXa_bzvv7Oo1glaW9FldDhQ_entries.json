The expansion is some of the best content CD Projekt RED has ever produced, shining brightly thanks to its captivating story, excellently written and performed characters, significant improvements to its progression and customization systems, and consistently thrilling combat and stealth gameplay, among a host of other improvements. \n\nPhantom Liberty finally makes good on the lofty promises that CD Projekt RED made for the Cyberpunk 2077 base game for so long, by not only being an excellent chunk of new content in and of itself, but being so good that it even uplifts the entire base game to altogether new heights as well.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQVMoy2Sps8", "date_published": "2023-09-20T15:00:37+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/gQVMoy2Sps8/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "The Starfield - Star Citizen Comparison Makes ZERO SENSE...", "description": "Bethesda\u2019s highly anticipated Starfield was just recently released for PC and Xbox Series X/S, and a shining Metacritic score of 87 is proof of the excellent critical reception of the game. While most fans are having a lot of fun exploring and questing in this new Bethesda universe, Starfield\u2019s release has also invited a lot of comparisons to Robert Industries\u2019 ongoing MMO Star Citizen. \n\nOne might be forgiven to think that these comparisons are just since both games are about space exploration at their core - but once you look into the nitty gritty details, you will notice that these comparisons are oversimplifying things to the point of being nonsensical.
