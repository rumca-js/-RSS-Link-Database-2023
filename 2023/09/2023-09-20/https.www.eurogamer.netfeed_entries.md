Glen Schofield, the co-creator of Dead Space, is departing his Striking Distance Studios following the commercial failure of its first game, sci-fi horror The Callisto Project. 
</p><p>
Schofield founded Striking Distance Studios in 2019, under the wing of a Korean publisher Krafton Inc., which was looking to create a narrative-based game that would expand its PUBG: Battlegrounds universe - although, notably, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-space-creators-the-callisto-protocol-has-ditched-ties-with-pubg-universe">all connections to PUBG had been excised</a> by the time The Callisto Project launched in December last year.

Tomb Raider developer Crystal Dynamics has confirmed ten employees have lost their jobs as part of "internal restructuring" efforts, following multiple accounts from employees that the studio had been hit with lay offs today.
</p><p>
Senior brand manager Nicholas Edwards announced his departure from Crystal Dynamics in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7110332213149216768/">message shared on LinkedIn</a>, revealing he was "one of a number of people impacted by the latest round of Embracer layoffs" at the studio. Edwards noted today's job cuts had affected a broad spread of departments, including PR, project management, 2D art, and video editing.

Following the surprise news earlier that Paradox Interactive's beleaguered Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is now in the hands of  Everybody's Gone to the Rapture and Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs studio The Chinese Room, the developer has talked a little about its goals for the rejuvenated project, saying it's building its action around 'doing things only a vampire can'.
</p><p>
Bloodlines 2 has, of course, had a tumultuous journey since its unveiling back in 2019; original developer Hardsuit Labs was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-pulls-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-from-dev-cans-pre-orders">ditched</a> following a number of controversies, almost resulting in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-says-it-almost-cancelled-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-earlier-this-year">cancellation</a> of th

UK regulatory body the Competition and Markets Authority is reportedly preparing to share its preliminary judgement on Microsoft's revised Activision Blizzard deal next week.
</p><p>
The CMA is, of course, Microsoft's last remaining hurdle in getting its proposed $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard over the finish line after the UK regulator made the shock decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-blocks-microsoft-activision-blizzard-deal">block the deal</a> in April, highlighting concerns relating to the burgeoning cloud gaming sector and arguing the deal would risk "stifling competition in this growing market".

Criterion, the British studio behind recent Need for Speed titles and the classic Burnout series, will now focus the majority of its efforts on EA's Battlefield shooter franchise.
</p><p>
A smaller "core group" within Criterion will continue on with Need for Speed, meanwhile.
</p><p>
Criterion has of course worked on Battlefield before, and contributed bits to DICE's Battlefield V and Battlefield 2042 (it also helped out on Star Wars Battlefront 2). The talented team will now turn its efforts back to improving 2042, and to the future of the Battlefield franchise overall.

</p><p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-netflixs-onimusha-anime">adaptation was revealed a year ago byCapcom</a>, along with a few stills from the show. Its protagonist is Musashi Miyamoto, whose likeness is modelled after prolific Japanese actor Mifune Toshiro (best known for his roles in Akira Kurosawa's films including Seven Samurai). The series is directed by Takashi Miike (Audition, Ichi the Killer, 13 Assassins).
</p><p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1wsUxg68Ek">new trailer</a> shows snippets of action sequences and reveals hints of the plot. Netflix describes the first episode as "the beginning of an intense series full of realistic action in which Musashi

Early Access can seem like the prescience of Paul "Muad'Dib" Atreides, the saviour, prophet, and eventually emperor in Frank Herbert's series of Dune novels. As a game releases into Early Access, you can see the possibilities ahead of it, the design decisions it might and might not incorporate, the vague outline of the finished work. As Early Access progresses, the possibility space narrows; the outline solidifies.
</p><p>
But if there is one theme to take away from Herbert's work, it is that seeing the possibilities does not necessarily enable one to make the most of them. Paul rose to be the messianic leader of the Fremen, the indigenous people of Arrakis' deserts living under the boot of House Harkonnen and the imperial House Corrino that licenced their occupation, but his rise was irrevocably tied to billions of

Yesterday's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-xbox-series-xs-consoles-detailed-in-enormous-microsoft-leak">mammoth leak of Microsoft documentation</a> was eye-opening for all sorts of reasons, not least because it laid bare the company's tentative hardware plans for the back half of this console generation. But the scale of the leak was only part of the surprise. Equally stunning was Microsoft's plan - circa April 2022, at least - to ditch physical media altogether in new Xbox consoles from next year, for what it privately described as an "adorably all digital" future. 
</p><p>
Of course, Microsoft has now responded - via a short social media <a href="https://twitter.com/XboxP3/status/1704233222752571842">post</a> from Xbox boss Phil Spencer that quickly sought to reframe the leak as outdated without getting into the detai

Terraria developer Re-Logic is donating $100k to two open source engines in the wake of Unity's recent policy changes.
</p><p>
Re-Logic does not even use Unity, but in a <a href="https://twitter.com/Terraria_Logic/status/1704227519027651016?s=20">statement</a> via X (formerly Twitter) the developer said it felt it "cannot sit idly by as these predatory moves are made against studios everywhere".
</p><p>
Godot and FNA will receive $100k each, and Re-Logic will also continue sponsoring both with a further $1k per month. "All we ask in return is that they remain good people and keep doing all that they can to make these engines powerful and approachable for developers everywhere," said Re-Logic.

</p><p>
On the low end, you're looking at a Nvidia GeForce 1060 or AMD Radeon RX 570 with 8GB RAM. On the high end, you'll need a Nvidia GeForce 3080 or AMD Radeon 6900 with 16GB RAM.
