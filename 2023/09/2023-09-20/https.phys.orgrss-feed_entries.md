The formation of dissipative solitons is influenced by several factors, such as spectral filtering effects and Kerr nonlinear effects. This interaction leads to the possibility of mode locking over a wide range of parameters, generating pulses whose type and evolution are completely different from the conventional physical laws and optical properties, tolerating higher nonlinear effects and thus effectively avoiding the generation of pulse splitting. The physical laws and optical properties offer a major improvement over the conventional optical pulse.

For most of the history of astronomy, all we could see were stars. We could see them individually, in clusters, in nebulae, and in fuzzy blobs that we thought were clumps of stars but were actually galaxies. The thing is, most of what's out there is much harder to see than stars and galaxies. It's gas.

## Study: The bold, not the capable, make the most of big cities

Big cities may offer the best jobs, the most compelling experiences, and the most exciting opportunities. But there is a cost: With higher housing and living costs, cities are only affordable by those able to secure the best jobs and the highest salaries. Economists would thus expect a strong self-selection for migration to cities based on ability—only the most able, the argument goes, should choose to live in a big city, because they are the ones with the best chances to earn the money needed to enjoy city life. In reality, however, such a stark self-selection is not observable in the data.

The Amazon river basin is known for its immense and lush tropical forests, so one might assume that the Amazon's land is equally rich. In fact, the soils underlying the forested vegetation, particularly in the hilly uplands, are surprisingly infertile. Much of the Amazon's soil is acidic and low in nutrients, making it notoriously difficult to farm.

For diabetes patients who must give themselves frequent insulin injections, the risk of low blood sugar can be life-threatening. A potential solution is a type of engineered insulin that circulates in the body and springs into action only when needed. Researchers working on this type of "glucose-responsive insulin" (GRI) hope that it could be injected less often and help the body maintain normal blood sugar levels for longer periods of time.

One proven method for tracking down the genetic causes of diseases is to knock out a single gene in animals and study the consequences this has for the organism. The problem is that for many diseases, the pathology is determined by multiple genes. This makes it extremely difficult for scientists to determine the extent to which any one of the genes is involved in the disease. To do this, they would have to perform many animal experiments—one for each desired gene modification.

As summer turns to fall, many people will be turning off the air conditioning and firing up heaters instead. But traditional heating and cooling systems are energy-intensive, and because they typically run on fossil fuels, they aren't sustainable. Now, by mimicking a desert-dwelling chameleon, a team reporting in Nano Letters has developed an energy-efficient, cost-effective coating. The material could keep buildings cool in the summers—or warm in the winters—without additional energy.

Blue light is vital for light-emitting devices, lighting applications, as well as smartphone screens and large screen displays. However, it is challenging to develop efficient blue organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), owing to the high applied voltage required for their function. Conventional blue OLEDs typically require around 4 V for a luminance of 100 cd/m2. This is higher than the industrial target of 3.7 V—the voltage of lithium-ion batteries commonly used in smartphones. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel blue OLEDs that can operate at lower voltages.

Over the past two decades, coral reefs have declined at unprecedented rates. This is in part because of extreme weather events, which cause wide-spread coral bleaching, a process during which corals lose their color because of stressors, including changes in water temperature, light, or nutrient availability. One of the worst mass bleaching events occurred in 2016 and 2017 on the Great Barrier Reef, causing bleaching on 91% of the system's reefs.
