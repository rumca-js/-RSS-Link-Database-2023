<p>In the 1950s and 60s, before fear and stupidity dominated US energy politics, it was thought that by the turn of the 21st century about half of the electrical power in America would be generated from nuclear energy. Unfortunately, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_China_Syndrome">Jane Fonda making a sad face</a> was so distressing to the mentally-stunted among us that they lobbied–successfully!–for us to commit civilizational energy suicide. Today we continue to burn coal and natural gas which, unlike nuclear power generation, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/nuclear-energy#putting-death-rates-from-energy-in-perspective">provably kills people</a>.
