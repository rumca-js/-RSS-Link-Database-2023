<p>Arsenal sat themselves back at the top table and, long before the end, could recline in comfort. It will not always be this easy for Mikel Arteta’s players if, as should be expected of all the Premier League’s resource-rich representatives, they travel far in this season’s competition but a slick and clinical outing bodes well for now. They were hardly troubled by a PSV Eindhoven side that laudably came to play but had no answer whatsoever to the hosts’ speed and intent. If this is the standard of opposition in Group B it would be a surprise if qualification was not settled well before the final match.</p><p>Goals from Bukayo Saka, Leandro Trossard and Gabriel Jesus ended proceedings as a contest before half-time but it will encourage Arteta that, while the second period was barren for long periods, Arsenal’s focus never wavered.

<p>There’s nothing long term about the prime minister diluting green policies in the hope of clinging on to power</p><p>You could sense the panic when news was leaked of Rishi Sunak’s plans to water down some of his climate change targets. Instead of a controlled speech later in the week – probably somewhere with green connections: Rish! never knowingly undersells the irony – we got a hastily arranged press conference. In the very same Downing Street media centre where No 10 staff had joked about having illegal parties during the pandemic. Call it karma. Stay calm and carry on taking the piss out of the country.</p><p>And breathe. Sunak strode into the room and stood in front of a lectern with a sign reading “long-term decisions for a brighter future” on the front. Gaslighting the country again. It’s getting to be a habit. He then opened his mouth. RishGPT can’t really help the entitled, nasal whine. But this time it came soaked in contempt. This wasn’t just patronising, it was the m

Popular folk singer and whistler best known for his 1969 hit Durham Town (the Leavin’)<p>Although there was never any such phenomenon as Whittakermania, Roger Whittaker, who has died aged 87, built a huge international following in a career that spanned six decades. As the Boston Globe noted of his stage performances: “No one gets high. No one gets hysterical with excitement. And yet Roger Whittaker is one of the most popular entertainers in the world.”</p><p>Whittaker’s smooth baritone voice and songs of love, loss and yearning endeared him to audiences worldwide. His best known songs, where his voice was invariably accompanied by keening strings, included 1969’s Durham Town (the Leavin’), I Don’t Believe in If Anymore (1970), which reached No 8 in the UK, The Last Farewell (1971, reissued in 1975 to become a Top 20 hit in the US and a chart-topper in 11 countries), and Wind Beneath My Wings (1982).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/sep/20/roger-whittaker-obituary"

Is it the simplest and most direct way to say what is meant? Is it persuasive? Among the admirable results of her method are memoirs that manage to be at once tender, loving, clear-eyed and unsparing, sentences that seem effortless even when we can easily imagine how painful they must have been to set down on the page.</p><p>Her best-known works fall into three broad categories. Some, most notably A Man’s Place, focus on her childhood in a small town in northern France, where the solidly working-class values of her parents, who ran a grocery-cafe, made it complicated for their daughter to move into a bourgeois milieu that involved writing and eventually celebrity.

The song still resonates, demonstrating the chilling, natural power of delta blues, the profound isolation experienced by inmates, the harshness of prison labour camps, and the deep, almost visceral need to let song sustain you; to

<p>This delicate novel traces a young woman’s awakening, from 1950s country house parties to not-so-swinging London and an unhappy marriage</p><p>At one point in this slim coming-of-age novel, Rose Tremain’s 17th, the main character, Marianne, is accused by her husband, Hugo, of being “a bloody difficult person to like”. Marianne is genuinely perturbed. She married him more than 10 years before, when she was just 20. It is the early 1970s, Hugo runs a London auction house, and they are in Paris – Marianne has been patiently looking at model puppet theatres all day. She is doing her very best, she thinks. And it dawns on her, then, that her very best “resembled the antics of a stricken kind of creature, like a sick grey parrot in a cage”. Kind Hugo, an enormous, ginger-haired, horse-loving friend of the family, adores her. They still call each other by teenage nicknames, sparked by once dressing up together in shaggy fur coats: he is “Anthracite”, she “Yeti”. But as Marianne trails ar

<p>Lila Schmitz’s documentary offers a candid look at Irish music and community struggles in a small Irish village known for its bar-room sessions</p><p>That The Banshees of Inisherin may apparently be a documentary is the main takeaway of this swift but wide- and deep-ranging investigation into the musical community of Doolin, County Clare. It’s a truism to point out the absorption with the landscape in Irish folk music, and a certain attendant melancholia.

Unless you’re thinking of jumping?”</p><p>Once a remote scrum of thatched cottages, Doolin is now on the tourist trail thanks to its uninterrupted tradition of bar-room sessions – in which all-comers are welcome to pitch in with whatever musical talent they have.

<p>This year activists demonstrated against the use of cashmere and leather, but fashion is fertile ground for protests, as Katharine Hamnett proved 40 years ago when she shocked Margaret Thatcher with an anti-cruise missile T-shirt</p><p>Last Friday, on the first day of London fashion week, a woman dressed as a goat screamed as passersby on a busy London shopping street looked on, aghast. “I had pieces of fake hair attached to me, which were torn off to imitate the suffering in the production of cashmere,” says Lucy Ferguson, who played the part of the goat. The 25-year-old activist for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) said: “Underneath were [simulated] bloody wounds that replicated how the strips of sensitive skin are torn away from goats.” The action was intended to raise awareness about the <a href="https://www.peta.org.uk/features/mongolia-cashmere/">cruelty often involved in the process of “combing” for cashmere</a>.

<p>In 2020, in a bid to cut carbon emissions, Luxembourg made all its public transport free. But what is it like to use? And why are there still so many traffic jams? I took a trip to find out ...</p><p>It’s not quite John o’Groats to Land’s End, let alone Florida to Alaska, but undertaking an end-to-end expedition across Luxembourg has its advantages. The first is that you can do it in a morning: it’s about three hours by public transport. The second is the journey won’t cost you a cent. That’s right – total cost for two buses and two trains, travelling about 60 miles: zero euros. Since March 2020, all public transport in Luxembourg has been entirely free to use. While elsewhere in Europe rural bus routes are disappearing and train travel can be more expensive than driving or even flying, Luxembourg has taken things in the opposite direction: improving its transport services and dispensing with fares altogether, with a view to easing traffic congestion, reducing inequality and meeti

My father also used to play for the Chilean national team a long time ago. We’re five brothers in total.

I can’t even tell you what this means for us. We were crying after the first game. We know how much work he has put in and watching him on the field, at a World Cup, when the anthem was playing, that was one of the proudest moments for all of us.

<p>In an extract from a new book, the comedian Andy Hamilton recalls going to his first game aged six – with scant supervision</p><p>Are you the romantic type? Do you believe in love at first sight? A lot of people do, don’t they? From time to time, you meet someone who says something like, “The first moment I saw her I <em>knew</em> I was going to marry her,” and you try not to be disturbed by how much they sound like a stalker. It is possible, I suppose, that your future could appear before you in a split second of revelation, but, in my experience, love is more subtle than that. I have never been struck by that thunderbolt of instant adoration. Well, apart from once.</p><p>The date was 5 November 1960. It was a Saturday. Saturday was the best day of any week because it was the holy day of football. No professional football was allowed to take place on Sundays because, according to the Bible, our supreme, eternal, all-powerful God got too tired if he worked a seven-day week. Conseq

A field. That’s it. For 86 minutes this thoughtful, meditative documentary reveals the comings and goings: sunsets, sunrises, the midnight frolics of bunnies, the odd crisp packet blowing in. It’s unlikely to be storming a multiplex near you – though the opening scene does feature the close-up of a corpse. The unfortunate creature in question however is a field mouse that appears – limbs present and correct – to have expired from natural causes.

<p>When I started doing sensory stimulation workshops, I worried that playing music for the group would fall flat. I couldn’t have been more wrong</p><p>In 2013 I was in my last year studying theatre and performance at the University of Leeds. I was a fairly normal student, I think. I sometimes worked hard, often drank too much and thought I was really cool, even though I definitely wasn’t. There were lots of things I didn’t know, but one thing I was sure of: after university, I was going to go to drama school and then become an actor. You know, in movies and stuff.</p><p>During our final module of the term, I found myself standing outside Berkeley Court care home on a drizzly afternoon with three course mates and an underdeveloped idea. We planned to do sensory stimulation workshops with the residents in an attempt to inspire memory and social engagement.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/sep/20/a-moment-that-changed-me-i-played-my-way-to-people-with-dementi
