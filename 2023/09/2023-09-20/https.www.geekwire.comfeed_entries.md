But in a change from the past, there was lot more stage time for software enhancements, AI features, and paid subscription services, and not as much focus on new Echo devices. Put another way, there was no Alexa-enabled microwave anywhere to be found. The shift suggests a sharper focus in the Alexa and Echo division after a difficult year that included cutbacks as part of a broader shakeout in Amazon&#8217;s corporate and technology workforce.

But the people behind a new cocktail lounge think Seattle has never sounded better thanks to the high-fidelity listening experience they have created. Shibuya Hi-Fi opens Thursday in the Ballard neighborhood with a rather simple plan to offer good drinks and good music. The execution is more nuanced, and involves an expertly curated selection of vinyl records spun by world class DJs in the hopes that people who have given over their listening lives to streaming services and algorithms can get back to basics. &#8220;It&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/on-the-record-new-vinyl-hi-fi-lounge-in-seattle-skips-the-algorithm-and-gets-back-to-music-basics/">Read More</a>

The company operates under laws introduced in 2016 that permit&#160;regulation crowdfunding, a framework that gives small businesses and startups the opportunity to raise capital by selling shares of their company to the public through online platforms. Bean Box&#8217;s crowdfunding launch comes about month after Seattle-based coffee robot barista startup&#160;Artly&#160;started trending on&#160;StartEngine&#160;for its own&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/bean-box

Demonstrated on stage during an event at Amazon&#8217;s HQ2 in Arlington, Va., the feature opens a dedicated session that allows users to converse with Alexa without repeatedly invoking a wake word. Alexa maintains the context of the conversation over time, until the user ends the session, and takes into account preferences such as favorite sports team.

Back in 1985, Ritner launched Seattle&#8217;s first venture group, Puget Sound Venture Club. Its members were early investors in fledging upstarts such as Amazon, DocuSign, Costco, Starbucks, and more than 1,300 other companies. &#8220;When we started, I don&#8217;t think there was a venture capital firm in Seattle,&#8221; Ritner told GeekWire this week. After nearly four decades leading PSVC —&#160;and massive growth of the Seattle tech ecosystem —&#160;Ritner is merging his membership with Alliance of Angels, another longtime Seattle-based investment group founded in 1998.

The analytics company on Wednesday announced a $52.5 million round, bringing total funding to date to $100 million. The Series B round pushes its post-money valuation to $400 million.

Founded last year and led by former Google engineer Jordan Tigani, MotherDuck bills itself as a &#8220;collaborative serverless analytics platform.&#8221; It is built on the open-source platform&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/seattle-startup-motherduck-raises-52-5m-at-a-400m-valuation-to-fuel-duckdb-analytics-platform/">Read More</a>

In this week&#8217;s Xbox leak, a number of documents were submitted as exhibits in Microsoft’s ongoing hearings against the FTC, many of which were accidentally made public. This included an August 2020 email between Spencer and Microsoft marketing leaders Takeshi Numoto and Chris Capossela. The email was primarily dedicated to the chances that Microsoft could acquire or merge with Nintendo, the possibility of&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/could-microsoft-acquire-valve-xbox-leak-highlights-interest-in-potential-bid/">Read More</a>

Scalzi lays out a scenario in which supervillains are basically the CEOs of companies that do dastardly deeds as a service. “The point of the supervillainy is not to hide, but to offer products and services that offer value to your clients, who just happen to be, you know, the United States or China, or some major corporation — so that the supervillainy that you&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/starter-villain-supervillain-tech-billionaires/">Read More</a>
