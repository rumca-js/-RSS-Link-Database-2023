The Teal Mask is yet another step in a slow quality downslide for this series: it runs terribly, looks ugly, feels predictable, doesn’t offer any of the freedom Scarlet and Violet’s main story did, and falls short in so many ways compared to just about every other Pokemon game and DLC we've played.

In today's Fix of entertainment news:
Entertainment Weekly got the scoop on some cool new images from the upcoming Toxic Avenger reboot. The movie, starring Peter Dinklage, looks to be a faithful remake of the original B-movie masterpiece, only with a bigger budget. But maybe extra money loses some of the character's charm? Guess we'll find out when the movie is released later this year. In animation news, a trailer has dropped for the upcoming Netflix series based on the Onimusha video games. Remember those? Think Resident Evil but in feudal Japan. Anyway, the trailer looks awesome and the series will drop this November.

In today's Daily Fix:
Cyberpunk 2077 is getting a massive update ahead of the massive DLC expansion, Phantom Liberty. CD Projekt Red has a tip for anyone diving back into Night City: start a new save. No, nothing will happen to your old one, but the new save balances and adjusts and fixes so many things that the developers want you to experience what appears to be a brand new game with a brand new character. And speaking of game updates, owners of Mortal Kombat 1 on Switch should expect one in the future. After getting savagely—and hilariously—roasted for the subpar Switch port (we gave it a 3...yikes), Mortal Kombat co-creator Ed Boon is promising to address the major issues.

Payday 3 reviewed by Travis Northup on Xbox Series X/S. Also available on PlayStation 5 and PC.
Payday 3 is a solid step forward for my favorite heist simulator franchise, even though that step is a lot smaller than I’d hoped due to a lack of content and the unsurprising but still majorly annoying bugs and performance issues. The awesome combat, greatly improved AI, and especially the stealth options are so massive they alone justify this as a full sequel, and the new and improved heists with clear phases to navigate them are absolutely fantastic. I just wish there was more loot in the proverbial vault at the outset, and that Starbreeze would have used its years of experience in order to ensure this was a more robust and far more stable launch. I’m confident Payday 3 could become the sequel we all deserve with a year or two of updates – for now, it’s a nice start.

Apple’s annual smartphone refreshes have felt especially incremental since the iPhone X, and at first blush that appears to have happened again with the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max. Their attractive titanium edges and useful, customizable Action Button are fairly subtle to the eye, and the first things to get covered up by a case. That is, however, deceptive; Apple has changed quite a bit internally to make this year’s phone its most compelling upgrade since the iPhone 11, especially if you’re passionate about photography or video. While the universal compatibility and transfer speeds of USB-C are the headline addition, the upgraded gaming-ready processor, better camera software, and titanium chassis are all notable improvements.

Created by Emmy Award winner Mike McMahan (Rick and Morty, Solar Opposites), in season four of Star Trek: Lower Decks, an unknown force is destroying starships and threatening galactic peace. Luckily, the crew of the U.S.S. Cerritos isn’t important enough for stuff like that! Instead, Ensigns Mariner, Boimler, Tendi, Rutherford and Provisional Ensign T’Lyn are keeping up with their Starfleet duties, avoiding malevolent computers and getting stuck in a couple caves – all while encountering new and classic aliens along the way.

The Continental: From the World of John Wick, reviewed by Tom Jorgensen

To be very clear, a Continental-focused series never needed John Wick, but it did need to fill the vacuum the character’s absence leaves. The Continental has all the right pieces to the puzzle of telling a story set under the High Table, but compounding miscalculations about how best to put them together leaves the three-episode series feeling inconsequential. John Wick completists interested in a look at how Winston and Charon met and why Winston may have made some of the choices he did in the films have enough to keep them engaged, but there’s no doubt a better way to realize this world on the small screen than the scattershot, half-hearted execution of The Continental.

In today's Daily Fix:

Microsoft's plans for the next five years were accidentally leaked by...Microsoft. Documents were reportedly uploaded to an FTC server, allegedly by someone from Microsoft, that outlines possible upcoming refreshes for the Xbox Series X and Series S, remasters of popular Bethesda titles, a current-gen upgrade for Red Dead Redemption 2, and, of course, Microsoft's next-gen Xbox console slated for release some time in 2028. There's plenty more news in the leaks, but some of the documents aren't exactly recent, so Microsoft's plans may have changed since then. Regardless, it's probably a rough day for Microsoft PR.

Despite Phil Spencer saying multiple times that there is no need for a mid-generation refresh of its Xbox Series game consoles, leaked court documents show that Microsoft is planning to launch hardware refreshes for both the Xbox Series X and S next year.
