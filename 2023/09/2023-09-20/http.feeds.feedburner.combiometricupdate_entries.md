		The GSA and DOL of the United States announced that they are now offering all states the opportunity to use Login.gov with the aim of decreasing fraud and improving security and access in issuing unemployment insurance and other public benefits. This follows the DOL's announcement in May to expand digital ID verification services, anticipating upgrades to the UI system.

Americans can use one single login to access benefits and services at over 40 federal and state agencies through <a href="https://www.login.gov/">Login.gov</a>. Anti-fraud controls will be in place to ensure benefits are going to eligible recipients and not bad actors.

This expansion builds on a 2022 <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/agencies-move-on-digital-id-while-critics-s

		Surveillance cameras with facial recognition are covering <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/cameroon-launches-video-surveillance-with-live-facial-recognition-in-largest-city">more of our cities</a>. But the systems are facing a problem: they are relatively shortsighted.

A new study published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-40110-y">Nature</a> looks at how to optimize surveillance cameras for matching face biometrics from a distance.

The facial recognition method is based on deep learning from a dataset that includes the distance of the individuals from the camera, the focal length of the image sensors and the size in pixels of the target face. The extended dataset was created using the Georgia Tech Face and Quality Datase

One Presidential candidates’ <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/mexico-presidential-candidate-proposes-facial-recognition-to-combat-drug-trafficking">future plans</a> for the system include the introduction of more biometrics.

Over the past two decades, the city's governments have made video surveillance central to policing in an attempt to combat violent crime caused by the drug war.

In 2009, Mexico City’s administration installed the first 8,000 security cameras in the system, an investment totalling over US$400 million. By 2012, 13,000 cameras were installed, and in 2018, the

		Digital identity could be key in the growing problem of identity related cases of fraud. The FinCEN Identity Project found that 1.4 million (37 percent) of the 3.8 million suspicious activity reports (SAR) from 2021 data are related to identity fraud, amounting to $212 billion in all identity fraud related reports, according to a report that will soon be released.

SAR fraud report rates have been steadily rising for a decade and only worsened after the pandemic. For instance, fraud accounted for an estimated <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202309/us-pandemic-fraud-loss-estimates-keep-rising-as-congress-dithers-on-digital-identity">$100 billion to $135 billion</a> of unemployment insurance benefits paid during the pandemic – 11-15 percent of the total amount p

		After years of heated debates and delays, Britain has passed its Online Safety Bill, which could introduce more age verification methods to protect children from online threats, including biometric ones.

The Bill was passed by the UK Parliament on Tuesday and is expected to take effect soon. According to the new rules, social media platforms will have to remove illegal content and prevent children from accessing harmful and age-inappropriate content by enforcing age limits and age-checking measures. Face and voice biometrics <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/uk-online-content-bill-could-quietly-enable-facial-recognition">have been floated</a> as a solution for this task.
