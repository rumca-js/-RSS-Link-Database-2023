<p>The technology behind SD cards is based on flash memory, which retains information securely even without a power supply. Nevertheless, even this technology has its limits.</p>



<p>The electrical charges stored in the memory cells, which represent our data, can become unstable over time. This means they can lose their charge, which in turn leads to data loss in the worst case. But how long does it take for this to happen?</p>



<p>According to the standards for flash memory, to which the manufacturers of SD cards also refer, a memory cell should be able to preserve data for at least ten years at a temperature of 55 degrees Celsius. That sounds reassuring at first, but in practice other factors play a role. </p>

<p>Should you buy a 2007 Honda Accord with 111,000 miles on the odometer and leather upholstery that still looks pretty good, or should you buy a new graphics card? Such is the question I posed to myself after I saw the new <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1935716/asus-revives-rog-matrix-as-a-chart-topping-rtx-4090-with-liquid-metal-inside.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Asus ROG Matrix RTX 4090</a> (and after doing a quick search on my local Craigslist). This no-holds-barred, liquid metal cooled, $4,000 GPU was revealed at Computex. We took a trip to Asus to get an interview from one of its creators, and you can watch it below. </p>



<p>The incredibly customized RTX 4090 has a custom metal frame with an inner and outer chamber, permanently attached to a 360mm triple-fan cooler in all-in-one fashion. It looks like nothing else on the marke

<p>Intel finally took the wraps off its 14th-gen Core processors for laptops this week, powered by the company&rsquo;s radical new &ldquo;Meteor Lake&rdquo; architecture.</p>



<p>It can&rsquo;t be overstated just how much of a change Meteor Lake is for Intel: Rather than using traditional monolithic dies, Meteor Lake is constructed around four chiplet-style &ldquo;tiles:&rdquo; one each for the CPU, the SOC, graphics, and I/O. The new 14th-gen chips also weave in Intel&rsquo;s Arc graphics architecture to provide real-time ray tracing with integrated graphics, as well as the latest Wi-Fi 7 and 6E wireless technologies, among much, much more.</p>



<p>So much more, in fact, that Intel invited a select group of journalists and analysts to Malaysia a few weeks back to detail and show off the new manufacturing process, along with key Meteor Lake technology details.

<p>The AI PC, propelled by Intel&rsquo;s Meteor Lake, is almost here. So why should you care?</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s the billion-dollar question. Intel is building NPU AI inferencing engines into its processors beginning with its 14th-gen Core chip, Meteor Lake, also known as the Core Ultra. Robert Hallock, an AMD veteran now overseeing technical CPU marketing for Intel&rsquo;s microprocessors, said Tuesday that Intel&rsquo;s goal by 2025 is to ship 100 million <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2011031/gelsinger-proclaims-the-ai-pc-era-will-launch-with-meteor-lake.html">&ldquo;AI PCs,&rdquo; a term Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger began using</a> in July.</p>

<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s next huge Windows 11 feature update, code-named Windows 11 23H2, has a big addition: AI. Microsoft is readying for the era of the AI PC with the addition of Windows Copilot, powered by Bing Chat. </p>



<p>It&rsquo;s the closest thing to a theme that we&rsquo;ve seen within a Windows 11 update in some time. AI will power Windows Copilot, of course, but also recommended files in File Explorer and Start as well as a designated AI-specific section within the Microsoft Store app. You should also expect various small improvements across Windows, both in terms of ease-of-use and functional updates, like the ability to restore apps from a backup.</p>



<p>Microsoft has scheduled a press event on Sept. 21 in New York City, and it&rsquo;s there that we expect Microsoft will showcase some of these new features. While it&rsquo;s possible that Microsoft
