The complaint alleges that the bill violates federal and state free speech laws because it “compels companies like X Corp. to engage in speech against their will,” as they’re forced to settle on definitions for “politically-charged” issues like hate speech or r

  <p class="p--has-dropcap" id="NkixMS">As you can imagine, there are a lot of interesting — and occasionally off-the-wall — conversations that take place on <em>The Verge</em>’s Slack channels, especially when the weekend is on its way. One of them occurred recently, when reviewer Jennifer Pattison Tuohy happened to ask how many apps people had on their phones. The reaction was immediate — and actually rather telling. It turns out you can find a lot about a person when you talk to them about their phone — and their apps.</p>

  <p id="hVaYCW">I like big phones, but I cannot lie. They come with tradeoffs. Namely, despite having large hands and piano fingers, my <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23351948/apple-iphone-14-pro-review">iPhone 14 Pro Max</a> doesn’t always feel secure in my grasp.

  <p id="DVEDz9">When he first read the email announcing that public universities in Texas had been asked to ban the use of TikTok on their campuses, UT Dallas student Eric Aaberg feared the worst. As a full-time content creator with over <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@itsericaaberg?lang=en">10,000 followers on the platform</a>, the app was central to his life. Would he be forced to delete it? Would he be punished if he were caught using it?</p>

  <p id="Wl5xsA"><em>Sea of Stars</em> is basically a modern-day SNES RPG. I had a sense that would be the case going in: it has pixel art clearly inspired by 16-bit classics, pits a ragtag group of adventurers against evil forces, uses a clever turn-based battle system, and is filled with stunning music (including a few tracks from <em>Chrono Trigger</em> composer Yasunori Mitsuda). But I was glad my hunch was right. I devoured <em>Sea of Stars</em> in a little over a week, and each time I booted it up, I felt like I was playing the type of old-school RPG I would have spent afternoons with as a kid.</p>
