		The big money stakes for biometrics are on display in the top stories of the week on <em>Biometric Update</em>, with a report of improper influence involving Facewatch’s retail biometrics, the seven-figure acquisition of biometric system integrator Infinite ID and a million-dollar early funding round for federated digital identity provider OneID. The potential reward has prompted Amazon and Innovatrics to invest in synthetic data, while Fuse and Zwipe show progress in opening up the biometric access control card market, and Socure makes its claim on a stake in the emerging age verification market. ConnectID’s CEO shares his views on how digital identity can scale for everyday use.
