A recent paper (Large Langauge Models as Optimizers) by researchers at Google DeepMind found that AI-optimized prompts (via another model) can outperform humans by up to 50% on certain benchmarks.

When I wrote Prompt Engineering Shouldnâ€™t Exist at the start of 2023, I outlined some problems with the then-current state of prompt engineering: complex string-based prompt templates, model-specific prompts, and lack of structured I/O, to name a few. These problems are still pervasive today. Reflecti
