Nickel Creek — the string band comprising Sara Watkins, Sean Watkins and Chris Thile — have been delighting audiences since they were in their teens, but with long-running and wide-ranging music careers, they hadn’t released an original album together since 2014.That changed during the pandemic, when they suddenly got that spark to work together again. The resulting album is Celebrants, released on March 23 of this year.

While Nickel Creek were in town to play a show at the Palace Theatre, they visited The Current studio to play songs and to chat with host Mac Wilson. Watch and listen to the complete session above.
