<ul><li>American teenager wins 2-6, 6-3, 6-2 </li><li>Gauff claims her first grand slam title in style</li></ul><p>Most prodigies never live up to the hype. Even for those who were sufficiently talented in the first place, there are so many obstacles on the pathway to success, so many ways that a sporting career can be derailed.</p><p>Since her breakthrough four years ago, however, Coco Gauff has shown that her mental fortitude and emotional maturity are equal to any singular tennis shot and those qualities have carried her all the way to the top. In the biggest match of her life against the best player in the world, Gauff drew upon those qualities once more as she brilliantly recovered from a one-set deficit to topple Aryna Sabalenka, the second seed, 2-6, 6-3, 6-2.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/sep/10/coco-gauff-battles-back-to-stun-aryna-sabalenka-and-claim-us-open-title">Continue reading...</a>

<p>No amount of spooky jump-scares can save Kenneth Branagh’s latest Christie adaptation, which wastes its atmospheric setting and stellar cast</p><p>Screenwriter Michael Green and director-star Kenneth Branagh have coaxed another gold-effect egg from that plump goose which is the Agatha Christie estate. Legendary moustachioed Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot, played by Branagh, is back for another ensemble outing with many biggish-to-big names phoning it in for the paycheck. This movie appears to be trying for a tougher, nastier, horror-ish feel, perhaps to scoop up some of the younger scary-movie fanbase alongside the Werther’s Original demographic that normally turns out for this kind of thing.</p><p>The timeline follows on from the previous Poirot case, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/07/death-on-the-nile-review-kenneth-branagh-agatha-christie">Death on the Nile</a>; the year is 1947, and Hercule Poirot is in genial retirement in Venice, where he employs ex-cop Vi

Still, McTominay’s now continual use of the international platform to prove what value he could have at club level must turn heads.</p><p>Scotland’s comprehensive 3-0 success in Larnaca on Friday evening had McTominay at its core. The 26-year-old played with control and poise but would be forgiven pent-up frustration. Ten Hag has used him only in the dying stages of the wins against Wolves and Nottingham Forest in the domestic campaign.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/09/scott-mctominay-scotland-manchester-united

<p>Kyle Walker has certainly bided his time. Twelve years on from his England debut and on the occasion of his 77th cap, the Manchester City right-back finally scored for his country. It was an important one, too, his cool finish before half-time cancelling out Oleksandr Zinchenko’s opener for Ukraine and ensuring that England came home with something from a collective 6/10 performance.</p><p>Walker was the outstanding player on the pitch, his speed on the defensive cover so reassuring for Gareth Southgate, particularly as he was up against the jet-heeled Mykhailo Mudryk. He repeatedly shut the door in his opponent’s face even after he gave him a head start in footraces.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/09/ukraine-england-euro-2024-qualifier-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Three sisters convene to say goodbye to their dying father in a detailed and intimate yet uneven drama</p><p>For better and for worse, the pandemic begat a certain micro-genre of intimate drama, one defined by its smallness – tight cast, single location, no extras, minimal costumes. His Three Daughters, the latest from the film-maker Azazel Jacobs, feels like a Covid movie. The action is confined to one Manhattan apartment, to which three sisters, played by Carrie Coon, Natasha Lyonne and Elizabeth Olsen, return to settle the affairs of their dying father (Jay O Sanders) and say goodbye. The sisters almost entirely pick at the film’s knot of grief, resentment, relief and tricky love; their relationships are, for reasons that trickle out over several days, fraught and frosty. The ensemble players include two hospice nurses, one sister’s hookup and a neighbor.</p><p>Not that this is a bad thing; death, especially of the slow and managed kind, is claustrophobic. Jacobs gamely capture

Britons should learn to love onshore renewables as part of a long tradition of robust, practical, rural structures<p>Growing up in the countryside, it was a feature of drives with my parents that electricity pylons would be deplored. So I am familiar with the instinct to oppose wind turbines, which like pylons are large, energy-providing infrastructure, among some country dwellers, leading David Cameron to tighten up rules in 2015 in a way that led to a 97% reduction in the numbers granted planning permission.</p><p>Although the current government has just <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/06/first-edition-windfarms-green-policy-conservative-party" title="">announced an easing of these rules</a>, they still give plenty of power to objectors.

They are prettier than power stations, less destructive than fracking, certainly lovelier than floods, fires, droughts and oth

This Dutch apartment started life as a storage space, but a touch of toy design transformed it into a live/work eyrie<p>Naomi Russell may not be an interior designer, but she has precise views about how her Amsterdam home should look. The “perfectly done space that feels like a showroom” is not for her. What Russell, a theatre producer and founder of arts organisation <a href="https://espacoagora.space/" title="">Espaço Agora</a> prefers is a gentle fusion of past and present. It is the approach she applied to her ingenious live-work eyrie. Set on the top floor of a slender 19th-century townhouse, streamlined furnishings and vivacious paint colours are clasped by soaring golden beams so that, as she puts it: “The provenance of the architecture shines through.”</p><p>Like most of Amsterdam’s pre-20th century houses, the apartment originally served as a storage space for household clutter.

<p>New genetic research has reignited the controversy over which type of creature was the first to branch off the evolutionary tree from the common ancestor of all animals</p><p>While life on Earth has flourished for billions of years, much of it has been single-celled and microscopic. None of the first organisms had brains, or even neurons (nerve cells). None of them could “think”. The first animals to evolve were also brainless: harnessing hormones or other chemicals, rather than neurons, to coordinate their bodies. But some soon evolved central nervous systems – and the first “thoughts” were pulsed.</p><p>For decades, biologists have assumed that this only happened once and was a one-way process. Once animals had evolved brains, why would they lose them? But in the past 15 years, evidence has accumulated that this may be wrong; that sponges and other brainless animals that exist today may be descended from brainy ancestors that lost their minds.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardia

A high-achieving child and teen, he studied at Oxford and Manchester universities and briefly trained as a banker.

Formerly a hairdressers, the Small Space in Barry, South Wales, is the tiniest commercial theatre in the UK, with a stage “no bigger than a parking space”. A cast of eight would be more likely to fit one on top of the other than standing in a row. “People always say: ‘God, it is small, isn’t it?” chuckles Blakeley. “The clue is in the name.”</p><p>As long as no one minds getting cosy, 25 people can pack into the downstairs theatre for a show of music, magic and comedy. At the Small Space, bodies adapt to fit the setting, Blakeley explains: “Elbows come in, people move differently.” Like a caravan or a barge, every inch is made use of.

But the Johnsons and the McNeils, it turned out, had much more in common than that …</p><p>In the summer of 2019, Donna Johnson spotted a special offer: 23andMe kits were half price. She and her husband, Vanner, had been thinking of getting their DNA tested to learn about their heritage and any health issues that might be related to their genes. Given the deal, Vanner thought they should buy four kits and test their sons as well as themselves. “A fun family activity. That’s how we coined it to our boys,” Vanner says.</p><p>Vanner Jr and Tim – then 14 and nearly 11 – were happy to indulge their parents. They had an idea what DNA was, Vanner says, but didn’t ask many questions. The logistics proved unexpectedly challenging: you’re not supposed to consume anything for half an hour before you produce your saliva sample, and finding a time when neither boy had eaten or drunk wasn’t easy.

He is, however, certainly working within the traditional strong, silent template of the old-school western hero.<br /><br />Holger Olsen (played by Mortensen) is a Danish immigrant to the prewar United States of the 1860s, who finds himself in San Francisco – a carpenter, rough-hewn outdoorsman and military veteran.

<p>An insightful and subtle exploration of truth in politics, prompted by constantly being confused with Naomi Wolf</p><p>Some years ago, I happened to meet a survivalist and conspiracy theorist. He told me he had weapons stashed inside the walls of his house, was ready to use them in defence of “English” women and children, and believed that the BBC was covering up a vast Muslim paedophile ring. It seems uncontroversial to describe this as a “far right” belief system. But the event that first led him to abandon his faith in liberal democracy had nothing to do with the traditional concerns of the right: it was the Iraq war. The internet and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/tommy-robinson" title="">Tommy Robinson</a> did the rest.</p><p>There is a well-known “horseshoe” theory of political sentiment, which suggests that as ideologies become more polarised along a left-right axis, so they become more alike on a liberal-authoritarian one. This was a useful prop for centrists

So, I listen, and he tells me – somewhat urgently – that he is not a nerd. Nerd-<em>presenting</em>, perhaps. Most explicitly as the creator of TV quizshows and host of BBC One’s Pointless. Absolutely not a nerd. The evidence he supplies, twitching his shoulders and tugging his jacket as if to do it up, is that he does not like superheroes. He does not like sci-fi (despite, he jokes, marrying the Doctor Who actor Ingrid Oliver), does not have “nerd hobbies”, such as chess. Correction: he did like chess, he just wasn’t “very” good.

<p>A family heads to Sicily and takes in Palermo, Catania and the circular narrow gauge railway around Mount Etna</p><p>It took the second thud to rouse me. Worried I’d slept through it, I slid up the blind to find our train pulling into the port city of Villa San Giovanni in Calabria, Italy. Not quite 6am, the last of the night’s sky was taking leave: navy clouds pulled apart before my eyes, a single neon-pink patch igniting the ridgeline of the Peloritani mountains in north-east Sicily.</p><p>As I watched the waters of the Messina Strait turn silver in the dawn light, the train jerked and we began to roll the way we’d come. Shunted back and forth, I realised the carriages were uncoupling: this was the moment I’d waited years to witness. Little legs in pink pyjamas appeared on the ladder and my five-year-old daughter climbed down from her berth. “Are we riding on the ferry yet?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/sep/09/family-rail-adventure-from-the-uk-to-sicily">

Today’s beetrooty take on the coffee theme is delicious just as it is, for use in place of pickled or steamed beetroot, but if you want to turn it into something more elaborate, slice and serve with whipped feta or burrata and balsamic vinegar.</p> <a href="https:
