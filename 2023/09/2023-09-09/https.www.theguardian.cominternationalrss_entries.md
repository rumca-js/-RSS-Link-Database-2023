<p>A grotesque and often grotesquely funny musical about twins trying to Parent Trap will prove an endurance test for many</p><p>You don’t have to be insane to inhabit the daft bizarro dimension in which the writer-stars Josh Sharp and Aaron Jackson situate the Dada-on-Horny-Goat-Weed delirium of Dicks: The Musical, but it helps. That said, you do have to have an enduring love for – or at the very least, an appreciation for the distinct tonalities of – musical theater, the petri dish that incubated this special little mutant abomination. What began as an Off-Broadway sensation titled Fucking Identical Twins enters cinemas clawing and snarling, odds-on the American entertainment industry’s most insistently and consistently strange, grotesque creation this year. And if not that, it’s a safe bet that it’s still the only one with a disembodied, talking, flying pudenda.</p><p>The particular brand of “stupid and we know it” ebullience native to the stage is an acquired taste all but guaran

<p>The American film and stage actor, renowned for her roles in the composer’s musicals, on making her West End debut in a celebration of his music</p><p>Bernadette Peters is an American singer and actor. Born in 1948 in Queens, New York, where her father worked as a delivery driver, she has appeared in numerous TV shows and films, including <em>The Muppet Show</em>, <em>Ally McBeal</em>, <em>Silent Movie</em> with Mel Brooks, <em>The Jerk</em> with Steve Martin, and <em>Annie</em>. But she is probably best known for her Emmy award-winning work on Broadway, where she has starred in, among other musicals, <em>Mack and Mabel</em>, <em>Annie</em><em> Get Your Gun</em> and <em>Hello, Dolly</em>! One of the foremost interpreters of the work of Stephen Sondheim, her association with the composer began in 1983 when she was cast as Dot in the first production of <em>Sunday in the Park </em><em>With George</em>. Later this month, Peters will make her West End debut in <em><a href="https://son

<p>A rich, dill-heavy lamb stew accompanied by waxy potatoes cooked in mushroom stock and topped with cheese</p><p>The waning of new Nordic cuisine, the ultra-modern food revolution that for a few years dominated the food scene in Scandinavia and became a global phenomenon, has proved to be a blessing for Norwegian cooking. Gone is the reliance on foam, tweezers and fermented pine kernels, and in their place is an increased interest in local ingredients and in more hearty, traditional dishes. One such dish that always resurfaces in my kitchen at this time of year is my grandmother’s lamb fricassee. To better appreciate the fine, gamey flavour nuances of lamb, especially from animals raised on a diet of wild mountain herbs in polar or near-polar conditions, I like to pair it with that mild and sweet arch-Scandi herb, dill. The word “dill” originally means to lull, but it can also signify an obsession or infatuation, and, when it comes to this herb, I am absolutely insatiable. I like t

<p>Challenging yet achievable, crochet is an accessible hobby where little wins can quickly add up to something bigger</p><p>A little corner of my heart has always warmed at the sight of a granny square blanket, in cheery colours, slung carelessly over an armchair.

But as a child of the 80s, I’ve always thought of them with a rush of woolly nostalgia.</p><p>Crochet is one of the more accessible forms of fibre art, and the granny square is practically synonymous with it. Its popularity has hardly waned – you can spot granny square dresses everywhere from market stalls to <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/summer-dress-outfits">the pages of Vogue</a>.
