Adam Driver fighting dinosaurs with sci-fi weapons sounds like a surefire concept that’s guaranteed to be entertaining. But somehow, when 65 hit theatres, critics weren’t impressed and audiences weren’t present.

65 definitely raises some questions. Like why did they insist on spelling out this concept so much and ridding it of any mystery? Why do these aliens look, sound, move and measure things exactly like us? Why are all these dinosaurs so angry at these humans? What are the odds of them landing on Earth like a day before the asteroid hits?

To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to 65!
