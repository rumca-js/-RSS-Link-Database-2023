Except, if more of his players join Kevin De Bruyne, Bernardo Silva, Jack Grealish, John Stones and Mateo Kovacic in the treatment room, then Guardiola may have to pray to the medical gods for succour. De Bruyne is out until next year, yet though Guardiola suggested after Tuesday’s victory that only Kovacic has a chance of returning for Nottingham Forest’s visit, there is hope for Grealish, too. Whatever the final medical bulletins, Guardiola still has the fit Matheus Nunes, Phil Foden, Kalvin Phillips (remember him?) and Rico Lewis, who ca

<p>Jason Statham is the only bit of genuine oomph in a tired tale whose digital effects could have been shot on an iPhone</p><p>There is room for debate about whether the number 4 in EXPEND4BLES – as the title is rendered on the poster – looks sufficiently like the letter A. Next time, it will be easier with EXPENDABLE5, then three movies later it should be EXPENDA8LES, and for the 50th film they can go for a classy Roman numeral to please the classicists: EXPENDABLES.</p><p>Anyway, the lumbering giants of yesteryear action-movie product are back, although given how long they have been around, the avowedly retro nature of their style is less important and has perhaps vanished altogether. Sylvester Stallone returns as the team’s leader, Barney Ross, wreathed in bonhomie and cigar smoke but with a limited presence, rather like the constitutional monarch of the Expend4bles, with his effective prime minister being Lee Christmas, played once more by Jason Statham.

But given the journey they and their supporters have been on to get here over the last decade, De Zerbi will know all is not lost just yet.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/21/ponce-ruins-brightons-european-debut-to-snatch-victory-for-aek-athens">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Some say he’s sold out, but others may feel the Hollywood star’s advertising career is the perfect way to preserve his legacy</p><p>Few actors alive have starred in as many iconic movies as Robert De Niro. As such, the man can offer us several lessons on the value of legacy. After all, if you’ve spent the last half-decade as the public image of some of the most celebrated cultural moments, how do you reconcile that as a person? Do you keep working, even though you risk diluting the power of your best work? Do you retire, professionally a legend but potentially personally unfulfilled? It’s a quandary.</p><p>But perhaps Robert De Niro has found the perfect third way. Here is an 80-year-old man who has discovered the ideal method to keep acting while reminding the world of the power of his most visceral characters: adverts.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/sep/21/why-de-niro-as-an-80-year-old-cabbie-unsure-if-youre-talking-to-him-is-advert-gold">Continue reading...<
