The Chinese government recently banned government officials from using Apple's iPhones at work. The latest news shows that Huawei's new phones allegedly use chips made by SK Hynix, a South Korean chipmaker. In addition, the U.S. Department of Commerce has launched an investigation into Huawei's new phones. -
Without a press conference or any advertising, Huawei's new handset was sold in a low-profile manner, with no details of its parts, and released only a limited number of units. It created a mysterious atmosphere and felt like a well-orchestrated promotional campaign.
