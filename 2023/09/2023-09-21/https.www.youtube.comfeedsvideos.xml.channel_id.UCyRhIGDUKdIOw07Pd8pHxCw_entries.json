It\u2019s Amun-Re this time - the 2003 Nile-Em\u2019-Up that features \u201cPyramids\u201d, \u201cPoints\u201d, and \u201cPeculiarly Long Acrostic Poems\u201d! The boys also take a minute to talk about the expansions provided by Alley Cat Games in this new 20th Anniversary Edition, as well casting their critical eye over the recent 25th Century Games reprint of Ra. It\u2019s a good one!
