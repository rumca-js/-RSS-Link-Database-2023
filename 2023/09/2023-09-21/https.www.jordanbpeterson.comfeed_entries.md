<p>Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and econometrician Peter Arcidiacono discuss the recent landmark decision by the Supreme Court to end Affirmative Action, how his research was instrumental in that outcome, why merit is repeatedly proven to be the best indicator of success, how compassion is used to cloak racial discrimination, and what might actually yield results in service to the under-resourced communities across the United States.</p>
