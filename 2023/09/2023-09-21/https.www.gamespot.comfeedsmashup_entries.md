<p dir="ltr"><em>Editor's Note: Pokemon Scarlet and Violet's expansion comes in two parts and can't be purchased individually. Because of this, we've decided to share our impressions of Part One and will update it with a full review of The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero when both parts are available. The score attached to this review is subject to change based on this.</em></p><p dir="ltr">The fan reception to Scarlet and Violet's launch varied wildly within the community. Every Pokemon fan seems to know what's best for the series, and they were happy to share their opinions on Scarlet and Violet with anyone who would listen. Some fans decried the bugs, the struggling frame rate, and other technical problems, while others appreciated the new mechanics, open world, and story enough to make peace with these issues. Whichever side you fell on, the community was split as always.However, the further we get away from release, the more the community cools off. And those who've stuck around fo

<p>A new, cozy-themed Lord of the Rings game is on the way from Wētā Workshop and Private Division. Details are currently scant, but the game does center on everyone's favorite hairy-footed, hole-dwelling, second-breakfast-eating creatures.</p><p>The game's called Tales Of The Shire and was revealed via a brief teaser trailer showing some art work and a logo treatment. The teaser shows a woman watercoloring a picture of a hobbit, on a desk cluttered with tools, artwork, and various plants. She stops watercoloring and leaves the frame. She opens a door off-screen, letting in a breeze, light, and the sounds of children laughing and birds singing. The wind flips the pages of the book, showing more artwork of hobbits and hobbit holes, before it closes and shows the game's logo.</p><div>          </div><p>What the game actually is is up to speculation, but it's easy to imagine a Story of Seasons/Stardew Valley style farming sim is on the horizon.

<p dir="ltr">The Expendables franchise is out of step with the present. These movies are supposed to serve as homages to the silly, low-rent action movies of the '80s and '90s, when many of our biggest action stars made their names. But if this franchise wanted to keep going after a nine-year break, Expendables 4 (officially dubbed Expend4bles) needed a meaningful change to how it operates--something akin to how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/bad-boys-for-life-review-the-franchises-best-movie/1900-6417389/">Bad Boys for Life</a> added a welcome streak of self-awareness.</p><p dir="ltr">Amusingly, Expendables 4 borrows a number of elements from that third Bad Boys movie--like casting the actor who played that film's sub-villain, Jacob Scipio; an "old guy needs glasses" subplot with Dolph Lundgren; the addition of an entire group of younger-generation folks to contrast with the old hats; and a fighter who doesn't want to do any fighting because it's traumatic for him.

<p>In a new patch, Destiny 2 fixed up its immense, game-breaking bugs involving weapons crafting, paving the way for a new raid and multiplayer content.</p><p>Last weekend was a rough one for Destiny 2 developer Bungie, as players discovered (and took advantage of) some pretty substantial <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-just-had-its-most-busted-weekend-ever-but-fixes-are-rolling-out/1100-6517786/">weapon crafting exploits</a>. These errors let players add Exotic perks to crafted Legendary weapons resulting in high-powered absurdity. In response, Bungie released a hotfix that disabled all crafted weapons from being equipped at all. With the new update, "illegitimate" frames and perks on crafted weapons will be replaced and any attempt to craft "out-of-bounds" weapon will kick players back to the log in screen.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">UPDATE: With the 7.2.0.4 update tomorrow, weapon crafting will largely go back to expe

<p>Baldur's Gate 3's Astarion voice actor Neil Newbon claimed on a livestream that there is an approximately two-hour section of the game that no one has found yet.</p><p>Newborn said this on one of his regular livestreams on August 31. However, he revealed no details about what the area is and where one could find it. "There's even something I know about that you can't get to unless you do something that I don't think anyone's going to work out," he said. "I was told this in confidence and I think I'm one of the few people who knows about it as well."</p><div>          </div><p>It's also unknown if it involves Astarion, as Newbon refused to clarify. As of writing, the livestream was a few weeks ago, so it's possible that someone has found it since and either hasn't uploaded the footage or that it hasn't hit the broader community.

<p>Destiny 2: The Final Shape is adding several new Supers and Aspects when it launches in February 2024, and each one has a distinct theme behind its design. These were briefly teased by Bungie in the first deep dive into The Final Shape, and if you've been looking to see how these new additions to the game operate, several new videos have been uploaded by the studio.</p><p>It's worth noting that the videos below are from alpha playtest sessions, so things will naturally change before this expansion arrives next year, but for now, they offer a terrific look at just how versatile and teamwork-orientated these new Supers are. In case you missed them when they were first revealed, Twilight Arsenal is a Void Super for Titans that can help shred through opponents. Not only does a Titan summon three Void axes that pull enemies in and explode, these melee weapons can be picked up by fireteam members and chop weakened enemies down to size.</p><div>          </div><p>The new Void Aspect for

<p>Patch 3 for Baldur's Gate 3 is landing Friday, September 22. Among other big changes, Patch 3 will add a magic mirror in your camp to let you customize your character's appearance post-character creation.</p><p>So far Larian has been tight-lipped about what exactly to expect for the patch. General performance and bug fixes are to be expected, especially for the game's expansive and sometimes unwieldy third act. As for the magic mirror, it will let you change your character's voice, appearance, and pronouns. Your race and body type cannot be altered. You also can't change the appearance of origin characters.</p><p>More details of the patch's content will come at launch. The patch was previously announced for September 21, but had to undergo more QA testing so Larian pushed the date back. An issue is also currently plaguing the PS5 version specifically, causing the game client to crash if the console is connected to the internet. Larian is investigating the issue, but the workaround

<p>Through more than five years, many <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sea-of-thieves/">Sea of Thieves</a> players have requested one feature above all others: PvE servers, in which players wouldn't have to worry about coming upon other swashbucklers who might steal their loot, sink their ship, or otherwise get in the way. Rare has been adamant that the shared world PvPvE setup is key to the magic of its pirate sandbox game. But now, the studio is finally introducing PvE servers as a feature coming to the game this December during Season 10.</p><p>PvE servers, referred to in the menus as Safer Seas, will be a new play to play Sea of Thieves with up to three chosen friends free of the dangers (and delights) that come with PvP.

<p>Most of the time, Star Wars has a pretty simplistic view on things. Everything is binary--heroes and villains, light side and dark side, selflessness vs. selfishness, etc--with no room for nuance or meaningful ideological exploration.

Like I said, this is arcade football, so you ought to expect some cartoonish chaos, right?</p><p>The game is played with teams of seven, and fantasy squads can be built from a roster of "hundreds" of current athletes.
