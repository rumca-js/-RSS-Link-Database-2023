<p><span>

I live in Ward 5 in Somerville, where there are two candidates running
for city council this fall: </span>

<a href="https://www.jackforsomerville.com/">Jack Perenick</a> and 

<a href="https://www.naimaforsomerville.org/">Naima Sait</a>. On Sunday
both of them stopped by our neighborhood block party, and we got a
chance to talk.  As in 

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/somerville-election-thoughts">2021</a>, the 

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/apartment_prices/#2023-09-18&amp;2">high
cost</a> of housing continues to be my primary concern for Somerville,
and I asked them both what their views were.



<p>

It was clear that they both care deeply about resolving the housing
crisis, and seemed like they would prioritize trying to improve the
situation, but when we got into the details there were clear differences.

I talked to Jack first, and he told me he was strongly in favor of
upzoning, especially along the major streets, in the squares, and
around transit
