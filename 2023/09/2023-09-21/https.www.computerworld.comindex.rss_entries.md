<p>Mac adoption in the enterprise isn’t just about giving employees hardware options, according to Cisco CIO Fletcher Previn. It's a business imperative — and <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3705613/three-quarters-of-large-us-firms-now-using-more-apple-devices-survey.html">many companies agree</a>.</p><p>Previn spoke at this week's <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3706896/jamf-touts-jamf-pro-11-at-jnuc-its-annual-apple-it-admin-event.html">Jamf Nation User Conference</a> (JNUC), where he explained that migrating to Apple hardware boosts productivity, enhances security, and can trim ownership costs.
