That’s in contrast to&#160;every other developed country, which saw a decline.

Almost everyone I’ve seen talking about this new Insider article about how Elon had a special layoff just of trust and safety employees has shared it with the line “wait, there are still trust &#38; safety employees?” Elon Musk recently laid off more Twitter employees working on the platform&#8217;s trust and safety efforts, roles typically [&#8230;]

Four years ago, Techdirt wrote about iBorderCtrl, a research project funded by the EU under the Horizon 2020 framework. According to the project’s Web site: iBorderCtrl provides a unified solution with aim to speed up the border crossing at the EU external borders and at the same time enhance the security and confidence regarding border [&#8230;]

So, for all of the nonsense about what level of coercive power governments have over social media companies, it’s bizarre how little attention has been paid to the fact that TikTok is apparently proposing to give the US government control over its content moderation setup, and the US government is looking at it seriously. As [&#8230;]

The First Amendment doesn&#8217;t just protect what you say. It also protects your right to hear what others say. It guarantees a right to published information. It protects a whole lot of stuff certain politicians sincerely wish it didn&#8217;t because it gets in the way of pushing their bigoted ideals. Right now, there&#8217;s a wave [&#8230;]

Apple has never looked too kindly upon users actually repairing their own devices, or using lower cost independent repair services. The company’s ham-fisted efforts to shut down, sue, or otherwise imperil third-party repair shops are&#160;legendary.
