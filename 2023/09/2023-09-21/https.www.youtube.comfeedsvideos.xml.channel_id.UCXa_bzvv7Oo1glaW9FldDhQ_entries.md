It's been a pretty year for fighting games, and NetherRealm Studios' Mortal Kombat 1 is another worthy addition to the list. There is much to enjoy here, from the new campaign mode and deep roster to mechanics like Kameo Fighters and stunning visuals.

Quality-of-life features like customizing a character's appearance before a fight, tagging moves on-screen, and more are missing.

Here are ten things players dislike about Mortal Kombat 1, which hopefully will be improved in the coming months with new updates.
