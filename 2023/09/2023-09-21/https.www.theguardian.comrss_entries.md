<p>There’s a meaty discussion about whether the artist is guilty of cultural appropriation. But this documentary suffers from a lack of a presenter to hold it together</p><p>Whether one can separate art from the artist is a debate that will run for ever, but with Pablo Picasso there is little point in having it. The man himself said his work told you everything about him – and the work is mercurial, confrontational, twisted and violent. Picasso: The Beauty and the Beast, a three-part documentary marking 50 years since his death, confirms that the tumult on the canvas mirrored the painter’s temperament.</p><p>The tale begins with Picasso’s arrival in Barcelona at 14. He formed a fraternity of wannabe artists who were interested in painting, women and painting women. Sketching nudes was fun, but interactions with unmarried women were forbidden on religious grounds, so Picasso acquainted himself with the refuge that would inform his work for decades to come: the brothel.

The man who set out to restore the tattered fragments of his party’s reputation for responsibility – wrecked by his two predecessors – has added himself to this list of the most dishonourable, self-interested prime ministers in living memory.

<p>Until now, women here have struggled to be heard on harassment and abuse. But two controversies in popular culture are changing that</p><p>Have you ever dated a German man who happened to be a writer? No? Good for you. Not that I would recommend dating writers in general, who have a tendency to justify their worst behaviour as art. And honestly, why wouldn’t they? The canon is full of men who poured their raw misogyny into beautiful sentences and well-crafted compositions. In return some of these men had genius status conferred on them because, well, they wrote fiction and the misogyny was the fictional character’s, not theirs.</p><p>In German writing there is another unfortunate tradition: a hyperfixation on the inner world of the perpetrator. This focus goes beyond narrative perspective. It finds its way into essays and nonfiction writing. It finds its way into so many forms of writing that the perpetrator is sometimes transformed into the real victim of his own violence. That’s

The first is whether the hard-right members of his caucus will vote for the short-term funding measure necessary to stop the federal government from running out of money. The second is if whatever bill they pass will include the Ukraine aid and

Lustful gods chase her. Huntsmen stalk her. Sly wolves nip at her heels. She rushes into the arms of forbidden lovers, and away from unworthy suitors. She runs through First Nations’ creation fables and Greek myths and Grimms’ fairytales. She runs across our screens as slasher bait.

Hardcore fans may feel better served by the deep dive into Santana’s childhood and youth in Mexico, followed by his breakthrough into the San Francisco psychedelic music scene, and then on to that career-making performance at Woodstock in 1969. Forgive me if you have heard this one before, but Santana supposedly dropped acid given to him by Jerry Garcia from the Grateful Dead, expecting he would have hours to come down before his band, named after him, had to go on and play. Instead, they were called on stage soon after. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaaT_HRb4GU&amp;ab_channel=GuitarDocs"

<p>When claims such as those facing Russell Brand occur, women I know try to imagine a relationship with a 16-year-old boy – and recoil</p><p>Political change often follows a change in consciousness; the process of defamiliarisation through which things we once accepted as fine, or hated but believed were immutable, gain sufficient criticism as to become suddenly absurd. There is nothing like the shock registered by young children today when apprised of banished norms of the recent past – smoking on planes, women needing a man to co-sign for a credit card – to remind us how quickly universal assumptions can change. Among the list of gross things that, at present, still induce widespread shrugs are relationships between adult men and teenage girls. You wonder what it would take to make that taboo, too.</p><p>Calls for new laws around the age of consent in the UK, which is set at 16, came this week in the wake of the Russell Brand revelations, and were made in the first instance by one

<p><strong>Curve, Leicester<br /></strong>This staging of Kafka’s story is physically exciting, even tireless, but it hits an early peak of terror then has nowhere to go for two hours</p><p>It is linguistically playful, politically needling and gives the actors long speeches to sink their teeth into.

It is more poetic than dramatic.</p><p>The playwright is initially drawn to the theme of transformation. Where Gregor Samsa (Felipe Pacheco) is a fabric salesman, offering his customers reinvention through fashion, his sister Grete (Hannah Sinclair Robinson) is transitioning through adolescence, trying out catwalk poses and playing with her appearance. It is a fertile idea in a story about a man who turns into an insect, but one Sissay

<p>There’s a Nabokovian intrigue to this thrilling tale of a composer and her grandson with the same mysterious gift </p><p>“The spiral is a spiritualised circle,” wrote Vladimir Nabokov in his autobiography Speak, Memory. “In the spiral form, the circle, uncoiled, has ceased to be vicious; it has been set free.” Patterns – their beauty, individuality, ubiquity – lay at the heart of Nabokov’s work, but he was perhaps more interested, obsessed even, by how they could be broken, knocked out of sequence, and in the artistic fruits these ruptures could yield. “I like to fold my magic carpet, after use, in such a way as to superimpose one part of the pattern upon another,” he adds. “This is ecstasy, and behind the ecstasy is something else, which is hard to explain.” In simpler terms, experimentation, modification, variation – this is the path to a higher place.</p><p>Ecstasy is a word I’d happily associate with Patrick Langley’s lyrical and looping novel The Variations, a work with a sim

He is married to art collector Hélène (Delpy) and they live in a handsome country estate with extensive grounds and a lake.

The damage done to their family – and so many others like them – was incalculable</p><p>Huda Dahbour was 35 years old when she moved with her husband and three children to the West Bank in September 1995. It was the second anniversary of the Oslo accords, which established pockets of Palestinian self-government in the occupied territories. Jerusalem was still relatively open when they arrived in East Sawahre, a neighbourhood just outside the areas of Jerusalem that Israel had annexed in 1967. Huda was able to send her children to school within the city. They were under the age of 12, and Israel allowed them to enter without a special blue ID. But over time the restrictions grew, and from one day to the next Jerusalem was closed off to Palestinians by checkpoints, roadblocks and a tightening of the ever-more elaborate permit regime. On one occasion, the school bus was blocked
