Creator Robert Kirkman isn’t shy when it comes to prolonging his televised shows for fans to enjoy them for years to come. After all, he created the comic that launched  the Walking Dead franchise, which included the flagship AMC series that lasted over a decade, plus several spinoffs and a pile of video games. #Invincible has 144 comics under its belt, so is it possible for Robert Kirkman to pull out 8 seasons? Well, let’s all just focus on Invincible season 2 for now. Looks like the showrunner of the Netflix series Daredevil isn’t too happy with what Disney is doing over there on Disney Plus with its new show, Daredevil: Born Again. Plus we’re catching up with everybody’s favorite Belter, Camina Drummer presented by The Expanse .

In today's Daily Fix:

Ubisoft dropped big news today that a third Division game is in the works. Unfortunately there's no gameplay or even a cinematic teaser, just a press release. The release date is sometime in 2024, and hopefully they'll address the criticisms fans had for the second game. In other news, the Xbox Game Pass library is about to get bigger, with several new (and not so new) titles coming soon. Two Like a Dragon games will hit the service, along with the cozy-looking Mineko's Night Market, the next Forza Motorsport, the original Phoenix Wright Trilogy, and more.

Think you've seen the worst that Mortal Kombat 1 on the Nintendo Switch has to offer? Think again! Here's a collection of the funniest bugs and glitches from the Switch port of MK1.

While we gave Mortal Kombat 1 on the PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC an 8, we unfortunately had to give the Nintendo Switch version a 3 because of the state the game is currently in. Thankfully, some joy can be pulled from the sorrow as we've gathered many of the worst and weirdest things to come out of this port of the game. Mortal Kombat 1 is a soft reboot of the MK series timeline, but many favorites, including Liu Kang, Scorpion, Sub Zero, and even Reptile all return for this new entry. MK1 also features the kameo system, a way to bring in classic characters as assists.

Thanks to Baconsaur of Astora (@mr_baconssauro on Twitter) for finding the hilarious Shang Tsung glitch, and @sunset8961 on YouTube for clueing me in to the joy of Cyrax's fatality.

Cyberpunk has come a long way in the nearly three years since it launched, and nothing exemplifies that more than the brand new 2.0 update for the game, releasing just before the Phantom Liberty expansion. CD Project Red are continuing their tradition of providing free content updates by pushing this 2.0 gameplay update to all players who own the game and not just Phantom Liberty owners, so whether you’re planning to get the new expansion or you’re diving into the base game for the first time, here’s Everything New in Cyberpunk 2077’s Free 2.0 Update.

One final note before we get started, while this 2.0 update is free for players who own the game, the update is not being pushed to all consoles. PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC will see this update, while PS4 and Xbox One users will not.

Dumb Money also stars Pete Davidson, Vincent D’Onofrio, America Ferrera, Nick Offerman, Anthony Ramos, Sebastian Stan, Shailene Woodley and Seth Rogen. Directed by Craig Gillespie, written by Lauren Schuker Blum & Rebecca Angelo, based on the book “The Antisocial Network” by Ben Mezrich.

Final Fantasy 7 Remake followed the structure of the original nearly to a tee, while also making small but significant changes to key moments. Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth has the unenviable task of picking up this new, almost-but-not-quite-same story as Cloud, Aerith, Tifa, Barret, and Red XIII emerge from Midgar on the heels of Sephiroth. 

We went hands-on with a short demo section of the PS5 exclusive, playing through a bit of the flashback sequence from five years previous where Cloud and Sephiroth approach the Mt. Nibel reactor, as well as a second section of the open area that the party explores before entering the military city of Junon. Here's what we thought.
