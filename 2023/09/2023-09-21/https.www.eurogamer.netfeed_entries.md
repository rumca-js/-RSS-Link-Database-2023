Ubisoft sure does love a sequel, and it's now confirmed - in just about as understated a fashion as is possible - that it's got another one in the works, this time in the form of The Division 3.
</p><p>
News of The Division 3's existence comes not via a flashy announcement trailer or Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot bellowing the news through a megaphone while sat astride a glitter cannon, but instead tucked away in a press release announcing something else entirely.
</p><p>
Specifically, Ubisoft today disseminated a press release among news outlets announcing that Julian Gerighty - the creative director of next year's eagerly anticipated Star Wars Outlaws - has been appointed new executive producer of its Tom Clancy's The Division brand.

Seeing everything there is to see in developer Larian Studios' ludicrously vast Baldur's Gate 3 is already something of an impossible task, but Astarion actor Neil Newbon has now raised the stakes even higher, claiming it features a two-hour secret section that no-one's yet found.
</p><p>
During one of Newbon's regular Twitch livestreams, aired at the end of last month (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/astarion-actor-says-baldurs-gate-3-players-havent-found-a-hidden-2-hour-section-im-one-of-the-few-people-that-knows-about-it/">thanks GamesRadar</a>), the voice of everyone's favourite perfectly coiffured glampire teased that, "There's even something I know about that you can't get to unless you do something that I don't think anyone's going to work out".

Sadly, Newbon - who was told about the mysterious "two hours of content" i

As part of its Tokyo Game Showcase, Capcom has shared nine minutes of new Dragon's Dogma 2 gameplay footage, this time focusing on vocations - basically the series' version of classes - as well as offering a little look at some of the major locations in its world.
</p><p>
At the game's outset, Dragon's Dogma 2 provides a choice between four starting vocations: fighter, mage, thief, and archer. Don't expect to be locked into this initial style of play forever, though; more vocations will become available as events progress - and vocations can be changed by visiting Vocation Guilds, should you want to mix things up.
</p><p>
As far as starter vocations go, however, the fighter specialises in one-handed sword and shield combat for short-range attacks and defensive manoeuvring. The archer, meanwhile, is bett

Five and a half years and endless requests from the community later, Rare has announced it'll finally be adding private servers to Sea of Thieves - meaning a single crew of up to four players can explore the world without fear of PvP encounters - starting this December, as part of the multiplayer pirate adventure's Season 10.
</p><p>
Season 10 itself gets underway on 19th October, and will introduce a major new feature each month ahead of 2024 - essentially meaning all content originally planned for 2023 will arrive before the end of the year, despite a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-season-10-release-delayed-into-october">painfully protracted, seven-month-long Season 9</a>.

Capcom has shared more on Exoprimal's second season.
</p><p>
As part of the studio's Tokyo Game Show presentation, Capcom revealedthe second season of its mech-tastic dino shooter will be going live on 18th October. Players can expect a variety of additions on this date, including a new map known as Ocean Platform. 
</p><p>
This offshore oil plant has been converted into a Hi-Xol synthesis facility, with Capcom says will boast "precarious pathways" and a lot of "verticality" for players to negotiate.

The Crew Motorfest takes place in Hawaii. After two games set across a crunched-down United States, the developer, Ubisoft Ivory Tower, has given up trying to drive a whole country and settled on a small island. It's like trading in a stretch Hummer and going for a cool little convertible hatchback. The result is a breeze - a tour of tapered-down Oʻahu, a decent facsimile of Forza Horizon, and a dose of thought-free driving. Every turn is a chance to squeeze the hand-brake; so grippy and slippy are the corners, kicking up clouds of rubbery smoke, it's as if someone had crept out and sprayed every bend with glue. The only thing that may cause you to come unstuck is if you have any niggling desires to play something new, challenging, deep, substantial, surprising, or innovative. But those desires are, on occasion, better o

Monster Hunter Now, the latest free-to-play Pok&eacute;mon Go-style augmented reality creature-battler from developer Niantic, made in collaboration with Capcom, has officially surpassed 5m downloads in its first week of release on iOS and Android.

Monster Hunter Now, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-developer-announces-monster-hunter-now">announced back in February</a> and got its full launch on 21st September following a series of closed beta tests, employs a similar real-world exploration and interaction system to the ones seen in the likes of Niantic's Pok&eacute;mon Go and Pikmin Bloom, albeit with an obvious Monster Hunter twist.

Here, players are able to gather useful resources and fight monsters they encounter while out on their real-world travels - including the Barroth, Tobi Kada

</p><p>
This closed alpha will be accessible to players who sign up for an account at <a href="https://www.everywhere.game/">Everywhere.game</a>.
</p><p>
A new trailer for Everywhere, released today, shows some of the biomes you can explore and play around with in the game, as well as some swooping camera pans through its Ready Player One-style hub. There's also a glimpse at some of the types of mini-games you can build and a brief look at the game's editor mode, which lets you tweak creations you've made on the fly.

As part of this morning's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/octopath-traveler-2-headed-to-xbox-next-year">Xbox Digital Broadcast at Tokyo Game Show</a>, we got our first look at Hotel Barcelona. 
</p><p>
This upcoming release is a time-looping action game from Hidetaka "Swery" Suehiro and Goichi "Suda51" Suda, two legends of game development. It promises to serve us all up some "2.5D slasher film parodic action".
</p><p>
So, what's it actually all about? Well, Hotel Barcelona is where America's serial killers have all decided to reconvene. And, according to the official trailer blurb, players will need to defeat this murderous bunch and "check out before all the blood is spilled". </p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-hotel-barcelona-a-horror-themed-side-scroller-from-swery-and-suda51">Read more

Party Animals, previously one of the most wishlisted games on Steam, has come under fire since its release earlier this week, with scores of players calling out developer Recreate Games for what they say was false advertising. 
</p><p>
This all stems from the game's description of its offline (and online) multiplayer, which originally read: "Paw it out with your friends both online and offline".
</p><p>
But Party Animals does not have an offline mode. As a result, many owners have left negative comments about the release.

It Has Begun... Again. 30 years on from furrowing the brows of parents and bothering the halls of the Senate, NetherRealm Studios has returned with Mortal Kombat 1, a full re-roll on the mammoth universe and bloodthirsty roster of kombatants that dwell within.
</p><p>
Mortal Kombat 1 - not to be confused with video games Mortal Kombat (1992) or Mortal Kombat (2011) or movies Mortal Kombat (1995) or Mortal Kombat (2021) - sees the timeline reset, following the outcome of Mortal Kombat 11 and hero Liu Kang's battle with reality-warping Elder God, Kronika.</p><p>In the aftermath of Kang's victory, the former Shaolin monk found himself bestowed with the power of time, affording him the opportunity to restart history and reshape the realms of the universe, in an effort to ensure a timeline that dials back on the violence, chaos,

One such game was Baldur's Gate 3, the recent hit from developer Larian.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 will include scenes reminiscent of the franchise's infamous No Russian mission, where armed terrorists murder scores of people in a civilian setting.
</p><p>
A description of the game's most violent moments has now been published by the <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39547/call-of-dutyr-modern-warfarer-iii/">ESRB</a>, the US ratings board, which has given Modern Warfare 3 an M rating for Mature.

"A handful of sequences depict more intense acts of violence," the ESRB writes, including a mission which includes "terrorists (dressed as police officers and paramedics) shooting/killing fleeing civilians inside a stadium concourse".

Everything seemed to be going well until the President of the United States crash landed in front of me. Only an hour earlier I had snuck through the mile-high walls of the new district of Dogtown and suddenly I found myself battling through hordes of faceless goons to protect POTUS and escort her to safety. Together we fought flocks of drones and a giant robot, stopped to investigate a ruined museum, and then paused to secure a safehouse and recruit a spymaster played by Idris Elba.
</p><p>
Once again, CD Projekt RED shows how an expansion should be done. Phantom Liberty slots seamlessly into Cyberpunk 2077, introducing new characters, new stories and a vibrant new district to explore. This arrives alongside a comprehensive, free suite of updates that overhaul the game's skill trees and cybernetic augmentations,
