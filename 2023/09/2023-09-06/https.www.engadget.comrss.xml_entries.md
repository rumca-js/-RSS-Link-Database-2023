<p>The home state of some of the most influential AI companies has a new plan to confront the potential regulation of generative AI. California Governor Gavin Newsom signed an <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2023/09/06/governor-newsom-signs-executive-order-to-prepare-california-for-the-progress-of-artificial-intelligence/"><ins>executive order</ins></a> instructing agencies in the state to study potential risks and use cases for the technology.</p><p>Under the order, state agencies are tasked with identifying “the most significant and beneficial uses of GenAI in the state” and creating frameworks to train state employees on how to use “state-approved” generative AI tools in their work. Likewise, it directs the same agencies to analyze potential negative impacts of the technology, including its effect on vulnerable communities and threats to “critical energy infrastructure” in the state.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The order also lays the groundwork for new partnership

<p>Today, GoPro unveils its latest camera: The Hero 12 Black. This time around, the updates are mostly on the user experience, with a slight focus on pro users and creators. Perhaps the most exciting new “feature” for regular GoPro users will be the claimed extended battery life. The company says “Up to two times” the runtime of previous cameras. Battery life has long been a pain point, so we’ll be keen to see what that looks like in real terms.</p><p>There are some new shooting modes, with 8:7 (full sensor) recording now available across the board, including TimeWarp and the Night Effect modes for the first time. Recording in 8:7 allows you to “punch out” different aspect ratio content from the same source material while maintaining a high resolution. The camera’s HDR mode has also been tuned for even better handling of mixed lighting conditions. Hypersmooth, GoPro’s in-camera stabilization is now on its sixth iteration —- but it’s been solid right from the start, so we’re intereste

<p>It's been almost exactly four years since Sonos first introduce the Move, the company's first portable speaker. The Move was a solid speaker when it was first introduced, but in the years that have passed, things like its lower-than-average battery life have made it harder to recommend. But even with the summer quickly fading, Sonos has a new portable speaker for powering autumn days outside, the Move 2. On the surface, the Move offers the same formula as the original. It's a relatively large, loud speaker that you can lug around with you; it's also quite durable, able to withstand drops, bumps, extreme temperatures, rain and snow.&nbsp;</p><p>But unsurprisingly, Sonos has taken some inspiration from the recent Era 100 and Era 300 speakers here for some improvements. The new top panel touch controls are the same as you'll find on those speakers. There's a volume slider as well as dedicated forward and back buttons. It also has a USB-C line-in jack, so you can connect the Move 2 to

<p>“We are engaged in a race against time to protect the children of our country from the dangers of AI,” the attorneys general wrote in an<a href="https://www.engadget.com/attorneys-general-from-all-50-states-urge-congress-to-help-fight-ai-generated-csam-184938825.html"> open letter to Congress</a>, asking for increased protective measures against AI-enhanced child sexual abuse images.</p><p>Using image generators like Dall-E and Midjourney to create child sexual abuse materials isn’t a problem, as the software has guardrails to stop those prompts. However, when open-source versions of the software and similar tools without guardrails or oversight arrive, it could be a major issue. Even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has stated that AI tools would benefit from government intervention to mitigate their risk.</p><p>– Mat Smith</p><p></p><p>​​<em>You can get these reports delivered daily direct to your inbox. </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em>Subscribe right here!</e

<p>Those firing up Airbnb to look for a short-term rental in New York City right now may find the pickings a bit slim. Officials in the city have <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/specialenforcement/registration-law/registration-for-hosts.page">started enforcing</a> new regulations mandating that hosts will have to file a registration application — and meet a set of requirements — to be able to rent homes to guests for less than 30 days. Hosts can only rent out homes for short-term stays if they're also staying there, and only two guests are allowed at a time. These requirements are part of old and existing rules on rentals, however, and only the Short-Term Rental Registration Law itself is new.</p><p>NYC's Office of Special Enforcement said on its website that on September 5, it started collaborating with booking platforms like Airbnb and Vrbo to ensure that they're honoring the city's verification system. These companies will now have to check whether hosts listing their homes for

<p>Google has tentatively settled with the alliance of attorneys general that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-play-store-suit-211116918.html">filed a lawsuit in 2021</a> alleging the search giant abused its dominance on Android app distribution through the Google Play store. Officials claimed Google was leveraging “its monopoly power with Android to unlawfully maintain its monopoly,” saying that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/dozens-us-states-sue-google-alleging-antitrust-violations-2021-07-07/">90 percent of all app sales</a> took place through Google Play. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-06/google-tentatively-settles-states-play-store-antitrust-suit"><em>Bloomberg reports</em></a> that the matter has been referred to a judge who, if happy, can confirm the settlement and cancel the pending courtroom battle.
