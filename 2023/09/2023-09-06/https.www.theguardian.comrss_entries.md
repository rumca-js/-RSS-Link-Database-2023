There’s an awful lot of it to get through and, with so many gaping holes in my knowledge, I need to crack on.

The first port of call for lazy TV presenters and pundits, they also provide endless hours of cheap content for sports radio stations … and tea-time football emails. In the UK, Sky Sports and TNT both employ their own in-house former referees to pass their verdicts on the verdicts of their former colleagues. Occasionally interesting but largely pointless, these conversations do little more than further fuel the flames of fan paranoia that prompted some bright TV exec to air them for those sweet, sweet engagement metrics in the first place.</p><p>On the surface <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/04/swed

<p>A decade after the conclusion of the underrated original series, Kentucky’s cowboy marshal is back and making bold new moves. The hat still fits, though …</p><p>You’ll never leave Harlan alive, says the song, but Raylan Givens managed it. The Stetson-wearing deputy, protagonist of the inexcusably overlooked crime drama Justified, made it out after six seasons of chasing outlaws through eastern Kentucky’s hills and hollers. A decade later, the hat is back. Good news: it still fits.</p><p>If you haven’t watched Justified, then you haven’t seen Timothy Olyphant in the role he was born for. First appearing in a series of Elmore Leonard novellas, Givens is the “cowboy marshal” whose Old West approach at today’s US marshals service gets him into as much trouble as his quick-draw artistry gets him out of. His long-awaited return adapts Leonard’s 1980 story, City Primeval: High Noon in Detroit, across an eight-part series that’s part continuation, part offshoot.</p><p>Justified: City Prim

<p>Steve Booth, former guitarist of scorching hot glammers Pink Grease, died before End Credits was finished. Our writer relives the Orphic odyssey that has finally brought his vision to the screen</p><p>The last time I saw Steve Booth was in September 2019, outside the Curzon cinema, where he worked, on Shaftesbury Avenue, London. We had met to talk about End Credits, a martial-arts short film we had written, and that he was due to begin shooting. But on that occasion, we barely discussed the film, drifting instead into life’s bigger business: his attempts to move out of his artists’ squat, his mum’s recent illness, my dad’s death. Moseying outside, still chatting, we agreed that art – and the struggles to make it happen – could fit in somewhere amid all of this. We just weren’t sure where. That slanted smile split his face and he gave me a hug. Then I sloped off into Soho’s bleary lights.</p><p>Just over a year later, Steve was dead, at the age of 44. He caught Covid in January 202

<p>Celine Song’s feature debut about two people whose lives intertwine again after years apart is delicate and sophisticated, but also simple and direct</p><p>This heart-meltingly romantic and sad movie from Korean-Canadian dramatist and filmmaker Celine Song left me wrung out and empty and weirdly euphoric, as if I’d lived through an 18-month affair in the course of an hour and three-quarters. How extraordinary to think that this is Song’s feature debut. It’s delicate, sophisticated and yet also somehow simple, direct, even verging on the cheesy. Past Lives has been compared to the movies of Richard Linklater, Noah Baumbach and Greta Gerwig; all true, but I also found myself remembering the wrenching final moments of Wong Kar-wai’s In the Mood for Love, with Tony Leung murmuring his pain into a stone hollow in Angkor Wat and – yes – the gooey genius of Dean Friedman’s plaintive 1978 chart hit Lucky Stars.</p><p>This is a story of lost love and childhood crush, the painful and danger

<p>A funny-peculiar first novel about a woman lurching through life that will challenge your preconceptions</p><p>Sara Pascoe’s debut novel draws you in slowly and then all at once. The first line is fairly standard. The second, a little less so. Still, if you skimmed the first chapter, it would be easy to think you knew what you were getting: your basic, by-the-numbers quirky-girl-meets-boy romcom. This is because that is exactly what our narrator wants us to think. She’s trying very hard to be basic! And she would <em>love</em> this to be a romcom. “I hope since our chat he thinks I’m normal,” she confides cheerily. “I told him I was several times.”</p><p>She is Sophie; he is Chris. They met working “on the buses” taking tourists round London; now Sophie works in a pub and Chris is buying a drink, and he doesn’t remember her at all. Or does he? Part of the joy of Weirdo<em> </em>is not knowing what to expect, or rather in having your expectations subverted by Sophie’s smoothie-make

<p>As the director nears his 11th decade, two of his films, Nothing But a Man and The Plot Against Harry are being restored; both are marvels of independent cinema</p><p>Michael Roemer, 95, is one of film’s finest chroniclers of postwar American aspiration. His debut, Nothing But a Man, won two prizes at the Venice film festival over half a century ago, using Euro-neorealism to tell the story of a working-class Black couple in Alabama. The result is a moving and unflinching depiction of the daily realities of racism, and one of the most brilliant truly independent films of all time.</p><p>Nothing But a Man, like the rest of Roemer’s filmography, refused to heed the production and aesthetic conventions of its day. “If I could have made popular films, I would have,” he says. “But I believe in something. If I betray it then I destroy myself.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/sep/06/michael-roemer-american-jewish-life-plot-against-harry">Continue reading...</a>

This was not a suggestion that “Tom” should arrive in East Sussex naked. Such a possibility was unlikely anyway since at this point the poet was still working as a buttoned-up clerk at Lloyds Bank. Eliot was famously wedded to his three-piece suit to the point where, Woolf joked, he would have worn a four-piece one if such a thing existed.

<p>Forced to drive a mysterious passenger at gunpoint, David finds himself embroiled in a confusing, high-stakes game of cat-and-mouse</p><p>If you were programming a season of the best of the worst from Nicolas Cage’s filmography – in other words, his most interesting/outlandish/crazed performances in low-budget films – this kooky thriller would certainly be a good candidate. It features an entertainingly deranged performance from Cage, who sports a helmet of bright-red hair and a maroon smoking jacket that makes him look like a leprechaun turned lounge singer, topped off with a broad Boston accent. Cage’s unnamed character crawls without invitation into the car of David (Joel Kinnaman, an excellent straight foil here), who is already late getting to the hospital where his wife is giving birth. Despite David’s protestations that he’s not a taxi or Uber, he pulls a gun on David and insists he start driving. Who would dare to say no to someone with such bright gleaming teeth?</p><p>Gi

<p>With great water sports, coastal walks, wildlife and an ice-cream parlour, this idyllic spot in Sutherland is the perfect hangout – and no one seems to know about it</p><p><br />I was weaving through an underwater forest, russet strands of seaweed billowing around me like mermaids’ hair. As we snorkelled, the water was at times shallow enough that my fins scraped the sand; at others, the kelp-smothered rocks seemed to drop away, leaving the seabed out of reach. A flicker of movement in the corner of my eye hadd me spinning around to find my guide, Rhionna, pointing to a small, crimson-red sea anemone on a dark rock, its tentacles quivering in the current.</p><p>Afterwards, we sat in the shallows and peeled off our fins, moving back and forth with the motion of the waves. A cluster of bemused campervanners were watching from above. And who could blame them? Like them, I’d never associated the North Sea – least of all far northern Scotland – with snorkelling. “How was it?” one asked

<p>Director Oscar Harding found a bizarre tape when cleaning out his late grandfather’s possessions – and discovered the loopy world of farmer Charles Carson</p><p>The film-making style of the late Charles Carson veers, undeniably, towards the creepy. A Somerset farmer with a hobby that seemed to have taken over his life, Carson had a penchant for filming cows giving birth (with closeups of the placenta). Then there’s his footage of burying his pet cat, Pandy, in the orchard. “You’d never think he was dead, would you?” Carson marvels, shoving little Pandy in front of the camera. Erm, the rigor mortis is a bit of a giveaway. Weirdest of all are the photos Carson took of his elderly mother after she died – pushing her around the farm for three days in a wheelchair so the cows could pay their last respects. A neighbour recalls bumping into the pair: “Your mum doesn’t look too well.” “No. She’s dead.”</p><p>“Dark but friendly dark,” is the verdict of one of the talking heads padding out

<p>After my mastectomy, my one-breasted body made me feel depressed. But a fleeting comment on a podcast helped renew my pride</p><p>After my mastectomy, I wore a prosthetic breast, but I felt really ashamed of my body. I didn’t want to show it to anyone. I felt mutilated. Wearing a prosthesis and removing it at night didn’t resolve the problem for me. Each night when I faced my one-breasted chest in the mirror, I thought I looked horrible. It was like living two lives, having two selves.</p><p>When I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2017, I received excellent care from the NHS and Macmillan nurses. I was given lots of information about the various prostheses I could choose, silicone breasts that you slide into your bra each morning. And later, about 18 months after the mastectomy, a surgeon explained how reconstruction would work, how they would take a part of my tummy and make a breast out of it. The surgery would take eight hours and there would be more operations to make me sy
