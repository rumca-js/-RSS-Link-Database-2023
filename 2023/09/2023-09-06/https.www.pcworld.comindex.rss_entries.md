<p><em>Starfield </em>is the game <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2057129/starfield-review-best-bethesda-game.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">everyone&rsquo;s talking about right now</a>. But unless you have an Xbox or <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1996675/starfield-these-are-the-system-requirements-ssd-is-mandatory.html">a gaming PC with some pretty decent specs</a>, you&rsquo;re left out of the conversation. Or are you? If you want to run Bethesda&rsquo;s latest sprawling RPG on an older machine or a laptop with integrated graphics, you might want to check out the &ldquo;Potato Mode&rdquo; game mod. It squishes the game&rsquo;s lovely textures down to as low as 16 bits, making it look like something that might be more at home on a PlayStation 2 than an RGB-laden PC from this decade. </p>

<p>The integrated web search in the Windows Start menu is cool, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2014130/make-windows-search-so-much-better-with-these-tricks.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">a lot more useful than you might think</a>. But like just about every other part of Windows lately, it insists on keeping you in Microsoft&rsquo;s playpen by forcing links to open in the Edge browser. That&rsquo;s about to change, at least if you live in most of continental Europe. A recent change to the developer channel indicates that links from the Start search and widgets in Windows 11 will open in the operating system&rsquo;s default browser, whatever that happens to be. </p>



<p>The change comes in an August announcement <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/08/25/announ

<p>Ads based on your browsing history are nothing new. On the contrary, it&rsquo;s a widespread and controversial phenomenon, but now Google is rolling out new tools to give you more control over ad serving in Chrome. If you&rsquo;ve recently reinstalled the browser, you may have already received a notification about this, but either way, it&rsquo;s perfectly possible to get rid of this type of persistent ads.</p>



<p>In this article, we show you how to do it. Our little mini-guide is based on the desktop version of Google&rsquo;s browser. It works pretty much the same in the mobile version of Chrome.</p>

<p>After a recent Windows 11 update, you can <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1996440/windows-11-this-new-taskbar-function-breaks-with-old-windows-tradition.html">show seconds in the taskbar</a> if desired. You could already do that in earlier versions via a registry entry, but now there&rsquo;s an official checkbox for it. </p>



<p>To do this, open the Windows Settings and go to <em>Personalization &gt; Taskbar</em>. Click on &ldquo;Taskbar behavior,&rdquo; scroll down, and check the box next to &ldquo;Show seconds in taskbar clock (consumes more power).&rdquo; </p>



<p>That message in the brackets indicates why Microsoft did not integrate the seconds display into Windows earlier: The power consumption increases (minimally) as a result. </p>

<p>What you should back up depends on how you use your PC. As a rule, a regular backup of the home directories is sufficient. This protects against data loss&mdash;for example, if an important file is accidentally deleted. With a suitable tool, you can automate the process. </p>



<p>If many programs and perhaps server services are installed, a complete backup of<strong> </strong>the hard disk is recommended from time to time. We present tools with which an image of the drive can be created and, if necessary, also restored on a new hard disk.</p>
