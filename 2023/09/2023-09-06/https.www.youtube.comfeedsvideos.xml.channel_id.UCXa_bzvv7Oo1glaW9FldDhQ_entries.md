Nearly three years after its controversial release, Cyberpunk 2077 has improved by leaps and bounds in performance and features. However, its biggest new addition arrives on September 26th for Xbox Series X/S, PS5 and PC with Phantom Liberty. It's the first and only expansion for the FPS/RPG and features a new district in Dogtown.

Players can look forward to new story quests, over 100 items (including weapons and cosmetics) and new activities like Courier Missions and Airdrops. However, several other changes are also arriving courtesy of Update 2.0, which revamps all the perks, adds vehicular combat and modding, and overhauls the police system.

It's a lot and could very well warrant a brand-new playthrough. Here are some new details about Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty before its release.
