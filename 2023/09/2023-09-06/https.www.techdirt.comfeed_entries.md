Earlier this year the White House put out a document articulating a National Cybersecurity Strategy.

We’ve covered the quixotic campaign of Stephen Thaler, who has filed lawsuits around the world arguing that he deserves to get copyrights and patents on writings and inventions created by DABUS, which Thaler claims is an AI that he created. He’s lost nearly every case as he attempts to do so, often embarrassingly, including one [&#8230;]

For someone who&#8217;s a lawyer, a former prosecutor, a former mayor, and a former presidential confidant, Rudy Giuliani sure doesn&#8217;t seem to know his way around a lawsuit. It&#8217;s perhaps that last thing on that list that&#8217;s gotten him in the most trouble. Rather than recognize the peaceful transition of power that followed the 2020 [&#8230;]

It still amazes me that KOSA has any Democratic co-sponsors, let alone 21 Democratic co-sponsors in the Senate led by lead Democratic sponsor (and embracer of any bill that will undermine the internet it it lets him ignorantly grandstand about how terrible the internet is), Senator Richard Blumenthal. This includes some big names who purport [&#8230;]
