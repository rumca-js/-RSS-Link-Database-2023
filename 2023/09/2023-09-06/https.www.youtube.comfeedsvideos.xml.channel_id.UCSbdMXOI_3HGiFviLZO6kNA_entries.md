OKAY! Some exciting news this week! We got a report about the Quest Pro line returning in the form of the Quest 4 Pro.. but I think more importantly we got an update on the Meta Quest 3 Lite. The True replacement for the Quest 2 as the entry level device AND for a crazy price. 

Plus Nintendo VR headset news a ton of amazing research and a spiritual successor to Echo Arena is on its way from the Gorilla Tag developers!

I hope you enjoyed this week of VR news! Lots of exciting stuff.
