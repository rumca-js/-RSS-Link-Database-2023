Immediately standing out with his black and yellow garb, Scorpion\u2019s command of fire also makes him one of the most fearsome fighters in the entire canon. This feature discusses his outfits, from the relatively simple vest in 1992\u2019s Mortal Kombat all the way through his heavily armored mid-phase, to a sort of return to roots look with fitted material outerwear. \n\nHis signature fatalities \u2013 as is the case with most in Mortal Kombat \u2013 lean on the gruesome, with his move set receiving significant evolution and upgrade in Mortal Kombat\u2019s most recent outings. This feature focuses on Mortal Kombat\u2019s canon entries only, so no mention of Scorpion\u2019s formidable outfit in MK vs DCU\u2026 apart from just now.\n\nCredit for Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe footage: Youtube user: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1vGIwgZlLc", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq_OsMu7ZKo", "date_published": "2023-09-01T21:15:01+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/iq_OsMu7ZKo/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Starfield - How To Be The ULTIMATE SPACE PIRATE", "description": "The level of freedom and flexibility that Starfield offers in letting players whoever they fancy themselves being in its massive interstellar setting is perhaps one of the game\u2019s biggest strengths. \n\nTo those who have familiarity with Bethesda Game Studios\u2019 past works, all of which have prided themselves on the same design philosophy, that doesn\u2019t come as a massive surprise- though it\u2019s still hard not to be impressed by how few restrictions Starfield puts on your in letting you pick a role for yourself and inhabiting it to your heart\u2019s content. \n\nThat\u2019s doubly true, in fact, if the role you want to pick is one of a space pirate. If that is what your heart desires as you begin your space-faring journey in Starfield, this guide should help you get familiar with the things you need to be familiar with in your life of star-hopping crime.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejn092DPi2g", "date_published": "2023-09-01T16:15:00+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/Ejn092DPi2g/hqdefault.jpg"}]
