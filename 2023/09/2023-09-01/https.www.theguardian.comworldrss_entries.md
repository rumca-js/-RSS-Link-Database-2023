<p>From Essex to Cumbria, many are dismayed by timing of the government’s action on aerated concrete in buildings</p><p>On Thursday, the emails that have left headteachers reeling started to arrive. A ruling from ministers in the Department for Education said their schools, built using potentially dangerous concrete, would need to close or partially close.</p><p>Within hours, parents and children had been informed. Many were left angry and confused by the timing of the announcement, just before the start of a new school year. Schools across England were left with days to improvise temporary classrooms from marquees or empty office buildings, or arrange to share space with unaffected schools. The majority of schools will open as usual but for tens of thousands of pupils the new academic year will start like no other.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/sep/01/aerated-concrete-england-schools-buildings-parents-teachers">Continue reading...</a>
