		The Philippines recently-launched eGov PH Super App aims to streamline government documents and services access. Part of the e-Gov PH system, this app provides the public convenient access to government services and information online at both the local and national levels, reports <a href="https://news.abs-cbn.com/video/business/08/29/23/egov-super-app-promises-easier-passport-applications-digital-drivers-license">ABS-CBN News</a>. The app is another step forward in President Marcos’ push to digitize government agencies.

Among its features, the AI-based app will make getting Philippine passports easier and provide a digital driver’s license, as an alternative to the traditional plastic card. The Land Transport Office said earlier this year the mobile driver’s l

		Without judging the significance or veracity of the successes that digital ID organization Worldcoin’s executives have claimed this summer, the volume seems to be keeping pace with ominent news.

<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/worldcoin">Worldcoin</a> says that 2.3 million have enrolled in its iris biometrics-secured World ID globally since the project's late-July launch. CEO Alex Blania has been out front in the marketing blitz, telling reporters that there are 1.7 million monthly active users of the company's wallet, called the World app.

Blania trumpeted this week that, for the first time, a half-million World app transactions were mediated by the software on one unspecified day.

While not an accomplishment, Worldcoin says it is placing 1,500 i

		An age-verification law in the U.S. state of Texas can't be enforced against porn sites as intended while arguments about its constitutionality are heard in court.

A preliminary junction has been placed on the gating law because it was found to violate the First Amendment of the Constitution. It is not clear what the next step in this case will be.

The contentious regulation, <a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/88R/billtext/html/HB01181H.htm">HB 1181</a>, was supposed to be law as of September 1. Its stated goal is to prevent children under the age of 18 years from accessing adult content online.

Anyone found to break the law would face daily fines of up to $10,000 of a violation. Fines can be up to an additional $250,000 if a child gets past t

		Meta made a couple significant computer vision announcements this week. It introduced a proposed fairness benchmark, and it made vision model open source.

In both cases, the parent of Facebook wants to insinuate itself deeper into fabric of AI development.

Meta has proposed FACET as the standard for image classification and semantic segmentation "at unprecedented scale." How much, if at all, Facebook benefits from this is an open question.

		The use of biometrics to identify government workers in African countries has been gaining traction over the years, and Equatorial Guinea and Ghana are the latest countries wishing to improve the efficiency of their public payrolls with the technology.

Ghana’s National Identification Authority (NIA) has declared its willingness to help the government expunge public workers who are defrauding the state of huge sums of money for little or no work done. The ID-issuing authority says this is possible with the mandatory enrollment for the Ghana Card by all public sector workers, which began on August 28. This move in Ghana comes at a time when the oil-rich central African nation of Equatorial Guinea has also launched a biometric identification d
