They savoured every moment of Kenilworth Road’s first taste of the Premier League, keeping the volume high from start to finish, and the celebrations would have been wild if Carlton Morris had taken a late chance to equalise moments before Kurt Zouma scored the goal that carried West Ham back to the top of the table.</p><p>Unfortunately for Luton their big night would end with another lesson about the harsh reality of life at the highest level. Rob Edwards’s side fought until the end, Mads Andersen’s stoppage-time header setting up a frantic finish, but they were blunt for long spells and were not ruthless enough when it mattered. West Ham, resilient and experienced, were rarely in trouble once Jarrod Bowen had given them the lead.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/01/luton-west-ham-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The decision to close schools is right, given the risks. But ministers should never have let this happen</p><p>Nick Gibb, the long-serving Conservative schools minister, is right that safety is the most important consideration when deciding whether to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/sep/01/more-english-schools-could-close-raac-crumbling-concrete-minister" title="">close school buildings</a> deemed to be dangerous. The public is all too familiar, post-Grenfell, with the horrific consequences that can follow from ignoring warnings that buildings are structurally unsound. But the announcement that more than 100 schools in England will not reopen next week, due to the possibility of concrete ceilings falling in, is enormously troubling. Not only will this last-minute decision disrupt thousands of children’s education, with knock-on effects on parents and carers, it also points to the extent of the harm caused by the Conservatives’ refusal to invest in the nation’s

The only thing missing was a cup of warm cocoa.</p><p>“I hope that you like it.

<p>It’s no surprise that Ibrahim Nash’at’s documentary lacks in-depth interviews – his subjects barely tolerate his presence as he reveals the fighters’ lack of purpose after the US withdrawal from Afghanistan </p><p>The spoils of war are a chore in this fascinating fly-on-the-wall study of the Taliban’s first year in power. Ibrahim Nash’at’s documentary is named for its principal location, a former CIA stronghold on the outskirts of Kabul, hastily abandoned and haphazardly vandalised by its previous tenants. The base contains treasures but it has been left in a state. Afghan fighters pick their way through the corridors, weighing up their surroundings, wondering just where to begin. They could be a band of hotel cleaners called in to mop up after a heavy-duty stag weekend.</p><p>Leading the band is Mawlawi Mansour, a bushy-bearded Taliban commander whose father was killed in a US airstrike. Nash’at shows him doggedly going about his duties. He stretches his legs on the newfangled tr

<p>Resolving economic and political inequality is vital if we want people to reject authoritarianism </p><p>There has been much handwringing about the retreat of democracy and the rise of authoritarianism in recent years – and for good reason. From the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, to the former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro and the former US president Donald Trump, we have a growing list of authoritarians and would-be autocrats who channel a curious form of rightwing populism. Although they promise to protect ordinary citizens and preserve longstanding national values, they pursue policies that protect the powerful and trash longstanding norms – and leave the rest of us trying to explain their appeal.</p><p>While there are many explanations, one that stands out is the growth of inequality, a problem stemming from modern neoliberal capitalism, which can also be linked in many ways to the erosion of democracy.

The process of turning those jewels into molasses is humbling, too; it’s one of devotion to preserve the goodness and magic of the pomegranate, to make it last and to help it travel. You can use the molasses in salad dressings, or in marinades for meats and seafood. Here, I’ve added some to roast figs to make a compote. The figs taste more beautiful the longer they have to rest, then, over the week, keep the compote in the fridge and use it to top granola or toast spread with curd cheese.

The waist is most often emphasised with a raised seam, or with pin tucks or ruching.

<p>Nintendo’s Shiro Mouri and Takashi Tezuka talk through Mario’s forthcoming return to 2D</p><p>When I was about eight years old, someone in the playground at school told me that if you crouched down on top of one of the colourful platforms in a certain level of Super Mario Bros 3, Mario would fall through the scenery and you would be able to run through the background of the whole stage, emerging in a secret passage at the end. I assumed they <em>must </em>be lying. Playground information about video games was supremely unreliable in the 90s, before YouTube playthroughs could show you all a game’s secrets with a single search.</p><p>But when I got home, I tried the crouching-down-on-the-platform thing anyway – and it worked. Mario ran right past the end of the level and emerged in a hidden room, where he was given a whistle that warped him to a different world. I was awestruck. I felt as if I had just found Atlantis, as if I had been bequeathed some incredible secret and it was now

<p>If Hollywood insists on revisiting this classic, don’t let it be a sleek, polished piece that takes itself seriously.

It’s not quite esoteric enough to be a 70s fantasy flick, and it lacks the polish and accompanying vapidity that tarnished so many Hollywood efforts in later decades.</p><p>It is memorable these days mainly for Christopher Lambert’s comical attempt at a Scottish accent as antihero Connor MacLeod, not to mention <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/seanconnery">Sean Connery</a>’s complete failure to even attempt pulling off a Spanish one as fellow immortal Juan Sánchez-Villalobos Ramírez.

<p>The carpet hub of Dalton, Georgia, provides an unlikely source of left-field characters in a compelling new documentary</p><p>If Dalton, Georgia, did not exist, Christopher Guest would have to invent it. As the signs in the downtown area proudly declare, the 34,000-strong city is renowned as the Carpet Capital of the World, manufacturing 90% of the functional carpeting in use on Earth. The local industry attracts some eccentric characters, none more so than Roderick James, the primary subject of the enthralling new documentary Carpet Cowboys.</p><p>A Scottish émigré comes to America with dreams of textile riches, his accent sits somewhere between his native brogue and the southern twang he adopted to match his flamboyant John Wayne getups. Among his various moneymaking schemes meant to fund a reunion with his long-distance girlfriend in the Philippines, he writes jingles for a proprietary Lego adhesive synthesized by a friend’s son.

We had three tiny bedrooms and amazing views out to sea. Rainbows came to the water’s edge, and then you’d watch them travel out. The moon lit a path across the sea. The sun rose over the water. Everything was lovely, apart from the snails in the loo.</p><p>I had a bad car accident in 2016 and bought the house with the compensation. I was raised on the Isle of Wight, but worked in London for much of my career. That was the draw of Hemsby – to get back to the sea. It was my only home, but I had to first rent a place an hour away in Suffolk, where my son was finishing his further education. My husband died in 2021, and my son and I were desperate to move into our new home.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/sep/01/experience-i-lost-my-home-to-the-sea">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The novelist and screenwriter on learning to read with dyslexia, being inspired by the great playwrights, and why she could never read Little Women again</p><p><strong>My earliest reading memory</strong><br />It was not until I was seven that a teacher began to realise I was unable to read. Nowadays it would be diagnosed as dyslexia, but at the time that was unheard of. So I was later than most children to discover a special book. And when I finally did, it was due to my grandmother listening to the radio. I woke up and heard an eerie voice crying, “Let me in.” Her bedroom was at the end of a dark corridor so, terrified, I burst into the room. It was Wuthering Heights by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/emilybronte" title="">Emily Brontë</a>.</p><p><strong>My favourite book growing up</strong><br />Louisa May Alcott’s Little Women.

He has explored the bardic connections between Taoist and druidic storytelling (on 2013’s Y Bardd Anfarwol), and the songs of Welsh Christian missionaries with the Indian musicians affected by them. But Galargan (“lament” in Welsh) sees him burrow into his national identity and history to excavate songs full of longing.</p><p>Recording in his kitchen and a cottage in the wild expanses of Mid Wales’s Elan Valley, Bonello has ploughed through the rich song collections of the late Meredydd Evans and Phyllis Kinney at the National Library of Wales, among others, then arranged the chosen tunes for voice, guitar, cello and piano, all played by him.

<p>A book that lays bare the absurd claims Brexit would reduce red tape – but leaves austerity out of the analysis</p><p>In his time as the Telegraph’s Europe editor, Peter Foster showed little of the imagination of his Brussels-based predecessor (by two decades) Boris Johnson – to his credit. Instead of fabricating stories about power-crazed Eurocrats, he specialised in detailed accounts of the inner workings of the European institutions, and especially, after June 2016, the back-and-forth of the Brexit negotiations. Despite the increasingly deranged tone of the Telegraph’s opinion pages, his unquestioned personal commitment both to finding out what was going on and to reporting on it as objectively as possible meant that he often knew what had been decided in key meetings on the Commission’s Brexit strategy before the Foreign Office or No 10.</p><p>It’s not surprising then that his book contains a wealth of detail, both about the damage done to UK businesses small and large by Brex

The Times columnist James Marriott tweeted an image of the cover featuring a quote from his review that appears to endorse the work.

Amid the cacophony of the Bronx, it was a tree-ringed oasis, blessed with rare cricket fields. But the grounds were cramped and uneven, sending the ball bouncing awry.

As of today, it has been collapsed into a streaming submenu and renamed ITVX Kids. It is only right that things should move with the times, but it is an ignoble end for one of ITV’s most enduring brands.</p><p>Introduced in 1983 as Children’s ITV, first as a slab of daily after-school programming and then as a standalone channel, CITV was always smaller and scrappier than its BBC counterpart, CBBC. But that was its charm. For years, schoolchildren could easily be identified by whether they watched CBBC or CITV at home; the former may have been better behaved, but the latter were always more fun.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/sep/01/from-fun-house-to-mr-majeika-the-best-shows-citv-ever-made-before-closing-forever">Continue reading...</a>

A journalist flying to the Venice film festival earlier this week is wheeling her luggage through the duty-free shop on her way to the gate. Pausing to glance at the illuminated perfume ads gazing at her from among the whiskey bottles and the Toblerones bigger than cricket bats, she sees the face of Zendaya, the 27-year-old star of the Spider-Man and Dune franchises, her hair rippling against a violet sky as she sits astride a white steed to promote Lancôme’s fragrance Idôle.</p><p>It is an eye-catching image, but also a bittersweet one. The journalist finds herself dabbing away a tear as she realises that this is the closest she will get to Zendaya for the foreseeable future.
