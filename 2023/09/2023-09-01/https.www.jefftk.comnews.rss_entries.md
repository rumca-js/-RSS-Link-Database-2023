After having fun with cooking/drying plums </span>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/making-prunes">last year</a>, I decided to have another go
this year. This time I compared two different ways of cooking whole
plums: 140F for ~1.5d vs 350F for ~1.5hr.



<p>

I was curious whether the higher temperature was better or worse.
Maybe interesting flavors are lost with higher temperatures, or maybe
they're lost with longer time?  Maybe these approaches differ in how
they convert starch to sugar?

Here's a picture of the 350F plums as I was removing them from their
tray:

After taking them out I manually removed the pits, and I made sure to
scrape the pan with a spatula to get the tasty juice.
