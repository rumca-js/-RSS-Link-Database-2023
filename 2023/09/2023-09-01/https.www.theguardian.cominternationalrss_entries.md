<p>Two-hour, 45-minute concert film shatters cinema chain AMC record and figure only represents part of presale haul</p><p>Taylor Swift broke an AMC record on Thursday with $26m in presale tickets for her Eras tour concert film, besting Spider Man: No Way Home’s $16.9m. The figure only represents part of Swift’s presale haul, as it doesn’t include other cinema chains such as Regal, Cinemark and Harkins.</p><p>Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, which will run for four weekends starting 13 October, seems poised for a huge box office haul – so much so that it has affected the fall release schedule. Horror sequel The Exorcist: Believer was originally slated to enter theaters on 13 October, is now premiering a week earlier, on 6 October. ““Look what you made me do. The Exorcist: Believer moves to 10/6/23,” producer Jason Blum <a href="https://twitter.com/jason_blum/status/1697334645225041933">wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, on </a>Thursday, along with the hashtag #TaylorWins.

<p>Melancholy permeates a sardonic tragicomedy in which the hangover of the Troubles is never far from the surface</p><p>If, post-Sally Rooney, it’s the job of the young female novelist to take the pulse of a generation, the diagnosis so far is worrying. In a burning world where job security and home ownership are a laughable dream, what’s left is a fixation on emotional life; the chase for romance, however fleeting. At its most basic, we’re left with a “does she get the guy?” narrative arc, without Rooney’s problematising acuity.</p><p>Newcomer Rachel Connolly strikes the by now familiar tone of confusion and melancholy, but with a piercing penetration and observational clarity. Belfast, if not a lazy city, is certainly a wary, “post-conflict” one. Erin, the narrator, considers what it means to hail from there: “It’s not like I can compare it with growing up anywhere else.” Her interlocutor is a lonely American academic with scarily perfect teeth whom she meets in a bar.
