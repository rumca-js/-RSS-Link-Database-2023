<p>The new memo is that because Mitch McConnell doesn't know where he is, how all these people got in his room, or who crapped his pants, it makes it harder for Republicans to blast Joe Biden for not knowing where he is, how all these people got in his room, or who crapped his pants. It doesn't work like that. </p><p>It helps to point out the difference between republicans/conservatives as a group, and forty-nine GOP senators. Those of us who mock D'oh Biden ALSO think no one over eighty should be allowed to hold elected office. Some would say no one older than seventy-five.</p><
