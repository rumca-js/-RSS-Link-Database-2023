<p>Manufacturers go to great pains to design specialist devices that give players an edge, with enhancements like unique body sizes and shapes, customizable weight, and extra grips to increase speed and accuracy. On top of that, the best gaming mice have unique hardware enhancements like highly sensitive sensors and complex button configurations to keep up with fast paced games. </p>



<p>Deciding on the right mouse is a highly personal decision that needs careful consideration. Factors like the size and shape of your hand, your preferred grip style, the types of games you play, and the number of buttons you need, are all factors in your quest for the best gam

<p>The internet is abuzz with news about <em>Starfield</em>, Bethesda&rsquo;s newest open-world (open-worlds?) RPG with a spacefaring twist. The game doesn&rsquo;t even officially launch for another week, but players who shelled out for the $100 premium edition are playing it right now. The game is already seeing hundreds of thousands of concurrent players, despite pre-release controversy about the developers <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2036461/amd-comments-on-starfield-fsr-controversy.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">prioritizing AMD&rsquo;s FSR upscaling over Nvidia&rsquo;s DLSS</a>. But as is always the case with Bethesda RPGs, there&rsquo;s a mod for that. </p>



<p>Specifically, the <em>Starfield </em>Upscaler mod, which is <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/111

<p>Here&rsquo;s a peek behind the curtain of writing tech news every day: Sometimes the only suitable header image for the articles we write is a still frame from a web video. And that&rsquo;s kind of a pain to collect &mdash; on YouTube I typically have to set the quality as high as possible, then slow the playback down to 25% and hit fullscreen to wait for the interface to disappear before taking a screenshot. Google just made that particular bit of my job a lot easier with the latest addition to Chrome/YouTube, the ability to quickly copy a single frame of a video when it&rsquo;s paused. </p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s how it works. Open up Chrome, or any Chromium-based browser that&rsquo;s been updated recently (like Edge). Go to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://youtu.be/mccFsim-RRQ&amp;xcust=2-1-2051648-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://ww

<p>Lenovo announced two new display solutions at the IFA show in Berlin: a 3D display for content creation, and a pair of micro-OLED goggles for consuming that content (or anything else) on a pair of private screens that you can strap to your head.</p>



<p>The Lenovo ThinkVision 27 3D Monitor is a 27-inch IPS display that will ship at a whopping $2,999 beginning in January, while the Lenovo Legion Glasses will cost $329 and ship in October. Lenovo also announced the Legion 9i, a liquid-cooled laptop, and the Legion Go, its first entry into the handheld Windows gaming market.</p>



<p>By now, the concept of a lenticular display might not be that unusual: after all, Acer announced one with the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/702602/acers-newest-gaming-laptops-include-a-glasses-free-3d-display.html">Predator Helios 300 midway through 2022</a>, and Asus som

<p>Watercooling isn&rsquo;t that unusual on a desktop PC. But on a laptop? Absolutely. Lenovo&rsquo;s new 16-inch Legion 9i is the world&rsquo;s first liquid-cooled laptop without the need for an external pump, pairing top-of-the-line Intel Core i9-HX hardware with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 for prolonged gaming sessions.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ve seen Lenovo offer the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/819461/lenovo-legion-5-pro-review-2022.html">Legion 5 Pro</a> and the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1372718/lenovo-legion-5i-review-cranks-nvidias-rtx-3060-up-to-11.html">Legion 5i</a>, both gaming laptops that tried to offer slimmer profiles for mainstream use. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393905/lenovo-upgrades-legion-gaming-laptops-with-next-gen-ryzen-and-geforce-chips.html">Lenovo&rsquo;s Legion 7</a> sacrificed some of that for purer pe

<p>We&rsquo;ve seen Asus and Logitech take a swing, now Lenovo wants a turn at bat to take on the Steam Deck. The Lenovo Legion Go is another portable, AMD-powered, Windows-running game machine, but with some premium parts and a few tricks up its sleeve. In addition to removable left- and right-hand controllers, a la the Nintendo Switch, the design also shifts into a sort of gaming mouse setup. Lenovo will be selling an add-on set of VR-style glasses that give the gadget an immersive wearable display. </p>



<p>At the heart of the Legion Go is &ldquo;up to&rdquo; an AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme APU, the same chip powering the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1951380/asus-rog-ally-review-2.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Asus ROG Ally</a>.
