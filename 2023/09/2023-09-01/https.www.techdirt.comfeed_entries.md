There may come a time when journalists around the world are left to point at massive datacenters housing AI journo-bots that have perfectly replicated what human journalists can do, screaming &#8220;Dey took &#8216;er jerbs!&#8221; like a South Park episode, but today is not that day. And frankly, it doesn&#8217;t feel particularly close to being that [&#8230;]

You may have noticed that there&#8217;s a massive, bipartisan push afoot to pass &#8220;right to reform&#8221; laws in many states making it easier and cheaper to repair the things you buy. In a bid to undermine those laws, automakers and companies like John Deere have been using a fairly consistent playbook. One, they&#8217;ll lie about [&#8230;]

For years we’ve covered the silly triennial review process associated with Section 1201 of the DMCA. If you don’t know, Section 1201 is the part that makes circumvention of any “technological measures” a form of infringement, even if bypassing those technological measures is not for copyright infringing reasons. It’s actually even worse than that, because [&#8230;]

Censorship is a priority for prison systems. Despite publicly claiming to be instrumental in the act of &#8220;rehabilitation,&#8221; correctional facilities generally engage in the sort of non-productive paranoia that ensures the only resources prisoners have are&#8230; other prisoners. And we&#8217;re all supposed to act like it&#8217;s a surprise when people re-offend. Or worse, exit this [&#8230;]

Just after a judge granted an injunction against Texas’ adult content age verification law on 1st Amendment grounds, a judge in Arkansas did the same to that state’s social media age verification law. Trade organization NetChoice had challenged the law, and the court basically gave them a complete and total victory. Just like the ruling [&#8230;]

We&#8217;ve noted for years how there&#8217;s no limit of companies and organizations that over-collect data on your daily movement patterns, then fail to adequately secure that data. Whether it&#8217;s your mobile phone carrier, your smartphone maker, your favorite app, or a rotating crop of dodgy data brokers, our corrupt failure to pass even a baseline [&#8230;]

Given enough time and attention, informal parlance just becomes&#8230; parlance. And so it is for the Kansas State Police. For years, troopers have evaded the Constitution and applicable Supreme Court decisions to make the Fourth Amendment irrelevant. There&#8217;s a term for this: &#8220;Kansas two step.&#8221; Enough drivers have encountered it that it is no longer [&#8230;]
