<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth will remain a PlayStation 5 exclusive for just three months, though when other versions might release is still unknown.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-exclusive-to-ps5-for-at-least-three-months">IGN</a> noted, a footnote during the game's September State of Play trailer read "not available on other formats at least until May 29, 2024." Since Rebirth releases on February 29, 2024, that means Sony's deal with Square Enix grants three months of exclusivity. When PC or Xbox versions might launch is entirely up to speculation.</p><p>Final Fantasy VII Remake released April 2020 followed by the PS5 upgrade, Intergrade, in June 2021. The PC version was then released later that December. Remake has yet to make it to Microsoft's console, though Xbox boss Phil Spencer recently teased in an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-final-fantasy-7-remake-and-ff16-ever-hit-xbox-phil-spencer-responds-gamescom-2023

<p>Fans of the Soulslike genre have long been divided on whether the games should allow you to respec your ability points or if you should be forced to live with your choices permanently. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lies-of-p/">Lies of P</a> opts for the middle-ground by allowing respecs but forcing players to wait until very late in the game to access the feature. If you're wanting to reallocate some stats, here's how to respec in Lies of P.</p><h2>How to respec in Lies of P</h2><p>The ability to respec in Lies of P comes rather late in the game. You'll need to progress the main story to <strong>Chapter VII</strong> and explore the entirety of the Grand Exhibition, ultimately defeating its final boss and earning yourself a key to open the door to the Saintess of Mercy Statue.</p><figure style="width: 3840px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4187923-liesofp_20230901020439.jpg"><img alt="You can reset your level, P-Organ allocations, and Le

<p>One of the most useful features in many Soulslike titles is the addition of co-op, allowing friends or strangers to join up with you temporarily for difficult areas or bosses. But in the case of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lies-of-p/">Lies of P</a>, you won't be able to summon any real people into your game. That doesn't mean you have to face off against bosses entirely solo, though. Here's how summoning works in Lies of P.</p><h2>There is no co-op in Lies of P, but you can summon spectres </h2><p>Whereas many Soulslike games' summoning methods are surprisingly cryptic, Lies of P simplifies the process quite a lot. You can only summon a spectre before boss fights to assist you with that single fight--meaning that they'll disappear once either they or the boss dies.</p><p>In order to summon one of these spectres, you'll need to use a <strong>Star Fragment</strong> on the glowing blue chalice that can always be found right outside of any boss arena.

<p>There are certain gameplay mechanics that tend to show up in every Soulslike game, and one of those is a limited healing flask that can have its uses replenished after every visit to a checkpoint. That trend continues in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lies-of-p/">Lies of P</a> via a healing item known as Pulse Cells. While you'll only have a few to keep you alive in the game's early hours, you can earn up to seven more Pulse Cells as you continue your perilous journey. Here's how to get them.</p><h2>How to get more Pulse Cells in Lies of P</h2><p>You'll begin Lies of P with three Pulse Cells, but you'll be able to gain more in a variety of ways.

<p dir="ltr">While playing Insomniac's Spider-Man 2 and searching for a way to verbalize my overall impressions, I kept coming back to the phrase "more of the same" but in this case it's important to clarify that "more of the same'' means more of one of the most accomplished, thrilling, and authentic superhero experiences of all time. It means more of a game that allows us to live out the fantasy of being a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man better than any other medium. For my money, Insomniac's games are the only place where longtime web-heads can think about that iconic phrase "with great power must come great responsibility," feel the full weight of what it means, and have personal involvement in making sure Spider-Man lives up to Uncle Ben's guiding principle.</p><p dir="ltr">The weight of that responsibility has never been more apparent or felt as heavy as it does in Marvel's Spider-Man 2, which presents a much larger neighborhood for Spidey to do his friendly adventuring in.

Due to a short review period and the impressive scope of the game, many outlets including GameSpot have yet to release their reviews, or have published a review in progress.</p><p>Enough reviews are now available for the game to be scored <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mortal-kombat-1/">on Metacritic</a>, with the PS5 version of Mortal Kombat 1 currently sitting at 86.
