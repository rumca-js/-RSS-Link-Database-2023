Luffy and the Straw Hat crew are continuing their journey to the Grand Line with a second season on Netflix. The legend himself, Eiichiro Oda, announced in a pretty cool video posted on Twitter that he and the team are moving forward with a second season on the streaming platform, as well as teasing the pirate crew’s doctor, Chopper. The Netflix #OnePiece series was quite the success for the streaming platform out of the gate, and with positive reviews it’s no wonder it was renewed for a second season. But it seems the producers behind the Netflix series are thinking well beyond a season two. In other news, remember that Lando Calrissian Star Wars series Donald Glover and his brother Stephen Glover were working on? That was originally set to stream on Disney Plus, but is now being developed into a feature film.

Party Animals reviewed on PC by Charlie Wacholz. Also available on Xbox Series X/S.
With smooth online multiplayer, a handful of mostly distinct maps, and downright adorable characters, Party Animals delivers a fun party game that brings cuddly, chaotic fun where it counts the most. The intentionally wobbly controls take a moment to get used to, but once you do it’s wonderfully satisfying to land a punch and send another player flying into an environmental hazard for a KO. It does commit an all-too-common cardinal sin for contemporary multiplayer games in making local play less enjoyable than going online, but all three main modes are a good time, especially in a full lobby of eight players.

The bone-crunching gameplay of Mortal Kombat 1 is some of the best the series has ever seen, thanks to the game-changing Kameo system. Netherrealm delivers a fantastic single-player story mode as well. However, the new Invasions mode is a grind and the online options feel dated.

Mortal Kombat 1 review by Mitchell Saltzman on PlayStation 5. Also available on Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Switch.

The Crew Motorfest reviewed by Luke Reilly on Xbox Series X. Also available on PlayStation, Xbox One, and PC.

"It’s said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. LEGO has Mega Bloks. E.T. has Mac and Me. Now Forza Horizon has The Crew Motorfest. To be fair, Motorfest is a robust racer with a confident sense of style, a quality arcade handling model, and a long list of generally well-planned events right out of the box. However, the shift to a smaller map has seen it lose a part of its old identity, boats and aircraft feel like they’ve been sidelined, and some of its event Playlists work a lot better than others. Ultimately, The Crew Motorfest is a little more Ice Ice Baby and a little less Under Pressure. It’s a catchy enough copy, but it ain’t exactly back with a brand new invention."

Dune: Spice Wars reviewed by Leana Hafer on PC.

A clever, multilayered, challenging RTS that translates the very essence of Dune into systems that demonstrate a respect for the lore and an uncommon understanding of interesting strategic gameplay. It looks great, it sounds great, and the pacing is excellent.
