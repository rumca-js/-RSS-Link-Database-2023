The Crew Motorfest moves away from the mainland United States setting of its predecessors, instead taking players to the gorgeous Hawaiian island setting of O’ahu, and in doing so, it delivers the series’ best outing yet. The open world is beautiful and boasts incredible environmental diversity, and that combines with well-designed and varied Playlists, as well as significant improvements in the moment-to-moment driving mechanics, to deliver what’s probably the most enjoyable Crew game to date. 

It borrows liberally from the Forza Horizon franchise, what with its festive setting and its celebration of car culture, and even though it never quite touches the same heights as Playground Games’ series, it does benefit from that pivot in several ways. For fans of the genre, this is an easy game to recommend.

Lies of P puts players in the shoes of Pinnochio in a new interpretation of the classic children’s story. The game puts a dark twist on the classic tale about lying, offering up an interesting new setting in the form of Krat.

The game pairs Bloodborne and Sekiro-inspired combat with quite a few of its own interesting ideas, especially in terms of how weapons work and how they can be further customized to a player’s own liking. Pairing these weapons up with Legion Arts that offer up even more utility and combat options opens up the game to quite a few interesting play styles, all of which can be equally viable against its wonderfully designed enemies and bosses if you’re good enough.
