Vehicle miniatures have a LOT of detail these days, but you can still paint them QUICKLY and EASILY.

Check out the Revenant's Run GameFound campaign and buy direct after the campaign is over (if you missed it) at http://www.idemogames.com 

Vince Venturella and I made another game! Check out MAJESTIC 13 at http://www.majestic13game.com

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
