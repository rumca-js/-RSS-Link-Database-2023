Looking back, Agents of Shield may have just been Marvel's attempt at claiming territory in the network television space, but after 7 Seasons it proved to be more than a flash in the pan.  Though one glaring issue with Agents of Shield is the complete disconnect from the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.  One major casting choice could have fixed all of that, by casting Samuel L Jackson's Nick Fury as the lead of Agents of Shield instead of Clark Greggs Agent Coulson.
