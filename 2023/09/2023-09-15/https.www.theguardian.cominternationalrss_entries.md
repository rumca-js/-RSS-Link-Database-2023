It’s a gentle story, as he tells it, though as he talks, one suspects the past decade has smoothed the edges of events that must have been painful.</p><p>Smith, speaking via computer, has requested that we keep the cameras off, and his voice rises in a steady, amiable monologue. “I left the band.

In story after story, headline after headline, they emphasize not his administration’s accomplishments, but the fact that he’s 80. A New York Times headline during his recent diplomatic mission to Asia epitomized this, turning the president’s joke about jet lag into an impression of a doddering fool: “‘It is evening, isn’t it?’ An 80-Year-Old President’s Whirlwind Trip.” Ian Milheiser of Vox nailed the problem: “I worry the ‘Biden is old’ coverage
