In 458 BC, the Romans needed a dictator (an office reserved for extreme emergencies in Roman times) to respond to a massive enemy invasion. Cincinnatus was appointed, reached his command, defeated the enemy, and laid down his dictatorship after just 16 days. He returned to his farm and didn't bother with public service until called upon again years later.

He became a legend to Romans â€” twice given unbounded power and twice relinquishing it as soon as he had fulfilled his duty.
