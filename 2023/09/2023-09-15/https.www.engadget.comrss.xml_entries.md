## Apple will release software update to address iPhone 12 radiation concerns

<p>Apple is prepping a software update to address alleged radiation concerns regarding the three-year-old iPhone 12s after French regulators alleged that the phone exceeds proper radiation levels. France stopped selling the smartphones after recommendations from the country’s radiation watchdog (ANFR), but Cupertino denies the allegations and seems to place the onus on the European nation’s testing protocols, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-implement-iphone-12-update-next-few-days-france-minister-2023-09-15/"><ins>as reported by </ins><em><ins>Reuters.</ins></em></a></p><p>To that end, Apple has reiterated that this isn’t a safety concern and notes that the phone was certified by multiple international bodies as compliant with global radiation standards. The software update won’t adjust radiation levels, as that would be a hardware issue, but it will “accommodate the protocol used by French regulators.” So it looks like Apple thinks the software patch will be enough

<p>During its iPhone 15 event, Apple released a sketch where CEO Tim Cook and VP Lisa Jackson bragged about the company’s environmental goals with Octavia Spencer’s Mother Nature. It was a flex to help bolster the marketing around the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-9-can-handle-siri-requests-without-your-iphone-171920001.html">Apple Watch 9,</a> some versions of which are sold as carbon neutral.

<p>Spider-Man is easily one of the most recognizable fictional characters of the last 50-plus years, appearing in countless iterations across comics, movies, cartoons, video games and other media I am surely forgetting. Fans will argue about the best iteration — but for my money, the Spider-universe Insomniac Games introduced in 2018 on the PS4 with <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man</em> is an all-time great. It spent no time rehashing Peter Parker’s origins, throwing the player into a vibrant and massive rendering of Manhattan. The city felt alive, with tons to do investigate and a horde of Spider-Man’s most famous villains to contend with. It also skillfully introduced a world in which Parker would eventually fight side-by-side <a href="https://www.engadget.com/miles-morales-ps5-review-spider-man-161228925.html">with a second Spider-Man, Miles Morales</a>.</p><p>But, most importantly, <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man</em> was an absolute delight to play.
