Product Description:
This authentically detailed scabbard replica is a reproduction of the actual filming prop used in “The Lord Of The Rings” films presented by New Line Cinema. It is designed to fit the Sword of Eomer (UC3383). It features a solid metal chape, collar, and locket with horse heads, all finished with an antique brass-plating. The wood core is wrapped in durable PVC leather to match the look of the prop. Close attention to detail was a top priority. All officially-licensed replicas feature the film copyright notice clearly marked on the product along with a certificate to verify its authenticity.
