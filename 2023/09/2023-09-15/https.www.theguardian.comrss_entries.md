<p>Erik ten Hag’s goalkeeper loves shouting at his defenders – it was one reason why he was brought to Old Trafford </p><p>I like Jamie Carragher. He’s an excellent pundit, a football obsessive, always engaging. He looks good lurking around a lighted plinth in designer man-trainers waiting to point at things on a massive screen. He’s perfect for that Sky studio role: steeped in English club-football culture, but also buzzing with modernity, tactical details, patterns you couldn’t previously see.</p><p>But I do think he’s wrong about André Onana and the politics of shouting at Harry Maguire. In <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2023/09/14/harry-maguire-england-mental-welfare-gareth-southgate/" title="">his newspaper column this week</a> Carragher offered a well-reasoned defence of Maguire, railing against his status as chief public whipping boy, with the strong central point that he should simply be rested for his own good.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football

Namibia have now played 24 World Cup games, and lost every one of them. They are a proud team, amateurs in the large part, working on a shoestring budget and desperate for their first victory. Battered 52-8 by Italy in the first round, now 71-3 by New Zealand, they have to play France next, for goodness sake, before they get to their last game, and the one they’re really targeting: Uruguay.

Taking part in warmups and bowling practice has given Flintoff, 45, a chance to be seen in public for the first time since his near-death crash last December.

One resembles an African tribal mask, with a furrowed brow and shock of wiry hair. Another has the air of a bossy teacher, a pair of handles forming the shape of hands on hips. A third looks like a Japanese warlord (although Vriesendorp insists it is a French nun carrying a handbag). “If they are eventually thrown away,” she quips, “at least the fish will have something nice to look at.”</p><p>Few might ever have

The German auteur has directed 75 films, at a rate of more than one a year, amassing a body of work that is esoteric, wide-ranging, ecstatic and often disturbing.</p><p>Yet despite the deep philosophical resonance of his work – and the Eeyorish monotone of his much-imitated voice – he is also a hero of pop culture, famous for his unexpected obsessions (a horror of chickens, a fondness for the Old Firm derby) as well as surprising cameos in <em>The Mandalorian</em>, <em>Jack Reacher</em> and various good-natured American comedies.</p><p><em>Every Man for Himself and God </em><em>Against All</em> by Werner Herzog is published in the UK by Vintage (£25) on 19 October.

As well as growing lots of fruit and veg we have planted many different flowers. Across the summer we saw some unusual moths, such as the ghost moth, and then from August onwards the butterflies started to appear. We mostly spotted red admiral, peacock and small tortoiseshell butterflies. They particularly liked the cosmos and the corn marigolds. They also liked the ragwort, which later had cinnabar moth caterpillars. On sunny days they were constant companions to our gardening. Although we have seen large white butterflies, too, we don’t seem to have had any problems wit

<p>Seven years ago, I fought my school for the right to wear the hair I was born with. Now I work as an ambassador for change</p><p>This autumn I’m about to start my final year of university.

<p>A new autobiography sheds light on John’s songwriting partner – someone who wrote lyrics with astonishing empathy, and cleverly documented the music scene that surrounded the pair</p><p>As befits a lengthy autobiography by an artist who, as the cover puts it, is “a famously private person”, we learn a great deal about lyricist Bernie Taupin from Scattershot: Life, Music, Elton and Me, published this week.</p><p>We discover that, low public profile or not, Taupin enjoyed the fruits of his success in almost as lavish a style as his songwriting partner Elton John: while holidaying in Barbados in the mid-70s, he rectifies the problem of having forgotten to buy a birthday present for his then girlfriend by simply flying to New York, picking something up at Tiffany, then immediately flying back to the Caribbean. We learn that the man who wrote the lyrics for Candle in the Wind wasn’t a fan of Marilyn Monroe, and that the man who <em>rewrote</em> the lyrics for Candle in the Wind so it c

<p>Starry new drama The Long Shadow takes an innovative approach to the murders that rocked 70s Yorkshire. Its creators talk crippling nerves, dodging stereotypes – and writing the Ripper out of the story</p><p>In the 70s, the newspapers nicknamed Peter Sutcliffe the “Yorkshire Ripper”. It was a term that became synonymous with the serial killer’s murder of 13 women – and attempted murders of seven more – in the north of England from 1975 to 80. So notorious did it become that it stuck in the public imagination in a way that the names of many of those who lost their lives at Sutcliffe’s hands did not, and it is almost unheard of for there to be a discussion of these awful crimes that does not mention it.</p><p>ITV drama The Long Shadow is changing that. Despite giving seven episodes to the long police investigation into Sutcliffe’s crimes, it strikingly never uses the term once, instead putting the victims at its heart.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/sep/1

Evidence of this, the writer pointed out, included the fact that the new king “has spent just two nights abroad on state business … [and] against advice, he attended all five days at Royal Ascot. When Prince of Wales he would only go to the first two, declaring it an indulgence when there was ‘real work’ to be done.”</p><p>So the royal advisors will presumably be seething both King Charles and Queen Camilla are expected to be at Doncaster for the St Leger on Saturday, when their colt Desert Hero will attempt to become the first winner of an English Classic in the historic scarlet and purple royal colours since Dunfermline in the same race in 1977.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.

<p>Win over Fiji has put spring in Warren Gatland’s step and an exciting young XV seems likely to entertain against Portugal</p><p>What a difference a win makes. Wales spent last week under siege conditions, fending off questions about their year to date, about their lowly ranking relative to opponents Fiji, even about the pre-match nerves of Warren Gatland, in Welsh rugby the most successful maestro of all. One bonus-point win later, they roll out an exciting young team and start talking about World Cup finals.</p><p>There is no doubting Wales’s World Cup pedigree of late, a semi-final, quarter-final and semi-final in the last three editions under Gatland, lost by margins of one point, four and three respectively. “I stated beforehand, don’t write us off,” said Gatland. “This team is capable of doing something special and I still believe that. For us it’s about one game at a time. We have done well in previous World Cups and would like to get to a final of a World Cup.”</p> <a href=

<p>The dining room is elegant and there are a few successes on the menu, but in aiming to serve Scottish seafood in a Spanish way, Cadiz somehow seems to have lost sight of Spain altogether</p><p>Cadiz has the air of a knowing, slightly upmarket joint that’s grappling for some type of authenticity. It’s there in the name – Cádiz is an ancient Mediterranean port, after all – and in the menu of <em>pulpo gallego</em>, seafood <em>arroz</em> and <em>jamón Ibérico</em>. Sometimes, when searching for the flavours of Spain in the UK, that is as good as it gets.</p><p>The Spanish have been terrifically good sports about what we Britons have done to their food over the years: chopped chorizo in syrah, stiff omelette masquerading as tortilla and bowls of frozen battered squid in place of delicate <em>calamar</em>. We stole the word “tapas” and changed its meaning from “fresh anchovy on a cocktail stick while on a balmy bar crawl in San Sebastián” to the really rather different “sitting down s

The pair meet in Liverpool to discuss putting Yosser and the lads on stage in a new era of economic desperation</p><p>Alan Bleasdale’s Boys from the Blackstuff opened up a Britain few viewers knew. “I’d been writing it for three years,” remembers Bleasdale, 77. “Walking around Liverpool, it was obvious mass unemployment was coming, but they didn’t realise in London. The BBC was initially reluctant to have a long series about these northern unemployed.”</p><p>In the 1982 drama, a group of Liverpudlian road layers struggling to make money are pursued by “sniffers” from the local employment office, which is trialling a Thatcher government initiative to reduce benefits. UK unemployment topped 3 million before the premiere of the series, whose character Yosser Hughes (played by Bernard Hill), a single father of three, pleads: “Gizza job.

Despite this, all these clothes fit just fine.</p><p>The size and shape of my body has remained more or less the same for years – it’s the ability to know whether or not a purchase will fit that has fluctuated.

Apparently “<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/sophie-turner-partying-divorce-statement-video-b2406917.html">she likes to party, he likes to stay at home</a>”, he’s been in “dad mode” caring for his own children “<a href="https://www.tmz.com/2023/09/03/joe-jonas-sophie-turner-divorce-lawyers-kids/">pretty much all of the time</a>” (Turner has been filming in the UK), and, in deciding to divorce, is taking “the best course of action for his girls”.</p><p>The misogynistic undercurrents

<p><strong>(Love Records)</strong><br />Diddy’s productions remain imaginative across this 24-track album, but he gives us frustratingly little lyricism</p><p>For one of history’s most influential rappers, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/diddy">Diddy</a>’s discography is surprisingly sparse: arriving three decades after he first made waves in the industry, The Love Album: Off the Grid is only his fifth studio album, and his first as Diddy (the artist born Sean Combs originally went by Puffy then Puff Daddy then P Diddy). That’s less strange when you take into account the particulars of his legacy – the business ventures that made him one of rap’s biggest moguls; the production prowess that helped unite hip-hop with R&amp;B – but it still feels like something this bumper 24-track record is designed to make up for.</p><p>Or, at least, that is the initial impression.
