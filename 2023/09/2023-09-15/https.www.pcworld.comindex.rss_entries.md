<p>Steam turned 20 this week, and Valve isn&rsquo;t just celebrating by <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2065529/steam-just-turned-20-and-were-getting-the-gift-of-cheap-games.html">putting games (especially its own titles) on deep discount</a>. No, the anniversary sale is even hotter now&mdash;you could say it&rsquo;s even <em>steam</em>-ier&mdash;as you can pick up one of the company&rsquo;s Steam Deck handheld gaming PCs at all-time low prices.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck&amp;xcust=2-1-2071322-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">discounts on the Steam Deck</a> go all the way up to 20 percent: the more you spend, the higher the discount. If you get the 64GB version (normally $399), it&rsquo;s a 10 percent discount, bringing the price down to

<p>The Recommended section within the Windows 11 Start menu has always been like the drain filter for your sink, catching files and photos before they swirl away to the depths of your hard drive. Well, now Start will collect even more: websites, adding to its collection of digital detritus.</p>



<p>Let&rsquo;s just be clear: Some people may find the Recommended section of Start to be useful &mdash; or just Start in general. I&rsquo;ve always had a love-hate relationship with it: I find it&rsquo;s much easier to simply type the Windows key + the name of the app I wish to launch, and go from there. Others may simply tap the Windows key to open the Start menu and click their preferred app. That&rsquo;s fine.</p>



<p>But in general, I&rsquo;ve never found Start all that useful, except for hunting down an app I&rsquo;ve forgotten the name of.</p>

<p>The xx70-class of Nvidia&rsquo;s GeForce graphics cards has been considered the middle of the pack for a long time. But it seems like with every new generation, that &ldquo;middle&rdquo; gets a little more expensive, and gamers are tired of paying out the nose for an upgrade. Maybe Nvidia and its OEM and retail partners agree&hellip;or maybe they&rsquo;re just feeling the heat from <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2055699/amd-radeon-rx-7700-xt-and-7800-xt-review.html">AMD&rsquo;s new $500 Radeon RX 7800 XT GPU</a> in the same range. Whatever the case, GeForce RTX 4070 cards from a variety of manufacturers are dropping a bit in price, from the launch price of $600 down to $550. </p>



<p>You can see the price drop from the usual suspects: <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BZHCQ6PF/&amp;xcust=2-1-

<p>The ThinkPad has been my personal go-to laptop brand for over a decade. I really dig the comfy keyboards (of course) and the low-key aesthetics. The last one I purchased was the first-gen ThinkPad X1 Nano, the smallest and lightest one Lenovo has designed yet. Frankly it&rsquo;s a bit overpriced, and in 2023, it&rsquo;s two years behind the curve. But I waited until it had a significant discount and was happy with my buy. Today you can get almost exactly the same laptop I bought, at an even better price. </p>

<p>Watching a power user go to town with keyboard shortcuts is quite a sight. Anyone who&rsquo;s been using an operating system long enough, and invested even a small amount of time in enhancing their productivity, knows what I&rsquo;m talking about. But you have to admit, not every single possible function needs a dedicated spot on your keyboard. Take &ldquo;Ctrl+Win+Alt+Shift+L,&rdquo; for example: It&rsquo;s a five-key combination that you probably need two hands to input correctly. Spoiler alert &mdash; the payoff isn&rsquo;t worth it. </p>



<p>This game of <em>Twister </em>for your fingers is a system-level keyboard shortcut that&hellip;opens up LinkedIn in your browser. That&rsquo;s it. It&rsquo;s a hard-coded, five-key shortcut to a website. Which might be a cool feature, if you got to choose what it was. But in fact, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/

<p>Well now <em>this</em> will be useful! Microsoft is adding a text recognition function (OCR) to the Windows 11 Snipping Tool. The new feature will let you to copy text from screenshots and paste it into word processing programs, for example. Currently, only Windows Insider testers from the Canary and Dev channels can try the new text copying feature in the Snipping Tool, though if all goes well you can expect to see it hit all Windows 11 machines at some point in the future.</p>

<p>If you are thinking about buying a new PC, you are usually faced with the crucial question of &ldquo;all in&rdquo; or &ldquo;low budget&rdquo;? Especially if you don&rsquo;t earn your money with your PC and are not a &ldquo;hardcore gamer,&rdquo; an inexpensive solution is often sufficient. But what should you look out for in detail?</p>

<p>Of course, savings need to be made on inexpensive PCs and it is not uncommon for system integrators to cut corners in such cases. The question is, however, in which areas have savings been made and does this have an influence on the performance and future security of the PC? Here&rsquo;s a guide on what to look for in your major components.</p>

<p>You need a password manager. Data breaches now happen regularly, and that flood of stolen info has made cracking passwords even easier. Not just the &ldquo;password12345&rdquo; variety is at risk&mdash;it&rsquo;s also any that use strategies like variations on a single password or substituting numbers for letters. Even if you&rsquo;re using unique, random passwords, storing them in a document or spreadsheet leaves you vulnerable to prying eyes.</p>



<p>While <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3207185/best-password-managers-reviews-and-buying-advice.html">paid password managers</a> offer nice extras, a free password manager still protects you from the risks of using weak passwords (or worse, using the same one everywhere). You just have to remember one password to access a single, secure place where all your other passwords are stored.</p>
