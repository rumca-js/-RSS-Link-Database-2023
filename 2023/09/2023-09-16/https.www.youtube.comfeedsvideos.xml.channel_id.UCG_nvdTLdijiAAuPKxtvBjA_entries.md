Barbie is a new hit movie from Warner Bros starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling who is literally like me. Everybody knows Barbie from the Barbenheimer event with Oppenheimer, but how exactly did it turn this brand that nobody cares about into gold? It's bigger than Marvel and Fast & Furious and Mission Impossible and even Mario. What!? How!? Well, by making a smartly positioned movie that attracts modern audiences. In today's Film Perfection, let's see how Barbie does that and how we can do that too with our own movies, even if we don't have an automatically successful brand like Mario at our disposal.
