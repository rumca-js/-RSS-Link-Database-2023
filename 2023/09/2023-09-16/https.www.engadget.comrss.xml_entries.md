<p>It's always good to see companies delivering updates and new features to devices long after they've launched. And Roland's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-17-roland-s-tr-8s-drum-machine-review.html">TR-8S</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roland-tr-6-s-review-classic-drum-machines-808-909-portable-143001780.html">TR-6S</a> were already pretty capable to begin with. But with the latest firmware updates they're picking up two huge new additions, including one that that I'm personally quite excited about.</p><p><a href="https://www.roland.com/global/support/by_product/tr-8s/updates_drivers/">TR-8S 3.0</a> and <a href="https://www.roland.com/global/support/by_product/tr-6s/updates_drivers/">TR-6S 2.0</a> add an ACB model of the CR-78 CompuRhythm and a chromatic TR-808 mode for building basslines.
