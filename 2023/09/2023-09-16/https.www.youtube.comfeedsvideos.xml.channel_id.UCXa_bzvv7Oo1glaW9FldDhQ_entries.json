However, it's also delivered off-shoots like The Legend of Nayuta: Boundless Trails, an action RPG not unlike its lesser-known Zwei series.\n\nAs a remaster of the 2012 PlayStation Portable title, Boundless Trails focuses on Nayuta, as his studies of mysterious ruins around his town lead him to an alternate world. By teaming up with Noi, he embarks on a quest to retrieve the Master Gears and stop the machinations of Zechst.\n\nDespite its straightforward approach and characterization, this is a solid title with some fun action platforming sections, a seasonal mechanic for more challenges and some stellar remastered visuals.
