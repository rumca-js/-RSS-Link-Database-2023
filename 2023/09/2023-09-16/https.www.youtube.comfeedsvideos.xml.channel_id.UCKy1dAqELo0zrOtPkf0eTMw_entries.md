We’ve scoured the galaxy far and wide in order to put together this helpful list of the 8 Best Side Quests that we’ve found in Starfield so far. Note that while much of Starfield is randomly generated, what we’ll point you to here is not, and you should be able to start these quests by simply going to the right place. The missions we’ve selected either reward you with something great or involve interesting characters and storylines that you might miss if you don’t know where to look. We’ll tell you how to start each quest as well as what makes them so noteworthy, but we’ll try to keep spoilers to a minimum so that you can enjoy the surprises that they have in store for you when you play them for yourself.
