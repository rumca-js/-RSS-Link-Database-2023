Starfield is officially out now, and modders have already begun changing whatever they can! We’ll have more zany mods coverage in the future (some of you out there are WILD, and I see you), but for now, we want to focus on some quality of life mods that may make your time traversing the galaxy a little more frictionless. Keep in mind we’ll be covering free mods for right now, and nothing like crazy graphical overhauls, just things to make playing the game a bit smoother or more tailored to personal taste. Here are the best quality of life mods so far in Starfield on PC.

Even though Starfield just released, a ton of mods have already been created, including the quality of life ones we have here, graphical overhauls, mechanic changes, and, of course, a picture of Phil Spencer to replace your flashlight. While it will take years to reach the saturation of something like Skyrim, the modding community is already well on its way to paper over some of the early cracks.

Big thanks to the m

## Starfield's New Game Plus Is Its Most Intriguing Concept, If You Get Lucky (Spoilers!)

Warning: Full Spoilers for Starfield ahead!

Starfield's New Game Plus is its most intriguing concept... If you get lucky. I’ve already hit Starfield’s credits screen four times. Not because I can’t get enough of playing Bethesda’s latest grand-scale RPG, but because I find the concept that powers its new game plus mode to be completely intriguing. Not to sound too much like Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar, but where I once thought I’d be losing dozens of hours exploring places in this galaxy, it’s actually what takes place in one room that has captured my imagination most.

From The Elder Scrolls to Starfield, join us as we explore how Bethesda defined the RPG. With sprawling galaxies to explore and an almost endless universe of things to do, Starfield is Bethesda's most ambitious game yet. While it's been in development for seven years, its roots can be traced back to the 1990s when Todd Howard rewrote the role-playing game rule book with The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. See the evolution of Bethesda RPGs through Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout 3, Fallout 4, and beyond.

When Anne’s beloved dog is kidnapped, they set out on a wild, cross-country trek to get the cash the only way they know how: by turning Anne into a bona-fide gameshow champion. The movie, which also stars Jason Schwartzman, Holland Taylor, Tony Hale, and Will Ferrell, is directed by Jessica Yu, written by Jen D’Angelo, and produced by Will Ferrell, Jessica Elbaum, Maggie Haskins, Itay Reiss, Jen D’Angelo, Awkwafina, and Sandra Oh, with Alex Brown and Erika Hampson serving as executive producers.

Quiz Lady will premiere on November 3, 2023, exclusively on Hulu in the U.S., Star+ in Latin America, and Disney+ in all other territories.

Check out the teaser for Goosebumps, an upcoming new series inspired by R.L. Stine's book series. The 10-part series stars Justin Long (“Barbarian”) and Rachael Harris (“Lucifer”), alongside newcomers Zack Morris (“EastEnders”), Isa Briones (“Star Trek: Picard”), Miles McKenna (“Guilty Party”), Ana Yi Puig (“Gossip Girl”) and Will Price (“The Equalizer”).

Plunging viewers into a world of mystery and suspense, the new “Goosebumps” series follows a group of five high schoolers as they embark on a shadowy and twisted journey to investigate the tragic passing three decades earlier of a teen named Harold Biddle — while also unearthing dark secrets from their parents’ past.

The new television series draws on elements from five of the most popular middle grade books including “Say Cheese and Die!,” “The Haunted Mask,” “The Cuckoo Clock of Doom,” “Go Eat Worms!” and “Night of the Living Dummy.”
