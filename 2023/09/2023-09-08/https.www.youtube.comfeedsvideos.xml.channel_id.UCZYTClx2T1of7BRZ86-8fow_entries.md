About 1.8–0.8 billion ago, the Earth went through a period known as the Boring Billion, where not a lot changed in terms of geology, evolution, or even the number of hours in a day. Some scientists call it “the dullest period in Earth’s history”; but if you look a little closer, there's a pretty interesting story to tell.

If you went to a show on the Eras tour but don't really remember it, you're not alone. And there's research to back up why there's a "blank space" in your memory of that Taylor Swift show.
