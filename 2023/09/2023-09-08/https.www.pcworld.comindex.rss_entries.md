<p>Intel and AMD&rsquo;s next-generation platforms are both here, with advanced technology like DDR5 and PCIe Gen 5. That means a plethora of motherboard choices, from frugal options, to the most princely. It also means more options for small form-factor PCs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After we picked the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1520957/best-gaming-motherboards-picks-for-intel-and-amd.html">best gaming ATX motherboards in 2023</a> in our last roundup, we&rsquo;ve set our sights on a new goal: finding the best small form-factor motherboards in 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Small form-factor will encompass two main sizes: Mini-ITX, with a diminutive 6.7&times;6.7-inch (170x170mm) size, and Micro-ATX, with a slightly larger size at 9.6x 9.6-inch. (244x244mm) footprint.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Microsoft Paint is finally testing background removal, the killer feature of Microsoft&rsquo;s Paint 3D that we hoped they&rsquo;d save. And they finally have!</p>



<p>In 2021, Microsoft pulled Paint 3D from Windows, ending its run of 3D VR applications. Unfortunately for Microsoft, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/401917/windows-mixed-reality-review-steamvr.html">Windows Mixed Reality bombed</a> and they began quietly removing apps like Paint 3D and 3D Viewer. (Paint 3D lives on as a Microsoft Store app, however.)</p>



<p>The idea behind Paint 3D and 3D Viewer was that you would create VR holograms that could be viewed by either the HoloLens or a third-party ecosystem of VR hardware. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/411893/how-to-use-microsofts-paint-3d-creating-cool-3d-scenes-has-never-been-so-much-fun.html">Paint 3D was fun</a>, even thoug

<p>Despite more and more tools to keep you safe, the web isn&rsquo;t actually getting any safer. To counter rising threats, Google has redesigned the Chrome browser&rsquo;s built-in protection scheme into the revamped Safe Browsing. This new version of the distributed defense system actively monitors the URLs your browser visits, and pops up a warning screen the second you stray into a part of the internet Google has determined is threatening. The update, which comes with a wider set of Chrome feature additions, should be live for everyone over the next few weeks. </p>



<p>Phishing is a particular focus of the new Safe Browsing features, as the threat is actively evolving. According to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blog.google/products/chrome/Google-chrome-new-features-redesign-2023/&amp;xcust=2-2-2060830-1-0-0&amp;sref=

<p>Microsoft has published a preview of a new open-source Dev Home app for Windows PCs. As you might have guessed from the name, it&rsquo;s aimed at developers &mdash; but also contains widgets that deeply helpful for PC enthusiasts.</p>



<p>Dev Home always shows, for example, the current temperature of the GPU, the clock speed of the CPU, the network throughput, and the utilization of the memory. </p>

<p>The long-awaited space role-playing game Starfield from Bethesda has been available for download since Tuesday. Many players immediately plunged into the game&rsquo;s 1,000 explorable planets. Now, however, reports of sudden crashes are piling up. The only fix is to restart the computer. And these Starfield crashes seem to be affecting some PC configurations more than others.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ryzen-cpus-in-focus">Ryzen CPUs in focus</h2>



<p>Although some owners of Intel processors also complain about sudden crashes, the majority of those affected have a Ryzen CPU installed. Certain moments in the game seem especially crash-prone, such as getting the watch from Barret or talking to certain NPCs. Unfortunately, the crashes are reproducible &mdash; so the next time you try to start the conversation, the computer crashes again.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2020882/onedrive-most-affordable-cloud-service.html">Microsoft&rsquo;s OneDrive cloud storage</a> is an integral part of Windows. Everyone who logs into the operating systems with a Microsoft account automatically receives 5GB of free storage. Among other things, you can use this to automatically save screenshots in the local sync folder of OneDrive so that they are synchronized with the cloud service, backing up the images effortlessly.</p>



<p>To do so, click on the OneDrive icon in the corner of the Windows taskbar, and then on the cogwheel in the top-right corner. Click on &ldquo;Settings&rdquo;, make sure you are in the &ldquo;Synchronize and backup&rdquo; tab, and set the switch next to &ldquo;Save screenshots I capture to OneDrive&rdquo; to &ldquo;On&rdquo;.</p>

<p>With the Steam Deck absolutely dominating PC gaming news over the last year and change, and plenty of gamers looking into the VR trend, it&rsquo;s no wonder that everyone&rsquo;s on the lookout for a new hardware gadget from Valve.

## Why you should avoid free VPN services

<p>A virtual private network (VPN) is a useful and sometimes indispensable tool for protecting privacy, circumventing country restrictions, or protecting oneself from persecution by totalitarian regimes. For example, you can use it to access your Netflix content from another country, send absolutely anonymous emails, or protect yourself as a whistleblower.</p>



<p>In principle, it works quite simply: Instead of connecting directly to the internet, you first log on to a VPN service through which all web traffic is redirected. Because you get a new IP address, curious people, trackers, or malicious actors can no longer follow you on the web. The new IP address no longer leads to one&rsquo;s own connection or internet provider, but only to the VPN service used.</p>



<p>However, this is exactly where the weak point of the process lies: If the VPN provider is not tr
