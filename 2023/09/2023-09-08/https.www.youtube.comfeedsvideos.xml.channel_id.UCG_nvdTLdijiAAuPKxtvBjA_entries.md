Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (Indiana Jones 5), takes Indy on an adventure through time, from the second world war to the second century before Christ... somehow (?). The movie as a whole is not the greatest and makes Kingdom of the Crystal Skull actually seem pretty good. But since everybody is making videos calling it bad, today I wanna highlight one thing it does well: using size-related writing tricks to make itself seem bigger like they used to do in the days of old-school Hollywood. If you can't afford to make your movie massive with expensive CGI like everyone else today, here's what you can do the same with writing.
