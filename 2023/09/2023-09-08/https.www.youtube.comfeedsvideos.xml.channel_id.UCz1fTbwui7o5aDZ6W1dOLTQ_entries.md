Join me as I dissect the portrayal of Lois Lane in the animated series, "My Adventures with Superman."  Does the modern rendition of this iconic journalist cast her as a dreaded Mary Sue, or is there something more than the surface level elements? We'll take a look at key elements of the character and show that might suggest she's an overly-perfected character, and see where the rabbit hole leads. Dive in to understand Lois Lane like never before. üîçüì∫ #myadventureswithsuperman
