From Dead Space and Resident Evil 4 Remake to Starfield, Final Fantasy XVI, Baldur's Gate, and Tears of the Kingdom, there's been no shortage of incredible games to play and even more are on the horizon. It feels safe to say that 2023 is one of the best years for gaming ever, and while it's incredible to have so many amazing games to play, are we able to really get the most out of the games we buy if we're juggling multiple titles or constantly moving from one massive title to the next? And what happens to the smaller games that aren\u2019t dominating the headlines?</p><p>On this week's Spot On, Tam and Lucy discuss why games always seem to launch around the same time, why that can be a bad thing, and how to overcome your choice paralysis.

He's been a standard bearer for American ideals, a universal symbol of American pop culture, and the other side of the long-lived argument about who would win between Batman and Superman. Throughout all of this, though, one of the stories that has stuck with the Man of Steel is that of the immigrant. Clark Kent looks and sounds like an all-American guy, but he wasn't born in the United States. He wasn't even born on planet Earth. He was born on the planet Krypton, sent via spaceship to Earth as the planet collapsed beneath his parents' feet.
