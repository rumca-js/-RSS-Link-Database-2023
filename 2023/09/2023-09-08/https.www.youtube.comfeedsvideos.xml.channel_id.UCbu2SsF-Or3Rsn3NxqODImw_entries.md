2023 is one of the best years for gaming ever, but it's presented gamers with a real first-world problem: choice paralysis. 

It feels like this year has been hit after hit. From Dead Space and Resident Evil 4 Remake to Starfield, Baldur's Gate, and Tears of the Kingdom, there's been no shortage of incredible games to play, and more are on the horizon. 2023 is one of the best years for gaming ever, and while it's incredible to have so many amazing games to play, are we able to really get the most out of the games we buy if we're juggling multiple titles or constantly moving from one massive title to the next?

A spoiler-free list of recommended quests and activities you'll want to do in Starfield.

Alright, look. Starfield is a big game with so much to do it's frankly overwhelming. And once you’re past the introduction the game leaves it up to you. That freedom is exciting, but comes with the potential risk that the direction you decide to wander… could be really boring. I’m not joking when I say that my opening hours had me doing thrilling missions like buying someone a coffee, delivering a pair of boots to a space station, and buying someone a beer.
