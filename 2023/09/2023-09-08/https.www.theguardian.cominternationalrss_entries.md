Biden opened his address to the summit by describing his motivation for holding it: “in the face of sustained and alarming challenges … democracy needs champions”.</p><p>Since that time Biden has embraced, as allies, autocrats and would-be autocrats all over the world, including the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, who US intelligence has said was responsible for the brutal murder of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. More recently, Biden invited Benjamin Netanyahu, who is presiding over the destruction of Israel’s democracy by targeting its judicial system, for an official visit to the United States.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/sep/08/biden-india-modi-g20-autocrat">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An opening clash against old foes New Zealand gives Fabien Galthié’s side the chance to prove they really can go all the way</p><p>It is baking hot in the City of Light, warm enough to make rugby union even harder than usual. The Stade de France can be a chilly, impersonal place but it felt like a giant concrete microwave as the local heroes eased through their final training session ahead of Friday night’s scene-setter against New Zealand, with temperatures of about 30C expected for the opening ceremony.</p><p>By the time the first ball of the 2023 Rugby World Cup is kicked it might be fractionally cooler, but it is already clear this tournament will demand serious fitness and mental stamina. Extending the competition to seven weeks, ironically on player welfare grounds, has also added another dimension. By the time everything fully reaches the boil back in the same massive cauldron on 28 October, one or two sides will have wilted around the edges.</p> <a href="https://www.thegua
