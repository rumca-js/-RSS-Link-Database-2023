<p>X, the company formerly known as Twitter, may not be labeling its ads properly, putting it at risk of — once again — running afoul of the FTC. There have been numerous reports over the last several days of ads appearing in users’ timelines without being labeled as such, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/08/x-formerly-twitter-caught-running-unlabeled-ads-in-users-following-feeds/"><ins>according to</ins></a><em>TechCrunch</em>, which was first to report on the stealth ads.</p><p>According to their reporting, as well as reports from industry groups, users have identified numerous ads that leave off the typical “Ad” label that identifies the post as paid advertising rather than a native post. It’s apparent that the posts are, in fact, ads when clicking into the “...” menu in the tweet, which indicates the tweet is a paid promotion.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While the unlabeled ads have irked users, who may mistakenly believe the platform is showing posts from

The title is coming to the PS5, of course, but also the PS4 for those who have yet to make the leap to next-gen. As always, it’ll be free to download.</p><p><em>Roblox</em> was already available on just about every other platform, including PC, Mac, iOS, Android and Xbox, though it's still not available for the Switch.

<p>Epic Games chief creative officer Donald Mustard is stepping down.

<p>Patreon creators have a <a href="https://news.patreon.com/articles/patreon-all-in-on-community"><ins>new option to interact with fans,</ins></a> as the subscription platform just rolled out a group chat feature. This community chat allows creators to interact with adoring fans, but also lets subscribers talk to one another in a space outside of comments. Creators can have up to four chats going at once and there’s a toolset in place to allow certain restrictions as to who can participate. For instance, a creator can limit a specific chat to various subscriber tiers.</p><p>Patreon group chats are exclusive to the mobile app for now, but the company says a desktop version is in the works. Yes, this all sounds suspiciously like Discord, which Patreon acknowledges, referring to the feature as “essentially a simpler, in-app Discord server.” However, it’s not like Discord has a patent on group chats. Patreon says the tools aren’t meant to replace Discord, as creators will still have acc

<p>Clogs in water recovery systems on the international space station have been so backed up that hoses have had to be sent back to Earth for cleaning and refurbishing. This is thanks to the build up of biofilms: a consortium of microorganisms that stick to each other, and often also to surfaces — the insides of water recover tubing, for instance. These microbial or fungal growths can clog filters in water processing systems and make astronauts sick.</p><p>So space, like Earth, has a germ problem – so what? Because biofilms can compromise the integrity of and damage equipment, including space suits, recycling units, radiators and water treatment facilities, it can cost space agencies loads of money to replace affected materials.

<p>One of the consequences of Brexit was that the UK was forced out of several key European Union science programs, including the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-14-uk-not-involved-europe-galileo-satellite-navigation.html">Galileo satnav project</a> and Horizon, the EU's flagship science research scheme. Now, the UK is <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_23_4374">set to rejoin Horizon</a> as an associate country under what UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called a &quot;bespoke deal.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>The UK will also become an associate member of Copernicus, the EU's £8 billion (€9 billion) Earth observation satellite program. It won't be rejoining the Euratom nuclear research group, however, instead choosing to focus on its own nuclear fusion research. Under the terms of the deal, the UK will contribute almost €2.6 billion (£2.2 billion or $2.75 billion) per year on average for its participa

<p>Tesla and Hilton have struck a deal to make EV charging more accessible while attracting guests to the latter's hotels at the same time. The companies have announced that starting in 2024, they will install 20,000 Tesla Universal Wall Connectors at 2,000 Hilton properties across the US, Canada and Mexico. This deal expands a previous partnership between the two and will see each chosen property get at least six new chargers.&nbsp;</p><p>Matt Schuyler, Hilton's chief brand officer, told <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=34e37b9c-8975-48da-aa39-df8bcd5badc3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CNBC&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNGUzN2I5Yy04OTc1LTQ4ZGEtYWEzOS1kZjhiY2Q1YmFkYzMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vMjAyMy8wOS8wNy90ZXNsYS10by1pbnN0YWxsLWNoYXJnaW5nLXN0YXRpb25zLWF0LTIwMDAtaGlsdG9ucy1pbi1ub3J0aC1hbWVyaWNhLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW5

<p>There was a time when Walgreens championed Theranos' blood tests and offered them at "wellness centers" in its stores. That was before it came to light that Theranos' tests were faulty, leading to a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-01-28-walgreens-theranos-breakup.html">bitter breakup</a> between the two companies. Now, according to <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-07/walgreens-to-pay-44-million-to-settle-theranos-fraud-claims?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, Walgreens has agreed to pay $44 million to settle a class action lawsuit brought by customers who received flawed Theranos blood tests through its centers in Arizona and California.&nbsp;</p><p>Lawyers for both sides struck a deal after a US district judge ordered the case to go to trial, and they filed a notice for a tentative settlement back in May. A court still has to approve the proposal, but based on the court filing by the plaintiffs, those customers will re
