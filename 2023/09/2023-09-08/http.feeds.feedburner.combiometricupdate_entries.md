		Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Identity and Access Management (OCI IAM) will support passkeys for passwordless authentication.

Compliant with the FIDO2 standard, passkeys pair private and public components of a cryptographic key to verify users. The private key is stored on a user’s device, behind its biometric safeguards. This lowers the risk of data and credential exposure via phishing, brute force attacks, and other methods of digital fraud.

“Passkeys are typically protected by your device biometric or PIN,” said <a href="https://www.oracle.com/">Oracle</a> in a blog post <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cloudsecurity/post/easier-stronger-and-smarter-authentication-with-passkeys-in-oci-iam">announcing</a> the introduction of passkeys in OCI IAM. “So, even if the de

		As deepfakes flourish across the world, countries are trying to come up with regulations that would reign in the threats they pose.

The latest efforts come from Europe’s top technical standards agency, which released a report on the risks of using artificial intelligence to manipulate digital identity representations. This not only includes fraud cases such as those in biometric authentication but also the potential to sow confusion, undermine elections and create conflicts.

The report, <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gr/SAI/001_099/011/01.01.01_60/gr_SAI011v010101p.pdf">titled ETSI GR SAI 011</a>, was released this week by the Securing AI group of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (<a href="https://www.etsi.org/">ETSI</a>).

		It's a brand-name roundup of biometric information privacy lawsuits today, with Clearview AI, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon battling in court across the United States.

The runt of this litter is Fresh Thyme Market, a regional supermarket with warehouse employees in the Midwest state of Illinois, home to the Biometric Information Privacy Act.

A judge this week rejected defendant's Fresh Thyme's motion to dismiss a BIPA putative class action (case <a href="https://ecf.ilnd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/iqquerymenu.pl?423807">1:22-cv-06541</a>) brought by employees in U.S. District Court.

		In Australia, good, old-fashioned paper-based statutory declarations are still legal. But the federal government has made digital stat decs just as legal.

The ramifications are mostly time related. Attorney General Mark Dreyfus <a href="https://www.themandarin.com.au/229731-two-decades-after-the-internet-became-a-thing-stat-decs-go-digital/">issued</a> a statement according to Australian news publisher The Mandarin that until this change, 9 million hours were spent annually shuffling 3.8 million stat decs.

The documents are not sworn statements, but the two have similar roles. The best example might be facilitating a name change, but they can also be used in patent applications, for instance.

Digital statutory declarations are another step closer to the paperless futu

		The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology is splitting the Face Recognition Vendor Test, renowned throughout the biometrics industry as the leading evaluation of facial recognition algorithms from developers around the world, into two.

The FRVT will be replaced with the Face Recognition Technology Evaluation (FRTE) and the Face Analysis Technology Evaluation (FATE), with the various tracks of the previous <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202209/what-is-the-frvt">FRVT</a> divided between them.

		The need for U.S. rules to control domestic use of AI has persuaded some lawmakers to push for outside help in legislating high-risk technology.

Biometric surveillance, digital identity infrastructure and data privacy are among the AI sectors confusing pols in the Senate and House. Congressional proponents of ongoing outreach to experts say neither the nation nor the economy can wait these ideas to be commonly understood.

If Washington needs examples of how to draw AI businesses into the regulatory mix (although Congress has <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/more-meetings-about-ai-regulation-being-discussed-in-us-congress">done this repeatedly</a> for significant technology advances), it can look at NIST.

		After complaints from low-income residents of the Philippines saying that some government offices and financial institutions have refused to accept their national IDs, the regional government agency in charge of the country’s digital identity project has warned that they may face fines.

The Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) in the Western Visayas region reminded this week that the Philippine Identification System (PhilSys) Identification Card (<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/philid">PhilID</a>) is a valid proof of identity, Panay News <a href="https://www.panaynews.net/refusal-to-accept-natl-id-carries-fine-psa-6/">reports</a>.

		Artificial intelligence is not only bringing a new level of sophistication to the efforts of fraudsters, but enabling them to automate cyber attacks with bots. Identifying those bots and detecting AI-powered fraud requires a similar advance in identity verification and authentication with technologies like liveness detection and behavioral biometrics.

How to do so will be explored in an hour-long webinar hosted by <em>Biometric Update</em> on September 19. “Battle of the Bots: Countering AI Attack with Identity Proofing” will feature <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/authenticid">AuthenticID</a> President and Founder Blair Cohen and <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/rank-one-computing-corporation">Rank One Computing</a> CRO Benji Hu
