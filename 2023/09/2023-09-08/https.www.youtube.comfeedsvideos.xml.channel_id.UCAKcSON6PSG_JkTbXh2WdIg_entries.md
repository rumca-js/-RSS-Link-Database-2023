Los Angeles band Local Natives released their latest album, "Time Will Wait for No One," on July 7 of this year, and they kicked off their tour in support of the album with a show at First Avenue in Minneapolis on August 18.

While in the Twin Cities for that show, Local Natives band members Taylor Rice, Ryan Hahn and Kelcey Ayer visited The Current studio in St. Paul to play stripped-down versions of songs from the record, and then they hung around for a chat with host Ayisha Jaffer — during which, they revealed (among other cool facts) their desire to land that coveted star on the exterior wall of First Avenue.

You can watch and listen to the full session above.
