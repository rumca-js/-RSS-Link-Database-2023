The YA fad was massive for a few years in the 2010s, with movies like Twilight and The Hunger Games being massive cinematic events around the world. The Maze Runner was arguably one of the last in the genre before it kind of died out and people moved ontoâ€¦ Streaming shows and more superhero movies I guess?

Maze Runner: The Death Cure definitely raises some questions. Like are we supposed to remember exactly what happened in that last movie several years ago? Did the good guys just doom the human race by getting their friend back? How are all these kids so good at shooting? 

To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to Maze Runner: The Death Cure!
