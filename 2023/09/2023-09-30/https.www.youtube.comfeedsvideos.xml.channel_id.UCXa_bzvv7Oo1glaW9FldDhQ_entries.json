The game features a minimalistic aesthetic with its story, visuals and gameplay, giving players little more than the ability to move and interact with things.\n\nThese interactions, being highly context sensitive, are where the puzzle designs of COCOON come to life. The game makes use of its environment to not only tell its story, but to design its puzzles as well, often hiding hints behind things like rotating puzzles or hidden platforms that can only be seen when making use of an orb\u2019s special ability.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZCOUBqQom4", "date_published": "2023-09-30T21:30:02+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/cZCOUBqQom4/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Super Mario Bros.

But what are the biggest lessons that the developer can take from the last three years as it moves into the future? \n\nHow can it improve its approach to not only development, but how it approaches marketing and launch for the likes of The Witcher 4 and Cyberpunk 2?
