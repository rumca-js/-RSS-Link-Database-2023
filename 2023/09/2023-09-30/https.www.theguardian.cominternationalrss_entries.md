<p>World Cup-winning one-day captain thinks England will do well but rates the hosts India as the favourites</p><p>In a sport that is forever transmogrifying its global tournaments, there is a degree of familiarity about this impending Cricket World Cup in India. It has the same structure as in 2019: 10 teams, round-robin, four semi-finalists thrown up by this league structure. But there is also one change of note in the regulations. All games, not just the semi-finals and final, will have a super over should the scores be tied. And if that super over throws up a tie, an unlimited number of additional super overs will follow until an outright winner is produced.</p><p>This tweak represents a tacit admission by the International Cricket Council about the famous finish at Lord’s four years ago.

<p>The satisfaction of a straightforward victory was, for Arsenal, topped by a moment that may have lasting significance. Kai Havertz has been subjected to intense scrutiny since moving from Chelsea, struggling to find his groove even if opprobrium has been premature in the extreme. A run of respectable all-round showings needed some end product and it came when, handed the chance to see off Bournemouth’s perfunctory challenge, he comfortably beat Neto from the spot. The away support had cheered when he took the ball; they could hail his first goal for the club within moments and Arsenal’s players, led by Gabriel Magalhães, made sure Havertz soaked up the acclaim.</p><p>Bukayo Saka and, with another penalty, Martin Ødegaard had already put Arsenal comfortably ahead. Ben White completed the rout with a header in added time and the win breathed life into their efforts to keep pace with Manchester City. It also meant the anticipated battle of wits between Mikel Arteta and Andoni Iraola,
