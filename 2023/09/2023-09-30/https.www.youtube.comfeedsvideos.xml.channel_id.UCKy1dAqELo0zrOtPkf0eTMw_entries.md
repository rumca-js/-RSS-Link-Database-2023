Hollywood has been big business for decades. First, there was TV, then there was syndicated TV, then cable, and now, we’re in the era of Netflix and streaming. 

In this video we’re going to talk about the history of the TV business, how Hollywood made money and how that money trickled down to the creatives that made it. Of course, we’re going to discuss the writers’ strike (Writer’s Guild of America) and the actors’ strike (SAG-AFTRA strike). But this is more than just one of those “strike explained videos”. We’re going to get into how TV Executives created one of the most profitable entertainment enterprises of all time and then how it all came tumbling down with Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video and the advent of streaming.
