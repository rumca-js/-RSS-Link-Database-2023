Swedish folk duo First Aid Kit — consisting of sisters Johanna and Klara Söderberg — harmoniously blend vocals, pensive songwriting, and flowery pop eventually leading to them building a devoted international following. 

Their latest studio album, "Palomino," still has strong roots in Americana and folk, but it also crosses more into ‘80s pop territory with its punchier drums, and increased instrumental variety — including synthesizers in some tracks. "Palomino" is available on @columbiarecords.  

Before their performance at The Palace Theatre in St. Paul, The Current’s Bill DeVille sat down with the sisters to discuss touring, their all-time favorite Leonard Cohen songs and Artificial Intelligence in music.

Watch and listen to the complete interview above.
