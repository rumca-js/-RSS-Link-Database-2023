  <p id="Gf6LbX">The iPhone 15 and iOS 17 do a whole bunch of new things that many of us here at <em>The Verge</em> enjoy, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23791165/apple-ios-17-standby-iphone-dock">one of our favorites</a> is Apple’s StandBy mode. The simple little feature turns your iPhone into a small smart display once you place it on a MagSafe / magnetic Qi stand in landscape orientation.

  <p id="M3VuJz">When I first saw the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses a few weeks ago, I noticed something. In the event space Meta had so carefully prepared, there was a wall showcasing the different frames, colors, and lenses. It was meant to visualize all the different style options — more than 150, in fact. But standing about 10 feet away, they all blended together.</p>

In this timeline, scientists have figured out how to conclusively determine if two people are in love. This upends relationships as we know them, with couples sticking steadfastly to the results of the test; if they get a negative result, they end up splitting up. It’s a cute conceit for exploring the ways relationships can grow stale or change over time, and <em>Fingernails</em> builds on that with its darkly comedic vibe. I
