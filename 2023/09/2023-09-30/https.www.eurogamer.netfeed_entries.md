</p><p>That's according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-09-29/why-playstation-fans-are-cheering-ceo-jim-ryan-s-departure?leadSource=reddit_wall">Bloomberg</a>'s Jason Schreier, who reported yesterday that "even Bungie's expertise has not yet been able to turn PlayStation Studios into a service-game factory".
</p><p>Just days after announcing its $3.6bn Bungie buyout bid, Sony announced back in April 2022 that it would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">launch more than 10 new live service games over the next four years</a>, with the hope that Destiny developer Bungie would aid PlayStation in this major expansion of live

In a week like this, and a year like this, it's not hard to see why. Marvel's Avengers, a mega-budget game that still feels relatively fresh, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-avengers-receives-hulking-discount-ahead-of-delisting">is being delisted</a>, while Hyenas, which looked weird and rather brilliant, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-has-cancelled-hyenas">has been cancelled</a> before it's even been released. It's heartbreaking, and my thoughts go out to everyone affected. People are losing their jobs and others are seeing their work forgotten. There's also a sense we're going to see more of this and more often. Hollywood is making movies that people will never see and TV shows that people will never binge,
