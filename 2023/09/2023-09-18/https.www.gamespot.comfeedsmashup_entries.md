<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mortal-kombat-1/">Mortal Kombat 1</a> is available now in early access and out on September 19 for everyone else, including on Nintendo Switch. Unfortunately for those who have already purchased the Switch version, it's now clear that NetherRealm's fighter looks very, very different on Nintendo's hardware than it does on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, or PC.</p><p dir="ltr">This, of course, is expected on some level. The Switch is not nearly as powerful as a modern gaming PC or current generation consoles. However, fans can't get over just how different the same game looks running on two very different types of machines. Despite the major reduction in visual quality, the Switch version costs $70, just as it does on other platforms. Even more confusing, Mortal Kombat 1 on Switch also looks to be a downgrade from the Switch version of Mortal Kombat 11, which released in 2019.</p><div><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@johniibo/video/72
