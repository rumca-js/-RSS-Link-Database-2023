A particularly popular way to make yourself known is to set up a website. You get full control over the platform, unlike with social media.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These days many services, such as WordPress or Blogger, offer websites on commercial domains, but in a lot of cases it makes more sense to have your website on your own domain&mdash;a personal place on the internet where you are in complete control of what&rsquo;s published and how it looks. Here&rsquo;s how to register your own domain name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When setting up your personal domain name, you have a lot of options and many vendors to choose from.

The man in charge of it all is Panos Panay, a nearly 20-year veteran of Microsoft&rsquo;s executive group and a huge part of the Surface and Windows teams.
