Illinois is the first state to ban it completely, although other states have eased regulations, according to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/09/18/1200076944/illinois-becomes-the-first-state-to-abolish-cash-bail#:~:text=Starting%20today%2C%20judges%20in%20Illinois,first%20to%20ban%20it%20completely." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NPR</a>. </p>

<p>Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach won a lawsuit to stop state agencies from allowing gender changes on state documents, which was previously allowed.</p>
<p>“The intent of #ksleg was clear when lawmakers passed the Women’s Bill of Rights.
