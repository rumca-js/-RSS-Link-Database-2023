Starfield sees you join Constellation, the last group of space explorers who are trying to discover the purpose of alien artifacts. This is the real history behind Starfield and of space exploration.\n#Starfield #RealHistoryOf #GameSpot \n\nWhile Starfield takes place in the far future, long after Humans have become a space-faring civilization, the game does take some inspiration from the real history of space exploration. Leading up to the release of Starfield, Bethesda stated the game was inspired by the US and USSR Space Race - which lead to the famous Mercury and Apollo space missions.\n\nThe team has described Starfield's aesthetic as \"Nasa-Punk\", inspired by the real NASA designs of the space-race era, with various space suits from Starfield bearing a resemblance to the Apollo era space suits.

Here is everything you need to know about Payday 3.\n\nSet several years after Payday 2, this third entry puts you back behind the masks of the gang that started it all. Dallas, Hoxton, Chains, and Wolf are forced out of retirement, and this time they'll be pulling off heists in New York City. Although these 4 are veterans and experts at their craft, they\u2019ll now have to deal with cryptocurrency, the dark web and mass surveillance.\n\nAt its core, Payday 3 is a first-person team-based shooter in which you pull off heists in order to take home the big bucks. So far the series has been all about executing a plan and adapting your tactics when things inevitably go wrong. Payday 3 is looking to keep that gameplay loop going, albeit with some interesting changes for returning players as well as those who are completely new to the series.\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - Intro\n00:16 - Story\n00:59 ", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ocjLObCdc", "date_published": "2023-09-18T16:30:10+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GameSpot", "album": "GameSpot", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/d4ocjLObCdc/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty Everything To Know", "description": "We\u2019re on the cusp of Phantom Liberty, the one-and-only expansion planned for Cyberpunk 2077, and it promises to introduce some sweeping changes and a spy-thriller story starring Idris Elba to the game.
