The Shanghai Commercial Paper Exchange releases commercial paper default data every month. Itâ€™s an important window for the outside world to observe the credit risks of Chinese banks. According to July 2023 data released in August, as of July 31, 2023, a total of 2,851 commercial bill acceptors had defaulted, an increase of about 80% from 1,554 in January. Among the defaulters of commercial bills, 271 are branches of state-owned banks and branches of local rural commercial banks, accounting for nearly one-tenth of all banks in China.
