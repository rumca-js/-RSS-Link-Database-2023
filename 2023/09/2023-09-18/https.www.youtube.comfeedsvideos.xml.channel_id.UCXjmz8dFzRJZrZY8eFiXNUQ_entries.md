Saved by the Bell is without a doubt one of the cornerstone sitcoms of the early 90's.  The cast of characters at Bayside High resonated with audiences at the exact right time.  Though Saved by The Bell was originally created as a completely different show, Good Morning Miss Bliss.  Though the studio couldn't quite get Good Morning Miss Bliss off the ground, the change to Saved by the Bell literally saved the show from complete cancellation.
