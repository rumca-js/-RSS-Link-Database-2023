A week after Unity announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-reveals-plans-to-charge-per-game-install-drawing-criticism-from-development-community">dramatic changes</a> to its Unity Engine business model - drawing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indie-developers-react-to-astonishing-scumbag-move-of-unitys-new-install-charge">immediate and widespread condemnation from the development community</a> - the company has reportedly told staff it'll be making adjustments to its controversial new pricing plan.
</p><p>
As reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-18/unity-overhauls-controversial-price-hike-after-game-developers-revolt">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, Unity leadership addressed employees in an all-hands meeting held earlier today (a meeting originally planned for late last week was c

In news that isn't likely to be much of a surprise to anyone at this point, a newly unearthed Microsoft court document has confirmed The Elder Scrolls 6 won't be making its way to PlayStation when it eventually shows up in 2026 or beyond.
</p><p>
Microsoft submitted the document (thanks <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/18/23878504/the-elder-scrolls-6-2026-release-xbox-exclusive">The Verge</a>) as part of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ftc-suing-to-block-microsofts-69bn-activision-blizzard-acquisition">court battle with the US Federal Trade Commission</a> over its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-near-deal-to-buy-call-of-duty-maker-activision-blizzard-report">proposed $69bn USD acquisition of Activision Blizzard</a> - the same court proceedings that saw Xbox boss Phil

Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick was briefed by Nintendo on Switch 2 in December last year. 
</p><p>
Emails between Activision executives - made public as part of the FTC's court case with Microsoft and published today by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/18/23878412/nintendo-switch-2-activision-briefing-next-gen-switch">The Verge</a>, albeit with many redactions - show that the company's controversial boss Bobby Kotick spoke with Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa about Switch 2 at the end of 2022.
</p><p>
Activision exec Chris Schnakenberg noted that the console was expected to be weigh in with a "closer alignment to Gen 8 platforms in terms of performance", referring to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One generation of consoles.

It's quite hard to believe it, but yes - yesterday marked 10 years since GTA 5 first released on PS3 and Xbox 360. 
</p><p>
It's undoubtedly become a milestone of recent gaming history, driven by an impressive figure of over <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-v-shifts-another-5m-copies-in-latest-take-two-financials-bringing-total-to-160m">160m lifetime sales</a>, critical reception, and endless controversies from developer Rockstar Games and its parent company Take-Two.

## Resident Evil 4: Separate Ways fresh footage shows Ada in action

Resident Evil 4's brilliant Separate Ways campaign starring fan-favourite Ada Wong has now been confirmed for launch as DLC for Capcom's equally brilliant Resi 4 remake. And today, we can now bring you more of a look at what to expect. 
</p><p>
Looking at the brand new footage, Ada seems to play very similarly to Leon, with the new parry mechanic very much in action, R2 knife opportunities to silence downed enemies, and silent knife takedowns for unaware ganados. The big difference for Ada, however, is that she comes equipped with her trademark grappling gun for tackling enemies at a distance and reaching new locations. Using the grappling gun to initiate a melee attack in particular looks a lot of fun, and it's also worthwhile noting that it seems grappling to a distant location can be immediately followed up with a melee attack to n

## Triple-A games are coming to iPhone 15 Pro - and the implications are mouthwatering

Up until now, the chances of it happening seemed vanishingly slight owing to the sheer range of hardware with a staggering breadth of horsepower and the correspondingly fragmented audience. Why attempt to port a game like Death Stranding to a phone if the vast majority of the audience can't run it? And do games like Death Stranding actually work as a mobile experience to begin with? We're about to find out, as last week's Apple keynote revealed two new iPhones - the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max - running games including Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil Village, Assassin's Creed Mirage and, yes, Death Stranding. </p><p>Apple says this is all made possible owing to the new GPU found within its cutting-edge A17 Pro silicon - the first 3nm processor to hit a mainstream consumer device.

No matter which graphical performance setting Spider-Man 2 players decide to opt for, ray tracing will be included as standard.

In an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/insomniac-answers-all-of-our-questions-about-spider-man-2s-ps5-tech">IGN</a>, Insomniac's director of core technology Mike Fitzgerald and project director Jeannette Lee shared more about the studio's upcoming PlayStation 5 exclusive.

The developers said the game was the "culmination of everything [Insomniac has] learned" about developing for PlayStation 5.

## $70 Mortal Kombat 1 Switch version called "robbery" as graphical comparisons flood the internet

Mortal Kombat 1 released in early access last week across Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S. Since then, several users have uploaded footage and screenshots showcasing the Switch version of the game - and the results aren't great. 
</p><p>
In fact, the version available on Nintendo's hybrid console has been widely panned, with many wondering how the developer can ask the same price on Switch as on other platforms. 
</p><p>
Fans have taken to the likes of X (formerly Twitter) and TikTok to question NetherRealm's decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-boss-not-seeing-pushback-on-70-price-for-games">market Mortal Kombat 1 as a $70 Switch release</a>.

Gaspar de Guzm&aacute;n y Pimentel, 1st Duke of Sanl&uacute;car, 3rd Count of Olivares, known to history as the Count-Duke of Olivares, is one of those historical figures who really deserves a video game made them. Not a video game that sees them as the hero, of course, but as the terrifying, grasping, mercurial villain. The Count-Duke was the favourite of Spain's Philip IV. In paintings from the era he fairly radiates malice and self-interest. He was huge and powerful, the epitome of the power behind the throne.
</p><p>
And I'm pretty sure he's the model for the villain in En Garde!, a spry and witty swashbuckling game set in Spain's golden age. The Count-Duke is everywhere in this game, even when he isn't dominating boss fights: he glowers from the walls in paintings that reference works of Velazquez and  - at one point - El Gr
