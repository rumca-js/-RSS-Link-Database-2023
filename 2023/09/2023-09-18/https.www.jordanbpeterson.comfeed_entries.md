<p>Jordan and the roundtable explore the remaining five of the ten commandments, interpreting their meaning through the King James and Hebrew lenses, and discussing how they apply spiritually, philosophically, and morally to our lives. They posit that we should view them not as a series of constraints but as enabling principles.</p>
<p>Episode One will be available on YouTube indefinitely, serving as the gateway to this enlightening exploration. Episodes 2 through 17 will be available for a limited time, so be sure to watch as they release each Monday.</p>
