But the revelations that someone under investigation for allegedly being a Chinese spy was operating at the centre of Tory debates will only make the atmosphere worse. The person in question has insisted he is completely innocent.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/sep/11/spy-allegations-heated-tory-debate-over-china">Continue reading...</a>
