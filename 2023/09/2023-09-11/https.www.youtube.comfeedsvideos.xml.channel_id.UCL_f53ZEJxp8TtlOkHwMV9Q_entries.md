Moses's descent from the mountain with the Ten Commandments had a significant impact on the Judeo-Christian tradition. The group discusses how these commandments provided fundamental rules that guided the tradition, providing a balance between tyranny and excess freedom and allowing for a more organized society.

Episode One will be available on YouTube indefinitely, serving as the gateway to this enlightening exploration. Episodes 2 through 17 will be available for a limited time, so be sure to watch as they release each Monday.
