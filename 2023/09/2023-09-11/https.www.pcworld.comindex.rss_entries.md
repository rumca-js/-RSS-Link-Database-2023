<p>When Zoom exploded in popularity in 2020 because of the pandemic, many people installed and used it for the first time. This necessity led to virtually everyone sticking to the basics of virtual meetings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But if you&rsquo;re still only using the core Zoom features, you&rsquo;re missing out. There are loads of ways to make your calls much more fun and useful, though it&rsquo;s not always obvious that they exist.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve highlighted eight of the best here. If you want to improve your video calling experience without buying a new webcam or microphone, look no further: we&rsquo;ve got tips that will help.</p>

<p>Portable monitors are a common sight on many desktops, and even more laptops. Though smaller than a standard monitor, portable monitors are inexpensive, easy to connect and, best of all, portable. You can pack up and move a portable monitor when needed, a perk that&rsquo;s equally useful for students, work-from-home parents, and globe-trotting executives.</p>



<p>There&rsquo;s just one problem: The portable monitor market is a bit of a mess. The widespread availability of small displays has opened the floodgates for numerous brands you&rsquo;ve never heard of, and quality is often sub-par. We&rsquo;ve tested multiple models to separate the best portable monitors from the rest.</p>
