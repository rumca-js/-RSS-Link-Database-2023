Coco Lee was known as the "Diva of Chinese Music." She sang the theme song for the Disney movie Mulan and was nominated for an Oscar for her performance singing the theme song for the hit movie, “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.” 
A month after her passing, on August 17, 2023, a nine-minute video of Coco appeared online. In it, she exposed unfair competition in a talent show, Sing! China, in which the show faked competition and bullied its participating performers.
