I did this by using the DreamBooth algorithm via fine-tuning. It only took about 5-10 images of myself. The results were pretty good (learning a new token, \u201cmattrickard\u201d on Stable Diffusion v1.5)\n\nThis time, I upgraded the model (SDXL) and upgraded the method (LoRA). Instead of fine-tuning, I was left with a relatively small (about 20 MB) of model weight deltas. I ended up doing LoRA applie", "link": "https://matt-rickard.com/fine-tuning-stable-diffusion-xl-with-personal-photos", "date_published": "2023-09-11T13:30:07+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Matt Rickard", "album": "Matt Rickard", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}]
