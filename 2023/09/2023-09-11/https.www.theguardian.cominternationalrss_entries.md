<p>And breathe. Into six of seven minutes of second-half stoppage time David Brooks sealed Wales’s crucial victory. Seconds before the relief when Danny Ward claimed a free-kick was audible from thousands of Wales supporters. Rob Page proclaimed he would take a scruffy one-nil win and while it was hardly smash and grab, they had to sweat to a earn a crucial win that revives their hopes of automatic qualification. Aaron Ramsey’s 100th senior career goal, from the penalty spot, opened the scoring but Wales also endured their share of hairy moments.</p><p>A 15-second countdown to kick-off was displayed on the big screen at one end of this no-frills stadium within walking distance of the cobbled old town. At that moment Page, who last week acknowledged the external negativity surrounding his team and on the eve of the game did not hide from questions about his future amid mounting scrutiny, could be forgiven for wondering whether this would be the last time. Wales had won one of their pr

<p>Al-Hilal’s 4-3 win over Al-Ittihad proved the big-money strategy is working, though doubts remain over attendances and depth</p><p>Despite all the PR and marketing consultants hired by Saudi Arabia, the Saudi “Clasico”, which featured Al-Ittihad and Al-Hilal, was not, for some reason, rebranded ‘Al Clasico’. Nevertheless, the 1 September clash was quite the way to sign off for the international break. Al-Ittihad, hosts, champions and the so-called people’s club from the Red Sea port of Jeddah, faced Riyadh royalty and took a 3-1 lead only to lose 4-3.</p><p>There was international interest, which was expected given the raft of big-name signings made in the summer, and more quality, which, again, was hardly a surprise. Al-Ittihad, who conceded only 13 goals under Nuno Espírito Santo last season, were cruising before conceding three goals in the space of 11 second-half minutes, with Al-Hilal’s Aleksandar Mitrovic scoring an impressive hat-trick as the blue-shirted away fans did the

<p>Bettina Love believes decades of victimization, brutalization and belittlement of Black students by the US education system should be rectified with $2tn in reparations</p><p>Should Black students be paid reparations for decades of educational mistreatment? In her new book, Punished for Dreaming, the education scholar Bettina Love argues a forceful yes – and estimates the harm to Black students by the US education system could amount to as much as $2tn over the last 40 years.</p><p>That damage, Love says, was not only dealt by uncaring educators such as the high school math teacher who bluntly told her, “you are not college material,” or the elementary school teacher who body-slammed her friend Zook and put her in a chokehold when she was just 11. The harm also came from an alliance of policymakers, philanthropists and entrepreneurs who created the conditions for this neglect – by defunding public schools in order to push self-enriching “reforms”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguard

<p>As the glitter ball returns, the longest serving Strictly judge talks about ruffling feathers, being fearless, his father’s alcoholism, and why he’s always ready to start over again</p><p>It is already way past working hours, yet you can feel the Strictly Come Dancing machine still whirring. At the studios where the BBC dance competition will take place over the next few months, boxes of hairpieces are piled in the corridor, the lights are on around the mirrors in the makeup room, rails of sequinned dresses in frothy chiffon seem to jostle for a writhing body to fill them and is that one of the pro-dancers bouncing up the stairs topless? On the way to Craig Revel Horwood’s dressing room, I get a glimpse of fellow judge Anton Du Beke. He is, as you would expect, wearing a glittery tuxedo. If you have been watching Strictly for any of its 19-year run, it all feels both weirdly familiar and otherworldly.</p><p>At the beginning, Revel Horwood did not think Strictly would take off. “We
