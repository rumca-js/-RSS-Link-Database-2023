<p><a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/09/10/2023/twitter-appears-to-throttle-new-york-times"><ins>According to </ins><em><ins>Semafor</ins></em></a>, data from <em>NewsWhip</em> showed that engagement on public posts linked to the <em>New York Times</em> website has dropped dramatically since late July. This is seemingly a unique issue to the NYT as other news organizations like <em>CNN</em>, the <em>Washington Post</em>, and the <em>BBC </em>have not seen similar dips in engagement.</p><p>According to the report, the New York Times' reach hasn't changed on Facebook and other social media platforms. Additionally, recent tweets by former President Barack Obama that include NYT links saw less engagement when compared to his other tweets. For example, when Obama shared articles about healthcare costs, his posts reached fewer than 800,000 users. Most of his posts reach a minimum of 10 million users.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While it's unclear what exactly is caus

<p>You didn't actually believe all those founder's myths about tech billionaires like Bezos, Jobs and Musk<a href="https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-the-warehouse-alessandro-delfanti-pluto-press-163008791.html"> pulling themselves up by their bootstraps from some suburban American garage</a>, did you? In reality, our corporate kings have been running the same playbook since the 18th century when Lancashire's own Richard Arkwright wrote it. Arkwright is credited with developing a means of forming cotton fully into thread — technically he didn't actually invent or design the machine, but developed the overarching system in which it could be run at scale — and spinning that success into financial fortune. Never mind the fact that his 24-hour production lines were operated by boys as young as seven pulling 13-hour shifts.</p><p>In<a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1

<p>Microsoft <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/09/11/xbox-mastercard/">announced</a> a new Xbox Mastercard today. Cardmembers can earn points on purchases to redeem on games in the Microsoft Store.

The Mastercard will give users one reward point for each dollar spent on everyday purchases. But the incentive grows to five points per dollar spent at the Microsoft Store. In addition, purchases made at some streaming (including Netflix and Disney+) and dining (including Grubhub and DoorDash) services will earn three points per dollar. Reward points are each

<p>What you're looking at is a concept car, but it's also so much more. This is the car that could change everything you've come to expect about acceptable range from an electric car, not to mention raise the bar for visual style and aggression along the way. This is the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-benz-concept-ev-offers-rapid-charging-and-tesla-beating-range-075800456.html">Mercedes-Benz Concept CLA Class</a>.</p><p>The Concept CLA inherits a lot of learnings from the extremely slippery <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-vision-eqxx-first-drive-video-070023887.html"><ins>Vision EQXX</ins></a>, but it's a car that’s a lot more ready for production, and should be a lot more affordable. The current CLA is one of the most affordable Mercedes-Benz cars you can buy in the US, and with any luck this future one won’t break the bank, either.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That’s despite a range that should surpass 400 miles on a charge, plus a wholly new s

<p>Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. is setting the record straight. After <em>Variety</em> reported earlier this week that an AI-generated track echoing the voices of Drake and The Weeknd could be considered for a Grammy Award in songwriting categories, Mason is insisting that’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-ai-generated-fake-drake-and-the-weeknd-track-is-not-eligible-for-a-grammy-200924948.html">not the case</a>.</p><p>In an interview with <em>The New York Times</em> only last week, Mason suggested the track would be “absolutely eligible” as the lyrics a human made the lyrics. On Instagram, the Recording Academy CEO has now clarified that the song will not be eligible.</p><p>“Even though it was written by a human creator, the vocals were not legally obtained, the vocals were not cleared by the label or the artists and the song is not commercially available and because of that, it’s not eligible,” he said. Sorry robots.</p><p>– Mat Smith</p><p>​​<em>You can get these re

Well, the wait is over. The company announced presales for the forthcoming J9+ line of vacuums, and these high-end appliances boast plenty of nifty features for those who absolutely hate manually pushing a vacuum or mop around.</p><p>The J9+ is available in two versions, which is normally the case with modern Roomba devices.
