&#8220;Probable cause on four legs.&#8221; That&#8217;s the nickname for drug dogs, which give cops permission to perform searches just by performing a neat little trick cops call an &#8220;alert.&#8221; What constitutes an &#8220;alert&#8221; is pretty much up to the dog&#8217;s handler, who can claim any movement is the drug dog detecting contraband or (deliberately or [&#8230;]

A few years back we had an article about the “The Green Smoothie Girl” aka Robyn Openshaw, who went on this weird SLAPPy binge of threatening people who left negative reviews of her brand of woo woo nonsense. Apparently since that time, Openshaw went down the unsurprising path of being a COVID anti-vaxxer (natch) and [&#8230;]

The ends aren&#8217;t always supposed to justify the means. And a federal agency that already raised the hackles of defense lawyers around the nation during a CSAM investigation probably shouldn&#8217;t be in this much of hurry to start sending out unsolicited software to unknowing recipients. But that&#8217;s the way things work now. As a result [&#8230;]

So, I already wrote a long post walking through the mostly very good 5th Circuit ruling in the Missouri v. Biden case, in which the court threw out most of the district court judge’s injunction against the government communicating with social media companies and academics. The end result is a very good, straightforward ruling on [&#8230;]

We’re going to go slow on this one, because there’s a lot of background and details and nuance to get into in Friday’s 5th Circuit appeals court ruling in the Missouri v. Biden case that initially resulted in a batshit crazy 4th of July ruling regarding the US government “jawboning” social media companies. The reporting [&#8230;]

We&#8217;ve already noted how the 2021 infrastructure bill aims to spend a whopping $42 billion on broadband deployments via the Broadband Equity and Deployment program (BEAD). We&#8217;ve also noted how big regional monopolies are doing everything in their power to ensure the lion&#8217;s share of that money goes to them, and not smaller ISPs or [&#8230;]
