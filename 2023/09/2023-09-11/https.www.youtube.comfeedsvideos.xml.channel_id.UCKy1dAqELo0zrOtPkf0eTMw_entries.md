Director Shawn Levy has spoken on the upcoming Merc with a Mouth sequel, Deadpool 3. And with it, we know just how far along filming is for the Marvel Studios movie. Speaking to Deadline, the director said, “Like the rest of our industry, or at least large swath of it, we're paused. We're halfway through filming Deadpool, co-starring Wolverine. Our crew and the rest of us are awaiting a fair and equitable deal that ends these strikes and puts this industry, inclusive of our movie, back at work.” The director is referring to the ongoing WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes that’ve put countless movie and television shows on pause until a fair deal is met in Hollywood. The strikes have been going on for months now with no clear end in sight. #Deadpool3 is still slated to release next year, so we’ll see what the future holds for the upcoming #MCU Marvel movie. We also have an update on Five Nights at Freddy’s runtime, as well as some Aquaman 2 news on today’s entertainment fix with Akeem Lawanson.
