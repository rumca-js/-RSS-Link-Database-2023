Speaking to Deadline, the director said, \u201cLike the rest of our industry, or at least large swath of it, we're paused. We're halfway through filming Deadpool, co-starring Wolverine. Our crew and the rest of us are awaiting a fair and equitable deal that ends these strikes and puts this industry, inclusive of our movie, back at work.\u201d The director is referring to the ongoing WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes that\u2019ve put countless movie and television shows on pause until a fair deal is met in Hollywood. The strikes have been going on for months now with no clear end in sight. #Deadpool3 is still slated to release next year, so we\u2019ll see what the future holds for the upcoming #MCU Marvel movie.
