  <p id="1xszpG"><em>Starfield </em>is one of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23855205/starfield-pc-performance-benchmarks-hands-on">most demanding games</a> on PC that we’ve seen recently, with even the RTX 4090 paired with AMD’s latest Ryzen 7800X3D just about hitting 60fps on average at 4K with all the settings maxed out.

## Who is the Apple Watch Ultra really for?

  <p id="coYRMP">When I first saw the Apple Watch Ultra, I wasn’t sure what to make of it. Apple’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1adxM-CjM">sizzle reel</a> had weatherbeaten explorers trekking up snow-capped mountains, running across deserts, and diving into the depths of the ocean. This was an Apple Watch for the intrepid explorer, which arguably few tech journalists swarming the Ultra models at the Steve Jobs Theater were. In fact, I’d contend that most people aren’t hardcore outdoors enthusiasts who need 49mm titanium cases, a sapphire crystal lens, WR100 water resistance, and EN13319 certification for diving.

<p id="q7ASxp">Apple’s product events have always been more than sales pitches — they’re essentially technology entertainment: presentations that run as long as feature films and make bold promises about how technology is changing and why Apple’s new products are (supposedly) the ones leading the charge. The events are undeniably popular. Apple’s last iPhone event, in September 2022, has 31 million views on YouTube alone.</p>

  <p id="aVGZ5V">The Lightning connector really only had two jobs: be tiny and be foolproof. Apple developed the new port for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/9/12/3316830/iphone-5-release-date-specs-features-price-announcement">the iPhone 5</a>, which at the time was simultaneously the largest, thinnest, and lightest iPhone the company had ever made. That made every millimeter of space and milligram of weight matter.
