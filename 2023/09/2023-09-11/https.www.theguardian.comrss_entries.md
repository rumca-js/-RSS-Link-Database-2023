<p>England manager knows he owes much to a fixture which has helped to shape his career – and can get his side back on track</p><p>Gareth Southgate has mentioned his dirty secret previously – how he was a Scotland fan before he was an England fan. And yet when he did so here, in the Hampden Park auditorium, in the buildup to Tuesday night’s showpiece between Scotland and his England team, a celebration of the oldest rivalry in international football, it seemed to carry extra resonance.</p><p>It was out of necessity, of course. And ignorance, Southgate said with a smile. England had not qualified for the 1978 World Cup but Scotland had and the seven-year-old him simply wanted to support a British team. “I kind of followed it through the trauma of Peru and the Netherlands,” Southgate said, firing memories of Scotland’s defeat in the opening group game and the Archie Gemmill-inspired victory in the third that was not enough to see them advance. “They were a British team … I didn’t reali

And, by recent yardsticks of taxpayer subsidy, the reported £75m contribution to the overall £600m investment almost counts as modest.

His second world war satire was that year’s audience award winner before it became the next year’s best adapted screenplay Oscar winner, a result that elevated him to a new level of Hollywood royalty, however deserved that may have been.</p><p>But while Sunday’s premiere saw roars of laughter and cheers of approval from an easily manipulated audience, it’s doubtful that his latest will be able to emulate even a fraction of that success. The film is a shoddily made and strikingly unfunny attempt to tell an interesting story in an uninteresting way.

<p>A spate of attacks has reopened the difficult debate over what should be classed as a dangerous animal</p><p>When the Dangerous Dogs Act was passed in 1991, there was a lot of debate about the justice and enforceability of its terms. The pit bull was one of four banned breeds, but it was defined by its appearance and some criteria were loose, others hard to understand. “Its knee joint should be in the upper third of the dog’s rear leg, and the bones below that should appear light, fine and springy,” was one. Once you have figured out what a springy bone looks like, this could cover an awful lot of dogs. “The dog should have a good depth from the top of head to bottom of jaw and a straight box-like muzzle,” was another, which could describe the staffordshire bull terrier and wipe out the sixth most popular breed in the UK. The law never required any suspect to meet the description perfectly; it makes no mention of ears, colour, height or weight.</p><p>The upshot is that the America

We put it under the flowering elm tree so the little birds would feel protected and hang out there for longer. It’s a few metres from our back door. Most days, when the sun hits that part of the floorboards, our cat Laurie can be found there, lazing in a sunbeam watching the birds through the glass. Sometimes, when they hop closer, she will sit up and make little chattering noises. It’s cat TV: enriching for her, safe for the oblivious birds.</p><p>I wish I could say we’d done it for the birds’ sake.

That all changed in the summer of 1981 with the release of the all-conquering Donkey Kong (designed by a young Shigeru Miyamoto), which went on to become one of the bestselling arcade games of all time, as well as marking the debut of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/super-mario">Mario</a>.</p><p>But that same year, Miyamoto worked with director Genyo Takeda on an arcade game that has since been all but forgotten. Sky Skipper featured giant gorillas, just like Donkey Kong, but here the player was piloting a biplane and collecting anthropomorphic playing cards.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/sep/11/the-quest-for-sky-skipper-the-rarest-nintendo-arc

<p>These two striking, improvisatory remasters by Kira Muratova resemble early Polanski, and establish the late director as a fiercely intelligent auteur</p><p>Two complex, elusive and demanding films by the late Moldovan-born, Ukrainian-based director Kira Muratova have now been digitally remastered and rereleased: Brief Encounters (1967) (★★★★★) and The Long Farewell (1971) (★★★★★). The latter was not initially released until much later, owing at least partly to the continuous suspicion Muratova’s distinctive, prose-poetic film language faced from the Soviet authorities.</p><p>The question of the director’s neglect in film history has been much discussed, and maybe it is also marginally unfortunate that the titles of these films are easily confused with two very well-known English-language movies.

The word barley means “what is cultivated”, and this grain is one of the oldest known to man; it is also vitamin- and mineral-rich, and has a high fibre content compared with other wholegrains. Today’s fritters are very quick to make, combining grated beetroot and caraway with cooked barley; smoked fish and dill are my favourite topping for them, but go with whatever takes your fancy. Cooking barley like rice, risotto-style, is a bit more time-consuming, but it can be the base for so many meals and, like so many things, is vastly improved by the ad

My mother swears it was my brother who did this.</p><p>This kind of confusion is common in families. As stories are told and retold, they take on a life of their own. Details fade and change. It becomes easy to swap one child for another, or to confuse a familiar tale with a personal memory.

<p>Kwan’s 2001 film was the strongest in a wave of gay-themed Chinese films and remains a poignant work that tugs at audience heartstrings</p><p>At the start of Stanley Kwan’s masterly 2001 melodrama, entrepreneur Chen Handong (Hu Jun) thinks back to the 1980s and to the night he met young architecture student Lan Yu (Liu Ye), freshly arrived in Beijing from the country and ripe for mentoring and more. The older man warns his toy boy not to get attached. “When two people know each other too well, it’s time to separate,” he says – then signally fails to heed his own advice. He showers Lan Yu with gifts, even buying him a villa, but external events exert unreasonable pressures on them. Handong feels obliged to marry a woman, while Lan Yu joins the protests in Tiananmen Square. The massacre may be reduced here to noises off but its inclusion helps explain, along with the gay content (which earned the lead actors verbal warnings from the authorities), why the picture was shot on the sly.

<p>Saied Dai’s painting captures the former PM’s sternness and stoicism, her failure and her femininity. But it also raises questions about how artists use male traits to depict female leaders</p><p>Imagine a leader. What do you see? How are they presented? What are they wearing? Are they up on a platform or down on the ground? In uniform or in a dress? Are they regal and smart? Full frontal or turned to the side? If it’s a woman, what comes to mind? Last week, Theresa May’s official portrait, by the Persian-born British-based painter Saied Dai, was unveiled. I don’t know what I was expecting – but it definitely wasn’t this. At first glance, I found her appearance cold and androgynous, the style evoking that of wartime with its muddying palette and sharp angular shapes. The more I sat with it, the more I realised how good a painting it was, with incredible psychological insight into its subject and the times in which we are living.</p><p>I was in my early 20s when May was leader.

<p>Director Bakhtyar Khudojnazarov’s debut feature about two young brothers attempting to find their errant father is a deeply humane story about family and responsibility</p><p>There’s a marvellous freshness and gentleness to this 1991 movie, a little like early Truffaut, by Tajik-Russian director Bakhtyar Khudojnazarov who achieved a wider festival prestige later in the 90s for his comedies Kosh Ba Kosh and Luna Papa. This film, Bratan or “Little Brother”, was in fact his debut, released when he was just 26 years old. Filmed in a seductive and luminous monochrome, it is a road movie, or rather a rail movie, that apparently makes quasi-documentary use of the non-professional people and places found along the way.</p><p>Two brothers, one about 16 and the other perhaps nine or ten, are living with their grandmother in a remote Tajik town: they are Farukh (Firus Sasaliyev) and Azamat, nicknamed “Pancake” (Timur Tursunov). The older boy seems to be drifting into petty crime: he and his

It dates back to the seventh century, and, like so much of historic Cairo, has always existed in an almost dizzying proximity with modernity. Billboards, construction and heavy traffic rub shoulders with the silent tombs of intricate mosaics, ancient wooden doors and hallowed spaces of mourning and remembrance.

She longs for her home town of Xingtai, a small city in Hebei province, where school fees are a fraction of what they are in Beijing, and where life is “peaceful and relaxed and happy”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/11/have-we
