If nothing else, Deion Sanders' is good for content. Also, as a side note, Google has to do a better job deciphering the difference between Colorado and Colorado State.  When someone attempts to fact-check his tweet and asks \"Is Deion the coach of Colorado State,\" the answer from Google should be \"no.\" Just saying.</p><p>Colorado upset TCU in the opening game. If you're like me and have only been a college football fan for a couple of weeks, Colorado went 1-11 the year before and TCU played in the National Championship. When you hear Coach Prime's pregame speech to the team, TCU is lucky the Buffaloes didn't rip a lineman's arms off and beat the tight end with them.</p><p>\"That man next to you is a miracle.
