Gauff’s newest coach, Brad Gilbert, suggested that it was time for her to hit with more spin, to prioritise consistency and initiate longer points.</p><p>But Gauff had already politely asked her team to stop advising her and in one of the most important moments of her season, she took matters into her own hands. Instead of patiently waiting from behind the baseline as instructed, she forced her way inside it and attacked relentlessly. After a tense, physical and fascinating generational battle, Gauff emerged as the victor over Wozniacki, winning 6-3, 3-6, 6-1 to return to the quarter-finals of the US Open.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sp

<p><strong>Venice film festival:</strong> A courtroom drama based on events in Herman Wouk’s second world war novel The Caine Mutiny, Friedkin leaves us with a valuable last effort</p><p>The ghosts of film history can be seen all over Venice, the city where Dirk Bogarde sat down in a deck-chair and died and Donald Sutherland was bewitched by the sight of a red raincoat. One spies their faces on black-and-white stills inside the main festival site and adorning celebratory posters positioned around town.

<p><strong>Venice film festival:</strong> Michael Fassbender is perfect in the main role of a yoga-loving assassin who discourses on everything from morality to the Smiths</p><p>David Fincher’s horribly addictive samurai procedural, adapted by Andrew Kevin Walker from the graphic novel by Alexis Nolent, stars Michael Fassbender as the un-named titular hitman: an ascetic who in the movie’s sensationally low-key opening sequence tells us about dealing with the job’s biggest challenge: boredom. He internally monologues on this subject, and many others, including his views on the amorality of the universe and the music of the Smiths, while sitting high up in a rented WeWork office space with his long-range rifle, next to a five-star Paris hotel, waiting, waiting, waiting, for the VIP guest to show up in the suite opposite and get a bullet in the head.</p><p>But despite the killer’s cool and pitiless rigour, his elaborate discipline and impressive yoga postures, something goes terribly wr

<p><strong>Venice film festival:</strong> Disaster appears imminent as Seydoux and an impressive George MacKay meet across three different eras in what maybe Bertrand Bonello’s best movie yet</p><p>Bertrand Bonello’s new film is a vast unsettling dream of the future and the past; it stars Léa Seydoux, whose poise, creamy moue of discontent and gorgeous fashion sense are all part of the film’s enigma. The Beast is audacious and traumatisingly sexual, maybe Bonello’s best movie yet (and I have been agnostic about his work). It’s rich, strange, with a chilly indifference to your viewing comfort and a tremor of imminent disaster.</p><p>It is a film about the shock of the new, the realisation that technology is on the point of modifying and even abolishing humanity without our consent; it invites us to test our thumb on the cutting edge of modernity and draw blood. Director and co-writer Bonello has been loosely inspired by Henry James’s story The Beast in the Jungle from 1903 about a man

<p>A sensation in France, this tale of a besotted wife who demands devotion from her husband has been likened to Patricia Highsmith and Gone Girl</p><p>A week may be a long time in politics but it can feel longer still in a tempestuous marriage. Superficially, the couple at the centre of Maud Ventura’s compulsively disquieting debut embody domestic bliss: they have good looks and professional success, two children and an elegant home. Yet over the course of just seven days, the novel’s besotted narrator convinces herself that her spouse of 13 years is variously having an affair, utterly devoted to her and poised to demand a divorce. The prologue hints at a looming crisis, but what maintains the suspense is the heroine’s combination of subjugation and vengeful empowerment (the secret notebook in which she logs her husband’s misdemeanours feels like payback for every fairytale women have been fed about romantic love). There’s simply no way of telling how far she’ll go, and her increasi

<p>This kind of behavior is a way to contradict women’s achievements, and knock them down</p><p>It was a moment of superlative achievement for Jenni Hermoso, the prolific scorer on Spain’s women’s national team. The 2023 tournament was Hermoso’s third World Cup – and, at 33, it may well have been her last. But it was the first Women’s World Cup she had won: in fact, the first Spain ever won. Sweaty and exhilarated, Hermoso joined her teammates after the match for a medal ceremony, a moment that for any athlete would mark the pinnacle of her career. And then Luis Rubiales, a Spanish soccer official, decided to make the moment about him. He grabbed Hermoso, in front of television cameras and thousands of onlookers, and forced his mouth on hers.</p><p>Hermoso, in that moment, was demeaned and downgraded by Rubiales, denied her triumph, stripped of her status, and shown not as the victorious athlete that she was, but as a woman, subject to men’s violence and whims. It was supposed to be

<p>The late travel writer and novelist’s study of his dad – brave soldier, man of the cloth but also snob and antisemite – offers a beautifully written portrait rather than judgment</p><p>Jonathan Raban completed this, his last testament, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/18/jonathan-raban-travel-writer-and-novelist-dies-aged-80">just before he died</a>, aged 80, in January. As well as a leave-taking, it offers a belated salute to a father from his son. The title echoes the great Edmund Gosse memoir of 1907, a reckoning of filial relations that shocked its Edwardian readership and broached a new candour in life-writing. This new <em>Father and Son</em> will cause nothing like the sensation that Gosse’s did, though it does teasingly hint at the ambiguous blessing of a father who doubles as a man of the cloth.</p><p>A British exile in Seattle since 1990, Raban was one of those writers who stood at an angle to his native land.

A Google search, however, revealed that Lanzarote not only has a very famous active volcano, it owes its entire landscape to volcanic activity and is ‘known around the world as the Island of Volcanoes.’</p><p>We, my wife’s parents, siblings and their kids, were staying at a very swish resort near Playa Blanca, a megalithic warren of square white buildings that sprawled down to the sea.

A famous actor known for their openness and jollity might greet you four hours into their film junket with a headache and growling list of notes on the conduct of your newspaper. They might be exhausted after fielding six previous interviewers’ questions about their divorce, and unwilling or unable to perform warmth for even one more journalist. Even with decent wifi, Zoom might lead to a lack of connection. Or they might simply not like the interview process, admittedly a deeply weird experience for everyone involved, where two strangers meet in a hotel room and are forced to immediately talk about, for example, the death of the prettier one’s father.</p><p>Even when it works, you never really get to know who a person is – at best you get to know who they want to be.

He was one of the few journalists on the ground to witness the mass arrests of Allende supporters and book burnings in the aftermath of General Augusto Pinochet’s CIA-backed coup.

Even on the first day back to school I would be delirious at the scent of my new pencil case, protractor, compass… (I still ended up being useless at geometry but that’s not the point). Anyway, beauty could take a cue from this ethos. September is a great time to get a new makeup bag (or at least clean the one you have with gusto) and fill it with fresh new basics – a lipstick, concealer, blush, brow gel and some mascara. There.

Sub-Saharan Africa has suffered an alarming spate of military takeovers since 2020<p>Army general Brice Clotaire Oligui Nguema, the self-declared new leader of the west African state of Gabon, has promised “to turn the page” on over half a century of misrule by the family of Ali Bongo Ondimba, the president he deposed last week.

If anything, this seems like a place for red wines, and powerful ones at that, not least after this year’s waves of infernal heat. That white grapes proliferate is in large part down to their use in some of the area’s grape-based specialities: brandy, sweet wines and, in Andalusia, the fortified wines of sherry and montilla. In fact sherry, in its lightest, driest incarnations, manzanilla and fino, is one of Spain’s greatest white wine styles, since even after fortification these wines are only about 15% abv.

Five men and five women looking for love are placed in close proximity and given group tasks that will allow them to get to know each other and, hopefully, strike sparks that can be fanned
