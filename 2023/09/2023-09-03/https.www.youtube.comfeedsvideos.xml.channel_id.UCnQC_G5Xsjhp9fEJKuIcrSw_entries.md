Christopher Rufo is a writer, filmmaker, and Senior Fellow and Director of the Initiative on Critical Race Theory at the Manhattan Institute. His writings explore many issues such as gender ideology, identity politics, addiction, crime, and the decline of American cities. In this episode, we discuss how to create a free society through duty and responsibility and how Leftist ideology has evolved and planted itself into our social institutions. Plus, we delve into how Chris transitioned from a young Leftist to a force for good in the conservative movement.
