This week on Breakout, we discuss Lies of P, which is yet another fantastic game in a wave of great games over the past few weeks.

Featuring Nick Calandra, Marty Sliva, and KC Nwosu, the freeform podcast dives into a bit of our daily lives, the latest games, movies, tv shows and books, the occasional craft beer review and random topics we find interesting.
