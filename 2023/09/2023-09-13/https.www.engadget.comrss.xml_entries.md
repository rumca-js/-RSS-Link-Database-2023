Bethesda says it specifically targets Xbox Series X/S glitches and adds various performance improvements to reduce crashes and improve frame rates.

<p>Amazon is <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/small-business/amazon-sellers-generative-ai-tool">launching</a> a new AI tool that generates product listings for sellers. The feature uses a large language model (LLM) “trained on large amounts of data” to make it faster and simpler for vendors to describe their products. The company describes the tool as distilling the “significant work” of creating titles, bullet points and descriptions down to “just one step.”</p><p>Amazon says its Generative Listing Content tool only requires sellers to provide a brief product description in a few words or sentences. From there, it will “generate high-quality content for their review” — including a title, product description and bullet points — which sellers can peruse before refining or submitting as is. The company says many sellers have already tested the tool during the last few months, and their feedback indicates most of them use the generated content directly

The dashboard-based LED screen curves toward the driver in a “single, continuous screen” that spans the entire viewing area.</p><p>Like most in-car displays, this is a customizable user interface that you can access in a number of different ways. Cadillac has partnered up with Google, so many of the company’s apps are built-in to the display, like Google Assistant and Google Maps. This allows for live traffic updates, podcasts, music streaming, hands-free communication and more. The inclusion of Google Play lets you shop around for all kinds of apps to help pass the time during that annoying commute.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="

<p>When I saw one of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-05-samsung-qled-49-inch-monitor.html">first 49-inch ultrawide monitors from Samsung</a> five years ago, I found it to be a curious creation. I was no stranger to the world of ultrawides, but that screen was a bit much. It was too unwieldy, and its odd resolution wasn't tall enough for my tastes. Since then, though, the 49-inch category has evolved: They're cheaper, have newer display technology and are better equipped for gaming. Sure, you'll still need to have <em>a lot</em> of room on your desk (or a very sturdy mounting arm), but these days they could actually be considered practical.</p><p>LG's 49-inch Curved UltraGear is a prime example of how much things have changed. Starting at $1,300, it offers 49-inches of glorious screen space with a sharp 5,120 by 1,440 resolution; an ultra-fast 240Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time; and AMD FreeSync Premium support. It's LG's largest and most immersive gaming monitor y

<p>The perfect hybrid machine that’s just as good a tablet as it is a traditional laptop still doesn’t exist. But throughout last year, companies like Microsoft, Apple and Google continued to improve their operating systems for machines that do double duty. Windows 11 has features that make it friendlier for multi-screen devices, while Android has been better optimized for larger displays. Plus, with the rise of ARM-based chips for laptops, especially Apple’s impressive M series, prospects for a powerful 2-in-1 with a vast touch-friendly app ecosystem is at an all-time high.</p><p>Even the best 2-in-1 laptops still have their limits, of course. Since they’re smaller than proper laptops, they tend to have less-powerful processors. Keyboards are often less sturdy, with condensed layouts and shallower travel. Plus, they’re almost always tablets first, leaving you to buy a keyboard case separately. (And those ain’t cheap!) So, you can’t always assume the advertised price is what you’ll a

<p>Building your first custom mechanical keyboard can be intimidating. Between all the parts and terminology involved, it’s hard to know where to start. Thankfully, it’s also never been easier to jump into the hobby. For this guide, I interviewed two YouTube creators — Brian Philips of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@badseedtech">BadSeed Tech</a> fame and Alexander <a href="https://www.alexotos.com/">‘Alexotos</a>’ Medeot.

Note that this guide isn’t meant to be exhaustive; instead, it’s designed to highlight features newbies should look for when shopping for their first custom keyboard.</p><h2>The basics</h2><p>At its most basic, building a custom keyboard involves buying a case, printed circuit board (PCB), plate, mechanical switches and keycaps, and then assembling all those parts together to make something you can type on. Depending on how ambitious you want to get, you can source all those co

<p>Farewell Lightning cable. I will miss you when I inevitably get rid of all my cables, only to forget my MacBook wireless keyboard and trackpad still need you.

Most people might be surprised that the streaming giant is still even renting DVDs, but if you're one of its subscribers who'll be sad to see the service go, there's now another rent-by-mail option you can use anywhere you are in the US. Scarecrow, the largest independent video store in the US, has <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.polygon.com/23870135/scarecrow-rare-movie-rental-mail-united-states-netflix">launched</a> its own <a href="https://scarecrowvideo.org/rent-by-mail">rent-by-mail service</a> that will <a href="https://www.iconvsicon.com/2023/09/12/scarecrow-video-launches-new-rental-website-with-over-120k-physical-media-titles-available-to-film-fans-nationwide/">send DVDs and Blu-ray discs</a> straight to your door.&nbsp;<

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/jack-dorsey-backed-bluesky-is-having-a-moment-133039184.html">Bluesky</a>, one of the most notable alternatives to the platform formerly known as Twitter, has just hit a million users. That's admittedly tiny compared to the number of users on major social networks, but it's a big deal for a service that remains inaccessible to most people until today. Bluesky team member Rose Wang, who has announced the milestone on X, told <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/12/bluesky-officially-hits-1-million-users/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> that the service's app reached a million downloads in July. However, those interested in getting in on the action at Bluesky will have to secure invite codes to log in, and it's only now that enough people were able to create accounts for the social network to be able to announce that it has reached 1 million users.&nbsp;</p><div id="724a2570c27f4a46858b608ef19bdb9c"><blockquote class="twitter-t

<p></p><p>In the world of console video games, Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo stand as titans. For PC gamers, however, Valve reigns supreme.

Today marks Steam's 20th anniversary.</p><p>Valve is celebrating by slashing prices on its self-published games, offering most of its catalog for 90 percent off, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-23-half-life-alyx-review-valve-vr.html">except <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em></a>.

It's a fun read that offers users the chance to buy the &quot;Top Games&quot; from key years in the platform's history, punctuating footnotes about the very first Steam Sale with a chance to buy the original <em>Portal </em>for just $0.99.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
