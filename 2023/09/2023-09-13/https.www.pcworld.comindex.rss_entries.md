And on the list are two PC-specific features: support for Nvidia&rsquo;s DLSS upscaling technology and ultrawide monitors. To sweeten the pot, Bethesda and Nvidia just added <em>Starfield</em> support to the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/630335/geforce-now-review.html">GeForce Now cloud gaming service</a>.</p>

<p>No matter how much experience you have with Microsoft&rsquo;s Windows, it can still be improved by turning to software and tools that can make the operating system that much better.</p>



<p>Take Windows 11, for example: When Microsoft introduced it with extremely strict system requirements in autumn 2021, it was only a matter of time before those barriers could be circumvented. </p>



<p>In order to install the new operating system on older PCs, the registry first had to be changed manually. Later, this could be simplified with a batch file, and now even that is superfluous thanks to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://rufus.ie/en/&amp;xcust=2-1-2010943-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Rufus</a>, a small tool for creating bootable USB sticks.

<p>In the eighties, computer processors became faster and faster, while memory access times stagnated and hindered additional performance increases. Something had to be done to speed up memory access and make the whole system work more efficiently. </p>



<p>The discrepancy between computational and memory speed ultimately led to the development of processor cache. Basically, the cache is a fast type of memory. It contains a small area of memory with the instructions that the computer will most likely need next if it is to perform certain tasks. </p>



<p>The system loads this information into the cache using complex algorithms. The main purpose of a cache system is to ensure that the processor has immediate and instant access to the data it needs in the right order.</p>

<p>A RAM slot, also known as a RAM socket, is a long, slim slot on the motherboard of a PC. This allows a RAM module of varying speeds and capacities to be accommodated. Most motherboards have either two or four of these memory banks. Each slot has a maximum RAM capacity, usually between 8 and 32 gigabytes depending on your CPU and motherboard combination.</p>



<p>The RAM slots on modern motherboards are numbered. This way you know which slots to insert the memory modules into. Often they are also colored differently and sometimes slightly offset from each other. Both help you to place the modules correctly according to the motherboard manufacturer&rsquo;s specifications.</p>



<p>In addition, RAM slots differ between laptops and desktop computers. Notebooks mostly use SODIMM modules, which are shorter and smaller than the standard desktop DIMM variants. Most la

<p>Operating systems need at least a minimum of maintenance to run properly over the long term. While some important tools are already included from Microsoft, many professionals want or need more powerful and useful tools to help them when using Windows systems.</p>



<p>Thankfully, Microsoft provides numerous tools free of charge that help with analysis, maintenance, and troubleshooting. Some of these tools are useful for everyone in everyday use, while others are only needed in special situations.</p>



<p>There are several reasons why the tools are not included as standard Windows equipment. Due to the sheer number of different functions, the need for these specific tools is often not obvious at first glance, and sometimes the prerequisites for using the tools have to be created first.
