<p>Jump into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mortal-kombat-1/">Mortal Kombat 1</a> and you'll find a roster of more than 20 fighters and Kameos spanning three decades of Mortal Kombat history to choose from. But only one of them, Havik, is locked to begin the game. There's no hint as to how you'll unlock him, but don't fret; the solution is actually rather easy, just not very quick. Here's how to unlock Havik in Mortal Kombat 1.</p><h2>Mortal Kombat 1 Havik unlock</h2><p>To unlock Havik, you need to only perform one task, though that task is hours long: You'll need to <strong>beat the main story</strong> (Kampaign?) mode.

<p>On paper, Like A Dragon Gaiden has a few things going against it, the largest being that it has the daunting task of justifying Kiryu's return as a protagonist following what <em>seemed </em>like his final adventure. This is especially the case since Ichiban, the series' new lead, has largely been embraced by the series' fans. It sets developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, and Kiryu, at a disadvantage. But if there's one thing Kazuma Kiryu is, it's resolute.</p><p dir="ltr">However, after playing about 20 minutes of Like A Dragon Gaiden, I remain unsure if sheer determination is enough. Granted, the portion of the game I played through was limited to one area and shied away from digging into any of the story elements the series is well-known for. I can't make a definitive call on the game just yet, although with that said, what I did experience was a lot of fun--and also deeply embarrassing, but more on that later.</p><p dir="ltr">Like A Dragon Gaiden picks up after the events of Yakuza

As such, we've compiled a list of the duties alongside their solutions below.</p><p>These new Star Path Duties ask you to perform vague tasks like "make conversation with a very speedy princess" or "give different villagers a sugar rush," but since these are open to interpretation, they can get tricky, even if you've faithfully stayed up to date on all things Disney Dreamlight Valley over the past year.</p><h2>All Haunted Holiday Star Path Duties and how to complete them</h2><p>Six of these duties will be available to you at any one time.

<p>Fans are just one day away from the anticipated Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom trailer dropping this Thursday, but director James Wan wants to set a few things straight about the production. It's been five years since the first Aquaman movie--starring Jason Momoa donning the golden scales of the Atlantian hero--became the first DC movie to cross that $1 billion mark, but a lot of things have happened internally as well. We've seen the removal of Walter Hamada, and the ascension of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-gunn-will-co-lead-dc-studios-steering-upcoming-dceu-movies-shows-and-cartoons/1100-6508620/">James Gunn and Peter Safran as co-heads of DC Films</a> and have a long-term plan in store, with Momoa's Aquaman no longer having a place among that schedule.</p><p>Wan recently spoke to <a href="https://ew.com/movies/aquaman-2-james-wan-on-dcu-changes-amber-heard-reshoots/?utm_campaign=entertainmentweekly_entertainmentweekly&amp;utm_content=new&amp;utm_medium=social

We come to theaters to scream, to beg, to play... that indescribable feeling you get when the lights flicker on and off and your calls for mercy go unanswered," he says. "And you wake up chained, in dirty warehouse, somehow still breathing, blood-soaked blades on a huge silver screen. Somehow, self-amputation feels good in a place like this."</p><div>          </div><p>Saw X releases in theaters on September 29, and it brings back Tobin Bell as John Kramer.

<p>Lies of P is the bizarre Frankenstein hybrid of Pinocchio and Bloodborne. Set in a gothic, dark fantasy world, you battle as a warrior Pinocchio, customize his puppet abilities, and tell lies (or truths) that will determine his ultimate fate.</p><p>On average, reviews of Lies of P are fairly positive. They cite the game's obvious Bloodborne inspiration as a key strength, rather than a legacy the game fails to live up to. While Lies of P doesn't hit the heights of From Soft classics, or meaningfully diverge from them, it does stand shoulder to shoulder with souls past, according to most reviews. Common criticisms include the game's unyielding devotion to the aesthetics and style of Bloodborne, inconsistent dodging and parrying mechanics, as well as customization systems that feel superfluous rather than essential. The narrative is either far too thin or surprisingly pointed and poignant, depending on who you ask.</p><p>Reviewer Richard Wakeling wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://

<p dir="ltr">There's no shortage of Souls-likes vying for our attention, but only one can claim to put a dark and twisted spin on the everlasting story of Pinocchio. Developed by South Korean studio Neowiz Games, Lies of P presents a very loose retelling of Italian author Carlo Collodi's 1883 novel The Adventures of Pinocchio. This grim reimagining, combined with a striking Belle Epoque-infused setting, ensures that Lies of P's aesthetic stands apart from other Souls-likes, including From Software's own. Bloodborne is still a clear inspiration, as its tonal atmosphere and combat design call to mind the cosmic horror masterpiece, leading to it feeling overly derivative at times. Still, Neowiz also implements just enough originality for Lies of P to eke out its own identity, even if it's as thin as a puppet string.</p><p dir="ltr">The story sees you take on the role of P, a lifelike puppet who wakes up amidst the carnage of a puppet-led invasion of the fictional city of Krat.

<p> A new tell-all biography about Elon Musk written by author Walter Isaacson may be telling a little too much, including the possibility that Musk engaged in sexy Overwatch roleplay with ex Amber Heard. After Musk told her that she reminded him of Overwatch healer Mercy, Heard reportedly spent two months putting together a cosplay she could wear for him, as picked up by <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-amber-heard-machete-kills-overwatch-mercy-1850831227">Kotaku</a>.</p><p>Elon Musk dated Amber Heard on and off through 2017 and 2018, reportedly first taking interest in the actress as early as 2013 after seeing her in Machete Kills. The cosplay anecdote took place in 2017, after Musk flew out to Australia to see Heard while she was filming Aquaman. There, Musk told her she reminded him of Mercy, who was his favorite Overwatch character, and "she spent two months designing and commissioning a head-to-toe costume so she could role-play for him."</p><p>Speaking to Isaacson for the
