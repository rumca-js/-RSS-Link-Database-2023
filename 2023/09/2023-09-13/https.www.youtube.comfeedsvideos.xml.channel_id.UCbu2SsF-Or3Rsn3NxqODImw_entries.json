The combat has variety and feels good, while the game's environments ooze in atmosphere.\nGameSpot's Richard Wakeling had a chance to check out the game, and this is his review of Lies of P. Lies of P is set to release September 19, 2023.\n\n#gaming #liesofp #gamespot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8_5p-9_3U8", "date_published": "2023-09-13T15:00:17+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GameSpot", "album": "GameSpot", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/D8_5p-9_3U8/hqdefault.jpg"}]
