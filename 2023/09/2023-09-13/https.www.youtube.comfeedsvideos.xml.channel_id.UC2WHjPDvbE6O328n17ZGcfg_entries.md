And to understand BSD, you must understand these early days of Unix. In that, although it was proprietary, the earliest distributions of Unix included the source code, allowing researchers at universities to modify and extend Unix. The operating system arrived at Berkeley in 1974, at the request of computer science professor Bob Fabry, a Symposium on Operating Systems Principles committee member, where Unix was first presented. BSD came to life as a variant of Unix in the late 1970s by a team of pro
