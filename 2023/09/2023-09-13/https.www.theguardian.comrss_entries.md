<p>This is a cudgel to try to create the false impression that Biden’s misdeeds, if any, are equal to Donald Trump’s</p><p>When the House speaker, Kevin McCarthy, announced an impeachment inquiry into President Biden on Tuesday, he subverted the normal procedures for doing so.

<p>Ambitious goal for Los Teros is to qualify automatically for Australia in 2027 by finishing third in their pool in France</p><p>Four years ago the motto was “shock the world”. And they did, beating Fiji 30-27 for one of the bigger Rugby World Cup surprise results. This time around the Uruguayanteam, better know as “Los Teros”, get their tournament underway against hosts France on Thursday night with a more ambitious goal: “make history”.</p><p>By history they mean qualifying automatically for the 2027 Rugby World Cup, and to achieve it they will need to finish third in Pool A. It is a big goal in a tough group because it means winning two games: against Namibia – where they are favourites - and against Italy, who although historically are the least powerful force in the Six Nations, are still one of the top 10 teams in quality of competition and budget. The goal is so clearly marked that Uruguay’s coach, Esteban Meneses, considers the match against France as the team’s preparation

<p>Lid up or down? Flush every time? Bleach or bathroom cleaner? Your approach can help keep your health and the planet from going down the pan</p><p>How do you flush the toilet? Hopefully it wouldn’t be too much to presume that, after finishing up important bathroom business, you locate a button or handle and press it. But, according to research, the answer might be more complicated. By now we’re all well aware of the fact that, if bathrooms are a breeding ground for bacteria, the loo is their epicentre. On average, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-4379182/Millions-bacteria-lurking-bathroom.html">a toilet basin contains 3.2 million bacteria per square-inch</a>, rivalled only by the toothbrush holder.

<p>Maya Hawke makes for an unconvincing Flannery O’Connor in an obvious, misfiring drama that takes big creative swings but mostly misses</p><p>Flannery O’Connor populated her writing with smart, cynical southerners taking devilish pleasure in puncturing post-Confederate false pieties, though they’re often taken off guard by their enduring Christian credulities bred from birth – in other words, people much like O’Connor herself.</p><p>Ethan Hawke’s latest directorial outing Wildcat, which taps his daughter Maya to portray the author as she returns to her Georgia home, literalizes this connection with flights of fiction taking us inside her short stories. In text-within-a-text renderings of Good Country People and Everything That Rises Must Converge, Maya plays Flannery playing her stand-ins, and every small-minded housewife becomes her maddening mother (Laura Linney). Though Ethan’s fandom for a literary genius comes across loud and clear, he’s ultimately doing a disservice to her pr

<p>From Pulisic to Messi via Ramadani and more – a selection of moves that were good business all round</p><p>Todd Boehly has now poured more than £1bn into Chelsea, but it wasn’t just their big spending that caught the eye this summer. Boehly conducted a fire sale of unwanted first-team players; several went to Saudi Arabia, while Christian Pulisic and Ruben Loftus-Cheek joined Milan. Signed for £57.6m from Dortmund in 2019, Pulisic was sold for a maximum €22m (£18.9m) – this figure feels at least £10m short. Given the <em>Rossoneri’s</em> desire to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/07/captain-america-redux-why-milan-need-christian-pulisic-on-and-off-the-pitch">develop their brand in the US</a>, his presence alone could be worth the cut-price fee.

<p>One of TV’s all-time best casts, an astonishingly high laugh-rate, and pioneering plots about inequality made the series a comedy landmark. Hard to believe this joy of a show is a decade old</p><p>There is no escaping the fact that the people in Michael Schur’s sitcoms are adorable. First and foremost, shows such as The Good Place, Parks and Recreation and the US Office are very, very funny – but they are also populated by characters who care for each other. Jokes rarely arrive cruelly, cheaply, or at the expense of punchbag characters or specific groups. Relationships form and – shockingly – remain loving and stable with no splits thrown in for added brouhaha. Characters grow, enjoy arcs, evolve. These are people you might actually like to have in your corner. And 10 years ago, Schur co-created perhaps the most consistently kind and relentlessly funny of all of them.</p><p>Brooklyn Nine-Nine arrived on Fox in the US on 17 September 2013, and was initially regarded as a vehicle fo

Nonetheless he pulls Mary Lin Elementary into a constellation that includes schools and universities that have healing spaces, affinity and advocacy groups – some of them just sound like workshops – based on race, and concludes: “In place of universalism, parts of the American mainstream are quickly adopting a form of progressive separatism.”</p><p>It’s a terrific introduction in the sense that it distils Mounk’s intellectual methodology: accusation slides effortlessly into fact; events are yoked together o

She gets paid a lot of attention, but she wants more. Parrots are clever and social. Vettese says: “She needs to be entertained all the time, otherwise she really is suffering.” He sees a possible different life for her: “She could be living with her friends and family in a forest, very happy – but she’s not, and that’s unfair to her.”</p><p>If that sounds sensible, but you don’t see what it has to do with the fluffy, well-exercised and frequently fed love of your life at home, bear with me.

<p>This lively sequel to Orwell’s farmyard satire skewers the dysfunction of the past decade, from sleaze and xenophobia to the pandemic and fake news</p><p>The past decade in world politics offers plenty of easy opportunities to invoke George Orwell. But writing a sequel to Animal Farm, a book that exemplifies Italo Calvino’s definition of a classic – that we don’t need to have read it to know it – is a riskier undertaking. In Beasts of England, Adam Biles has updated and retooled Animal Farm for today, and in this clever, resourceful and at times painful novel, the risk pays off.</p><p>Orwell’s 1945 fable was about totalitarianism in other countries and other political systems. Beasts of England is unmistakably about England now. It takes its title from Animal Farm’s revolutionary song – “Rings shall vanish from our noses / And the harness from our back” – before it was outlawed by a tyrannical regime. Though it evokes the original’s characters and backstory, Beasts of England is v

But at least on paper I was able to finish the project – and keep her memory alive</p><p>In 2017, my wife, Julian, and I were having dinner with friends when the conversation turned to same-sex marriage. “Not a problem any more, right?” one said, convinced that there were now equal rights for all. Over lentil stew, we had to tell them that, at the time, gay couples could get married in only 22 countries; to this day, homosexuality is criminalised in 64 and carries a possible or definite death sentence in 11.</p><p>As the conversation went from inequality to the latest <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/sep/23/kara-walker-turbine-hall-tate-modern-racially-charged" title="">Kara Walker</a> exhibition, I started thinking: how could we get those numbers out there?

I carefully picked my first jobs to put me on the path toward a lifelong surgical career.

In my first year I won the Welsh Surgeons junior gold medal prize for research I had nervously presented at a large conference. I was elated.</p><p>But, when I got home from that conference, I kept hearing comments familiar to every woman working in surgery: “Women can’t be surgeons, they aren’t strong enough, you won’t survive, how are you going to have kids?” It starts from the minute you consider stepping into surgery until the day of retirement.

<p>Young people are growing up online, just a few clicks away from explicit content. As part of a theatre project, I asked them a simple question - what do you think about it?</p><p>Between 2016 and 2022, I spoke to around 10,000 children and young people aged between six and 22 about the impact of pornography on their lives. These children were from right across the UK and a range of backgrounds. I met children in classrooms, youth theatres and clubs; I got in my car and travelled to Dundee,Cornwall, Derby, Pembrokeshire and Newcastle.</p><p>I am a theatre director and maker and undertook this research as part of the creation of two new musicals: Why is the Sky Blue? (Southwark Playhouse) and You don’t need to make a Big Song and Dance out of it (National Theatre Connections Festival); made with my brilliant collaborators Matt Regan and Shireen Mula, and produced by Tackroom.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/sep/13/adults-are-terrified-of-talking-to-us-about-it-

<p>Financial peril looms as Wrexham FC chase promotion again in a series that is acutely sensitive to working-class life. Even if it does briefly get a tad silly over royalty</p><p>Outside the Racecourse Ground, the crowd scene before a Wrexham FC home game in the National League is out of the ordinary. There are many more cameras than is normal for a non-league game, but the supporters are different too: as the documentary Welcome to Wrexham returns to Disney+ for season two, we see red and white replica shirts being worn by fans from the US, Portugal, Australia and Thailand.</p><p>Wrexham FC had no such international following before 2020, when it was, bewilderingly, bought by Hollywood stars Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney. Investing an initial £2m, the friends promised to do two things: revamp the ailing Wrexham FC, perhaps even turn it into a Premier League club; and make a documentary about the journey.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/sep/13/welcome-

<p>Community of Gullah-Geechee people in Georgia protest vote for lifting protective laws, threatening a 230-year-old heritage</p><p>For more than 230 years, a small community of Gullah-Geechee people have called Sapelo Island off the coast of Georgia home. Hogg Hammock, the area on the island where these descendants of enslaved people live, is a 427-acre coastal community of 40 residents and has been designated as a historic site since 1996. That means that the construction of houses more than 1,400 sq ft and any road paving or demolition of property are strictly prohibited to preserve the island community.</p><p>On Tuesday, McIntosh county commissioners, who preside over Sapelo, voted to remove zoning restrictions in Hogg Hammock. Gullah-Geechee residents fear that wealthy transplants who want to develop larger homes and who could force a rise of property taxes there will displace them and upend their livelihoods.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/sep/12/slave-d
