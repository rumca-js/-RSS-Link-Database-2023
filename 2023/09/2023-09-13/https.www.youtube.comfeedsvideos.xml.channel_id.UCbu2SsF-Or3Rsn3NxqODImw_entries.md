Sit back and try to relax as these Fatalities melt your face off. 

These killer, kool fatalities are just the surface on what Mortal Kombat 1 has to offer. We've collected most of the fatalities, including the unlockable characters Havik as well as Sub-Zero and Scorpion Kameos. We're still busy unlocking more of the rest of the fatalities but here's all the ones we found so far.

Watch the intense, gory, and oddly intoxicating Fatal Blows.

Oh, man, we got a special treat for you all. These are most of the Fatal Blows in Mortal Kombat 1 in 4K glory. Of particular interest are the unlockable characters Havik and OG Sub-Zero and Scorpion.

Outposts in Starfield are entirely optional, but if you really want to sink your teeth into the game, they can be incredibly useful for not only resource management, but upgrading your weapons and gear.

There's a lot to the system that the game doesn't do the best job explaining, and it's easy to make mistakes without realizing, defeating the purpose of creating an outpost entirely. I've spent several hours with the system and have put together my findings into these thorough steps, so that you too can maximize your efficiency while also hopefully avoiding some of the pitfalls.Â Here's what you need to know about creating outposts in Starfield.

## Lies of P Review

Lies of P is an upcoming Soulslike game developed and published by Neowiz Games. The game takes inspiration from the Italian novel "The Adventures of Pinocchio" and is heavily influenced by From Software's Bloodborne.

While Lies of P is derivative of Bloodborne, it's one of the few examples of a Soulslike game done right. The combat has variety and feels good, while the game's environments ooze in atmosphere.
GameSpot's Richard Wakeling had a chance to check out the game, and this is his review of Lies of P. Lies of P is set to release September 19, 2023.
