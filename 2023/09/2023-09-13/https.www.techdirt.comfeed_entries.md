I must admit that before even beginning to write this story up about Bungie losing in court in the summary judgement phase on copyright and trademark infringement claims against cheat-seller Aimjunkies, I had to check the dates on the TorrentFreak post several times. That&#8217;s because we already talked about this a year ago, when Bungie [&#8230;]

Why do people still file these lawsuits? For years now, we see lawsuits filed against websites over their content moderation decisions, despite Section 230 barring them (and the 1st Amendment rights of the platform backing that up). These lawsuits always fail. Perhaps the reason we’re seeing a bunch more of these lately was because a [&#8230;]

Last week we discussed how a contract dispute between Charter (Spectrum) and Disney resulted in 15 million Charter customers losing access to more than 20 ABC and ESPN channels they pay for. We also noted how despite a lot of weird claims this standoff would somehow dramatically reshape television, that nothing would actually change and [&#8230;]

The UK government is still pushing a bill that would give it more direct control of the internet, but it has, at least for the time being, decided against mandating broken encryption. For months now, supporters of the Online Safety Bill have insisted the only way to stop the spread of child sexual abuse material [&#8230;]

So, we’ve been talking a lot about age verification of late, as governments around the world have all (with the exception of Australia?!?) seemed to settle on that as a solution to “the problem” of the internet (exactly what that problem is they cannot quite identify, but they’re pretty sure there is one). Of course, [&#8230;]

## College Kids Are Easily Bypassing Stupid University TikTok Bans

We’ve noted a few times how the political push to ban TikTok is a&#160;dumb performance&#160;largely designed to distract people from our failure to pass even a basic internet privacy law or regulate data brokers. We’ve also noted how college bans of TikTok are a&#160;dumb extension of that dumb performance, and don’t accomplish anything of meaningful [&#8230;]

The old saying goes: there&#8217;s only two things that are permanent, death and taxes. For quite a while now, we could have added a third item to the list: Intuit annoying us to death with its bullshit advertisement about filing for taxes for &#8220;free.&#8221; You really should go back and read our posts on this [&#8230;]
