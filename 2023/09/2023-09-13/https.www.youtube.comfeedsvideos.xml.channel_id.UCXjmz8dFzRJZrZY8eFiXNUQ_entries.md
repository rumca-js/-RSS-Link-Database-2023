Harry Potter is without a doubt the most famous character Daniel Radcliffe has portrayed in his long career in Hollywood.  Though unlike a lot of child actors that are cast in iconic roles, Daniel Radcliffe was able to lift himself out of the Harry Potter image and explore a truly weird and amazing career. Through Swiss Army Man, Weird: The Al Yankovic Story,  Miracle Works and so much more, Daniel Radcliffe has shown his affinity for the weird and strange.  Though he'll still always be remembered for his iconic portrayal of The Boy Who Lived.
