NetherRealm Studios' Mortal Kombat 1 is nearly upon us, and despite rebooting the timeline as we know it, there is a lot for fans to sink their teeth into. A brand new story with returning characters and new relationships to unravel; new gameplay mechanics, including faster movement; and Klassic Towers await.

That's not including the new Kameo Fighters system, which offers a new dimension to one's combos, or Invasions, a board game-style RPG mode, where players battle Invaders from alternate dimensions. The latter even has returning mini-games like Arcade Towers and Test Your Might.

Check out 15 things we can't wait to do when Mortal Kombat 1 launches. It arrives on September 19th for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC and Switch.
