What a comeback it would have been, Fiji down by 18 points with 14 to go. And popular. How popular. In the end, Wales’s nous, so used to an old-world status in rugby terms well above that of Fiji, saw them through. They have suffered their own trials of late, finding themselves three places below the Islanders in the world rankings, but their four tries left Fiji with just too much to make up.</p><p>These days it’s hard to know how seriously to take those rankings.

<p>George Ford’s drop goals and a solid defensive display against Argentina needs to be the start of a red rose renaissance</p><p>It is amazing the difference one decent result can make. On the train south from Paris on Saturday, the carriages had been packed with pessimistic England fans bracing for more trouble and strife. Suddenly every single one of them is cheerfully contemplating potential quarter-final opponents and daring to believe a rousing red‑rose renaissance is materialising beneath a clear blue Mediterranean sky.</p><p>Let’s just say that was not the universal mood in the immediate aftermath of Tom Curry’s red card when every white-shirted supporter will have had a familiar sinking feeling. World Cups can be shaped fundamentally by the tiniest of misjudgments and here, apparently, was another classic case study. What all concerned, including Argentina, underestimated was England’s resolution and desire to stand up and fight rather than bow to the supposedly inevitable.<

<p>The actor makes a convincing big screen comeback as a man visiting his family for the first time since transitioning, but effective moments are offset by clunkiness</p><p>Dominic Savage’s work tends to focus on people, usually women, facing some form of disruptive challenge to their everyday life, specific and stressful and never anything but utterly believable. He drew out Gemma Arterton’s greatest performance in 2017’s Toronto premiere The Escape as a deeply unsettled woman wanting out of her responsibilities as wife and mother. His Channel 4 anthology series I Am… has introduced a range of characters at an intersection, from a devastating Vicky McClure grappling with her partner’s emotional abuse to recent Bafta winner Kate Winslet as a mother struggling with a daughter crippled by social media addiction. His preference for often mundane naturalism, with dialogue usually improvised, has teased out grounded, unshowy performances and unusual, instinctive choices from stars often

<p>The Oscar-winner is reliably commanding as Lee Miller, who went from fashion to war photography, but she struggles to lift a by-the-numbers drama</p><p>A passion project almost a decade in the making, Lee is the kind of stodgy biopic that feels of a time far before that, a bullet point-ticking list of events gussied up to be an actual movie. The life it’s focused on, that of model turned second world war photographer Lee Miller, is an undeniably interesting one, but it’s only in the briefest of moments that the film justifies why it’s a narrative endeavour rather than a documentary and every one of those moments comes courtesy of its lead.</p><p>Attached to the project since it was officially announced back in 2015, Kate Winslet makes for a formidable Miller, lifting the film out of anonymity on her shoulders. It’s not hard to buy her as a woman who boasted the looks and then the resolve to go from magazine shoots to the battlefield, a seductive and steely performance that keeps c

<p><strong>Wales Millennium Centre, Cardiff</strong><br />Welsh National Opera mount Osvaldo Golijov’s work about the assassinated Spanish playwright Federico García Lorca – a fiercely evocative piece with the feel of a passion play</p><p>Poet and playwright <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/federico-garcia-lorca">Federico García Lorca</a> was shot dead just one month into the Spanish civil war in 1936. His martyrdom is central to Osvaldo Golijov’s single-act opera Ainadamar, named for the place just outside Granada – also known as the Fountain of Tears – where Lorca and later thousands of others were murdered. And the work has contributed further to the mythologising of the man now recognised as one of Spain’s great writers. It is curious then to consider that it was only in a 2003 revision of the piece, two years after its premiere, that librettist David Henry Hwang and Golijov included Lorca as an actual character.</p><p><a href="https://wno.org.uk/">Welsh National Oper

## ‘I feel like a man from another era’: Neanderthal hunter Ludovic Slimak

Explorer Ludovic Slimak has dedicated decades to unearthing the mystery of our prehistoric ancestors. Now he has found a missing piece that radically reshapes our understanding – not just of the Neanderthals but of humanity itself<p>There’s no confusing Ludovic Slimak for just another hotel guest. It’s a sweltering Sunday afternoon in late August and we’ve arranged to meet in the car park of a guesthouse on the outskirts of Montélimar, southeastern France. The lawn sprinklers are in full swing; a couple of kids play in the fenced-off poolside area. Hiding from the heat in my rental car, I’d been concerned we’d struggle to find each other: Slimak’s email and WhatsApp communication until now have been at best irregular; the phone signal is patchy in this rural French corner. As soon as he pulls up in a dust-covered Volkswagen minivan, however, I realise there’d been no need to worry. Amid the trickle of blissed-out holidaymakers, Slimak seriously sticks out: he has wild, long hair and

An American now living in London, she had just started her first job as a civil servant, working in counter-terrorism communications. She was waiting for security clearance when, one morning, about three weeks in, she got talking to a colleague in the kitchen. The woman was in her late 20s, and also new, she said. Glass showed her where the teaspoons were kept. A few days later, Glass ran into the woman again at her favourite cafe. “She was very curious about my background, my life, what my family did back in the US,” Glass recalls. “‘Your brother was in the military? How interesting!’ I just didn’t cotton on to it … Then she disappeared completely.”</p><p>Soon after, Glass learned that she had been granted her security clearance. But

In Rachmaninov’s Piano Concerto No 3 the soloist was Nobuyuki Tsujii, his playing urgent in the opening movement then densely textured in the second, as if in response to the thick, velvety sound Hindoyan coaxed from the strings during their big melody.

<p>Set in a petting zoo, this political fable for post-Brexit times is a stark portrait of an isolated, bankrupted community</p><p>Paris-based writer and translator <a href="https://www.adambiles.net/">Adam Biles</a>’s 2016 debut, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/04/feeding-time-adam-biles-review">Feeding Time</a></em>, was a darkly comic tale about the rebellious residents of an old people’s home. His second novel is a homage (and sequel) to George Orwell’s <em>Animal Farm</em>. Described as “a state-of-the-farmyard novel”, Biles has created<em> </em>a political fable for our post-Brexit times. Manor Farm, now a petting zoo in southern England, is undone by narcissistic leaders and populist politics. The pigs, divided into two parties – the Animalists (“nimble, generous … <em>Modern</em>”) and the Jonesists (“old-fashioned, nostalgic … human-lovers”), jostle for leadership of an increasingly dysfunctional council.</p><p>The farmyard community is beset by facti

Because Phelps’s philosophy is go big or go home, he tried to one-up himself from each party to the next. One year, he ordered a pair of white alligator boots. Another time, he mandated that only white cars be admitted to the VIP parking lining the street outside the club where the party was held. In 2018, five couples got married at the white party. And there was the year he advertised the event using muscular men decked out in tiny white swim

He even shaved off his hair with clippers.

<p>There’s nothing scary about the demon nun who returns to terrorise France in this pointless sequel</p><p>Here’s a sequel to a spin-off of a sequel with no reason to exist except the most baldly commercial: the Conjuring Universe is the highest grossing horror franchise of all time and 2018’s <em>The Nun</em> is its most lucrative film yet. So demon nun Valak is back, apparently on an unholy pilgrimage across 50s France, and only Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga) can stop her.</p><p>But Valak, with her chalky white Marilyn Manson makeup and tendency to pop up like a 2D-plywood target in an old-fashioned carnival game, still isn’t scary. Not even a little bit. Farmiga does make for a glowingly virtuous hero nun, especially now aided by spunky Storm Reid, but they’d be better off swapping the rosaries for roundhouse kicks and hiding a pair of Uzis under their habits. Alas, aside from one marvellous set piece at a magazine stand, <em>The Nun II</em>’s mid-century design is tasteful to the

Lightweight formulas give great coverage but won’t feel like you’re wearing a mask<p>Years ago I wrote a piece about the shelf life of makeup. Foundation has impressive longevity. If you keep it in a cool environment (a fridge is extreme, but each to their own), out of direct sunlight (in front of a window is an absolute no no) and with its lid on so it is not constantly exposed to the air, your foundation can last up to two years. In theory. But in reality, if you start a foundation, leave it for a few months and then go back to the half-used product, it’s a bit like going back to an ex – it’s never quite the same and it rarely ends well. The key to your foundation looking consistently fresh is to find one that compels you to use it regularly, so that it’s never left dormant for any length of time. With the new wave of foundations available, you’ll have no trouble achieving this, because once you’ve experienced their skin-boosting capabilities, you’ll relish any opportunity to use t

When I’m travelling alone, I become the best version of myself; the most decisive, the most charming, the most curious. I see more, go further, strike up conversations with people I’ll never meet again, yet always remember.
