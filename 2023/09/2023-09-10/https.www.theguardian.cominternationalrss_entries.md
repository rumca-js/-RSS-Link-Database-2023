<p>The two stars do their best with a psychologically limited two-hander that takes place in a taxi from JFK airport to Manhattan</p><p>One would be forgiven for thinking that the one-location two-hander Daddio was born from the many restrictions introduced by the advent of Covid, a safe and easy way to make something, <em>anything</em> in the pandemic’s darkest days. It might have made it all a little easier to like, or at least admire, if that were the case but the film, set in a cab ride from JFK airport to Manhattan, has been in the offing for far longer. Originally conceived as a stage play, it transformed into a Black List script in 2017 attracting the attention of Daisy Ridley before morphing once again into a low-key, low-interest fall festival premiere, shot at the end of last year, ushered to the screen by its star and producer, Dakota Johnson.</p><p>She plays a programmer landing in New York after a trip to see her half-sister, finding herself in a cab driven by Sean Penn’

<p>The Chilean dictator returns as a vampire – and his family’s out for blood. But this alternative history, though entertaining, feels​ politically enigmatic</p><p>After the ethereal, English-language <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/nov/07/spencer-review-portrait-of-a-princess-on-the-edge">Spencer</a></em>, Chilean director Pablo Larraín returns home with this gothic monochrome alt-history, imagining murderous dictator General Pinochet as a 250-year-old vampire. Having faked his death, Pinochet (Jaime Vadell), AKA El Conde, is hiding out in the crumbling grandeur of his Patagonian lair, hoping for death. This end-of-life ennui is disturbed by his money-grubbing family, not-so-loyal servant (Alfredo Castro) and a comely accountant-nun (Paula Luchsinger).</p><p>All are entertaining in turn, though none manages to drive a stake through the dark heart of Larraín’s often enigmatic political point. It’s down to the arch, instantly recognisable narration to really skewer

<p>There has been little outrage over the striker’s loan deal at the intractable Spanish club, only a willingness to move on</p><p>On Tuesday evening, as fans started heading towards the exits and the music was finally turned down, Getafe’s sporting director stood pitch side at the Coliseum and insisted that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/21/mason-greenwood-to-leave-manchester-united-after-internal-inquiry" title="">Mason Greenwood</a> is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/05/mason-greenwood-getafe-manchester-united-loan-signing" title="">just a footballer, the same </a>as any other he could have signed. Rubén Reyes said the Manchester United forward, who has not played since he was charged with attempted rape, coercive behaviour and assault in October 2022, is no different to Óscar Rodríguez and Diego Rico, who had been presented alongside him. But he knew that was not true and so did everyone there: Greenwood is better.</p><p>Which was wh

<p>Time alone is a chance to relax – and reboot your creativity</p><p>As a writer, I spend much of my time alone, and yet I almost always want more. I’m fascinated by the relationship between solitude and loneliness, between the yearning to be alone and our deep desire not to feel isolated. A few months ago, I announced to my family – who, to be clear, I love very much – that I was taking myself away for a weekend, something I had not done for more than a decade. My need to be on my own had become too loud to ignore. As I sometimes manage to, I’d let work expand into all the nooks and crannies of my life. All I was doing was work-parent-work-parent – and on that hamster wheel, it’s easy to forget the restorative power of solitude, let alone work out how to achieve it.</p><p>And so I went away, to a little hotel, and it was glorious, like a long, slow exhale. A full 28 hours in which no one asked me anything, or needed anything; nobody else had opinions about anything I did, or when I
