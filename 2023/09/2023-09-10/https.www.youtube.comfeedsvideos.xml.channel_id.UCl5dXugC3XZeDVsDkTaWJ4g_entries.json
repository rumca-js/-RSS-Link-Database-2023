However, as a foreigner, I encountered some challenges at the bus station in Istanbul. If you're planning to travel by bus in Turkey, I recommend watching this video for helpful tips on booking tickets online, securing the best seats, and learning about the amenities available on Turkish buses. You'll also get a glimpse of what the buses look like from the inside, find out how much tickets cost, and discover the cost of food at rest stops along the way. Additionally, the video includes tips on how to reach the Esenler bus station in Istanbul (the Largest Bus terminal in Turkey) in the most budget-friendly and efficient way. This video is based on my trip to Turkey in late 2022. #TravelVlog #mountaintrekker #Turkey\n\n\nIf you like my videos, PLEASE SHARE them and let others get inspired to explore this beautiful world.
