The type system is extremely advanced \u2014 you can model algebraic data types (unions, intersections, tuples), conditional types, mapped types, and more. It is a structural type system. In TS 4.1, template literal types were introduced, making it easy to do string manipulation within the type system so that you can concatenate, compare, and pattern-match the types. Many of the examples below (like TS-SQL) use template literal types.\n\nSome interesting app", "link": "https://matt-rickard.com/typescript-type-system-hacks", "date_published": "2023-09-02T13:30:58+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Matt Rickard", "album": "Matt Rickard", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}]
