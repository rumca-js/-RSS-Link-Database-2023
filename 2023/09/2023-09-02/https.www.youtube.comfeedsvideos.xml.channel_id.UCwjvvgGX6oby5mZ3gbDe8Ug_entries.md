This is a live-streaming street in Zhengzhou. Millions of young people in China face a record unemployment rate of more than 21 %. They are trying to build success by selling merchandise or services live on platforms such as Alibaba's Tmall and Taobao and ByteDance's Douyin. However, the official claim of 21% youth unemployment is probably still too low compared to reality.
A survey of more than 10,000 young people on the social media platform Sina Weibo in July 2023 found that more than 60% said they were interested in becoming web celebrities or live streamers.
According to iResearch, the live-streaming industry employed 1.23 million anchors as of 2020, and a boom in live-streaming sales during the pandemic helped the industry generate a $480 billion business in China last year.
