<p>The Jacksonville shooting is a reminder of the long history of terrorism against Black people, their colleges and their universities</p><p>Just nine years after Augusta Institute’s founding in Georgia, a <a href="https://www.historynet.com/war-terror-kept-blacks-oppressed-long-civil-war-ended/">bloody massacre</a> took place directly across the Savannah River in Hamburg, South Carolina. Since 1867, the leaders of the institute – a small, all-Black seminary – had endured various attacks by local white citizens for educating Black students following the civil war. But the Hamburg massacre, which resulted in the execution of six Black men ahead of one of the most contentious presidential <a href="https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/educational-resources/disputed-election-1876">elections </a> in US history, epitomized the extent of post-emancipation violence against Black advancement.

<p>Leftover yoghurt is adept at tenderising protein, and you can even marinate this lamb in the pot</p><p>Even the scrapings from a large pot of yoghurt are enough to create the beginnings of a magical meal. Yoghurt tenderises protein, and also helps create a crust that caramelises beautifully, either in the pan or on the barbecue. Any combination of spices will work in the marinade, so experiment with whatever you have in your store cupboard. The marinade works on just about any protein, too. Here, I’ve combined aubergines with lamb, because they go so well together, especially when slathered with za’atar, lemon and garlic yoghurt.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/sep/02/turn-yoghurt-into-middle-eastern-marinade-recipe-zero-waste-cooking-tom-hunt">Continue reading...</a>
