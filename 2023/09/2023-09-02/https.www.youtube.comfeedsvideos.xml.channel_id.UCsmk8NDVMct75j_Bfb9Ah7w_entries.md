Here are the best VR games and experiences from Gamescom 2023! I put together a roundup of all the virtual reality content I tried on the show floor including a shocking haptic vest and loads of upcoming VR games such as Arashi Castles Of Sin Final Cut on PSVR 2, Vampire Masquerade and a Quest game that gave me strong Dead Space vibes!
