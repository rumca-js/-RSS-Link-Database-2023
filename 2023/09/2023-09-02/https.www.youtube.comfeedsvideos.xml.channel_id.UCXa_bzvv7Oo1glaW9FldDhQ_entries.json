Its style, music and gameplay are all reminiscent of Jet Set Radio. You'll grind around locations, battle rival crew members and earn REP to take over the five boroughs of the world.\n\nIt can feel pretty easy, while its tagging and tricks feel overly simple. Its gameplay loop may also become repetitive despite its length. Thankfully, it establishes a presence with its story and intriguing level design while delivering fluid controls that are easy to pick up.\n\nBomb Rush Cyberfunk is a venerable blast from the past, with a gorgeous art style and sharp soundtrack to match, and that's more than enough.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV3diXmTuus", "date_published": "2023-09-02T00:15:01+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/UV3diXmTuus/hqdefault.jpg"}]
