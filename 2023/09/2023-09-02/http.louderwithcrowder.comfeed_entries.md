In research that I'm sure is meant for Leftists to have an excuse to take our meat away, 50% is the US beef supply is eaten by only twelve percent of Americans. And it's mostly men doing all the beef eating! What's ironic is that when <a href="https://twitter.com/ToolManTimLWC" target="_blank">Tool Man Tim</a> sent me this article, I had just put a brisket in the refrigerator to defrost.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

Jimmy Buffett's family announced that the pirate has passed away at age 76. The iconic singer of "Margaritaville," "Come Monday," and my personal favorite "Why Don't We Get Drunk" left this life surrounded by his family, friends, music, and dogs. "He lived his life like a song till the very last breath and will be missed beyond measure by many."</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Some of you youngbloods may not be familiar, but if you've ever blown off work because "it was 5 o'clock somewhere," thank Jimmy. His music brought the party for generations and generations. Jimmy is the soundtrack to garage beers and day drinking, lounging arou

She is the Canadian teacher with the size Z-cup chesticles (and rock-hard nipples). It was odd she was teaching again because while a school board had first affirmed her trans identity and allowed her to prance around high schoolers with enormous hooters, Kayla <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kayla-lemieux-paid-leave" target="_blank">found themselves suspended without pay</a> when there were reports he was faking the whole time.</p><p>See, it would have been fine to parade around kids with comically oversized titties if in your brain you THOUGHT you were a lady.
