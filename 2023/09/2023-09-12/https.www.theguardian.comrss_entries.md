Here, it was Scotland’s turn to suffer.</p><p>England were excellent in the first half, Bellingham involved in Phil Foden’s deft opener and scoring the second himself.

<p>Labour leader’s decision to give his deputy the front-of-house gig at congress signals a shift in their uneasy relationship</p><p>First get all your ducks in a row. For much of the last three years you couldn’t miss the tension at the top of the Labour party. Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner made an uneasy couple as leader and deputy. They smiled for the cameras and more or less held things together in public, but behind the scenes neither really trusted one another. If they stopped short of openly trashing each other, then they happily damned with faint praise. Even if Labour were to win the next election, few gave the relationship a long-term future. They needed each other, but they didn’t like each other that much.</p><p>But, over the summer, there has been a shift. A softening. A coming together. Starmer and Rayner appear to realise that together they are more than the sum of their parts. That, actually, they work well together. They both have a lot to offer the other. It’s part

The central game is simple: one must enter the lift of a 10-floor building and proceed to travel in a specific sequence through a series of floors, the last of which supposedly opens a portal to a dangerous parallel world. The trick here is to close your eyes, or risk being torn to pieces by a mysterious apparition referred to as “the woman on the fifth floor”.</p><p>Such a scenario is ripe with potential for world-building details and creative designs, but there is little visual flair on show here.

Garcia had just returned from his night shift at a lumber mill, about 28 miles away from the earthquake’s epicentre, where he operated a board edger, repeatedly straightening and smoothing slabs of rough lumber. After the shaking stopped, he stood up and drove back to the mill to check on his co-workers. Later, he messaged me: “It hit hard. Power jus

Sixty feet away, the batter raises and cocks his bat in anticipation. Then the pitcher slowly removes his shirt, flings his glove and cap to one side and launches into a sexy rendition of a Celine Dion song, while his teammates gather in formation around him and wave flares. Behind home plate, the umpire is enthusiastically twerking.</p><p>The Savannah Bananas were born a decade ago, when a former pitcher called Jesse Cole was coaching a team in the Cape Cod league for the summer and realised that the game he was watching was boring him to tears. So he bought a small team in Savannah, renamed it the Bananas, put on a yellow tuxedo, hired a group of elderly cheerleaders named the Banana Nanas, and thus was built a sensation that in a few short years has begun to

And on the few hot days we had, it hasn’t been the kind of weather you can bank on enough to leave the house without a jacket stashed in a tote.</p><p>So here we are, edging into autumn and the time for putting those frothier threads back into a box until next year.

<p>The Nobel winner’s short memoir takes an episode of domestic violence when she was 12 as inspiration for a deft and powerful study of her childhood self</p><p>“My father tried to kill my mother one Sunday in June, in the early afternoon.” So begins <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/oct/06/annie-ernaux-wins-the-2022-nobel-prize-in-literature">Nobel winner</a> Annie Ernaux’s latest book to be translated into English, describing a single, savage incident witnessed by the author in childhood. It seems to have had no precedent, nor any repercussions, not chez Ernaux anyway. But anyone familiar with this extraordinary writer’s oeuvre – all those unsparingly astute excavations of self – will already have grasped that this is not the point.</p><p>This incident takes place shortly after mass when Annie is 12 years old. It features an especially ferocious argument between her parents, a cellar beneath the family cafe and, chillingly, a scythe used for cutting firewood. Yet ult

<p>Freezing benefits in order to slash taxes for wealthy voters? It’s nakedly obvious who this government really cares about</p><p>Spare a moment’s thought for Britain, a country twice used as a laboratory for the latest trend in rightwing politics. Four decades ago, we were the Tories’ lab rats for what became known as neoliberalism – mass privatisation, slashed taxes for the rich, the crushing of trade unions – and it delivered weak long-term growth that was inequitably distributed. This time round, their grand experiment has been rightwing populism: a fusion of crude nationalism, demagoguery, culture wars and migrant bashing.</p><p>One of its hallmarks has been to dress a rightwing party bankrolled by hedgefunds and City slickers in the sort of garb normally worn by the left – posing as insurgent tribunes of the people against contemptuous elites.

<p>A knockout central performance isn’t enough to save Netflix’s misfiring tale of seedy sales reps kicking off the opioid epidemic</p><p>It’s hard to pull your eyes away from Emily Blunt in the fact-based Netflix caper Pain Hustlers, the actor at her most luminous movie star best, a rare lead role in a film where she isn’t being chased by aliens or, even worse, being forced to banter with Dwayne Johnson. As one of our finest and most versatile A-listers working today, it’s frustrating that Blunt is also one of our least utilised, until this summer’s Oppenheimer (where she tries hard to make the most out of “wife”). Her only “one for her” choice in recent years was 2020’s utterly baffling Wild Mountain Thyme, a film even she couldn’t save. Her magnetism is both blessing and curse here for director David Yates, for it gives his film a pulse it doesn’t either deserve or always know what to do with, her performance towering so very high above everything surrounding her.</p><p>For a brie
