We&#8217;ve talked about this case – American Society for Testing and Materials et al v. PublicResource.org – a few times before.

If you read this morning’s story about Elon Musk’s impulsive decision to move servers out of Sacramento and up to Portland in a dangerous and wholly unsecure manner, and wondered if the FTC (who has two consent decrees with the company regarding how it protects users’ private data) was aware of it, we already have [&#8230;]
