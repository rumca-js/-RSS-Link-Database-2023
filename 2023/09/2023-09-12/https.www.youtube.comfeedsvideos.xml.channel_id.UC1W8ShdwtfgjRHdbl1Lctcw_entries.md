I colorized, restored  and created sound design for New Version of The flying train in Wuppertaler, Germany 1902, Passengers saw Wuppertal's inhabitants crossing pedestrian bridges and taking dirt roads over a century ago. Today, the city is still famous for its "schwebebahn", a type of suspended railroad unique to Germany.
