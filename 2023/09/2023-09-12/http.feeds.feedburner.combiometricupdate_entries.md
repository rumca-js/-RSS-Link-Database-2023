		According to an inquiry by Members of Parliament, the new voter ID rule, which was first put into practice in 2023 local elections, has led to cases of racial and disability discrimination.

The inquiry found that the system as it stands today "disenfranchises more electors than it protects." It claims that "polling clerks are more likely to fail to compare a photo ID to the person presenting that document if the person is of a different ethnicity," worsening the potential for discrimination.

The report also highlighted the case of Andrea Barrett, a disabled immunocompromised woman who wears a mask when in public. Polling officers refused to accept her into the station unless she removed her mask. There were no guidelines for how officers should have responded

		The Elections Coordinating Committee (ECC), a civil society organization working for the promotion of electoral integrity in Liberia and good governance, has concluded that the first-ever biometric voter registration (BVR) in the country, which unfolded early this year, was largely successful and peaceful despite a few challenges.

In a 27-page <a href="https://eccliberiacom.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ECC-Technical-BVR-Report_2023.pdf">technical report</a> which details the entire BVR process, the ECC also notes that dividing the biometrics enrollment into two phases afforded the National Elections Commission (NEC) the opportunity to learn from the shortcomings of the first, and improve things in the second.

The BVR in Liberia took place between March an

		Biometric data injection attacks are increasingly associated with deepfakes, as attackers use camera emulators to spoof remote identity proofing systems with fake selfies. The problem goes beyond deepfakes, however, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/clr-labs">CLR Labs</a> argues in a new white paper.

Independent laboratory CLR Labs, which has locations in France and Belgium, points out that injection attacks can also be used to mount attacks based on digital falsified ID documents, and urges the industry to seriously consider the full scope of the attack type.

		The quilt of consumer privacy laws in the United States continues to unfold. This week, lawmakers for the state of Pennsylvania started discussions on their proposed Consumer Data Privacy Act.

House Bill <a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/BillInfo.cfm?syear=2023&amp;sind=0&amp;body=H&amp;type=B&amp;bn=1201">1201</a>, would let residents opt out of their data processed, <a href="https://statescoop.com/pennsylvania-lawmakers-consider-data-privacy-bill/">according</a> to StateScoop.

More precisely, it would mandate that Pennsylvania businesses make the mechanism for that option. There would be no individual right of action for violations; people would have to petition the state's attorney general to sue.
