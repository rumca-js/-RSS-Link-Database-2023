<p>So all the speculation was largely on target.</p><p>At its big Tuesday event, not only did Apple unveil its new iPhone 15 and 15 Pro line-ups, but it stressed environmental bona fides and its efforts toward becoming carbon neutral by 2030. It also introduced the Apple Watch Series 9, an Apple Watch Ultra 2, and offered  noteworthy commitments regarding its future corporate environmental responsibility.</p><p>In other news, iOS 17, iPadOS 17, watchOS 10, tvOS 17, and HomePod 17 will be available as free updates on Sept. 18; macOS Sonoma ships a little later, on Sept. 26.And as expected, Apple’s iPhones, watches, and AirPods Pro will be among the first of its mobile products to be equipped with USB-C, in line with EU regulation. EarPods will also migrate to USB-C<strong>.</strong></p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3706475/apple-launches-the-iphone-15-series-new-apple-watches-and-talks-up-its-green-plans.html#jump">
