The company’s got <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steam20">a cute walk down memory lane</a> to help celebrate, too.

  <p id="dMGKsC">Apple has a new premium material for Apple Watch bands and iPhone cases. It’s here to replace its leather offerings that, in the case of phone cases at least, have been declining in quality for several years now. The new material is called FineWoven, a soft fabric material Apple will offer in an assortment of iPhone and Apple Watch band colors. The change comes as leather “has a significant carbon footprint at Apple’s scale,” according to Lisa Jackson, Apple’s environmental policy VP.</p>

  <p id="3xf4Va">Apple has announced its newest flagship smartwatch, the Apple Watch Ultra 2. The Ultra 2’s design looks quite similar to that of the first-generation Apple Watch Ultra, which means most of the upgrades are on the inside.</p>
<p id="Uztdzw">The watch has an upgraded display from the previous Ultra model, rated for 3,000 nits, which Apple says is the brightest display an Apple Watch has ever had. Apple claims that users will get 72 hours to a charge when the device is in low-power mode. The case is now made from 95 percent recycled titanium.</p>

  <p id="wtwMGS">Apple announced the Apple Watch Series 9 at its Wonderlust event on Tuesday, and it will eventually include a whole new double-tap gesture.</p>
<p id="TlD78Q">One of the biggest changes is a new S9 SiP (System in Package). The CPU has 5.6 billion transistors, a GPU that’s 30 percent faster, and a four-core neural engine. That translates to improvements like Siri requests being processed on the device. The watch also has a second-generation ultra wideband chip to help with precision finding with your iPhone. One other improvement is a brighter display: Apple says it can get as bright as 2000 nits, which is double the maximum you can get from the

  <p id="zS7PLh">Fresh off being <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/17/23797338/corsair-drop-acquisition-mechanical-keyboards">acquired by Corsair</a>, Drop is overhauling its in-house mechanical keyboard lineup with the new Alt V2, Ctrl V2, and Shift V2. Like their 2018-era predecessors, the Alt V2 is a compact keyboard with a 65 percent layout, the Ctrl V2 is tenkeyless (so it doesn’t have a numpad), and the Shift V2 has all the keys of a full-size keyboard but smushed into a more compact 1800 layout. There are also upgrade kits to let existing Ctrl, Alt, and Shift owners turn their keyboards into V2 models.</p>
