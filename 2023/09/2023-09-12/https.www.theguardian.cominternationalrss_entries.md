<p>Prime minister Chris Hipkins must articulate vision to win back young voters and overcome prevailing mood for change ahead of October election</p><p>As support for Labour continues to slip, its worsening poll performance on party vote is not its biggest hurdle to re-election. With less than five weeks until election day, the prime minister, Chris Hipkins, is not fighting a popular opposition, but an unmistakable mood for change. A strong undercurrent of dissatisfaction, driven by personal financial hardships and an uncertain economic outlook, has New Zealand voters looking anywhere else for reprieve.</p><p>Convincing undecided and swing voters to lean into the status quo is a far more difficult task in this environment. The opposition leader, Christopher Luxon, knows this. Maintaining a disciplined focus on the cost of living and the need to “get New Zealand back on track” over the coming weeks may be all he needs to secure a workable coalition government.
