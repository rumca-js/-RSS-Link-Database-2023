Developing a horror game can be difficult, especially when balancing serious themes like family strife and PTSD. Ad Infinitum balances this well, delivering an intriguing first-person adventure as a soldier struggles to escape a never-ending cycle of psychological trauma.

The visuals are on point, the puzzles are decent, and the backstory is compelling. Problems emerge when accounting for the horror elements. They're just not executed as well. Throw in some iffy stealth mechanics, strange AI behavior and a fair amount of jank for good measure.

It isn't to say Ad Infinitum is an awful game. It has appeal in some areas, but its psychological horror leaves something to be desired, especially when competing for screen time with other narrative beats.

Watch_Dogs might not have started life on the best foot forward (thanks to an E3 presentation that was mostly smoke and mirrors) but managed to turn itself into a household open-world brand by correcting itself with each new entry. Between this and the strong launch sales of Watch_Dogs: Legion, why is it that we still don’t know anything about the next entry in the series? 

Why is it that it’s been almost 3 years since Legion released, and the future is looking rather bleak for the Watch_Dogs brand? Answering this question requires us to take a look at the franchise’s past outings, and the current market scenario, and analyze these factors to reach a suitable conclusion. In this issue of What The Hell Happened, we take a deep dive into the curious case of Watch_Dogs.

Not appearing in every Mortal Kombat entry, but still amongst the most storied of all MK’s characters in Kung Lao. Originally a peace-loving pacifist who evolved into a powerful, vengeful entity as the series progressed. The most iconic aspect of Kung Lao is of course his Oddjob inspired steel rimmed hat, capable of cleanly slicing enemies into pieces. 

Whilst his fighting style is decidedly Shaolin Fist, Kung Lao’s signature moves and fatalities often revolve around the hat in some way, with MK developers dreaming up increasingly disgusting ways for Kung Lao to scythe foes in two with his sharp headwear. This feature highlights the evolution of Kung Lao’s outfits and move sets throughout his appearances in Mortal Kombat games, although only mainline canon entries have been considered.

Alongside Scorpion, Sub-Zero is among Mortal Kombat’s most recognisable characters, appearing in some form or other throughout the 30 odd year history of the fighting franchise.

Blue is his color of choice, reflecting his supreme control over the powers of ice whilst being the signature colourway of the Lin Kuei. The original moniker of Bi-Han before being assumed by little brother Kuai Liang, Sub-Zero’s powers grew to immense proportion throughout Mortal Kombat’s history, making him one of the most fearsome foes in the entire roster. 

This video discusses the outfits Sub-Zero adorns throughout the series, with canon entries the only games included. Speculation on his fighting style and signature moves round out this feature, as interestingly it appears Sub-Zero will have lost some of his power and prowess in regressing back to his original form as portrayed by Bi-Han in Mortal Kombat 1.
