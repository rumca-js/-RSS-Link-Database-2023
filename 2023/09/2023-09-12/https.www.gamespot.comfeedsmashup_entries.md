<p dir="ltr">A newly discovered species of Australian spider has been christened Venomius tomhardyi, in homage to actor Tom Hardy and his portrayal of the Marvel character Venom, as per a new study published in the journal <a href="https://evolsyst.pensoft.net/article/110022/">Evolutionary Systematics</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The authors noted that prominent black markings on the spider's thorax resembled the patterns seen on Venom's head after merging with Marvel's Eddie Brock, portrayed by Hardy in the films. The rest gets pretty inside science-y baseball, but the gist is this: Venomius is a newly discovered genus of Australian orb-weaving spiders--while they possess venom to immobilize their prey, their venom is typically not potent enough to pose a significant threat to humans. Still, probably would not be a welcome sight in the shower.</p><p dir="ltr"><span>In taxonomy, drawing inspiration from popular culture for nomenclature is not a new phenomenon.

<p>Game toolset creator Unity is introducing a new fee for game developers based on game installs. The new policy comes into effect on January 1, 2024.</p><p>Here are the details of how this will work. Unity is split into two basic functions: the Unity Editor, for developers, and the Unity Runtime, which is the code that executes on PCs, consoles, or mobile to actually play the games. The fee is based on Unity Runtime and activates every time a "qualifying" game is installed. The fee only activates after certain revenue and install base numbers have been met, depending on what version of Unity is being used. The fee itself will also change depending on the number of installs and what region the game is from.</p><p>For users of Unity Personal and Plus, the fees will kick in once a game has made $200,000 or more in the last 12 months and once it has been installed at least 200,000 times over its whole lifetime. For Unity Pro and Enterprise, the game will have to have made $1,000,000 or
