Launched on September 12, 2003, the game launcher practically synonymous with PC gaming is not only celebrating a new milestone, but it&rsquo;s inviting us to the party, too&mdash;in the form of some steeply discounted games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In honor of the anniversary, a retrospective page has gone live on Steam&rsquo;s front page. It chronicles the launcher&rsquo;s history year by year, highlighting the developments on the platform and the top games. (Has it really been only eight years that we could get refunds? Also rest in peace, Steam Machine initiative.) While there&rsquo;s no cake, you do get something sweet: many of those popular games can be had for as little as $1. Some for even <em>less</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2065529/steam-just-turned-20-and-were-getting-the-gift-of-cheap-games.html", "date_published": "2023-09-12T21:09:48+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "PC world", "album": "PC world", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Microsoft is killing third-party printer drivers in Windows 11", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft will no longer provide new drivers from printer manufacturers via Windows Update starting in 2025, the company has <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/print/end-of-servicing-plan-for-third-party-printer-drivers-on-windows&amp;xcust=2-1-2063966-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a>.
