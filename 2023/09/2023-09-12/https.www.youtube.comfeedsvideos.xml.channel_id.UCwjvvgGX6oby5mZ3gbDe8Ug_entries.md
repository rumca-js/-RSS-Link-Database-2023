The Hong Kong Observatory continued to issue black rainstorm warnings, while Shenzhen was too slow in announcing flood discharge notifications, provoking outrage from the Hong Kong people. At 23:05 hours on September 7, the Hong Kong Observatory issued a black rainstorm warning. 
The black warning signifies that rain exceeding 70mm an hour has or is expected to fall. It recorded 158.1 millimeters of rain in one hour from 23:00 hours on the same day, the highest in 140 years of meteorological records in Hong Kong.
