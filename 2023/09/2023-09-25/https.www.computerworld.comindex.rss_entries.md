<p>A job posting from Microsoft, for a qualified nuclear technology program manager, indicates that the company is planning to integrate small nuclear reactors into its power systems for data centers.</p><p>The software giant is already working with at least one third-party nuclear energy provider in an effort to reduce its carbon footprint. The ad, though, signals an effort to make nuclear energy an important part of its energy strategy.   </p><p>The posting said that the new nuclear expert “will maintain a clear and adaptable roadmap for the technology’s integration,” and have “experience in the energy industry and a deep understanding of nuclear technologies and regulatory affairs.”</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3707472/microsofts-data-centers-are-going-nuclear.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>The UK’s Competition and Market’s Authority (CMA) has declared that Microsoft has addressed the concerns it had about the software giant's $68.7 billion acquisition of gaming studio Activision Blizzard, clearing the way for the deal to go ahead.</p><p>In April, the CMA blocked Microsoft from making the acquisition over concerns the deal could “alter the future of the fast-growing cloud gaming market, leading to reduced innovation and less choice for UK gamers over the years to come.”</p><p>Although Microsoft had submitted a proposal to address some of its concerns before the CMA reached its <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3694651/uk-regulators-block-microsofts-acquisition-of-activision-blizzard.html">decision in April</a>, that proposal ultimately contained a number of significant shortcomings.

Even when vendors don’t understand business tech needs, IT directors and C-suite leaders certainly should. So why does vendor spin work with an audience that knows better? The most likely answer: lying and exaggerating is so ludicrously common for so many vendors — especially the big tech companies — that it’s impossible to ding any one vendor for lying. </span></p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3707468/forrester-asks-a-forbidden-questi
