		For all its boilerplate bluster about winning the biometric privacy lawsuit it was defending against in the United States, face-scraper Clearview AI is settling.

Details of the settlement have not been, and may never be, revealed, so it is possible that other defendants involved in other Biometric Information Privacy Act cases would be jealous of how far the agreement leans to Clearview.

But the reality more likely is that Clearview and its investors will have saved themselves some of the penalties that were <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/settlement-of-bipa-suit-against-clearview-ai-could-be-days-away">sought</a> in <a href="https://www.troutman.com/a/web/280464/BIOMETRICS-SECTION-1st-BULLET-ClearviewAIPrelimInj.pdf" rel=
