After having spent three years on the PC, Gloomhaven is finally out now on consoles. The game puts players in charge of a guild of mercenaries in the titular city, as they take on quests to grow not only their own wallets, but also the city itself. The digital edition of the game makes use of a tabletop-styled aesthetic to emulate the feeling of playing a dungeon-diving experience with a group of friends.

Gloomhaven is especially notable for having an incredibly deep combat system that revolves around using various cards in different ways. Each one of its characters offers an incredible level of variety in how they play, and players will never end up seeing the same thing twice thanks to the sheer number of different unlockable characters and quests throughout the game.

Despite some controversies over its always online nature, even when playing alone, Payday 3 had a decent amount of hype behind it. The sequel to 2010's Payday 2 promises a complete overhaul of several systems while revamping the gameplay, improving the visuals and much more.

Unfortunately, when it launched worldwide on September 21st for Xbox Series X/S, PS5 and PC, Starbreeze's co-op shooter faced issues with its matchmaking and servers. Even when it seemed these were resolved, they cropped up once again, and due to the game constantly being online, solo play is out of the question.

The sad part is that even if matchmaking improves, Payday 3 has a lot of core issues that will frustrate both long-time fans and new players. Learn more about them here.

Cyberpunk 2077 has spent nearly three years trying to right the wrongs of the unmitigated disaster that was its launch, and though the road has been a long and bumpy one, CD Projekt RED’s open world action RPG is now finally in a place where it can unequivocally be called a legitimately good game. 

It has, of course, addressed the vast majority of its biggest technical issues by now, but with Update 2.0, Cyberpunk 2077 has also radically overhauled and improved several of its crucial gameplay systems and mechanics that were previously disappointingly underbaked. 

Now, with a much more vibrant open world, a much more rewarding progression system, and significantly more enjoyable stealth and combat, it’s a game that manages to come closer to the vision that CDPR sold us all those years ago than most would have hoped it would after its terrible launch.
