<p>Sennheiser announced a new pair of mid-ranged headphones today that carry over some features from its latest flagship model. The Accentum Wireless offers “a similar sound” to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sennheiser-momentum-4-review-140004906.html">$380 Momentum 4</a>, along with hybrid active noise cancellation (ANC), 50-hour battery life and a $180 price tag.</p><p>The company suggests you’ll hear “breathtaking Sennheiser sound” from Accentum Wireless. They use 37mm dynamic transducers (slightly smaller than the 42mm ones in the Momentum 4) and Bluetooth 5.2 with multipoint connectivity. The headphones support <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.aptx.com/aptx-hd">aptX HD</a>, which can output up to a 576 kbps bitrate for those with supported devices. It’s also compatible with AAC (the maximum for iPhone users) and SBC codecs.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The headphones’ battery can last an estimated 50 hours on a single charge, not terribly far

The platform’s new <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.redditinc.com/blog/updating-reddit-gold-and-rolling-out-our-new-contributor-program">Contributor Program</a> allows redditors who meet certain requirements to receive real-world money (distributed monthly) for their awarded content.

Reddit will grant “standard contributor” status (earning 90 cents per gold awarded) to those with at least 10 gold who received between 100 and 4,999 karma in the last 12 months.

<p><em>Resident Evil Village</em> is a haunting horror romp starring a very tall and elegant vampire lady (and some other monsters, sure), and it's heading to iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max on October 30. It'll hit the M1 and M2 models of the iPad Pro and iPad Air on the same day. The base game will cost $40 and its Winters’ Expansion DLC will be an additional $20.</p><p><em>Resident Evil Village</em> originally came to PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S in 2021, and it became a cultural touchstone for its monster-mashing storyline.
