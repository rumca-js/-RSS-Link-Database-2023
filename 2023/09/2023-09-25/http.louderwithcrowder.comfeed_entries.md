<p>All California public schools will be <a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/newsom-signs-law-requiring-gender-185025415.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">required </a>to provide gender-neutral bathrooms under a law signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom on Saturday.</p>
<p>Public schools teaching first through 12th grade must have at least one gender-neutral bathroom available for students by 2026.</p>
<p>You know, because first graders can choose their gender. </p>
