Seventeen years on, pioneering CCTV may help her get closure</p><p>Sheila Blanco has been investigating the death of her son, Mark, for nearly 17 years. She has given interviews many times since 2006 to keep her son’s name in the spotlight, in the hope that this will apply pressure where it needs to be applied.

The chairs are corralled behind a low barrier, to deter the adventurous from taking a seat and doing themselves a mischief. Those pesky Tate barriers also prevent you from sitting on another chair, beneath a plain wooden box cantilevered above it, which is meant to function as a portable smoking area. What spoilsports these museums are. No smoking, no touching, and definitely no wanking, though a couple of sculptured mechanical arms with clenched fists are going through the motions.</p><p>Sarah Lucas’s Happy Gas at Tate Britain is more than an opportunity to leer and laugh or indulge our prurient and perverse fantasies, though it is an exhibition devoted to sex, smoking, death, the nudge-nudge, lists of swe

Unless, of course, you want to be pedantic and count Ipswich Town, who went down after losing 9-0 at Old Trafford in March 1995. Or Nottingham Forest, who finished rock-bottom of the table after losing 8-1 at home to Lord Ferg’s treble-winners of 1999. Or the Blades’ rivals Sheffield Wednesday, who dropped through the trap-door at the end of a campaign in which they also lost 8-0 to Newcastle, a game in which Alan Shearer spanked five goals past an increasingly glum Kevin Pressman.</p><p>Far

Here are some of 2023’s most exciting combinations</p><p>The beer cocktail has its roots in the vulgar pastime of beer adulteration: putting stuff in beer to make it stronger (like whiskey) or weaker (such as lemonade).

<p>Fine win against Lazio lifted hopes but 4-2 loss raises questions about <em>Bianconeri</em>’s ability to challenge</p><p>For the first time in two years, Massimiliano Allegri stopped tinkering. Since returning to Juventus in 2021, he had taken charge of 112 games and changed his starting XI in every single one. There was genuine shock in the press box at the Mapei Stadium on Saturday as journalists realised the team to face Sassuolo was the same one that beat Lazio 3-1 a week before.</p><p>Allegri has suggested previously that his team selections rely on intuition more than over-analysis, telling <em>La Repubblica</em>: “I can’t stay 24 hours searching for a solution, I have to wait for inspiration to arrive.” It is easy to understand why his gut might have told him to stick, not twist, on this occasion. Juventus were brilliant against Lazio: exerting control even without possession against last season’s runners-up.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/sep/2

<p>Adapted from Carolyn Weber’s memoir of the same name, Ryan Whitaker’s  drama suggests that finding love and God when you least expect it is a deeply bland affair</p><p>This is a film based on a true story, but it doesn’t make this faith-based romantic drama look or feel anything like reality. It is adapted from a memoir by the American author and academic Carolyn Weber about her time at Oxford on a full scholarship writing a PhD on the Romantics. I felt it in the pit of my stomach about 10 minutes in when it dawned on me the “surprise” was that she found God.</p><p>Directed by Ryan Whitaker, this is a film very much in keeping with the conventions of Christian drama: blandly inspirational with a glazed-over style of acting, aside from some gobsmackingly unsubtle eccentric professors, hammily performed by actors including Simon Callow.

Humans can count, humans can read, humans can reason. These advanced abilities are often attributed to the human brain as a piece of hardware.

Instead, much of our thinking is the result of successive cultural software upgrades; of thousands of years of evolving knowledge, skills and ways of thinking passed down through generations.</p><p>Take numbers.

Very briefly, the possibility loomed that he might be about to arrive. This was the perfect moment for him to cast off all the doubts. Smash this into the top corner, win <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/24/arsenal-tottenham-premier-league-match-report">the north London derby</a> with a brilliant late winner, and in an instant his journey in fans’ affections from puzzlement to embrace would have been completed.</p><p>It was not an easy chance, far from it, but so much the better: nobody becomes a hero with a tap-in.

Havertz chewed the collar of his shirt: he knew what that moment represented.</p> <a href="https://www.the

His manager, Ange Postecoglou, was less willing to talk about timelines but it is undeniable that few outsiders expected Tottenham to emerge from the derby unscathed. That they did so was a testament to their bravery, and especially that of Maddison: he was caught in possession glaringly for a chance Gabriel Jesus inexplicably skied, but kept showing up for the ball in difficult areas and finished with two assists. Tottenham looked raw at times, skittish at others, and lived on their nerves for spells, but never strayed from Postecoglou’s fluid, proactive philosophy. “He said today that that’s the way he wants to play,” Maddison said. “If we lose playing his way, that’s on him, his responsibility, and it gives you freedom to go and play as

<p>What does representing Europe mean given the disparate nationalities uniting in a common cause against the US?</p><p>It started in January in Abu Dhabi. At the all-European Hero Cup, an early precursor to the Ryder Cup, Luke Donald put some messaging in place. Three of Donald’s predecessors as Europe’s captain, Thomas Bjørn, José María Olazábal and Paul McGinley, delivered impassioned speeches to players. Olazábal focused on the spirit of Seve Ballesteros. Bjørn talked of the importance of the traditions handed down by European teams of old. McGinley, whose 2014 captaincy was lauded by all who encountered it, carefully outlined what it takes to prevail against the United States. Players were said to be spellbound by the trio.</p><p>Donald is not the tub-thumping, rabble-rousing type.

<p>The reporter and presenter’s story explores black diasporic life alongside his broadcasting career</p><p>“Black person on the telly!” was a familiar cry in excited black British households in the 1970s and 80s whenever someone who looked like us appeared on screen. Clive Myrie, the BBC news presenter, recounts the same sentiment in <em>Everything </em><em>Is Everything</em>. But in 1994, when it came to reporting on the Notting Hill carnival, if Myrie had his way, that black person would <em>not</em> be him. The ambitious journalist’s reluctance was not a disavowal of his blackness but a manifestation of his unwillingness to be defined – at least in terms of BBC jobs – by his colour.</p><p>In the early 1960s, Myrie’s working-class parents had moved from Jamaica’s tropical sunshine to “the sleety slush” of Boltonian downpours. At university he studied law but, inspired by watching the broadcasters Alan Whicker and Trevor McDonald, Myrie joined the BBC as a trainee radio reporter in
