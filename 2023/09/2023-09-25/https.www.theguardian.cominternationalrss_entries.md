<p>Analysts say that the rise in the movement of oil in contravention of western sanctions is often happening with the full knowledge of the US government</p><p>Hidden within the bone dry ledgers of China’s international trade reports, an apparent anomaly revealed itself in late 2022. Analysts examining the movement of oil around the world located an extraordinary imbalance in the country’s accounts; a bland aberration that helped to reveal the risky game being played by the US and its allies to maintain a high supply of oil around the world.</p><p>It was November 2022 and Chinese imports of Malaysian oil had reached a record high of more than one million barrels a day. The problem? Malaysia’s total national oil production was just 521,000 barrels a day, almost half of the amount China claimed it was importing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/sep/25/the-trade-in-sanctioned-oil-is-booming-as-the-us-turns-a-blind-eye">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Four size-diverse fashion industry workers share what they look for in a pair of jeans – and where they’ve found the right fit</p><p>Jeans are notoriously hard to shop for. Finding a pair that fits our unique proportions without any weird fabric bunches, gapes at the waist or pinches at the hips can be oddly emotionally draining. Especially since denim jeans are perpetually in style, while the trends that dictate its silhouette are ever changing (skinny, straight, boyfriend, baggy).</p><p>When you add the fashion industry’s baffling focus on sizing that’s well below the average person’s size in most western countries, it’s a miracle any of us ever find a pair of jeans that fits.

After just seven games in charge, Marcelino resigned as Marseille manager last week in response to what he called “intimidation, threats, insults and slander”. The Spaniard became the fourth Marseille coach to resign in less than three years and he is not the first to do so under duress from the club’s volatile fanbase. Marseille, so often their own worst enemies, routinely implode and start again.

<p>Breadcrumbed chicken, parmesan, tomato sauce and stringy mozzarella: an old favourite that always tastes as good as you remember</p><p>One of the first Italian restaurants I visited was in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire. I was with my uncle’s wife, Clare, whose stylish sister Alison was going out with Vito, whose family owned the restaurant. The tables had red and white checkered tablecloths, and on each was a tall glass filled with even taller packets of breadsticks, several of which I took and crushed on the way home – the clearest memory of an evening almost four decades ago! A vague memory is of eating breadcrumbed chicken and tomato sauce, then neat balls of gelato.</p><p>Years later, the Italian American boyfriend of a girl I waitressed with explained that for it to be <em>parm,</em> the chicken must be on the sauce and topped with slices of mozzarella or, better still, provolone, which I had never heard of.

<p>The writer’s alternative history – a thriller set in a 1920s US with a huge and thriving Native American population – underlines the range and power of his imagination</p><p>In his 1953 novel, <em>Bring the Jubilee</em>, Ward Moore imagined an alternative history in which General Lee won the battle of Gettysburg and became the president of a Confederate America. It’s a fine story, although, like many books in the genre, the author is forced to spend an uncomfortable amount of narrative time doling out chunks of information to his reader: setting in place what has changed – and, crucially, what has not – as a result of the nudge given to history. It was a problem that beset Laurent Binet more recently in <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/apr/29/civilisations-by-laurent-binet-review-counterfactual-hi-jinks">Civilisations</a></em>, which imagined what would have happened had the Spanish failed in their attempts to conquer South America.
