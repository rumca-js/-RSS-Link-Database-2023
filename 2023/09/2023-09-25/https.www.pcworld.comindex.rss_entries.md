<p>Until now, Intel&rsquo;s public stance has been that its Core Ultra (or &ldquo;Meteor Lake&rdquo;) chip will simply be a mobile processor. But that&rsquo;s not true, the general manager of Intel&rsquo;s Client Computing Division confirmed recently.</p>



<p>In an interview with Michelle Johnston Holthaus, the executive vice president who oversees Intel&rsquo;s processor division, she confirmed (and re-confirmed) that a desktop version of Meteor Lake would debut in 2024. &ldquo;You are confirming Meteor Lake desktop?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Holthaus replied.</p>

<p>Forget <em>Starfield, Baldur&rsquo;s Gate 3,</em> or [insert the game that you&rsquo;re currently playing here]. The big story in the game industry over the last week has been Unity and how the makers of the cross-platform engine have <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2069121/unity-has-done-the-impossible-united-gamers-and-developers-against-it.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">pissed off pretty much everyone</a>. On Friday, Unity issued an update a little over a week after announcing a new per-install fee structure that would have drastically increased costs for developers large and small. Following the near-universal outcry, Unity has scaled back some &mdash; but not all &mdash; of the planned changes. </p>



<p>Most importantly, the free tier of the Unity engine will not automatically charge game developers a fee for every installation o

<p>If you&rsquo;re in the market for a swanky everyday laptop, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place.

Between the powerful hardware inside and the sharp 1800p display, it&rsquo;s a great machine for office work or day-to-day use. There&rsquo;s even a user-facing 1080p webcam, which is perfect for videoconferencing calls. Believe me, as someone who works from home, 1080p is the resolution you want. Otherwise, you end up looking kind of blurry.</p>



<p>The Lenovo 14 Slim 7 features an Intel Core i7-1260P CPU, Intel Iris Xe graphics, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of SSD storage. That&rsquo;s more than enough power for checking e-mail, spre

<p>You have a table on paper but need the data listed in Excel? Fortunately, there&rsquo;s a simple trick for importing data on physical papers (or any other images) into Excel spreadsheets.</p>



<p>Take your smartphone and take a photo of the data, then send the photo to your PC via email, OneDrive, flash drive, or any other manner. Once the picture is on your PC, open Excel, select the <em>Data</em> tab and then the command <em>From Picture &gt; Picture from File</em> from the &ldquo;Retrieve and Transform Data&rdquo; area. </p>

<p>The principle behind liquid cooling your PC parts is pretty simple: cool liquid comes in, pulls heat from the component, warm liquid moves out, fans cool it down and expel hot air outside the PC case. One of the essential components is the heat plate that spreads across the CPU or GPU, effectively transferring heat to the liquid. Now there&rsquo;s a new innovation in plate design that might just be the future.

<p>An attack on your Wi-Fi network is not like a bank robbery: Instead of masked robbers blowing open the vault with a loud noise, a hacker inconspicuously approaches the router, searches for weak points and tries out several attack paths. Or he exploits a known security hole by unleashing an attack on the router that has been prepared for this purpose.</p>



<p>Because you never know when and where your router will become a target, you should always ensure that the device is protected against hacker attacks: Increase the protection level of the router with suitable settings so that an attack is too costly for the hacker. And keep yourself regularly informed about security gaps so that you can plug them with firmware updates. </p>



<p>We show you how the most dangerous Wi-Fi network attacks work and how you can protect yourself against them: This means you immed
