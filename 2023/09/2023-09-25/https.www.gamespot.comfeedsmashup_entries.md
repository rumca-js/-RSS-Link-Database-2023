When faced with death, people are exposed for who they truly are, which can be startling and terrifying, or heartfelt and affirming. Everything and anything is possible; from chilling revelations spilled in an isolated clearing as the world ends, to gripped fingers and hands, squeezed tight, after learning that everything is somehow going to work out alright.

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dark-and-darker/">Dark and Darker</a> may have been the game to popularize extraction-style dungeon crawlers, but it certainly won't be the last. Two extremely similar games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/greed-is-good/">Greed is Good</a> and Project Crawl, are both holding Steam playtests this week.</p><p dir="ltr">All three titles, at first glance, appear almost identical. Like Dark and Darker, players in Project Crawl and Greed is Good can team up to venture into a dangerous dungeon in search of treasure, in the process battling to overcome both monsters and teams of other players as a shrinking battle royale-esque circle forces players into closer proximity as a match progresses.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">It's clear Greed is Good and Project Crawl look to have been heavily "inspired" by the work developer Ironmace has done with its own first-person slasher, mimicking everything from Dark and Darker's user interface t

<p dir="ltr">Just in case you were wondering, director Martin Scorsese still has a bone to pick with franchise culture in cinema--specifically with comic-book movies. In an extensive interview with <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/martin-scorsese-profile">GQ</a>, Scorsese, 80, discussed those enduring topics--which have long been a sticking point for him--and his future career aspirations.</p><p dir="ltr">When asked about the prevalence of blockbusters, Scorsese voiced concerns about their influence on audiences less inclined to seek out alternative forms of cinema. "The danger there is what it's doing to our culture," Scorsese said. "Because there are going to be generations now that think movies are only those--that's what movies are."</p><p dir="ltr">GQ suggested that these beliefs might already be in circulation, a notion Scorsese agreed with adding, "Which means that we have to then fight back stronger.
