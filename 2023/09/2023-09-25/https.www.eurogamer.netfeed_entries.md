Vampire Survivors developer Poncle has said it's "investigating" the possibility of adding proper online multiplayer co-op to its conspicuously vampire-free minimalist survival RPG, although there's no guarantee it'll actually happen.
</p><p>
That tiny nugget of information comes via a new <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/16rsuh0/vampire_survivors_ama_with_developers_poncle/">Ask me Anything (AMA) Q&amp;A session</a>, held earlier today on Reddit, in which Poncle occasionally had the opportunity to answer questions that weren't variations on 'Where the bloody hell are the vampires anyway, please?'.

One such question inquired if there were any multiplayer plans for Vampire Survivors beyond the four-player couch co-op mode <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-now-has-couch-co-op-

Naughty Dog has announced it'll be celebrating The Last of Us Day - its annual hat tip to the community - again this year, but has warned fans not to expect any game or TV show news.
</p><p>
This year's The Last of Us Day (which, if you're unfamiliar, happens on 26th September to commemorate the in-game date the Cordyceps infection reached critical mass) coincides with the series' tenth anniversary, meaning some fans were hoping developer Naughty Dog might have a few extra-special reveals to mark the occasion. 
</p><p>
Unfortunately, in a <a href="https://x.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1706352928183799906?s=20">tweet</a> clearly intended to manage expectations ahead of time, Naughty Dog wrote, "We're celebrating with a The Last of Us Day stream tomorrow... featuring announcements focused on art, merch, and more.

Two weeks after getting its first small update, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-guides-tips-tricks-9352">Starfield</a> has just recieved another, this one focusing on performance and stability, as well as remedying a number of gameplay issues.
</p><p>
All-in-all, it's not a particularly glamorous update, equating to a grand total of ten bullet points in Bethesda's patch notes, but if you've been experiencing the likes of characters not appearing where they should be, blurry textures, or a hitch-y hand scanner, this one's for you.
</p><p>
Full patch details can be found below, and for those wondering when Bethesda might have something more substantial to bring to Starfield, the developer says it's "continuing to work on [the] larger update" that - as we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-getting-dlss-suppor

Following a tumultuous week for Unity, in which the company infuriated a significant portion of the development community by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-reveals-plans-to-charge-per-game-install-drawing-criticism-from-development-community">making dramatic changes to its engine licensing terms</a> - only to then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-announces-significant-changes-to-its-controversial-new-pricing-plan">partially walk them back</a> - at least one developer has had enough, announcing it'll no longer be porting its acclaimed game to Switch as a direct consequence of Unity's actions.

Last Tuesday, Unity announced changes to its licensing agreement that would have forced developers to pay an additional fee every time a user installed their game. After significant outrage

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-guides-tips-tricks-9352">Starfield</a> already hosts hundreds of mods created by the game's community, designed to tweak Bethesda's sci-fi exploration RPG in all sorts of ways. 
</p><p>
But how many of those have been suggested by Bethesda itself? And how often is it the studio actually encourages one of its games' bugs to be reintroduced?
</p><p>
Step up Bethesda level designer Zach Wilson, who revealed on X, formerly Twitter, that an early build of Starfield had its cute little hoover robots "incorrectly flagged as human civilians".

Development of Quantic Dream's Star Wars Eclipse is "simmering", the studio has said, suggesting further details are still a ways off.
</p><p>
The game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heavy-rain-developer-quantic-dream-reveals-star-wars-eclipse">first announced back in 2021</a> at The Game Awards, but few details have been disclosed since then beyond its High Republic setting.

At the Tokyo Game Show last week, Quantic Dream's vice president of marketing Lisa Pendse was asked for an update on the game's development.

KOTOR 2 released on 8th June 2023 for Switch. It was initially advertised with plans to add a fan-made mod which restores content to the original game as DLC. On 3rd June 2023, Aspyr annou

Firstly, I'd like to apologise to the team at Inflexion Games. I happen to share my name with their forthcoming gaslamp survival fantasy - to the extent they've had to mute me on social media so my silly little posts don't get in the way of them looking at what people are saying about Nightingale. 
</p><p>
And there's plenty to say, especially after I was able to get a good tour of its systems back at Gamescom, and a peek at its beautiful world. It certainly looks the part, with some of the most gorgeously shimmering water and realistic wave physics I've seen. There are spectacular magic effects from player and enemy alike, and vibrant, hyper-realistic lighting.
</p><p>
The world feels unique - with fantasy tropes such as fairies and magic and colossal beasts explored by a character suited and booted like a Victorian,

Video game creation platform Roblox has laid off 30 staff in the company's talent acquisition team, as hiring slows.
</p><p>
The layoffs come following a period of dramatic growth for the game, which now commands 250 million monthly active users - more than Fortnite and Minecraft combined.

Reporting on the layoffs, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/21/roblox-cuts-30-on-talent-acquisition-team-as-hiring-slows/">Techcrunch</a> said it believed the changes reflected a greater push within Roblox - which operates at a net loss - to focus in on its bottom line, which is heavily affected the growing sums it pays developers on its platform.

The arrival of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-players-endure-second-consecutive-day-of-server-issues-preventing-them-from-playing">Payday 3 has been plagued by server problems</a>, leaving the game inaccessible at various times across its launch weekend.
</p><p>
Payday 3 was released on Thursday last week for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, including via Xbox Game Pass. But as player numbers climbed, the game quickly got into problems. 
</p><p>
Now, in a statement issued this morning, the boss of Payday 3 developer Starbreeze said he was "disappointed" in how his company's big new launch had landed - and largely pointed the finger at an unnamed third-party matchmaking service for causing the game to fall over.

## After playing KallaX, I’m a pro at putting together furniture

I don&rsquo;t want to brag, but my sister and I think of ourselves as somewhat seasoned co-op professionals. We grew up playing games together, turning games which weren&rsquo;t even meant to be played in co-op into multiplayer experiences (like splitting a controller in half to play Tekken 3&rsquo;s Force mode). So when I heard about KallaX, a co-op game about aliens building furniture in space, I wondered whether we&rsquo;d be able to master the art of assembly.
</p><p>
You see, KallaX gives you instructions like you&rsquo;d expect of its Swedish namesake (Kallax are those cube shelving units sold by IKEA that have practically invaded every house on the planet), but only one person can look at the manual at a time. No crowding around an A5-sized booklet and bumping shoulders to figure out minimalistic diagrams, but a re
