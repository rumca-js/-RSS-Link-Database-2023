Last week, Cuban authorities said they had arrested 17 people over a human trafficking ring that allegedly had lured young Cuban men to serve in the Russian military. The Cuban ambassador to Moscow, Julio Antonio Garmendia Pena said: “We have nothing against Cubans who just want to sign a contract and legally take part with the Russian army in this operation. But we are against illegality and these operations that have nothing to do with the legal field,” RIA quoted the ambassador as saying.</p><p><strong>Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy is e

The only question is which of the Aaronson siblings will get there first</p><p>That cliche about a year being a long time in football? You don’t need to tell that to the Aaronson brothers. This time last year the younger of the two, Paxten, told NBC that it was “a surreal experience” watching his big brother, Brenden, starring for Leeds United in the Premier League matches he’d been watching on TV for years. You could sense not just the pride in his voice and demeanour, but genuine awe.</p><p>It had all been about Brenden, the elder by almost three years. Since building his reputation in MLS with Philadelphia Union, his ascent had been dizzying. His transfer to Red Bull Salzburg, signed off in October 2020 for a fee with the potential to rise to $9m, was a record for a homegrown Union player.

<p>A writer struggles after becoming a mother in this vibrant, genre-busting study of the divided self</p><p>The Danish author Olga Ravn would have been a teenager when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/mar/21/biography.women" title="">Rachel Cusk’s 2001 memoir</a>, A Life’s Work: On Becoming a Mother, was first published. Cusk’s intense, elegant description of one woman’s experience marked the beginning of a wave of important writing on the subjective, often ambivalent interior world of early motherhood. Ravn’s rangy, unsettled new autofiction, My Work, is not unusual in folding a knowledgable, articulate discussion of this work into a real-time analysis of its own intimate story. But that story, told across a range of forms, is at once irrepressibly lively and painfully elusive. The strength of this book is the way that it dramatises a gap between explanation and lived experience. Our culture, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/20/mothers-jacqueline-r

<p>From the atom bomb to AI, this semi-fictional oral history explores science, faith and madness through the ideas of one extraordinary physicist</p><p>The opening chapter of Benjamín Labatut’s second novel is such a perfect distillation of his technique that it could serve as a manifesto. One morning in 1933, Austrian physicist Paul Ehrenfest pays a visit to his disabled child, Vassily. Ehrenfest has enjoyed a dazzling career, but recently has been seized by despair. Nazism is the most urgent threat, but Ehrenfest is troubled too by a less tangible development: the quantum revolution, most notably the work of Hungarian wunderkind John von Neumann. Ehrenfest experiences this new theoretical direction as a kind of unravelling, a fog of “logical contradictions, uncertainties, and indeterminacies” he feels entirely unable to penetrate. Having moved his son to Amsterdam, Ehrenfest has shielded him from the horrors of the Nazi regime. What he cannot protect him from, though, is the quant
