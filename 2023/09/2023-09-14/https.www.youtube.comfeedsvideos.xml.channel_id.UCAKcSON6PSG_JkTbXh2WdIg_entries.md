The incomparable Mitski performed at The Current five years ago, and killed it on this version of “Nobody.” So excited for ‘The Land Is Inhospitable and So Are We.”

Los Angeles-based folk-punk musician Sunny War — born Sydney Lyndella Ward — is known for her virtuosic guitar playing accompanied by deeply honest lyrics reflecting 21st century concerns. From playing in smaller Americana scenes to being on multiple late-night shows in the past year, Ward’s journey in music has been nothing less than fruitful.

Her latest album, "Anarchist Gospel," explores resiliency and deep reflection, as it’s wrapped up in a bow of lush harmonic music with strong roots in Americana and folk. 

Before her show at the Turf Club in St. Paul, Sunny War stopped by The Current studio to share some songs from her newest album and to talk about her start in music — involving a quirky and distinctive band name. Watch the full session above.
