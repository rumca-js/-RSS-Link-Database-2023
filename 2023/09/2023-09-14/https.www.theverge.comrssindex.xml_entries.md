  <p id="fCv8l6">I was thrilled when Threads <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/22/23840441/meta-threads-web-app">finally launched on the web in August</a>, but I quickly found that it was missing one important feature: you couldn’t quote posts, only repost them. (In X / Twitter lingo, that translates to quote tweet and retweet.) But that’s now changing, as Instagram Adam Mosseri said Thursday that <a href="https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/CxLs2cwvdCn">quote posts on the web were rolled out this week</a>.</p>

<p id="yNxauz">The new DLC invites you to see what has happened to Inkopolis Square, the city featured in <em>Splatoon 2. </em>As you traverse the Spire of Order, you can continue to level up your abilities by adding upgrades to run speed, splash damage, and more. The new mode also features damage counters that appear when you splat your enemies, which seem a bit distracting at first glance.</p>

  <p id="OfWrZ8">This week, Apple confirmed longstanding rumors that it was finally abandoning the Lightning connector for USB-C with the debut of its iPhone 15 and 15 Pro phones. The connector’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23312359/apple-iphone-lightning-cable-anniversary-10-years">decade-long run</a> might be over, but that doesn’t mean you need to toss out all your Lightning cables — not yet, anyway.</p>
<p id="a9Trbs">There are still a number of products in Apple’s vast catalog that haven’t made the switch, and it’s a safe bet that many of them are due for USB-C refreshes in the near future. Here’s a list of

  <p id="Rsb6hn">Over the past few years, companies across the PC space have been engaged in a slow, but steady race to build a foldable laptop that people might actually want to buy. Various companies have thrown their hats in the ring. Lenovo has done a foldable ThinkPad. Asus did a foldable Zenbook. And HP, not to be left out, is giving a foldable the old college try with its HP Spectre Fold. </p>
<p id="MHx7so">The Spectre Fold, HP claims, is the world’s thinnest and smallest 17-inch foldable PC. The competition is not necessarily particularly steep here — there are very few of these 17-inch fold

  <p id="uGjbMu">Strike fever is about to sweep through the nation’s auto industry, with the United Auto Workers preparing to walk off the job on September 14th if the “Big Three” automakers — Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler’s parent company, Stellantis — don’t agree to the union’s demands for pay increases, shorter working days, and stronger pensions. </p>
<p id="eMxlGC">A simultaneous strike of all three major automakers has never happened, but it has been brewing since at least the Great Recession of 2008 when union workers agreed to major concessions in their contract to help keep the car companies from filing Chapter 11. Still, a strike could significantly impac

This is a world filled with monsters, and your job is to hunt them. But what makes the series so engrossing is the gameplay loop tied to those hunts: the way you prepare by collecting the right gear, weapons, and potions; how you spend time studying your target before heading into battle; and finally, using the downed monster to craft better gear so you can take on even more challenging beasts. It’s a long and involved process but also one that feels so satisfying when you p
