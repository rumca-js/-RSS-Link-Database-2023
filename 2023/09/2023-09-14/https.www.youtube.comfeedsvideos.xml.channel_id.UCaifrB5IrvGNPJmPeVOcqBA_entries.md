*An edited, illustrated and narrated playthrough of the game Dwarf Fortress*

 We feast! It's high time we enjoy the fruits of our labor, dwarves. How about some music, too? I think some instruments are in order as well!

 Of course, we can't feast forever..a devil lurks below and a solution must be found..
