<p>The Windows 11 Photos app is testing a pair of key AI-powered features, continuing a surprising and welcome renaissance in Microsoft&rsquo;s multimedia apps.</p>



<p>Microsoft said Thursday that the Photos app is adding background blur, the &ldquo;portrait mode&rdquo; that&rsquo;s become common smartphones. Even better, the OneDrive app now has smarter search capabilities for photos, so that you&rsquo;ll be able to search by the content of the picture, such as a beach scene or &ldquo;snow.&rdquo;</p>



<p>We criticized Microsoft earlier this year for the fact the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1477261/windows-11s-old-photos-app-is-still-better.html">old Photos app was better than the new one</a>. And in some sense, it is: in Photos Legacy, you can search for content, such as the previously mentioned beach scenes. Provided that you&rsquo;ve connected

<p>If you&rsquo;ve been following the game industry over the last few days, you might have heard that Unity, the creators of the far-reaching game engine of the same name, have made a bit of a mess. A new scheme to start charging developers every time a Unity engine-based game gets installed on a PC or console has indeed united gamers, developers, and publishers&hellip;in condemnation of this boneheaded bit of naked profiteering.  </p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s the gist. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blog.unity.com/news/plan-pricing-and-packaging-updates&amp;xcust=2-1-2069121-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Starting January 1st, 2024</a>, all games that use the Unity engine will be charged 20 cents (USD) for each game installation, once it hits a threshold of 200,000 downloads and $200,

<p>Traveling often involves taking along multiple devices&mdash;smartphone, tablet, laptop, and the like. But you won&rsquo;t always have access to a wall outlet to charge all, or even any, of them. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to add a power bank to your pack. But with so many options available, how do you know which power bank best suits your needs? Everything from various charging specs, to different ports, to the included cables need to be considered before making a purchase.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s where we come in. We&rsquo;ve tested a ton of power banks from different manufacturers spanning the range of available price points and specs. We&rsquo;ve curated a list of our favorites to help you find the best value.

<p>New Chromebooks will now ship with ten years&rsquo; worth of security patches and updates, Google said Thursday, helping ease a persistent problem: the limited lifespan of Chromebook hardware.</p>



<p>Google will also support Chromebooks that were released in 2019 or later by an additional two years, also giving them ten years of patches and updates, Google said.</p>



<p>Windows PCs don&rsquo;t last forever, but Microsoft traditionally has never placed an end-of-life date on a Windows PC until 2021, when it limited <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394763/windows-11-system-hardware-requirements.html">some older PCs from upgrading to Windows 11</a>. One of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/402141/chromebooks-versus-windows-laptops-which-should-you-buy.html">differences between laptops and Chromebooks</a> is that Google actually tells you whe

<p>A few years ago, &ldquo;Threadripper&rdquo; was synonymous with the absolute top end of home-built PCs. The extra sub-brand of Ryzen processors, like &ldquo;Stingray&rdquo; to the Corvette, pushed AMD&rsquo;s hardware to the limit. But there hasn&rsquo;t been a Threadripper chip on a high-end consumer socket as <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398373/amd-threadripper-3970x-review-32-cores-of-unbeatable-power.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">since the 3000 series in 2019</a>. And while rumors of a new Threadripper with a jaw-dropping 96 processor cores are exciting, they come with the sting of knowing that you won&rsquo;t be able to stick it into a regular gaming PC. </p>



<p>But down to brass tacks. According to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/momomo_us/status/1701968938442043703&amp;x

<p>If you&rsquo;re on the hunt for a swanky new laptop, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place. Dell&rsquo;s XPS line of laptops are luxurious, lightweight, and powerful, with the XPS 13 in particular sometimes called the Windows equivalent to Apple&rsquo;s vaunted MacBook Air. Luckily for you, Dell&rsquo;s selling the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/deals-for-business/xps-13-laptop/spd/xps-13-9315-laptop/xn9315gmmks&amp;xcust=2-1-2068933-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">XPS 13 for just $649</a>, which is a savings of $150. </p>



<p>That&rsquo;s a fantastically low price for a premium Windows machine. Thanks to the hardware inside, the Dell XPS 13 is more than capable of blasting through office work as well as day-to-day tasks. It also weighs just 2.9 pounds, making it the p

<p>A severe vulnerability has been found in libwebp, a code library used to render webp images, reports <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://stackdiary.com/critical-vulnerability-in-webp-codec-cve-2023-4863/&amp;xcust=2-1-2068973-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Stack Diary</a>. Webp is a popular image format used by many sites on the Internet &ndash; but also by apps and some other software that use web views &ndash; and the vulnerability can be used, among other things, to run malicious code on affected devices. Worse yet, it is reportedly being actively exploited by malicious attackers.</p>



<p>The vulnerability has been labelled CVE-2023-4863 and is considered extremely serious. Major browsers such as Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera, Vivaldi, and Brave have already released security fixes. To make su

<p>Today, HP&rsquo;s yanking back the velvet curtain and revealing the Spectre Foldable PC, a new 3-in-1 device that switches from a tablet to a laptop or desktop. We love innovation here at PCWorld and although we&rsquo;ve seen our fair share of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/917881/best-2-in-1-laptops.html">2-in-1 laptops</a> before, we don&rsquo;t see many 17-inch ones with detachable keyboards, especially with a portion of the screen being foldable. </p>



<p>HP claims it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;thinnest 17-inch foldable PC&rdquo; and while we haven&rsquo;t tested it yet to confirm, it does weigh an impressive 2.9 pounds without the keyboard. That slots it right into the ultraportable category. Let&rsquo;s dive right into the details then, as I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re dying to know what&rsquo;s under the hood.</p>

<p>While Windows 10 will not receive any new features until its end of support in October 2025, Microsoft will continue to provide Windows 11 with innovations &mdash; and not only with the next major yearly upgrade to version 23H3 in autumn. Initially thought to be an exception, interim feature updates called &ldquo;Moments&rdquo; are now standard. </p>



<p>The first major feature update of this year brought something almost revolutionary with the<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1528312/windows-11-features-march-2023-quality-update-bing-ai-iphone.html"> integration of Bing AI Chat</a>.
