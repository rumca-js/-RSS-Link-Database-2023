	Democrats have a likability problem. It's so bad that the unlikable Nancy Pelosi found herself defending the less likable Joe Biden on CNN, where she avoided saying the even less likable Kamala Harris should be Biden's running mate in 2024.
</p><p>
	If you're a political hack, it should be a simple answer to a question that literally gets asked every presidential cycle.
</p><p>
	Q: Should the president keep the vice president as their running mate?
</p><p>
	A: Yes.
</p><p>
	Instead, Nancy could barely even muster up a "Biden thinks so, and that's what matters" before tossing the word salad.
