It’s the beans game - and a review that’s something of a cursed chalice for team SU&amp;SD - a filming session where seemingly everything went wrong based on half a script excavated from a Google Drive. Bohnanza is a game near and dear to Tom’s heart, and hopefully this fully unhinged first half and ponderous second makes for a compelling case as to why this horrible yellow box deserves a spot in your collection.
