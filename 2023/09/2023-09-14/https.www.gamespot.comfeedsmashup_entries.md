<p>One of the recent bangers out of Bandai Namco was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tales-of-arise/">Tales of Arise</a>, which launched back in September 2021. And two years later, the action-RPG is getting new story DLC content, subtitled Beyond the Dawn. The reveal trailer premiered on Sony's most recent State of Play livestream and gave some details on what it's about, and gave a launch date--Tales of Arise: Beyond the Dawn has a release date of November 9, 2023.</p><p>The story takes place one year after the war between Dahna and Rena, which are the realms the original Tales of Arise takes place in. Beyond the Dawn stars the same cast of party members but also focuses on a newcomer named Nazamil. Apparently she's being chased by Dahnans since her father is a lord. Of course, there's much more behind the new unassuming character.</p><div>          </div><p>There was plenty of gameplay in the trailer, which showed each party member's new abilities in combat.

<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the second title in the ongoing Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, now has a release date. Revealed as PlayStation's September State of Play, the highly anticipated RPG is now scheduled to release February 29, 2024.</p><p>Square Enix announced the release date alongside a trailer filled with characters, locations, and minigames players of the original game will be very familiar, such as Cait Sith, Vincent Valentine, Kalm, Junon, The Golden Saucer, and more. It also confirmed the game will feature Chocobo racing, Chocobo breeding, and showdowns against the series' iconic Weapons.</p><p>Based on the footage we've seen so far, Rebirth appears to pick off directly where Remake ended, with Cloud, Tifa, Barret, Aerith, and Red XIII headed towards the small town of Kalm. However, Square Enix has not yet stated approximately where in the original storyline the game might end, but did announce it will take around 100 hours to complete.</p><a href="https://www.game

The main series has included 16 numbered entries (not counting a few sequels to those games), and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-final-fantasy-games-ranked/2900-4038/">we've ranked them all</a>. But for every numbered Final Fantasy, there are two more spin-offs. The Final Fantasy name is much broader than the mainline games, lending its beloved characters, creatures, and settings to rhythm games, racing games, action-focused adventures, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a dizzying number of Final Fantasy spin-offs, but we wanted to narrow down only the very best. Keep in mind that these are spin-offs of the Final Fantasy series itself, not individual games within the series. That means you won't see direct sequels or

Black Manta, a sort of sub-villain from the first movie with an intense personal vendetta against Aquaman after Aquaman killed his pirate dad, is bringing the heat against Atlantis. And Aquaman is going to have to team up with his half-brother Orm, who was the bad guy in the first movie, to figure out how to deal with whatever Black Manta has planned.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the bad year DC has had thus f

<p dir="ltr">Horror maestro John Carpenter is set to send shivers down viewers' spines with his latest, John Carpenter's Suburban Screams, a six-part unscripted series headed to Peacock. Carpenter has been away from the director's chair for a while, so the October 13 premiere of the anthology show definitely qualifies as appointment viewing.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">Inspired by real life tales from actual survivors, Suburban Screams is packed with tales about maniacs in bunny suits haunting the night and menacing haunted houses that threaten entire families. A synopsis elaborates that "each episode focuses on one true tale of terror…are brought to life through premium cinematic scene-work, news clips, home photos, and archival footage, combining the visual language of horror films with the tools and techniques of documentaries, creating a uniquely frightening experience for viewers." So much for the veneer of a seemingly peaceful, quiet life in the suburbs. Check out the

<p>Supergiant Games announced that Hades II will enter early access in Q2 2024. Details about date, pricing, and system requirement will be revealed closer to that time.</p><p>Supergiant claims that Hades II will release day one with at least as much content as the first game had when it launched in early access on Steam. This is notable because Hades initially launched in early access on the Epic Game Store in 2018 and came to Steam a year later. The full version then released in September 2020. Basically, Hades II's early access period will start with more content than the original Hades started with when it launched in early access on Steam.</p><p>Supergiant said in <a href="https://www.supergiantgames.com/blog/hades-ii-development-update/">a blog post</a> that, "We believe the timeframe we're planning for will be the "sweet spot" where the game is far enough along that player feedback won't mostly consist of stuff we already know isn't there yet, but isn't so far along that it's

<p>We finally have our first real look at Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, thanks to this morning's theatrical trailer for the long-awaited sequel. And it looks like it could very well end up being worth that extended wait.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer opens with Arthur setting the stage. "Four years ago I was basically unemployed. Now I'm a husband and a father," he narrates, as we see little baby Aquaman Jr. He's also no longer unemployed, as we know--he's the king of Atlantis. But all is not necessarily well. Check out the trailer below.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">Enter Black Manta, still out for revenge after Aquaman killed his father at the beginning of the last movie. "I'm gonna kill Aquaman and destroy everything he holds dear. I'm gonna murder his family, and burn his kingdom to ash." To do so, he's got some new toys that we see in the trailer, like a sick new undersea mantis ship, and more importantly a glowing new black trident, which has given him some new powers.</p

Through several updates over the years, critical issues were addressed to get it in a playable and stable state for those who faced the worst problems. But the 2.0 update, launching alongside the release of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phantom-liberty-rewrites-cyberpunk-2077s-dna/1100-6515050/">Phantom Liberty</a> expansion, is a more fundamental one--a rebuild of Cyberpunk 2077's very gameplay foundation.</p><p dir="ltr">If you were in the camp that was underwhelmed by the RPG mechanics of the original version, where progression felt somewhat inconsequential in terms of influencing your playstyle and effectively building your character, this update is a strong and confident answer to that. It completely revamps

<p>Before the first trailer for Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom was shown publicly, Warner Bros showed the trailer to members of the press at an event on Wednesday, with director James Wan presenting. Speaking and fielding questions for nearly a half-hour, Wan touched on nearly every major talking point about the film--including how the sequel will be handling Amber Heard's character, and how it accommodates, or ignores, all the changes happening at DC Studios lately.</p><p dir="ltr">Chief among those changes being that James Gunn and producer Peter Safran are now running the show at DC, and are in the process of rebooting the big-screen DC universe--an effort that has seemingly become more urgent after a bunch of disappointing box office performances in a row for what should be a juggernaut of a franchise. Since it's a sequel to a movie that came out five years ago, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom would appear to be a vestige of the existing franchise, rather than a part of whatever's nex

<p>The John Wick TV mini-series, The Continental, releases on September 22, but you don't have to wait another minute to get a fresh look at the show.</p><p>No one should be surprised that a John Wick show has some great action set-pieces, and that's exactly how the series begins. Peacock released the 3.5-minute opening fight sequence, showing a young Winston (Colin Woodell) fighting his way out of the hotel. We don't want to give too much away, as it's best seen not knowing what happens. Take a look:</p><div>          </div><p>The Continental is a three-part mini-series that follows a young Winston Scott in a story set in 1970s New York City that digs into the origins of the Continental hotel. "Winston charts a deadly course through the hotel’s mysterious underworld in a harrowing attempt to seize the hotel where he will eventually take his future throne," reads a line from the show's description.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/watch-the-action-packed-opening-sequence

<p>Mario and friends can dish out more damage in the upcoming Super Mario RPG remake thanks to some new battle mechanics. Nintendo highlighted the updates during the special September Nintendo Direct presentation.</p><p>For starters, a successfully timed attack will lead to Mario, Peach, Geno, and others to damaging all foes before them in the turn-based RPG. Hitting those enemies just right with a button press will also fill up a new action gauge. Once it hits 100%, a Triple Move can be unleashed that switches up depending on the combo of characters used. Nintendo also mentioned that the Super Mario RPG remake will feature post-game boss rematches, adding they'll be more difficult than their standard versions.</p><p>Super Mario RPG was originally released in 1996 for the Super Nintendo. As a partnership with Squaresoft, it was the first time that the character crossed into the RPG genre, and introduced elements like timing-based attacks that have been used throughout later Mario RPG
