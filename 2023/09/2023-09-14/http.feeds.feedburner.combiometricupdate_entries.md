		A data entry error in a database used for facial recognition in Argentina has highlighted problems with the country’s justice system; problems that are made worse by the use of the real-time biometric technology in public, according to <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/buenos-aires-facial-recognition-scandal?utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=274175422&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--Ah-nyLe8nSK0UylajKTO7u9Yubm_-HlqaHDMpUxKBbozfY3SOK5BX6OrTVXnua0SorEyD9n2iAvPZOZHn79leRwenCg&amp;utm_content=274175422&amp;utm_source=hs_email">Wired</a>.

		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>’s National ID Program and Ministry of Education have announced that biometric digital ID has been adopted as the official student ID across educational institutions.

A government release called the official introduction of the digital ID “a critical moment in Ethiopia’s journey toward digitizing and monetizing the education sector.”

The system promises robust identity verification across all academic platforms, as well as improved data protection. It aims to streamline administrative functions with regard to admissions, record management, and the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/ethiopia-biometric-id-card-contract-won-by-madras-security-printers">Fayda</a> digital ID-based licensin

		The wave of fraud suffered by the U.S. during the pandemic through unemployment insurance programs is even higher than previously thought, reaching between $100 billion and $135 billion, according to a new <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-106696">report</a> from the Government Accountability Office (GAO). That total makes up 11 to 15 percent of all such benefits paid out during the public health crisis.

		A digital identity service for healthcare developed by T-Systems has been approved by Germany’s national agency for healthcare system digitalization, Gematik.

The service will allow health cards and digital IDs to be used via a digital wallet on smartphones and other devices, starting in 2024.

German health insurance provider Barmer commissioned T-Systems to build the system to provide and manage digital identity for its 8.7 million policy-holders in 2022.

“The digital identity in healthcare – the Health ID – guarantees security and ensures greater convenience with digital healthcare services,” says Gematik CEO Markus Leyck Dieken. “Insurance policy-holders thus have a central key for health applications such as the electronic patient file, the e-prescription and

		The poor quality of biometrics collected by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) has put the rollout of the PhilSys ID card this year in jeopardy, according to the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT).

<a href="https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/09/13/philsys-ids-digital-version-rollout-stalled-by-poor-data/">BusinessMirror</a> reports that DICT Secretary Ivan John E. Uy says some PSA service providers appear to have used low quality webcams when capturing facial images. The image quality is too low in some cases for the biometric system to match their facial features, he says.

People who must resubmit their biometrics will be contacted by SMS, Uy says. A feature could also be added to the <a href="https://www
