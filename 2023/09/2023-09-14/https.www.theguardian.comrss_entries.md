<p>Starriest ever London fashion week launch testified to editor-in-chief’s contacts book and emphasised city’s heritage and prospects</p><p>There was Stormzy, and there was Shakespeare. There was a tribute to My Fair Lady, and there was Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell. There was opera by Henry Purcell, and hats by Stephen Jones; catsuits by Burberry and comedy by James Corden. A dizzying roster of cameo appearances included actors Damian Lewis, Sienna Miller and Harriet Walter.</p><p>Vogue World, a one-night-only performance at Theatre Royal Drury Lane on Thursday, was far and away the starriest opening night London fashion week has ever seen. The theme of the 37-minute show, linking Eliza Doolittle to Moss and a new Wayne McGregor ballet to a gospel choir, was London.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/sep/15/vogue-worlds-flurry-of-stars-brings-succour-to-londons-arts-and-hope-to-its-fashion">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Christos Nikou’s English-language debut aims to be a sadistically comical treatment of relationship insecurity, but ends up saying little</p><p>Within the first few minutes of Christos Nikou’s sci-fi-inflected satire Fingernails, in which a medical test has been devised to determine whether two subjects are truly in love, viewers will probably ask themselves why anyone would trust the readout of a machine over their own heart. The only feasible motivation presented in the film is that it helps predict the likelihood of divorce in future – but why throw away a good relationship just because a microwave attached to a vintage TV set said so? Rational audiences will quickly conclude that we can’t do better than to follow the nudges of our desires, and pay the magic love science – how does one measure love, anyway? – about as much mind as we would a compatibility quiz in the back of a magazine.

She withholds intimate details in interviews – one journalist was requested not to reveal the name of her cat – and retreated from social media in 2019. The same year, she announced her retirement onstage. She subsequently reconsidered, although a persistent online rumour suggested the ensuing album, her sixth, was another farewell. Pop-facing, trailed by Working for the Knife, a single that seemed to be about not really wanting to return to music, and packaged in a sleeve that depicted her trapped by lines meant to represent her own songs, Laurel Hell was held to be a contractual obligation that, once fulfilled, spelled the end.</p><p>We are hardly talking about Taylor Sw

<p>The BBC’s analysis editor shares his tips on how to communicate with clarity and confidence</p><p>Most of us are not subject to the demands made on TV news journalists such as Ros Atkins. They must, in just hours, familiarise themselves with a topic to which they have not necessarily paid attention until then. They must decide which information is reliable, vivid and important. They must then string these pearls in a logical sequence without gaps, non sequiturs or distractions. And they must deliver this information to camera convincingly, frequently in the face of unexpected glitches. Early in his career, which he chronicles disarmingly, missteps and all, the BBC’s analysis editor developed a technique to catch, sort, grade, clean, fillet, pack and deliver information. This book, The Art of Explanation, explains how he does it.</p><p>Many seven-steps-to and art-of books, however competently written and well meant, are not fully credible: the author often sounds dodgy (award-winni

<p>Ellie, 40, and Bryan, 31, met while she was taking photographs for their local rugby club in 2022. They now live together in Perth, Australia</p><p>When Ellie started taking photos of her children at their local rugby club in Perth, it wasn’t long before someone spotted her talent. “I was asked to take official pictures for the club, featuring some of the senior players,” she says. “It was a new hobby, but it was really nice to be asked to help out.” Having split up with her husband the previous year, she was taking time to focus on her interests, her job as a nurse and, most importantly, her two children, who were then aged six and seven.</p><p>In March 2022 she was approached by Bryan, one of the senior players, at the rugby club. “I had my camera out and he asked me to take a picture of him and his dad,” she says.

The four subheadings for her guidelines were: 1. Don’t Talk During the Show; 2. Be in the Moment; 3. The Audience Have Not Paid to See You; and 4. Have An Amazing Time. The former busker, who had hitherto received a relatively low level of attention despite being championed by Radio 2’s Jeremy Vine, suddenly found herself at the centre of what would, until recently, have been called a Twitterstorm.</p><p>Walker’s post went viral, with more than 1.6m views.

<p>A subtle recut of the original film brings the central couple to the fore in this London-based slice of life as the young lovers struggle to find themselves</p><p>The writer-director Kanchi Wichmann’s keen-eyed portrait of a doomed lesbian couple stagnating amid the sex, drugs and indie rock of early 21st century east London felt strikingly fresh when it was released 12 years ago. Now, it has acquired the pleasing whiff of a period piece. Most of the characters carry mobile phones, but no one spends their time staring at them, and the soundtrack features the itchy pop squiggles of Micachu and the Shapes several years before frontperson Mica Levi emerged as cinema’s most gifted new composer on Under the Skin, Jackie and Monos.</p><p>Subtly recut to bring the central relationship further into the foreground, the new version looks even more distinctive, not to say unflinching. Musicians Liza (Kat Redstone) and Sally (Sophie Anderson) live in a Hackney flat festooned with fairy lights

<p>A sumptuously filmed adaptation of David Chariandy’s novel tackles heavy-duty issues such as police brutality, racism and closeted desire with a relatively light touch</p><p>“Danger: High Voltage” are among the first words seen on screen in writer-director Clement Virgo’s adaptation of David Chariandy’s 2017 novel. It begins with wannabe DJ/producer Francis (Aaron Pierre) pressuring his younger sibling Michael (Lamar Johnson) to join him in scaling a sinisterly buzzing pylon in their home town of Scarborough, Ontario. The voltage stays at that level throughout much of Brother, which ticks off several films’ worth of heavy-duty subjects – police brutality, racism, the immigrant experience, gang violence, closeted desire, dementia, cancer – and only occasionally verges on the ponderous.</p><p>The question that haunts the film is: what made Francis climb that day? After the opening scene, the action shifts forward a decade to find Michael, his old flame Aisha (Kiana Madeira) and his

<p>An eminent scholar tries to imagine the great playwright’s character and tastes. But can we really know the bard? </p><p>In the epilogue to Stanley Wells’s slim, engaging book, in which he attempts to shed light on Shakespeare’s personality, the eminent academic describes himself as being like Puck to a former colleague’s Oberon. And it’s true that there is something essentially puckish, something creatively mischievous for a man of Wells’s considerable scholarship to claim anything about Shakespeare’s inner life.</p><p>His book comprises four online lectures that were delivered during lockdown in 2020 and closes with a summary of his eight-decade relationship with Shakespeare and the many garlands it has brought him. Compared with the detail of Wells’s own autobiography, what precedes it might seem a little thin.

It is a story, largely, about a miscarriage of justice, but it is also, of course, a story about a dog. A few days before Azaria Chamberlain was snatched by a dingo from the family’s tent near Uluru, a 12-year-old girl was attacked in similar fashion at the same campsite, and survived. “It had her about the elbow,” writes Bryson. “The grip was commanding, painful, and she couldn’t shake it off. The vapour of arrogance in its eyes was unmistakable and terrifying. She screamed for her mother.”</p><p>Dingos aren’t domestic dogs, but at the time of Azaria’s death and her mother’s subsequent arrest for her murder, they weren’t imagined to pose much risk to humans.

But is taking 100 pills a day, finishing your meals by 11am, giving up both alcohol and a social life, really worth it?</p><p>Bryan Johnson knows that you think he is weird. So much of his life occurs outside the realms of what most people consider normal that it would be odd if you didn’t. He rises at 4.30am, eats all his meals before 11am, and goes to bed – alone – at 8.30pm, without exception. In the intervening hours, he ingests more than 100 pills, bathes his body in LED light, and sits on a high-intensity electromagnetic device that he believes will strengthen his pelvic floor. This is all done in the service of slowing his rate of ageing until, he hopes, one year of chronological time can pass while his biological age stays the same.
