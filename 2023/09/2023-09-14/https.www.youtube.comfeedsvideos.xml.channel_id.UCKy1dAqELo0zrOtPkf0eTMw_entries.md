Utopia, Sumerian and executive producer Steven Soderbergh present Divinity, a film from writer-director-producer Eddie Alcazar. Set in an otherworldly human existence, scientist Sterling Pierce (Scott Bakula) dedicated his life to the quest for immortality, slowly creating the building blocks of a groundbreaking serum named “Divinity.” Jaxxon Pierce (Stephen Dorff), his son, now controls and manufactures his father’s once-benevolent dream. Society on this barren planet has been entirely perverted by the supremacy of the drug, whose true origins are shrouded in mystery. Two mysterious brothers (Moises Arias and Jason Genao) arrive with a plan to abduct the mogul, and with the help of a seductive woman named Nikita (Karrueche Tran), they will be set on a path hurtling toward true immortality. Divinity opens in theaters October 13.

## Top 10 Comedies of All Time

No joke, ranking the top 10 comedies of all time is difficult. Given that this genre of cinema has been around practically since the birth of moving pictures, this was a particularly challenging list to wrangle. Many IGN editors cast their votes for this one, with the idea also that this would be a balanced showcase. What you'll find here are comedies that have stood the test of time, ones we can safely call "the best comedies of all time." Also, some of these movies are so danged important we can forgive their dated qualities, while others are relatively new but seem destined to go down as among the most hilarious motion pictures ever made. But no matter what kind of sense of humor you have, you're bound to find these films full of thigh-slappers.

Firewall Ultra reviewed by Gabriel Moss on PlayStation VR 2.

Firewall Ultra simultaneously feels like two steps forward and two steps backward. It somehow does just as much right – and wrong – as Firewall: Zero Hour, a VR game that is now over five years old. While its shooting and tactical teamwork feel, look, and sound better than ever, its content is limited and it’s filled with questionable uses of new tech like eye tracking. What it all adds up to is a decent competitive multiplayer shooter that just happens to be in VR, but its awkward controls are a shot in the foot rather than the shot in the arm that the PlayStation VR2 desperately needed.

Journalist and researcher Jaime Maussan uncovered mummified ‘non-human’ being corpses in Peru back in 2017, that were apparently determined to be between 700 and 1,800 years old. This researcher brought the supposed ‘alien corpses’ to Mexican lawmakers during its first congressional hearing on UFOs. With a unanimous decision of YES, Marvel VFX workers have voted to unionize, aiming to form a national VFX Local by the end of the year. This is the first time a sole group of VFX artists have unionized with IATSE. And finally, in celebration of Fist of the North Star, anime fans are receiving a new anime entry into the franchise!

Check out the new trailer for Killers of the Flower Moon, an upcoming film starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, Lily Gladstone, and Jesse Plemons.

At the turn of the 20th century, oil brought a fortune to the Osage Nation, who became some of the richest people in the world overnight. The wealth of these Native Americans immediately attracted white interlopers, who manipulated, extorted, and stole as much Osage money as they could before resorting to murder. Based on a true story and told through the improbable romance of Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Mollie Kyle (Lily Gladstone), Killers of the Flower Moon is an epic Western crime saga, where real love crosses paths with unspeakable betrayal. 

Killers of the Flower Moon is directed by Academy Award winner Martin Scorsese from a screenplay by Eric Roth and Martin Scorsese, based on David Grann’s best-selling book. It is produced by Martin Scorsese, Dan Friedkin, Bradley Thomas, and Daniel Lupi. Leonardo DiCaprio, Ri
