From playing in smaller Americana scenes to being on multiple late-night shows in the past year, Ward\u2019s journey in music has been nothing less than fruitful.\n\nHer latest album, \"Anarchist Gospel,\" explores resiliency and deep reflection, as it\u2019s wrapped up in a bow of lush harmonic music with strong roots in Americana and folk. \n\nBefore her show at the Turf Club in St. Paul, Sunny War stopped by The Current studio to share some songs from her newest album and to talk about her start in music \u2014 involving a quirky and distinctive band name.
