I mean THURSDAY NEWSDAY! Your number one resource for the entire weeks worth of VR news. \n\nokay. well, Unity just pulled an epic fail (pun intended). With a change in revenue models Unity is experiencing a mass exodus. This obviously impacts the entire gaming industry.. but VR in particular I believe is and will be disproportionally affected. Not only are most VR titles from indie developers (those impacted most) but they are also running Unity. \n\nWe just might see a massive shakeup pretty soon here. Unreal Engine and godot rise?\n\nAlso, some pretty substantial Valve Index 2/ Galileo rumors that I just had to talk about. This is a pretty action packed newsday!
