California is poised to be the third state in the U.S. (behind New York and Minnesota) to pass &#8220;right to repair&#8221; legislation after the state&#8217;s Right to Repair Act SB 244 passed 50–0 vote in the Assembly followed by a 38–0 vote in the Senate. Those three states alone comprise roughly 20 percent of all [&#8230;]

One of the things we’ve tried to get across over the years (perhaps unsuccessfully), is that not only are laws to get rid of hate speech almost always abused, they’re also counterproductive in the actual fight against hate. For those who support those laws, they seem to think that without them, that means that there [&#8230;]

Like it or not, there are a lot of unconstitutional harassment laws on the books. While it&#8217;s always nice to see the First Amendment protect speech we like, it&#8217;s just as likely to protect speech we don&#8217;t like. And harassment laws are often written far more broadly than they should be, given the First Amendment [&#8230;]

As we’ve discussed widely, the entire premise of various link tax bills has never made sense. They’re pushed by the media and politicians insisting that Google and Facebook are unfairly “profiting” off of their news. Except that’s never made any sense at all to anyone who looked at the situation carefully. First of all, links [&#8230;]

For decades AT&#38;T has sought to shovel its broadband network upgrade costs on to the shoulders of other companies. It was the primary catalyst for the net neutrality wars, after AT&#38;T made it clear it wanted to (ab)use its monopoly over broadband access to force companies like Google to pay an extra troll toll if [&#8230;]

It&#8217;s been a decade since a federal court declared the New York Police Department&#8217;s stop-and-frisk program (mostly) illegal. Judge Shira Scheindlin, in a 195-page decision, pointed out everything that was wrong with the program, which ignored the &#8220;Terry stop&#8221; parameters defined by the Supreme Court in its 1968 decision to engage in stops of anyone [&#8230;]
