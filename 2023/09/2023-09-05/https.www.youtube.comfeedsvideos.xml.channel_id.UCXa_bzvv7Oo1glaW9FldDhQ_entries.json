Volition is known for its work on the Red Faction and Saints Row franchises. It\u2019s also a studio that has seen its fair share of ups and downs. \n\nWith this video, we take a walk down memory lane and look at the history of Saints Row and what eventually led to the present day where the company doors have been permanently shut down.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETbjA5mDABI", "date_published": "2023-09-05T18:15:01+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/ETbjA5mDABI/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "The Komplete Evolution of SMOKE - Before You Play Mortal Kombat 1", "description": "The Mortal Kombat series spans a dozen mainline entries and multiple timelines, so it\u2019s obvious that the characters that make an appearance in the franchise have evolved with each passing release. \n\nWith this feature, we will be taking a look at the evolution of Tomas Vrbada (better known as Smoke) all the way from his original appearance in Mortal Kombat 2 as a hidden boss fight to his cyberized form in Mortal Kombat 3 to the latest design refresh that we are about to see in Mortal Kombat 1 2023.
