		Despite suffering a brainstem stroke, "Ann" can speak in her own voice using a biometric avatar controlled by her mind.

Ann, whose identity is being obscured to discuss details of her experience, was paralyzed after the stroke and lost the ability to speak at the age of 30.

An implant developed by researchers at University of California, San Francisco and University of California, Berkeley uses voice and face biometrics to generate speech and expression data from Ann's brain signals, according to a <a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2023/08/425986/how-artificial-intelligence-gave-paralyzed-woman-her-voice-back">UCSF article</a>.

		Executives at X (Twitter) say subscribers can volunteer undefined biometrics, but the data will not be taken by X without consent as things stand.

Could it become training fodder for CEO Elon Musk's new toy, <a href="https://x.ai/">xAI</a>, or even a tradable resource?

One of X's corporate feeds says biometrics is <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/au10tix-selfie-biometrics-for-identity-verification-coming-to-x">coming</a> as an optional perk for subscribers who pay for <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-blue">premium</a> X services.
