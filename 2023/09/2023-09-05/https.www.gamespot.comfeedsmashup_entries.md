<p>Whenever any "chief" officer within a company speaks publicly, you can assume that they're speaking in the best interests of the company. It's no different with Ryan Cohen, the CEO of GameStop, who said that he thinks gaming console makers should be required to include optical disc drives on their systems in a <a href="https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1698440106053337444">tweet</a> this weekend.</p><p>"Big win for consumers," Cohen said, replying to a news story about Apple's move toward USB-C charging and away from its proprietary lightning port.

To start, he discussed the developer's reputation of buggy games and why the studio seeks to "embrace chaos." He explained that while Bethseda's games can be buggy, that comes from the developer's emphasize on player freedom. He said, "Of course there are bugs. But does it take away from your experience? Or do you have a consistent, fun game that you just can't stop playing and experimenting with?"</p><p>Hines elaborated with the full story of the shark elevator, "On Neon, a planet covered entirely in water with a city that sits on top of it, we had a bug where a shark was able to ge

<p>Much of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starfield/">Starfield's</a> space exploration revolves around the ability to fast travel, both to different solar systems and to the surface of the galaxy's various planets. However, it is technically possible to manually fly to planets, just with some pretty major caveats.</p><p dir="ltr">The biggest hurdle is it takes a very, very long time. As highlighted in a video by content creator and Sony Santa Monica writer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@charalanahzard/about">Alanah Pearce</a>, it took around 7 hours to manually fly to Pluto after fast traveling to the planet's orbit using Starfield's starter ship. Pearce actually picked Pluto to test the ability to manually fly to planets because it was technically the closest distance after arriving in orbit, and it still took that long. Pearce also had to grapple with the planet moving as it orbited around the Sun, which forced Pearce to periodically adjust course.</p><div>          </

<p>Arriving soon, the next Xbox update will let you stream games directly from your console to Discord and adds platform-wide voice reporting.</p><p>In order to stream to Discord from your console, you will first have to link your Discord account to your Xbox. Once your account is connected, you can press the Xbox button on your controller, head to the Parties &amp; Chats window and select Discord. Then scroll through your servers, select a voice channel, and display your game. Here's hoping the integration is smooth, as it's likely a lot of people will be looking to stream Starfield for their friends.</p><p>The update will also add additional options for variable refresh rate (VRR) to Xbox Series consoles. This feature enables your TV or monitor to adjust its refresh rate to fit the frame rate of the game content. However, it can make movies or TV look weird. Starting with this update, you can adjust VRR so that it won't activate while you are streaming a show or watching a 4K disc.

<p dir="ltr">Most people probably assumed that the smashing success of The Super Mario Bros. Movie gave a Yoshi flutter jump boost to Switch game sales.

<p>If you've been wondering why everyone in Baldur's Gate 3 is itching to jump your bones, it's because they've all been affected... with a mundane programming bug.</p><p>According to an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/baldurs-gate-3-characters-romance-too-easy-cant-avoid-gale-bug/">TheGamer</a>, Baldur's Gate 3 game director Sven Vincke confirmed that romances were buggy at launch. This resulted in many characters confessing love and propositioning far sooner than they were supposed to. Vincke said, "The approval thresholds were too low when we shipped. That's why they were so horny in the beginning. It wasn't supposed to be that way. We've fixed it since, at least for some of them. We're still fixing a few of them."</p><p>Gale was the character most affected by the bug, according to Vincke. He said, "It wasn't intended, especially Gale.

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starfield/">Starfield</a> is playable now for its early access release, and fans have already made some satisfying discoveries about sci-fi RPG from Bethesda Game Studios. One of these is that Starfield has a Lord of the Rings Easter egg, and it's a good one.</p><p>Players can find space potatoes in the world, and inspecting them shows a description that Lord of the Rings fans are surely familiar with. Potatoes in Starfield "can be prepared many ways," the description says. They can be "boiled, mashed, used in a stew--the recipes are nearly limitless."</p><p>That's obviously a reference to Sam's line from The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers where he's describing what potatoes are to Gollum. The "boil 'em, mash' em, stick 'em in a stew" line has become a meme over the years, and now Starfield is getting in on the action.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-has-a-wonderful-lord-of-the-rings-easter-egg/1100-6517462/?ftag=C

<p>Breaking Bad is one of television's most popular TV shows, but series star Aaron Paul is not taking home residual checks from Netflix, where the show is streaming in the US. Appearing on the picket line outside Sony Pictures Studio recently, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/aaron-paul-bryan-cranston-breaking-bad-strike-sag-b2404851.html">The Independent reports</a> that Paul said streaming companies now need to "pony up."</p><p>"I don't get a piece from Netflix on Breaking Bad to be totally honest and that's insane to me," Paul, who plays Jesse Pinkman, said. "I think a lot of these streamers know that they have been getting away with not paying people a fair wage and now it's time to pony up."</p><p>Sony Pictures owns the rights to Breaking Bad and Netflix paid the company a fee--presumably a massive fee given the popularity of the show--to stream it in the US. The show originally aired on AMC and has seen multiple extensions of the universe. A pr
