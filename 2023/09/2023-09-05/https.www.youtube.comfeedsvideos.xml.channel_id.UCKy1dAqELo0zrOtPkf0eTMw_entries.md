One Piece reviewed by Kenneth Seward Jr.

Netflix’s One Piece strives to recreate the magic of its source material in live-action, but this requires jettisoning some pieces of the plot. This creates an interesting variation on the long-running manga and anime that works in parts, and the Netflix series is at its best when it charts its own path in response to the changes made by showrunner Matt Owens and the writing staff. Unfortunately, instead of committing fully to this retelling, One Piece constantly sails back into familiar waters and fan service, muddying the experience. It’s a shame considering most of the other aspects – from the visual and practical effects to wild action scenes and endearing cast – work well together. While this live-action version does an admirable job of showcasing the spirit of One Piece, its abridged treatment of the plot removes most, if not all of its heart.
