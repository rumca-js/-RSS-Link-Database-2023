<p>Spotify is experimenting with the offerings of its Premium service. Over the last few days, several Spotify users on the free tier noticed they no longer had access to in-app lyrics. Instead, they were greeted by a notification bubble saying, “Enjoy lyrics on Spotify Premium,” along with a link to sign up. Spotify says putting the in-app lyrics behind a paywall is just a part of its <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-live-lyrics-united-states-test-ios-android-140045159.html">routine testing</a>.</p><p>"At Spotify, we routinely conduct a number of tests, some of those tests end up paving the way for our broader user experience and others serve only as an important learning,”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Spotify's co-head of global communications, CJ Stanley, told <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/5/23860124/spotify-lyrics-premium-only-feature"><em>The Verge</em></a>. “We don’t have any further news to

<p>TikTok appears ready to move the platform closer to a full-fledged social network. As <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/09/05/tiktok-social-networking-messaging-features">spotted by</a><em>Axios</em>, the company has posted new job listings for positions focused on social networking features and expanded direct messaging. A “Product manager - TikTok social” posting <a href="https://careers.tiktok.com/position/7097101084908603661/detail">reads</a> that the company wants to build “meaningful social connections between users.”</p><p>The job listings are reportedly connected to worries within the organization about retaining and growing user engagement. “Inside TikTok, there’s concern that users are sharing TikTok videos externally on other social media and messaging apps when they want to discuss them with friends,” <em>Axios</em> reported, citing sources within the company.

<p>Accessories will be key whether you’re turning your new Apple iPad into a laptop replacement or just trying to protect it against daily-life hazards. It’s tempting to turn to Apple’s own accessories — and in some cases, you should — but there’s a slew of alternatives from other companies like Otterbox, Logitech and Anker, that work just as well and are often more affordable. We tested out a bunch of cases, keyboards, styli and other miscellany to determine which are the best iPad accessories to buy that will help you get the most out of your iPad, from the iPad Air to the iPad Mini or a different iPad model.</p><h2>O<strong>tterbox Symmetry 360 case</strong></h2><p></p><p>Otterbox is an expert when it comes to protection, as seen with their phone cases, but its <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLUR

<p>Respawn and EA are rolling out a significant patch for <em>Star Wars: Jedi Survivor</em>. The game, plagued with performance issues at launch, now supports a “solid 60 fps” in performance mode on consoles. In addition, the PC version (which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-wars-jedi-survivor-and-the-year-of-disappointing-pc-ports-141551209.html">bore the brunt</a> of many of the performance complaints) also received some stability improvements in patch seven.</p><p>The game’s <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/starwars/jedi/jedi-survivor/patch-notes">patch notes</a> say PS5 and Xbox Series X/S users can expect a “completely reworked” performance mode for a “substantially” improved experience.

The developers have also improved quality mode (which prioritizes graphical fidelity over a consistent frame rate) with “optimizations”
