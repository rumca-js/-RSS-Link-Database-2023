  <p id="B8yQZN">How do you tweak a classic hot hatch for the electric era? If you’re Volkswagen, you simply announce that the “I” in GTI now stands for “intelligence” instead of “injection” and call it a day. </p>
<p id="BRrow8">Just kidding. Obviously, VW went much further in unveiling the new GTI concept, or ID.GTI,  which had its official debut at IAA Mobility in Munich this weekend. The reinterpretation of the 1976 original GTI has a lot more state-of-the-art tech and an electrified powertrain. But moreover, it could signal the future of this particular form of quick-footed hatchback. </p>
