<p>The world of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> is full of horny people. Demons, devils, tieflings, satyrs, minotaurs, even dragonborn &mdash; there are people with horns all over the place. But, in <em>Baldur&rsquo;s Gate III</em>, a new video game based on the rules and setting of the decades-old tabletop game, players found themselves inundated with characters who are the <em>other </em>kind of horny. (As well as literally horny &mdash; there are lots of devils in this game!) According to developer Larian Studios, the unabashedly amorous NPCs are a launch bug, in the process of being corrected. </p>



<p>Now to be sure, the fact that there are fully nude sex scenes in<em> Baldur&rsquo;s Gate III</em> is part of its broader appeal. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://gizmodo.com/baldurs-gate-3-druid-bear-sex-scene-d-d-larian-

<p>Many PC construction manuals advise the use of an anti-static wrist strap before you start assembling the PC. And an anti-static wrist strap is inexpensive and easy to use. But is it really necessary? Let&rsquo;s explore.</p>



<p>The anti-static wristband exists for the same reason your hair stands up when you rub a balloon against it, or a sweater feels funny when it has just been removed from the clothes dryer&mdash;static electricity. Static electricity is harmless most of the time, but if you are electrically charged and touch something conductive, you pass that charge on.</p>



<p>If you touch metal, you pass the electricity to the metal. And if you touch bare electronics while you are charged, you transfer it to the electronics and cause an electrostatic discharge, or ESD.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The best charger is the one that shipped with your laptop&rdquo; is old advice that needs updating because there are often superior options available either as your principal laptop charger, as a spare, or as a flexible travel charger.</p>



<p>You know that the charger that came with your laptop will work, but it won&rsquo;t do much else and there are third-party USB-C chargers available that do much more.</p>



<p>Some laptops still ship with their own cumbersome AC power brick and barrel-shaped DC connector, but most premium laptops today also or solely charge via USB-C&mdash;including all the models in our roundup of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/436674/the-best-pc-laptops-of-the-year.html">the best laptops</a>.</p>
