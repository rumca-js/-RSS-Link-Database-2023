<p>Veteran Ireland captain’s demanding streak has not dimmed as he eyes final tilt at winning Rugby World Cup aged 38</p><p>Thirteen minutes to play in the final and St Mary’s College are up 7-6 against Belvedere. It’s the senior cup, and they have won it once in the last three decades of trying. Their fly-half, Joey Connolly, scored the only try in the seventh minute and they have been hanging on to the lead for almost an hour now, while the rain’s been coming down in sheets. Connolly is just off, and here’s his replacement, a skinny kid called Johnny Sexton, running a loop on the 22. Before the game, Sexton has bet the boys he’ll drop a goal, and now he’s dropping into the pocket, back, back, back, and the scrum-half has snapped the ball and Sexton’s swinging his boot and the ball’s up, up, up into the wind.</p><p>It finished 10-6, “Cool Sexton Grasps the Moment” was the headline in the next day’s Irish Times, and you can bet his family still has the clipping, 21 years on.</p> <a h

During Rubiales’ now infamous assembly speech, the president of the Spanish football federation (RFEF) offered the Spain manager a new four-year contract on €500,000 a year, not more and no less to prove a point. While 11 members of the coaching staff of the national team released a joint statement in support of Jennifer Hermoso, Vilda was not part of it.

<p>My author spouse never let me read anything he wrote before it was finished. But after his death from cancer, I found myself choosing funeral flowers at the same time as covers for his memoir, Word Monkey</p><p>It is strange to be married to an author. At least, it was to me. I inhabited a corporate world, whereas my husband Chris - professionally known as Christopher Fowler – wrote more than 50 novels, from thrillers and crime fiction to fantasy and horror. I was impressed when we started dating and I found out he wrote the immortal line for my favourite film, Alien: “In space no one can hear you scream.” It was not something with which he particularly liked to be associated and he did not trumpet it. He wanted people to remember what he considered to be his real work: his books.</p><p>The cancer diagnosis came as a shock. It also came the week before lockdown. It was a very strange period, and one I’m not going to talk about – Chris does that very beautifully in his book Word Mo

Loosely based on a <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/true-crime/hit-man-2/">longform true-crime article</a> by Skip Hollandsworth, it follows the fortunes of Gary Johnson, a fake contract killer for the New Orleans police department, setting up stings in cheap diners while the cops wait outside.

For those who remember their own journey, the nostalgia is difficult to suppress: the fear, the adrenaline, the strange single bed waiting at the end of a motorway. University was the next step on the road to independence after the preceding years of important firsts – late-night parties, kisses, exam results – and a chance to prove yourself away from home comforts. For this year’s cohort of students, it’s a different story. <br /><br />Because, let’s face it, they haven’t had it easy so far.

<p>Cathryne Czubek’s documentary about an impoverished film-maker and an American superfan veers towards a white saviour narrative but the low-budget movie mogul’s charisma wins out</p><p>Here is a documentary about a self-taught film-maker from impoverished edgetown Wakaliga, near Kampala in Uganda, and the American fan who comes to meet him and becomes a collaborator. At first it looks like a bouncy, bright feelgood story barely disguising a white-saviour narrative under the surface; after all, that is what both director Cathryne Czubek and former publicist (and now fan) Alan Hofmanis are. That said, Czubek makes a concerted effort to crosscut between the viewpoints of Hofmanis and the charismatic figure who draws him to Uganda from New York in the first place: uber-low-budget movie mogul Isaac Nabwana, whose story rightly dominates.</p><p>Although former brickmaker Nabwana made thousands of bricks by hand (he demonstrates his technique with mud and frames for the camera) to be abl

<p>Fly-half reveals much in his new book, not least the preference for pragmatists over visionaries that still holds England back</p><p>Danny Cipriani’s new autobiography<em> Who Am I?</em> has been causing a bit of a stir, even in a busy week for rugby. Suffice to say, if the former England fly-half had represented his country as successfully and frequently as he says he chatted up the nation’s women, his caps record would never be beaten.</p><p>The line that really hit the spot, however, had nothing to do with his – how to put this best – lively personal life. Forget the “squad” rotation details serialised in The Times and focus instead on Cipriani’s thoughts about why England were so reluctant to pick him. For years, he suggests, they have been keener to pick players who are the quickest to get back up off the floor after a ruck or a tackle, a traditional indicator of both desire and fitness. Cipriani sees it slightly differently. “I’m thinking, ‘Who gives a shit? Surely it’s more

## Climate politics is more complex and urgent than ever – is the IPCC still fit for purpose? | Adam Standring

<p>With solutions to the climate emergency desperately needed, political neutrality and consensus may no longer be an option</p><p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has achieved many successes. In its 35 years, the UN body has become the most authoritative global source of knowledge on climate breakdown. Politicians, policymakers and social movements from around the world draw on its reports and data to frame the problem of the climate emergency and to envisage solutions.</p><p>But as climate politics has become more complex, more diverse and more pressing, the IPCC is increasingly called upon to fulfil roles not envisaged at its creation – and to which it is not well suited.

<p>Robert Fico, the former PM who showers praise on Moscow and models himself on Victor Orbán, is leading the polls for the coming elections</p><p>Slovakia matters far more than Europe realises. On 30 September, the small European country holds a parliamentary election that will have ramifications far beyond its borders. If the opinion polls are correct, it would mark the return of Robert Fico: a man who lavishes praises on Moscow and models himself on Viktor Orbán, the “alt-right” leader in neighbouring Hungary. The European Union and Nato could soon have a new troublemaker within.</p><p>When Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, Slovakia went all in to defend Ukrainian sovereignty. Per capita, it has been one of Kyiv’s staunchest backers, becoming the first Nato country to send fighter jets. If Fico is elected, it is in danger of doing a 180-degree turn and giving its support to Vladimir Putin.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/sep/05/slovakia-elections

We mashed-up psychedelia and pop and punk and experimentalism. And we had each other to buoy us, so we didn’t need the rest of the world’s approval.”</p><p>Nevertheless, as chronicled by the excellent new documentary The Elephant 6 Recording Co, this fiercely independent, uncompromising community eventually won audiences across the world, siring a generational masterpiece along the way: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/oct/26/cult-heroes-neutral-milk-hotel-alt-rock-enigmas-who-shied-away-from-the-spotlight"
