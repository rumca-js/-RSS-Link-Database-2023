Happily, with Windows 95 through Windows 7, printer problems didn\u2019t register much on my radar. But in the wake of upgrading my network to Windows 10 a few years back, I noticed an uptick in printer problems. On the other hand, Windows 11 seems rock solid where printing comes into the picture.</p><p>If printing is a cause for concern with your Windows setup, you may be relieved to know that all problems I\u2019ve encountered have been easy to diagnose and fix, providing you know what steps to take to figure out what\u2019s up. I hope this how-to will help readers zip through detection and diagnosis and proceed more quickly to the usual cures for printing ills.</p><p class=\"jumpTag\"><a href=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/3012217/how-to-fix-printing-problems-windows-10-windows-11.html#jump\">To read this article ", "link": "https://www.computerworld.com/article/3012217/how-to-fix-printing-problems-windows-10-windows-11.html#tk.rss_all", "date_published": "2023-09-26T10:00:00+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "ComputerWorld", "album": "ComputerWorld", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2023/05/men-with-printing-press-c1935-seattle-municipal-archives-via-flickr-100941101-small.jpg"}]
