On September 13, Chinese media The Paper reported that since the start of primary and secondary schools in September, Shanghai Children's Specialized Hospital has seen a wave of traffic, and the number of patients with infectious fever in children has increased significantly. Similar conditions are found throughout the country. 
The so-called "mycoplasma pneumonia" is like the virus that was prevalent for three years and it’s mainly transmitted through droplets. Symptoms include fever, high fever that does not go away, white lungs, difficulty in breathing, lack of appetite, etc., but hospitals claim that it’s Mycoplasma pneumonia. 
The public questioned the authorities for changing the name to cover up the outbreak. The official media reported the outbreak in the first half of the year to be influenza A, but in the second half of the year, it became "mycoplasma pneumonia," despite the symptoms being the same as the COVID-19 virus.
