With over 80 million units sold in its lifetime, the PSP was obviously a popular choice for gamers which meant that a lot of popular home console franchises made their way to the handheld in some form or other. 

Between this and the many new IPs available on the console, there’s a vast breadth of games to keep players busy between train rides and short breaks. With this feature, we take a look back at the legacy of the PSP as we run down 15 of the best games on the system.

Turn 10 Studios' Forza Motorsport is one of the most celebrated in gaming, with each entry improving upon the last in terms of gameplay, graphics and realism. With its 2023 title, the developer has taken the reboot approach, distilling the series to its core while breaking new ground.

Whether you're into racing sims or not, there's no denying that Forza Motorsport is one of the biggest games of the year. Join us as we delve deeper into why before its release on October 10th for Xbox Series X/S and PC.

With the release of 2.0 and Cyberpunk 2077’s spy thriller expansion Phantom Liberty CD Projekt RED have finally completed their redemptive arc. The disastrous launch in 2020 is now a faded memory. It’s fair to say the free 2.0 update and modestly priced Phantom Liberty DLC have transformed Cyberpunk 2077 into the game it was always supposed to be. 

The success of these updates and additions can be attributed to the hands of the talented developers at CD Projekt RED too, for when all hope was lost following Cyberpunk 2077’s release, they steadied the ship and righted wrongs through their tireless work in the three years since, and the fruits of their labor are clear to see now. Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 and Phantom Liberty are triumphs.
