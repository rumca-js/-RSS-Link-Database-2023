"Light Speed" (1997) by JRB/Onyx (Jethro R. Brewin). Notes about the edit below.
Art "Self-portrait found in a bathtub" by Darklight/Ghostown, 1st at Riverwash 2015.

A percussion type instrument that gets introduced around 2:17 got to my nerves due to its volume (too loud, felt imbalanced in that regard). In this edit the volume of that instrument is adjusted down to make it more tolerable. You can still cleary hear it at all times it is used, it's just not that overpowering anymore. Later in the track it kind of gets replaced with another one, which did not have any problems with its volume.

Open Cubic Player 2.6.0pre6 and Gravis Ultrasound PnP clone hardware mixing (InterWave).
