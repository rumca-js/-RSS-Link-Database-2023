Blizzard veteran Chris Metzen - who retired from the studio back in 2016, only to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-years-after-his-retirement-blizzard-veteran-chris-metzen-is-returning-to-warcraft">rejoin at the end of last year</a> - has been made executive creative director of Warcraft.
</p><p>
Prior to his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-story-overlord-chris-metzen-retires-aged-42">departure in 2016</a>, Metzen, who had been with Blizzard for 23 years at that point, was head writer and lore guru at the company (more officially, senior vice president of story and franchise development) with a hand in all the studio's properties.
</p><p>
Since rejoining Blizzard, however, Metzen has been solely focused on Warcraft (in the role of franchise creative advisor), and his new executive creative director positio

Three years after making its PC debut as an Epic Games Store exclusive, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is coming to Steam, with its release date set for 3rd October.
</p><p>
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 - which originally launched for PS4, Xbox One, and Epic back in September 2020 - combines remakes of developer Neversoft's much-loved skating games into a single, critically acclaimed package. The end result was an experience that thoroughly reinvigorated the two-decade old classics, with Digital Foundry's John Linneman even going as far as to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2020-tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-activisions-game-of-the-generation">call Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2</a> "one of the best games of the generation".

The Talos Principle 2, Serious Sam studio Croteam's follow-up to its acclaimed 2014 first-person puzzle adventure, will launch for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC on 2nd November.
</p><p>
The original Talos Principle served up a wonderfully cerebral bout of puzzle-solving, set across a series of locations loosely inspired by classical civilisations, that played out something like Portal, albeit with a hell of a lot more lasers, a little bit of time manipulation, and a healthy dose of philosophical musing. Each open-ended location featured a number of discrete puzzle 'rooms' that required players to move and position various contraptions - laser emitters, jammers, fans, blocks, and so on - to open gates, retrieve special sigils, and progress.
</p><p>
As for The Talos Principle 2, it sounds like players can expect more of the 

## Don't Nod's Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden delayed to February next year

Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden, the supernatural action-RPG from Life is Strange studio Don't Nod, has been delayed to 13th February 2024 to avoid an "intense release cycle for AAA titles".
</p><p>
Banishers unfolds in the frozen North American wilderness, in the year 1695, where ghost hunters (and lovers) Antea Duarte and Red mac Rait are working to protect the living from the spectral dead. Their situation becomes somewhat more complicated when Antea suddenly finds herself unexpectedly dead and also a ghost.
</p><p>
Don't Nod and publisher Focus Entertainment had, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-studios-action-rpg-banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-gets-release-date">confirmed back in July</a>, originally intended to release Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden on 7th November, but, in a <a href="http

## Cyberpunk 2077's 2.0 update is so good you should consider restarting from scratch

There is nothing more consistently satisfying in an RPG than the feeling of unlocking a new skill. Grand story decisions are few and far between, but the RPG skill tree is always there with you, feeding you little power boosts, hinting at new ways you might be able to attack each encounter - if only you gained just a little more XP, and more cash for a key weapon or cybernetic upgrade.
</p><p>
With new perk trees and overhauled itemisation, the Cyberpunk 2.0 update warrants a total restart. Like almost all video game RPGs, Cyberpunk's progression systems are all about accruing power - the difficulty lies in discovering where the power lies in a mess of perks, abilities, attributes and gear bonuses. The 2.0 update takes an awkward, annoying tangle, breaks it apart, and reforms it into a more welcoming and satisfying form, li

## Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty - an ambitious evolution targeting today's consoles

Cyberpunk 2077 has come a long way. First released in December 2020, the open-world RPG was saddled with technical issues, including bugs and very poor frame-rates on last-gen console systems. Sony even pulled the game from sale amidst a wave of negative feedback from early players. Some three years later, most of those initial concerns have been resolved, and current-gen consoles and PCs are getting a major expansion, Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty - an impressive evolution of the core game.  
</p><p>
This expansion promises bold new gameplay features and a brand-new storyline, alongside a substantial new playable area to explore filled with side-content. It's a major piece of post-release content, and the game's only planned expansion. So how does this new release - crafted free of last-gen constraints - run on the current-

Resident Evil 4 Remake is heading to mobile, but it'll cost players &pound;57.99 to play in full.
</p><p>
The game's listing on the App Store has the game available for free but with in-app purchases. Scrolling down, those purchases are listed in full with "Resident Evil 4 (with bonus)" priced at &pound;57.99.
</p><p>
This is more expensive than as currently priced on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2050650/Resident_Evil_4/">Steam</a> (&pound;49.99) and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/resident-evil-4-remake/">PSN</a> (&pound;54.99), but similar to <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/resident-evil-4/9n7jcppcpn37">Xbox</a> (&pound;57.98).

Square Enix made the announcement in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sE3R0QdvVto">Japanese livestream</a> dedicated to the game.

Data will be shared between the mobile and Steam versions, but no further information has been announced yet. It's currently unclear when the Steam version will be released.

## El Paso, Elsewhere review - hectic monster blasting with killer style

El Paso, Elsewhere is beautifully simple. It's a third-person action game in which you fire guns and dive through windows, triggering bullet-time as you whittle down ranks of converging foes. Its levels are labyrinthine, its hunger for carnage is nearly endless. It's a thrilling challenge at the standard difficulty and thoroughly cathartic if you drop down the damage you receive, set the ammo to infinite, and just thrash away in the abyss. All of this, yes, but what's special about El Paso is how it's been dressed up.
</p><p>
It comes in layers. A noir hero in a trenchcoat enters a motel and rides the elevator down to hell, stopping at every level along the way. Twin pistols, blocky outlines, fizzing, flickering shadows: at first it feels like a Stranglehold PS1 demake. The character models have the odd silhouettes and triangle noses of

Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth producer Yoshinori Kitase and creative director Tetsuya Nomura have discussed the term JRPG, and shared contrasting opinions.

Nomura said he felt negatively towards the term, while Kitase was more accepting of its use to highlight the different approaches taken by Japanese game companies.

"I'm not too keen on it," Nomura told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/sep/21/the-makers-of-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">The Guardian</a> in a new interview. "Certainly, when we started doing interviews for the games that I started making, no one used that term - they just called them RPGs.

Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth will task players with catching chocobo in real-time out in the wild.
</p><p>
Of course, catching chocobo is nothing new for the series, but a new social post on X (formerly Twitter) from the game's official account shows how it'll work in Rebirth for the first time, with a video of Cloud catching one of the iconic yellow birds. 
</p><p>
The method actually looks similar to Breath of the Wild, with Cloud sneaking through foliage (and some conveniently spiky yellow flowers) and throwing out some greens as a distraction before mounting the bird.

For many, E3 is considered the magical place where the video games industry comes together, for a show jam-packed with exciting game announcements, demos and exclusive access to developers from all over the world. For me, however, the one event in the games industry calendar that has always held the most fascination is Tokyo Game Show. 
</p><p>
I grew up as a Sega kid, and was fascinated by the company's stream of console games coming out of Japan. I looked forward to TGS, as you could always expect the biggest announcements from the Tokyo-based company there (unlike the Kyoto-based Nintendo, which traditionally favoured E3, outside of rare exceptions such as Satoru Iwata's reveal of the Wii remote at TGS 2005).

A Nintendo Switch version of Red Dead Redemption 2 has shown up on the Brazilian ratings board's website.
</p><p>
As spotted by X (formerly Twitter) user <a href="https://twitter.com/necrolipe">necrolipe</a>, Red Dead Redemption 2 has been rated for Nintendo Switch in <a href="https://classindportal.mj.gov.br/consulta-jogos">Brazil</a>. Eurogamer has since verified this listing, which also details other platforms the game is currently available on.

Developer Rockstar is yet to announce a Switch edition of its Wild West prequel, and it is unclear when the Brazilian ratings board updated its site to include this version.
