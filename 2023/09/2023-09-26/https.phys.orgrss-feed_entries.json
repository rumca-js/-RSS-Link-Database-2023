From clipboard-and-pen observation to modern artificial intelligence-based techniques, tracking human and animal movement has come a long way. Current cutting-edge methods utilize artificial intelligence to automatically track parts of the body as they move. However, training these models is still time-intensive and limited by the need for researchers to manually mark each body part hundreds to thousands of times.", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2023-09-unleashing-power-ai-track-animal.html", "date_published": "2023-09-26T05:00:01+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "album": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "user": null, "language": "en-us", "thumbnail": "https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/tmb/2023/unleashing-the-power-o-1.jpg"}, {"source": "https://phys.org/rss-feed/", "title": "UK cost-of-living crisis set to increase early deaths: study", "description": "The UK's inflation-fueled cost-of-living crisis is set to \"cut lives short\" and \"significantly widen the wealth-health gap\", according to a study published by open access journal BMJ Public Health on Monday.", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2023-09-uk-cost-of-living-crisis-early-deaths.html", "date_published": "2023-09-26T04:23:47+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "album": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "user": null, "language": "en-us", "thumbnail": "https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/tmb/2019/householddust.jpg"}, {"source": "https://phys.org/rss-feed/", "title": "Antarctic sea ice hits lowest winter maximum on record: US data", "description": "The sea ice around Antarctica likely had a record low surface area when it was at its maximum size this winter, a preliminary US analysis of satellite data showed Monday.", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2023-09-antarctic-sea-ice-lowest-winter.html", "date_published": "2023-09-26T04:19:42+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "album": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "user": null, "language": "en-us", "thumbnail": "https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/tmb/2023/at-its-largest-point-t.jpg"}, {"source": "https://phys.org/rss-feed/", "title": "Rich nations, China must accelerate race to net zero: IEA", "description": "Rich and developing nations alike must sharply improve their net-zero targets, the International Energy Agency said Tuesday, warning that a clean energy surge was the main reason the world's climate goals are still within reach.", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2023-09-rich-nations-china-net-iea.html", "date_published": "2023-09-26T04:17:37+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "album": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "user": null, "language": "en-us", "thumbnail": "https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/tmb/2023/the-energy-sector-is-t.jpg"}, {"source": "https://phys.org/rss-feed/", "title": "Assessing the safety and suitability of using cat-attracting plants for olfactory enrichment", "description": "In a study published in iScience, a research team first examined the effects of silver vine on cats by comparing single exposure and long-term exposure to plant extracts.
