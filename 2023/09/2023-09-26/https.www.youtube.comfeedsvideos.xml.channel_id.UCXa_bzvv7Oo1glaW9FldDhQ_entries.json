With this feature, we take a look back at the legacy of the PSP as we run down 15 of the best games on the system.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcZnOk3-Rno", "date_published": "2023-09-26T21:30:03+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/YcZnOk3-Rno/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Why Forza Motorsport Will Be One of the Biggest Games of the Year", "description": "Turn 10 Studios' Forza Motorsport is one of the most celebrated in gaming, with each entry improving upon the last in terms of gameplay, graphics and realism. With its 2023 title, the developer has taken the reboot approach, distilling the series to its core while breaking new ground.\n\nIt's not an approach that every developer would take with their franchise, but Forza Motorsport revamps its physics, handling, damage model, weather and much more to evolve further. There's also the overhauled multiplayer, brand-new campaign, new locations, etc.\n\nWhether you're into racing sims or not, there's no denying that Forza Motorsport is one of the biggest games of the year.

The disastrous launch in 2020 is now a faded memory. It\u2019s fair to say the free 2.0 update and modestly priced Phantom Liberty DLC have transformed Cyberpunk 2077 into the game it was always supposed to be. \n\nThe success of these updates and additions can be attributed to the hands of the talented developers at CD Projekt RED too, for when all hope was lost following Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s release, they steadied the ship and righted wrongs through their tireless work in the three years since, and the fruits of their labor are clear to see now. Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 and Phantom Liberty are triumphs.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwTtrehBMCg", "date_published": "2023-09-26T16:45:02+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/gwTtrehBMCg/hqdefault.jpg"}]
