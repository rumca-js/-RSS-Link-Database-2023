<p>The politician’s robotic appearance on Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins sees him punched and abused – while reciting the same old excuses. Why is he doing this again? How do we stop it?</p><p>I regret to inform you that Matt Hancock is at it again. Almost a year since he gulped down a glass of liquidised meal worms on I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here!, and just weeks after using TikTok <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@matthancock/video/7264276841664449825">to out himself as the least competent lip-syncer alive</a>, he has chosen to continue his grimly endless redemption tour by appearing on one of television’s most grimly endless shows – Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins.</p><p>Judging by the first episode, it is business as usual. He is taken to the rain-soaked Vietnamese jungle and pushed into a lake. He walks a tightrope. He gets punched in the face by a retired footballer. Someone yells at him for running “like a fucking ostrich”. He takes it all on the chin with no real emotion,

<p>With just over 83 minutes on the clock, the Big Bank terrace was a motion picture. Supporters piled to the front of the stand to mob Demetri Mitchell after the winger, who was sent off five minutes later after picking up a second yellow card, blasted third-tier Exeter City into the Carabao Cup fourth round, dumping out Luton Town of the Premier League. Will Aimson and Pierce Sweeney glanced at each other on halfway and then elected to join a party that, frankly, was only just getting started. At least Luton’s team coach, parked on St James Road, directly behind the away terrace, was primed for a quick getaway.</p><p>For Luton, a trip to Devon provided a reminder of just how far they have come in the past six years. On their last visit here, in October 2017, Luton won 4-1 to climb to the top of League Two, months before going on to clinch promotion and continue their incredible ascent through the divisions.

<p>Most of the squad have taken the opportunity to disperse across France with pool leaders not in action this weekend</p><p>When the England squad reconvenes to get back into their World Cup groove on Thursday, Jonny May could find himself in hot water. By his own admission, the very fact he has disclosed how Joe Marler is in charge of a fines system, where punishments include having to wear a suit for a day, or doing a run to the patisserie, is likely to leave him at the mercy of the dice, which ultimately determine what sanction players face.</p><p>It is a stay of execution for May, though, because most of the squad have taken the opportunity to disperse to all corners of France – they have been instructed not to return to the UK – after Steve Borthwick gave his players a few days off. The bye week is a quirk of this tournament – and it means that should England reach the final week of the World Cup they will have been away from home for nearly nine weeks – so understandably, the

Bake Off is back, bringing with it the best of British summertime in a bunting-lined tent.</p><p>To be fully transparent, I am obsessed with baking. My sourdough starter has a name (Kenneth) and every children’s birthday cake I have baked could sit in the Louvre. To further complicate my relationship with the TV series, I spent a year at Prue Leith’s culinary school and failed my final exam because of my inability to make a puff pastry that would rise in 37-degree heat and over-salting a chicken ballotine. So, for me to come to every series and be charmed rather than triggered by the Bake Off challenges is a triumph for both my personal growth (37 degrees! Impossible!) and

Architect impressed by urban squatter settlements in Peru who then set about persuading the wider world of their value<p>In the 1950s and 60s John Turner, who has died aged 96, addressed the housing challenges faced by members of rural communities in Peru when they migrated to urban areas in search of a better life. Official planning and design approaches were neither appropriate nor affordable to such people, and Turner was immensely impressed by their resourcefulness in creating their own housing developments and even complete neighbourhoods. Turner’s writings, as John FC Turner, presented Peru’s urban squatter settlements – <em>barriadas </em>– to a global audience as not a problem but a resource.</p><p>Predominantly poor people moved on to land on the urban periphery, subdivided it into residential plots and places for community facilities, and built their own housing using whatever materials came to hand.

Actor who found fame playing Illya Kuryakin  in the 1960s television series The Man from UNCLE<p>In the 1960s, there was one actor who could justifiably claim that ladies prefer blonds. As the secret agent Illya Kuryakin in the TV series The Man from UNCLE, David McCallum, who has died aged 90, received more fan mail from young women than any other actor in MGM’s history.</p><p>With his Beatles-style haircut, his liking for black turtleneck sweaters (which created a fad among viewers nationwide), and an aloof and enigmatic air, through which he sneaked a fair amount of charm and self-amusement, McCallum made Kuryakin into a sex symbol of the period.

In Venezuela, William Álvarez, who lives in Chichiriviche de la Costa bay on the Caribbean country’s central coast, has made it his business to see off the threat. Each day, he removes them from the water one by one. He is also encouraging tourists and others in the fishing community to catch and eat the lionfish in an effort to control its voracious expansion.

<p>Cage plays a former hitman forced to come out of retirement in this mostly fun action comedy drama with a really stupid plot</p><p>Nicolas Cage looks for all the world like a man drawing his pension early and letting it all hang out. Here he is on the beach wearing a Hawaiian shirt, warm beer in hand, with scraggly shoulder length hair (squint and you might mistake him for The Dude in The Big Lebowski). But no, this guy is a cold-hearted killer, battering out the brains of a mob goon with a dumbbell as if he is swatting a fly. “The grandpa! He keeps killing everybody!” the goon’s colleague complains in a caveman growl.</p><p>The funny thing is, in his performance as a former government hitman, Cage dials it down nicely, keeping his freaky at a gentle 6 out 10. The film cruises along on his charm; it’s otherwise a totally disposable but mostly entertaining action comedy drama with a really stupid plot and a few good laughs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/sep/26/

I showed a photograph of it to my mum and she said: “Wow, it wasn’t even new when I bought it.” And she bought it in the 1950s.

This is a video game that built a dynasty out of jellified gore, cartoonishly proportioned femme fatales, and payloads of callow, South Park-ian bathroom humour. One of the core protagonists – a Van Damme knockoff named Johnny Cage – possesses a signature move where he drops into splits and delivers a debilitating nut-punch. (The unlucky victim quivers in weak-kneed agony for half a beat, opening them up to a devastating combo.) Another character, the rotund drunken master Bo’ Rai Cho, has an offensive moveset that is completely structured around his ability to projectile vomit with startling accuracy, causing his enemies to slip and fall in the muck.</p><p>And yet, despite the vaudevilli

Both locals and tourists are incensed</p><p>It’s a lovely September Monday morning in Ryde, on the Isle of Wight. Schools have gone back, the summer language students have left, most of the DFLs (down from Londons, the second-home weekenders) have returned to the city. Soon the restless house martins will be off, too. The island is slipping gently into quiet mode.</p><p>But the ticket office at Ryde Esplanade railway station is busy. Two women with a little black dog are talking to the man at the counter; another woman waits in line. Throughout the morning, there is a steady stream of customers, sometimes forming a queue at the ticket office. That is the shiny, new ticket office, opened this year as part of <a href="https://www.islandecho.co.uk/end-of-the-line-ryde-and-shanklin-ticket-offices-to-close-under-national-plans/">a £10m upgrade</a> to the

<p>This documentary about the presenter’s unexplained murder only highlights the lack of evidence. No wonder her brother approved its making – people must come forward for it to be solved</p><p>There is no specific reason for the arrival of the three-part Netflix series Who Killed Jill Dando? It marks no anniversary. There is no new information to be shared, no new suspect in the frame. But perhaps that is the point. One of the most unexpected and inexplicable high-profile murders in living memory remains unsolved. It has been made with the approval of Jill’s brother, Nigel, who says he hopes it will encourage someone to come forward or shake loose some vital piece of evidence that will lead to the discovery of her killer.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/jilldando">Jill Dando</a> was a television journalist and presenter who, on 26 April 1999, was shot in the head at point blank range at her front door in Fulham, west London, by an assailant who has never been identifie

The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has decided that the route to electoral success lies in “tough choices”, and is even now searching for a campaign anthem along the lines of “things can only get worse”. Having already abandoned the government’s own environmental promises, he’s talking about further cuts to the HS2 rail project, whose eastern arm to Nottingham <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/nov/18/hs2-rail-leg-to-leeds-scrapped-grant-shapps-confirms">and Leeds</a> he already amputated as chancellor.</p><p>HS2 will still run between London and Birmingham, for the very good reason they’ve already built that bit.

<p>A homeless man journeys from Cambridge to the coast in the Leicester writer’s fresh, funny and serious verse narrative</p><p><em>Enter the Water</em> tempts you to wade straight in. And it will take only the briefest of dips, a toe in the water, before you find yourself needing to read on. Whether or not this is poetry (and possibly it isn’t) swiftly becomes a non-issue, because Jack Wiltshire, who grew up in Leicester and recently graduated from Cambridge, occupies his own element. He is a Pied Piper of a writer (though I am not sure if the Pied Piper ever swam). His writing is fresh, funny and serious. His verse narrative, set in 2022, describes becoming homeless in Cambridge and journeying to the coast in the company of pigeons, a blackbird and the unruly Storm Eunice. Swimming, he finds, is a form of salvation. The book is an experiment, a work-in-progress, but not in the sense of requiring further effort; more because Wiltshire recognises life as an ongoing, scattered experim

Altogether, it’s a heady mix of potted history, period detail, violence, gangster lore, lust and lawlessness on which writer-director Philip Yung (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Call_(2015_film)">Port of Call</a>) really goes to town, splashing budget money like petrol all over the place and then throwing a lighted match on top just to see the pretty flames.

<p>A mission to steal a bag full of crystal meth sparks an enjoyable labyrinthine sci-fi adventure for two bickering addicts</p><p>Denise (Freya Tingley) and Johnny (Charles Grounds) are drug buddies living in present-day Melbourne. When they’re not getting high, they spend their time mooching about, bickering, and arguing about whether some of the fancier words Johnny uses are real. (Funnily enough, most of the time they are.) They are what the cops might uncharitably describe as no-hopers.</p><p>In what turns out to be a labyrinthine time-travelling plot, one day, the dirty duo’s regular drug dealer, Kane (Joshua Morton), sends them on a mission to a dilapidated house to steal a bag full of crystal meth, a chore that will clear their debt to him. Kane warns them not to try the supply, but of course garrulous Johnny does and within seconds he evaporates with a snap and whoosh of wind right before Denise’s face. In an edit, he finds himself in the same house but 25 years or so in the

Ten years on, he explains why he loves the sea more than ever – and decided to become a diver</p><p>Harrison Okene was sitting on the toilet – surely the worst place to be as disaster strikes – when a freak wave hit the tugboat he was working on, and turned it upside down. Now he was on the floor, and the toilet was above him.</p><p>“I was trying to open the door to get out, when the toilet fell and hit me on the head,” he says. He just had time to see blood pour from the wound before the lights went off. “Everywhere was dark.” The bathroom began to fill with water. “It didn’t take long,” he says. “One minute, two minutes” – and he felt the boat touch the seabed.

Now he has to win the argument all over again</p><p>This summer, when I visited him in his office in Berlin, the most powerful green politician in the world was at a low point. It was the last day of the parliamentary term and Robert Habeck, Germany’s vice-chancellor, was running half an hour late. When he finally arrived, he pretend-collapsed as he entered the room, dragging his satchel behind him like a frustrated teenager. When I asked how his day had been, he exhaled theatrically and quoted the opening line of the Boomtown Rats song I Don’t Like Mondays: “The silicon chip inside her head gets switched to overload.”</p><p>Habeck leads Germany’s Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, and earlier that afternoon one of his core pieces of legislation had been due to be passed by parliament.
