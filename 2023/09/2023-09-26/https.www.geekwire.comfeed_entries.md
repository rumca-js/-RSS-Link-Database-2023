Harrell released his 2024 budget proposal Tuesday that includes mid-biennium adjustments to the 2023-24 budget passed last year. The City uses two-year budget cycles and in odd years, such as 2023, it makes minor changes. Among Harrell&#8217;s proposals include a $1.8 million investment to fund testing of new &#8220;advanced safety technologies.&#8221; From the city&#8217;s budget adjustments summary: &#8220;With record-low numbers of police officers in 2023, the City must use technological support to boost the effectiveness of public safety strategies.

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="357" src="https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/nessie.png" width="650" /><br />The Federal Trade Commission&#8217;s antitrust lawsuit against Amazon alleges, for the first time publicly, that the company used a secret pricing algorithm known internally as &#8220;Project Nessie&#8221; to compete unfairly in the e-commerce market. Descriptions of the algorithm are blacked out extensively in the public version of the complaint, filed Tuesday morning in U.S. District Court in Seattle. An FTC spokesperson told GeekWire that the agency could not provide further details but raised the possibility of portions of the complaint being unredacted in the future. &#8220;There is no valid and cognizable justification for Amazon’s use of Project Nessie,&#8221; the complaint&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/ftc-targets-alleged-secret-amazon-pricing-algorithm-project-nessie-in-antitrust-complaint/">Read More</

The complaint alleges that Amazon uses &#8220;anticompetitive and unfair strategies&#8221; that &#8220;stop rivals and sellers from lowering prices, degrade quality for shoppers, overcharge sellers, stifle innovation, and prevent rivals from fairly competing&#8221; against the e-commerce giant. The long-awaited lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, is a test for FTC Chair Lina Khan and those who have targeted Amazon for years over its business practices. “Our complaint&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/ftc-and-17-states-sue-amazon-for-maintaining-alleged-monopoly-power-that-st

The Bellingham, Wash.-based business turns waste crab shells into a versatile, biodegradable polymer called chitosan (pronounced “kite-osan”) that can be used for wide-ranging industrial purposes. That includes water purification, replacing flame retardants and PFAS &#8220;forever chemicals&#8221; in clothing, and improving the uptake of fertilizers by plants. Launched in 2015 by a former Alaska fisherman, Tidal Vision has landed $30 million in investments to date and employs 80 people. &#8220;Our mission is to try to&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/this-startup-turns-discarded-crab-shells-into-useful-industrial-chemicals/">Read More</a>

Neugebauer said she&#8217;s worked with Zulily for a few years and never had problems getting paid until now.
