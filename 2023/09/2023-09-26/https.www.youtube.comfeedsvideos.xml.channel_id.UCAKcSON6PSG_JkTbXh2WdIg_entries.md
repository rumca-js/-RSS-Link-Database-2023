Singer-songwriter and novelist Josh Ritter visited Minneapolis on August 15 to play a Microshow at the Minneapolis Club. The neo-Tudor surroundings of the downtown Minneapolis spot proved a warm and welcoming space for a set of acoustic songs Ritter drew from three of his albums, as well as one unreleased song that’s a vital part of his 2021 novel, "The Great Glorious Goddamn of It All."

The audience consisted of lucky winners who had entered for a chance to attend this unique performance.
