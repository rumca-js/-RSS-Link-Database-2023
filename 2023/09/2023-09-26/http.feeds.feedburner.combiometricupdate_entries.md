		As of September 8th, 2023, roughly 81 million Filipinos have registered for national IDs in the past three years, but only 39.1 million IDs have actually been delivered, according to <a href="http://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2023/9/25/national-id-printed-sept-2024.html">CNN Philippines reporting</a>. Those who have yet to receive their physical IDs must rely on print-outs with their digital ID numbers.

National IDs are currently the main requirement for <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202309/sim-registration-system-in-philippines-accepts-digital-ids-with-animal-faces">SIM card registration</a>, but Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the country's central bank and ID card supplier, can only print 80,000 ID cards per day.

		Biometric payment systems – and privacy concerns surrounding those systems – are on the rise. Biometric payments could provide frictionless checkout and facilitate more sales, companies claim. Consumers are divided on the implementation of such a system – with some taking Amazon to court.
<h2>Biometric identification for payments, loyalty programs</h2>
Ecommerce platform provider <a href="https://corporate.freedompay.com/">FreedomPay</a> has announced that customers can now use Amazon's One palm biometric system as a method of payment. Amazon One hardware creates a palm template and stores the data on a "custom-built" cloud rather than the device.

		Australian job seekers could soon be able to store and share verified job skills and qualifications with employers through a newly announced National Digital Skills Passport. This passport would function as a digital ID for job qualifications. It is yet another step in Australia’s push to digitally transform the nation and provide better data access and security for its citizens and industries.

Jim Chalmers, treasurer; Jason Clare, minister for education; and Brendan O’Connor MP, minister for skills and training, <a href="https://ministers.education.gov.au/chalmers/national-skills-passport">confirmed</a> the government’s plans to spend $9.1 million Australian (roughly US$5.8 million) to support a business case for creating the digital skills passp

		The Executive Secretary of Ghana’s National Identification Authority (NIA), Prof Kenneth Agyemang Attafuah, has insisted that the government owes the ID-issuing agency outstanding arrears of almost $80 million for the production of ID cards.

The debt owed by the government is part of the reason why over three million Ghana Cards were withheld early this year by some partners of the NIA, according to a recent <a href="https://www.myjoyonline.com/government-still-owes-us-national-identification-authority/">audio report</a> by MyJoyOnline.

The NIA only took an order for part payment by Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Attah for the cards to be released for distribution, the publication reveals.

It is believed that the government debt has negatively affected the production of the ID card,

		A federal suit in the U.S. has been filed by a Black man who says he was falsely accused of credit-card fraud using a police facial recognition algorithm. Damages have not been made public.

<a href="https://news.yahoo.com/facial-recognition-technology-jailed-man-040422295.html">According to</a> the Associated Press, Randal Quran Reid was taken from his car after being arrested along an interstate in his home state of Georgia.

		The U.S. Homeland Security Department has agreed with four biometrics-related recommendations made by an inspector general. The inspector general's advice is to centralize and update how DHS uses biometrics and plans for new development.

However, there is a difference between agreeing with <a href="https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2023-09/OIG-23-58-Sep23.pdf">the recommendations</a> and implementing them, especially when some of the points made by the IG are not new.

		Authorities of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) say the use of biometrics has proved to be a reliable way through which thousands of forcibly displaced South Sudanese as well as refugees from neighbouring Sudan are identified for humanitarian assistance programs in the war-torn country.

In an IOM <a href="https://storyteller.iom.int/stories/positioning-innovative-data-solutions-core-effective-humanitarian-response-south-sudan">blog article</a> authored by a staff person working in the South Sudan, the continuing insecurity and natural disasters such as floods there, plus the fighting in neighbouring Sudan have led to an uptick in the number of displaced persons who require social welfare support in displacements camps across the country.

		Moody’s has faced a strong retort from the Indian government after the American credit ratings, research and data organization sharply criticized the Aadhaar biometric digital ID system in a recent report claiming it faces many shortcomings.

In the report titled “<a href="https://www.moodys.com/research/Decentralized-Finance-and-Digital-Assets-Cross-Region-Decentralized-digital-identity-Sector-In-Depth--PBC_1370639?cid=13FBCB2D58A17750">Decentralized Finance and Digital Assets</a>,” Moody’s claims that the Aadhaar biometrics system has proved unreliable in hot and humid climatic conditions especially for manual laborer's, and that the centralized data management system leaves users with no control over their data which is at high risk of criminal breaches.
