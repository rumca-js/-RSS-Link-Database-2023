<p>Death and taxes may be the most famous of life&rsquo;s certainties, but you can also always count on Google to kill off another service or feature. It&rsquo;s often something fiercely beloved or downright useful, too. (No, I&rsquo;m still not over losing Google Reader.) And unfortunately, the Grim Reaper has appeared once again. This time the scythe is coming for one of the company&rsquo;s oldest features&mdash;Gmail&rsquo;s basic HTML view. In January 2024, that simple interface heads for the great beyond.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/25/23889791/gmail-basic-html-view-discontinued-2024&amp;xcust=2-1-2082863-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">The Verge</a>, the impending death was announced quietly in a Google help page around mid-September.&

<p>It seems like VR gaming has been in kind of a holding pattern for the last year or two, ever since <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em> came out. I suspect that, with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1938809/the-meta-quest-3-is-thinner-faster-and-pricier-at-500.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Facebook/Meta pushing hard</a> to get AR into the hands of more regular consumers, and the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1942688/apples-vision-pro-rips-off-the-hololens-seven-years-later.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">looming threat of Apple&rsquo;s Vision Pro</a> next year, a lot of companies are using this time to shore up their core products.

<p>AI will change the way that we work. Or so says the most fervent purveyors of the tech, which now includes Microsoft. But after seeing ChatGPT, Dall-E, and other AI systems integrated into the latest versions of Windows 11, Office, and the company&rsquo;s Microsoft 365 platform, I can&rsquo;t say that I agree.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Make no mistake, Microsoft is <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2071752/windows-11-23h2-update-sept-26-copilot-rar-support-more.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">pushing new tools like its Copilot system hard</a>, integrating it into systems that are staples for the company and hundreds of millions of users. But speaking as a power user &mdash; and accepting the limited perspective that gives me for many who are not&nbsp; &mdash; I can&rsquo;t see these new tools being anything more than an occasional curiosity.&nbsp;</

<p>Windows users will soon have a way of sampling new games without downloading them, a new feature called &ldquo;Instant Games&rdquo; that will be introduced as part of the upcoming Windows 11 update.</p>



<p>The new feature is rolling out in preview, apparently as part of a Microsoft Store update that will coincide with the Windows 23H2 release rolling out over the next few weeks.</p>



<p>The new Instant Games appears to work similarly to a feature already in Android: Instant Play, part of a feature called Google Play Instant. In both Android and Windows, the &ldquo;Instant&rdquo; portion means that selecting a new supported game to play will bypass the typical download and install process for immediate gratification. Not surprisingly, the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://developer.android.com/topic/google-play-instant/

<p>Microsoft Paint is gaining generative AI powers with Paint Cocreator, a new feature debuting in conjunction that will eventually arrive in Windows 11 23H2, now known as the Windows 11 2023 Update. </p>



<p>It&rsquo;s a big win for Paint, which was <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407133/microsoft-will-save-microsoft-paint-making-it-a-downloadable-app.html">on its deathbed as late as 2017</a>.

<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s next Windows 11 feature update won&rsquo;t roll out overnight. In fact, several pieces will take some time to deliver &mdash; including the launch of the highly anticipated Windows Copilot feature.</p>



<p>Today, you can begin downloading some of the future <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2071752/windows-11-23h2-update-sept-26-copilot-rar-support-more.html">features of Windows 11</a> as part of the new update.  But there&rsquo;s still an unexpected twist: The new Windows 11 features we thought were scheduled for Windows 11 23H2 are part of a new update to Windows 11 22H2 instead. There is in fact a separate Windows 11 23H2 update, due sometime in the fourth quarter, which will be known as the Windows 11 2023 Update.</p>



<p>&ldquo;These experiences, including Copilot in Windows and more, will start to become available on Sept. 26 a

<p>Buying and selling used PC parts is a time-honored tradition, but it&rsquo;s rare for a big-box retailer to get in on the action. Newegg is trying just that, offering a trade-in program for graphics cards that will give you credit towards the purchase of a new one. It&rsquo;s more or less the same model as phone trade-in&rsquo;s&hellip;along with the lack of an option for a cash payout. </p>



<p>In fact, even the mechanism will be familiar to anyone who&rsquo;s traded in their existing phone to a manufacturer or carrier before. When you buy a new GPU on Newegg, you&rsquo;ll be given the option to apply to swap in your existing card and deduct the estimated value from the purchase. You&rsquo;ll see a Preliminary Offer based on precisely what card you have &mdash; not all GPUs will be eligible, of course &mdash; and if you accept, you&rsquo;ll get a pre-paid shi

<p>Does the world need laptops with gigantic screens that fold in half? The jury is still out. But in the meantime, manufacturers are still throwing designs at the wall to see what sticks. <em>[Editor&rsquo;s note: Do not throw your laptop at the wall. It will not stick.]</em> The LG Gram Fold packs a 17-inch folding OLED screen and the now-familiar detachable keyboard and rear stand. It&rsquo;ll be coming to South Korea next month with an international release yet to be determined. </p>

<p>The Netgear support document in question is about Wi-Fi over the 6 GHz band. This was introduced with the Wi-Fi 6E standard and is also mandatory for Wi-Fi 7. According to Netgear, in order to use the 6 GHz band, a PC must have a compatible network adapter with the latest drivers and also use the latest version of Windows 11.</p>



<p>In this context, Netgear stresses that Microsoft has indicated that it will not backport 6 GHz support to Windows 10. S

<p>Today, Acer announced the new Nitro V line of gaming laptops, some of which are priced as low as $700. These laptops feature powerful hardware, a high refresh rate display, immersive audio, and impressive cooling. While the manufacturer definitely checks off all of the necessary boxes as far as gaming laptops go, the one thing that snags my attention is the price of the RTX 2000 configurations, specifically. You just don&rsquo;t see many sub-$1,000 machines and I love the idea of making gaming laptops more accessible. Not everyone can afford a $4,000 rig, you know?</p>
