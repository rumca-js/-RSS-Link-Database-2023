I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of Melbourne, Australia 1931, starts with a panoramic view from the Morehouse Tower of St. Paul's Cathedral, looking south over the Yarra River towards the Botanic Gardens and War Memorial. This is followed by a tracking shot from one of the tree-lined shoulder lanes of St Kilda Road, then views of Princes Bridge, Collins Street buildings, City Hall, Parliament House and the Royal Exhibition building in Carlton Gardens. 

Video Restoration Process:
✔ FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
✔ Image resolution boosted up to HD 
✔ Improved video sharpness and brightness 
✔ Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
✔added sound only for the ambiance
✔restoration:(denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
