One of my main goals in turning forty this year has been to get in the best physical shape of my life and I was invited to join a few of my friends on a long distance bike ride cycling across 2 counties France and Belgium to complete an almost 120mile ride in one day!

Thanks to Evan's Cycles for hooking me up with a bike https://www.evanscycles.com/
