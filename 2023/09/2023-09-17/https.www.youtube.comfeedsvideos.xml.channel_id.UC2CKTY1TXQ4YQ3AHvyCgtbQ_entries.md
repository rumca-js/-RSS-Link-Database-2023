I'm back from NOVA Open and from the Alliance Distributors Open House trade show - and I'm very glad to be home. All kinds of interesting things happened while I was traveling, both to me and to the world of wargaming! We'll talk about that and of course, I'll also answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!

Vince Venturella and I made another game! Check out MAJESTIC 13 at http://www.majestic13game.com

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
