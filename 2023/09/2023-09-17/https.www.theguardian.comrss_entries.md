<p>After the euphoria of the win over Argentina, this was a reminder of how far Steve Borthwick’s side have to go</p><p>“The entire effort of the future will be to invent silence, slowness and solitude,” the French surrealist painter Marcel Duchamp once said. Alas, Duchamp died in 1968 and was unable to witness Steve Borthwick’s England rendering his vision in perfect flesh. At the end of a game that seemed to last for about four months, it was England who were left still standing, still unbeaten, still playing the sort of rugby not even its mother could love.</p><p>At least it all ended in a minor blaze of fun. As England put a little butter and marmalade on the scoreline in the final 15 minutes, as Marcus Smith made his belated entrance and began to run riot against a tiring Japan team who had finally discovered their outer limits, it was possible to see how England would ultimately rationalise this performance in their own minds.

Arsenal have, in order: stumbled to underwhelming one-goal wins over Forest and Palace, dropped points by yielding an equaliser to 10-man Fulham, and waited until stoppage time to finally get the winning goal against Manchester United (which may be the most shameful performance of all, come to think of it). The Arsenal I see so far this year is a clear level below the one that looked like the class of the division for three-fourths of last season.”<

## Epigenetics and evolution: ‘the significant biological puzzle’ of sexual orientation

<p>The ‘gay gene’ some touted as explaining widespread homosexuality in humans has not been found. Might epigenetics hold the answer?</p><p>Last century, when things were a whole lot worse for gay people than they are today, there was a widely held notion that human homosexual behaviour was a choice, and that a homosexual person could change their ways and become heterosexual. For this reason, the occasional report of a ‘gay’ gene was welcomed by many progressive people. The existence of such genes would show that homosexuality was not a choice but an inevitable consequence of development and genetics. Indeed, gay genes were perhaps the only example where many left-leaning people heartily embraced genetic determinism.</p><p>Awkwardly, like cold fusion, reports of genes that ‘cause’ human homosexuality (and many other human behaviours) have failed to stand up to scrutiny – there is no ‘gay gene’ in the sense that no one has identified genetic markers or genes that reliably predict sex

<p>After years spent dismissing progressive concerns, Tories want to highlight national decline, but to accept no responsibility </p><p>Girl Who Boys Can’t Hear was a recurring character who featured on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE3r_CgScms">The Fast Show</a>. She is a woman in the company of men who raises an intelligent solution to a problem, or makes an insightful observation, only to be ignored entirely. A few seconds after she has spoken, a man says something to the effect of “Oh I’ve got it!”, and repeats what she has said verbatim. The group of men immediately spring to agreement and admiration of his input. The woman then says: “Sorry, can any of you actually <em>hear</em> me?”</p><p>The sketch always raised a laugh even though you knew what was coming. What elevated it every time wasn’t the punchline, but the elaborate performance of the men – earnestly scratching their heads at the problem, studiously pretending to come up with an answer after the truth-telli

Director who examined life in multicultural Britain in pioneering films such as Pressure, a defining work of black British cinema<p>Horace Ové, who has died aged 86, was the groundbreaking director of Pressure, the first full-length black British feature film, in 1975. Its release was delayed for several years by its backers at the British Film Institute, who feared that the scenes of police brutality might prove incendiary.</p><p>The picture charts with patience and fastidiousness the gradual political awakening of Anthony (Herbert Norville), an amiable African-Caribbean school-leaver. Living in west London with his traditionalist parents, he is torn between his white former classmates, who are getting on in a job market that is openly hostile to him, and his militant older brother, who castigates him for failing to adopt the black struggle as his own. It was a conflict that Ové, who arrived in Britain from Trinidad in 1960, knew only too well. “I’ve lived in two worlds ever since I

The sport helped with my tenacity, and my creativity too<p>In my Chinese family, many of my older relatives are astonished when they learn I enjoy long-distance running. First, they assume “long distance” implies one or two miles. Then, when I tell them it’s actually 26.2, they stare at me as if I’ve forgotten how to count. The more traditional ones say something along the lines of, “Girls shouldn’t run so much.”</p><p>Over time, however, their complaints have lessened. In recent years, running has grown more mainstream in China, especially among the post-1980s generation. With the rise of the middle class and the influence of globalisation, running clubs have become more popular, as have recreational races. While for women, pale, youthful and slender remains the gold standard for beauty in China, there is also a divergent push for more expansive definitions – one that takes into account physical and mental wellbeing, rather than just thinness. For many of my runner friends, long-dis

On Thursday and Friday, the 90-minute special episode of Channel 4’s investigative documentary strand, Dispatches, which was to air on Saturday night, was trending on social media because of the mystery around it: Channel 4 had declined to offer any information about what it contained. But by the time it did air, we knew exactly what it contained.</p><p>The programme is a collaboration between Dispatches and The Sunday Times and, as happens often when a TV show and a newspaper mount a joint investigation, the newspaper went public first.

<p>We no longer expect blind obedience from our children, but if we teach them to be curious about the world and tolerant of each other, then good manners will follow</p><p>Do as you’re told! As a child growing up in the 1960s and 70s, I seemed to hear that phrase all the time; these days, it’s rare to hear parents or teachers utter it. So it was no surprise to read last week that the importance we put on our children being obedient has, according to the World Values Survey, plummeted in the past 30 years. The proportion of Britons who think children should be brought up to be obedient is now 12%, down from 42% in 1990.</p><p>What we value in our kids these days, is, apparently, “hard work” which is up from 29% to 48% over the same period. “Imagination”, is up from 18% to 37%, and “determination and perseverance”, from 31% to 41%. But in some values, we remain roughly the same through the decades: about 85% of British adults see good manners in children as especially important – that

Greet autumn with succulent and flavoursome aubergine and mushroom dishes<p>The few aubergines I have ever grown were outshone by the beauty of their mauve and white flowers and velvet leaves. The fruit itself was bitter in a way that commercially grown aubergines are not nowadays. I had to get the salt pot out and leave the large purple black fruits to sit while the salt softened their flesh and extracted the bitterness from their juice.</p><p>I buy them now, big fat chaps from the Turkish shops or slimmer, elegant ones from the Indian food stores a little further away. Both are good for grilling, but the chunky ones are best of all for braising or casseroles – more flesh, less skin, so they melt into lusciousness.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/sep/17/nigel-slater-recipes-for-braised-aubergines-and-deep-fried-mushrooms-with-sesame">Continue reading...</a>

The lyrics to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xik-y0xlpZ0">A Forest</a>, released in 1979, communicate the general vibe: “The girl was never there/ It’s always the same/ I’m running towards nothing/ Again and again and again and again…” Sadly, the cathartic power of such virtuoso melancholy has not always been obvious to everyone.</p><p>“In conversations I’

The infectious enthusiasm of the host of the wildly popular children’s television show Deadly 60 has educated a generation. So what’s next for Steve Backshall, whose passion has taken a campaigning turn? He talks about marine magic and the UK’s woeful water companies<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/steve-backshall" title="">Steve Backshall</a>’s new book, <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/deep-blue-9781529144109" title="">Deep Blue: My Ocean Journeys</a></em>, begins with a waltz beneath the waves off Vancouver Island off the coast of Canada. His dance partner is a giant Pacific octopus. One moment, writes Backshall, her body flows like muslin in the breeze. Next, it becomes as tense as a bodybuilder’s biceps. Back home, at his idyllic eco-house beside the Thames, the naturalist and presenter of the phenomenally popular <em>Deadly 60 </em>television series is wrestling with a rather less appealing apparition: the sewage flowing down the river.</p><p>At the star

It is still too great a distance for our homesick boy<p>We were touched by our son’s reticence to leave our company and go back to school, so reminded him we’d just be across the road. We were speaking literally here, since his school is on our street and, this year, his entrance directly faces our front door. It’s cut our 20-second commute down to a few seconds, but this was still too great a distance for our homesick boy.</p><p>‘I used to travel for half an hour to get to primary school!’ I told him, ‘and a full hour for secondary!’ I’d like to think I intended this as a comfort, but now realise it was that inescapable reflex of fatherly one-upmanship I’ve inherited from my own dad. If we grumbled about having to travel the last two miles home from school on foot, he’d say we didn’t know we were born. He, of course, travelled to and from school by clambering into the wooden spokes of a passing horsecart, and happily rotated for the full nine hours it took to reach his destination.<

Friction between different ethnicities and faiths hinders the fight against inequality<p>A customer demands a refund on goods she bought but no longer wants. The shop owner refuses, offering a credit note instead. The customer grabs other goods, apparently in recompense. The shop owner tries to stop her from leaving the premises. She appears to hit him and he to assault her, putting his hands around her throat in a chokehold. Police arrest the customer, and then later, after a video of the incident goes viral, interview the shop owner, too.</p><p>Presented like this, most people would see the incident as an argument that got out of hand and probably regard the shop owner as having used unacceptable force.

Novelty shapes are not always my thing, but there’s a time and a place…<p>I am in Poole, Dorset, in an apartment high up in the trees. We almost moved to Poole in 2005; I was working on a book and every morning would walk to the library, then down to the beach to meet my partner and our baby daughter. I’d wonder at the incongruous tors of Special Brew I’d see on my way down, until I discovered that the library car park becomes a dogging paradise at night.</p><p>None of that this time. The library is sheathed in scaffolding and nearby houses have put up high fences.

During his first two years in the role, many thought, including a lot of people who sit in today’s shadow cabinet, he was fated to be another Neil Kinnock: someone who would haul the party back from the brink of oblivion, but not return it to government.

<p>Adverts, MPs and newsreaders have all been caught in the act…</p><p>Whenever I read asterisked swear words in print, and surely you do this, too, I very carefully sound the word out either aloud or in my head. And the feeling it gives me, working out the word from only two letters and an assortment of shapes, is as if I have cracked a secret code or passed a test, which means the word resonates at a higher pitch than its pathetic unstarred pals. It rings like a lovely bell and the stars for letters mean it glitters. Which, I think, must be the very opposite of what was originally intended. Instead of obscuring the word, the asterisks manifest it.</p><p>Sometimes you don’t even need asterisks.

Government must urgently plug the policy gap currently being filled by ideology<p>The argument about the relative importance of sex and gender identity – whether someone feeling they are male or female should replace the reality of sex in law and society – has become one of the most polarising identity issues of our time. But out of this toxic mess a sensible consensus has emerged: both parties have largely ditched commitments to enshrine in law the view that people should be able to self-declare their sex for legal purposes. It has at last been acknowledged that this would effectively dismantle women’s hard-won legal protections for single-sex spaces, services and sports, and these are not inconsistent with robust anti-discrimination protections for trans people.</p><p>But profound disagreements within government and across the public sector continue to leave a policy vacuum that is being filled by activists with no understanding of existing law on sex and gender. Nowhere is that mo

But cram it in he does.</p><p>Isaacson is an experienced biographer, with lives of Einstein, Benjamin Franklin, Leonardo da Vinci, Jennifer Doudna and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/oct/30/steve-jobs-exclusive-biography-review">Steve Jobs</a> to his credit.

The morality was Victorian, ‘militant virginity’ was the order of the day<p>‘Prince Charles had to do it only once, but Americans have to go through it every year.’ What? Find ‘a lovely, poised, intelligent girl who is also a virgin – or a reasonable facsimile’. That’s how the <em>Observer</em> kicked off its exploration into who would take home the crown of Miss America on 4 November 1984.</p><p>The competition was trying to restore its Lysol-clean image following the previous year’s scandal, when winner <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/jul/24/vanessa-williams-miss-america-penthouse" title="">Vanessa Williams</a> posed for ‘naked lesbian photos’ in <em>Penthouse</em> and was forced to abdicate. Getting back on track required a return to ‘white bread Republicanism’ (35 out of 49 contestants were Reagan supporters) and ‘militant virginity’. Propriety was Victorian. Contestants were banned from smoking, drinking or gambling and had to be chaperoned at all times, th

<p>The meadow is full of flowers and the bushes bursting with berries, but it’s the apples we can’t wait to take a bite from</p><p>How green is my garden. Gone the sandy tones of midsummer. To be replaced by a vibrant almost violent lushness. It calls for a scythe like a Van Gogh painting or like Morten our nearest neighbour favours. Instead, I sort the electric strimmer. I need to trim around the currant bushes, the pears, the apple tree. Henri will set the mower to its highest setting.</p><p>It will take at least two trims. Most of the meadow hasn’t been cut since April. It is alive now with pink and white yarrow, yellow lady’s bedstraw, splashes of scattered scarlet poppy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/sep/17/after-a-long-hot-summer-the-apple-tree-is-laden-with-fruit">Continue reading...</a>

You’ve accomplished a lot, says Philippa. Don’t think of life as milestones that must be met by certain ages<p><em><strong>The question </strong>I’m a 29-year-old woman who has never been in a romantic relationship and right now can’t decide on a career path. I have a handful of close friends, graduated from a good university six years ago, but I </em><em>end up in temporary, seasonal hospitality jobs that I work in for about six months before resigning. And as soon as I get close to someone romantically, I push them away. I feel a deep suspicion and mistrust of people getting close to me. For a long time, I felt my friendships were shallow and forced until I spent more time with my friends post-Covid.</em></p><p><em>From the ages of 13 to 17, I went through bouts of depression and anxiety, but didn’t feel able to speak to anyone about it.

Rather than pour scorn on the notion of a minister for men, think how such a role could help some of our most vulnerable people<p>I understand why Martha Gill considers the idea of a minister for men “insulting”, when society remains dominated by male power and women bear the brunt of gender inequality (“<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/sep/09/we-dont-need-a-minister-for-men-we-need-guys-to-fill-female-roles" title="">A Tory MP wants a minister for men. How about one for white people, heterosexuals and the upper classes?</a>”, Comment). However, her preferred analogies are surely no less insulting. Perhaps a minister for the upper classes would indeed make sense if the upper classes were more likely to die prematurely from all comparable causes at every age; if the upper classes were 19 times more likely to be in prison; six times more likely to sleep (or die) rough on the streets; three times more likely to die a death of despair through suicide; or if we had

Keir Starmer promises a humane, pragmatic approach to the growing problem of irregular migration<p>In recent months, the man who looks increasingly likely to be Britain’s next prime minister has been treading a cautious line. Keir Starmer has made clear that under his leadership a first-term Labour government would stick to tough fiscal rules, and has ruled out making any unfunded spending commitments in the run-up to the next election. That has fuelled criticism from some on the left of his party, who argue that this has limited the extent to which he has been able to differentiate a possible future Labour government from the present Conservative one.</p><p>But last week Starmer drew a sharp dividing line between the government and Labour on asylum policy. This government has effectively destroyed the tenets of a workable asylum policy. It has allowed huge delays to develop in processing asylum claims: earlier this year, 83% of claims made in 2018 had not been processed <a href="htt
