After a bus trip from Istanbul to\u00a0Eskisehir, I took a train from Eskisehir to Denizli. The train, called Pamukkale Express, took 8 hours to reach the\u00a0destination but passed through some of the best landscapes of rural Turkey. The train journey is cheaper and more comfortable than a bus trip between Eskisehir and Denizli. Watch this video to know many more reasons to take this train. This video is based on my trip to Turkey in late 2022. #TravelVlog #mountaintrekker #Turkey\n\nTurkey Train tickets online booking - official website - https://ebilet.tcddtasimacilik.gov.tr/\n\n\nIf you like my videos, PLEASE SHARE them and let others get inspired to explore this beautiful world.
