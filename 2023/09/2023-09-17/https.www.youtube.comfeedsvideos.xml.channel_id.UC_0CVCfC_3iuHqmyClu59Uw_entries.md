So recently I picked up a Prepaid 3rd gen 2022 iPhone SE from my local Walmart and in this video we turn it into an awesome Gaming Console! You can use it in handheld mode or even connect to to a big screen display and play your favorite mobile games, Stream games from the cloud or even use Steam link! With console games coming to the new iPhone 15 I wanted to see how  this super cheap device could be used like a gaming console
