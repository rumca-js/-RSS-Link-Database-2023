In 2020, I was the first YouTuber to make a video about “Meshtastic,” created by Kevin Hester. The project name was a merge between Mesh and Fantastic. Already then, I loved the project. But why is it the “most dangerous LoRa project”? Here is the proof: My video was included in a study titled “NETWORK-ENABLED ANARCHY” by an organization featured by the US government under the topic “instructions for encrypted messaging”. So stay tuned when I show you what you can do with it even if you have a normal profession.
