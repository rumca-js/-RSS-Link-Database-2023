There's a bit of bad news if you've been looking forward to fishing horror Dredge's first paid expansion: developer Black Salt Games has delayed its release from Q4 this year into 2024.
</p><p>
More Dredge, both free and paid, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dredges-forthcoming-passive-mode-will-let-you-bob-about-without-the-hassle-of-monster-attacks">confirmed to be on the way</a> back in May, with the game's The Iron Rig expansion - focusing on the machinations of the Ironhaven Corporation - looking to be its most significant chunk of new content.
</p><p>
"Originally, we planned to spend a few months crafting this exciting addition and release it in Q4 this year," Black Salt Games explained in its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1562430/view/3735229909370857320">delay announcement</a>. "However, as we prog

CD Projekt has detailed Cyberpunk 2077's first patch since the sci-fi RPG's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077s-20-update-is-so-good-you-should-consider-restarting-from-scratch">big 2.0 update</a>, promising, among other things, a fix for a save corruption issue affecting PlayStation 5 players.
</p><p>
As per the developer's newly shared <a href="https://support.cdprojektred.com/en/cyberpunk/pc/sp-technical/issue/2509/patch-2-01-coming-soon">pre-release patch highlights</a>, update 2.01 should stop instances of corrupt saves on PS5 by increasing the maximum save file size limit. CD Projekt warns this won't fix saves impacted before the update, but advises affected players to keep a working save - by resaving it as a manual save - until 2.01 arrives.
</p><p>
Elsewhere in the update, CD Projekt is promising per

## Fixed on Switch: No Man's Sky's custom FSR 2 support dramatically improves the game

Packing a low-power mobile processor with technology dating back to 2015, it lacks the technological grunt to keep pace with last-gen console systems - and this can result in some lacklustre third-party ports. In putting together this piece, we decided to circle back and examine some of the most disappointing Switch conversions - and we were happy to discover a range of improvements. In the case of Hello Games' No Man's Sky, we even see the developer deploy the first example we've seen of FSR 2 upscaling on the Nintendo hybrid - and the results are excellent.</p><p>NMS was always going to be a tough Switch port. The open-universe game is understandably taxing on Switch hardware, resulting in poor frame-rates, plenty of pop-in and somewhat dire image quality when it launched las

## Dragon's Dogma 2 feels very similar to the original, for better and worse

Don't go into Dragon's Dogma 2 expecting it to feel massively different from Dragon's Dogma or Dark Arisen. Despite the dozen years since the original game's launch (Dragon's Dogma 2 is set to arrive for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in early 2024), there's no huge change in gameplay, while the visual style of Capcom's fantasy RPG series also feels familiar. 
</p><p>
The game's open world is way more dense in terms of flora and fauna, but its presentation remains similar to that of the original - with its grey, green, brown colour palette used in almost every game released in the early 2010s. And while this was a pre-release build, it did also suffer performance-wise on PS5, with what felt like big frame rate drops during busy battles. I also witnessed a variety of weird bugs involving NPCs and enemies - al

## Fall Guys developer hit hard by Epic Games layoffs, but studio to remain open

Mediatonic, the UK developer behind Fall Guys, has been severely impacted by expected job losses as a result of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-is-reportedly-laying-off-900-employees">yesterday's layoffs by Epic Games</a>, though the studio itself will not be closed.
</p><p>
Epic Games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-acquires-fall-guys-developer-mediatonic">acquired Mediatonic back in March 2021</a> after the studio's battle royale Fall Guys blew up in popularity. The deal was meant to secure Mediatonic's future. Now, despite the studio remaining open, that future looks very different indeed.
</p><p>
Last night, rumours swirled that the cuts were so deep the whole studio would close. But this isn't the case, team members I've spoken to have said, and Epic Games itself has now confirmed. </p> <p><a href="ht

Legacy, the upcoming blockchain business sim from Fable creator Peter Molyneux, is set to release next month, on 26th October.
</p><p>
According to the game's publisher <a href="https://blog.gala.games/launch-date-announced-get-ready-to-build-your-legacy-7db3623b3517">Gala Games</a>, which specialises in this blockchain/Web3 business, Legacy's upcoming launch is "more than just a game release". In its words, this is "the beginning of an extraordinary journey where creativity, strategy, and business innovation meet". 
</p><p>
As someone who remains more than a touch sceptical about blockchain, I feel this remains to be seen.

"Original sketches, concept art, process footage of painting or model work, unused music tracks, orchestra session footage, you name it," Studio MDHR co-director Chad Moldenhauer told <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/09/27/cuphead-xbox-anniversary-update-exclusive-to-xbox-fans/">Xbox Wire</a> discussing the additions.

Following recent leaks and rumours, Mortal Kombat boss Ed Boon is now teasing fans with potential future DLC for the series' most recent release. 
</p><p>
In a new post over on X (formerly Twitter), Boon shared an image of some of media's most famous slasher-flick faces. Leatherface, Freddy Krueger, Jason, Mike Myers, Pinhead, Chucky, Jigsaw, and Ghostface all showed up in Boon's image, with a collection of either ticks or question marks across their faces. 
</p><p>
Many have surmised this means these less than friendly faces will soon be making their way into Mortal Kombat 1 as part of the game's DLC. As one fan noted in the replies, "Jigsaw would be perfect with the new Saw coming out".

The week's Game of the Week was not a tough pick. Cocoon is astonishing stuff, and happily the most thrilling game I have played this year - quite a thing to say when the year's been as rich as 2023. 
</p><p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cocoon-review">I reviewed the game yesterday</a>, but I was very taken with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23890949/cocoon-review-puzzle-game-inside-limbo">Polygon's piece, by Grayson Morley</a>. Morley writes this: "A late-game puzzle involves the creation of an impossibility. Something that seems to break the game&rsquo;s rules, and yet doesn&rsquo;t, under the ever-thickening logic of Cocoon." Firstly, yes, "ever-thickening" is lovely, suggesting that logic is some kind of homeostatic process, something like myelin bunching in the nervous system. Secondly, though, I read that and reali

Embracer and Sony seem to be slowly removing traces of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake from the internet, sparking more concern that its future is in jeopardy. 
</p><p>
It has certainly been a tumultuous journey for this remake. After numerous leaks, Aspyr and Sony officially revealed their <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-announced-for-ps5">remake of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic was in development</a> back in 2021. At this time, it was announced the Star Wars game was being remade "from the ground up", and would launch as a timed console exclusive for PlayStation 5, and also for PC.
</p><p>
Since then, news on the remake has been less than optimistic. In May 2022, Aspyr's parent company Embracer announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net

The final update for Sonic Frontiers is now live and adds playable Tails, Amy and Knuckles for the first time in a 3D game since Sonic 06.
</p><p>
Sega had previously teased the update would bring new playable characters, but now the update is live we know for sure it's those three. Though let's be honest, it was pretty obvious.
</p><p>
The update brings a new story expansion, which takes place before the final boss and envisions an alternative ending, with the three characters attempting to change their own fate. Check out the trailer below to see them in action.

I'm fascinated by the new story missions in Overwatch 2 because in them, I can so clearly see Blizzard's ambitions for a fully-fledged PvE game. Except, of course, that vision didn't pan out and so the work was salvaged and released as paid-for add-ons instead.
