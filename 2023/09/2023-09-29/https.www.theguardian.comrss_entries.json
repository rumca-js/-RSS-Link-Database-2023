But the Democrats must choose a younger candidate if Donald Trump is to be kept out of the White House</p><p>During the two months I spent in the US this summer, I kept asking every journalist, academic and analyst I met one simple question: \u201cWho will be the next president of the United States?\u201d The response was usually the same. First there was a distinct hesitation, then they said \u201cWell, probably Joe Biden,<em> </em>but \u2026\u201d</p><p>What followed the \u201cbut\u201d was a long list of concerns, partly about deeper trends but mainly about how old and frail the 80-year-old president looks.
