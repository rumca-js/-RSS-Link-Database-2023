Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon are both champion racing games, the former depicting accessible, realistic simulation racing with the latter providing a more casual experience, freewheeling through open world vistas.

Both variations possess excellent driving mechanics, and as the series has progressed it's steadily been incorporating unique career play modes, social interaction, and deep vehicle customization, whilst frequently being a leader in immense graphics. 

Ranking all Forza titles might seem a little counterintuitive given the distinct experiences that Motorsport and Horizon bring to the table, but alas here we are. There’s enough connection between the two games to warrant a ranking list, but just to be clear, all Forza games are good. There’s not a dud entry in the entire series.

The amount of critically acclaimed titles released in 2023 has been pretty absurd, with multiple "Game of the Year" contenders to choose from. October continues that pace with even more blockbusters and highly-anticipated sequels.

Want some psychological horror tinged with mystery? The eagerly-awaited Alan Wake 2 has you covered. Want some compelling 2D platforming mixed with contemporary mechanics? Sonic Superstars should do it.

Of course, we also can't discount one of the biggest releases of the year - Marvel's Spider-Man 2 on PS5 - which builds on its predecessors in incredible ways. Check out all of these and other noteworthy titles launching in October.
