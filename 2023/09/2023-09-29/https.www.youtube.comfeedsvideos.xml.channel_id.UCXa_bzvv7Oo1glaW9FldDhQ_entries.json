There\u2019s enough connection between the two games to warrant a ranking list, but just to be clear, all Forza games are good. There\u2019s not a dud entry in the entire series.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9opCzEZLB4w", "date_published": "2023-09-29T19:30:00+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/9opCzEZLB4w/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "15 Games of October 2023 To Look Forward To [PS5, Xbox Series X | S, PC]", "description": "The amount of critically acclaimed titles released in 2023 has been pretty absurd, with multiple \"Game of the Year\" contenders to choose from. October continues that pace with even more blockbusters and highly-anticipated sequels.\n\nWant some psychological horror tinged with mystery? The eagerly-awaited Alan Wake 2 has you covered. Want some compelling 2D platforming mixed with contemporary mechanics? Sonic Superstars should do it.\n\nOf course, we also can't discount one of the biggest releases of the year - Marvel's Spider-Man 2 on PS5 - which builds on its predecessors in incredible ways. Check out all of these and other noteworthy titles launching in October.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNvu5z5St8g", "date_published": "2023-09-29T09:30:16+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/yNvu5z5St8g/hqdefault.jpg"}]
