<p>The film-focused social media site LetterBoxd has new ownership. Cofounder Matthew Buchanan <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://letterboxd.com/journal/a-tiny-announcement-matthew-buchanan/">announced</a> on Friday that Tiny, a venture capital firm, has bought a 60 percent stake in the platform. <em>The New York Times</em> <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/29/business/media/letterboxd-new-owner.html">reported</a><em>&nbsp;</em>that the deal values Letterboxd at over $50 million. Buchanan and fellow founder Karl von Randow will retain minority shareholder positions and continue to lead the company as they insist “very little else will change.”</p>
<p>Founded in 2011, Letterboxd was a rare independently owned social network. It <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/movies/letterboxd-growth.html">grew significantly</a> during pandemic lockdowns as homebound users sought new movies to stream (and communities to cha

<p>A beetle protagonist emerges into a beautiful, lonely world. There’s no preamble, no text overlays; not even a hint of what you’re meant to do next. So, you walk. After finding your way to a small staircase, you descend, and the steps disappear into the ground — a silent cue that you’re on the right path. A few paces further, you discover a purple pad, and as you stand on it, your iridescent wings begin to quiver. Without thinking about it, you press a button on your controller, the pad turns green, and a nearby rock transforms into a new staircase. Progress!</p>
<p>After solving a couple of rudimentary puzzles, you’ll encounter an orb — these are the heart (and the body) of this game. You carry them on your beetle back, initially using them as keys to open doors and solve puzzles, before discovering that inside every orb is a new world of puzzles and challenges to overcome.</p>

<p>The National Security Agency (NSA) is starting a dedicated artificial intelligence security center, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/nsa-artificial-intelligence-security-deepfakes-f9b19dd64890884cc2b0700ddf66e666"><ins>as reported by </ins><em><ins>AP.</ins></em></a> This move comes after the government has begun to increasingly rely on AI, integrating multiple algorithms into defense and intelligence systems. The security center will work to protect these systems from theft and sabotage, in addition to safeguarding the country from external AI-based threats.</p>
<p>The NSA’s recent move toward AI security was announced Thursday by outgoing director General Paul Nakasone. He says that the division will operate underneath the umbrella of the pre-existing Cybersecurity Collaboration Center. This entity works with private industry and international partners to protect the US from cyberattacks stemming from China, Russia and other countries with active malware and hacking campaigns

## The Creator review: A visually stunning, yet deeply shallow, AI epic

<p>Equal parts <em>Terminator</em>, <em>The Golden Child </em>and <em>The Matrix </em>prequel, <em>The Creator</em> is yet another sci-fi epic about a war between humans and AI, one told by someone who just can't shut up about their time backpacking across Asia. Director Gareth Edwards clearly understands the power of scale and spectacle, something he demonstrated with his indie knockout <em>Monsters</em>, as well as his big-budget efforts, <em>Godzilla</em> and <em>Rogue One</em>. But <em>The Creator</em>, like those films, also suffers from a disjointed narrative, weak characters and a surprisingly shallow exploration of its (potentially interesting!) themes. It's a shame — at times, the film also proves he can be a genuine visual poet.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The Creator</em> stars John David Washington, fresh off of Christopher Nolan's Tenet, as Joshua, an American soldier embedded among a group of AI rebels as a double-agent. When an operation goes wrong early on, he loses his rebel wi

<p>An educational center could open up at the site of the famed Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico as soon as early next year, but astronomy research won’t be among its missions. At least, not for now. The National Science Foundation <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://new.nsf.gov/news/nsf-announces-over-5m-funding-create-new-stem"><ins>announced</ins></a> this week that it’s chosen four institutions to take charge of the site’s transition, with a $5.5 million investment over the next five years. It’ll be a hub for STEM education, with a focus on life and computer sciences.</p>
<p>The NSF first revealed its plans for an education center at Arecibo last year after months of uncertainty about its future, confirming then that the telescope would not be rebuilt. The observatory’s main radio telescope <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/arecibo-observatory-collapse-video-details-nsf-172859619.html">suffered a catastrophic collapse in December 2020</a>, when

<p>On Friday, the US Supreme Court <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/09/29/supreme-court-social-media-florida-texas-google-facebook/">agreed</a> to take on two landmark social media cases with enormous implications for online speech, as reported by <em>The Washington Post</em>.

<p>The life of a retro gamer is one fraught with delight and frustration. Chasing the unique feeling of waiting years while someone develops a new game for your <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-21-wyvern-tales-lynx-homebrew-jrpg-irl.html">vintage console of choice</a> in their spare time. But the delight, when it lands, makes it all worth it. Conversely, watching someone snipe your eBay bid for a super rare game you’ve been seeking for years, that’s frustrating. No one appears to understand this yo-yo of emotions better than the team at Analogue — makers of some of the most desirable modern retro consoles around.</p>
<p>When I say Analogue understands this, I mean it’s perfected the art of inducing both ends of that emotional spectrum. The very existence of the company shows it understands the passion retro lovers feel about gaming history.

<p>This week, it’s Meta’s turn to highlight AI during its device event. In this episode, Devindra and Cherlynn dive into all of the news from Meta’s Connect 2023 event, where it unveiled Meta AI and accompanying celebrity-powered chatbots. Oh yah, and it introduced the Meta Quest 3 and new Ray-Ban smart glasses, too. More so than the metaverse and VR, it’s really AI that Zuckerberg wants to push across all of Meta’s apps and devices.</p>
<p>And in other news, we discuss why the end of the WGA strike is a big deal for AI in Hollywood; ex-Microsoft exec Panos Panay officially heading to Amazon; and why the FTC is targeting Amazon over its potential ecommerce monopoly.</p>

<p>Netflix is shipping its final DVD rentals, marking the end of an era that helped make the company the streaming behemoth it is today. &quot;Netflix will mail its final DVD on September 29, 2023,&quot; the company said in a post on X yesterday. &quot;But the red envelope remains an enduring symbol of our love of entertainment.&quot;</p>
<p>Netflix <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-will-shut-down-its-dvd-rental-business-in-september-195213827.html">announced in April</a> this year that it would shut down its DVD rental business on September 29, saying the shrinking demand for physical rentals is making it &quot;increasingly difficult&quot; to offer the quality of service it wants. The company shipped its first disc (Beetlejuice) in 1998, and has since shipped 5.2 billion movies in those red envelopes to more than 40 million customers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just when Microsoft’s buyout of Activision finally seemed to be near complete — and we could focus on Google’s<a href="https://www.engadget.com/federal-judge-narrows-scope-of-antitrust-case-against-google-ahead-of-trial-202837725.html"> legal tussles</a> with the Department of Justice — the Federal Trade Commission said it will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-is-challenging-microsofts-69-billion-buyout-of-activision-again-162844282.html">revive</a> its attempt to block the $69 billion deal in an adjudicative process. Microsoft received EU approval over the summer when the European Commission endorsed the deal as long as the tech giant could ensure “full compliance with commitments.”</p>
<p>Normally, the FTC drops its challenges to deals when efforts are lost in federal court. This move will not delay the deal, though in the worst-case scenario, Microsoft might have to sell off parts of the gaming company. Microsoft told <em>Bloomberg</em> it’s not concerned about the move pr

<p>Google is sending Jamboard on its way to the company's ever-growing graveyard full of products and services that didn't quite work out. It will wind down the Jamboard whiteboarding app sometime in late 2024, it has revealed in a <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/09/the-next-phase-of-digital-whiteboarding-for-google-workspace.html">Workspace post</a>, and will switch to working more closely with third-party partners. Jamboard is the tech giant's home-grown whiteboarding solution that provides people the ability to collaborate in real time. Anything drawn or edited on its website or app, for instance, gets reflected on the Jamboard hardware, and vice versa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To continue giving teams that use its tools access to a collaborative digital whiteboard, Google is integrating FigJam, Lucidspark and Miro across its Workspace. It also promised to provide a &quot;retention and migration path&quot; so that users don't lose any collaborative work they've created w

<p>Tesla has been tolerating racial harassment at its factory in Fremont, California since at least 2015 until today, according to the <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/eeoc-sues-tesla-racial-harassment-and-retaliation">lawsuit filed</a> by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The automaker has violated federal law by tolerating the &quot;widespread and ongoing racial harassment of its Black employees,&quot; the agency said. Further, affected workers who raised concerns about the abuse they were getting were apparently subjected to various forms of retaliation: They were transferred, their duties were changed, or they were terminated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EEOC's lawsuit says Black employees were regularly called variations of the N-word, &quot;monkey,&quot; &quot;boy&quot; and &quot;black b*tch&quot; throughout the factory, even in hubs were workers gathered. These employees also encountered drawings of racial graffiti, including swastikas and nooses, on desks, as
