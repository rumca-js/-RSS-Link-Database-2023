In today's Daily Fix:
Official trailers and other posts announcing the Knights of the Old Republic Remake are being pulled from the internet. Sony says it's because of music licensing issues, but we're not entirely convinced. The game has had a difficult development process so far, even changing development teams not too long ago. In other news, the trophies and achievements list for Marvel's Spider-Man 2 has been leaked, and you may want to avoid reading it if you don't want spoilers. And finally, a "realm of naked men" has been found in Baldur's Gate 3. No, it's not official, it's a bug. Still pretty funny, though.

Disney Plus is planning on cracking down on password sharing come November 1st. Canadian subscribers of #DisneyPlus received quite the alarming email, informing customers of its new policy. The email stated, "Unless otherwise permitted by your Service Tier, you may not share your subscription outside of your household. 'Household' means the collection of devices associated with your primary personal residence that are used by the individuals who reside therein." And while this crackdown on passwords for Disney Plus is specifically rolling out in Canada, it’ll most assuredly be rolled out globally if the results of the roll out in Canada yields positive results for Disney. Just look at Netflix: When it implemented its global crackdown on password sharing back in July, the streaming service apparently saw an increase in revenue due to new users signing up and others changing their subscription tiers. We all knew something like this was coming when CEO Bob Iger announced the company wou

This week Ryan McCaffrey is in the host’s chair, joined by Rebekah Valentine, from IGN’s Nintendo podcast, Nintendo Voice Chat, and Destin Legarie from our Xbox podcast, Podcast Unlocked. The topic: the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro MAX. The latest smartphones from Apple have enough power to run Triple-A games natively from the devices themselves. Does that make the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro MAX gaming consoles? Will developers be more active in putting out their best games onto mobile, and how much is the public willing to play for a big-budget game on their phone?
