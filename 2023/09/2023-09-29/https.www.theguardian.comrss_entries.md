So much for that cosy theory. By the end a brilliant New Zealand had accelerated so far out of sight they were barely visible on the scoreboard, a first-half hat-trick from the wonderfully sharp Aaron Smith leaving the Azzurri to play catch-up from an early stage.</p><p>It also provided a reminder, as if it were needed, that New Zealand cannot be discounted when the knock-out stages of this tournament finally come around. The setbacks of the past month have clearly stung and a week’s rest has recharged their batteries. The upshot was one of those nights when the All Blacks make rugby look so gloriously simple that the opposition barely know where to put themselves.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/sep/29/smith-hat-trick-inspires-new-zeal

<p>She became San Francisco mayor after an assassination but her last days in the Senate brought questions about age and infirmity</p><p>Dianne Feinstein was the oldest serving senator, and the longest-serving woman in the Senate at time of her death on Friday. At 90, she was a tenacious trailblazer, and a stalwart centrist – with a sweeping political career that arcs across immense transformations in Washington DC but also in her home state of California.</p><p>It was a hard-won career that almost never was. In the late 70s, before she was senator, before she became San Francisco mayor, Feinstein’s political ambitions had stagnated. After serving nine years on the board of supervisors, she had lost two bids for mayor. Her moderate agenda and centrism had isolated her from leftists and conservatives. By 1978, her husband had died of cancer, as had her father – and Feinstein, then 45, had told reporters she was ready to retire from politics.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us

<p>For centuries the achievements of women have been ignored in classical composition. That can’t go on</p><p>The history of women overshadowed and elbowed aside by men is nowhere more dispiriting than in classical composing, but turn that proposition on its head and there are discoveries to be made that refresh the canon. The story of “the other Mendelssohn” is a case in point. Fanny Hensel – her married name – was the talented older sister of Felix Mendelssohn. She learned composition alongside her brother, but was confined as an adult to organising and performing in Sunday music salons at the Berlin home of their wealthy banking family. By the time she died, aged 41, she had composed more than 400 pieces.

<p>Aston Villa’s manager is a big admirer of the style of Robert De Zerbi’s high-flying Seagulls as they prepare to go head-to-head</p><p>If someone told Unai Emery at the start of this season that his Aston Villa team would finish above Brighton, would he consider it a successful campaign? Emery chuckles under his breath ever so slightly, sufficient time to think of a quip. “They have started very strong,” he replies, smiling.</p><p>The inference is there and the reality is Villa and Brighton, who meet on Saturday lunchtime and were separated by a point last season, are trying to outdo each other.

Into his meticulously staged works he introduced subtle imperfections to stir disquiet in his audience: “There should be a riddle in every powerful image, so you are intrigued and invited to look over and over again.”</p><p>He was influenced by the storytelling power of cinema and the emotion it could provoke. He wanted to create an open-ended narrative in a single shot, to capture the moment between what just happened and what is about to happen. In 2014 he said: “I used to want to conquer the world with strong images, but nowadays I want to say to the viewer:

Chris Kaba’s family deserve better than this</p><ul><li>Sue Fish is a former chief constable</li></ul><p>Policing has a problem with accountability – one that I saw throughout my time as an officer and, later, as chief constable. This stems from the belief, held by much of the police service, that it is under constant attack from all sides, and that a lily-livered leadership is failing to support it, or understand the challenges of delivering frontline policing. The narrative of the “hero cop” looms large, as does the notion of the “thin blue line”, which has other connotations in the US, but in the UK symbolises the cops holding back the tide of lawlessness in the face of a hostile public and press.</p><p>As a result, too many officers believe that the law applies differently to them. That can result in an unwarranted arrest here, a strip-search there, checking police systems for contact details, and worse. Ma

<p>The author explains how Just Like Mother, her gothic horror tale of a cult fixated on childbearing, is uncomfortably close to reality</p><p>Anne Heltzel was single, in her mid-30s and living in New York when the comments started coming. “Maybe having a family just isn’t for you,” her city friends would say, their voices sympathetic. “Don’t worry, you still have time,” her Midwestern family would add in placating tones. But Heltzel wasn’t worried; she had never felt a “natural instinct” to become a mother. Still, she was prompted to think harder about whether or not she wanted children. “I found that I didn’t know,” she says. “I still have no idea, honestly.”</p><p>Heltzel, now 39, finds the cultural expectation to become a mother “claustrophobic”. That fear became fodder for her debut adult novel, Just Like Mother. The modern gothic horror story follows a childless woman, Maeve, who was raised in a commune run by the Mother Collective – a cult that claims being a mother is “the fu

<p>They may never dazzle, but your favourite fast food chain never really burns its bridges</p><p>Restaurant food can be the epitome of comfort eating. That may sound a strange thing to say, because the entire process of visiting a restaurant requires pulling on a combo of accoutrements to make yourself acceptable to the outside world: pants, matching socks, mascara. It also usually involves a painful experience with a parking app and a table troublingly close to “other people”, whom we all by and large agree are hell.</p><p>But there is a side to eating out that is rarely celebrated, and that thrives on providing a moment of comfort: the chain. Come as you are, come dishevelled, hungover, heartbroken, alone or with a rabble. We’re not going on a culinary journey; rather, this is a culinary cul-de-sac where you’ve been doing a three-point turn for the past 20 years. In fact, I’m fairly sure that, at a moment’s notice, I could step in for the 2pm-10pm shift at <a href="https://www.wag

<p>Jeff Daniels reads this memoir-cum-oral history of the late actor, painting a picture of a flawed, melancholic, chaotic and brilliant screen icon</p><p>Drawn from conversations between the late actor Paul Newman and screenwriter Stewart Stern, The Extraordinary Life of an Ordinary Man sees the Cool Hand Luke star reflecting on a life marked by dizzying success and psychological pain. The interviews, which took place over five years from 1986, were seemingly forgotten until Newman’s children unearthed them in 2019 and turned them into this memoir-cum-oral history.</p><p>It documents his chaotic early life in Ohio as the son of an overbearing, unpredictable mother and a “dismissive, disinterested” father. The household “contained the sounds of constant warfare” as his parents fought viciously. At college, he went wild, drinking and partying. There was a stint in the navy, after which he worked in provincial theatre where he met and married his first wife, Jackie Witte, to whom he wa

The steadily shortening days and warm autumnal light herald the transition to more gentle times in the garden. Yet there are still plenty of summer crops to harvest and the autumnal ones – damsons, hops, apples, winter squash – are arriving.

<p>Military exemption is as big a prize as the gold medal up for grabs for Paris Saint-Germain’s South Korean star</p><p>For Son Heung-min in 2018, read Lee Kang-in in 2023. Five years ago, Tottenham Hotspur reluctantly released their South Korea forward to participate in the Asian Games and he arrived in Indonesia midway through the tournament to lead the team to gold. This month, Paris Saint-Germain belatedly allowed Lee to fly to China and the midfielder arrived just before the group stage ended ready to help the team go all the way once more. The reason why big clubs from the capitals of England and France and elsewhere have allowed such talent to leave when they are not obliged to by Fifa is the same: the South Korean government grants military exemption to those who win gold at the Games.</p><p>The pressure was greater on Son because 2018 was his last chance before turning 28, the age by which all able-bodied men must report for duty that usually lasts between 18 and 21 months.

But then came some thrilling news: a 10-metre tall example had been spotted in the Mauritian highlands. And soon Kew’s scientists were wading through a guava thicket in the east African island nation to take some cuttings.</p><p>Those scientists would go on to make a remarkable discovery.

<p>Invest in good base layers, and exercise will feel like a pleasure, not a chore</p><p>I once read about a restaurateur who chooses cutlery for his establishment wearing a blindfold. Which sounds crazy, but is sort of brilliant. The logic being that no one looks at their knife and fork while they are eating, but the feel and function of cutlery in your hand – the weight, the balance, the sharpness – are what matter. To pick cutlery that will most enhance your dinner, it is best not to be distracted by what it looks like. <br /><br />The knife-and-fork method is also the best way to choose your fitness clothes. How leggings, a sports bra or a pair of trainers feel is a more useful metric than how nice they look on some pert, ponytailed influencer. While you are exercising (whether that means pilates or parkour or pickleball) you are hyperaware of your physical self, so clothes are central to your experience.</p><p>An itchy inside leg seam, badly fitting shorts that wriggle up your b

<p>He swam underneath me and lifted me out of the water on his flipper</p><p>When I was a kid in Pennsylvania, my family rehabilitated wild animals. I grew up with raccoons and a fox running around the house. We would go travelling to Bermuda and I would watch the whales off the shore.

Now I’ve been studying whales for more than 30 years and am the president of the Center for Cetacean Research and Conservation, mostly based in the Cook Islands and Bermuda.</p><p>In 2017, I was on a boat around Rarotonga in the Cook Islands, working on a film about whale conservation.

It will usually give you smoother skin in a week.</p><p>2. <strong>If a product is en route to the plughole, </strong><strong>spend less on it <br /></strong>Everyone wants to know where to splurge and where to scrimp, and my advice is always this: spend the least on things that are quickly washed away (cleanser, body and face wash), saving the extra cash for the products that sit on your skin all day, like serum and foundation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/sep/29/21-things-ive-learned-about-skin-care-sali-hughes">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Thrill Jockey)</strong><br />The North Carolinian’s poetic lyrics, blissful vocals and thrumming banjo and fiddle combine on an album full of warmth and feeling</p><p>Sally Anne Morgan’s music sounds as though it has crept out of the backwoods of her native North Carolina, her voice, banjo and fiddle thrumming with the wet heaviness of that region’s stormy summers. As a member of folk duo House and Land and Appalachian old-time-music band Black Twig Pickers, her work usually twists from the roots of traditional songs and instrumentals. Her new album, Carrying (her third solo album after 2020’s Thread and 2021’s Cups) clings to something in the present, however: the strangeness of becoming a mother and the arrival of her first child.</p><p>Beekeeper, a solo banjo instrumental played by Morgan, opens the album. Warm, resonant string patterns suggest a natural process repeating itself, every time in slightly different, productive ways. The Center follows, with lyrics that wo

It was not through want of trying.

When she was young, she would use gigantic rolls of wallpaper to draw intricate schematics of interconnected rabbit warrens, and “each little rabbit had a room with sofas and all these things”. Then, in high school, she became obsessed with making photorealistic pencil illustrations, “to the point where it felt like the thing was jumping off the page”. Now 32, as Hannah Diamond, she is making the musical equivalent of photorealism: bright, synthetic, earnest songs, with her own high-gloss visuals. It’s some of the past decade’s most influential pop music and iconography, filtering through to the mainstream even though none of it has ever entered the UK charts.</p><p>Diamond debuted a decade ago with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/wat

They are the first to know that their superpowers are derived from Vought’s elixir Compound V that was given to them by their parents.</p><p>Gen V is on Amazon Prime Video.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/sep/29/gen-v-review-this-teen-spinoff-of-the-boys-is-extraordinary">Continue reading...</a>

He approaches parenting in an authoritarian way and I can see the negative impact this has on our daughters’ self-esteem and self worth.</strong></p><p><strong>They are delightful young people and I am very proud of how thoughtful, intelligent and individual they are – the horror stories of parenting teens are not something that I have to worry about and I have an open, respectful relationship with them.

It had been erected to cut off access to Philippine boats, the Philippine coast guard alleged, accusing their counterparts of violating international law.
