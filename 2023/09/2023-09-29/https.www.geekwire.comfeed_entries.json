The fresh cash will help boost its telehealth program that aims to help individuals facing alcohol and opioid use disorders. The program includes addiction-related medication, professional care and oversight, and peer support. Founded in 2021, the startup offers a program to treat substance use disorders that it claims has an 86% success rate.
