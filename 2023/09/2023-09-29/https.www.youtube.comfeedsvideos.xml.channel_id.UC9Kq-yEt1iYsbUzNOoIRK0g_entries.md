What started out as a refreshingly straight-and-to-the point tight 90-minute action movie starring Keanu Reeves shooting people has morphed into an expansive world of assassins with a whole bunch of lore and special coins. The latest installment in the franchise is John Wick Chapter 4, clocking in at a wild 3 hours of runtime.

John Wick Chapter 4 definitely raises some questions. Like how does John keep surviving the impossible? Do the cops really not care about all this public bloodshed at highly recognizable locations? How does John manage to travel internationally as he does? Is he really gone, or are we going to bring him back somehow?

To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to John Wick Chapter 4!
