A deleted scene from The Office about Barack Obama's inauguration.

Target is the latest company to shut down stores because they can't afford to stay open. Yes, all in progressive cities.

No, not the "Donald Duck" line. More pathetic than Christie using "Donald Duck" to point out how Trump is afraid to debate (Donald is DUCKING the debate, get it?) is how proud he was of himself for it. The two most morbidly obese GOP candidates aside, it was Christie mentioning Joe Biden sleeping with a teacher's union member that Rep.

One of those issues is what Donald Trump rants about at 3 AM. The other issue is waiting to see what Trump rants about at 3 AM. Things that affect the country, like our Southern Border being overwhelmed by illegal asylum migrants, get buried. Plus, acknowledging the Biden Border Crisis out loud means speaking negatively about a progressive policy. Since the content creators in the media won't take a look, Elon Musk went to the border to see for himself.</p><p>Luckily for Elon, he owns a social media platform that allows him to livestream.
