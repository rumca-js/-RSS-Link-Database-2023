Online technology is fundamentally reshaping employee evaluations. In the last decade or so, companies such as IBM, Amazon, and General Electric have adopted performance feedback apps that allow employees to "review" one another in real time. These apps take the 360-degree paradigm to its logical extreme by removing temporal, hierarchical, and geographical barriers to feedback.

Data show that students who have a strong science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) identity are more likely to take STEM courses and persist to the academic finish line––graduation. Positive STEM identity is multifaceted, but at the core, it is the sense that one "belongs" in STEM and can succeed in STEM. A person with strong STEM identity tends to feel confident of the following:

Many are frustrated by how those in power seem indifferent to workers' views—particularly those without degrees. It finds also that these issues have been building for some time and are a barrier to tackling the challenges facing the country.

The micro/nano metal pattern formation is a key step in the assembly of various devices. However, ex situ approaches of metal patterning limited their industrial applications due to the poor stability and dispersion of metal nanoparticles. The in situ electroless deposition after lithography patterning may be a better choice for avoiding the growth and aggregation of metal particles in the polymers.

In 1960, while preparing for the first meeting on the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI), legendary astronomer and SETI pioneer Dr. Frank Drake unveiled his probabilistic equation for estimating the number of possible civilizations in our galaxy—aka The Drake Equation. A key parameter in this equation was ne, the number of planets in our galaxy capable of supporting life—aka "habitable." At the time, astronomers were not yet certain other stars had systems of planets. But thanks to missions like Kepler, 5,523 exoplanets have been confirmed, and another 9,867 await confirmation.

Astronomers are working hard to understand biosignatures and how they indicate life's presence on an exoplanet. But each planet we encounter is a unique puzzle. When it comes to planetary atmospheres, carbon is a big piece of the puzzle because it has a powerful effect on climate and biogeochemistry. If scientists can figure out how and where a planet's carbon comes from and how it behaves in the atmosphere, they've made progress in solving the puzzle.

Most drugs are small molecules that bind firmly to a specific target—some molecule in human cells that is involved in a disease—in order to work. For example, a cancer drug's target might be a molecule that is abundant inside of cancer cells. The drug should hypothetically travel freely throughout the cell until it comes to its target and then lock onto it, leading to a therapeutic action.

Scientists show that the extraordinary diversity of cichlid fish in Africa's Lake Victoria was made possible by "genetic recycling"—repeated cycles of new species appearing and rapidly adapting to different roles in the ecosystem. An evolutionary case study that has fascinated researchers for decades, the new study sheds light on how 500 species of fish were able to emerge and thrive in just 16,000 years.

Solid materials are generally known to be rigid and unmoving, but scientists are turning this idea on its head by exploring ways to incorporate moving parts into solids. This can enable the development of exotic new materials such as amphidynamic crystals—crystals which contain both rigid and mobile components—whose properties can be altered by controlling molecular rotation within the material.

In 2022, the Penn Museum announced that it would rebury the skulls of dozens of Black Philadelphian individuals whose remains were unethically obtained in the mid-1800s. Some in the community of the individuals' descendants, who felt they were not consulted, filed a formal opposition to Penn Museum's plan. In 2023, a judge ruled that the community had no legal standing to decide how their dead are treated.

Would it be possible to identify disease-resistant corals by their genetic makeup? And if the hardier types were specially selected for underwater coral nurseries, would the result be healthier reef systems?

DNA phosphorothioate (PT)-modification, with a non-bridging oxygen in the phosphodiester backbone substituted by sulfur, is an epigenetic marker in prokaryotes and is involved in the bacterial defense system, anti-oxidative stress, and gene regulation. PT-modification is specifically recognized by sulfur binding domains (SBDs) of PT-dependent restriction endonucleases, making it a potential tool for enabling biotechnology development. However, the unclear recognition sequence-range of SBDs limits the application.

Periodontal disease is one of the most common canine diseases, affecting at least 80% of dogs aged three and over. Periodontal disease begins as gingivitis, where gums become red and inflamed, and may bleed. Untreated, the disease can progress to periodontitis, where the alveolar bone is progressively damaged so that teeth may loosen or fall out. In turn, periodontitis is a risk factor for other diseases like cardiovascular and lung disease.
