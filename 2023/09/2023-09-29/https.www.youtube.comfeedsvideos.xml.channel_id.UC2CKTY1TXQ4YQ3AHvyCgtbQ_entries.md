I've been sitting on the Aquila Lander sprue from Battle for Macragge for 15 YEARS, and now I decided to speedpaint it - was it a good idea?

Vince Venturella and I made another game! Check out MAJESTIC 13 at http://www.majestic13game.com

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
