		Following the Attorney-General's Privacy Act Review <a href="https://www.ag.gov.au/rights-and-protections/publications/privacy-act-review-report">Report</a>, the Albanese government has announced its proposals to protect its citizens against identity fraud and scams and ensure the global business competitiveness of Australia.

The initial Privacy Act Review Report, released in February 2023, aimed to clarify the act’s scope, uplift individual protections, provide clarity for regulated entities and bolster enforcement tactics. Over 500 public responses were considered in the government's recently released official <a href="https://www.ag.gov.au/rights-and-protections/publications/government-response-privacy-act-review-report">response</a> to the report. In its response, t

The plaintiffs, who have worked for two Chicago-area hospitals, say that the state's Biometric Information Privacy Act protects them from being forced to submit their biometric data the same as any private-sector employees in the state are protected.

The defendants include University of Chicago's Ingalls Memorial Hospital, Northwestern Memorial Healthcare and medical device maker <a href="https://www.bd.com/en-us">Becton,

Microsoft's professional network service LinkedIn has agreed to work with U.S. ID verification service <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/clear">CLEAR</a> to give LinkedIn members in Mexico CLEAR's service. It is a not-insignificant benefit for intensive users of LinkedIn as it will provide a high degree of certainty about identities.

The LinkedIn subscribers, reportedly numbering 20 million, will be able to use an official ID and a selfie, following instructions in English or Spanish, to create CLEAR accounts.

LinkedIn and CLEAR opened free accounts last year to subscribers in the <a href="https://www.b

		While independent testing is important for biometrics security, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/ibeta">iBeta</a> notes that the standards underpinning the most common tests do not apply to all technologies or projects. That does not mean that independent testing is impossible for those biometric systems; instead, the testing lab proposes, they should consider Ad Hoc testing.

		Biometrics testing is an important aspect of the security industry, particularly in the field of authentication and access control. With the increasing need for secure authentication methods, biometric testing has gained significant attention.

Biometric “bake-off” events are a particular kind of performance testing, which are conducted to compare and evaluate different biometric systems to determine their suitability for a particular application.
