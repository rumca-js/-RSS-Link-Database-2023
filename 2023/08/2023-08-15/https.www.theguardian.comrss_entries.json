The 13 new counts added to the scorecard bring the total \u2013 so far \u2013 to 91.

The federal case also addresses his attempts to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia.

It does not require prosecutors to prove that defendants directly broke the law, but that they knowingly coordinated with others who did so. The charging of 18 alleged co-conspirators may increase the likelihood of former associates flipping and assisting the prosecution.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/15/the-guardian-view-on-trumps-latest-charges-the-case-for-the-cases-against-an-ex-president\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/15/the-guardian-view-on-trumps-latest-charges-the-case-for-the-cases-against-an-ex-president", "date_published": "2023-08-15T17:56:32+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "The Guardian view on students\u2019 mental health: young adults need tailored support | Editorial", "description": "<p>Recent deaths at universities point to the vulnerability of older adolescents.

This might not seem so remarkable: many people \u2013 the famous, the semi-famous, the completely insignificant \u2013 have spent a lot of time apologising on Twitter for their former selves. But when Albini decided to acknowledge his past in direct terms, with no qualification or defensiveness \u2013 \u201cA lot of things I said and did from an ignorant position of comfort and privilege are clearly awful and I regret them\u201d went one line in what became a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/electricalWSOP/status/1448050174614392832\" title=\"\">viral thread</a> \u2013 it engendered a somewhat astonished reaction along the lines of: \u201cDamn, if Steve Albini is saying this, then nobody else has an excuse.\u201d</p><p>Possibly you are wondering why it matters that Albini \u2013 from afar merely a middle-aged American musician who tweets a lot about poker and US politics \u2013 was re-evaluating his past. He\u2019s never written a hit single or performed on a late-night television show or sung a melody that could be described as catchy. His most famous song, Kerosene, is a six-minute case for the recreational merits of arson. But his significance vastly outweighs his fame. Even today, the mention of his name conjures a complete worldview that, years after its peak, still inspires deep respect and occasional controversy. Albini \u2013 and I can\u2019t say this without it sounding a little silly because of the way the music industry has conspired for decades to sand off the edges of any once-transgressive cultural movement, but more on that later \u2013 is a genuine punk rocker. Not because he plays music with distorted guitars or exudes contempt for pretentious establishment figures \u2013 though he has done plenty of that \u2013 but because throughout his career he, perhaps more than anyone else, has attempted to embody the righteous ideological tenets that once made punk rock feel like a true alternative to the tired mainstream.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/15/the-evolution-of-steve-albini-if-the-dumbest-person-is-on-your-side-youre-on-the-wrong-side\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/15/the-evolution-of-steve-albini-if-the-dumbest-person-is-on-your-side-youre-on-the-wrong-side", "date_published": "2023-08-15T04:00:34+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Australia v England: key match-ups that could decide World Cup semi-final | Kieran Pender", "description": "<p>Where Wednesday\u2019s last-four clash between the Matildas and Lionesses could potentially be won and lost</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2023/jul/20/womens-world-cup-2023-golden-boot-top-goalscorers-game-by-game\">Golden boot tracker</a>; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2023/jul/17/womens-world-cup-2023-your-guide-to-all-736-players#australia\">guide to all 736 players</a>; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/womens-world-cup-2023/all\">full coverage</a></li></ul><p>On Wednesday host nation Australia face England in Sydney in the second semi-final of this Women\u2019s World Cup.
