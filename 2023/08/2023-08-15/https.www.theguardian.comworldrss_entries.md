<p>Charging document, staggering in its breadth and ambition of its charges, may represent greatest legal peril for ex-president to date</p><p>There’s no other way to say it: the 98-page indictment <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/14/donald-trump-georgia-indictment-2020-election">handed down</a> by a Fulton county grand jury on Monday represents the most aggressive effort to hold Donald Trump and allies accountable for their efforts to overturn the 2020 election.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/14/donald-trump-fulton-county-georgia-indictment-charges-pdf">document</a> is staggering in its breadth and the ambition of its charges. The 41 counts of crimes in it, including 13 against Trump, detail the lies the former president and his co-defendants told the public about fraud to try and keep him in power. It doesn’t back away from charging Trump’s attorneys and inner circle with crimes for coordinating a plan to create slates of fake electors and to stop Congress from counting votes. Some of the state’s 16 fake electors themselves also face charges. And it also casts a wide net, not letting those who breached voting equipment and intimidated poll workers off the hook.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/15/georgia-indictment-trump-election-plot-analysis">Continue reading...</a>
