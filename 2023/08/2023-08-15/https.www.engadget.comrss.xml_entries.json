The tech to do this already exists, and murky legislation lets it happen, speakers from the Legal Aid Society said at DEF CON last Friday.</p><p>\u201cTechnically and legally there's not much really truly blocking the government from getting the information they want if they want it,\u201d Allison Young, digital forensics analyst at The Legal Aid Society, told Engadget. It\u2019s easy, too. Without picking up any new skills or tools, Young was able to find sensitive data that could be used to, for example, prosecute someone being targeted for getting an abortion as it becomes increasingly illegal across the country.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The problem isn\u2019t just the state of local law either, but it\u2019s embedded in the Constitution. As Diane Akerman, digital forensics attorney at the Legal Aid Society explained, the Fourth Amendment hasn\u2019t been updated to account for modern problems like digital data. The <a href=\"https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/educational-resources/about-educational-outreach/activity-resources/what-does-0\">Fourth Amendment</a> intends to protect people from \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures\u201d by the US government. This is where we get legal protections like warrants, where law enforcement needs court approval to look for evidence in your home, car or elsewhere.</p><p>Today, that includes your digital belongings too, from your phone to the cloud and beyond, making way for legal loopholes as tech advancements outpace the law. For example, there\u2019s no way to challenge a search warrant prior to it being executed, Akerman said. For physical evidence that makes some sense because we don\u2019t want someone flushing evidence down a toilet.</p><p>That\u2019s not how your social media accounts or data in the cloud work though, because those digital records are much harder to scrub. So, law enforcement can get a warrant to search your device, and there\u2019s no process to litigate in advance whether the warrant is appropriate. Even if there\u2019s reason for the warrant, Akerman and Young showed that officers can use intentionally vague language to search your entire cell phone when they know the evidence may only be in one account.</p><p>\u201cYou litigate the issues once they already have the data, which means cat is out of the bag a lot of the time and even if it's suppressed in court, there's still other ways it can be used in court,\u201d Akerman said. \u201cThere's no oversight for the way the government is executing words on digital devices.\u201d</p><p>The issue only exacerbates across the third-party apps you use. According to the Fourth Amendment, if you give your information to a third party you\u2019ve lost any sense of privacy, Akerman said. The government can often very easily get information from the cloud because of that, even if it\u2019s not entirely relevant to the case. \u201cYou would be furious if police busted down your door and copied five years of texts for you walking out on a parking ticket five years ago, it's just not proportional,\u201d Young said.</p><p>There are no easy ways for an individual to better protect themselves from these searches. On a case by case basis, there are ways to lock down your device, but that changes with every update or new feature, Young said. Instead, both speakers pushed to put the onus back on the systems and structures that uphold this law, not the individuals affected by it.</p><p>\u201cI live in a world where I have to opt out of modern society to not have other people housing my data in some way,\u201d Akerman said. \u201cThe question really should be like, what responsibility do those people have to us, since they have made us into their profit, rather than forcing me to opt out in order to protect myself?\u201d</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/government-warrant-search-phone-cloud-fourth-amendment-legal-191533735.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/government-warrant-search-phone-cloud-fourth-amendment-legal-191533735.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-08-15T19:15:33+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "X is slowing down links to websites Elon Musk has publicly feuded with", "description": "<p>It appears that Elon Musk is, once again, punishing websites run by his perceived enemies.

Most of the popular options available today hit on the essentials, providing a giant and diverse library of music that you can access \u00e0 la carte, sort into playlists, download for offline listening and play across multiple devices. Most are available for about the same price, too. That said, there are subtle yet significant differences in features and philosophy among them that can determine which will fit into your life best. To assist those thinking about trying a new music app, we\u2019ve spent the past several months using most popular music streaming services simultaneously, testing their limits and seeing how they adapt to our tastes.</p><h2><br />Most well-rounded: Apple Music</h2><p></p><p>No audio streaming service is perfect, but for many, <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MTMwZTJmMC1hMTRmLTRjNWUtYmRhYi1jZDUyYWM3ZDhlNzkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL2FwcGxlLW11c2ljLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNWJmOWExNjYtMWI0Ni00MTU2LWFkYTMtMjhmYTQzZmZiMTUyIn0&amp;signature=AQAAARD3y1YgVtvRlerqlh4WYfgG-aNkPj9yVyouxPguAbcZ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-music%2F\">Apple Music</a> should get the closest to covering all of the necessary bases. It has a library of more than <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-100-million-songs-175703163.html\">100 million songs</a>, all of which are available in lossless, CD-or-better streaming quality for no extra cost. Its user interface doesn\u2019t make it <em>too</em> hard to get to your music library and strikes a balance between useful algorithmic recommendations and smartly curated content from actual people. One of its relatively unique features is that it lets you upload your own music files and naturally it\u2019s tightly integrated with Apple devices.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Apple Music\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Lossless_Audio_Codec\">ALAC</a> files have a minimum resolution of 16-bit/44.1kHz, which is the same quality you\u2019d hear from a CD. A smaller but still significant selection can stream at higher resolutions up to 24-bit/192kHz. A significant number of albums are also available in Dolby Atmos surround sound mixes, or \u201cspatial audio.\u201d</p><p>Lossless audio isn\u2019t a game-changer for most casual listeners. You need a decent set of wired headphones and an <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-best-dac-for-lossless-high-resolution-music-iphone-android-160056147.html\">external DAC</a> (or a good speaker system) to take full advantage, and the upgrade isn\u2019t so stark that non-enthusiasts will care. That said, even if the difference is subtle, a lossless file <em>can</em> sound better than a more compressed one, particularly in the way it draws out higher-frequency sounds from cymbals, strings and the like.</p><figure><img alt=\"A screenshot of the Apple Music app on web browsers.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/bce53770-d3c5-11ed-bbff-39ca47df1c4f\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>Spatial audio, on the other hand, is more of a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sonos-era-300-review-a-big-bet-on-spatial-audio-130053487.html\">fun gimmick</a>: technologically impressive, yes, and sometimes genuinely immersive, but just as likely to make a record sound less natural.</p><p>Relative to other music streaming services, Apple Music\u2019s UI is perfectly serviceable. In general, it emphasizes human curation more than peers like Spotify or YouTube Music. It\u2019s not as great an emphasis as it used to be, and the home \u201cListen Now\u201d tab can be a smorgasbord of hit-and-miss suggestions based on your recent listening history. Still, the service is littered with clever, editor-picked playlists. The default search page holds several different genre tabs, each of which holds relevant playlists, music videos and a typically spot-on list of \u201cessential albums.\u201d Artist pages often spotlight a group\u2019s most essential works alongside playlists of \u201cdeep cuts,\u201d artists that likely inspired them, artists that were influenced by them and so on.</p><p>Apple Music isn\u2019t as adept as Spotify when it comes to actively recommending new music you may like, but a new \u201c<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-will-help-you-find-new-songs-and-artists-with-discovery-station-051205049.html\">Discovery Station</a>\u201d has helped it make strides. This is an algorithmic station that only plays tracks you haven\u2019t streamed before, from both familiar artists and those new to you. The kind of songs included on the playlist will morph alongside your listening history, and Apple says you won\u2019t hear the same track twice. While it\u2019s not a real substitute for Spotify\u2019s \u201cDiscover Weekly\u201d playlist \u2013 I\u2019ve found it a bit too willing to surface established acts before it digs into more obscure artists, and as with all algorithmic playlists, not every song will be a winner \u2013 it gets the gist of your tastes right, and its suggestions should only improve the more you use the service. It\u2019s a welcome addition.</p><p>Streaming radio stations are one of Apple Music\u2019s biggest differentiators. There\u2019s a regular rotation of shows that feature artist interviews and have a sort of pre-internet feel. The main tabs often make room to highlight new buzzy releases, and you can find top charts for different countries and cities. All of this gives Apple Music an air of taste, something that can help you find music but prioritizes a personal touch.</p><figure><img alt=\"A collage of screenshots for the Apple Music app on iOS.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/23a6e940-d3c6-11ed-9ef5-2989d4b3686c\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>Beyond that, getting a simple view of your saved artists, albums, songs and playlists is uncomplicated. You can reliably search for tracks by lyrics, and there\u2019s a great lyrics view for impromptu karaoke sessions. Creating playlists and downloading albums for offline listening is straightforward, and you can start a radio station from any song. While your imported music won\u2019t be available in lossless quality, being able to upload music at all is a great boon for those with big iTunes libraries. Just note that you\u2019re capped at 100,000 tracks that aren\u2019t already available in the app.</p><p>If you enjoy classical music, Apple <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-classical-is-now-available-globally-082516950.html\">recently launched</a> an Apple Music Classical app that\u2019s dedicated to the genre and comes included with most Apple Music plans. Booting those works into a separate app is somewhat cumbersome, though.</p><p>There are still some drawbacks. While Apple Music has apps for Android, Windows and web browsers, the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcHMubWljcm9zb2Z0LmNvbS9zdG9yZS9kZXRhaWwvYXBwbGUtbXVzaWMtcHJldmlldy85UEZIREQ2Mk1YUzE_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&amp;signature=AQAAAYzwFU4GaQCEBMt4mA41MCWHOXRmVm0T84rHPHej9vmK&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.microsoft.com%2Fstore%2Fdetail%2Fapple-music-preview%2F9PFHDD62MXS1%3FranMID%3D24542%26ranEAID%3Dtv2R4u9rImY%26ranSiteID%3Dtv2R4u9rImY-.eTI6GjSea8syjSR2nuC7A%26epi%3Dtv2R4u9rImY-.eTI6GjSea8syjSR2nuC7A%26irgwc%3D1%26OCID%3DAIDcmm549zy227_aff_7593_1243925%26tduid%3D%2528ir__g9c6ndmiuskf62xp01fwtmke1v2xeqzwdxwnwnoe00%2529%25287593%2529%25281243925%2529%2528tv2R4u9rImY-.eTI6GjSea8syjSR2nuC7A%2529%2528%2529%26irclickid%3D_g9c6ndmiuskf62xp01fwtmke1v2xeqzwdxwnwnoe00\">Windows app</a> is only available in an occasionally buggy \u201cpreview\u201d form and there\u2019s no lossless streaming in a browser. It\u2019s best used with Apple devices. There\u2019s (bafflingly) no way to see a list of your \u201cloved\u201d songs in the mobile app. There\u2019s no free tier or annual option for family plans, either. Plus, if you ever cancel your membership and don\u2019t resubscribe within a few months, Apple will erase your library and playlists, which is a giant bummer, even if there are <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cHBvcnQuYXBwbGUuY29tL2d1aWRlL211c2ljL3NhdmUtYS1jb3B5LW9mLXlvdXItcGxheWxpc3RzLW11czI3Y2Q1MDYwZi9tYWMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjViZjlhMTY2LTFiNDYtNDE1Ni1hZGEzLTI4ZmE0M2ZmYjE1MiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAe8WbsFqAknpB80oy2em6J5LyOYFpeIZ11ZIQ5nszXrk&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com%2Fguide%2Fmusic%2Fsave-a-copy-of-your-playlists-mus27cd5060f%2Fmac\">ways to mitigate</a> the damage.</p><p><strong>Free tier</strong>: No<br /><strong>Individual plan</strong>: $11/month or $109/year<br /><strong>Family plan</strong>: $17/month (up to 6 members)<br /><strong>Voice plan</strong>: $5/month (only usable with Siri)<br /><strong>Student plan</strong>: $6/month</p><h2>Best for music discovery: Spotify</h2><p></p><p><a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL29wZW4uc3BvdGlmeS5jb20vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1YmY5YTE2Ni0xYjQ2LTQxNTYtYWRhMy0yOGZhNDNmZmIxNTIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAadKmlqdc0NR1gPuTSx2g8q0JXmmOhNZKw9GSql_256w&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2F\">Spotify</a> leans much harder on algorithmic suggestions than Apple Music, but having a giant treasure trove of user listening data for so many years has allowed the service to fine-tune its music recommendation engine. This is the main reason to consider it: No service is more accurate at reading the music you like and serving up worthwhile suggestions for other songs you might enjoy. As the most popular music streaming app, it\u2019s also available on a wide array of devices.</p><p>Spotify is particularly impressive at creating playlists. \u201cDiscover Weekly\u201d is famously adept at digging up unheard tracks and artists that align with your tastes. \u201cRelease Radar\u201d is similarly impressive at spotlighting new tracks from artists you follow and those with complementary sounds. A selection of \u201cDaily Mix\u201d playlists blend past likes with deeper cuts from artists in your library and similar songs from ones who aren\u2019t, then sorts them by mood as much as genre. Based on what you\u2019ve been playing, you may wake up to one mix that\u2019s mostly upbeat electro, another marked by soaring indie rock, and another with spacey hip-hop. While its selections can be more hit-or-miss, a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/spotifys-niche-mixes-let-you-generate-personalized-playlists-for-almost-anything-220006705.html\">Niche Mixes\u201d feature</a> lets you search for a mood or genre and have the app generate a relevant playlist. Simply following the algorithm down its rabbit holes makes it easy to find something<em>&nbsp;</em>you can enjoy in just a few taps.</p><p>That said, there are still a ton of human-curated playlists to peruse as well. Regularly updated lists like \u201cRap Caviar,\u201d \u201cNew Music Friday\u201d and \u201cViva Latino\u201d may not be tailored specifically for you, but they\u2019re clearly programmed by knowledgeable people in-tune with current trends. A huge range of less frequently updated playlists based on genres, eras and vibes give the same impression. There\u2019s a human touch here; it\u2019s just not emphasized as much as it is in Apple Music, so which you\u2019ll prefer depends on how willing you are to let an algorithm lead the way.</p><figure><img alt=\"A screenshot of the Spotify app on web browsers.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/21b38b80-14f2-11ee-b1dc-3b89b1266a3d\" style=\"height: 1287px; width: 2560px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>Spotify\u2019s interface is fine but busy. The home tab has rows of suggestions based on your recent listening history. I went through a big <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacht_rock\">yacht rock</a> phase while researching this guide, for example, so my homepage became peppered with playlists like \u201cSoft Rock Classics,\u201d \u201cAll Out 70s,\u201d and \u201cTotally Stress Free.\u201d It wasn\u2019t all stuff like that, but the point is that the service will sensibly morph and adapt as your listening habits change.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/spotify-desktop-app-gets-a-new-look-and-upgraded-library-features-184540624.html\">June 2023 update</a> added a \"Your Library\" sidebar to the left of the home screen, which gives easy access to things you've listened to recently as well as your liked songs and playlists. You can filter this panel to show your saved artists, albums, playlists and podcasts, too. On the right is a \"Now Playing\" view that shows the active song or playlist alongside info like artist bios, tour dates and merch you can buy directly from the app. The latter feels forced, but you can at least disable it with a click if it's distracting. The library view is an efficient way to make use of bigger displays; it puts even more information in your face, but having the music you've already said you like right alongside the algorithm's mountain of recommendations is refreshing. You can even pin specific content so that it always appears at the top of the sidebar.</p><figure><img alt=\"A collage of screenshots of the Spotify app for iOS.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/a4c85090-d3c6-11ed-bfbe-d1d8283e3ba1\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>Search usually works as it should, letting you look up music by title, lyric, artist or even context like \u201cworkout\u201d or \u201cstudying.\u201d Making and sharing a playlist is a breeze, and there's a useful lyrics view for sing-alongs. Artist pages aren\u2019t as comprehensive as Apple Music\u2019s, but they do include a list of upcoming tour dates, with links to tickets from sites like Songkick, AXS and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ticketmaster-live-nation-senate-judiciary-hearing-195504179.html\">Ticketmaster</a>. The search tab has dedicated pages for various genres and vibes, from \u201cJazz\u201d and \u201cR&amp;B\u201d to \u201cIn the car\u201d and \u201cLeague of Legends.\u201d You can start a radio station from any track, too, though this might repeat songs over time.</p><p>Spotify has made a huge push into podcasts and audiobooks in recent years, snapping up exclusive deals with several popular shows along the way (for <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/spotify-joe-rogan-publisher-or-platform-184538877.html\">better or worse</a>). Some may find this convenient, but if you\u2019d like your music app to only push music, Apple Music will feel less cluttered.</p><p>On the mobile app, you can filter the home screen by music, podcasts and audiobooks, but Spotify <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/spotify-debuts-its-tiktok-style-music-discovery-feed-183359654.html\">recently revamped</a> these pages to look more like TikTok-style feeds with huge, autoplaying suggestion cards. This may look slick, but scrolling through an endless feed, one or two suggestions at a time, is not an efficient way to find content. Similarly, the prominently featured <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/spotifys-new-ai-dj-will-talk-you-through-its-recommendations-140052560.html\">AI DJ tool</a> is technically impressive but also has a tendency to make jarring jumps from genre to genre. It speaks to an app that may be putting a little <em>too</em> much emphasis on its algorithmic prowess.

Naturally, this integration also makes YouTube Music the best choice for music videos, which you can swap to with a single tap.</p><p>Because it\u2019s wrangling so much material, however, YouTube Music\u2019s UI can feel scattershot and overwhelming. Scrolling down the home page reveals a hodgepodge of recent listens, liked music, curated and community-generated playlists, \u201csimilar to\u201d suggestions, podcast episodes and clips, radio stations, music videos, algorithmically personalized mixes, new releases and top charts. Searching for an artist may display community playlists and covers underneath more traditional results; it also tends to blend singles with full albums, and it doesn\u2019t display albums in chronological order. Content originally hosted on YouTube won\u2019t integrate with your library as neatly as standard material, either.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/big-youtube-music-web-redesign-cues-play-music/\">June 2023 update</a> to YouTube Music\u2019s web app added a sidebar that gives quick access to liked music, playlists, recent podcast episodes, library tab and a less personalized \u201cExplore\u201d page with trending music, podcasts and music videos. As with Spotify, having your stuff one click away is convenient. The implementation is sloppier, though: You can\u2019t drag and drop a song into a playlist, you can\u2019t sort your liked music view by artist or song title, and all your YouTube Music likes and playlists are mashed together with your likes and playlists from YouTube proper. Anecdotally, at least one playlist on my sidebar has nothing to do with music at all; it\u2019s a video game walkthrough that\u2019s inaccessible through the app anyway.</p><figure><img alt=\"A collage of screenshots depicting the YouTube Music app on iOS.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/25614e00-d3c7-11ed-adcf-48e1c3359acc\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>That said, even if its algorithm-heavy approach is a bit chaotic, YouTube Music\u2019s sheer mass of suggestions makes it good at surfacing new music you might like, and its \u201cDiscover Mix\u201d works nearly as well as Spotify\u2019s Discover Weekly. A few buttons at the top of the app can filter the home page\u2019s suggestions to suit different moods: Relax, Workout, Energize, Commute or Focus. You can start a radio station from any song, though we also found this to regurgitate previously liked tracks more than we\u2019d prefer. You <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/answer/9716522?hl=en\">can upload</a> up to 100,000 of your own music files, too, which\u2019ll be available even if you aren\u2019t a paid subscriber (these won\u2019t affect the service\u2019s recommendations, however). A <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/youtube-music-debuts-samples-a-tiktok-style-feed-for-music-discovery-160007555.html\">new \"Samples\" tab</a>, which displays a personalized video feed of songs you might like, can help with music discovery as well \u2014 though, as with Spotify, filling the whole screen with TikTok-style clips may not be the most efficient use of space.</p><p>The service added <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/youtube-music-adds-podcasts-in-the-us-203332932.html\">podcasts</a> in April 2023, which may be good or bad depending on what you want from your streaming service. Much like Spotify, appending a whole new category of content hasn't made the app\u2019s UI any tidier. While you can access a dedicated podcasts tab from the home screen, its highlighted shows are all over the map, and it often blends podcast clips alongside full episodes. For now, the selection primarily consists of videos uploaded to YouTube that are marked as podcast content, so you won't find all the RSS-based shows you'd find on Spotify or, say, Google Podcasts. But again, if you use YouTube for most of your podcast listening (or viewing) already, the top suggestions here are based on that same viewing history, so it should be a mostly natural transition.</p><p>YouTube Music lacks lossless streaming and tops out at a relatively low 256 Kbps bitrate, so it\u2019s not for audio enthusiasts. There\u2019s no dedicated desktop app, and while there is an ad-supported tier, it stops playback whenever you exit the app on a phone and maxes at a rough 128 Kbps bitrate. All of your playlists are limited to a maximum of 5,000 songs. Google also has a long history of <a href=\"https://killedbygoogle.com/\">killing its own products</a>, including <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-play-music-shutdown-end-of-2020-150006046.html\">this service\u2019s predecessor</a>; we\u2019d understand if that makes you skittish long-term, though the company seems committed to improving YouTube Music today.</p><p><strong>Free tier</strong>: Yes<br /><strong>Individual plan</strong>: $11/month or $110/year; also available as part of YouTube Premium subscription for $14/month or $140/year<br /><strong>Family plan</strong>: $17/month (up to 6 members)<br /><strong>Student plan</strong>: $5.49/month</p><h2>Another good option: Amazon Music Unlimited</h2><p></p><p><a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL211c2ljLmFtYXpvbi5jb20vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1YmY5YTE2Ni0xYjQ2LTQxNTYtYWRhMy0yOGZhNDNmZmIxNTIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAe3buJWXmqn7JpM_2-9-Y9TAsvLSupbS3SlN9o9u3Sos&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.amazon.com%2F\">Amazon Music Unlimited</a> is a strong alternative to Apple Music and Spotify if you want podcasts and lossless streaming within the same app. Like Apple Music, it offers 100+ million songs in CD quality at no extra cost, with a smaller but ever-growing selection of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAC\">FLAC</a> files available in \u201cUltra HD\u201d (24-bit/192kHz).

Most of the major podcast networks are represented, and several shows are presented ad-free.</p><p>If you already subscribe to Amazon Prime, you can get Music Unlimited for less than its rivals, with an individual plan available for $9 a month or $89 a year. It\u2019s not a massive discount, but paying $20 or so less each year isn\u2019t nothing when the broad differences between music streaming services are so marginal. Naturally, Music Unlimited works the smoothest on Amazon\u2019s fleet of Alexa devices as well.</p><figure><img alt=\"A collage of screenshots depicting the Amazon Music Unlimited app on iOS.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/637443f0-d3c7-11ed-99fe-767431a99cc2\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>Music Unlimited\u2019s UI is similar to its peers but has some annoyances. Amazon is more aggressive than Spotify when it comes to pushing podcasts that don\u2019t align with your listening history. Radio stations and algorithmic playlists don\u2019t display what songs are in the queue. Search isn\u2019t as precise as the options above, and you can\u2019t directly search through the saved albums on your library page. Amazon is also less proactive about surfacing new music you might like than Apple or Spotify.

If you\u2019re a music nerd and determined to not give another monthly fee to a tech industry behemoth, it\u2019s a good choice. Its mobile and desktop apps aren\u2019t <em>quite </em>as smooth as those from Apple Music, though, and its highest-resolution tier costs $20 a month. Those high-res tracks are also encoded in MQA, a partly lossy format that isn\u2019t open-source, though the top tier is <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tidal-adds-hi-res-flac-streaming-for-hifi-plus-subscribers-164540463.html\">currently transitioning</a> to FLAC files as well.</p><h3>Qobuz</h3><p><a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=33b112ec-7f97-4b84-a88d-238616aeb732&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=qobuz&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzM2IxMTJlYy03Zjk3LTRiODQtYTg4ZC0yMzg2MTZhZWI3MzIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucW9idXouY29tL3VzLWVuL2Rpc2NvdmVyIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1YmY5YTE2Ni0xYjQ2LTQxNTYtYWRhMy0yOGZhNDNmZmIxNTIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZadWPoFDmcciZkUb4EFWHWSZa9oeWU8RgWd7fHWQq1-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.qobuz.com%2Fus-en%2Fdiscover&amp;uuid=5o75gquoww916jrb27008\">Qobuz</a> is a favorite in audiophile circles, particularly when paired with the <a href=\"https://roonlabs.com/\">Roon</a> music player. Like Tidal, it downplays algorithmic discovery for a more considered, editorial-heavy approach. It offers up to 24-bit/192kHz FLAC streams and includes a digital music store for purchasing high-res downloads of various albums. It\u2019s particularly attentive to classical music. But unless you want to avoid Apple or Amazon, you can get similarly high-quality streaming for a lower price. Some may also find the UI leans too hard on personal curation and requires too much effort to discover new music.</p><h3>Deezer</h3><p><a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=41ab16ce-d6ae-441d-8e82-5d67b557b903&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Deezer&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MWFiMTZjZS1kNmFlLTQ0MWQtOGU4Mi01ZDY3YjU1N2I5MDMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGVlemVyLmNvbS91cy8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjViZjlhMTY2LTFiNDYtNDE1Ni1hZGEzLTI4ZmE0M2ZmYjE1MiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAZtky6J4fDfjRbqQdXXZJ2IZO9asdiruNZ_hNoCuHqQe&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.deezer.com%2Fus%2F\">Deezer</a> has an attractive interface, a competitive library, CD-quality streaming and the ability to <a href=\"https://support.deezer.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115004221605-Upload-MP3s-To-Your-Deezer-Account\">upload your own</a> MP3 files to the service from a desktop.

AI-enhanced algorithms will collect the images into relevant categories, a recent vacation as an example, and create a catchy title to accompany the montage.

In competitive games, the best gaming mouse won\u2019t magically make you unstoppable, but the faster response time and extra inputs should make for a more pleasurable and responsive experience.</p><p>The best gaming mouse for you will ultimately be a matter of preference \u2013 how well its shape fits your hand and how well its feature set suits your particular gaming needs. Over the past several months, though, we set out to find a few options for PC gaming that might fit the bill, be they for FPSes, MMOs or anything in between. After researching dozens of mice, testing around 20, and playing countless hours of <em>Overwatch</em>, <em>CS: GO</em>, <em>Halo Infinite </em>and <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> (among others), here\u2019s what we\u2019ve found, with some general buying advice on top.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h2>What to look for in a gaming mouse</h2><h3>Wired vs. wireless</h3><p>Buying a wireless gaming mouse used to mean sacrificing a certain level of responsiveness, but thankfully, that\u2019s no longer the case. Over the last few years, wireless connectivity has improved to the point where the difference in latency between a good wireless model and a tried-and-true wired gaming mouse is barely perceptible.</p><p>Note, however, that we\u2019re strictly talking about mice that use a 2.4GHz connection (over a USB dongle), not Bluetooth. Many wireless models support both connection options, which is great for travel, but Bluetooth\u2019s latency is generally too high to be reliable for gaming.</p><p>Going wireless still has other trade-offs, too. Battery life is improving all the time, but with their higher performance demands and RGB lighting, most wireless gaming mice usually don't last as long as \"normal\" wireless models. You shouldn\u2019t expect more than a few days of power from a rechargeable gaming mouse you use regularly. Good wireless gaming mice usually come at a much higher cost than their wired counterparts, too.</p><p>That\u2019s not to say the premium is never worth it: Who wants yet <em>another</em> cable on their desk? You may need a wireless model if you hate the feel of \u201ccable drag\u201d or if your gaming PC is located in an awkward spot. Many wireless gaming mice come with a cable you can hook up in a pinch as well. But if price is any sort of concern, a good wired mouse is usually a better value.</p><h3>Comfort and grip types</h3><p>Everyone\u2019s hands are different, so at the end of the day, calling one mouse \u201cmore comfortable\u201d than another is mostly subjective. Ensuring your comfort is the most essential step when buying any mouse, though, so we\u2019ve done our best to consider how each device we tested works with small, average-sized and big hands alike.</p><p>We also considered how each device accommodates the three grip styles most people use while holding a mouse: palm, fingertip and claw. As a refresher, a palm grip is when your whole hand rests on the mouse, with your fingers resting flat on the main buttons. A fingertip grip is when you steer the mouse solely with the tips of your fingers, with your palm not in contact with the device at all. A claw grip is when your palm only touches the back edge of the mouse, with your fingers arched in a claw-like shape toward the buttons.</p><p>In general, most people use a palm grip, which tends to offer the greatest sense of control \u2013 though, depending on the size of your hand, you may need your mouse to be a specific length to use it comfortably. A fingertip grip can allow for more rapid movements, while a claw grip is something of a balance between the two. <a href=\"https://switchandclick.com/mouse-grips/\">Switch and Click</a> has a good breakdown if you\u2019d like a bit more detail, but we\u2019ll note below if a mouse isn\u2019t well-suited for a particular grip style. For what it\u2019s worth, yours truly is a claw gripper most of the time.</p><h3>Build quality and design</h3><p>A good gaming mouse feels sturdy and won\u2019t flex or creak when used strenuously. We valued mice without any overly sharp angles or grooves that could be awkward for most people to hold. And while most gaming mice have plastic exteriors, not all plastic is created equal, so we looked for finishes that were smooth, not too slick and capable of withstanding the sweaty palms that often come with competitive gaming sessions.</p><p>The gaming mouse market is mostly split between two design styles: ergonomic and ambidextrous. Ergonomic gaming mice are almost always made with right-handed users in mind and often feature dedicated thumb rests. Ambidextrous mice are more symmetrical and designed to be used with either hand (though they may not have extra buttons on both sides). Which shape works best for you is largely a matter of personal preference.</p><p>A gaming mouse\u2019s feet, meanwhile, should provide a consistent glide and reduce the friction between your mouse and the surface beneath it as much as possible. For the best performance, look for feet made from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytetrafluoroethylene\">PTFE</a> (aka Teflon). All feet will eventually wear down, but many mice come with spares, and most manufacturers sell replacements if needed.</p><p>As for flashy RGB lighting, it\u2019s a nice bonus, but little more than that. Still, if you\u2019ve already kitted out your setup with RGB, having a mouse with adjustable lighting effects can add to the gaming experience (and more consumer tech could stand to do things for pleasure\u2019s sake). More practically, some mice let you assign custom lighting settings to separate profiles, which can make it easier to see which one you\u2019re currently using.</p><h3>Weight</h3><p>Gaming mice have gotten lighter and lighter in recent years, with some models we tested weighing as little as 45 grams. Your mouse doesn\u2019t <em>need </em>to be that light \u2013 anything under 80g is still fairly low, and it\u2019s not like a 100g mouse feels like an anchor. Regardless, a low weight makes it easier to pull off repeated fast movements, with less inertia. That said, some players still enjoy a little bit of bulk in their gaming mouse (relatively speaking), especially with games that aren\u2019t as reliant on twitchy reactions.</p><p>To reach those lower weights, some manufacturers have released gaming mice with \u201choneycomb\u201d-style designs, which come with several cutouts in the outer shell. These mice can still perform great, but having a bunch of holes that expose the internal circuit board to possible sweat, dust and detritus isn\u2019t the best for long-term durability. We generally avoid recommending models with this design as a result.</p><h3>Switches, buttons and scroll wheel</h3><p>A growing number of gaming mice use optical switches instead of mechanical ones. Since these involve fewer bits making physical contact, they should generally be more durable and less prone to unwanted \u201cdouble-clicks\u201d over time. Mice with mechanical switches still have plenty of merit, but they carry a little more long-term risk in a vacuum.</p><p>Since most people will use their gaming mouse as their <em>mouse</em>-mouse, we valued models whose main buttons have a softer feel when pressed, with enough travel to make inadvertent actuations less frequent. But even this is a matter of preference: You may want lighter buttons if you play games that call for constant clicking. Also, we looked to testing from <a href=\"https://www.rtings.com/mouse/tests/control/latency\">sites like Rtings</a> to ensure each mouse we recommend has a sufficiently low click latency, meaning your clicks will register with minimal lag.</p><p>Beyond the standard click panels, a good gaming mouse should also have programmable buttons for quick macros or shortcuts. For most games, shoot for at least two extra buttons on the thumb side that are easy to reach and difficult to press by accident. Lots of mice have more buttons, which can be a plus, but not if they force you to contort your fingers to avoid hitting them. For MMO mice, having at least 12 side buttons is preferable in order to access as many hotbar commands as possible.</p><p>As for the scroll wheel, it should have distinct, ratcheted \u201csteps\u201d that aren\u2019t too resistant but make it clear when you\u2019ve actually scrolled. Its texture should be grippy, and it shouldn't make a distracting amount of noise when used. The wheel should also be clickable, giving you another input to customize for certain games (e.g., to control the zoom on a sniper rifle).</p><h3>Sensors and performance</h3><p>Some are more proficient than others, but generally speaking, the optical sensors built into most modern gaming mice are more than fast and accurate enough for most people\u2019s needs.</p><p>While shopping for gaming mice, you\u2019ll see a number of terms related to sensor performance. To be clear, a gaming mouse\u2019s responsiveness doesn\u2019t come down to just one spec. But for clarity\u2019s sake, here\u2019s a rundown of the more noteworthy jargon:</p><ul><li><p>DPI, or dots per inch, is a measure of a mouse\u2019s sensitivity. The higher the DPI setting, the more your cursor will move with every inch you move the mouse itself. Many of the best gaming mice advertise extremely high DPIs that top out above 20,000 or 30,000, but that\u2019s largely marketing fluff: Few people play above 3,000, with 800 a common sweet spot. This concept is also referred to as CPI (counts per inch), which <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/DPI-vs-CPI/\">is probably</a> the more accurate term, though DPI is used more often.</p></li><li><p>IPS, or inches per second, refers to the maximum velocity a mouse sensor supports. The higher the IPS, the faster you can move the mouse before it becomes incapable of tracking motions correctly.</p></li><li><p>Acceleration goes with IPS. In this context, it refers to how many Gs a mouse can withstand before it starts to track inaccurately.</p></li><li><p>Polling rate is a measure of how often a mouse tells a computer where it is. In general, the more frequently your mouse reports information to your PC, the more predictable its response time should be. Anything at 500Hz or above is fine for gaming. The current standard, and likely the sweet spot for most, is 1,000Hz.</p></li><li><p>Lift-off distance is the height at which a mouse\u2019s sensor stops tracking the surface below it. Many competitive players like this to be as low as possible in order to avoid unintended cursor movements while repositioning their mouse.</p></li></ul><h3>Software and onboard memory</h3><p>It doesn\u2019t take long to find horror stories about bugs and other niggling issues caused by gaming mouse software, so the ideal app is one that doesn\u2019t force you to use it all the time. It should let you adjust as many of the aspects above as possible, ideally to several distinct profiles. Preferably, you can save your settings directly to the mouse itself, letting you pick your customizations back up on another device without having to redownload any software. All this is most important on Windows, but Mac compatibility is always good to have, too.</p><h3>Warranty and customer support</h3><p>Most major gaming mice brands offer warranties between one and three years. The longer and more extensive a manufacturer\u2019s program is, the better. This is the case with most consumer tech, but we note it here because the gaming mouse market is particularly flush with products from less-than-household names, many of which you may see hyped up on YouTube, Reddit or elsewhere around the web. A bunch of these more obscure mice are genuinely great, but if you ever buy from a more niche brand, it\u2019s worth checking that some level of customer support is in place. We\u2019ve made sure our picks for the best gaming mice aren\u2019t riddled with an abnormal amount of poor user reviews.</p><h2>Best for most: Razer Basilisk V3</h2><p></p><p>Of the gaming mice we tested, the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9SYXplci1CYXNpbGlzay1DdXN0b21pemFibGUtRXJnb25vbWljLUdhbWluZy9kcC9CMDlDMTNQWlg3P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWtwLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwYTNlYjI4ZS00NzMwLTRhZDUtYjQwNi0yNzgzMWE3MGUwY2EifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYNGujdFBAVEMm9foxZdG5eh7mFBxuoug4tm7vcbQRFk&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FRazer-Basilisk-Customizable-Ergonomic-Gaming%2Fdp%2FB09C13PZX7\">Razer Basilisk V3</a> offers the most complete blend of price, performance, build quality and wide-ranging comfort. It\u2019s typically available between $50 and $70, and for that price it provides a sturdy body with a pleasingly textured matte finish and a shape that should be comfortable for each grip type and all but the smallest of hands. It uses durable optical switches, and its main buttons are large, relatively quiet and not fatiguing to press repeatedly.</p><p>The Basilisk V3 has a total of 11 customizable buttons, including two side buttons that are easy to reach but difficult to press by accident. There\u2019s a dedicated \u201csensitivity clutch\u201d on the side as well, which lets you temporarily switch to a lower DPI for more precise aiming (though it's the one button that may be harder for smaller hands to reach without effort). Beneath those buttons is a well-sized thumb rest. The thumb wheel on top is loud and a bit clunky, but it can tilt left and right, and a built-in toggle lets it switch from ratcheted scrolling to a free-spin mode. That\u2019s great for navigating unwieldy documents.</p><p>At roughly 100 grams, the Basilisk V3 is on the heavier side for twitch shooters, but its PTFE feet let it glide with ease, and Razer\u2019s Focus+ sensor helps it track accurately. The weight shouldn\u2019t be a major hindrance unless you really take competitive FPS play seriously. (And if that's the case, see our premium recommendations below.) Either way, the included cable is impressively flexible, and the mouse\u2019s RGB lighting is fun without being garish. Razer\u2019s Synapse software is Windows-only and can be naggy with updates but makes it easy enough to set profiles and adjust DPI, polling rate, macros and RGB effects. You can also save up to five profiles to the mouse itself, though your lighting customizations won\u2019t carry over.&nbsp;</p><p>The Basilisk V3 is an ergonomic mouse designed for right-handed use.

It\u2019s pricey at $150, but its superlight (63g) wireless design and top-notch sensor make it exceptionally responsive. While smaller-handed folks may find it a bit too tall, most should find its gently curved shape to be comfortable over long gaming sessions, regardless of their grip type. Its two side buttons are easy to reach and its body doesn\u2019t creak or flex. The scroll wheel is soft and quiet, while the main buttons feel satisfying but not overly sensitive. It also uses optical switches.</p><p>Battery life is rated at a decent 90 hours per charge, and you can connect an included (and highly flexible) USB-C cable in a pinch.

The DPI switcher is inconveniently located on the bottom of the mouse, and there's no built-in storage compartment for the USB dongle.</p><p>Much of that helps the mouse trim the weight, however, and the whole point of the DeathAdder V3 Pro is to excel at the essentials \u2013 which it does. Razer\u2019s Focus Pro 30K sensor is complete overkill in terms of its maximum specs, but combined with the mouse\u2019s PTFE feet, low click latency and easy-to-flick design, it makes fast movements feel as \u201cone-to-one\u201d as any mouse we tested. If you\u2019re a competitive player who spends most of their time in twitchy FPS games, the DeathAdder V3 Pro should feel tailor-made to your priorities. That\u2019s really the main market here, though; most people don't need to drop $150 on this kind of device.</p><p>While its contours aren\u2019t as pronounced as the Basilisk V3, the DeathAdder V3 Pro is still designed for righties.

Its design is likely too small and flat for palm-grippers with large hands, its scroll wheel feels somewhat mushy, and its rubbery cable isn\u2019t ideal. It uses mechanical switches, too. But the rest of it is smooth, reasonably light (85g) and sturdily built for the money, plus its shape plays well with fingertip or claw grips. It\u2019s also available in snazzy lilac and blue finishes alongside the usual black or white.</p><p>There are two customizable buttons on the right side \u2013 plus a DPI cycle button on top \u2013 but the G203\u2019s design is otherwise ambidextrous. The RGB lighting around the bottom of the device is tasteful, and Logitech\u2019s G Hub software makes it simple enough to tweak settings on both Windows and macOS. There's no onboard memory, however.</p><p>While the Logitech Mercury sensor within the G203 is a few years old and technically lacking compared to most newer alternatives, it\u2019s consistent and responsive enough to yield few complaints. The set of PTFE feet help, too. You wouldn\u2019t go out of your way to get the G203 to win competitive games of <em>Counter-Strike</em>, but it\u2019s perfectly fine for most games.</p><p>If you\u2019d prefer a cheap wireless gaming mouse, the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Mb2dpdGVjaC1MSUdIVFNQRUVELVdpcmVsZXNzLUdhbWluZy1Nb3VzZS9kcC9CMDdDTVM1UTZQP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWtwLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwYTNlYjI4ZS00NzMwLTRhZDUtYjQwNi0yNzgzMWE3MGUwY2EifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYf3W-S4Vvx_poFXUjQgQHIsSwEqIHylIVNzEzR4D4A-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLogitech-LIGHTSPEED-Wireless-Gaming-Mouse%2Fdp%2FB07CMS5Q6P&amp;uuid=V6zPpDeDxHOCxvX326460\">Logitech\u2019s G305 Lightspeed</a> has more or less the same shape and build quality as the G203, but adds a more advanced sensor. Logitech says it can get up to 250 hours of battery life, but it requires a AA battery to work, which in turn pushes its weight to just over 100g.</p><h2>Best for MMOs: Logitech G600</h2><p></p><p>If you want a mouse specifically designed for MMO games, get the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Mb2dpdGVjaC1HYW1pbmctQmFja2xpdC1Qcm9ncmFtbWFibGUtQnV0dG9ucy9kcC9CMDA4NlVLN0lRP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWtwLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwYTNlYjI4ZS00NzMwLTRhZDUtYjQwNi0yNzgzMWE3MGUwY2EifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVz0MS7oumMMOb25NYnt1CQSvgZr_NEfB5Op5dXAAIcn&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLogitech-Gaming-Backlit-Programmable-Buttons%2Fdp%2FB0086UK7IQ\">Logitech G600</a>. It\u2019s ancient, having launched <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2012-06-14-logitech-g600-mouse-targets-button-craving-mmo-gamers.html\">way back in 2012</a>, and as such it uses mechanical switches and a laser sensor (the Avago S9808) that can be less precise than a more modern optical sensor. It\u2019s hefty at 133g, and it has a wide body that\u2019s not ideal for small hands or fingertip grips. Plus, its cable isn\u2019t particularly flexible, and its scroll wheel and main buttons are just <em>OK</em>.</p><p>Hear us out, though. The G600 is far from the only mouse in this style to be on the larger side, and any performance shortcomings it may have will be difficult to notice in an MMO. Outside of faster action games, it tracks fine. For large and average hands, particularly those that use a palm grip, the G600\u2019s sloped shape should be comfortable. Plus, the scroll wheel can tilt left and right.</p><p>The most important thing an MMO mouse can do is let you access several in-game commands with minimal effort. The G600 does that, supplying 12 customizable side buttons that are angled in a way that distinguishes them without constantly forcing you to look down. Few MMO mice make these buttons \u201ceasy to reach,\u201d but the G600 does about as well as one can.</p><p>The mouse\u2019s killer feature, however, is a third click button, which sits under your ring finger and brings up an entire second set of commands when pressed. This means you can access up to <em>24</em> different inputs with just one hand, which is a godsend in MMOs that ask you to juggle multiple hotbars\u2019 worth of commands. Being able to get through your \u201crotations\u201d in a game like <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> without having to contort your fingers around the keyboard is hugely convenient. This feature isn\u2019t exclusive to the G600, but it\u2019s not commonplace either. Best of all, this mouse is affordable, typically retailing around $35. There are certainly <em>nicer</em> MMO mice available, but the G600\u2019s functionality is enough to make it the best value in its market.</p><h2>Other honorable mentions</h2><figure><img alt=\"A white gaming mouse called the Ninjutso Sora rested on top of a black mouse pad on a desk.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/0afb9330-a984-11ed-8fc1-932404a51991\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>If you don\u2019t like the Razer aesthetic, <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Mb2dpdGVjaC1TVVBFUkxJR0hULVVsdHJhLUxpZ2h0d2VpZ2h0LVByb2dyYW1tYWJsZS1Db21wYXRpYmxlL2RwL0IwODdMWENURko_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8ta3AtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjBhM2ViMjhlLTQ3MzAtNGFkNS1iNDA2LTI3ODMxYTcwZTBjYSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAUxRbFoQnyfwqqGQ3fEX1XnUs1PwuV1-2lnU54hYQOw0&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLogitech-SUPERLIGHT-Ultra-Lightweight-Programmable-Compatible%2Fdp%2FB087LXCTFJ&amp;uuid=eli55SVFd8FYAgsQ21460\">Logitech\u2019s G Pro X Superlight</a> is a close runner-up to the DeathAdder V3 Pro whose <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/logitech-g-pro-x-superlight-mouse-irl-140037783.html\">praises we\u2019ve sung</a> in the past.

YouTube Music is the latest. Today, the app will get a vertical video feed called Samples that YouTube describes as a one-tap way to quickly sample and find new music.&nbsp;</p><p>Samples lives in a new tab at the bottom of the app, alongside the home feed, your library and the explore section. Tapping Samples automatically starts a short vertical video clip of a song that YouTube Music thinks you'll like. Naturally, it's pulling songs based on your taste profile, with an emphasis on artists that you like, and related ones who you might not have heard before.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The app already has multiple playlists that are tuned to your listening habits, including a Supermix that pulls songs and artists together across all your listening habits. There's also a Discover playlist that, naturally, focuses on things you're not familiar with but might enjoy based on your history. YouTube Music product manager Gregor Dodson told Engadget that the algorithm for the Samples feed is a little different from both of those \u2014 it's trying to site in between the two playlists, highlighting artists that you may be familiar with but pulling clips you haven't watched before.</p><p>The clips you'll see in Samples are only 30 seconds long, but that's about enough to give you a sense of the song. If it's not what you're looking for, just swipe up and you'll jump to another song, and you can do this as much as you want. Spotify <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/spotify-debuts-its-tiktok-style-music-discovery-feed-183359654.html\">added its own vertical video feed</a> recently, but that's less for discovery and more to offer a way to quickly scroll through previews of songs in its playlists. But with both Spotify and YouTube Music implementing such a new, it seems likely that we'll see more apps do the same soon.</p><p>I got to try Samples for a few days before it launched, and the thing I found most interesting was to use it as a jumping off point for a longer listening session, something Dodson confirmed was by design. &quot;Short form video [and] the infinite scroll have really interesting applications in music discovery,&quot; he said. &quot;It's a simple way to discover new music, but it's not the end of the journey \u2014 it's just the start of finding a new artist or song.&quot;&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt=\"YouTube Music Samples\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/2143b520-3b72-11ee-af7f-eb1978592b07\" style=\"height: 1292px; width: 1634px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">YouTube</div></figure><p>To that end, the Samples video view is overlaid with a number of controls. From any Sample, you can tap the thumbs-up to save the song to your &quot;liked songs&quot; playlist. You can also save the song to any playlist you've created. Between these two options, it's pretty easy to quickly scan through Samples and save a bunch of songs to check out further. And if you hear something you want to immediately play in full, just tap the big old play button in the corner of the screen.</p><p>Since this is YouTube we're talking about, there's also a &quot;Shorts&quot; button that pops you into the main YouTube app. It'll show you other Shorts clips created with the audio you picked and let you jump into making your own clip with the song. Finally, the share button does just what you'd think \u2014 you get a link that can drop into a host of other apps like Messages, Reddit, Facebook and whatever else you might have installed.&nbsp;</p><p>In the overflow menu, you can find a lot of other options, like starting a continuous radio station from the song, jumping into the artist's page to find more music, saving the track to your library and so forth. I with the &quot;start radio&quot; button was featured more prominently in the Samples video, because I found that to be a great way to jump into a auto-generated set of tunes with the same vibe as the Sample that initially caught my eye (and ear).&nbsp;</p><p>My main issue with Samples is one of UI. Specifically, it's not always clear where exactly you'll end up in the app when you switch views. Tapping the Samples tab starts the video scroll, and to exit it you can tap one of the other bottom navigation tabs; tapping the &quot;play&quot; button opens up the familiar YouTube Music player controls. Finally, swiping back down to hide the player interface returns you to Samples. Seems pretty clear. But at one point, I had hit the play button to hear a song and then rotated my phone to landscape to see the video in full screen. When the next song started, I rotated my phone back to landscape, and the app threw me immediately back into the Samples view, with the clip of the song I had already heard still playing.</p><p>Another time, I started playing a song, and the hit the toggle at the top of the Now Playing screen to switch the video off and just hear the song. I listened to a few more songs from the auto-generated station of similar music, and then swiped down to hide the Now Playing UI and browse around the app. I was again tossed back into the Samples view. That does make some logical sense, as that's where the whole listening experience started. But I'm to used to being able to hide the Now Playing screen and browse around the app while still playing music that it was a bit jarring. That said, I could then hit the &quot;Home&quot; tab at the bottom and resume what I was playing. It works, but the addition of Samples does change a few of the app's expected behaviors.</p><p>These quibbles aside, Samples seems like a pretty handy addition to the YouTube Music app. In the few days I had to test it, it consistently served up music from artists I liked, and the song selections were indeed things I was usually less familiar with. The video clip aspect of it doesn't really matter to me, but given how many artists are making excellent videos these days, it's fun to remember that these visuals are worth checking out sometimes. (Thanks, YouTube Music, for surfacing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJ9-xN6dCW4\">the wild video for &quot;I Know the End&quot; by Phoebe Bridgers</a>.) More importantly, it did work well as a jumping-off point for digging into some artists I had forgotten about or finding a tune to set the mood for a playlist or station.</p><p>YouTube says that the Samples feature is rolling out globally starting today for both Android and iOS users. As with most new features, it might not hit your app immediately, so you might need to be a little patient.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/youtube-music-debuts-samples-a-tiktok-style-feed-for-music-discovery-160007555.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/youtube-music-debuts-samples-a-tiktok-style-feed-for-music-discovery-160007555.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-08-15T16:00:07+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Google's latest AI trick is summarizing long web pages", "description": "<p>Google is testing a new capability for its generative AI in search that will make it a more veritable rival to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-new-bing-edge-ai-copilot-hands-on-demo-test-chatgpt-openai-213332455.html\">Microsoft's AI Copilot in Edge</a>.

The tech giant positions it as a tool you can use to more easily digest complex topics that might require extensive research. However, the tool will not be able to provide key points for paywalled articles, only for some web pages that you can view free of charge.&nbsp;</p><p>Whenever Google's AI can generate key points for the page you're visiting, you'll see an option that says &quot;Get AI-generated key points&quot; at the bottom of the screen on mobile or in the sidebar on desktop.

There's also an &quot;Explore on page&quot; section that shows the questions the article answers. At the moment, the feature is only available within the Google app on Android and iOS, but it is coming to Chrome on desktop in the next few days. The tool is automatically switched on if you've already opted in to try out SGE, but you can also switch it on as a standalone experiment in <a href=\"https://labs.google.com/\">Search Labs</a>.

It could provide a quick way for you to understand its AI's answers to your questions without having to do a deep-dive for all the concepts you aren't familiar with.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, if you're a programmer who's not opposed to using AI tools for coding, Google has also added new capabilities to SGE that could help you better understand and debug the codes it generates.

As our Deputy Editor Cherlynn Low notes in her review, the big upgrade this year is a roomier cover display; at 3.4 inches, it's much more useful for replying to texts, checking notifications, using apps, and yes, taking selfies without having to physically unfold the phone. You have to jump through a <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-good-lock-run-any-app-galaxy-z-flip-5-cover-screen/\">few hoops</a> to get any app to work in full on the outer display, but once you do, it becomes a bit more versatile.&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond that, there's a new hinge that lets the whole thing fold flat when closed. The device is still capable as a \"normal\" phone, with a flagship-level Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor and a vibrant 6.7-inch OLED interior display. Samsung also promises four years of OS updates and five years of security patches, which is more extensive than many Android manufacturers.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 5 is still a foldable, so you'll have to take more care than usual when handling it. Its IPX8 water-resistance rating means it can survive a brief dunking, but it may be more susceptible to damage from dust or sand. Its camera performance isn't as impressive as the best standard phones in its price range, particularly in low-light settings, and its battery life is only so-so by comparison. There's a visible crease on the interior display as well. Nevertheless, this is the best flip-style foldable you can buy, and this deal makes it a little more affordable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter and </em><a href=\"https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src\"><em>subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em> for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-is-100-off-right-now-154530207.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-is-100-off-right-now-154530207.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-08-15T15:45:30+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Xbox adopts an eight-strike suspension policy", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/microsoft/\"><ins>Microsoft</ins></a> is attempting to be more transparent about how it enforces the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/xbox/\"><ins>Xbox</ins></a> community standards.

The once-niche way to protect your online activity took off, in part, due to massive marketing budgets and influencer collaborations convincing consumers that a VPN's functionality or privacy features could solve all their security woes. But deciding the best option for your browsing needs requires digging through claims of attributes that aren\u2019t always totally accurate. That has made it harder to figure out which VPN service provider to subscribe to, or if you really need to use one at all. We tested out nine of the best VPN services available now to help you choose the right one for your needs.</p><h2>What you should know about VPNs</h2><p>VPNs are not a one-size-fits-all security solution. Instead, they\u2019re just one part of keeping your data private and secure. Roya Ensafi, assistant professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Michigan, told Engadget that VPNs don\u2019t protect against common threats like phishing attacks, nor do they protect your data from being stolen. But they do come in handy for online privacy when you\u2019re connecting to an untrusted network somewhere public because they tunnel and encrypt your traffic to the next hop.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>In other words, secure VPNs work by masking your IP address and the identity of your computer or mobile device on the network and creating an encrypted \"tunnel\" that prevents your internet service provider (ISP) from accessing data about your browsing history. Even then, much of the data or information is stored with the VPN provider instead of your ISP, which means that using a poorly designed or unprotected network can still undermine your security.</p><p>That means sweeping claims that seem promising, like military-grade encryption or total digital invisibility, may not be totally accurate. Instead, Yael Grauer, program manager of Consumer Reports\u2019 online security guide, recommends looking for security features like open-source software with reproducible builds, up-to-date support for industry-standard protocols like WireGuard, IPsec or PPTP and the ability to defend against attack vectors like brute force.</p><h2>Who are VPNs really for?</h2><p>Before considering a VPN, make sure your online security is up to date in other ways. That means complex passwords, multifactor authentication methods and locking down your data sharing preferences. Even then, you probably don\u2019t need to be using a VPN all the time.</p><p>\u201cIf you're just worried about somebody sitting there passively and looking at your data then a VPN is great,\u201d Jed Crandall, an associate professor at Arizona State University, told Engadget.</p><p>If you use public WiFi networks a lot, like while working at a coffee shop, then VPN usage can help give you private internet access. They\u2019re also helpful for hiding information from other people on your ISP if you don\u2019t want members of your household to know what you\u2019re up to online.</p><p>Geoblocking has also become a popular use case as it helps you reach services in other parts of the world. For example, you can access shows that are only available on streaming services, like Netflix, Hulu or Amazon Prime, in other countries, or play online games with people located all over the globe.</p><h2>Are VPNs worth it?</h2><p>Whether or not VPNs are worth it depends how often you could use it for the above use cases. If you travel a lot and rely on public WiFi or hotspots, are looking to browse outside of your home country or want to keep your traffic hidden from your ISP, then investing in a VPN will be useful. But, keep in mind that even the best VPN services often slow down your internet connection speed, so they may not be ideal all the time.</p><p>We recommend not relying on a VPN connection as your main cybersecurity tool. VPN use can provide a false sense of security, leaving you vulnerable to attack. Plus, if you choose just any VPN, it may not be as secure as just relying on your ISP. That\u2019s because the VPN could be based in a country with weaker data privacy regulation, obligated to hand information over to law enforcement or linked to weak user data protection policies.</p><p>For VPN users working in professions like activism or journalism that want to really strengthen their internet security, options like the Tor browser may be a worthwhile alternative, according to Crandall. Tor is free, and while it's less user-friendly, it\u2019s built for anonymity and privacy.</p><h2>How we tested</h2><p>To test the security specs of different VPNs and name our top picks, we relied on pre-existing academic work through <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/vpn-services/mullvad-ivpn-mozilla-vpn-top-consumer-reports-vpn-testing-a9588707317/\">Consumer Reports</a>, <a href=\"https://vpnalyzer.org/\">VPNalyzer</a> and other sources. We referenced privacy policies, transparency reports and security audits made available to the public. We also considered past security incidents like data breaches.</p><p>We looked at price, usage limits, effects on internet speed, possible use cases, ease of use, general functionality and additional \u201cextra\u201d VPN features like multihop. The VPNs were tested across iOS, Android and Mac devices so we could see the state of the mobile apps across various platforms (Windows devices are also supported in most cases). We used the \u201cquick connect\u201d feature on the VPNs to connect to the \u201cfastest\u201d provider available when testing internet speed, access to IP address data and DNS and WebRTC leaks or when a fault in the encrypted tunnel reveals requests to an ISP.</p><p>Otherwise, we conducted a test of geoblocking content by accessing Canada-exclusive Netflix releases, a streaming test by watching a news livestream on YouTube via a Hong Kong-based VPN and a gaming test by playing on servers in the United Kingdom. By performing these tests at the same time, it also allowed us to test claims about simultaneous device use.</p><h3>VPNs we tested:</h3><ul><li><p><a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-100230748-14437997\">ExpressVPN</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c52a3d27-2d9a-44d8-8cf2-6f6387b122a0&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=NordVPN&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjNTJhM2QyNy0yZDlhLTQ0ZDgtOGNmMi02ZjYzODdiMTIyYTAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9ub3JkdnBuLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImFkOTE1MDhiLWJiZTEtNDRlOC1hNzE2LTAyNzI0Y2JjYTNhYyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQXft9OD6rLKuE3EeJnnHBCc242IE-XnNcv8hGIe48D_&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fnordvpn.com%2F\">NordVPN</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=6119f7ca-bf13-40ba-b3f6-2a335a8890f6&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=surfshark&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2MTE5ZjdjYS1iZjEzLTQwYmEtYjNmNi0yYTMzNWE4ODkwZjYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9zdXJmc2hhcmsuY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYWQ5MTUwOGItYmJlMS00NGU4LWE3MTYtMDI3MjRjYmNhM2FjIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAew67IgxBRqcZ6LIo58dh_RnSNSjrwxb8YksKDxdubiq&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsurfshark.com%2Fdeals\">Surfshark</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-100230748-13792482\">Proton VPN</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1c695770-3d23-4adf-9f4f-c595e9124f3b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=TunnelBear&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIxYzY5NTc3MC0zZDIzLTRhZGYtOWY0Zi1jNTk1ZTkxMjRmM2IiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudHVubmVsYmVhci5jb20vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhZDkxNTA4Yi1iYmUxLTQ0ZTgtYTcxNi0wMjcyNGNiY2EzYWMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWmLU8w1OqAlasUVR9oUII9dIM0UOkRgiKVV2zB9ShaL&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tunnelbear.com%2F\">TunnelBear</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=611316b6-01c7-4271-8c69-1aaf6d7108ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Bitdefender&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2MTEzMTZiNi0wMWM3LTQyNzEtOGM2OS0xYWFmNmQ3MTA4YWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYml0ZGVmZW5kZXIuY29tL3NvbHV0aW9ucy92cG4uaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYWQ5MTUwOGItYmJlMS00NGU4LWE3MTYtMDI3MjRjYmNhM2FjIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAf2reOHxw0jaFi1jiRPDJtR3Y5YHJSajvTuMNHmB-SgL&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitdefender.com%2Fsolutions%2Fvpn.html\">Bitdefender VPN</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9fd99815-3196-46cf-9b6f-707caf84c282&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CyberGhost&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5ZmQ5OTgxNS0zMTk2LTQ2Y2YtOWI2Zi03MDdjYWY4NGMyODIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY3liZXJnaG9zdHZwbi5jb20vZW5fVVMvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhZDkxNTA4Yi1iYmUxLTQ0ZTgtYTcxNi0wMjcyNGNiY2EzYWMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAbdpm0QDvyQD5IH5XMG0vgx732Wi0D5g6CgSmbUNZ9ln&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyberghostvpn.com%2Fen_US%2F\">CyberGhost</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://windscribe.com/features/use-for-free\">Windscribe</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2F0bGFzdnBuLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImFkOTE1MDhiLWJiZTEtNDRlOC1hNzE2LTAyNzI0Y2JjYTNhYyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAASeETI9dS6ZPxbToUph0S5NWTograPEVPjPRVP931t6V&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fatlasvpn.com%2F\">Atlas VPN</a></p></li></ul><h2>Best VPN overall: ProtonVPN</h2><p></p><p>The VPNs we tried out ranked pretty consistently across all of our tests, but <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=06a20697-4135-4e83-a421-f326eee937ed&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=ProtonVPN&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIwNmEyMDY5Ny00MTM1LTRlODMtYTQyMS1mMzI2ZWVlOTM3ZWQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9wcm90b252cG4uY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYWQ5MTUwOGItYmJlMS00NGU4LWE3MTYtMDI3MjRjYmNhM2FjIn0&amp;signature=AQAAASPTOHDxtcJbE-t49l7sjJMvW4wl1inFzyOcIJYRUXYC&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fprotonvpn.com%2F\">ProtonVPN</a> stood out as a strong option because of its overall security and usability. The Proton Technologies suite of services includes mail, calendar, drive and a VPN known for its end-to-end encryption. This makes it a strong contender for overall security, but its VPN specifically came across as a well-rounded independent service.</p><p>ProtonVPN\u2019s no-logs policy has passed audits, and the company has proven not to comply with law enforcement requests. Because it is based in Switzerland, there are no forced logging obligations, according to the company. Plus, it\u2019s based on an open-source framework, and has an official vulnerability disclosure program along with clear definitions on what it does with personal information.</p><p>While ProtonVPN offers a free version, it\u2019s limited compared to other options, with access to server networks in just three countries. Its paid version, starting at about $5.39 per month, includes access to VPN server locations in more than 65 countries on 10 devices at a time. For dedicated Proton Technologies users, they can pay closer to $8.63 for a monthly plan to access the entire suite.</p><p>ProtonVPN passed our geoblock, streaming and gaming tests with only a very small toll on connection speeds. It also comes with malware-, ad- and tracker-blocking as an additional service, plus it has a kill switch feature on macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS and the latest version of Android. It\u2019s available on most major operating systems, routers, TV services and more including Firefox, Linux and Android TV.</p><h2>Best free VPN: Windscribe</h2><p></p><p>By signing up for <a href=\"https://windscribe.com/features/use-for-free\">Windscribe's free plan</a> with your email, users can access 10GB per month of data, unlimited connections and access to more than 10 countries. We selected it as the best free VPN because of its high security and wide range of server locations compared to other free VPNs. It has over 500 servers in over 60 countries, according to the company, and can be configured to routers, smart TVs and more on top of the usual operating systems.</p><p>Windscribe doesn\u2019t have a recent independent security audit, but it does publish <a href=\"https://windscribe.com/transparency\">a transparency report</a> showing that it has complied with zero requests for its data, runs a vulnerability disclosure program encouraging researchers to report flaws and offers multiple protocols for users to connect with.</p><p>On top of that, it\u2019s easy to use. The set up is intuitive and it passed our geoblock, streaming and gaming tests. The paid version costs $5.75 to $9 each month, depending on the plan you choose, and includes unlimited data, access to all servers and an ad/tracker/malware blocker. Or, for $1 per location per month, users can build a plan tailored to the VPNs they want to access.</p><h2>Best for streaming services, frequent travel and gaming: ExpressVPN</h2><p></p><p>We picked the best VPN service for travel, gaming and streaming based on which one had access to the most locations with high speed connections and no lag. <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4255ebf1-6185-403e-9be2-91ab47ad1ac3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=ExpressVPN&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MjU1ZWJmMS02MTg1LTQwM2UtOWJlMi05MWFiNDdhZDFhYzMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXhwcmVzc3Zwbi5jb20vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhZDkxNTA4Yi1iYmUxLTQ0ZTgtYTcxNi0wMjcyNGNiY2EzYWMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfTSiO2r428NJBCpZe3eLV5R1owvIj5yByLJP3rxwv1h&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.expressvpn.com%2F\">ExpressVPN</a> met all those criteria and was one of the fastest VPNs we tried.</p><p>An internet speed test measured faster upload and download speed compared to using no VPN, practically unheard of compared to the other VPNs tested.

Plus, Network Lock is its kill switch feature, which keeps your data safe even if you lose connection to the VPN. Subscription costs range from $8.32 to $12.95 per month depending on the term of the plan, and include a password manager.</p><p>With ExpressVPN, users can connect to up to five devices at once, which is on the lower side compared to other services. That said, it works on a bunch of devices from smart TVs to game consoles, unlike some other services that lack support beyond the usual suspects like smartphones and laptops.</p><h2>Best cross-platform accessibility: CyberGhost</h2><p></p><p>Because several of the best VPN services connect to routers, cross-platform accessibility isn\u2019t always necessary. By connecting a VPN to your home router, you can actually connect to unlimited devices in your household, as long as they all access the internet through that router.</p><p>But if you use VPNs on the go, and across several devices, being able to connect to a wide range of platforms will be indispensable. <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9fd99815-3196-46cf-9b6f-707caf84c282&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CyberGhost&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5ZmQ5OTgxNS0zMTk2LTQ2Y2YtOWI2Zi03MDdjYWY4NGMyODIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY3liZXJnaG9zdHZwbi5jb20vZW5fVVMvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhZDkxNTA4Yi1iYmUxLTQ0ZTgtYTcxNi0wMjcyNGNiY2EzYWMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAbdpm0QDvyQD5IH5XMG0vgx732Wi0D5g6CgSmbUNZ9ln&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyberghostvpn.com%2Fen_US%2F\">CyberGhost</a> offers simultaneous connectivity on up to seven devices for $2.11 to $12.99 per month depending on subscription term.

And you get that convenience without a significant increase in price: Surfshark subscriptions cost about $2.49 to $12.95 for a monthly subscription, and the company recently conducted its <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/surfshark-passes-first-independent-no-logs-audit/\">first independent audit</a>.</p><p>We ran into some trouble connecting to Surfshark\u2019s WireGuard protocol, but tested on an IKEv2 protocol instead. The VPN speed was a bit slow and struggled to connect for our geoblock test at first, but ultimately passed. What makes it different from other VPNs with unlimited connection options is that it has access to a larger number of servers and is available on more types of devices.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>What are some things VPNs are used for?</h3><p>VPNs are traditionally used to protect your internet traffic. If you\u2019re connected to an untrusted network like public WiFi in a cafe, using a VPN hides what you do from the internet service provider. Then, the owner of the WiFi or hackers trying to get into the system can\u2019t see the identity of your computer or your browsing history.</p><p>A common non-textbook use case for VPNs has been accessing geographically restricted content. VPNs can mask your location, so even if you\u2019re based in the United States, they can make it appear as if you\u2019re browsing abroad. This is especially useful for streaming content that\u2019s often limited to certain countries, like if you want to watch Canadian Netflix from the US.</p><h3>What information does a VPN hide?</h3><p>A VPN doesn\u2019t hide all of your data. It only hides information like your IP address, location and browser history. A common misconception is that VPNs can make you totally invisible online. But keep in mind that the VPN provider often still has access to all of this information, so it doesn\u2019t grant you total anonymity. You\u2019re also still vulnerable to phishing attacks, hacking and other cyberthreats that you should be mindful of by implementing strong passwords and multi-factor authentication.</p><h3>Are VPNs safe?</h3><p>Generally, yes. VPNs are a safe and reliable way to encrypt and protect your internet data. But like most online services, the safety specifics vary from provider to provider. You can use resources like third-party audits, <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/vpn-services/mullvad-ivpn-mozilla-vpn-top-consumer-reports-vpn-testing-a9588707317/\">Consumer Reports reviews</a>, transparency reports and privacy policies to understand the specifics of your chosen provider.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-vpn-130004396.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-vpn-130004396.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-08-15T13:16:07+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Comcast debuts Storm-Ready WiFi device ahead of hurricane season", "description": "<p>A storm often evokes a desire to feel safe inside your home and able to communicate with loved ones or emergency personnel \u2014 yet, electric and landline connections are often the first systems to go down.

You can play \u201chi-res\u201d audio files on most phones and PCs, you just might not be getting the full experience. If your device\u2019s audio interface tops out at 44.1 or 48kHz (which is fairly common and covers the vast majority of music online) then that\u2019s the experience you\u2019ll get. If you want to enjoy music at a higher sample rate and bit-depth (aka resolution), you\u2019ll need an interface that supports it and wired headphones.</p><p>It\u2019s worth pointing out that \u201clossless\u201d and \u201chi-res\u201d are related terms, but not the same thing and will vary from service to service. Apple uses <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Lossless\">ALAC encoding</a> which <em>is </em>compressed, but without \u201closs\u201d to the quality (unlike the ubiquitous .aac or .mp3 file formats). CDs were generally mastered to at least 16-bit / 44.1kHz which is the benchmark that Apple is using for its definition of lossless. In audio circles, a general consensus is that hi-res is anything with a sample rate <em>above</em> 44.1kHz. Increasingly, though, the term is being used for anything 96kHz and above.</p><p>This, of course, isn\u2019t only about Apple\u2019s new streaming formats. External DACs and audio interfaces are a great way to get the best sound and upgrade your listening experience generally. Especially if you want to get into the world of more exotic (read: pricey) headphones, as they often even require a DAC to provide enough clean digital signal to drive them. For audiophile headphones, a phone or laptop\u2019s internal sound chip often doesn\u2019t have the oomph needed to deliver a hi-fi experience.</p><h3>Okay, but can\u2019t I just use the headphone adapter for my phone?</h3><p>No. Well, yes, but see above. A Lightning or USB-C to 3.5mm headphone adapter often <em>is</em> an audio interface and most of the ones you\u2019re buying for $7 (or that come free in the box) do not support hi-res audio beyond 48kHz / 24-bit. Android is a little more complicated, as some adapters are \u201cpassive\u201d and really just connect you to the phone\u2019s internal DAC like old school headphones. Others (active ones) have a DAC built-in and good luck finding out what your specific phone and the in-box adapter delivers. (Hint: connect it to a PC and see if it comes up as an audio interface. You might find some details there if it does).</p><h2>What is a \u201cDAC,\u201d though?</h2><figure><img alt=\"Best DACs for Apple Music Lossless in 2021.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/0d3d0720-c9e1-11eb-bff3-69fe89e400be\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Billy Steele / Engadget</div></figure><p>A digital-to-analog converter takes the digital (D) music from your phone or computer and converts (C) it into analog (A) sound you can hear. All phones and PCs have them, but since handsets moved to USB-C, Lightning or Bluetooth for music, the task of converting that signal was generally outsourced to either your adapter or your wireless headphones.</p><p>DACs can be used with phones, laptops and desktops but tend to be much simpler than a regular external audio interface. One basic distinction is that DACs are usually for listening only whereas an audio interface might have ports to plug in microphones and instruments (but an external audio interface is also technically a DAC).</p><p>The benefit of DACs is that they tend to be lightweight, making them more suitable for mobile use, although it still gets a little tricky with the iPhone as you still might need to add another dongle to make it play nice with Lightning. Also, not all DACs support all the higher audio resolutions. Most DACs require external power or an onboard battery, though some can use the power from whatever you plug them into \u2014 in which case expect a hit to your battery life. Below are some of our picks for a variety of scenarios.</p><h2>Best for Android users looking for a simple, affordable option: Ugreen USB-C to 3.5mm headphone adapter</h2><p></p><p>Okay, you were expecting serious outboard gear and we start by showing you a basic adapter? Yes, because <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDgyV0c1VlRLP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWlvLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3MmE4OWIwYS0wM2Q0LTRkMjctOTdhNi03ZmI4YTg1YjI1NDMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAcHj8mwWLcaFRqO1pWFQ54fJF7kdWsAm9fcLf7ptNwtb&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB082WG5VTK\">this one</a> supports 96kHz audio (24-bit) and is about as straightforward as you can get. Simply plug into your USB-C device (or USB-A with an\u2026 adapter), connect your headphones and away you go. There are no buttons, no controls, nothing to charge.</p><p>While this dongle doesn\u2019t support 192kHz, the move up to 96kHz is still firmly in the \u201chi-res\u201d audio category, and its super low profile and ease of use make it a great option for those that want an audio quality bump without going full-bore external DAC.</p><p>Of course, this budget DAC is best suited to devices with a USB-C port such as the iPad Pro, MacBook or most Android phones. As noted earlier, it\u2019s possible your Android already supports hi-res audio and a simple passive dongle is all you need, but given the price and quality of this one, at least you know what you\u2019re getting, as the specific details of audio support for every Android phone out there are often hard to find.</p><p>The downside is that this adapter won\u2019t do much to help drive higher impedance headphones, so it\u2019s less suited to audiophiles who really need more power to drive their favorite cans. I used this on both an Android phone and an iMac and it worked just fine, although with Apple computers you need to head to the Audio/MIDI settings first to make sure you\u2019re getting the highest quality available.</p><h2>Best for streamlined desktop use with high-end headphones: Apogee Groove</h2><p></p><p>Apogee gear is usually found in the studio.

We\u2019re stepping up the sound quality here with support for 192 kHz (24-bit), which will cover everything from Apple\u2019s new lossless service.</p><p>Connecting your iPhone to the Groove is a little more complicated. It works just fine, but you\u2019ll need something like the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BcHBsZS1MaWdodG5pbmctVVNCMy1DYW1lcmEtQWRhcHRlci9kcC9CMDFGN0tKRElNP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWlvLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3MmE4OWIwYS0wM2Q0LTRkMjctOTdhNi03ZmI4YTg1YjI1NDMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZi7j3TMFgAVeyVuZ_x_pj57eHNV_q4VFQaJK8OWf_2K&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-Lightning-USB3-Camera-Adapter%2Fdp%2FB01F7KJDIM\">Apple Camera kit</a>, as it needs external power. In short, it gets a bit \u201cdongly\u201d but it works if you want something for your desktop first, that can do double duty on iPhone. Android support is a little hit and miss, though you would still need a way to feed it power while in use.</p><p>Once you\u2019re set up, just plug in your headphones and you\u2019re away. The rubberized base of the Groove stops it from shifting around on your desk, and the large buttons make controlling volume a breeze, with LED feedback to show you volume levels.</p><p>Audio sounds dynamic, with a generous bump in gain over whatever you\u2019re plugging it into likely offers. The frequency response is flat meaning you get out exactly what you put in audio-wise, making this a great choice if the connectivity (and price) matches your specific use case.</p><h2>Best for power and portability: AudioQuest Dragonfly Cobalt</h2><p></p><p>Bar the Ugreen dongle, the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BdWRpb1F1ZXN0LURyYWdvbmZseS1VU0ItSGVhZHBob25lLUFtcGxpZmllci9kcC9CMDdUM0hTRDlaP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWlvLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3MmE4OWIwYS0wM2Q0LTRkMjctOTdhNi03ZmI4YTg1YjI1NDMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAeG4UbuZMuN3ygYyPi8C1jZCMruqZNw8YTD7CcL0YKX0&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAudioQuest-Dragonfly-USB-Headphone-Amplifier%2Fdp%2FB07T3HSD9Z\">Dragonfly</a> is easily the smallest, most portable device on this list. And better yet, it almost certainly works with your phone, PC or laptop and won\u2019t require a dedicated power supply (despite the lack of a built-in battery). You\u2019ll still need an adapter for phones (USB-A to Lightning or USB-A to USB-C for Android) but otherwise, it\u2019s plug and play. There\u2019s no volume control, just one 3.5mm headphone jack and a color-changing LED (to tell you what sample rate the track you\u2019re listening to is using).</p><p>At $300, it\u2019s a pricey proposition, but the cable spaghetti of some devices or the sheer heft of others, means the Dragonfly\u2019s small footprint and rugged simplicity make it refreshingly discreet and simple. AudioQuest also offers two cheaper models, <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BdWRpb1F1ZXN0LURyYWdvbkZseS1CbGFjay1QcmVhbXAtSGVhZHBob25lL2RwL0IwMURQNUpISEk_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8taW8tMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjcyYTg5YjBhLTAzZDQtNGQyNy05N2E2LTdmYjhhODViMjU0MyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATb1meda6ExmxPGOZBcMTOdJK1eFxlCjgidyPHq6H5bo&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAudioQuest-DragonFly-Black-Preamp-Headphone%2Fdp%2FB01DP5JHHI\">starting at $100</a> that are likely more than good enough for most people.</p><p>Don\u2019t let the Dragonfly\u2019s size and lack of controls fool you, the Cobalt throws out some serious, high quality sound. According to AudioQuest, the maximum resolution has been intentionally limited to 96kHz for the \u201coptimal\u201d experience, and that\u2019s plenty enough to cover what you\u2019ll get from most music services.</p><p>The output from the in-built headphone amp will make your phone\u2019s audio feel positively wimpy by comparison, and the powerful internal sound processing chip delivers crystal clear audio with a wide soundstage across a range of genres and formats.</p><p>One extra trick up the Dragonfly\u2019s sleeve is native support for Master Quality Authenticated (MQA) files. This is the preferred format of Tidal, so if that\u2019s your service of choice, the Dragonfly is ideal.</p><h2>Best for super high resolution: Fiio Q3</h2><p></p><p>Fiio has been a popular name in the portable DAC scene for a while now, and for good reason. The products deliver solid audio quality, support all manner of resolutions and are compatible with a wide range of devices. The <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9GaWlPLVEzLUFLNDQ2MkRBQy1UZWNobm9sb2d5LU1vYmlsZVBob25lL2RwL0IwOEs4R1hDSko_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8taW8tMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjcyYTg5YjBhLTAzZDQtNGQyNy05N2E2LTdmYjhhODViMjU0MyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAaovRcXZxP_3kx2spSSN8UF6YMp7OvzdlgV3zOVvNCdJ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFiiO-Q3-AK4462DAC-Technology-MobilePhone%2Fdp%2FB08K8GXCJJ\">Q3</a> is bigger than the previous options on this list (it\u2019s about 1cm shorter than an iPhone 4), but remains fully portable. There are even some goofy silicone bands so you can strap it to your phone, rather than have a flappy, heavy appendage.</p><p>For users on the go, the Q3\u2019s built-in battery (good for about eight hours) means you won\u2019t need to drain the power on whatever you\u2019re plugging it into. It also means mobile users won\u2019t need a dreaded second cable. Throw in support for <em>three</em> different size headphone jacks (sadly, \u00bc-inch isn\u2019t one of them) and you have a DAC that will serve you souped-up sounds wherever you are and whatever you\u2019re listening to.</p><p>There isn\u2019t a display, which you might expect for something this size, but there is an LED that changes color when you\u2019re listening to something higher than 48kHz, so you can tell which tracks in your streaming service\u2019s library really are higher-res. The dedicated volume control doubles as a power knob and there\u2019s also a \u201cbass boost\u201d switch just like the good old days. On top of the USB-C input, there\u2019s also the option for analog audio sources via the 3.5mm port.</p><p>Even if you\u2019re not listening to high sample rate music, the Q3 sounds fantastic. The difference in volume, punch and dynamic range that comes through in songs that sounded flat and dense when listening directly through a phone or laptop was remarkable. Throw in support for all the hertz and bit-depths that you\u2019ll likely ever need and what\u2019s not to like? Especially as the Q3 comes in cheaper than some of the less capable options in this guide (the slight extra heft will be a key factor here).</p><h2>Best for high resolution / fans of Tidal: iFi Hip Dac</h2><p></p><p>If this were a spec race, it\u2019d be a photo finish between Fiio\u2019s Q3 and <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2Ftem4udG8vM3BEamhzSSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNzJhODliMGEtMDNkNC00ZDI3LTk3YTYtN2ZiOGE4NWIyNTQzIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAWxZgLNDfZaX_oy-kERbUADHms0MmEphwQ3TVnJMF0AM&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Famzn.to%2F3pDjhsI\">iFi\u2019s Hip Dac</a>. Like the Q3, the Hip Dac blows right past support for 192kHz right up to 384kHz. It also offers balanced output via 4.4mm headphones which is rare to find on consumer headphones, but some higher-end cans offer it for those who want to eliminate any potential interference. There\u2019s also an internal battery, bass boost and a very similar form-factor to the Q3.</p><p>For anyone interested in either of these two it might come down to a single feature. Be that the highest sample rate it can support (Q3 wins) or its ability to decode Tidal\u2019s MQA files (in which case, you want the Hip Dac).</p><p>The sound out of this thing takes on the Q3 blow for blow and even the same knurled volume control is here. But let\u2019s be honest, the fact it looks like (and was named after) a hip flask is clearly also a major selling point. Though it's worth mentioning the Hip Dac takes a female USB cable, supplied in the box. But this does mean you'll need to use the Camera Kit to get into the iPhone, whereas the Q3 works with one single provided cable.</p><p>Regardless, it\u2019s another robust option that will more than cover most bases for most people. As with the Q3, the internal battery means you won\u2019t need to feed it power while in use (estimated eight hours) and connecting it to your phone or computer is the same; as long as you can pipe a USB cable into it, you\u2019re good to go.</p><h2>Best for desktop warriors: Focusrite Scarlett 2i2</h2><p></p><p>Only looking for a desktop DAC? Then a good old fashioned audio interface might be the best choice for you. <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Gb2N1c3JpdGUtU2NhcmxldHQtQXVkaW8tSW50ZXJmYWNlLVRvb2xzL2RwL0IwN1FSNzNUNjY_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8taW8tMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjcyYTg5YjBhLTAzZDQtNGQyNy05N2E2LTdmYjhhODViMjU0MyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAcKAc__ifo0JpOUhioAN7N8pPf-tOnA5SqurGvoHkHhV&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFocusrite-Scarlett-Audio-Interface-Tools%2Fdp%2FB07QR73T66\">Focusrite\u2019s Scarlett</a> series has near-legendary status at this point and an eye-wateringly high review ratio on Amazon for a good reason: It does what it does very very well.</p><p>Most current laptops and desktops can probably handle at least 96kHz audio, but with the Scarlett you can be sure you are getting the full 192kHz when available and the dedicated audio processors and headphone amps will do a much better job of it.</p><p>The main benefit here is the general upgrade you will be giving to your PC. Not only will your listening experience be enhanced, but you\u2019ll be able to plug in microphones and instruments if streaming or recording are your thing, all in one device and all for about the same price as some of the more mobile-oriented devices on this list.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-best-dac-for-lossless-high-resolution-music-iphone-android-160056147.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/the-best-dac-for-lossless-high-resolution-music-iphone-android-160056147.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-08-15T11:35:06+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The Morning After: Apple Watch X will herald a dramatic redesign", "description": "<p>Apple has a thing for 10th anniversaries: The iPhone X made its debut a decade after the first iPhone arrived.

Reports suggest 2025\u2019s Apple Watch X will ditch the slide-in lugs in favor of magnetic band attachments. Doing so gives Apple more room to make the case bigger, and with it a bigger display and battery, but make the overall package thinner.</p><p>We might also see a bigger, brighter and more efficient microLED screen replacing the existing OLED display. And the X might also add an optical blood pressure sensor to its suite of health-tracking features. (It\u2019s worth saying that optical blood pressure sensing is still a fairly novel technology outside of clinical settings and some niche wearables.)</p><p>With so many features coming to Watch X, the Watch 9 \u2013 which we\u2019re expecting to see arrive this fall \u2013 might be a skip.

The automaker has listed these new offerings as &quot;Standard Range&quot; variants, which are scheduled for delivery in the US sometime in September to October this year. A Model S Standard Range will set buyers back $78,490, while the standard Model X is listed for $88,490. Both prices don't include any savings buyers might get after EV tax credits applicable for their location.&nbsp;</p><p>Both prices are also $10,000 less than the base Model S and Model X vehicles. The new EVs, however, have shorter ranges than the other versions in their line: In the case of Model S, the new option has a range of 320 miles, while the base variant can last for over 80 miles longer with its 405-mile range. It also takes 3.7 seconds for new EV to accelerate from zero to 60 mph, whereas it takes 3.1 seconds for the base version to achieve the same speed. Meanwhile, the new Model X has a range of 269 miles, which is definitely shorter than the base variant's 348 miles.

If it's the latter, then Tesla might give customers the opportunity to unlock longer ranges in the future if they're willing to pay for it. The new Standard Range EVs are available for the aforementioned prices in Pearl White with an all-black interior, along with standard wheels and steering wheel. Buyers will have to pay extra for other colors, customizations, and, of course, for Tesla's Enhanced Autopilot ($6,000) and Full Self-Driving Capability ($15,000) features.&nbsp;</p><p>Tesla is giving current customers the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tesla-offers-customers-one-time-full-self-driving-transfer-until-september-30th-150004266.html\">option to transfer Full Self-Driving</a> to a newly purchased vehicle for free at the moment. That said, they can only take advantage of this one-time amnesty if they take delivery of a new EV between July 20th and September 30th, 2023. Seeing as the new Standard Range vehicles could be delivered after September, buyers should be aware that they might have to pay for FSD again even if they already have it in their current Tesla EV.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/tesla-begins-selling-cheaper-model-s-and-model-x-variants-with-shorter-ranges-082045956.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/tesla-begins-selling-cheaper-model-s-and-model-x-variants-with-shorter-ranges-082045956.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-08-15T08:20:45+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}]
