## Watch: Biden's brain fails him again as he feebly attempts to praise bipartisan... finshalogshun? infalockshum?

Welcome back to another edition of "What Dafuq Did Joe Biden Just Say?" We used to play it <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-pennsylvania-mumble" target="_blank">all the time in 2020</a> and Joe's brain has been decomposing for three more years since.  We take you now to Milwaukee (Algonquin for "the good land") where Joe Biden gave a speech on Bidenomics. No, "Bidenomics" is not the unintelligible thing he said.</p><p>The event started off on a weird note for a competent politician, but par for the course for Joe. He was nowhere to be found. I don't want to say he had another bathroom incident and missed his queue. Other people might say that. But we here at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website have the utmost respect for the office of the presidency. Also, the poor junior staffers who are tasked with cleaning Joe up.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>The speech was full of authentic misinformation. I don't know what else to say about his claim he cut the deficit by $1.7 trillion. When not even WaPo and CNN can carry water for you and call the claim "<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/04/28/bidens-misleading-deficit-claim-earns-him-bottomless-pinocchio/" target="_blank">bottomless pinocchios</a>" and "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/cnn-fact-check-biden-deficit" target="_blank">bizarro world</a>," Joe might want to go back to blaming everything on Putin.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

## 80s TV star gets angry her movie was sold to a network that promotes "family values" so she's doing something in response

A few decades passed and she played Stephanie Tanner in the 2020s sitcom <em>Fuller House</em>. Now she's making "Hallmark" style movies. Sweetin's upset at the network one of her films got sold to and finds herself apologizing to LGBTQ+AIIPEIEIO2 community.</p><p>"I was very surprised to learn by reading about it in the press yesterday that the independent film I worked on over a year ago was sold to Great American Family," <a href="https://people.com/jodie-sweetin-claims-upcoming-film-was-sold-to-great-american-family-channel-without-her-knowledge-exclusive-7642330" target="_blank">the actress had her PR team release in a statement</a>. "I am disappointed, but in keeping with my mission of supporting the LGBTQ+ family, any potential or future money made from this sale will be donated to LGBTQ+ organizations.”</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>Great American Family is at issue here. When the network poached Sweetin's TV sister <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/candace-bure-actually-defend" target="_blank">Candace Cameron Bure</a> from rival Hallmark, the CEO said the network was going to “keep traditional marriage at the core.” Critics like Sweetin believe things like "traditional marriage" and "family values" to be anti-LGBTQ+AIIPEIEIO2 for some reason. I don't get it. </p><p>Don't get me wrong. I enjoy culture war gaming as much as the next right-wing blogger. But the gays I know enjoy corny movies about the same story with the same interchangeable characters, changing only the small town and which one of them moved to the city, as much as us straights do. In fact, if you took five gays and five straights and put them in a focus group, nine out of ten wouldn't notice who was marrying what as much as they'd all agree these movies have been getting lazier and lazier since before the pandemic. </p><p>It's mindless kitsch. Hardly on the same level as Disney seeing <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/little-mermaid-south-korea" target="_self">how broke</a> they can go <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/snow-white-disney-cancels-the-prince" target="_self">getting woke</a>. </p><p>Though because I owe it to the people:</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Poor Jody Sweetin finds her movie being sold to a network that doesn't create stories about a gay couple. Leaving, if that's your thing, every other f*cking network to choose from. Network, as well as streaming. If a "bad" network makes the actress feels so desperate to signal her virtue she needs to cause a stink about it, good for you.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Budweiser blasted for latest desperate attempt to win back customers (that rips off pro-America competitor Yuengling)

<p>There is NEVER a bad time or excuse to support the families of our veterans or first responders. That goes double for families who have lost loved ones in the line of duty. Period. But for some reason, I can't shake this sense of deja vu. Something about this plan to make cans camouflage to raise money for veterans feels familiar...</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>There it is! After Budweisers unfortunate, real-time experiment <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/budweiser-sturgis-motorcycle-rally">on the correlation between getting woke and going broke</a>, an opportunity was presented for another brewery to step up as America's beer. No one better to fill the void than America's oldest brewery, Yuengling.</p><p>Yuengling, <strong><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/yuengling-beer-patriotic-can" target="_blank">three months ago</a></strong>, announced new camouflage cans with a red, white, and blue logo. And proceeds benefit a veterans' charity. Wendy Yuengling, Chief Administrative Officer, said of the collaboration: "As the Oldest Brewery in America, we are dedicated to supporting the U.S. military and are always seeking ways to further show our appreciation to those that protect our country’s freedom. We are grateful to partner with Team Red, White & Blue, an organization that shares our devotion to the men and women that have served as our nation’s heroes.”</p><p>Budweiser sees their former customers looking to Yuengling as their anti-woke option. And as I said, there is never a bad excuse to help our veterans. The difference is when an American-run company does it, it feels more authentic. When a company run by a foreign own global corporation like Anheuser-Busch -- one that has exposed who they REALLY are -- does the same it reeks of desperate pandering.</p><p>And Americans are seeing right through it:</p><p><br /></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Let's recap how we got here with <strong>LWC's Keys to DERPtory</strong>:</p><p>1. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dylan-mulvaney-bud-light" target="_self">Controversial titface performer Dylan Mulvaney</a> announced he and/or she was a new brand ambassador for Bud Light as part of their March Madness campaign. An odd choice since in Dylan's portrayal of a woman he presented as someone too ditzy and basic to know what March Madness was, as opposed to any of the thousands of real girls who love college basketball.</p><p>2. A podcast appearance of now-former Bud Light VP Alissa Heinersceid came to light. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-vice-president-marketing" target="_self">The now disgraced marketing elitist lashed out at Bud Light customers as "fratty" and "out of touch</a>.

There is a trend with progressives where the only way to be "inclusive" and "for everyone" is to sh*t on the people who currently enjoy a product. It's called the <a href="https://boundingintocomics.com/search/kathleen%2bkennedy" target="_blank">Kathleen Kennedy</a> method.</p><p>3.

The rub is humans enjoy eating meat too much. HOWEVER, if people could be genetically modified to stop eating meat, it could be an option. Then he got oddly specific:</p><p>"Possibly, we could use human engineering to make it the case we're allergic to certain kinds of meat, certain kinds of bovine protein. There's this thing called the 'Lonestar Tick' where if it bites you, you will become allergic to meat.

## Australian whines there are too many American flags in America, we've got five reasons for her to suck it

<p>She's hardly the first leftist twat who has whined about the American Flag. It's Virtue Signaling Progressivism 101. But coming from an Australian?</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>When we at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website say "Pay Attention, America" to Leftists running rampant overseas, it was born in Australia, and what the glorified penal colony did to citizens in 2021. During the whole global... you know, the thing. Let's take a quick trip back in time:</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="4edd5" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=34876117&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Australia was <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/australia-freedom-pass" target="_blank">the first country to unveil plans for the “Freedom Pass,” </a>an app that Aussies had to download on their phone to prove they’ve been schmaccinated so they could do, well, anything. To quote the Aussie government, “If you want your life to continue close to normal, get your jab […] No vax means no ‘Freedom Pass’.”</p><p> In the name of public health, Australia said <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/australia-excercise-singles-bubble" target="_self">no exercising and complete isolation</a>, unless the government gave you permission. People weren’t allowed to visit one another either. To get permission to visit someone, one had to register with the state.</p><p>The  <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/australia-police-arrmy" target="_self">Australian army was called in to enforce health orders</a>. They were sent to supplement the police force and go door to door to ensure all citizens were complying with the government mandates. </p><p>There was also the time a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/quarantine-camp-26-year-old" target="_self">woman was thrown in a quarantine facility because her friend tested positive for COVID</a>. She didn't test positive. Her friend did. And the police showed up at her house to drag her away to a facility anyway.</p><p>And my favorite one, Australia's public health chief gleefully referring to lockdowns as being part of the, quote, "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/australia-new-world-order" target="_blank">New World Order</a>."</p><p>So, yeah. Koala Karen can take her Australian whining about her flag, roll it up, dip it in vegemite, and stick it straight up her nose.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Rapper 50 Cent is getting the last laugh after viral flash mob attacks Los Angeles Nordstrom: "Told ya so"

The former drug dealer was once hit with a few slugs. Now he walks with a limp. When Los Angeles reinstated its "zero-bail policy," he called Los Angeles "finished." After yet another flash mob robbing yet another LA department store went viral, 50 is saying "Told ya so."</p><p>The flash mobs are nothing new. Los Angeles police have been warning people to stay out of LA since 2021 because the laws passed by LA politicians <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lapd-warns-people-visit" target="_blank">prevent police from doing much</a>. So seeing between thirty to fifty people rob over $300,000 worth of merch from Nordstrom is not surprising.  Like <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/shoplifting-smash-grab-los-angeles" target="_blank">most theft in Los Angeles</a>, it also will not be surprising <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-12-02/lapd-announces-14-arrests-smash-and-grab-robberies" target="_blank">if the suspects are allowed back out on the streets</a>.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>It's why when LA reinstated the zero-bail policy that not only allows crime like this to happen but encourages it -- since thieves know there are no consequences -- the rapper commented: "LA is finished. Watch how bad it gets out there."</p><p>Turns out he was right. "I told you LA was finished.

There are also progressive-run states where the government is <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/minnesota-ag-lawsuit" target="_blank">filing charges AGAINST small businesses for allowing crime outside of their stores</a>.</p><p>This is in the progressive-run parts of America where progressive voters elect the same progressive politicians over and over again to enact their progressive policies.

## Watch: Trans powerlifter crushes female records after mocking how terrible women are at lifting weights

Critics point to the fact Anne was born a dude as the reason why and believe SHE may have had an unfair advantage. You know, what with testosterone and biology and all that. One thing is for certain. Not since Laurel Hubbard <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/laurel-hubbard-weightlifter-winner-response" target="_blank">shattered the glass ceiling by becoming the first trans powerlifter to choke in the Olympics</a> has such a beautiful and brave competitor taken the powerlifting world by storm.</p><p><a href="https://reduxx.info/male-powerlifter-sets-new-womens-record-during-2023-western-canadian-championship/" target="_blank">REDUXX reports</a> Andres' total would have even been impressive if SHE competed as a man had Canada been concerned with fairness. Again, as critics say, Andres was born a man which is something in a bygone era meant that she is a man. But competing against women who don't have the benefit of being born with testosterone?  Andres wrecked everyone in her path.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>

<p>EDITOR'S NOTE: The tweet should say 210kg. In normal American measurements, Anne lifted more than FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY POUNDS than the nearest competitor.</p><p>The competitor says of her stunning feat: “Today I did some lifting. Not just some lifting. I got to lift with friends from across Canada."</p><p>If the name Anne Andres sounds familiar, SHE went viral in February trash-talking the female competitors about how horrible girls are at lifting weights, even a simple bench press. Outspoken critic of women who were <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/riley-gaines-anthropologist-stumps" target="_blank">born men being allowed to compete against girls</a> (and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/riley-gaines-congressional-hearing" target="_blank">walk around naked in the girls' locker room</a>) Riley Gaines thinks maaaaaaaybe it has to do with Anne have twenty times the testosterone. Until an "independent" "fact" checker chimes in or activists get scientists to change the science, it's difficult to know for sure.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Also in March, Anne stood by and watched HER records be shattered by a man. Avi Silverberg, a Canadian powerlifting coach, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/canada-powerlifting-trolling" target="_blank">self-identified as a woman during</a> the Heroes Classic Powerlifting Meet held in Alberta and beat Andres in the bench press. The difference is Silverberg was only PRETENDING to identify as a woman, so his record didn't count. If a man pretends to identify as a woman, it isn't fair to the actual women. But if a man really identifies as a woman, then it's tolerance and equity and the other women should seek counseling (or reeducation) if they have a problem with it.</p><p>The sky is the limit for Anne Andres!</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Louder with Crowder CEO Gerald Morgan exposes TRUTH behind liberal media's "emergency meeting" hit piece

I gave our employees specific instructions not to comment but that is all changing now.  You want to come after us? Fine. Happy to answer the questions and set the record straight. </p><p>We are imperfect people, all of us, but we are committed to serving our audience and these attacks are coordinated to try and stop us from doing that.  They will not succeed.  I will be addressing items in the hit pieces masquerading as journalism that have been released over the last few months.  Let’s start with the NDA’s and staffers “leaving.”</p><p>July 20th – I received an email asking for comment on an upcoming article regarding Steven Crowder and LWC.  I did not respond.</p><p>July 24th – I called an all staff meeting for 2pm to discuss the show coming back, new formats for the segments, some big wins (Alex Jones!!) and the reason we all needed to respect the need for privacy and not disclose private information to former employees or journalists.  Mind you, we weren’t trying to silence a whistleblower.  It was obvious that these people just didn’t like Steven for whatever reason and were trying to bring him down any way they could.  Just like the left, just like big tech. </p><p>This meeting was also leaked to the press as an “Emergency Staff Meeting,” even after I told the staff about safety concerns that previous leaks had raised for Steven and his family. </p><p>We immediately began a process to determine the source of the leak and to find out if it was done by accident or in malice.  If it was an accidental leak then there would be no consequences, but if by 2pm they had not come forward then I was going to assume it was done in malice and take the proper precautions to protect everyone in the company.  No one came forward.</p><p>Someone sitting in that room with me, who is supposed to have my back in this fight, decided to put me and my family at risk by leaking information from that meeting.  What kind of person does that? </p><p>July 26th – I had our lawyers update the NDA to include more specific penalties for violating the nondisclosure.  I asked everyone to sign them and return them to me by the close of business on the 28th. </p><p>July 27th – We interviewed a few employees that we suspected may have violated their agreements and subsequently suspended two of them.  We wanted to give ourselves time to do further investigation but we thought it wasn’t going to be possible to keep either employee. </p><p>July 28th – One employee met me at the door and resigned, without signing the NDA.  I tried to reach out to this employee that day to discuss our severance package and was told that the only way they wanted to communicate was via email.  This sounded strange to me since we had always had a good working relationship.  That evening, one of the suspended employees resigned, also without signing the NDA.  I reached out to talk with this employee as well and was told that any correspondence could only be made by email. It is very interesting that two employees resign without signing the NDA’s and require any communication to come via email.     </p><p>July 31st – Two employees were let go, one that was suspended and didn’t have anything to do with the leaks to our knowledge, and one additional person. </p><p>Free speech is paramount.  It must exist otherwise we are all doomed.  The ability to tell lies about this company, put employees and their families in danger and leak private proprietary information is not free speech.  It is a breach of contract.  These aren’t whistleblowers, they are people using the cover of Steven’s divorce to try and take him down.</p><p>If any employees have a grievance, my door is always open. No work environment is perfect, no boss has it all figured out. The only way to solve a problem is to be made aware of it. I know who is involved in this and I am choosing not to name them. My goal isn’t to direct hate toward them, my goal is to set the record straight. </p>
