Those in attendance entered a random draw for a chance to win passes to the show. The event name took on quite literal meaning as the concert came on the heels of a massive snowstorm across Minnesota that lasted nearly 48 hours and produced 12 to 20 inches of snow, leaving large snow drifts across the southern and central portions of the state. Nevertheless, music fans' spirits were not dampened, as this concert attests. \n\nSongs Performed\n00:00:00 Color TV\n00:04:19 Kids in the Summer\n00:08:15 Cavity Song\n00:11:40 Leaves\n00:16:09 Off My Mind\n\nCredits\nGuest \u2013 @joepthehyena \nVideo Director \u2013\u00a0Eric Xu Romani\nCamera Operators \u2013\u00a0Guillermo Bonilla, Peter Ecklund\nAudio \u2013\u00a0Evan Clark\nMixer \u2013\u00a0Eric Xu Romani\nGraphics \u2013\u00a0Natalia Toledo\nDigital Producer \u2013\u00a0Luke Taylor\n\nYou rely on The Current to keep you connected to the music you love, and we rely on you to power this station.
