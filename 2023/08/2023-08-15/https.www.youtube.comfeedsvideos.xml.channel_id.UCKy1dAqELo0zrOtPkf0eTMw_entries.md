The time is finally here: Mitchell arrives in Las Vegas to compete in the biggest fighting game tournament in the world: EVO 2023.

With the release of Street Fighter 6, this year's EVO was the biggest it's ever been. And not only were there tons of games to compete in, including Guilty Gear Strive, Tekken 8, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and Melty Blood: Type Lumina, but the show floor was closer to a convention, with Project L and Mortal Kombat 1 being playable. Mitchell guides you through a tour of the Mandalay Bay Convention Center, and then competes in the most high-stakes matches he's ever played.

Join stars Tina Fey (who plays Ariadne Oliver), Kenneth Branagh (who plays Hercule Poirot), Michelle Yeoh (who plays Joyce Reynolds), and Jamie Dornan (who plays Dr. Leslie Ferrier) as they give a behind-the-scenes look at the upcoming movie A Haunting In Venice. The supernatural thriller movie, based on the novel “Hallowe’en Party” by Agatha Christie, also stars Kyle Allen, Camille Cottin, Jude Hill, Ali Khan, Emma Laird, Kelly Reilly, and Riccardo Scamarcio.

A Haunting in Venice is set in eerie, post-World War II Venice on All Hallows’ Eve and is a terrifying mystery featuring the return of the celebrated sleuth, Hercule Poirot. Now retired and living in self-imposed exile in the world’s most glamorous city, Poirot reluctantly attends a séance at a decaying, haunted palazzo. When one of the guests is murdered, the detective is thrust into a sinister world of shadows and secrets.

Reuniting many of the filmmakers behind 2017’s Murder on the Orient Express and 2022’s “Death on the Nile,” the film is directed by Kenneth Branagh with a screenplay by Oscar nominee Michael Green based upon Agatha Christie’s novel “Hallowe’en Party.” The producers are Kenneth Branagh, p.g.a., Judy Hofflund, p.g.a., Ridley Scott, and Simon Kinberg, with Louise Killin, James Prichard, and Mark Gordon serving as executive producers. 

A Haunting In Venice opens in theaters on September 15, 2023.

## Gord Review

Gord reviewed by Jon Bolding on PC. Also available on Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5.

"Any way you look at it, whether it’s an RPG, a real-time strategy game, or a colony sim, Gord is  as miserable as its downtrodden villagers. Other games are bad because they aim too high, attempt too much, and fall down on their own merits. They are at the very least hoisted on their own petard, doing us the favor of digging their own grave or being entertaining in their failures. Gord does not; it simply falls flat and rots where it lies, surrounded by monotonous micromanagement, a poor interface, and by-the-numbers combat. I am content to leave it there, but you may bury it if you like."
