This is another chapter between the two companies' fight to win increasing shares of the airport security market.\n\nWhile an ID check doesn't stop Clear passengers from skipping to the front of the line, some believe it could slow the process enough to hurt the company's ability to charge $189 each year for the service.\n\nClear said that it has been working on a system that would integrate biometric screening with TSA's machines, which would remove the need for a separate ID check, but there isn't a set time for when it would be available.\n\nClear has recently had multiple <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/more-security-issues-for-clear\">security breaches</a> at airports, including an incident where one passenger got through security by digging a boarding pass out of the trash. According to a spokesperson for Clear, TSA has reverified the IDs of 4.7 million Clear travelers in the last six months without citing any issues.\n<h2>Facial recognition for travel reaches more airports in India, gates in Miami</h2>\nDigi Yatra terminals will be launched at six more airports, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Kochi, Lucknow, Jaipur, and Guwahati, to be exact, during August of 2023, according to a release from the Ministry of Civil Aviation. A total of thirteen airports will have the Digi Yatra system.\n\nAs of August 10th, the system has been used by almost 3.5 million passengers, with the mobile app user base reaching almost 1.3 million.\n\nThe Digi Yatra process uses facial recognition to validate identities and does not centrally store passengers' PII data. Passengers' data is instead encrypted and stored in the wallet of their smartphone. Data in the airport's system is deleted within 24 hours of the traveler's departure.\n\nMoreover, <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/article278031803.html\">Miami International Airport</a> (MIA) is in the process of implementing facial recognition to at least 20 more international departure gates, the biggest implementation since the airport began trials in 2018.\n\nA small touchless camera will take a picture of each person and match it to a passport on file, eliminating the need to show a boarding pass.\n\nNext, MIA is looking to implement biometric self-service bag drop to <a href=\"https://aviation.cioreview.com/cxoinsight/modernizing-airports-to-ensure-business-efficiency-nid-37947-cid-209.html\">streamline luggage checks</a>.", "link": "https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/idemia-lobbies-tsa-over-clear-identity-checks-amid-airport-market-share-competition", "date_published": "2023-08-15T21:36:43+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/biometricupdate", "title": "US lower house committee wants investment in some Chinese biometrics firms cut off", "description": "<img alt=\"Dahua\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://d1sr9z1pdl3mb7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/16164545/Dahua.jpg\" width=\"960\" />\n\t\tOnly a few years ago, mentioning China brought smiles to American technology investors and manufacturers.

Trust Stamp shed about a third of its Q2 net loss.

Grace Poe, has called on officials to begin a clampdown on all those still engaged in SIM-card related crimes such as text scams. The call comes about three weeks after a national drive for the mandatory registration of SIM cards with the national digital ID ended. It also coincides with an announcement by Department of Justice (DOJ) officials that they have unearthed an online scam facility involving 28K SIM cards, making it potentially the first criminal case to be handled by the new SIM registration law. Meanwhile, three of the country\u2019s biggest telecoms companies which were involved in the SIM registration process have reported a drop in their subscriber base, but are bullish that the fall in figures is unlikely to negatively affect their business.\n<h2><strong>Fish out text scammers, Sen. Poe urges govt </strong></h2>\nSpeaking in July, a day after the mandatory SIM card registration drive ended, the lawmaker said \u201cthe end of SIM registration signals the beginning of intensified crackdown on mobile phone scammers,\u201d according to the <a href=\"https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1206468\">Philippine News Agency</a> (PNA).\n\nThe Senator called on the national police and other law enforcement officials to make use of the new legal instrument meant to tackle and weed out crime committed via SIM-related methods.\n\n\u201cIt is a challenge for the law enforcers to make a sample out of the SIM Registration Law violators,\u201d she said, assuring that the law has sufficient safeguards on users\u2019 right to privacy.\n<h2><strong>First potential SIM-related fraud case identified</strong></h2>\nWhile Sen. Poe has urged government officials to show no mercy to SIM fraudsters, the DOJ has revealed that it has come across a situation which could turn out to be the first actionable case under the legislation.\n\nAs ABC-CBN News <a href=\"https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/08/08/23/doj-28000-sim-cards-from-pogo-hub-raid-possibly-used-in-scams\">reports</a>, Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla told reporters recently that 28,000 SIM cards were unearthed from a Philippine Offshore Gaming Operator (POGO) believed to be used for scam operations.\n\nThe official said the discovery is disquieting and they are trying to figure out whether the SIM Registration Act is applicable to the matter. He also said they\u2019ll resolutely pursue whoever has the SIM cards registered in their name.\n\nRemulla also disclosed that during the raid on the facility, 650 POGO staff were rounded up, but just a little over 100 of them eventually faced accusations of love and cryptocurrency scams. There are said to be foreigners among the suspected scammers.\n\nThe DOJ has also raised concerns that some of the unregistered SIM cards are used on messaging apps which are used to hoodwink victims.\n\nMeanwhile, Rappler <a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/nation/cyberscam-network-system-dodges-sim-card-registration-law/\">reports</a> that investigators also found that some of the SIMs were registered to digital IDs while still in their packets. Officials said they were working to find out how that was possible.\n\nAlso, government has solicited support from telcos in an effort to stop these scammers from exploiting existing loopholes.\n\nThe telcos, in the meantime, have said although they suffered SIM subscriber losses after the mandatory registration exercise, that may not have any major toll on their business performance.\n\nThe three telcos -- Smart, Globo and DITO -- are said to have lost about 33 percent of their total subscribers, according to the National Telecommunications Commission, GMA News <a href=\"https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/money/companies/878591/telcos-unfazed-by-subscriber-loss-after-sim-registration/story/\">reports</a>.\n\nThe drive to link SIM cards with PhilIDs ended on July 25 with about 113 million registered SIMs. It started off well before <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202301/pushback-against-sim-registration-in-philippines-as-india-adds-facial-recognition-checks\">protests erupted</a> along the line over data privacy concerns.", "link": "https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/filipino-mp-urges-crackdown-on-unregistered-sims-as-first-actionable-case-discovered", "date_published": "2023-08-15T17:32:26+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/biometricupdate", "title": "Data protection authorities in Kenya, Argentina investigating Worldcoin", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"1408\" src=\"https://d1sr9z1pdl3mb7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/07140653/iris-biometric-scaled.jpg\" width=\"2048\" />\n\t\tData protection authorities in Kenya and Argentina are examining Worldcoin\u2019s operations to determine if its biometric enrollment process violates national data protection laws.\n\nKenya\u2019s Office of the Data Protection Commissioner (ODPC) says in legal filings that it had issued a directive to Worldcoin to suspend its operation, but the company did not comply, <a href=\"https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2023-08-14-data-protection-seeks-courts-intervention-in-worldcoin-project/\">The Star</a> reports.
