<p>I’ve been looking and can only find “Learn Vimscript The Hard Way”.<p>The website I remember had a man in front of some control panel, maybe wearing a space suite, and started with a section named something like “Learn to Crawl”.<p>Does anyone know what I’m talking about?</p>

## Show HN: Layerform (YC S23) – Open-source dev environments using Terraform files

<p>Hi HN, we're Lucas and Lucas, the authors of Layerform (https://github.com/ergomake/layerform). Layerform is an open-source tool for setting up development environments using plain .tf files. We allow each engineer to create their own "staging" environment and reuse infrastructure.<p>Whenever engineers run layerform spawn, we use plain .tf files to give them their own "staging" environment that looks just like production.<p>Many teams have a single (or too few) staging environments, which developers have to queue to use. This is particularly a problem when a system is large, because then engineers can't run it on their machines and cannot easily test their changes in a production-like environment. Often they end up with a cluttered Slack channel in which engineers wait for their turn to use staging. Sometimes, they don't even have that clunky channel and end up merging broken code or shipping bugs to production. Lucas and I decided to solve this because we previously suffered with shared staging environments.<p>Layerform gives each developer their own production-like environment.This eliminates the bottleneck, increasing the number of deploys engineers make. Additionally, it reduces the amount of bugs and rework because developers have a production-like environment to develop and test against. They can just run "layerform spawn" and get their own staging.<p>We wrap the MPL-licensed Terraform and allow engineers to encapsulate each part of their infrastructure into layers. They can then create multiple instances of a particular layer to create a development environment.The benefit of using layers instead of raw Terraform modules is that they're much easier to write and reuse, meaning multiple development environments can run on top of the same infrastructure.<p>Layerform's environments are quick and cheap to spin up because they share core pieces of infrastructure. Additionally, Layerform can automatically tag components in each layer, making it easier for FinOps teams to manage costs and do chargebacks.<p>For example: with Layerform, a product developer can spin up their own lambdas and pods for staging while still using a shared Kubernetes cluster and Kafka instance. That way, development environments are quicker to spin up and cheaper to maintain. Each developer's layer also gets a tag, meaning FinOps teams know how much each team's environments cost.<p>For the sake of transparency, the way we intend to make money is by providing a managed service with governance, management, and cost-control features, including turning off environments automatically on inactivity or after business hours. The Layerform CLI itself will remain free and open.<p>You can download the Layerform CLI right now and use it for free. Currently, all the state, permissions, and layer definitions stay in your cloud, under your control.<p>After the whole license change thing, I think it's also worth mentioning we'll be building on top of the community's fork and will consider adding support for Pulumi too.<p>We'd love your feedback on our solution to eliminate “the staging bottleneck". What do you think?</p>

<p>Hi HN! Today we are releasing Lottielab, a web-based animation tool, to the public as an open beta. The main tool for editing and exporting Lottie animations today is Adobe After Effects, a 30-year-old visual effects tool that’s not fit for this purpose, has a steep learning curve, and requires a patchwork of error-prone plugins. With Lottielab, we are aiming to reduce the friction of creating and editing product animations by providing an easy-to-use editor with out-of-the-box support for import and export of the Lottie format and many others. Feel free to play around with the tool and let me know what you think - I'm here to answer your questions. Happy animating!</p>

## Show HN: Servicer, pm2 alternative built on rust and systemd
 - [https://servicer.dev](https://servicer.dev)
 - RSS feed: https://hnrss.org/frontpage
 - date published: 2023-08-15T11:34:26+00:00

<p>Servicer is a CLI to create and manage services on systemd. I have used pm2 in production and find it easy to use. However a lot of its functionality is specific to node.js, and I would prefer not to run my rust server as a fork of a node process. Systemd on the other hand has most of the things I need, but I found it cumbersome to use. There are a bunch of different commands and configurations- the .service file, systemctl to view status, journald to view logs which make systemd more complex to setup. I had to google for the a template and commands every time.<p>Servicer abstracts this setup behind an easy to use CLI, for instance you can use `ser create index.js --interpreter node --enable --start` to create a `.service` file, enable it on boot and start it. Servicer will also help if you wish to write your own custom `.service` files. Run `ser edit foo --editor vi` to create a service file in Vim. Servicer will provide a starting template so you don't need to google it. There are additional utilities like `ser which index.js` to view the path of the service and unit file.<p>```
Paths for index.js.ser.service:
+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| name         | path                                                      |
+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Service file | /etc/systemd/system/index.js.ser.service                  |
+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Unit file    | /org/freedesktop/systemd1/unit/index_2ejs_2eser_2eservice |
+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
```<p>Servicer is daemonless and does not run in the background. It simply sets up systemd and gets out of the way. There are no forked services, everything is natively set up on systemd. You don't need to worry about resource consumption or servicer going down which will cause your app to stop.<p>Do give it a spin and review the codebase. The code is open source and MIT licensed- <a href="https://github.com/servicer-labs/servicer">https://github.com/servicer-labs/servicer</a></p>

## Ask HN: I learned useless skill of prompt engineering, how relevant will it be?

<p>I consider myself to be a pretty good prompter. Been using the LLMs for a long time now. Most of the time I manage to get the desired results out of LLM models. Do you think this skill is anywhere useful?<p>So far it has saved me some time on my work, but I don't think promoting will be any relevant in the near future. People can and will build models that follow the same mode of thought.</p>

## Tell HN: t.co is adding a five-second delay to some domains

<p>Go to Twitter and click on a link going to any url on "NYTimes.com" or "threads.net" and you'll see about a ~5 second delay before t.co forwards you to the right address.<p>Twitter won't ban domains they don't like but will waste your time if you visit them.<p>I've been tracking the NYT delay ever since it was added (8/4, roughly noon Pacific time), and the delay is so consistent it's obviously deliberate.</p>
