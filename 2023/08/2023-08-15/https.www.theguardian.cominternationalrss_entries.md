<p>Unsurprisingly, garlic, chilli and lemon feature highly in our panel’s list of flavour-bombs, but there’s also Calabrian chilli, tamarind and even an ancient Roman fish sauce …</p><p><strong>What jars and pastes can I rely on for instant flavour?<br /></strong><em><strong>Jo, Stroud, Gloucestershire</strong><br /></em>There’s a fine line between basic and brilliant, and the secret is often in the sauce – or paste or condiment, for that matter. “There are a few things I keep handy to inject quick flavour, umami and seasoning,” says <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pippyeats/?hl=en">Pippa Middlehurst</a>, whose new book, <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/simple-noodles-9781787139541">Simple Noodles: Everyday Recipes, from Instant to Udon</a>, is out this month. “They can be very versatile, so long as you know where to use them.”</p><p>One case in point is miso. While the Japanese fermented soya bean paste “has many traditional uses, such as miso soup or to season ramen or <em>nabe</em>”, Middlehurst also adds a tablespoon to spaghetti with chopped garlic and butter “for a super-quick meal with high-impact flavour”, and also tosses some through tomatoes before roasting.</p><p>Got a culinary dilemma?

<p>The Philadelphia-born artist has created a new exhibition focused on the importance of chosen families within the LGBTQ+ community</p><p>“Chosen family are the folks that love you undeniably, unconditionally,” artist David Antonio Cruz tells the Guardian. “They don’t come with restrictions or rules.” He’s been thinking about chosen family a lot lately, as his new solo show at the Institute of Contemporary Art at the University of Pennsylvania is all about tracing his steps back to the non-biological family that has nurtured him. When the Children Come Home marks a long overdue return to his hometown, the celebrated artist’s first-ever solo show in the city that raised him.</p><p>“It’s very special to have a solo exhibition in Philadelphia,” Cruz said. “Home can mean many things, and sometimes home is challenging. It’s a choice, and coming back meant that I wanted to think about the city and its impact on me. This is where it began, it’s really beautiful.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/aug/15/artist-david-antonio-cruz-lgbtq-chosen-families-exhibition-philadelphia">Continue reading...</a>

## Football transfer rumours: Zaniolo to Aston Villa? Baleba to Liverpool?

<p>Today’s fluff is on a scouting mission</p><p>After losing Emi Buendía and Tyrone Mings to serious injuries – not to mention their opening game of the season to Newcastle United – <strong>Aston Villa</strong> are in dire need of a pick-me-up and Unai Emery hopes to boost morale by signing <strong>Nicolò Zaniolo</strong> from Galatasaray. The Italian midfielder is open to the move and the club’s manager, Okan Buruk, has made it clear Galatasaray are prepared to sell if the price is right.</p><p>Having been made to look rather silly following their failed attempts to bolster their midfield by bringing in Moisés Caicedo and Roméo Lavia, <strong>Liverpool</strong>’s recruitment department might be tempted to hijack <strong>Brighton</strong>’s proposed purchase of <strong>Carlos Baleba</strong> from Lille for the thick end of £14m. The Cameroonian central midfielder is only 19 and has just 20 senior appearances under his belt but beating Brighton to his signature now would prevent Liverpool being gazumped by Chelsea when Brighton decide to move him on for £120m in January.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/15/football-transfer-rumours-zaniolo-to-aston-villa-baleba-to-liverpool">Continue reading...</a>
