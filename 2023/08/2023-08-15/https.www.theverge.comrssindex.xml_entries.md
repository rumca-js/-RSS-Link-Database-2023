  <p id="7pXueE">X, the social network formally known as Twitter, appears to be finally following through on its promise to make TweetDeck a paid service. Many users on X, <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1691575096081625488">including social media consultant Matt Navarra</a>, say that they’re seeing a sales page for X Premium (the subscription formerly Twitter Blue) when they try to load up TweetDeck, which is technically now called XPro.</p>
<p id="BX3dpS">A few of us at <em>The Verge</em> haven’t run into the block yet, but given how many people are saying that they can’t access XPro unless they pay, we’re guessing it’s only a matter of time.</p>
<p id="PjUnAT">Unfortunately, we knew this was coming, as X announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/3/23783092/twitter-tweetdeck-new-preview-force-legacy-apis">on July 3rd</a> that it would be making XPro a subscriber-only feature.

By the end of 2024, the company said it would roll out gas-electric hybrid versions of its entire lineup.

  <p id="Dk4Bf9">Google is adding <a href="https://blog.google/products/photos/google-photos-memories-view/">a new Memories tab</a> to its Photos app to create a dedicated place for auto-generated collections of pictures. The company is adding new generative AI titling features that can help you name your photo collections, too.</p>
<p id="LdfZDA">These Google-generated collections have shown up at the top of the Photos app for years, but they’ll now have a dedicated button at the bottom of the app. Default titles for memories are often location-based names using images’ GPS metadata. The new AI titles feature helps to summarize the Instagram Stories-like style presentations with a bit more fun and detail.</p>

  <p id="bKJuw9">Your iPhone’s aging lithium-ion batteries will eventually start to lose their ability to retain a charge — and that can be highly frustrating, especially if you’re out and about all day. And that’s not to mention reports that some iPhone batteries — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/12/23829897/apple-iphone-14-pro-battery-health-capacity">specifically those belonging to the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro</a> — may be experiencing more battery degradation than their users expected.</p>

  <p id="eVXNGI">It’s finally here — the official music video for “Planet of the Bass,” arguably <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23816082/planet-of-the-bass-dj-crazy-times-song-meme">the internet’s song of the summer</a>, has been released. You can watch it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-OgkNgxm3k">right here on YouTube</a>, though I wouldn’t blame you if you already clicked the play button in the video embed at the top of this post.</p>
<p id="11m9C5">“Planet of the Bass” is a ridiculous parody of Eurodance music I remember hearing as a kid, and it’s become A Thing on the internet thanks to creator Kyle Gordon’s absurd video clips of the song. I think <a href="https://twitter.com/kylegordon101/status/1684963728427462656">the first is still my favorite</a>, but the <a href="https://twitter.com/kylegordon101/status/1687126462296412161">subsequent</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/kylegordon101/status/1688550068142379010">clips</a> that swapped out the woman in the video without changing her voice were pretty good.</p>

It’s called Samples, and it occupies a new tab in the YouTube Music app. The company describes it as “a seamless feed of short form video segments to get you to your new favorite music,” which is just TikTok. Samples is TikTok, except it’s exclusively made up of small snippets of music videos. Given the way music discovery operates in 2023, it could work.</p>
<p id="tkAUy6">The Samples feed is a personalized one, so when you open it, the app will attempt to provide you with a wide swath of music you might be into.

  		 <p>Apple hasn’t updated the iMac in well over two years, and it sells far more laptops than desktops these days. What does all of that mean for the future of the desktop computer that saved Apple from bankruptcy 25 years ago?</p>

If you missed its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiZhFd4Yhb4">international launch</a>, which flew under the radar for many, let me catch you up: the StanbyME Go is a 27-inch 1080p LCD TV housed in a large suitcase that also contains a built-in battery and 20-watt speakers. </p>
<p id="njJj8b">The idea is that this thing can be a portable entertainment solution whether you’re at a picnic, on a family vacation, or just hanging out on the back patio. Maybe you’ll bring it tailgating with all your pals during football season. The possibilities are limited only by your imagination and the StanbyME Go’s three-hour...</p>

  <p id="J2Eyt7">YouTube will remove content that promotes “cancer treatments proven to be harmful or ineffective” or which “discourages viewers from seeking professional medical treatment,” <a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/a-long-term-vision-for-medical-misinformation-policies/">the video platform announced today</a>. The enforcement comes as YouTube is attempting to streamline its medical moderation guidelines based on what it’s learned while attempting to tackle misinformation around topics like covid-19, vaccines, and reproductive health.</p>
<p id="r8oqKG">Going forward, Google’s video platform says it will apply its medical misinformation policies when there is a high public health risk, when there is publicly available guidance from health authorities, and when a topic is prone to misinformation. YouTube hopes that this policy framework will be flexible...</p>

  <p id="fHFdNL">Aqara has released a new Zigbee RGB smart light strip <a href="https://www.aqara.com/en/product/led-strip-t1/">called the LED Strip T1</a>. It costs $49.99, requires an Aqara hub, and is compatible with Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and IFTTT. When paired with certain hubs, including the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523877/aqara-smart-home-review-m2-hub-homekit-alexa-google-assistant">Aqara Hub M2</a>, the light strip is also compatible with the Matter smart home protocol. </p>
<p id="yPr5MA">The T1 is one of the very few light strips that support Apple’s Adaptive Lighting feature — and the only one that supports both Adaptive Lighting <em>and</em> Matter. It doesn’t support Adaptive Lighting <em>through</em> Matter, unfortunately; nothing does. Still, it’s nice to see new, Matter-compliant lighting come to market using the solid Zigbee standard. (Whatever happened to that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/3/23438437/philips-hue-bridge-matter-certified-smart-home-update">Hue-to-Matter</a> bridge, I wonder?) </p>

  <p id="BRwRlu">Substack now lets you follow writers, offering a way for you to keep tabs on what a writer is doing without having to subscribe to their newsletter. When you follow a writer, “you can stay up to date with what they’re reading, liking, publishing, and subscribing to — through the Notes feed and on their profiles,” <a href="https://on.substack.com/p/follow">Substack says in a blog post</a>.</p>
<p id="10fxzp">Substack is perhaps best known as a newsletter platform where writers can make money from getting people to sign up for paid subscriptions. But the platform has also been dabbling with more traditional social networking features <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/11/23677946/substack-notes-twitter-throttled-blocked-links">such as its tweet-like Notes</a>, and a follow button feels like Substack stepping even more toes into the social networking waters. </p>
