Security and privacy aren't linked in any way. The general best practice is to find the services you need that have a good reputation for security, and among these services, try and find one that is private enough for your needs.\n\nTelemetry is always bad\n\nThis is simply not true. Telemetry isn't always bad. The image we have of telemetry is that of Windows or macOS, but there are plenty of other ways to do telemetry.\n\nIn itself telemetry is a very useful thing: it lets projects or companies identify what is important, what they should fix first. It doesn't mean this data is used to profile you, or being sold to anyone. \n\nIf the company or project is something you trust, and that has no current business in data collection, or advertising, then it's probably not a problem.\n\nTor is an NSA honeypot\n\nTOR is regularly accused of being a honeypot for the NSA. Something that is completely false, as far as anyone knows**\n\nYes, TOR is based on code developed by the US Navy. Funding for Tor also came from the US government, mostly. The code, however, is open source, and audited.\n\nIs Tor entirely safe? Of course not. It's not a silver bullet, nothing is, and it can be vulnerable to man in the middle attacks or to specific types of monitoring, but it's not an NSA project that's designed to trap you.\n\nBig companies are more secure\n\nThis statement is debatable. It's true in some cases. A recent report shows that smaller firms are 3 times more likely to be attacked than big businesses. 60% of cyberattacks seem to target smaller companies. But that's likelihood to be attacked, not necessarily successful attacks.\n\nWhat is also true is that not all big tech companies are very good on the security front. So, while yes, bigger companies can be more secure than smaller ones, it's not a one size fits all thing, and what you need to look for is what kind of security the company you're interested in for a specific service or app has put in place.\n\nIncognito mode is private\n\nIt isn't. What incognito mode does, is make you private locally, on your device, as it doesn't store data on what you've visited, your credentials, and the like.\n\nIncognito mode doesn't, however, prevent websites from tracking you, or fingerprinting you.\n\nVPNs are the only privacy tool you need\n\nVPNs aren't a magical thing that instantly makes you private. Using a VPN will change your IP address and make you harder to track online, that's true. They're a good tool, but you need to make sure that the company that provides the VPN service doesn't log everything you do, and doesn't give these logs to various other actors. If you log into a service or website while using a VPN, it still knows it's you, obviously.\n\nPrivacy is impossible\n\nThis one has to be the most nefarious myth ever. Privacy is NOT impossible. It's not easy, but it's not impossible. Generally, this statement just betrays a lack of motivation. It will never be 100% perfect, but you can limit immensely what is known or collected about you.\n\nI have nothing to hide\n\nThis is complete bogus. First, if you think you have nothing to hide, you're wrong. Everyone has something that might not be illegal, but might be deemed immoral or unacceptable by someone else.\n\nSecond, you might feel this way now, but circumstances change, and the data collected about you doesn't go away. By leaving all these tidbits of data stored everywhere, you're basically giving ammunition to the future.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiLahJp8UEs", "date_published": "2023-08-15T15:56:48+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/TiLahJp8UEs/hqdefault.jpg"}]
