This new panel type has roughly double the contrast ratio of a typical IPS panel, delivering a richer, deeper image. It&rsquo;s also an extremely bright monitor with a maximum brightness of over 450 nits. Color performance is also top-notch with precise color accuracy and a wide color gamut spanning 99 percent of the DCI-P3 color space.</p>\n\n<p>Home office owners will be equally impressed by its connectivity. This monitor has USB-C with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and up to 95 watts of Power Delivery for charging a connected device. When connected over USB-C, the monitor acts as a feature-rich hub with not only USB-A ports but also ethernet and DisplayPort-out. This monitor can replace a USB-C hub or dock on your desk.</p>\n\n<p>The monitor&rsquo;s ergonomics are great, too. It has significant adjustment for height, tilt, swivel, and can even rotate 90 degrees for portrait use&mdash;an uncommon feature for a monitor this large.</p>\n\n<p>If the Dell U3223QE is too large, or expensive, consider its smaller sibling: <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-ultrasharp-27-4k-usb-c-hub-monitor-u2723qe/apd/210-bdpf/monitors-monitor-accessories&amp;xcust=2-1-1389780-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Dell U2723QE</a>.

The Acer K242HYL is it.</p>\n\n<p>Acer&rsquo;s K242HYL is a 24-inch, 1080p monitor. It&rsquo;s not as sharp as a premium, 4K monitor, but image clarity is not bad for a monitor in this price bracket. The K242HYL also packs a respectable maximum brightness of almost 300 nits, good color accuracy, and supports 98 percent of the sRGB gamut. None of these figures are record breaking, but they&rsquo;re great for a budget monitor.</p>\n\n<p>The monitor lacks a height-adjustable stands, but this is common at this price. A VESA monitor stand mount is available for adding a third-party monitor stand. &nbsp;Video connectivity is limited to just one HDMI and one VGA. The monitor does throw in a few perks, though, including AMD FreeSync support for smooth gaming and a slightly enhanced 75Hz refresh rate.</p>\n\n<p>Often priced at just $99.99, the Acer K242HYL is an impressive value. It&rsquo;s the least capable monitor on this list, to be sure&mdash;but it&rsquo;s more than adequate for document editing, accounting, project management, video conferencing, and hundreds of other home office tasks.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/631916/acer-k242hyl-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAcer K242HYL review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ad page-ad has-ad-prefix ad-article\"></div>\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-separator\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart-item product-chart-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper--title product-chart-title \" id=\"asus-proart-pa279crv-best-4k-home-office-monitor\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAsus ProArt PA279CRV &ndash; Best 4K home office monitor\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"large-pro-cons-product-chart-section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproduct-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper--large\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Asus ProArt PA279CRV - Best 4K home office monitor\" class=\"product-chart-item__image\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/asus-proart-pa279crv-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1500\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-columns\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tPlenty of connectivity\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tNumerous image-quality options\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tExtremely wide color-gamut\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tGood value for money\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tMediocre contrast and brightness\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tSubpar HDR performance\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tUnimpressive motion clarity\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__information \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-label\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"not-amp\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1762484-REG/asus_pa279crv_27_4k_hdr_uhd.html?ap=y&amp;smp=y&amp;msclkid=590d1e8a7c9711acc77d7a5f4d39e657?BI=21883&amp;KBID=28249\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$469.00 at  B &amp; H Photo</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>The Asus ProArt PA279CRV is an outstanding home office monitor for professionals, artists, and creators seeking exceptional color performance at an affordable price.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It has a 27-inch 4K display that packs 163 pixels per inch. That translates to outstanding sharpness and clarity across apps, web pages, movies, and games. The monitor also has a remarkably wide color gamut that rivals more expensive displays, covering 100 percent of sRGB, 99 percent of DCI-P3, and 98 percent of AdobeRGB.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Asus pairs the monitor&rsquo;s excellent image quality with elegant design and a sturdy, ergonomic stand that supports height, tilt, swivel, and pivot adjustments. The monitor&rsquo;s extensive connectivity options include USB-C with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and 96 watts Power Delivery, two DisplayPort 1.4 (including one output supporting Daisy Chain), two HDMI 2.0, and three USB-A 3.2 Gen-1 ports, as well as a 3.5mm audio-out.</p>\n\n<p>The PA279CRV has a mediocre contrast ratio and struggles with detail and ambiance in dark content. It also offers a modest 60Hz refresh rate, which amounts to lackluster motion fluidity in games.</p>\n\n<p>These downsides are easily excused by Asus&rsquo; competitive MSRP of $469. That&rsquo;s an extremely low price for a monitor that offers 4K resolution and top-tier color gamut alongside gobs of ports.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1794810/asus-proart-pa279crv-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tProArt PA279CRV review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ad page-ad has-ad-prefix ad-article\"></div>\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-separator\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart-item product-chart-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper--title product-chart-title \" id=\"nzxt-canvas-27q-best-1440p-home-office-monitor\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNZXT Canvas 27Q &ndash; Best 1440p home office monitor\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"large-pro-cons-product-chart-section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproduct-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper--large\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"NZXT Canvas 27Q - Best 1440p home office monitor\" class=\"product-chart-item__image\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/nzxt-canvas-27q-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1500\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-columns\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tAttractive and robust design\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tFour video inputs including USB-C\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tGreat color performance\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tHigh motion clarity at 144Hz and 165Hz\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tLimited image quality adjustment\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tSpeakers not included\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tHDR mode is barebones\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__information \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-label\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"not-amp\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://nzxt.com/product/canvas-27q&amp;xcust=2-1-1389780-6-828357-14418&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$339.99 at  NZXT</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>NZXT&rsquo;s Canvas 27Q is a great mid-range home office monitor and the best value pick on this list. It&rsquo;s a smart choice if you want attractive image quality without spending a fortune. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The Canvas 27Q is a 27-inch monitor with 1440p resolution, which provides a nice boost in clarity over 1080p. This is a bright monitor, reaching nearly 380 nits at maximum brightness. It&rsquo;s also color accurate and supports up to 97 percent of the DCI-P3 color space.</p>\n\n<p>This monitor has a USB-C port with DisplayPort Alternate Mode. The USB-C port acts as a hub for two USB-A ports. Unlike most monitors, this one doesn&rsquo;t come with a stand: The stand is a $40 add-on. It&rsquo;s a great stand, though, with height, tilt, and swivel adjustment, and a sturdy feel. A $100 monitor arm is also available.</p>\n\n<p>Want to fire up a game after work? The Canvas 27Q has you covered. It has a maximum refresh rate of 165Hz and supports both AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync for smooth motion in games.</p>\n\n<p>The Canvas 27Q has an MSRP of $339.99 but is often discounted to $249.99. The $40 stand brings the total price to $289.99. That&rsquo;s excellent value given the monitor&rsquo;s image quality and many features.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/828353/nzxt-canvas-27q-monitor-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNZXT Canvas 27Q review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ad page-ad has-ad-prefix ad-article\"></div>\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-separator\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart-item product-chart-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper--title product-chart-title \" id=\"dell-ultrasharp-u4924dw-best-super-ultrawide-home-office-monitor\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDell Ultrasharp U4924DW &ndash; Best super-ultrawide home office monitor\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"large-pro-cons-product-chart-section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproduct-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper--large\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Dell Ultrasharp U4924DW - Best super-ultrawide home office monitor\" class=\"product-chart-item__image\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dell-ultrasharp-u4924dw-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1500\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-columns\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tExcellent build quality and stand\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tLots of connectivity including USB-C\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tEasy-to-use menu with numerous options\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tIPS Black improves contrast ratio\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tImage quality is mediocre overall\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tNo HDR or Adaptive Sync\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tExpensive for its feature set\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__information \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"not-amp\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-ultrasharp-49-curved-usb-c-hub-monitor-u4924dw/apd/210-bgtz/monitors-monitor-accessories&amp;xcust=2-1-1389780-6-1813220-11245&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">1359.99 at  Dell</a><a class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8200811-13502820?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdell-ultrasharp-49-curved-usb-c-hub-monitor-u4924dw%2Fapd%2F210-bgtz%2Fmonitors-monitor-accessories?sid=2-1-1389780-6-1813220-11245\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$1359.99 at  Dell Home</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>The Dell Ultrasharp U4924DW is ideal for home office workers who want a super-ultrawide monitor with USB-C capabilities. Although the display is curved, the curve is more subtle than most monitors of the same size. This improves the user experience by reducing the visual distortion a curved display can introduce.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Dell provides many small touches that make the monitor easy to use in a home office. The stand is sturdy yet small, which leaves more space free on your desk. It also has VESA mount options for both 200x100mm and 100x100mm mounts, providing wide support for third-party monitor arms, stands, and even wall mounts. The monitor supports picture-in-picture and picture-by-picture modes and can be used to view two input devices at once.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The U4924DW stands out with top-notch USB-C connectivity. It provides a USB-C hub with six downstream USB ports (four USB-A, two USB-C), ethernet, and audio-out. These are driven by a USB-C port supporting DisplayPort Alternate Mode and delivering 90 watts of Power Delivery.

An integrated lightbar is provided to brighten dark rooms and the entire camera assembly can retract into the monitor, effectively acting as a privacy shutter. The built-in soundbar has two 5-watt speakers that deliver good volume and crisp audio for video or audio calls. They&rsquo;re paired with a noise-cancelling microphone that prevents echoes and can eliminate most soft, repetitive sounds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Viewsonic includes a wide range of connectivity. The monitor has a USB-C with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and 90 watts of Power Delivery for charging a connected device. It also acts as a USB-C hub that powers two USB-A ports and an ethernet connection. Video inputs include HDMI and DisplayPort for a total of three video inputs.</p>\n\n<p>Image quality is good with excellent sharpness, adequate brightness, and an acceptable contrast ratio. The VG2756V-2K does not support HDR, however, and is not recommended for gaming due to its 60Hz refresh rate and lack of Adaptive Sync.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The Viewsonic VG2756V-2K is competitively priced with an MSRP of $399. That&rsquo;s expensive for a 27-inch 1440p monitor, but the premium you&rsquo;re paying for the monitor&rsquo;s bundled features is less than you&rsquo;d pay for a webcam, microphone, and desktop speakers purchased individually.

Acer&rsquo;s Vero BR277 isn&rsquo;t going to solve this problem on its own&mdash;but it tries.</p>\n\n<p>The Acer Vero BR277, like other Acer Vero products, is partially built from Post-Consumer Recycled Plastics. Despite what you may think, these plastics feel robust. They also have a unique flecked look that stands out from other, less visually interesting designs.</p>\n\n<p>How the monitor is built wouldn&rsquo;t matter if it was junk&mdash;thankfully, it&rsquo;s quite good. This is a 27-inch 1080p monitor with a respectable maximum brightness of just over 300 nits. The monitor&rsquo;s color gamut is a bit limited at just 97 precent of sRGB, but it scores well in color accuracy and contrast. The result? Bright, pleasant, realistic image quality.</p>\n\n<p>The monitor has an ergonomic stand that adjusts for height, swivel, and tilt. It also supports AMD FreeSync for smooth gaming and has a maximum refresh of 75Hz.</p>\n\n<p>Pricing is competitive. The monitor originally released at an MSRP of $249.99 but can now be found as low as $169.99. That&rsquo;s a great price for a home office monitor with good image quality and a height-adjustable stand. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09XR9GKFJ?ots=1&amp;tag=pcworld02-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Farticle%2F791232%2Facer-vero-br277-monitor-review.html\">Acer also has a 24-inch model</a>, which is even less expensive at $129.99.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/791232/acer-vero-br277-monitor-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAcer Vero BR277 review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ad page-ad has-ad-prefix ad-article\"></div>\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-separator\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart-item product-chart-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper--title product-chart-title \" id=\"asus-zenscreen-mb249c-best-second-monitor\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAsus ZenScreen MB249C &ndash; Best second monitor\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"large-pro-cons-product-chart-section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproduct-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper--large\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Asus ZenScreen MB249C - Best second monitor\" class=\"product-chart-item__image\" height=\"4480\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/asus-zenscreen-mb249c-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"6720\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-columns\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tSmall, versatile desk stand with unique options\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tSturdy built-in kickstand for portable use\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tOffers USB-C for easy single-cable connections\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tGood image quality\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tLacks additional connection options\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tOnly 1080p resolution\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tA bit pricey for its feature set\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__information \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>Asus&rsquo; ZenScreen MB249C is a portable home office monitor that can be mounted next to a primary monitor in several ways.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The MB249C has an adjustable desk stand that can clamp to the back of your desk instead of sitting on top of it, which reduces wire clutter and keeps the surface of your desk free. The monitor also has a built-in kickstand, which is great for portable use, and a &ldquo;partition mount&rdquo; to hang the monitor from a vertical surface. The options end with a 100x100mm VESA mount that is compatible with most third-party monitor arms and stands. These options make the MB249C easy to place next to your primary monitor even in cramped spaces.</p>\n\n<p>This is a portable monitor, as mentioned, which means it&rsquo;s easy to move. The monitor mounts to its stand with a clip mechanism that&rsquo;s easily detached, and the built-in kickstand can flip out to support the monitor on most flat surfaces. It&rsquo;s powered by either a USB-C connection that supports up to 60 watts of Power Delivery or the included power adapter. Not everyone will need the monitor&rsquo;s portable versatility, but it&rsquo;s handy if you like to work in different locations throughout the day.</p>\n\n<p>Once in place, the MB249C is a competent office and productivity monitor. While it lacks the wow-factor of more expensive alternatives, like the Dell U3223QE, Asus delivers a robust, colorful, and accurate image with plenty of brightness for a typical home office. The lack of features like HDR might seem disappointing but, at this price, it&rsquo;s better to execute the basics well.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1930322/asus-zenscreen-mb249c-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAsus ZenScreen MB249C review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ad page-ad has-ad-prefix ad-article\"></div>\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-to-look-for-in-a-home-office-monitor\">What to look for in a home office monitor</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A great home office monitor should have a high maximum brightness, great image clarity, and vivid color. A height adjustable stand is preferable, as it helps with ergonomics, and a wide range of connectivity is useful for connecting multiple devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"resolution-matters-but-1080p-is-still-fine\">Resolution matters, but 1080p is still fine</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>4K is the best resolution in most situations, as it provides a sharper image and can make small fonts easier to read. This remains a premium option, however: Most 4K monitors are still above $300. A 27-inch 4K monitor has a pixel density of 163 pixels per inch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The less well-known 1440p resolution (2560&times;1440) is a good option for mid-range monitors. It&rsquo;s not quite as sharp as 4K, but it&rsquo;s a noticeable upgrade over 1080p. A 27-inch 1440p monitor has a pixel density of 108 pixels per inch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1080p resolution remains a good pick for budget monitors. It&rsquo;s not nearly as sharp as 4K, so video may look a bit soft and small fonts may be harder to read, but it&rsquo;s still adequate for hundreds of home office tasks. A 27-inch 1080p monitor has a pixel density of 81 pixels per inch.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"when-it-comes-to-brightness-more-is-more\">When it comes to brightness, more is more</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Brightness is a key trait for a home office monitor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An office monitor doesn&rsquo;t need to be bright to look usable: 200 nits is fine. However, a home office is likely to be brighter and to have less light control than a corporate cubical. A maximum brightness of 300 nits, or better, is ideal. You can always turn the brightness down from its maximum if it looks too bright but, of course, the reverse isn&rsquo;t true.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"make-sure-you-understand-connectivity\">Make sure you understand connectivity</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to buy a monitor that supports a video output found on your PC. Most desktop computers will offer both DisplayPort and HDMI, while laptops often stick to HDMI. Budget home monitors sometimes support older connections, such as VGA and DVI, but these are not found on new computers. <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/512092/pcworld_giant_display_cable_guide.html\">Our guide to display cables</a> can help you identify the ports on your PC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You only need one video connection between your PC and your home office monitor, and the type of connection you use isn&rsquo;t terribly important. HDMI and DisplayPort work equally well for home office use.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"usb-c-isnt-a-must-have-but-its-useful\">USB-C isn&rsquo;t a must-have, but it&rsquo;s useful</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>USB-C with DisplayPort Alternate Mode is a new alternative to HDMI and DisplayPort. It bundles a DisplayPort connection into the familiar USB-C port now used by many devices (<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1341415/europe-sets-deadline-for-usb-c-charging-for-almost-all-laptops.html\">and soon to be required by law in Europe</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some high-end laptops, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/825567/dell-xps-13-plus-9320-review.html\">like the Dell XPS 13 Plus</a>, only support video output over USB-C. You can still connect a DisplayPort monitor with a USB-C to DisplayPort cable adapter, but this is a clunky solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>USB-C, unlike HDMI and DisplayPort, can support Power Delivery to charge a connected device. This is useful for thin-and-light laptops, as it makes docking the laptop easier. Some USB-C monitors, like the Dell U3223QE, have built-in USB-C hubs that connect to multiple USB-A ports, ethernet, and DisplayPort-out. <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/612470/you-should-buy-a-usb-c-hub-monitor-heres-what-you-need-to-know.html\">Our guide to USB-C hub monitors</a> has the full scoop on these perks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-we-test-monitors\">How we test monitors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>PCWorld&rsquo;s monitor reviews rely on in-depth testing by a team of staff and freelance writers. Our experts spend hundreds of hours testing and comparing monitors to find the best choice for any budget.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We test monitors with a SpyderXElite color calibration tool. This provides objective measurements for brightness, contrast, color accuracy, color temperature, gamma, and color gamut, among other metrics. These objective metrics help us compare dozens of monitors at once and eliminate bias from comparisons.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-block faq-block\"><h2 class=\"faq-block-title\" id=\"faq\"> FAQ </h2><hr class=\"block-horizotal-divider\" />\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">1.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-makes-a-monitor-good-for-my-home-office\">What makes a monitor good for my home office?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>A home office monitor should have a high maximum brightness, which helps defeat glare, and a good range of connectivity.

Dell is certainly familiar with the tactic, as an Australian government agency just fined the company millions of dollars for deceptive markdowns on PC monitors. In some cases the &ldquo;discount&rdquo; price wasn&rsquo;t just a fib in relation to the actual retail price, it was <em>higher </em>than the same monitor bought in another section of Dell&rsquo;s online store. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission, Dell pushed customers to purchase monitors &ldquo;bundled&rdquo; with new desktops, with a crossed-out price next to a sale price indicating (if not actually stating) that the buyers were getting a discount on the screens at checkout. On the contrary, not only were the original prices and discounts overstated, in some cases customers would have saved money if they&rsquo;d bought the monitors separately. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This practice violates portions of Australian Consumer Law, and the ACCC has demanded Dell pay a $6.5 million fine, in addition to repaying customers as already ordered. In total, computer buyers spent $2 million Australian dollars on monitors via the deceptive practice. In a statement, a Dell spokesperson said that the whole thing was &ldquo;an error in Dell&rsquo;s pricing process.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/dell-fined-6-5m-after-admitting-it-made-overpriced-monitors-look-discounted/&amp;xcust=2-1-2031959-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Ars Technica notes</a>, this kind of flim-flammery is hardly unique to Dell, though Australia&rsquo;s particular consumer protection laws have caught the company with its proverbial pants down. Deceptive discount labeling has become commonplace in online shopping, particularly around large sales events like Black Friday or Amazon&rsquo;s self-styled Prime Day. Some computer vendors are especially fond of the practice. Lenovo laptops are almost never seen at their &ldquo;retail price&rdquo; on the company&rsquo;s online store, with frequent alleged discounts of hundreds of dollars bringing ThinkPads and IdeaPads down to their more realistic regular prices. </p>\n\nMonitors</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2031959/dell-is-in-hot-water-down-under-for-deceptive-monitor-pricing.html", "date_published": "2023-08-15T18:53:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Cherry KW 9200 Mini review: A stylish, compact, and practical keyboard", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n<div class=\"review\" id=\"review-body\"><span class=\"review-title\">At a glance</span><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"experts-rating\">Expert's Rating</h3><div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n<div><div class=\"review-columns\"><div class=\"review-column\"><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"pros\">Pros</h3><ul class=\"pros review-list\"><li>Small</li><li>Hybrid</li><li>Up to 3 connections</li></ul></div><div class=\"review-column\"><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"cons\">Cons</h3><ul class=\"cons review-list\"><li>Price</li><li>No Mac version</li></ul></div></div></div><h3 class=\"review-subTitle review-subTitle--borderTop\" id=\"our-verdict\">Our Verdict</h3><p class=\"verdict\">Stylish, compact, practical, hybrid &ndash; that&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;d describe and sum up Cherry&rsquo;s KW 9200 Mini keyboard.

Let&rsquo;s take a look at what it looks like, its capabilities and value for money. It might just be the one you&rsquo;ve been looking for.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading toc\" id=\"design\">Design</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Minimalist design</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lightweight</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Carrying case included</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This Cherry external keyboard lives up to its &lsquo;mini&rsquo; name by measuring just 295.49 x 129.03 x 15.86 mm; its small size means it can easily find a place in your backpack or handbag for that matter, as well as on your desk, and follow you wherever you go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s discreet in terms of its size, but also in terms of its style: it&rsquo;s simply black on a red background, as are the USB-A outputs and the storage pouch. It makes an impact, but it&rsquo;s not too eye-catching.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, although this color scheme is reminiscent of a gamer&rsquo;s style, the keys are not backlit (which is a shame).</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"test KW 9200 MINI\" class=\"wp-image-2010696\" height=\"550\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IMG_20230727_090305.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>What we really like about the design is that the black keys don&rsquo;t show fingerprints.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the back, you&rsquo;ll find two feet to raise it up, three glides to keep it from slipping off surfaces, a dongle (inserted in its port) to provide a 2.4 GHz radio connection, a USB port for its cable, an LED to indicate the state of the battery, and finally the power button.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter\"><div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container\"><ul class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper\"><li class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide\"><figure><img alt=\"test KW 9200 MINI\" class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-2010719\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/clavier-KW-9200-MINI2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" /></figure></li><li class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide\"><figure><img alt=\"test KW 9200 MINI\" class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-2010699\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IMG_20230727_145049.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" /></figure></li><li class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide\"><figure><img alt=\"KW 9200 MINI test\" class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-2010692\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IMG_20230705_143142.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" /></figure></li><li class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide\"><figure><img alt=\"test KW 9200 MINI\" class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-2010693\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IMG_20230727_145629.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" /></figure></li></ul><a class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white\"></a><a class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white\"></a><a class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause\"></a><div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white\"></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>We especially liked the fact that the black keys don&rsquo;t retain fingerprints</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To achieve this small size, Cherry has dispensed with the numeric keypad and moved the FN key to the bottom right-hand corner near the direction arrows, so that you don&rsquo;t get lost when changing keyboards (from full to compact).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, Cherry has provided a soft, recycled plastic case for you to store it neatly or take it with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading toc\" id=\"use\">Use</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Multi-platform connection</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hybrid connection (dongle, Bluetooth and wired)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Quiet, comfortable typing</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To sum up the use of the KW 9200 Mini, we&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s simple and effective, nothing more. In fact, this office keyboard comes with no software to provide additional functions. Its only specific features are its smaller size and its connections/compatibilities.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"Test KW 9200 MINI\" class=\"wp-image-2010683\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IMG_20230727_145411.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"938\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Case, dongle and cable</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>However, we must stress that we greatly appreciated the fact that it can be used with Windows and Chromebook computers, and even Android device, according to the brand. If you have a Mac, you&rsquo;ll have to adapt as the Cmd key isn&rsquo;t there.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>The keys are spaced far enough apart to deliver a short, precise and consistent typing experience, equivalent to that of a conventional keyboard</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, we welcome the fact that it can be paired with up to three devices simultaneously. This is a major advantage, and a very practical one if you often switch from one connected device to another. In our test, this was a little tricky, but only at first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;d rather avoid the 2.4 GHz waves and connections with the dongle and Bluetooth 5.0 low latency, then you&rsquo;ll be pleased to know that there&rsquo;s the wired method. Its cable is an alternative, but also allows you to make up for the (sudden) lack of battery power. It&rsquo;s a good length (over a meter), which is long enough to be optimal in all circumstances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You won&rsquo;t be dealing with a noisy scissor keyboard, so your typing will be pretty quiet, at about the same noise level as that of a laptop&rsquo;s built-in keyboard. This is due to the type of keyboard: this is a chiclet (rubber) keyboard rather than a mechanical one, and its <em>keycaps</em> are made of ABS plastic (which is softer and more durable). So don&rsquo;t worry about using the Mini in the office/home, in a train carriage, a caf&eacute; or a public library, you won&rsquo;t disturb the people around you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The keys are spaced far enough apart to give you a short, precise, even keystroke that&rsquo;s the same as on a conventional keyboard. It&rsquo;s quick and easy to adapt. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading toc\" id=\"battery-life-and-charging\">Battery life and charging</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Sensational battery life </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Charges via USB-C</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cherry KW 9200 Mini rounds off its list of good points with a long battery life, including the absence of backlighting. This keyboard can last you several weeks without recharging. However, even when it runs out of power (as indicated by the LED), it won&rsquo;t abandon you, as you can rely on its USB-C/A cable. Just plug it into your PC or a backup battery and you&rsquo;re back in business!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading toc\" id=\"price-and-availability\">Price and availability</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cherry KW 9200 Mini keyboard costs about $65/&pound;70 and is available in the US from <a href=\"http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=14154&amp;GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Cherry-Rechargable-Keyboard-Bluetooth-Connectivity/dp/B0BXBC95X5/?ascsubtag=2-1-2031623-1-0-0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, and in the UK also from <a href=\"http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=14154&amp;GR_URL=https://www.amazon.co.uk/CHERRY-multi-device-connection-Bluetooth%C2%AE-rechargeable/dp/B0BX99SLSX/?ascsubtag=2-1-2031623-1-0-0\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amazon</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our opinion the price is a little too steep for a simple device with no software customization. In comparison, the <a href=\"http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=14154&amp;GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-K380-Multi-Device-Bluetooth-Keyboard/dp/B0148NPH9I?ascsubtag=2-1-2031623-1-0-0\" rel=\"nofollow\">Logitech K380</a> and <a href=\"http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=14154&amp;GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Bluetooth-Multi-Device-Keyboard-K480/dp/B00MUTWLW4?ascsubtag=2-1-2031623-1-0-0\" rel=\"nofollow\">K480</a> are currently priced similarly. On the other hand, it&rsquo;s worth noting that Apple&rsquo;s Magic Keyboard, exclusive for use with Macs, is more expensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading toc\" id=\"verdict\">Verdict</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cherry has come up with a superb mini-sized office keyboard, ideal for travelling. It&rsquo;s got everything: design, comfort, connections, compatibility and battery life. Nevertheless, there are a few minor disappointments, such as the lack of backlighting for use in low-light environments, the lack of a macOS version with the Cmd key, and the high price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Admittedly, it&rsquo;s a good device, but it&rsquo;s a simple one with no additional functions, which makes it hard to justify its cost, even though it&rsquo;s lower than the Magic Keyboard, for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"specs\">Specs</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>442g</li>\n\n\n\n<li>295.49 x 129.03 x 15.86 mm</li>\n\n\n\n<li>USB-C to USB-A</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Scissor technology</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Bluetooth, wired and encrypted 2.4 GHz radio connection via dongle</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Carrying case</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article was originally published in French on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techadvisor.com/article/2010623/test-cherry-kw-9200-mini.html&amp;xcust=2-1-2031623-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Tech Advisor French Edition</a></em>.</p>\n\nComputer Accessories, Keyboards, Laptop Accessories</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2031623/cherry-kw-9200-mini-review-a-stylish-compact-and-practical-keyboard.html", "date_published": "2023-08-15T18:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "TL;DR: Google is adding AI web page summaries to Chrome", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Google is bringing one element of its AI-powered &ldquo;Search Generative Experience&rdquo; (SGE) to Google Chrome, following in the footsteps of Microsoft and its migration of Bing Chat into Edge and mainstream search experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google calls this &ldquo;SGE while browsing,&rdquo; but that&rsquo;s an overly complex way of putting it.

Unfortunately, many of its benefits are lost by the inexplicable omission of a manual that explains it all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially, this is a USB-C hub for nerds. Not only is the hub larger than most, with multiple external connectors that designate a premium hub, but there&rsquo;s an actual display: a small LCD screen that provides a detailed look at what devices are connected to each port and what their capabilities are. Put another way, the Dockcase Smart USB-C Hub 10-in-1 feels more like a an OBD2 diagnostic device for your car, or a USB multimeter. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s also a decent USB-C hub by itself, powering two 4K displays at 60Hz without the need for Thunderbolt. More on that in a minute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a USB-C hub, the Dockcase Smart USB-C Hub 10-in-1 connects to your PC via a braided USB-C cable that&rsquo;s about a foot long. There are two display ports: an undisclosed HDMI port capable of powering an 8K display at 30Hz or a 4K display at 60Hz, and an undisclosed DisplayPort capable of driving a 4K/120Hz display. There&rsquo;s also two 480Mbps USB-A ports, a 10Gbps USB-C port, a 10Gbps USB-A port, gigabit Ethernet, and a UHS-II SD/microSD card slot rated at 312Mbps. A dedicated USB-C power-in port accepts up to 100W. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The square central multicolor display measures about 1.2 inches on a side, and the top is made out of clear plastic, allowing you to see the internal electronics powering the hub.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Plug in your laptop&rsquo;s charger, and the Dockcase device reports how many watts are being supplied, how many watts being consumed by the dock, and how much is available to power your laptop &mdash; <em>and</em> allows you to make adjustments.</p></blockquote></figure>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Dockcase 10-in-1 USB-C hub \" class=\"wp-image-2022637\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Dockcase-front.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The front of the Dockcase Smart USB-C Hub 10-in-1 Explorer Edition is controlled by the small black button to the left. The 480Mbps USB-A port is color-coded, distinguishing it from the faster 5Gbps blue port.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the right PC, this dock can accomplish the same capabilities as a more expensive Thunderbolt dock, powering two 4K displays at 60Hz. It uses a technology called USB 3.2 Gen 2+DP Alt Mode with HBR3, which uses compression technology to approximate a Thunderbolt stream. Dockcase says that this dock will accommodate most Windows laptops but not all Microsoft Surface devices, without explaining which ones. But it certainly worked on our test PCs, which included a Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-buy-a-dockcase-hub-the-display\">Why buy a Dockcase hub? The display</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The display, though, is the selling point. For someone who already struggles to (briefly) explain the differences between <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/402858/the-best-usb-c-hubs-for-your-laptop-tablet-or-2-in-1.html\">the best USB-C hubs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/393714/best-thunderbolt-docks-for-a-laptop-pc.html\">the best Thunderbolt docks</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/801587/why-new-usb-c-displaylink-docks-are-better-and-worse-than-thunderbolt.html\">what a DisplayLink dock is</a>, I find a hub that tries to explain what your system is doing via the diagnostic screen a real winner. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plug in an HDMI cable, and the dock&rsquo;s display reports what device is plugged in, its resolution, and display rate. Plug in your laptop&rsquo;s charger, and the Dockcase device reports how many watts are being supplied, how many watts being consumed by the dock, and how much is available to power your laptop &mdash; <em>and</em> allows you to make adjustments. If you&rsquo;d like to push more power to the dock to supply more output power to an SSD, you can do that. You can adjust USB speeds. A small indicator will even display the dock&rsquo;s internal temperature. (Previous Dockcase docks included cooling fans; this does not.) </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Dockcase 10-in-1 USB-C hub Explorer Edition\" class=\"wp-image-2022635\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Dockcase-detail.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=804\" width=\"804\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">If you want detail, the Dockcase Smart USB-C Hub 10-in-1 can provide it.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>This sounds fantastic, and it is. But there are two major hangups: The interface, and the lack of a manual explaining the ins and outs of the Dockcase Smart USB-C Hub 10-in-1 Explorer Edition. Navigating through the complex menu system is all done by a single button and a complex combination of short key presses, long key presses, and holding down the key for even longer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s not clear what does what, and I found myself fruitlessly looking for a support site, a manual, <em>anything</em>, either in the box or on the Dockcase site. Earlier Dockcase products on Amazon suggested how to navigate around, but what I learned about my PC via the Dockcase 10-in-1 USB-C hub was largely through trial and error, and that simply shouldn&rsquo;t happen. There were settings I simply didn&rsquo;t have the patience to test, if only because a) I didn&rsquo;t know what they would do, and b) at least once I ended up in a menu I couldn&rsquo;t back out of. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before this review published, Dockcase did send over a manual as a Google Docs document, which we won&rsquo;t link to here. That&rsquo;s not helpful for a consumer, however, and Dockcase really needs to publish a direct link or printed manual. It doesn&rsquo;t solve the navigation issue, but it does show there&rsquo;s a lot of value inside this hub, waiting to be unlocked.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-does-the-dockcase-hub-perform\">How does the Dockcase hub perform?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Dockcase USB-C Smart Hub 10-in-1 dock was generally stable once in use. But plugging things in and configuring them was another story. One display went black after switching a tab. My test displays also took a few seconds to connect, longer than most. Both external displays also went black for a few seconds when I plugged in an Ethernet cable to speed up a local file transfer. While the hub showed the Ethernet cable as connected, Windows didn&rsquo;t. (Resetting the Ethernet adapter via Windows solved the problem, but transferring the file via Wi-Fi proved more effective.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I saw some instability when testing performance, too. The Dockcase dock easily outperformed rival docks in terms of storage transfers over the shared bus, about 10MB/s, or faster than its rivals, or 138.9Mbps. While doing so, however, one 4K display essentially de-rezzed into what appeared to be a sort of semi-random representation of the screen. Unplugging and reinserting the cable solved the problem. I also experienced a glitch where plugging the hub into my PC didn&rsquo;t work. In this case, give Dockcase credit: I&rsquo;ve experienced this same glitch before with other hubs, and the Dockcase dock identified it and asked me to unplug and reinsert the USB-C cable. That&rsquo;s good.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Dockcase 10-in-1 USB-C hub \" class=\"wp-image-2022636\" height=\"620\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Dockcase-back.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The rear of the Dockcase 10-in-1 Smart USB-C Hub, with its two high-speed display ports next to a USB-C charger port and a conventional USB-A port and gigabit Ethernet.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I next played back a 4K YouTube video over Wi-Fi and it went flawlessly, even when I was transferring files over the bus at the same time. That&rsquo;s atypical, and a credit to the Dockcase hub.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The USB-C port generated about 6.5W of power, not really enough to fast-charge a smartphone. The USB-A ports produced about 2.5W of power. Thoough the Dockcase dock appears to be made of aluminum and plastic, heat was never an issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Dockcase Smart USB-C Hub 10-in-1 Explorer Edition is a fun, geeky dock that tells you what&rsquo;s going on under the hood of your PC and its peripherals, but it&rsquo;s up to you to figure it all out.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"should-you-buy-the-dockcase-smart-usb-c-hub-10-in-1-explorer-edition\">Should you buy the Dockcase Smart USB-C Hub 10-in-1 Explorer Edition? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dockcase has a slightly unusual way of launching new products: first via Kickstarter, then later on its own website and through third-party retailers. (Its 9-in-1 Visual Smart USB-C Hub with a single HDMI port, launched in 2022, is currently <a href=\"http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=14154&amp;GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/DOCKCASE-Delivery-Gigabit-Ethernet-MacBook/dp/B0B7WQJ5H6?ascsubtag=2-1-2020975-1-0-0\" rel=\"nofollow\">available on Amazon for $99.99</a>.) For now, the only available purchasing links to buy this 10-in-1 hub are via Kickstarter, where the product&rsquo;s price has been cut by about a third to $109, versus an expected retail price of $159.99.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you look at the Dockcase 10-in-1 hub as offering the capabilities of a Thunderbolt dock while adding information/diagnostic capabilities on top of it, this Dockcase dock is a relative bargain at its Kickstarter price. From experience, you&rsquo;ll have better luck with all USB-C hardware &mdash; and not just this dock &mdash; if you connect it to a modern laptop (with, say, a 12th-gen Core or above) that&rsquo;s been tested against Intel&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/560732/intel-expands-premium-evo-brand-into-desktops-foldables-and-more.html\">Evo program</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bottom line: The Dockcase Smart USB-C Hub 10-in-1 Explorer Edition is a fun, geeky USB-C hub that tells you some of what&rsquo;s going on with your USB peripherals in real time. But you won&rsquo;t be able to take full advantage until Dockcase brings its documentation up to speed.</p>\n\nComputer Accessories</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2020975/dockcase-10-in-1-usb-c-dock-review.html", "date_published": "2023-08-15T16:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "LTX interview: Are pre-built PCs worth it?", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Ask any PC nerd how to get the best deal on a gaming desktop, and you&rsquo;ll get pretty much the same answer: build it yourself.

And as an experienced builder in his own right, he knows what he&rsquo;s talking about, and we got to pick his brain at the Linux Tech Expo 2023. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So what makes a good pre-built PC, according to Braethorn? It comes down to two things: the configuration, and the experience. A good pre-built has a specific selection of parts for a specific task, be that gaming, video editing, or an all-round budget build. You wouldn&rsquo;t pair a top-of-the-line CPU with a budget GPU&hellip;and neither should a pre-built vendor. The experience part of it is things like the fit and finish, as evidenced by <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.falcon-nw.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-2029936-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Falcon Northwest</a>&lsquo;s custom-made enclosures, customer service, and warranty. You&rsquo;ll pay extra for it (as you <em>always </em>will for pre-builts), but the peace of mind and time savings might just be worth it for the right buyer. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><strong>Further reading: </strong><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/813362/best-pc-computer-deals.html\">Best PC computer deals, from desktops to all-in-ones</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>But even buyers who never want to crack open their PCs need to do a little homework. Make sure you&rsquo;re getting the parts that actually meet your requirements, no matter what you&rsquo;re paying. For example, many budget pre-built PCs will start with an option for 512GB of M.2 SSD storage. And 512GB might sound like a lot&hellip;but with new PC game installations coming in at 100 gigabytes or more, that drive will get filled up in no time. So the savings aren&rsquo;t really worth it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more insights on how to get the best build from a system integrator, check out <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/@braethorn&amp;xcust=2-1-2029936-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Braethorn&rsquo;s channel</a>.

Amazon&rsquo;s currently selling the <a href=\"http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=14154&amp;GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-5-button-circulating-backlight-intuitive-GX30P93886/dp/B076GZ3CFC?ascsubtag=2-1-2031466-1-0-0\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lenovo Legion M200 wired gaming mouse for just $9.49</a>, which is a whopping 62 percent off of the original price. This peripheral has five programmable buttons, a braided cable, and seven circulating backlight colors augmenting a radically futuristic aesthetic.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Lenovo Legion M200 features a maximum DPI of 2,400, a frame rate of 500 fps, and an ambidextrous design. It&rsquo;s not the fastest gaming mouse we&rsquo;ve ever seen here at PCWorld, but that&rsquo;s OK. Personally, I prefer a lower DPI, as it allows me to have better control over the mouse. Anything higher than 2,500 and things get messy. According to Amazon buyers, the mouse is easy to set up and it feels quite good to use. Plus, that futuristic aesthetic is pretty neat!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one catch? According to Amazon, it ships within one to two months, which is a long time. If you&rsquo;re willing to spend a little more and get the mouse faster, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/accessories-and-software/keyboards-and-mice/mice/gx30p93886&amp;xcust=2-1-2031466-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lenovo&rsquo;s selling it for $19.99</a>, which is 20 percent off and still a rocking deal for a gaming mouse like this.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"cta wp-block wp-block-button\"><a class=\"cta__btn\" href=\"http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=14154&amp;GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-5-button-circulating-backlight-intuitive-GX30P93886/dp/B076GZ3CFC?ascsubtag=2-1-2031466-7-0-0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Get the Lenovo Legion M200 gaming mouse for $9.49 at Amazon</a></p>\nMice</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2031466/2031466.html", "date_published": "2023-08-15T14:33:45+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Dropbox review: Still the best at syncing and sharing", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n<div class=\"review\" id=\"review-body\"><span class=\"review-title\">At a glance</span><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"experts-rating\">Expert's Rating</h3><div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n<div><div class=\"review-columns\"><div class=\"review-column\"><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"pros\">Pros</h3><ul class=\"pros review-list\"><li>Synchronisation is best in class</li><li>Easy to share content with others</li><li>File history</li></ul></div><div class=\"review-column\"><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"cons\">Cons</h3><ul class=\"cons review-list\"><li>No option between 2GB and 2TB</li><li>The free account only allows three devices</li><li>No bonus features for consumers</li></ul></div></div></div><h3 class=\"review-subTitle review-subTitle--borderTop\" id=\"our-verdict\">Our Verdict</h3><p class=\"verdict\">Are you looking for cloud storage primarily to share files with others so you can both access and edit them?

The feature was almost like magic when it first appeared and millions of people signed up for Dropbox accounts and started syncing and sharing folders. Since then, the company has acquired a few companies and built a portfolio of business-oriented features like document signing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The basic functionality of Dropbox still works as smoothly as ever, and none of its competitors have managed to do synchronization and shared folder access quite as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Free accounts only get two gigabytes of space, but can increase that by inviting others to get Dropbox accounts. With 32 invitees, you get an extra 16 gigabytes, and if you also go through the company&rsquo;s getting started guide, you get the maximum free space of 18.25 gigabytes. That&rsquo;s more than the competition but also requires a lot of work. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s your only option if two gigabytes is too little but you feel like you really don&rsquo;t need the two terabytes, which you get with a subscription to Dropbox Plus.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Dropbox\" class=\"wp-image-1821688\" height=\"836\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/kontextmeny.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Dropbox&rsquo;s biggest drawback is just that: The lack of an intermediate subscription with somewhere between 50 and a few hundred gigabytes. With Apple, Google, and Microsoft, you can get 50, 100, or 200 gigabytes for between $1 and $3 a month, while Dropbox swoops in with its two terabytes for $9.99 a month. Users have complained to no avail, but Dropbox doesn&rsquo;t seem to find it profitable to offer a smaller subscription.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"business-orientated\">Business-orientated</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the basics, Dropbox offers a bunch of extra features, but almost all of them are aimed at businesses and many are only included in business subscriptions. One feature available in consumer subscriptions is automatic backup of both internal and external discs. The Dropbox backup feature uses a separate part of the available space that you can&rsquo;t access directly from, say, Windows Explorer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means you can use Dropbox as a cloud backup like Backblaze and at the same time for file sync, thus avoiding the need for another subscription. However, this requires that all your files fit into less than two terabytes (Backblaze, by comparison, has unlimited space for backups).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, Dropbox is still a very good service for keeping files synchronized between different devices and users. If you can unlock the extra space in a free account, you get a reasonably spacious cloud folder that quickly and securely syncs the most important files to all your devices. If you pay for a subscription, you or the whole family gets a large cloud folder that can be used very flexibly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"facts\">Facts:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tested: </strong>2023<br /><strong>Manufacturer:</strong> Dropbox<br /><strong>Platforms </strong>: Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, IOS<br /><strong>Free account space</strong>: 2 GB (plus up to 16.25 GB in rewards)<br /><strong>Storage space: </strong>2 GB, 2 TB<br /><strong>Monthly price: </strong>Free, $9.99 (personal), $16.99 (family up to 6 users)<br /><strong>Synchronization of optional files and folders: </strong>Yes<br /><strong>Family sharing</strong>: Up to six people with family plan<br /><strong>Backup function:</strong> Yes, complete<br /><strong>File history</strong>: Yes (30 days)<br /><strong>Other features </strong>: Various business features</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This review originally appeared on pcforallse and was translated from Swedish to English.</em></p>\n\nAndroid, iOS, Mac, Storage, Windows</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2020875/dropbox-still-the-best-at-syncing-and-sharing.html", "date_published": "2023-08-15T14:30:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Windows 11: How to activate efficiency mode for specific programs", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Windows 11&rsquo;s &ldquo;22H2&rdquo; update added the option to manually set individual applications into Efficiency Mode. This setting allows you to lower the process priority of a program so that it runs more often in the background and thus more energy efficiently. Activating the feature is simple, though it isn&rsquo;t quite so easy to find unless you know where to look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Efficiency Mode is primarily recommended for applications with high resource requirements that you often keep open for a long time without using them constantly, such as an address database or videoconferencing software. Please note, however, that according to Microsoft, Efficiency mode can make some applications unstable. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Windows 11 task manager efficiency mode\" class=\"wp-image-2031490\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/efficiency-mode.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><p>With the efficiency mode of Windows 11, you can reduce the energy consumption of your computer by assigning a lower process priority to applications.</p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>To switch on the Efficiency mode, first open the Windows 11 Task Manager. Right-click on the Windows Start button and select &ldquo;Task Manager&rdquo; or press the key combination Ctrl-Alt-Del. Make sure you are in the &ldquo;Processes&rdquo; tab and right-click on a process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Select &ldquo;Efficiency Mode&rdquo; to activate the energy-saving mode. Don&rsquo;t be surprised: For some applications (such as Windows Explorer, Microsoft Defender Antivirus, and Google Chrome) the entry is greyed out and inaccessible.

The icon categories ranges from <em>Analysis</em> to <em>Holidays</em>, with the smileys in the <em>Faces</em> section. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading toc\" id=\"create-your-own-watermark\">Create your own watermark</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"Word watermark\" class=\"wp-image-2019183\" height=\"834\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/watermark.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Problem: </strong>Watermarks are a common method of making it clear who owns the copyrights to a document or of preventing the unwanted use of copies. Can Word do this too?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Microsoft has hidden the function for inserting a watermark in its word processor a little: You will find it in the menu bar under the <em>Design</em> tab&mdash;select <em>Watermark</em> on the far right. Here the watermark menu offers some ready-made watermarks such as &ldquo;Confidential&rdquo; or &ldquo;Do not copy.&rdquo; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To use your own design, click on <em>Custom watermark&hellip;</em> and add the logo or text you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading toc\" id=\"templates-and-designs-integrated-layout-aids\">Templates and designs: Integrated layout aids</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Word calendar\" class=\"wp-image-2019188\" height=\"833\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Calendar.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><p>In addition to the locally installed Word templates, many more are available online. The illustration shows this using the example of various calendar layouts.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Problem: </strong>With ordinary text, you just start writing, but when it comes to sophisticated layouts such as calendars, invitations, or CVs, designing with Word quickly becomes tedious. Can&rsquo;t you get help so that you don&rsquo;t have to start from scratch every time?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solution: </strong>Word helps on two levels. The first is when you create a new document. In addition to <em>Blank Document</em>, there are numerous templates available, such as letterheads, certificates, and brochures. If the selection is not sufficient, simply enter a keyword for the required template in the search field. The search term &ldquo;calendar,&rdquo; for example, brings up dozens of online templates that can be used as the basis for your own works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second level, on the other hand, is more concerned with the appearance of documents. The corresponding function can be found under <em>Design </em>in the <em>Themes</em> menu. Here Microsoft combines coordinated fonts, colors, and font sizes. If you move the mouse pointer over a design, you can see how your document would look with it before you select it with a click.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"microsoft-office-365-home\">Microsoft Office 365 Home</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Microsoft Office 365 Home\" class=\"product-widget__image\" src=\"https://pricespy-75b8.kxcdn.com/product/standard/800/1639969.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__pricing-details  \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07F3TQ6DQ?tag=pcworld02-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;xcust=2-1-2009518-5-1537496-10994&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$69.99 at  Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading toc\" id=\"microsoft-365-insert-text-content-without-formatting\">Microsoft 365: Insert text content without formatting</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Instead of inserting texts in the font and with the formatting of the target document, Word insists on copying texts in the source format, but this often ruins the layout and results in costly corrections. Is there a way to insert texts without taking over their formatting?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Windows has actually known a solution to this problem for a long time: The key combination <strong>Ctrl-Shift-V</strong> copies pure text information in many programs. But Microsoft&rsquo;s Office package, of all things, cannot do this. Instead, users have to remove the formatting from texts inserted with Ctrl-V in a second step. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply paste your text into the target document using <strong>Ctrl+V</strong>, then from the little paste menu that appears, choose the third option for text-only.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading toc\" id=\"protect-documents-with-a-password\">Protect documents with a password</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Word password protect\" class=\"wp-image-2019191\" height=\"685\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Word-password-protect.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><p>You can protect Word documents from unauthorized access by entering a password. If they are protected in this way, they cannot be opened, changed, or printed.</p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Problem: </strong>If you send private or confidential documents by email, for example, you should protect them from prying eyes with a password. How can this be done?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solution: </strong>In the case of secret business documents or personal documents with private information, it makes sense to protect the contents of Word documents with a password. This makes the file worthless to foreign eyes, because without entering the correct password, the file can neither be read nor changed or printed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To password-protect a document, go to <em>File &gt; Info &gt; Protect document &gt; Encrypt with password</em>. Here you enter the password twice and then save the document to activate the protection. The encryption also applies to alternative programs such as Libre Office.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to remove the password protection, click on <em>Encrypt with password</em> and remove all characters from the password field. After clicking on &ldquo;OK&rdquo;, the password prompt is removed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><br />Create an automatic directory</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Problem:</strong> In long documents with numerous graphic elements, it is worthwhile to insert an automatic list of illustrations. How does this work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solution: </strong>The automatic list of illustrations requires two steps. In the first step, you provide all images with a caption. To do this, click on the first illustration and then go to the menu bar item <em>References</em> at the top&mdash;in some Word versions it is also called <em>Links</em>. Click on <em>Insert caption</em> and in the dialog window under <em>Options</em> set whether the selected object is an figure, equation, or table.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <em>Position</em> tab determines whether the caption should appear above or below the image. Enter the caption text in the <em>Caption</em> field at the top and confirm by clicking on <em>OK</em>. Proceed in the same way with the other images. Word automatically recognizes the order of the pictures and assigns them the correct numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the second step, insert the list of illustrations. To do this, click on the place in the document where you want it to appear later and then click on <em>Insert Table of Figures</em> in the <em>References</em> menu in the <em>Captions</em> section. Here you can again distinguish between figure, equation, and table in the <em>General</em> section and in this way also create an equation or table directory. Under <em>Formats</em> you can choose from several designs for the list of figures. A click on <em>OK</em> completes the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to update the list later, for example because new illustrations have been added or the page numbers have changed in the meantime, simply click on it and in the menu on the function <em>Update list of illustrations</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading toc\" id=\"transcription-of-audio-files-into-text\">Transcription of audio files into text</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Word transcription\" class=\"wp-image-2020808\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Word-transcription.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><p>The automatic transcription of an audio file into text works quite well in practice, but has limitations with certain dialects and languages.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Problem: </strong>In the age of videoconferencing, it is sometimes quite useful to transfer the content into a document. But listening and typing is tedious. Can such transcription be done automatically with Word?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solution:</strong> The paid version of Microsoft 365 allows you to do just that, it transcribes texts from an audio or video file directly into a Word document. Microsoft 365 allows five hours of transcription per user account per month, whereas the locally installed Word version only offers the dictation function, not the transcription function.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This is how it works: </strong>Go to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://www.office.com&amp;xcust=2-1-2009518-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">www.office.com</a> in your browser and log in with your Microsoft 365 account. Create an empty document, open the microphone menu in the <em>Home</em> menu and switch to <em>Transcribe</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A new column opens on the right-hand side. At the top, set the language in which the video or audio file is available. At the bottom of the column is the information on how many of the 300 free minutes you have already used in the current month. Then click on <em>Upload audio</em>. Word supports the audio formats WAV, MP4, M4A, and MP3 and file sizes up to 300MB.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The upload and transcription take a while, depending on the internet bandwidth. Word then displays the texts in the right-hand column with speaker number and time stamps. If you move the mouse pointer over one of the entries, a pencil symbol appears for editing. Rough mistakes can be ironed out right here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to hear a text passage again in the original, simply click on the corresponding timestamp. Word will now play back the recording from this point. To add all paragraphs to the document, click on <em>Add to document</em>. In addition to the pure text, there is also the option to take over the speakers, the time stamps or both.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading toc\" id=\"faster-with-text-modules\">Faster with text modules</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Problem: </strong>Frequently used text modules, such as addresses, disclaimers, or greetings, have to be typed in again and again. Can&rsquo;t Word do the work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Frequently used text modules can be stored as so-called autotext. For example, instead of typing &ldquo;Yours sincerely&rdquo; over and over again, select the words and press the key combination <strong>Alt+F3</strong>. The window <em>Create a New Building Block</em> appears. In the <em>Name</em> field, enter an easy-to-remember abbreviation for the text module, such as &ldquo;ys&rdquo; in our example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To insert the greeting formula later, just enter &ldquo;ys&rdquo; and press the F3 key. Word usually saves the text modules in the file normal.dotm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article has been translated from German to English and originally appeared on pcwelt.de.</em></p>\n\nPersonal Software</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2009518/microsoft-word-10-tricks-hidden-functions.html", "date_published": "2023-08-15T10:45:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Get two drones for the price of one: just $150", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever wanted to get into drone piloting, now&rsquo;s the time!
