It's the GameSpot show where the people behind the games you love tell the untold stories of how they were made. This week we're joined by Naoki Yoshida and Hiroshi Takai to discuss how Ifrit, the firey Eikon from Final Fantasy 16 was made. \n\nThe pair discuss the slightly uncool origins of Ifrit and his leather pants, how the over the top battles were designed, and how Yoshida got the idea to turn characters into Eikons from a visit to a packed Tokyo Game Show. \n\nAudio Logs airs every Thursday on GameSpot. Check out our previous episodes on Alan Wake 2, Cyberpunk 2077, and Immortality\n\n#gaming #finalfantasy16 #gamespot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW-lyPnouqs", "date_published": "2023-08-15T15:00:43+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/kW-lyPnouqs/hqdefault.jpg"}]
