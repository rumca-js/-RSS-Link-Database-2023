First timing tests are in but not yet analyzed, however, it doesnt feel too promising at the moment. The process and the prototype does it job perfectly, it will provide the clear answers i need. Its still too early to judge though so will continue the testing process over the upcoming days.

The prototype is designed to answer the age old question: Can I play tight music using a very strong flywheel? The new flywheel have 20x more moment of inertia compared to the MMX Flywheel.

We are recording at the wonderful location of Siegfrieds Mechanical Music Museum in Rudesheim Am Rhein, Germany. The museum will livestream the upcoming Wintergatan meetup 4-6 august on their youtube channel, check it out here: https://www.youtube.com/@Musikkabinett
