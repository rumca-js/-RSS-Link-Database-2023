Survival horror games have been on a hot streak as of late with recent hits like Dead Space Remake, and the future is only looking bright for games of this ilk with upcoming titles like Alan Wake 2 and Silent Hill 2 Remake. But there’s also a slew of upcoming indie games that showcase a ton of promise, and Pine Harbor is one such game. 

Taking place in an abandoned town ravaged by a difficult situation, you must do everything in your power to survive and ultimately find the cure to this disaster. The gameplay isn’t anything revolutionary in terms of mechanics, but it is looking like a solid first-person horror experience that knows what notes to hit and how to play on one’s fear of the unknown. It’s set to release sometime in Q4 2023, and we’re definitely excited to play this one.

So far, 2023 has been the year that keeps on giving, thanks to its consistent stream of high-quality experiences, almost to the point where we’ve barely had the time to reflect and relax on a game before moving on to the next big and excellent thing. That, of course, also means that there’s been plenty over the last few months that a great many people have ended up missing. 

As tightly packed as these last few months have been, there has been no shortage of excellent new games that have come and gone and haven’t nearly received the sort of buzz that they should have, based purely on their quality. Here, we’re going to talk about a few such games that you should probably be paying more attention to.
