However, changing family dynamics are not easy to navigate.

Support for kinship carers, including financial help, should be available regardless of the legal status of the kinship arrangement.</p><p>As a membership organisation, CoramBAAF hears from local authorities about the many challenges they face in assessing and supporting kinship carers in the current legal and policy context. The government\u2019s national kinship strategy is welcome and will increase the focus on kinship care. We hope that this will lead to a legal definition of kinship care and commitment to support. An allowance for all kinship carers is vital, but support needs to be far-reaching and responsive, and meet the needs of both the children and their carers.<br /><strong>Clare Seth</strong><br /><em>Kinship consultant, CoramBAAF</em></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/aug/06/kinship-carers-do-a-vital-job-they-must-get-better-support\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/aug/06/kinship-carers-do-a-vital-job-they-must-get-better-support", "date_published": "2023-08-06T15:20:18+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Tories must show they care about the environment, says Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey", "description": "<p>Environment secretary says party is still committed to net zero, after Sunak\u2019s promise to \u2018max out\u2019 gas and oil reserves</p><p>The Conservative party will lose the next election if it abandons its green policies, the environment secretary has said.</p><p>Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey said the party must show that it cared about the environment and insisted that \u201cdespite the noise over the last week\u201d, the government was still committed to reaching net zero by 2050.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/aug/06/tories-must-show-they-care-about-the-environment-says-therese-coffey\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/aug/06/tories-must-show-they-care-about-the-environment-says-therese-coffey", "date_published": "2023-08-06T15:15:45+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Between the Women\u2019s World Cup and Barbie, we\u2019re finally having an honest discussion about girlhood | Van Badham", "description": "<p>To see the wild, thrilled faces of young fans is to remember the euphorias of my own girlhood that, sadly, never got to include howling at professional women\u2019s football</p><p>The tears came the night the Australians beat Canada in the Women\u2019s World Cup.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t at the beginning of the match, with anxiety, when the Matildas marched out to play knowing the match was do-or-die for their World Cup hopes, star skipper Sam Kerr on the bench and not quite \u2013 not yet \u2013 recovered from injury.

The latest revamp of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, directed by Jeff Rowe, is a case in point. The story is a fairly generic origin tale-meets-mutant-apocalypse: the turtles are chafing against the overprotective love of their humanoid-rat father figure, Master Splinter (voiced by Jackie Chan), but have yet to find a way to win the approval of the human world. The animation style, however, is gloriously anarchic: a scratchy, glitchy, scrawling onslaught that has more in common with the Biro\u2019d graffiti on a high school bathroom door than it does with the immaculate 3D realism that has, until recently, been the norm for big-budget animation.</p><p>There\u2019s a pleasing messiness to it all, a sense of barely controlled chaos that is matched by the jostling, overlapping voice performances. The nostalgic 80s and 90s hip-hop soundtrack is sublime, and while the action sequences can be hard to follow, there\u2019s no faulting the film\u2019s fizzing energy.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/06/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-mutant-mayhem-review-gloriously-anarchic-reboot\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/06/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-mutant-mayhem-review-gloriously-anarchic-reboot", "date_published": "2023-08-06T11:30:09+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "England ready for Nigeria World Cup test with Millie Bright back to her best", "description": "<p>Defender, who overcame injury before tournament, believes England can win last-16 game \u2018if they focus on themselves\u2019</p><p>There was a time when a World Cup knockout game against Nigeria seemed a long, long way away for Millie Bright.

Boyd took over the directorship of the Royal Shakespeare Company in 2003 when it was at crisis point.

The name fits. Since she moved to London from Akron, Ohio exactly 50 years ago, there has always been a defiant, determined, take-on-all-comers momentum to the singer\u2019s storied life and career. Hynde worked first at the <em>New Musical Express</em> in its heyday, and in Vivienne Westwood\u2019s Kings Road shop, Sex, and so was a formative spirit in British punk, involved at the beginning with the Clash and the Sex Pistols (she almost married both John Lydon and Sid Vicious in order to obtain a work permit). The Pretenders\u2019 eponymous first album, released in 1979, was one of the all-time great rock debuts, showcasing not only Hynde\u2019s era-defining voice, look and attitude but also her indelible songwriting gift on tracks that included Brass in Pocket, the first new No 1 of the 1980s. Since then, like one of the band\u2019s driving guitar lines, she has never let up.</p><p>Performing a memorable set at Glastonbury in July, with friends on stage including one-time bandmate Johnny Marr of the Smiths and Dave Grohl of the Foo Fighters, Hynde\u2019s voice, still so pure and edgy and seductive in its phrasing, transported the crowd across five decades of the Pretenders\u2019 music, from Back on the Chain Gang and Don\u2019t Get Me Wrong to tracks from the new album. <em>Relentless</em> inevitably addresses some of that inspiring longevity. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to get fat / We don\u2019t have to get old\u2026 We don\u2019t have to fade to black,\u201d Hynde sings, and, at 71, she seems living proof of that faith.
