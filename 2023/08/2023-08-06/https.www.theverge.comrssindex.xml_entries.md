  <p id="YhA71B">Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/1/23815770/sony-playstation-5-ps5-microsoft-xbox-series-x-xsx-deal-sale">we saw a rare deal drop</a> on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review">PlayStation 5</a> — only for it to disappear as quickly as it arrived. Thankfully, if you missed out on the unexpected deal at Monoprice, you now have another chance at saving $50 on Sony’s next-gen gaming console.</p>

Typically, we only see discounts on various bundles, which conveniently pair the console with titles such as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23437043/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-sony-ps5"><em>God of War Ragnarök</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23767669/final-fantasy-xvi-review-ps5"><em>Final Fantasy XVI</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22929852/horizon-forbidden-west-ps5-review"><em>Horizon Forbidden West</em></a><em> </em>but rarely dip below the $500 threshold.</p>

  <p id="6CQf4y">Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg says he’s “<a href="https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/CvnechDSJeC/">ready today</a>” to fight Elon Musk, who owns Twitter (currently rebranding as X), and said that although he had previously suggested August 26th as the date for their cage match, Musk hasn’t confirmed. “Not holding my breath,” said Zuckerberg, who also included a screenshot of Musk’s post on X / Twitter about <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1688087050527113216">lifting weights</a> to prepare.</p>

## Apple may be testing an M3 Mac Mini

  <p id="3vhV0Y">Apple could have a Mac Mini powered by its new M3 chip in the works for 2024, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>’s Mark Gurman in his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-08-06/apple-iphone-15-comes-amid-us-sales-slowdown-tim-cook-q3-earnings-comments-lkzfs14u"><em>Power On</em></a> newsletter today. Gurman says Apple is now testing a computer at its campus under model identifier Mac 15,12, but whether it's a Mac Mini is his speculation.</p>
<p id="MKCpO8">Gurman says the company is testing an eight-core CPU and a 10-core GPU Mac with 24GB RAM that’s running macOS Sonoma 14.1. Those specs are similar to the base model M2 Mac Mini, except for the memory installed — so far, entry-level Apple silicon Macs have started at 8GB RAM. (I wouldn’t read anything into that though; it would be very surprising if Apple jumped to 24GB for the base model.)</p>
<p id="pqC7oI">Gurman points out that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/3/23819093/apple-q3-2023-earnings-iphone-services-mac-ipad">in Apple’s earnings call</a>, the company said...</p>
