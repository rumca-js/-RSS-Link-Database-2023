But there\u2019s also a slew of upcoming indie games that showcase a ton of promise, and Pine Harbor is one such game. \n\nTaking place in an abandoned town ravaged by a difficult situation, you must do everything in your power to survive and ultimately find the cure to this disaster. The gameplay isn\u2019t anything revolutionary in terms of mechanics, but it is looking like a solid first-person horror experience that knows what notes to hit and how to play on one\u2019s fear of the unknown. It\u2019s set to release sometime in Q4 2023, and we\u2019re definitely excited to play this one.\n\nPlease consider subscribing for more awesome videos! https://www.youtube.com/@GamingBolt?sub_confirmation=1\n\nGame information:\n\nDisney Illusion Island\nRelease Date: Q4 2023\nPlatforms: PC", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXIWkPz1xoc", "date_published": "2023-08-06T15:30:06+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/EXIWkPz1xoc/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "15 Amazing Games of 2023 YOU ARE TOTALLY IGNORING", "description": "So far, 2023 has been the year that keeps on giving, thanks to its consistent stream of high-quality experiences, almost to the point where we\u2019ve barely had the time to reflect and relax on a game before moving on to the next big and excellent thing. That, of course, also means that there\u2019s been plenty over the last few months that a great many people have ended up missing. \n\nAs tightly packed as these last few months have been, there has been no shortage of excellent new games that have come and gone and haven\u2019t nearly received the sort of buzz that they should have, based purely on their quality. Here, we\u2019re going to talk about a few such games that you should probably be paying more attention to.\n\nPlease consider subscribing for more awesome videos! https://www.youtube.com/@GamingBolt?sub_confirmation=1\n\nTimestamps:\n\nIntro 00:00\nDave the Diver 0:47\nDredge 1:18\nAmnesia: The Bunker 1:55\nViewfinder 2:49\nCassette Beasts 3:26\nEverspace 2 4:13\nThe Last Case of Benedict Fox 4:55\nOxenfree 2 5:40\nWo Long: Fallen Dynasty 6:25\nPikmin 4 7:08\nJagged Alliance 3 8:06\nGhost Trick: Phantom Detective 8:46\nAliens Dark Descent 9:32\nTrepang2 10:25\nSystem Shock 2023 11:01\nThe End 11:46\n\nGame information:\n\nPikmin 4\nRelease Date: July 21, 2023\nPlatforms: Switch\n\nGhost Trick: Phantom Detective\nRelease Date: June 30, 2023\nPlatforms: Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows, Xbox One\n\nOxenfree 2: Lost Signals\nRelease Date: July 12, 2023\nPlatforms: Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows\n\nDave the Diver\nRelease Date: June 28, 2023\nPlatforms:  Windows\n\nDredge\nRelease Date: March 30, 2023\nPlatforms: Microsoft Windows, Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S\n\nJagged Alliance 3\nRelease Date: July 14, 2023\nPlatforms: Microsoft Windows\n\nAliens Dark Descent\nRelease Date: June 20, 2023\nPlatforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S\n\nViewfinder\nRelease Date: July 18, 2023\nPlatforms:  PlayStation 5, Windows\n\nCassette Beasts\nRelease Date: First available on April 26, 2023\nPlatforms: Windows, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch\n\nTrepang2\nRelease Date: June 21, 2023\nPlatforms:  Windows\n\nAmnesia: The Bunker\nRelease Date: June 6, 2023\nPlatforms: PlayStation 4, Windows, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S\n\nSystem Shock 2023\nRelease Date: May 30, 2023\nPlatforms:  Windows\n\nThe Last Case of Benedict Fox\nRelease Date: April 27, 2023\nPlatforms: Windows, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S\n\nEverspace 2\nRelease Date: First available on April 6, 2023\nPlatforms: Windows PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S\n\nWo Long: Fallen Dynasty\nRelease Date: March 3, 2023\nPlatforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tar1n6s6W0Y", "date_published": "2023-08-06T13:30:18+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/tar1n6s6W0Y/hqdefault.jpg"}]
