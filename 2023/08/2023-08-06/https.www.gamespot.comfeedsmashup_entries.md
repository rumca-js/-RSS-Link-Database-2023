<p>During your time in the Underdark in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, you will likely hear about a True Soul named Nere from a few different sources. Nere is not the nicest guy around, to say the least, and he's wanted by the Myconid Colony for crimes against their people as well as some of the Duergar for outstanding debts. Regardless of how you heard about Nere, your map will point you in the direction of the Grymforge in the Underdark, where Nere has been trapped via a cave-in.</p><p>The gnome slaves are working to get the True Soul out quickly, as there is poison gas in the room he's trapped in, and doesn't have much time left. If you manage to clear the cave-in without harming any of the gnomes, Nere will emerge and tempt you with an offer to join forces with him. However, you also might have an obligation to the Myconid Colony or others at the Grymforge to take his head. This guide will show both sides of the decision as well as how to free Nere in the first place.</p><h2>Freeing Nere from the cave-in at the Grymforge</h2><p>There are a few ways to go about clearing the rocks that are trapping Nere in the poison gas chamber. The primary way is to use a Runepowder or Smokepowder Satchel and blow up the rocks. You can receive Runepowder from Philomeen, who is located at the far north end of the Grymforge. You have to go around to the docks near the Grymforge waypoint, open the door near where two Duergar are dumping bodies into the water, and then make your way past Ooze enemies and up a steep path to reach Philomeen.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-should-you-side-with-nere-or-take-his-head/1100-6516603/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Baldur's Gate 3 - How To Improve Initiative In Combat

<p>When you're going into a fight in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, a dice roll determines who makes the first move. More often than not, attacking first can affect how the rest of an engagement plays out. Your party can deal some serious damage against enemies who haven't gotten a chance to reposition or buff themselves in any way. Rogues, for example, can use a melee or ranged sneak attack against enemies who have yet to take a turn yet, which is far easier to do if those characters go first in a fight.</p><p>While it might seem like the attack order in Baldur's Gate 3 is based on a random dice roll, that's not the case. Each character's Initiative determines the order, i.e. the higher a character's Initiative, the sooner they get to attack. As this is such an important mechanic in the game, you might be curious about how it works and, more crucially, how to improve your party's Initiative so you can always go first in combat.</p><h2>Improving Initiative in Baldur's Gate 3</h2><p>Initiative is mostly based on a character's <strong>Dexterity</strong> stat in Baldur's Gate 3. At the start of a fight, every participant will have the word "Initiative" and then a number appear over their heads. This number is determined by the roll of a d20 dice and then adds each participant's Dexterity modifier to that number.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-how-to-improve-initiative-in-combat/1100-6516602/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## It's No Secret Why Secret Of Mana Is Still Magical 30 Years Later

<p dir="ltr"><em>Secret of Mana is celebrating its 30-year anniversary today, August 6, 2023. Below, we look back at what set it apart from other RPGs of its era, and how in some ways it was ahead of its time.</em></p><p dir="ltr">The SNES in the early '90s ushered in the next generation of games with its 16-bit power, far more than that of its predecessor, and graphics that almost felt unbelievable at the time. RPGs came in by the dozens: Illusion of Gaia, Final Fantasy 3 (aka FF6), Breath of Fire 2, Chrono Trigger, Earthbound. All of these became instant classics or cult favorites down the line. Some were even rereleased on later consoles like the 3DS or even PS1. But one stands out as particularly special, drawing me back to it every year because it's just as good as when it was released in 1993: Secret of Mana.</p><p dir="ltr">Secret of Mana's lineage actually comes from other legacy titles. The brainchild of Final Fantasy alum Koichi Ishii, it is the sequel to the 1991 Japanese game Seiken Densetsu (meaning "The Legend of the Sacred Sword"), which was released in North America as Final Fantasy Adventure and in Europe as Mystic Quest. Ted Woolsey, a video game producer and American translator, admitted in interviews that the word "mana" used in the game is not a literal translation of the original game. "Seiken" was close enough to "secret" phonetically, and the game was rebranded for the States. That makes Secret of Mana the first Seiken Densetsu title to be marketed as part of the Mana series, rather than a Final Fantasy game.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/its-no-secret-why-secret-of-mana-is-still-magical-30-years-later/1100-6516579/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Paladin is one of the strongest classes in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, mostly in part due to the various abilities you receive as a part of your subclass. Your subclass sees you take an oath, which will determine how your Paladin acts to certain situations and makes up a majority of your background. However, just because you took an oath doesn't mean you need to follow it. If you want to break free from the path of your oath, then you can become an Oathbreaker Paladin.</p><p>Choosing to take this route will cause you to lose any abilities associated with your oath, but will open your character to new abilities and dialogue options. You can see exactly how to break your oath as a Paladin in Baldur's Gate 3 by reading the guide below.</p><h2>Becoming an Oathbreaker Paladin</h2><p>First and foremost, choosing to break your oath in Baldur's Gate 3 does not mean that you are making your Paladin an evil character. While you can, of course, take that route if you want, an Oathbreaker Paladin simply wants to veer away from their original oath to follow a new set of rules for themselves.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-become-an-oathbreaker-paladin-in-baldurs-gate-3/1100-6516601/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
