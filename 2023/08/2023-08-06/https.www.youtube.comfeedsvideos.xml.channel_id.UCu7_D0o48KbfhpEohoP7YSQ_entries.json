Of course, some of the tools are replaced. But many stayed. I will pin a comment with the changed tools.\n\nWhich are the essential tools in a lab? Which one do I use, and how am I organized? A video for all who are curious about how it looks behind the camera. Maybe you will discover something you can use for your own work?\nThis is also one of my few \"real\" appearances on YouTube.\n\nMy second channel: https://www.youtube.com/HB9BLAWireless\n\nLinks:\nWire Strippers: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DdxGPsf (I use both sizes)\nEquipment in my lab: http://www.sensorsiot.org/my-lab/\nEmpty Dupont shells: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DedOXHt or https://amzn.to/3YtHz9N\nCrimper: https://amzn.to/3OJ8Phn\nBreadboards: http://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/UzRzBqJ or https://amzn.to/3OHfY1G\nBlack hot glue: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DCb1FfH or https://amzn.to/3s0fxqn\nThe Art of Electronics: https://amzn.to/44VjCL2\nTroubleshooting Analog Circuits: https://amzn.to/3OJT2yH\nSkunkworks: https://amzn.to/3qivfwy\nThe Goal: https://amzn.to/3QrK0I7\nDas Ziel (German): https://amzn.to/45fNtgR\nThe Soul of a New Machine: https://amzn.to/45hAITg\nMaking of the Atomic Bomb:https://amzn.to/3KsP9vu\nThe Heart of the Enterprise: https://amzn.to/43VV03t\nMy favorite terminal emulator: https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/\nNotepad++: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/\nTrinocular: FyScope 3.5X-90X http://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/3Zvr3vN\n\nPatreon supporter companies:\nhttps://passiv-energie.gmbh/\nhttps://www.welectron.com/\nhttps://yosmart.com/\nYouTuber Patreon: https://www.youtube.com/@MakersMashup/\n\nThe links above usually are affiliate links that support the channel (at no additional cost to you).\nSupporting Material and Blog Page: http://www.sensorsiot.org\nGitHub: https://www.github.com/sensorsiot\nMy Patreon Page: https://www.patreon.com/AndreasSpiess\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/JfgDSa8\nIf you want to support the channel, please use the links below to start your shopping.
