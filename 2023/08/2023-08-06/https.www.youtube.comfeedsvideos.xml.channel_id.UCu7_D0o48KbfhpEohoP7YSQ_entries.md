This is a re-run of a video made on May 6, 2018. Of course, some of the tools are replaced. But many stayed. I will pin a comment with the changed tools.

Which are the essential tools in a lab? Which one do I use, and how am I organized? A video for all who are curious about how it looks behind the camera. Maybe you will discover something you can use for your own work?
This is also one of my few "real" appearances on YouTube.
