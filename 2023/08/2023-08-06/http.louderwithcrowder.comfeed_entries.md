Cameras are everywhere, so it makes for great content. That goes double if the nogoodniks have a weapon and the person they are attempting to mess with <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/thug-squeal-pig" target="_blank">has hands</a> and/or <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/grandma-takes-down-thug" target="_blank">no f*cks to give</a>. Welcome to a convenience store in Arizona, where three little punks met a big bad Marine and learned the words "Semper Fi" the hard way.</p><p>The video is from 2021, but is making its way around the internet again today since that's what viral videos do sometimes. On this second go around, it has racked up over two million views in less than a day.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Former Marine disarms armed robber <a href="https://t.co/CUaPskGKRS">pic.twitter.com/CUaPskGKRS</a><br />— CCTV IDIOTS (@cctvidiots) <a href="https://twitter.com/cctvidiots/status/1688148506052018176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 6, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>What makes this great content is that Sergeant Hands didn't even flinch. The dude looked like he was picking up a sixer and maybe a Snickers bar. He was mid-conversation when the attempted robbery was about to pop off. Sergeant Hands assessed the threat and immediately went into action.<br /></p><p>SGT. HANDS: ...yeah, these 'F*ck Joe Biden' chants are hysterical. I read about them <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/f-joe-biden" target="_blank">on the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website</a>.</p><p>THUG #1: Give me your money.</p><p>SGT. HANDS: How about I give you deez nuts instead.</p><p>THUG #1: I WANT MY MOMMY!</p><p>The threats were dealt with. Or, I should say "threats." The first guy wasn't much of a threat, and the other two were quick to run off like little biyatches. Sergeant Hands most likely went back to his conversation with the dude behind the counter, who was lucky he wore his brown pants that day.</p><p>Cheers to our hero saving the day! I give this video 7/10. It could have used some dialogue and the first thug saying "ouch" and "stop hitting me."</p><p>The Marine's name is James Kilcer and he was given the Yuma County Sheriff's Office's Citizen's Valor Award for "x." The best part? He showed up for the award wearing a "Let's Go Brandon" shirt!</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"></div><p>Hell yeah, Brother! Semper Fi!<br /></p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Elon Musk will pay legal expenses if you're fired over an X (formerly Twitter) post and the first person has come forward

This is gonna take some time.</p><p>The devil is in the details, which Musk didn't provide much of. Only the words "No Limit" and to please let the company know.

<p>Kara Creates's story is in the top five of the most ridiculous. <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11682563/Woman-fired-following-transphobic-Twitter-users-speaks-out.html" target="_blank">She was a community manager for video game company</a> Limited Run Games. Kara tweeted her excitement for the new Harry Potter video game that was coming out. Her having an opinion triggered a trans activist named Jessica Blank.</p><p>There was a Leftist push to shame people from not playing or reviewing the video game. One dinkus even created an app that let you <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/harry-potter-video-game" target="_blank">narc on your friends for downloading it</a>. See, Harry Potter was created by a woman named JK Rowling. JK Rowling has become the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jk-rowling-haters-tweet" target="_blank">HTIC: Head Transphobe in Charge</a>. She's <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jk-rowling-twenty-quotes" target="_blank">not transphobic at all</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jk-rowling-haters-tweet" target="_blank">scoffs at the accusation</a> while doing snow angels on a giant pile of money. But, reality has never gotten in the way of trans activists before.</p><p>Jessica (she/her/xir... I honestly don't know) dug through Kara's Twitter history. Turns out Kara follows @LibsOfTikTok and in 2016 (that's seven years ago) tweeted something about bathrooms. Jessica demanded she be fired. Limited Run couldn't;t bend the knee fast enough.</p><p>See if you spot the unintentional hilarity in this statement:</p><blockquote>LRG respects all personal opinions, however, we remain committed to supporting an inclusive culture. Upon investigating a situation, an employee was terminated.</blockquote><p>How much of this turns out to be true, what form this legal aid takes, and what legal actions Kara decides to take are still to be seen. As of this morning, it's just an hour's worth of conversations on X. What comes of it, if anything, is to be determined.</p><p>Elon has a lot of money. And there are a LOT of people who had their lives destroyed because of progressives and other Democrats forming an outrage mob.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Jamie Foxx attacked, apologizes for "antisemitic" Instagram post that wasn't antisemitic at all

Jamie Foxx shared a since deleted Instagram story that has since been deleted that randos on Twitter/X thought was antisemitic. It wasn't, but Foxx's PR team called for an apology anyway. And somehow Jennifer Aniston got ensnared in it for reasons that are still confusing.</p><p>Let's start with the now-deleted Instagram post. “They killed this dude named Jesus… What do you think they’ll do to you?! #fakefriends #fakelove.”</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>I, and I'm sure anyone with a functioning brain, took this to mean Foxx had someone close to him betray him. The actor is coming off a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jamie-foxx-speaks-health-scare" target="_blank">life-threatening health scare</a> (that someone blamed on the... <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jamie-foxx-trump-impersonation" target="_blank">you know</a>). What gives it away is the hashtags "fake friends" and "fake love."</p><p>Somehow, this turned into an antisemitism thing. I won't bother you with all the tweets. But it reached the threshold of "at least three idiots having the same dumb opinion" which makes this a story of a famous person being in hot water for saying a thing.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">I am a Jewish advocate who fights antisemitism. Jamie Foxx’s post was a horrifically antisemitic message rooted in classic blood libel and anti Jewish conspiracy theory. He has 16.7 million followers.

This is where things get confusing because, while I know losers will troll posts to see who they can like-shame, the people who like your Instagram stories are private. Also, when Aniston -- who has proven <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jennifer-aniston-won-t-be-there-for-you-if-you-refuse-the-vaccine" target="_blank">that she WON'T be there for you</a>, contrary to what the song says -- claims that she didn't like the post on purpose OR on accident.

<p>Of course, Foxx, or someone on his PR team, was forced to apologize because people didn't find the obvious meaning of his comments obvious: “I want to apologize to the Jewish community and everyone who was offended by my post. I now know my choice of words have caused offense and I’m sorry. That was never my intent. "o clarify, I was betrayed by a fake friend and that’s what I meant with ‘they’ not anything more.”</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
