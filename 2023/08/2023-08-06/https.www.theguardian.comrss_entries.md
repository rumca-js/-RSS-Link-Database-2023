<p>They have to survive in the wilderness for as long as possible – but these Brits can’t start fires, are constantly terrified and can’t be trusted with sharp objects. Which isn’t as funny as you might think…</p><p>The original version of Alone, a survivalist show with a large cash prize, is, of course, American. In it, a dozen or so contestants are dropped into a bear-studded and in various other ways inhospitable environment (usually the Alaskan or Canadian wilderness) and left to see who lasts longest alone (the clue is in the title).</p><p>The show is into its 10th season now. People who have spent their entire lives outdoors because they are American (and most of America, whatever their television exports tell us, is outdoors), hunt, fish, forage, build three-storey shelters with working lifts and south-facing balconies, make their own boats and in at least one case a ukulele and a football game to pass the time. The Australian version gave the US one a run for its money when it fielded a woman who had gained 19kg in preparation (contestants tend to lose at least that if they last any length of time and are often pulled out at the brink of starvation by the programme makers) before being dropped off in the Tasmanian nowhere wearing the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/29/alone-australia-tasmania-reality-tv#:~:text=In%20preparation%20for%20potentially%20months,than%20taking%20a%20sleeping%20bag.\">possum-skin coat/sleeping bag</a> she had made for herself.

<p>Star strikers Sam Kerr and Pernille Harder are the faces of women’s football in their countries. But the former Chelsea teammates will be fierce rivals when Australia meet Denmark in their World Cup clash</p><p>Sam Kerr and Pernille Harder share more than a few similarities. They are the faces of women’s football in Australia and Denmark respectively, national team captains and figureheads for the sport. They are among the best attacking players in the world, with a penchant for scoring – each averaging a goal every second game for their country. They are even similar in age and stature – just a year and a few centimetres apart. And they have spent the prime of their careers playing together, forming a potent partnership at Chelsea until Harder’s recent move to Bayern Munich.</p><p>But on Monday, when the Matildas meet Denmark in the round-of-16 at the Women’s World Cup, only one of these celebrated goal-scorers can triumph. In what is expected to be Sam Kerr’s first match of the tournament, returning from a calf injury suffered three weeks ago, the Matildas’ star will go head-to-head with her former team-mate. It will be a tale of two strikers (although the versatile Harder can play anywhere across the front-third).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/06/tale-of-two-strikers-as-former-teammates-duel-for-world-cup-glory">Continue reading...</a>

Six days before a first Wembley final in more than 50 years, the Leopards could have been forgiven had they taken their eye off the ball here. They had every excuse to lose this game, but losing isn’t something this team do that often.</p><p>This is a club with more on their mind than just the Challenge Cup. Leigh were playing in the Championship last season but there is now a growing possibility of a top-two finish in their first season back in Super League with this result. The victory was built firmly on a magnificent defensive effort, the perfect way to warm up for Wembley and the cup final against Hull Kingston Rovers next weekend. It means Leigh sit third with just six games to go; the playoffs are all but assured and a top-two finish, which guarantees a home semi-final, is still very much on the cards.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/06/leeds-rhinos-leigh-leopards-super-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A new book on George Orwell’s first wife examines how Eileen O’Shaughnessy’s life was erased</p><p>George Orwell’s first wife, Eileen O’Shaughnessy, made his work possible at the cost of her own by taking on the household drudgery and typing up his writing instead of completing her master’s in psychology. But <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/07/wifedom-by-anna-funder-review-a-brilliant-reckoning-with-george-orwell-to-change-the-way-you-read" title="">Wifedom, a remarkable new book</a> by Anna Funder, shows there was much more to a woman who appears only fleetingly in her husband’s work and is poorly served by his biographers. Shortly before meeting Orwell she wrote a dystopian poem titled <a href="https://orwellsociety.com/end-of-the-century-1984/" title="">End of the Century, 1984</a>; she suggested that he write an animal fable instead of an essay denouncing Stalinism; and she noted her husband’s “extraordinary political simplicity”. In Homage to Catalonia, Orwell mentions a shopping trip they make to buy stockings in Barcelona – but not that she had a political job in the offices of Poum (the Workers’ Party of Marxist Unification), for whom he fought in the civil war; nor that she took significant risks to get them and others out of the country after Stalin ordered his men to liquidate the party. She took risks, too, to save the manuscript.</p><p>Funder greatly admires Orwell’s work; <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/30/my-hunt-for-eileen-george-orwell-erased-wife-anna-funder" title="">she does not want</a> it to be “cancelled” by her unflattering portrait of him, especially his shoddy treatment of his wife. But she also notes that O’Shaughnessy “has been cancelled already – by patriarchy”; that is, “buried first by domesticity, and then by history”. Funder says she writes for the same reasons Orwell himself gave – “because there is some lie that I want to expose, some fact to which I want to draw attention”. Since the subject’s short life has left fewer traces than her husband’s, Funder enriches the facts with brief, novelistic sketches, allowing us to see this invisible woman anew.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/06/the-guardian-view-on-invisible-women-cancelled-by-history-restored-with-care">Continue reading...</a>

Oscar-winning screenwriter of films including One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest and Scent of a Woman<p>In the late 1970s, Bo Goldman was researching a script about Melvin Dummar, the unassuming Utah factory worker, gas station owner and former “Milkman of the Month” who was named as a $156m beneficiary in a will supposedly written by Howard Hughes but later successfully contested in court. Slowly, a realisation dawned on the screenwriter: “This man is a failure just like I am.”</p><p>It seemed an unusual conclusion to reach. After all, Goldman had written the book and lyrics for a Broadway musical, First Impressions, based on Pride and Prejudice, before he was 30, and won his first best screenplay Oscar (shared with Lawrence Hauben) for adapting One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest (1975), Ken Kesey’s novel set in a psychiatric institution, by the time he was 45.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/06/bo-goldman-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

Actor known for her roles in television comedies, the epic drama The Spoils of War and Coronation Street<p>At one time in the mid-1970s, the actor Anita Carey, who has died of breast cancer aged 77, seemed ever present in television comedy. But she switched to soap in 1978 when offered a short run in Coronation Street as Brenda Summers, a victim of domestic violence, who was befriended by Emily Bishop (played by Eileen Derbyshire).</p><p>“I’ve done so much comedy on television that I was anxious to get a really meaty dramatic role,” said Carey, who researched the subject by talking to women at a Manchester refuge. “The social relevance of the part was a big challenge. It made me think hard about battered wives.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/aug/06/anita-carey-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<ul><li>Slade given only 10 minutes by Steve Borthwick against Wales </li><li>Alex Dombrandt and Tom Willis also likely to miss out</li></ul><p>Steve Borthwick is set to drop a Rugby World Cup bombshell by leaving Henry Slade out of his final 33-man squad for the forthcoming tournament. The Exeter back is one of several players who appeared in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/05/steve-borthwick-rues-englands-missed-opportunities-in-defeat-by-wales">England’s disappointing defeat</a> by Wales expected to be axed by Borthwick with Joe Marchant, their brightest performer in Cardiff, preferred.</p><p>Slade’s expected absence comes as a huge surprise given his standing within the squad and as one of English rugby’s most naturally gifted players. He is a former vice-captain, started four Six Nations matches this year and has 56 caps to his name but appeared off the bench in Cardiff for just 10 minutes and it is believed he has been informed by Borthwick that he will not be part of the squad announced on Monday. Instead Borthwick is poised to opt for an extra 19th forward, with only 14 backs selected.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/06/henry-slade-set-to-be-biggest-omission-from-england-world-cup-squad">Continue reading...</a>

It looked like Cardiff would hold on for victory until Summerville found the bottom corner in injury time. It was the least Leeds deserved after a dominant second half.</p><p>While Leeds have desperately sent anyone out on loan they could, allowing five regulars from last season to depart on year-long deals and leaving holes in the squad, Cardiff have worked the loan market impressively.

<p><strong>Clare Seth</strong> on the need for a legal definition of kinship care and the provision of far-reaching help, not just financial. Plus a letter from <strong>Kate Gabb</strong></p><p>The complexities of caring for someone else’s child permanently as a kinship carer should not be underestimated, as your editorial highlights (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/01/the-guardian-view-on-kinship-carers-grandparents-cant-repair-a-broken-care-system" title="">1 August</a>). Parents have relied on kinship care for centuries. It enables children to grow up within their family, maintaining key relationships and links to communities. However, changing family dynamics are not easy to navigate. Children placed with kinship carers by a local authority are likely to have experienced loss, trauma and abuse, and need sensitive and attuned reparative care. Support for kinship carers, including financial help, should be available regardless of the legal status of the kinship arrangement.</p><p>As a membership organisation, CoramBAAF hears from local authorities about the many challenges they face in assessing and supporting kinship carers in the current legal and policy context. The government’s national kinship strategy is welcome and will increase the focus on kinship care. We hope that this will lead to a legal definition of kinship care and commitment to support. An allowance for all kinship carers is vital, but support needs to be far-reaching and responsive, and meet the needs of both the children and their carers.<br /><strong>Clare Seth</strong><br /><em>Kinship consultant, CoramBAAF</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/aug/06/kinship-carers-do-a-vital-job-they-must-get-better-support">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Will eating between meals encourage you to put on weight – or keep you lean? Is there such a thing as a healthy snack? Here’s what the science says</p><p>In terms of diet, humans can best be described as “omnivorous opportunists”. We don’t have the multichambered stomachs that help herbivores subsist on grass, but we have more molars than the average carnivore. Maybe it is no surprise, then, that we love to snack: we don’t need to graze, but neither are we into eating a whole gazelle, then sleeping for 20 hours.</p><p>The trouble is that things have moved on since we were grabbing a handful of berries here and an unwary rabbit there; these days, we are rarely more than a minute away from a couple of custard creams or a banana. Is our inbuilt inclination to snack doing us irreparable damage, or do all those calories even out in the end? And if you work in an office full of feeders, what is your best course of action?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/aug/06/should-i-worry-about-snacking">Continue reading...</a>

They enlist an additional actor, rising from within the audience, to play Graça, here escaping a quasi-fascist regime in Brazil.</p><p>Adapted and directed by the Brazilian film and theatre-maker Christiane Jatahy, this production might be seen as part of a growing – at times frustratingly derivative – trend to bring well-loved films to the stage.

<p>Ohio will be voting on a measure that makes it harder to amend the constitution in a high-stakes election – and the Republican proposal is ‘minority rule’, experts say</p><p>An under-the-radar election in Ohio on Tuesday has quietly emerged as one of the most high-stakes stress tests for American democracy in recent years.</p><p>The question Ohio voters will decide on 8 August is simple: how easy should it be to amend the state constitution?

<p>Only known portrait of a female second world war naval officer to go on display – but no one knows who she is</p><p>The faces of some of those who served “in peril on the sea” in the second world war are still familiar to us from portraits and archive news footage. This means a shared debt to those who served in the Royal Navy can at least be honoured, if not repaid. But many faces and names have been lost to time – especially if they were women.</p><p>Now the <a href="https://www.rmg.co.uk/" title="">Royal Museums Greenwich</a> are keen to reclaim one of those missing names. They have recently bought an extraordinary, characterful and rare portrait of a serving Wren – the name, from the acronym for the Women’s Royal Naval Service, then used for female naval officers working on shore. But the museum curators don’t know who she is. The image, painted in 1945, will go on show in a rehang in the historic <a href="https://www.rmg.co.uk/queens-house" title="">Queen’s House</a> and the museum is appealing today to readers who may recognise the face of a grandmother or aunt – or even, conceivably, see their own younger self reflected.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/06/the-war-hero-without-a-name-london-museum-hunts-for-wrens-identity">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Freud Museum, London</strong><br />Sigmund Freud’s momentous trip to Athens in 1904, and the subsequent realisation that he might surpass his father’s achievements, is captured in this small but enthralling show</p><p>In September 1904, Sigmund Freud set out with his brother Alexander on their annual Mediterranean holiday. They were aiming for Corfu, but the heat was so intense they took a ship from Trieste to Athens instead. The two men climbed the legendary hill above the city to visit the Acropolis and it was there that Freud became overwhelmed with a strange and bewildering sensation. “By the evidence of my senses I am now standing on the Acropolis,” he later wrote, “but I cannot believe it.”</p><p>This was not just the tourist’s usual expression of amazement: here we are at Machu Picchu, Petra, the Pyramids – and it feels so unreal! Freud experienced a complete incredulity that the Acropolis actually existed at all. He had read about it from childhood, studied engravings and daguerreotypes of the Parthenon, so elegant, grave and stoic; but now that he was here the strongest feelings were of filial guilt (that his father never saw it) and powerful disbelief. The experience would baffle him for decades.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/aug/06/tracing-freud-on-the-acropolis-freud-museum-london-review-freuds-big-fat-greek-guilt-complex">Continue reading...</a>

Our paths crossed at a family wedding, the place where grudges are often forged and dissolved.</p><p>I attended a casual gathering before the big day and there my eye fell upon my dad who, with his supersized personality, had always lived as a giant in my memory. I was surprised by his senior-citizen hair and general bodily mileage. I was deep into my 30s by then, it had been 20 years, and maybe I also looked diminished, weathered, tired from the long flight. He wore a velvet blazer and a maroon silk shirt, his usual sartorial flamboyance.

<p>A family full of women question their lives before a ‘living wake’ in the Carnegie medal-winning novelist’s triumphant first book for adults</p><p>In 2019, the poet Elizabeth Acevedo became the first writer of colour to win the Carnegie medal for her debut young adult novel in verse, <em>The Poet X</em>, and was shortlisted again in 2021 for <em>Clap When You Land</em>, both novels exploring the lives of teenage girls coming of age in a Dominican-American community. Now, in her first novel for adults, she expands these themes into an exuberant, polyphonic story of one family’s reckoning with their past.</p><p>Flor Marte – the second eldest of four Dominican sisters now living in New York – has always had “an ear for the gossip of death”: whenever she dreams of her teeth shattering, a death follows soon after. So when, at 70, Flor announces plans to host her own “living wake”, her three sisters, her daughter Ona (who narrates the book), and her niece Yadi fear that she must have foreseen the worst. The book spans the three days of preparation for the wake, during which Ona’s narrative moves chapter by chapter between the six women as they each grapple with their unresolved questions: bad husbands, infertility, desire, and the dual lives and conflicting loyalties of first- and second-generation immigrants.</p><p><em>Family Lore</em> by Elizabeth Acevedo is published by Canongate (£16.99).

<p>News last month of a police raid sparked fresh hopes of solving one of the most infamous killings in US history.

If the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/1994/apr/09/obituaries.adamsweeting">1994 death of Kurt Cobain</a> somehow symbolised young white alienation, the murder of Tupac Shakur two years later continues to resonate, not just because it was another deep and painful scar for the African American community, but because no one has ever been prosecuted for it. And it looked, for two decades, like no one ever would be.</p><p>It was something of surprise, then, when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/18/tupac-shakur-search-warrant-killing-las-vegas">armoured cars rolled into a quiet suburban street</a> in Henderson, Nevada last month in the sweltering 40C of a July evening and armed officers ordered out the occupants. “Come out with your hands empty,” shouted police. A middle-aged man and a woman exited, walking backwards towards the waiting officers. They were executing a search as part of an investigation into the killing of Shakur. The house belongs to Paula Clemons, wife of 60-year-old Duane Davis, better known as gang leader and former high-profile Los Angeles drug dealer Keefe D.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/06/who-murdered-tupac-shakur-william-shaw-keefe-d-nevada-raid">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With its refreshingly glitchy animation style and superb hip-hop soundtrack, the reptilian superheroes’s latest outing is a fizzing treat</p><p>Perhaps it’s the Spider-Verse effect, but mainstream animation for kids seems to be going through a period of rare visual creativity. The latest revamp of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, directed by Jeff Rowe, is a case in point. The story is a fairly generic origin tale-meets-mutant-apocalypse: the turtles are chafing against the overprotective love of their humanoid-rat father figure, Master Splinter (voiced by Jackie Chan), but have yet to find a way to win the approval of the human world. The animation style, however, is gloriously anarchic: a scratchy, glitchy, scrawling onslaught that has more in common with the Biro’d graffiti on a high school bathroom door than it does with the immaculate 3D realism that has, until recently, been the norm for big-budget animation.</p><p>There’s a pleasing messiness to it all, a sense of barely controlled chaos that is matched by the jostling, overlapping voice performances. The nostalgic 80s and 90s hip-hop soundtrack is sublime, and while the action sequences can be hard to follow, there’s no faulting the film’s fizzing energy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/06/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-mutant-mayhem-review-gloriously-anarchic-reboot">Continue reading...</a>

But why, wonders Caroline O’Donoghue, is the gay man/straight female friendship such a caricature in popular culture?</p><p>Ryan and I met working behind the tills in HMV Cork in the winter of 2009. We bonded instantly, and as we are both natural romantics, began the process of myth-making in our friendship while it was still slippery from birth. We moved in together quickly. We began writing a sitcom based on our lives, then got stoned and paranoid about being sued by former co-workers when we became famous. We left long Facebook posts on each other’s walls, quoting the things we said to one another, terrified that our specialness and our closeness would not be noticed or rewarded by the wider world. We wanted them to say: you two really have something here.</p><p>We were 19, and we were insufferable. But there was a lot of that kind of thing around. Bright young women and their even brighter gay friends were burning up our screens. There was <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/05/will-grace-review-gay-90s-sitcom-return" title="">Will &amp; Grace</a></em>, of course, and there was Stanford Blatch from <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/sex-and-the-city" title="">Sex </a></em><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/sex-and-the-city" title="">and The City</a></em>.

<p>The GOP is trying very hard to prove wrongdoing by father and son to distract from the three indictments of Donald Trump</p><p>The difference between six and seven is slight but, in the mouth of Joe Biden, it meant everything. “I have seven grandkids,” the US president <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/01/joe-hunter-biden-granddaughter-navy">said in a podcast interview</a> this week.</p><p>That was Biden’s way of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/08/opinion/hunter-biden-child.html">yielding to critics</a> and acknowledging his four-year-old granddaughter, Navy Joan Roberts.

## Sir Michael Boyd brought visionary gleam to Shakespeare and Stratford

<p>The Royal Shakespeare Company’s former artistic director was a great theatrical leader whose legacy includes proving the history cycle is at the centre of our national story</p><p>News of the death of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/04/sir-michael-boyd-former-artistic-director-royal-shakespeare-company-dies-aged-68">Sir Michael Boyd</a> at the age of 68 has come as a shock. Boyd took over the directorship of the Royal Shakespeare Company in 2003 when it was at crisis point. It had a deficit of more than £2m, had forfeited its London base in the Barbican and, in the words of its former literary manager, Colin Chambers, was in danger of becoming a corporation rather than a company. By the time of his departure in 2012, Boyd had restored the RSC to something of its former glory and I would highlight three facets of his achievement.</p><p>For a start there was his skill as a director. It first hit me in 1999, when as an associate to Adrian Noble, he did <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/1999/mar/27/artsfeatures1">a production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream</a> – the best since Peter Brook’s – that turned the play into a foot-stamping erotic fertility rite. But Boyd’s greatest success came with his eight-play cycle of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/mar/19/rsc.theatre">Shakespeare’s histories</a> which reached fulfilment in 2008. At its heart lay the idea, to borrow a phrase from TS Eliot’s Four Quartets, of “time future contained in time past”. You saw that at the start of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/apr/16/theatre1">Richard II</a> when Jonathan Slinger’s king stepped gingerly over the corpse of Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester: a vital image in that Richard’s implication in Gloucester’s murder leads to the unravelling of his authority which in turn produces decades of civil strife.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/06/visionary-gleam-michael-boyd-royal-shakespeare-company">Continue reading...</a>

<p>How better to celebrate 50 years of the stunning West Country network than walking one of these Cornwall, Devon or Dorset sections</p><p>Glittering seas, spectacular cliffs, tranquil farmland and vast skies – whether you stroll, walk or hike the South West Coast Path, the scenery is some of the most beautiful in the UK. The country’s longest trail stretches for 630 miles from Minehead in Somerset, along the Devon and Cornwall coast to Poole Harbour in Dorset. This year is the 50th anniversary of the creation of the South West Coast Path Association, when a group of walkers, having tackled the Pennine Way, decided to create something similar in the West Country.</p><p>“It was quite a task,” says Althea Mays of the SWCPA, “and it took five years: linking paths, talking to landowners about rights of way, getting the trail designated – almost like putting a giant jigsaw together.” The trail remains one of the UK’s most popular routes, with more than 600 different walks to choose from. “We suggest a 52-day itinerary if you want to do the whole thing,” says Mays. “But many people come and do a section each year, making it an annual weekend with friends or family. Walking is such a companionable thing, and the pandemic really reinforced the importance of immersing ourselves in nature and taking time to enjoy the outdoors.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/aug/06/five-of-the-best-walks-south-west-coast-path-england-dorset-devon-cornwall">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Roast tomatoes flooded with flavour, and a fruity summer pudding to lift the spirits</p><p>There is plenty of life in the summer yet. The berries are coming at us in waves of scarlet, ruby and black; the early plums and gages are ready for pies and jam, fresh filbert nuts are here to munch on, and the tomato glut will keep us busy.</p><p>In the years when I grew tomatoes in earnest, first in wide terracotta pots, then up canes in the vegetable beds, the fruits would often ripen all at once, leading to the need for every tomato recipe in my head. Soup, of course, but also crisp tomato tarts with an underlayer of basil pesto. The plumpest variety, Marmande, would be stuffed with cannellini beans and parmesan or rubbed over the coarse side of a grater on to toasted, sliced focaccia with a spreading of olive paste.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/aug/06/nigel-slater-recipes-roast-tomatoes-butter-beans-gochujang-and-cream-cheese-puddings-with-summer-ber">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘We became activists by necessity’: The fight to close the UK’s largest opencast mine

<p>The Ffos-y-Fran coalmine was supposed to close last September. So why is it still operating? And how long will the local community have to put up with the noise, pollution and health impacts?</p><p>Chris and Alyson Austin have put on a spread. “It’s nothing special, just standard Valleys hospitality,” they each in turn insist, de-clingfilming dishes on their dining table. It’s lunchtime on a rainy summer afternoon in South Wales. Drenched as I am from an hour spent on foot in the countryside surrounding their home on the outskirts of Merthyr Tydfil, the oven chips, sausage rolls and sandwiches (egg mayo, ham) are hugely welcome. “We’ve lived in this house for 20 years. It’s where we’ve raised our kids,” Chris explains. “Both of us grew up in this area.” The couple bought the place when the modern estate was brand new. “I was working in computing in Swansea; Alyson was a bookkeeper. The kids were four and six. It was supposed to be the perfect move. All very traditional.”</p><p>“That’s the thing,” Alyson chimes in. “There’s nothing unusual about us at all. We’re Mr and Mrs Normal.” She winks in my direction. Because, of course, the pair are anything but. They might not look like archetypal environmental campaigners, but together they’ve spent the past two decades in the trenches of a colossal climate battle – one that unfolded right on their doorstep. Just a few hundred metres away from where we’re sitting is the Ffos-y-Fran opencast coalmine: the UK’s largest, owned by Merthyr (South Wales) Ltd. Even before it opened, they opposed it. It’s a fight they believe, on all accounts, should long be over. Not only because we know how environmentally damaging burning coal is, amid an ever-escalating climate crisis. It’s also that in September last year, permission to mine there expired. The Austins, expert lawyers and environmental groups all allege it has continued to operate illegally. Coal Authority records reveal that more than 284,000 tonnes of coal have been extracted since September.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/06/we-became-activists-by-necessity-the-fight-to-close-the-largest-opencast-mine-uk">Continue reading...</a>

Last week’s outburst against his prosecutors is part of a long campaign that many fear is in danger of subverting democracy<p>American democracy is only as strong as its legal system. The founders of the country created the judiciary as the third branch of the federal government to keep executive power in check and prevent corruption. So it was a cause for deep concern last week when Donald Trump unleashed a verbal tantrum on his Truth Social platform, accusing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/03/who-is-jack-smith-special-counsel-indictment-trump" title="">special counsel Jack Smith</a> of “prosecutorial misconduct” even before he filed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/01/donald-trump-charged-2020-election" title="">four federal criminal counts</a> against the former president over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election in a bid to remain in office.</p><p>An identical barrage came last April when a Manhattan grand jury indicted Trump on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-charges-falsifying-business-records.html" title="">34 felony charges </a>for falsifying business records. That time, he also called for defunding the justice department and the FBI, even though the charges did not come from either federal agency. Both reactions were part of a long-running campaign by Trump to undermine the rule of law in the US and dismiss the multiple charges he faces, and has denied, as politically motivated. Even lawyers who once supported Trump have told me that delegitimising the law and the judiciary could destroy the country’s system of government. Yet, even if he is convicted, Trump’s supporters will probably remain loyal to him, convinced that the entire legal system is “rigged” – a favourite Trumpism.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/06/donald-trump-assault-american-justice-gives-inspiration-authoritarians-everywhere">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Wales have some wind in their sails after Cardiff victory but time is running out for visitors to find a winning formula</p><p>If the old adage goes that you cannot win the World Cup during the warm-ups but you can lose it, Steve Borthwick can console himself that this disappointing defeat need not be terminal. There is no need to overly panic after what goes down as a third loss in a row and a fourth in six under Borthwick. But after insisting his players stick to the script, rather than worrying about Monday’s squad announcement, you have to wonder if it needs rewriting.</p><p>For the most worrying aspect – other than the dreadfully misfiring lineout – is that it was not abundantly clear what England were even trying to achieve against an unknown Wales side. If we are being kind to England then we can conclude that this was a waste of time that Borthwick simply does not have, and while there is the obvious caveat that his was nothing like his first-choice side, that opening warm-up matches are often of limited value, it must be remembered that Wales began the summer at a similar ebb. They now have some wind in their sails whereas England’s remain limp.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/aug/06/england-auditioners-fluff-their-lines-and-steve-borthwick-needs-new-script">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A British fan with a keen eye for detail paints a charming portrait of the beautifully designed Métro, which was conceived as the antithesis of London’s tube system</p><p>In this potpourri of a book on the Paris Métro, British author Andrew Martin is not so much writing an ode to the Métropolitain as providing rail fanatics with a literary handbook. You don’t need to be familiar with “third-rail electrification” and “the MP73s, third-generation tyred trains” to enjoy the eclectic information and funny anecdotes of this charming book – but it would sometimes help. Perhaps better assembled as a dictionary of the Métro, in the style of the <em><a href="https://www.lisez.com/plon/collection-dictionnaire-amoureux/58594">Dictionnaire amoureux</a></em><a href="https://www.lisez.com/plon/collection-dictionnaire-amoureux/58594"> series</a> published since 2000 in France by Plon, Martin’s short book will nonetheless give Paris and Métro lovers what they are looking for: the infectious enthusiasm of a passionate fan with a clear eye for details.</p><p>I naturally chose to read <em>M</em><em>etropolitain</em> on the Paris Métro, which added some relief and piquancy to the experience. Martin, whose dad worked for British Rail, developed a fascination for le Métro: its smell, its “unified vision”, its lighting, carriages, vaults and tunnels, for its names and colours, all of which were designed as the antithesis of London’s tube. “The London Underground was the world’s first metro, and Paris, having taken a long cool look at it, decided to do the opposite.” There would be no entrance buildings; it would be built much closer to the surface; much denser, all Parisians would live within 500 metres of a métro station; airy and large, carriages would feel tall to passengers, to avoid claustrophobia; and with binary directions, and easy connections, there would be no risk of losing oneself in a subterranean maze.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/06/metropolitain-an-ode-to-paris-metro-andrew-martin-review-paris-metro">Continue reading...</a>

He looks not so much 50 as immortal – back on the Royal Opera House stage (where he last performed in 2016) for a gorgeously miscellaneous crowd-pleaser, a five-night gala, to celebrate his half century.</p><p>George Balanchine’s <em>Apollo</em>, which Acosta danced with Darcey Bussell in 2007, is one of his favourite pieces, and the section he dances from it makes a miraculous start. But <em>Carlos at 50</em> – a mix of scenes lifted from ballets and discrete pieces – depends not on miracles but on toil, self-belief and pacing. Acosta’s comeback is harder than any rock star’s because the age-defying expectation is on an exactingly different level. As he joked in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jul/16/carlos-acosta-at-50-royal-opera-house-interview">an interview with Sarah Crompton in the </a><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jul/16/carlos-acosta-at-50-royal-opera-house-interview">Observer</a></em>: “I have to do it in a way that I can still walk off and you don’t have to call an ambulance for me.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/06/carlos-at-50-royal-opera-house-review-acosta-gorgeous-birthday-bash-with-friends-and-family">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For the first time in years, I have a week by myself. I can have an affair, write a great novel, eat all the best biscuits</p><p>My family had gone on holiday, leaving me alone, and I was making a list. Of things to do now that I had the space and the time. Things to achieve. Pleasures to savour. Even the act of making the list felt luxurious. A sharp pen, a clean page, good posture, Mini Magnum, right. It was difficult, though, to know where to start. This was the first time in nine years that I’d had more than a night or two by myself, without the cluttered emotions and rigid routines of young children, school days, pasta, questions, the brushing of hundreds of tiny little teeth. I intended to use it not just wisely but fabulously.</p><p>Before they left I briefly sketched out a rough schedule for a potential affair: if I met an interesting stranger on the Monday, say, bonded over a good joke with them on Tuesday, ensured our politics, tastes, anxieties and peccadilloes aligned on Wednesday, took some time for self-care and personal growth, essential for any relationship, on the Thursday, met their parents on Friday, performed enlightening sexual adventures on Saturday, then said a chaste ceremonial goodbye forever on the Sunday, I could conceivably join my partner and kids in France having got it all out of my system by Monday, 11.30, 12ish? On reflection though, the admin seemed quite overwhelming, and wouldn’t I prefer, in fact, to walk lazily around the house and enjoy the velvet interior of my own mind?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/aug/06/home-alone-the-days-felt-ripe-to-fill-but-then-reality-returned">Continue reading...</a>

## Paris Memories review – soulful portrait of a terrorist attack survivor

<p>Based on her brother’s experience of the Bataclan attack in Paris, Alice Winocour’s unexpectedly hopeful drama is lit up by a César-winning performance from Virginie Efira <br /></p><p>At the start of <em>Paris Memories</em>, Alice Winocour’s thoughtful drama about coping with trauma in the aftermath of a terrorist attack, Mia (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/01/virginie-efira-on-every-third-page-of-the-script-there-was-something-crazy-sacred-intimate">Virginie Efira</a>) drops a water glass. It smashes into fragments that Mia, sighing with annoyance, collects and discards. It’s a seemingly banal moment, given a slight sense of unease by the evocative choice of music – Arvo Pärt’s pensive <em>Fratres</em> for strings and percussion – but it foreshadows Mia’s own fate. A stylish, self-assured translator who is fluent in Russian, she finds herself completely broken by the experience of being caught in a terrorist attack on a busy Paris brasserie. Three months after the event, she starts the process of piecing together her shattered memories of the attack, even as she comes to realise that some elements of her life are beyond repair.</p><p>There’s a sense that, having survived something as horrific as a mass shooting, fortysomething Mia is bent into a shape that no longer quite fits into her old world – a theme that has parallels with combat veteran dramas such as the impressive 2010 British indie <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/dec/12/in-our-name-review">In Our Name</a></em> and the recent Jennifer Lawrence picture <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/05/causeway-review-jennifer-lawrence-brian-tyree-henry">Causeway</a></em>. Reconnecting with well-meaning friends to celebrate her partner’s birthday, Mia viscerally recoils from the candle-adorned cake – it opens a door to a buried recollection of the attack – and instead hides from her guests in the bathroom with her cat. Her partner, Vincent (Grégoire Colin), is sympathetic up to a point, but he has his own layers of guilt to process about leaving Mia alone that fateful evening, and his reasons for doing so.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/06/paris-memories-review-soulful-portrait-of-a-terrorist-attack-survivor-alice-winocour-virginie-efira-paris-attacks-bataclan-arvo-part">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Pretenders frontwoman and punk pioneer takes questions from Observer readers and famous fans on her relentless creativity spanning half a century, rethinking her hippy youth, and her cruelty-free farm</p><p>Chrissie Hynde has called the Pretenders’ new album – their 12th – <em>Relentless</em>. The name fits. Since she moved to London from Akron, Ohio exactly 50 years ago, there has always been a defiant, determined, take-on-all-comers momentum to the singer’s storied life and career. Hynde worked first at the <em>New Musical Express</em> in its heyday, and in Vivienne Westwood’s Kings Road shop, Sex, and so was a formative spirit in British punk, involved at the beginning with the Clash and the Sex Pistols (she almost married both John Lydon and Sid Vicious in order to obtain a work permit). The Pretenders’ eponymous first album, released in 1979, was one of the all-time great rock debuts, showcasing not only Hynde’s era-defining voice, look and attitude but also her indelible songwriting gift on tracks that included Brass in Pocket, the first new No 1 of the 1980s. Since then, like one of the band’s driving guitar lines, she has never let up.</p><p>Performing a memorable set at Glastonbury in July, with friends on stage including one-time bandmate Johnny Marr of the Smiths and Dave Grohl of the Foo Fighters, Hynde’s voice, still so pure and edgy and seductive in its phrasing, transported the crowd across five decades of the Pretenders’ music, from Back on the Chain Gang and Don’t Get Me Wrong to tracks from the new album. <em>Relentless</em> inevitably addresses some of that inspiring longevity. “We don’t have to get fat / We don’t have to get old… We don’t have to fade to black,” Hynde sings, and, at 71, she seems living proof of that faith. She is an advocate for keeping on keeping on, as she told <em>NME</em>, with “no abatement of intensity. It’s the life of the artist. You never retire. You become relentless.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/06/chrissie-hynde-you-ask-questions-pretenders-relentless-interview">Continue reading...</a>

The success of the likes of Greatest Hits Radio is because old songs have the power to conjure memories of our youth<p>What’s the deal with ears – why do they seem to age at triple the rate of the rest of the human body? I don’t mean physically, but rather in terms of what music an individual deems magical, or even tolerable. And how, for many, there’s only one true music – the music of their youth – and everything else is cacophony, sacrilege, torture.</p><p>Maybe this explains how the “boomer” has risen again in a terrifying new form.

## The big picture: Danish Siddiqui’s vivid image of Mumbai street life

<p>The late war photographer’s atmospheric portrait of a sleeping chicken seller provides a glimpse of real lives in the city</p><p>The photographer Danish Siddiqui joined the Reuters agency as an intern in 2010 and a year later, at the age of 28, became its full-time stringer in Mumbai. He concentrated at first on images of the city’s streets – colleagues recall how he often spent weeks getting to know his subjects in order to convey the truth of their lives. This picture of the chicken seller asleep on his cart is typical of his pictures of that period. Siddiqui graduated quickly to frontline news for the agency, covering the war in Afghanistan and the battle to retake Mosul from Islamic State. He received two Pulitzer prizes for his work: the first as part of the team covering the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/rohingya">Rohingya</a> refugee crisis and the second for his profound images documenting the spread of Covid-19 across the subcontinent.</p><p>That latter prize was awarded to Siddiqui posthumously. On 16 July 2021 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/jul/16/danish-siddiqui-pulitzer-prize-winning-photojournalist-killed-by-taliban-in-afghanistan">he was killed</a> by Taliban fighters in Kandahar province, having been embedded with Afghan special forces, one of 80 working journalists to lose their life in that conflict. He was 38 years old. A book of his photographs was published this summer to mark two years since his death, with proceeds going to his widow and two children. The book is, on every page, an expression not only of Siddiqui’s talent and his courage, but of his determination to give a human face to some of the world’s injustices. He was, by the accounts of colleagues, always a man with that mission. He said in a <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/danish_siddiqui_documenting_conflict_beyond_borders/transcript">Ted Talk in 2014</a>: “As a photojournalist, I am exposed to the best of humanity and to the worst and everything in between. My role is as a mirror; I want to expose you to the raw truth [of the world] and make you a witness to it. You can look away – or you can stand up and act for change.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/aug/06/the-big-picture-danish-siddiquis-vivid-image-of-mumbai-street-life">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Like characters in Dario Fo’s farce, we complain about, but tolerate, the most damaging political scandal of our time</p><p>At the beginning of the first Thatcher government (1979-83), the economist John Kenneth Galbraith wrote that Britain was the perfect place to conduct the dubious monetarist experiment recommended by his fellow economist Milton Friedman. This was because although Galbraith (rightly) thought the policy was crazy, British “phlegm” would see us through, and the tolerant nation would not “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/nov/14/william-keegan-just-like-the-1980s" title="">take to the streets</a>”.</p><p>This memory came to mind recently when I was at the revival of that great 1970s classic <em>Accidental Death of an Anarchist</em>.

The memory was evoked by the central character, the “maniac”, declaring: “Scandal is to society what confession is to the sinner. It’s a catharsis [that] fixes nothing: the hostile environments, the sewage in the seas, the peerages for political donors. And what’s the result? Do we arrest anyone? Can we change anything? Of course not … In glorious democracies such as ours, we get to moan about it instead.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/aug/06/brexit-is-the-villain-in-accidental-death-of-the-economy">Continue reading...</a>

Boosting birthrates  to protect racial  identity has a long  and shameful history<br /><p>‘I’ve done my bit by having six children, <a href="https://twitter.com/Jacob_Rees_Mogg/status/1684841887121670144" title="">so now you do yours</a>”, Jacob Rees-Mogg demanded of GB News viewers recently. Not so long ago, politicians were panicking about overpopulation. Now many worry that there are – or will be – too few people in the world. “There is one critical outcome that liberal individualism has completely failed to deliver and that is babies,” one of the rising stars of the Tory party, MP Miriam Cates, <a href="https://www.miriamcates.org.uk/news/our-declining-birth-rate" title="">told the National Conservatism conference</a> in May.</p><p>The resurgence of such natalism has been provoked by falling birthrates across the globe. In 1950, according to a <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30677-2/fulltext" title="">study in the <em>Lancet</em></a>, women were having an average of 4.7 children in their lifetime. By 2017, that had fallen to 2.4 and is predicted to fall below 1.7 by 2100. England and Wales are almost at that figure now, the birthrate having dropped from 2.9 in 1964 to <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/bulletins/birthsummarytablesenglandandwales/2021" title="">1.61 in 2021</a>, marking, in Cates’ view, a “population collapse”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/06/conservative-calls-women-more-babies-hide-pernicious-motives">Continue reading...</a>

For an instant cosmetic lift, get on the lash sweep, plus, intense lipsticks and treats with added extras<p>Many moons ago I remember reading about famous people’s beauty habits (these days I try to occupy my time with more useful things). Mascara was the one item of makeup many would not leave the house without. I didn’t get it. As my lashes slowly become inexplicably sparser and shorter, I got it. A decent mascara is magic – as seen backstage at Givenchy. Yes, it gives the illusion of longer fuller lashes, but you also look healthier, awake, more youthful and, worn on its own, it gives off a chic insouciance that you look fabulous without making much of an effort.</p><p><strong>1.

Nothing will change until politicians of all parties acknowledge that too many people are in prison<p>Britain’s public service infrastructure has been radically transformed over the past couple of centuries. But, as noted by former prime minister <a href="https://prisonreformtrust.org.uk/sir-john-major-we-over-use-prison-and-under-value-alternative-sentences/" title="">John Major</a> earlier this year, one standout exception is the prison system.</p><p>Many prisons were built in the Victorian era, when they were designed to house a single prisoner per cell. In today’s dangerously overcrowded estate, their cells often house two, or sometimes even three, prisoners, plus a toilet. The new analysis of inspection reports shows prison conditions continue to get worse. As Major argues: “To have inmates held in worse conditions than in Victorian times is an indictment of policy that is hard to ignore.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/06/uk-prison-crisis-damages-justice-society-and-prisoners">Continue reading...</a>

From chenin to cinsault, South Africa’s wines are not just cleverly made but great value, too<p><strong>Cape Point Fairtrade Sauvignon Blanc, South Africa 2022 (£7, <a href="https://www.coop.co.uk/">The Co-op</a></strong><strong>)</strong><strong> </strong>South Africa makes some fabulous fine wines, made by producers who go to sometimes extreme lengths to find their plots of old vines in remote and unusual places, and which taste like they could only come from a specific part of the world. That’s one side of the story. The other is the winelands’ ability to create excellent-value bottles filled with what wine people call ‘varietal character’: ie wines that taste like the grape they’re made from. In many cases, the producer behind the bargain £7 bottle and the winemaker producing the arrestingly evocative ‘wine of place’ are one and the same. Such is the case with Cape Point, on the southern tip of the Cape, which makes the outstandingly rich but incisive Isliedh 2020 (£39.75, <a href="https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/" title="">thewhiskyexchange.com</a>) and the zippy, mouthwatering Fairtrade bottling at The Co-op.</p><p><strong>Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference Fairtrade Chenin Blanc, South Africa 2022 (£8.50, <a href="https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/gol-ui/product/sainsburys-chenin-blanc--taste-the-difference">Sainsbury’s</a></strong><strong>) </strong>Sauvignon blanc has become one of the Cape’s calling cards in recent years, its producers having hit on a happy medium of a style that sits very well between the more restrained nettly greenness of the Loire, and the vivaciously expressive style of New Zealand. But sauvignon is still some way off competing with South Africa’s biggest and brightest varietal star, chenin blanc, which is behind an outsized proportion of the Cape’s most interesting wines. Those bottles might be great-value single-varietal expressions, such as the lively and tropically tangy dry white from Sainsbury’s. Or white blends in which chenin stars, such as two from one of the Cape’s most creative winemakers, Adi Badenhorst: the peachy, fresh The Curator White Blend 2022 (£8.99, Waitrose) and the astonishingly complex Kalmoesfontein White 2020 (£32.95, <a href="https://swig.co.uk/" title="">swig.co.uk</a>).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/aug/06/grapes-from-the-cape-south-africas-signature-wine-styles">Continue reading...</a>

I should have known that this was going to happen, time being linear and all that, but I don’t think I’d ever realised just how much time a summer break actually lasts.</p><p>We’ve signed my son up for one of those local summer workshop things that mostly exist to enable working parents to stay employed, but cost so much that you basically end up working for free for its duration. This one has a musical element, for which he and his classmates will rehearse Maybe from <em>Annie</em> (to my mind the finest song in which an orphaned child theorises on the social class of their biological parents).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/aug/06/seamas-oreilly-the-long-school-holidays-are-testing-times-for-parents">Continue reading...</a>

It is inspired by the experience of co-writer Laura Wilde and her partner Kyle Falconer, best known as singer of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/dec/12/popandrock">the View</a>. His second solo album, No Love Songs for Laura, from 2021, provides the material for a gig-theatre chamber piece about a couple torn apart by career ambitions and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/postnatal-depression">postnatal depression</a>.</p><p>The script, co-written with Johnny McKnight, is a miniature soap opera in which the needs of Lana (Dawn Sievewright), isolated and insecure as the mother of a baby boy, come into conflict with the opportunities presented to Jessie (John McLarnon), a songwriter who gets a break in America just when he is needed most at home. Many of the details of childbirth and parenthood are familiar, and there is a generic quality to the early boy-meets-girl scenes, but it is written with knowledge and compassion, and rises in intensity as Lana is overwhelmed by her mental illness.</p><p><a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/no-love-songs">At the Traverse theatre, Edinburgh, until 27 August</a></p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/edinburgh-festival-2023+tone/reviews">All our Edinburgh festival reviews</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/06/no-love-songs-review-traverse-edinburgh">Continue reading...</a>

Here’s what to watch this evening</p><p>“I’m completely butt-naked in the forest and I’ve just seen some bear scat. I think I’m losing my mind.” On the bright side, it might not have been a bear. This new adventure contest (adapted from a US template) – which looks to test its participants almost to destruction – is set in an area of rural Canada that we’re told is also home to numerous cougars and wolves. Armed only with GoPro cameras and 10 survival items of their choosing, contestants are dumped in the wilderness – and the last participant to bail wins £100k. Very quickly, one contender contrives to bury an axe in his own leg – but the others fare little better, struggling with fire, food and assorted wildlife. <strong>Phil Harrison</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/aug/06/tv-tonight-channel-4s-wild-new-reality-show-tests-its-contestants-to-destruction">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Zelenskiy condemns attack on blood transfusion centre as ‘war crime’; Moscow vows retaliation over strike on Russian tanker in Kerch Strait</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia+ukraine">See all our Russia-Ukraine war coverage</a></li></ul><p><strong>The Ukrainian president, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy">Volodymyr Zelenskiy</a>, says Russia has attacked a blood transfusion centre in the country as he condemned the fatal strike as a “war crime”</strong>. A separate attack struck a key factory, both incidents coming just hours after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/05/russian-oil-tanker-hit-by-ukrainian-sea-drone-off-occupied-crimea">Kyiv hit a Russian tanker in the Kerch Strait.</a> Russian forces struck the blood transfusion centre in the Kharkiv region of north-east <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a>, Zelenskiy said, adding that “dead and wounded are reported”. A “guided air bomb” hit the centre in Kupiansk, a city a few dozen kilometres from the Russian border, he said.</p><p><strong>Ukraine carried out a drone strike on a Russian tanker in the Kerch Strait, a day after one of Moscow’s warships was hit in the Black Sea. </strong>A video released by Ukrainian authorities appeared to show an unmanned sea drone striking the side of the 141-metre Russian-flagged Sig under the darkness of night. The strike was the second such naval attack in a 24-hour period, after the scuppering of a Russian landing ship on Friday outside the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk. Maria Zakharova, Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, said Moscow would retaliate.</p><p><strong>Russia says it has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/aug/05/russia-ukraine-war-live-russian-tanker-hit-by-drones-saudi-arabia-talks-will-be-difficult-says-kyiv-envoy?page=with:block-64ce34f28f08e5e4127cf55f#block-64ce34f28f08e5e4127cf55f">captured the settlement of Novoselivske</a> in north-eastern Ukraine, where Kyiv has reported increased attacks.</strong> Footage from the Russian army showed Novoselivske completely destroyed, with white smoke billowing over crumbling buildings. Ukrainian army spokesperson Ganna Malyar said Russian troops were aiming to draw Ukrainian resources to the east, as Ukraine pursues its counter-offensive in the south.</p><p><strong>There were reports of explosions in several cities including Kyiv and Zaporizhzhia with air alerts</strong>. Ukraine said Russia fired ballistic and Kinzhal missiles into cities with some reports indicating Russian forces were firing missiles from inside Belarusian territory. Zelenskiy’s spokesperson Iuliia Mendel tweeted: “Right now the missile attack is at Kyiv, Vinnutsia, Zhytomyr, Cherkasy regions. But the alert is all over Ukraine.”</p><p><strong>Zelenskiy has promised a fresh round of institutional “cleaning”</strong>, a reference to his campaign to show western partners that Kyiv has moved on from a history of deep-rooted corruption. “Next week will be a continuation of our work on cleaning state institutions of those who tried to drag from the past all those old habits, old schemes that weakened Ukraine for a very long time, for decades,” he said. Zelenskiy gave no details about who might be a target.</p><p><strong>Talks have started in Saudi Arabia to find a peaceful settlement to Russia’s war in Ukraine. </strong>It is hoped this weekend’s meeting of national security advisers and other senior officials from about 40 countries – but not Russia – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/aug/05/russia-ukraine-war-live-russian-tanker-hit-by-drones-saudi-arabia-talks-will-be-difficult-says-kyiv-envoy?page=with:block-64ce21238f08d95cff6bd287#block-64ce21238f08d95cff6bd287">will reach agreement on principles of how to end the conflict</a>.
