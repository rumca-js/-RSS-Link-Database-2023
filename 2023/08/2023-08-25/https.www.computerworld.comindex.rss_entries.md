<p>I found the Republican National Debate this week fascinating because, for once, it seemed to involve actual issues instead of regurgitated talking points. One comment caught my attention: it was an attack by former New Jersey Governor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWkJX8iA6ms" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Chris Christie on Vivek Ramaswamy implying he was a ChatGPT clone</a>.</p><p>This wasn’t true, of course, but would that necessarily be a bad thing?</p><p>The critique goes to the struggle education is having about whether the use of <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3683209/gpt-high-tech-parlor-trick-or-first-real-ai-for-everyday-use.html">ChatGPT</a> is somehow cheating and it mirrors similar concerns that using that generative AI tools for work are also cheating. (This brought back a memory of being a kid on a farm, painting miles of fence surrounding the property but being told I couldn’t use a spray paint rig because that made the work fun — and work shouldn’t be fun. I disagreed with then and still do now.)</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3705432/the-republican-debate-and-chatgpt-room-for-gen-ai-in-politics.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>It looks as if <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/87615/changes-to-uk-surveillance-regime-may-violate-international-law/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">people are at last waking up</a> to a second extraordinarily dangerous requirement buried within a UK government bill <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3703055/apple-proposed-uk-law-is-a-serious-direct-threat-to-security-privacy.html">designed to promote the nation as a surveillance state</a>. It means bureaucrats can delay or prevent distribution of essential software updates, making every computer user far less secure.</p><h2><strong>A poor law</strong></h2>
<p>This incredibly damaging limitation is just one of the many bad ideas buried in the UKs latest piece of shoddy tech regulation, the Investigatory Powers Act. What makes the law doubly dangerous is that in the online world, you are only ever as secure as your least secure friend, which means UK businesses will likely suffer by being flagged as running insecure versions of operating systems.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3705370/new-law-could-turn-uk-into-a-hackers-playground.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>Apple is continuing its <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3699353/apple-beefs-up-enterprise-identity-device-management.html">expansion of Managed Apple IDs for business customers</a>, giving them increased access to iCloud services and Apple Continuity features. Companies get iCloud backup and new syncing options (particularly for passwords, passkeys, and other enterprise credentials) — along with access to business-friendly Continuity features such as Universal Control.</p><p>But they could also lead to increased data sprawl and siloing. Ironically, those issues are typically related to shadow IT, even though they're enterprise features. Let's look at what's going on and how enterprises can take advantage of these features and services without running into trouble.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3705248/managed-apple-ids-icloud-and-the-shadow-it-connection.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
