Microsoft says these will offer both shortcuts to often-used settings, as well as give a bird&rsquo;s-eye view of your device and account status.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial release will show up to seven cards, with one dynamically generated based on how you&rsquo;ve been using your PC. More will be &ldquo;coming soon.&rdquo; Microsoft describes this first batch as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<ol>\n<li><strong><em>Recommended settings:</em></strong><em> This card adapts to your specific usage patterns, providing timely and relevant settings options. It&rsquo;s designed to streamline your settings management and save you time.</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><em>Cloud storage:</em></strong><em> Gives you an overview of your cloud storage use and lets you know when you&rsquo;re nearing capacity.</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><em>Account recovery:</em></strong><em> Helps keep your Microsoft account more secure by helping you add additional recovery info so you never get locked out of your account, even if you forget your password.</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><em>Personalization:</em></strong><em> Brings customization to the forefront by offering one-click access to update your background theme or change your color mode.</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><em>Microsoft 365:</em></strong><em> Provides a quick glimpse of your subscription status and benefits, along with the ability to take some key actions right in Settings instead of going to the web.</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><em>Xbox:</em></strong><em> Similar to the Microsoft 365 card, you&rsquo;ll be able to view your subscription status and manage the subscription from the Settings app.</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><em>Bluetooth Devices:</em></strong><em> To simplify your Bluetooth device management experience, we&rsquo;ve brought this to the forefront so you can quickly access and connect to your favorite Bluetooth-enabled devices.</em></li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"Windows 11 Settings homepage (preview build)\" class=\"wp-image-2043211\" height=\"694\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/settings-homepage.png?w=1200\" width=\"940\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The new Windows 11 Settings app homepage and its interactive cards.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Microsoft</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As an Windows Insider feature, this change to the Settings app is not guaranteed to make it to general release. However, many updates from the beta channel (as this one is) often do. Another notable inclusion in this build is the new <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1930130/windows-backup-app-debuts-alongside-a-taskbar-update-users-begged-for.html\">Backup and Restore app</a> announced earlier this year, which was previously only available through the dev channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the new Settings homepage should make it easier to tweak Windows 11, it does highlight how long the operating system has gone without simple ways to do so. Case in point, those Bluetooth settings, which have only gotten <em>more</em> complicated to access via keyboard shortcuts. It also remains to be seen how useful the new interactive cards will be for those not subscribed to Microsoft 365 or Xbox non-subscribers. Will those cards be replaceable with other cards in the future, or will they remain <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1790329/i-paid-for-microsoft-windows-why-does-it-push-ads-on-me.html\">permanent advertisements</a> for Microsoft&rsquo;s moneymakers?</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"get-windows-11-pro-dirt-cheap-in-pcworlds-software-store\">\n\t\t\t\t\tget windows 11 pro dirt cheap in pcworld's software store\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"windows-11-pro\">Windows 11 Pro</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Windows 11 Pro\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"1330\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Windows-Insider-search-bar.png\" width=\"2368\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__pricing-details  \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://software.pcworld.com/p43833-windows_11_professional\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$79.99 at  PCWorld Software Store</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\nWindows</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2043210/finally-windows-11-will-stop-making-you-hunt-so-hard-for-common-settings.html", "date_published": "2023-08-25T19:48:38.007429+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": "PC world", "album": "PC world", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "My favorite YouTube game reviews are short and sweet", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes you want to know everything you possibly can about a game before you buy it.

That&rsquo;s the philosophy behind The Escapist&rsquo;s 3 Minute Reviews, a series that I&rsquo;ve come to look forward to for every new YouTube episode. The videos are short, efficient, and entertaining&hellip;all the more so because they buck the annoying YouTube trend of spreading everything out to ten or twenty minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.escapistmagazine.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-2037469-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">The Escapist</a> has made a name for itself as a more cerebral and contemplative place for gaming content, less focused on the minute-to-minute breaking news than deeper looks at culture, trends, and business. If the name sounds familiar, it&rsquo;s probably because of <em><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9EaqEjR6QM&amp;list=PLAbMhAYRuCUhawCEV2oXZGrienoKTN16X&amp;xcust=2-1-2037469-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Zero Punctuation</a></em>, the foul-mouthed animated show that&rsquo;s been running weekly episodes for [glance at the calendar, <em>holy crap</em>] fifteen years now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAbMhAYRuCUiGHgCYOMTKht4RbFQOtVjP&amp;xcust=2-1-2037469-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">3 Minute Reviews</a></em> give that same bite-sized glance at a new game, but sans Yahtzee Croshaw&rsquo;s abrasive acerbity (I&rsquo;m a fan, but not everyone is!) and with a more holistic approach. The reviewers tend to narrate their own works, making them personal and opinionated as all reviews should be. They give just enough details on a game&rsquo;s structure and story to sink your teeth into.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the best part of the series is that it avoids covering huge, AAA games, and gives some much-needed attention to games that are smaller, shorter, or just from lesser-known developers. Often I&rsquo;ll click on a new entry never having heard of the game before, even though I keep a pretty close eye on the industry. It makes the playlist an informative and broad collection of opinions on games that you might not be exposed to otherwise.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the spirit of <em>3 Minute Reviews</em>, I&rsquo;ll keep my recommendation brief.

DLSS 3 leverages the tensor cores in RTX 40-series graphics cards to insert AI-generated frames between every traditionally rendered frame, which greatly increases frame rates and visual fluidity. AMD&rsquo;s FSR 3 is powered by &ldquo;Fluid Motion Frames&rdquo; technology that accomplishes a similar goal, but using more traditional frame interpolation rather than machine learning. It doesn&rsquo;t require dedicated AI hardware like DLSS 3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That lets FSR 3 run on many graphics cards and platforms alike &mdash; a key goal for AMD, whose APUs power the Xbox Series S/X and PlayStation 5 as well. AMD designed the open-source FSR 3 to be easy for game developers to include across all those platforms as well as the PC, and the technology is expected to be made open source like prior FSR implementations. FSR 3 will run on any Radeon graphics card from the RX 5000 series onward, or equivalent competitor GPUs, but AMD recommends using more modern Radeon RX 6000 and 7000 graphics cards for the best performance.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"fsr 3\" class=\"wp-image-2041817\" height=\"660\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/fsr-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">AMD</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of performance, AMD gave a hint of what to expect from FSR 3 in the game <em>Forspoken</em>, which will join <em>Immortals of Aveum</em> in debuting FSR 3 integration in September. With FSR 2&rsquo;s Super Resolution upscaling on and AMD&rsquo;s Fluid Motion Frames active, <em>Forspoken</em>&rsquo;s performance leaped from 36 frames per second at 4K with ultra-high ray tracing on all the way to 122fps. Wowza.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>FSR 3 also activates Radeon Anti-Lag+ to help combat the latency added by the inserted frames, similarly to how Nvidia requires DLSS 3 games to include Nvidia Reflex. With DLSS 3, the combination helps games become slightly more responsive, but nowhere near as reflexive as you&rsquo;d expect given the massive frame rate increase &mdash; because those inserted frames can&rsquo;t respond to your inputs like the normal ones do. I&rsquo;d expect FSR 3 to perform similarly.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"fsr 3\" class=\"wp-image-2041816\" height=\"661\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/fsr-3-native-aa.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">AMD</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Also like DLSS 3, AMD&rsquo;s FSR 3 gives you the option to activate Fluid Motion Frames <em>without</em> turning on the Super Resolution feature, using your game&rsquo;s chosen anti-aliasing mode instead. Doing so lets you enjoy the frame rate boost Fluid Motion Frames provides, but without the extra performance boost (and potential small visual downgrades) that upsampling provides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several other games are scheduled to integrate FSR 3 in the future, including heavy-hitters like <em>Cyberpunk 2077, Warhammer 40K: Space Marine II, </em>and <em>Frostpunk 2</em>. The technology will also be available as an Unreal Engine plugin soon, which should really throw open the flood gates for game support.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"fsr 3\" class=\"wp-image-2041815\" height=\"660\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/fsr-3-games.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">AMD</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&rsquo;s what you need to know about FSR 3 when it arrives in September. Developers will need to implement it in games. But here&rsquo;s a cool twist: AMD can run its Fluid Motion Frames technology at a driver level, letting it work with virtually <em>every </em>modern game in your library. Now that&rsquo;s exciting!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AMD plans to integrate Fluid Motion Frames into its <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2040505/amds-game-boosting-hyper-rx-feature-finally-arrives-with-a-surprise.html\">new performance-boosting Hyper-RX feature</a>, which is launching on September 6. The Fluid Motion Frames won&rsquo;t be in there to start, but will be added in the coming months. AMD also announced the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2040423/amds-radeon-rx-7700-xt-and-7800-xt-aim-at-nvidias-weakest-links.html\">Radeon RX 7700 XT and 7800 XT</a>, a pair of graphics cards targeting fast 1440p performance.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"amd-radeon-rx-7600\">AMD Radeon RX 7600</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"AMD Radeon RX 7600\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/AMD-radeon-rx-7600-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"3000\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t299 Euro\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\nGraphics Cards</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2041810/fsr-3-amds-open-dlss-3-rival-starts-supercharging-games-in-september.html", "date_published": "2023-08-25T16:33:12.075793+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": "PC world", "album": "PC world", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "AMD\u2019s Radeon RX 7700 XT and 7800 XT aim at Nvidia\u2019s weakest links", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>After weeks of <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2025596/radeon-rx-7700-xt-revealed-in-new-asrock-leak.html\">leaks</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2020523/powercolor-spills-the-beans-on-the-unannounced-radeon-rx-7800-xt.html\">full-blown accidental reveals</a>, it&rsquo;s finally official: AMD fleshed out its Radeon RX 7000-series today, introducing both the $499 Radeon RX 7800 XT and the $449 Radeon RX 7700 XT during a keynote from Germany&rsquo;s Gamescom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These graphics cards aim to deliver sublime 1440p gaming performance, with AMD claiming that its new duo outpunches Nvidia&rsquo;s rival RTX 4070 and 4060 Ti by a hefty margin in many games at maximum settings. The Radeon RX 7800 XT and 7700 XT manage to easily clear the hallowed 60 frames-per-second mark at 1440p/max in games where older GPUs like the Radeon RX 5700 XT and GeForce RTX 2070 Super are starting to show their age, like <em>The Last of Us</em> and <em>Star Wars: Jedi Survivor</em>.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Radeon RX 7700 XT and 7800 XT\" class=\"wp-image-2040424\" height=\"669\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/new-vs-old.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">AMD</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&rsquo;s without any of AMD&rsquo;s performance-boosting software features enabled. AMD also pulled back the curtain on the DLSS 3-like FSR 3 with Fluid Motion Frames at Gamescom, while finally unleashing its long-teased &ldquo;Hyper-RX&rdquo; feature to supercharge frame rates in other ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both graphics cards are built using AMD&rsquo;s modern 5nm RDNA 3 architecture and 6nm memory chiplets, along with the next generation of the company&rsquo;s on-die Infinity Cache (albeit in lower capacities than last gen). They also offer AV1 encoding and DisplayPort 2.1, with the latter being something missing in rival GeForce GPUs. You can read all about RDNA 3&rsquo;s capabilities in our <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1370428/amd-rdna-3-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-reveal.html\">review of the Radeon RX 7900 series</a>. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know about the Radeon RX 7800 XT and Radeon RX 7700 XT.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"amd-radeon-rx-7800-xt-specs\">AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT specs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the more powerful Radeon RX 7800 XT first. The specs:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Compute units: 60</li>\n\n\n\n<li>RT accelerators: 60</li>\n\n\n\n<li>AI accelerators: 120</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Game clock: 2124MHz</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Boost clock: 2430MHz</li>\n\n\n\n<li>GDDR6 memory: 16GB</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Memory bus: 256-bit</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Memory speed: 19.5Gbps</li>\n\n\n\n<li>AMD Infinity Cache: 64MB</li>\n\n\n\n<li>DisplayPort: 2.1</li>\n\n\n\n<li>AV1 hardware encoding: Yes</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Total board power: 263 watts</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Price: $499</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Keen-eyed graphics geeks will notice that with 60 compute units, the new Radeon RX 7800 XT actually matches the compute unit count of <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/393729/amd-radeon-rx-6800-rx-6800-xt-review.html\">last generation&rsquo;s Radeon RX 6800</a> and <em>not </em>the 6800 XT. The 6800 XT had 72 CUs, a substantial amount more, so it&rsquo;ll be interesting to see how much faster the new Radeon RX 7800 XT is than its predecessor &mdash; or if it even is. Hopefully AMD isn&rsquo;t pulling a pricey side-grade comparable to <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1925928/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-ti-8gb-review.html\">Nvidia&rsquo;s meh GeForce RTX 4060 Ti</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I asked about the difference in compute units during a press briefing ahead of Gamescom. Scott Olschewsky, Radeon&rsquo;s director of product management, said that when AMD looks at branding over generations, it doesn&rsquo;t take compute units into consideration &mdash; just performance and positioning. He said the number of CUs doesn&rsquo;t really matter when it comes to naming Radeon GPUs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The newer GPU can lean on higher clock speeds to help push performance, with the Radeon RX 7800 XT hitting a 2124MHz Game Clock and 2430MHz Boost Clock, compared to the 6800 XT&rsquo;s 2015MHz and 2250MHz, respectively. AMD claims the Radeon RX 7800 XT beats Nvidia&rsquo;s $600 RTX 4070 in a wide variety of games, though the GeForce card claims some healthy victories of its own in games with ray tracing enabled. AMD&rsquo;s ray tracing chops are much better than last gen but still can&rsquo;t go toe-to-toe with Nvidia&rsquo;s hardware in games that heavily use the intensive visual effects.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Radeon RX 7700 XT and 7800 XT\" class=\"wp-image-2040427\" height=\"665\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/4070.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">AMD</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>AMD&rsquo;s graphics card holds a crucial memory advantage over its rival as well, in an age when games are starting to gobble down ever-increasing amounts of RAM. The Radeon RX 7800 XT comes with a full 16GB of GDDR6 memory, compared to the RTX 4070&rsquo;s 12GB. Both should be plenty for playing most games at 1440p max settings, but as <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1780649/the-full-nerd-ep-251-is-8gb-of-vram-enough-and-bad-pc-gaming-ports.html\">recent events have shown</a>, you ideally want 16GB for full-fidelity 1440p gaming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, while the Radeon RX 7800 XT uses a bit less power than the 6800 XT, it consumes 14W <em>more</em> power than the Radeon RX 6800, which also had 60 CUs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"amd-radeon-rx-7700-xt-specs\">AMD Radeon RX 7700 XT specs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Onto the Radeon RX 7700 XT!</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Compute units: 54</li>\n\n\n\n<li>RT accelerators: 54</li>\n\n\n\n<li>AI accelerators: 108</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Game clock: 2171MHz</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Boost clock: 2544MHz</li>\n\n\n\n<li>GDDR6 memory: 12GB</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Memory bus: 192-bit</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Memory speed: 18Gbps</li>\n\n\n\n<li>AMD Infinity Cache: 48MB</li>\n\n\n\n<li>DisplayPort: 2.1</li>\n\n\n\n<li>AV1 hardware encoding: Yes</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Total board power: 245 watts</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Price: $449</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Radeon RX 7700 XT uses a cut-down version of the Radeon RX 7800 XT&rsquo;s die, sporting fewer compute units, a narrower memory bus, and less GDDR6 memory and Infinity Cache. In exchange, it hits slightly higher clock speeds and uses a bit less power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, while the Radeon RX 7800 XT has fewer compute units than its predecessor, the Radeon RX 7700 XT pushes comfortably ahead of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394249/amd-radeon-rx-6700-xt-review.html\">last-gen 6700 XT</a> (which remains an outstanding purchase in today&rsquo;s GPU market). The 6700 XT wields 40 CUs but the Radeon RX 7700 XT has 54. The new GPU has<em> much</em> lower clock speeds, however, hitting a 2171MHz average game clock versus the 6700 XT&rsquo;s 2424MHz.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The memory loadout remains consistent, offering 12GB of GDDR6 memory across a 192-bit bus. It&rsquo;s a major advantage over the $400 RTX 4060 Ti, which we can&rsquo;t recommend for 1440p gaming thanks to its paltry 8GB of VRAM and minuscule 128-bit bus. Nvidia&rsquo;s GPU landed with a resounding thud so AMD&rsquo;s new offering has a real chance at owning this segment of the market if performance is up to snuff.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Radeon RX 7700 XT and 7800 XT\" class=\"wp-image-2040426\" height=\"677\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/4060-ti.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">AMD</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Going off AMD&rsquo;s numbers, it certainly looks like it. AMD has a double-digit performance advantage in over half the games listed, and the Radeon RX 7700 XT meets or beats the 4060 Ti in some games that AMD said the 7800 XT loses to the 4070 in, such as <em>Dying Light 2</em> and<em> Spider-Man Miles Morales </em>with ray tracing on.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"filling-out-the-new-generation\">Filling out the new generation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At their bones, the memory configuration of the Radeon RX 7800 XT and 7700 XT look much better suited for long-term 1440p gaming than Nvidia&rsquo;s rival RTX 40-series GPUs, though the GeForce offerings will likely maintain a lead in ray traced games.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Radeon RX 7700 XT and 7800 XT\" class=\"wp-image-2040425\" height=\"655\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1440.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">AMD</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>All modern Radeon 7000 GPUs support AV1 encoding, DisplayPort 2.1, and AMD&rsquo;s killer suite of software features (like Smart Access Memory, Radeon Anti-Lag, Radeon Super Resolution, FSR, and more). To make these new Radeon GPUs even more tempting, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2041810/fsr-3-amds-open-dlss-3-rival-starts-supercharging-games-in-september.html\">AMD took the wraps off FSR 3</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2040505/amds-game-boosting-hyper-rx-feature-finally-arrives-with-a-surprise.html\">long-promised Hyper-RX feature</a> at Gamescom, with both pushing performance to blistering new heights with the help of DLSS 3-like &ldquo;AMD Fluid Motion Frames.&rdquo; Hit those links to learn more about each of the new features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AMD&rsquo;s new graphics cards hit the streets on September 6, and the company will even toss in a free copy of Bethesda&rsquo;s hotly anticipated <em>Starfield </em>with purchase. You&rsquo;ll be able to pick up an AMD-designed version of the Radeon RX 7800 XT alongside the usual blitz of custom boards, but the Radeon RX 7700 XT will only be available from AMD&rsquo;s GPU partners like Sapphire, XFX, and Asus.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><strong>Further reading: </strong><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/416006/the-best-graphics-cards-for-pc-gaming.html\">The best graphics cards for PC gaming</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\nGraphics Cards</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2040423/amds-radeon-rx-7700-xt-and-7800-xt-aim-at-nvidias-weakest-links.html", "date_published": "2023-08-25T16:33:12.074264+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": "PC world", "album": "PC world", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Can Starfield have DLSS? AMD comments on FSR exclusivity rumors", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Besthesda&rsquo;s <em>Starfield </em>is the biggest PC launch of the season, a NASA-punk RPG years in the making. But it&rsquo;s getting some heat from the PC gaming community, even as it comes in for a landing. The game&rsquo;s support for AMD&rsquo;s Fidelity Super Resolution upscaling, apparently to the exclusion of the similar DLSS and Intel XeSS, is causing a lot of prospective space explorers to cry foul. We&rsquo;ve got the official line on the controversy from AMD itself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The choice seems to be a business-focused one, as Bethesda has been working closely with AMD on the game&rsquo;s graphics tech for both PC and consoles (remember, both the Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 are built on AMD hardware). AMD is &ldquo;<em>Starfield&rsquo;s</em> Exclusive PC Partner,&rdquo; according to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amd.com/en/gaming/featured-games/starfield.html&amp;xcust=2-3-2036461-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">its promotional site and video</a>, both of which mention the game&rsquo;s FSR 2.0 support. Gamers read between the lines and assumed that Nvidia DLSS would not be supported.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That certainly seems to be the case as Starfield prepares for launch. A datamine of the game&rsquo;s pre-load assets <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/starfield/nvidia-dlss&amp;xcust=2-3-2036461-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">finds no mention of DLSS or XeSS</a>, though it&rsquo;s been confirmed that it&rsquo;ll use FSR 2.0. We asked AMD representatives to comment on Starfield&rsquo;s use of FSR as a priority upscaling technology. Here&rsquo;s what AMD told PCWorld in an official statement before the game&rsquo;s release:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&ldquo;<em>We cannot discuss specific contractual terms publicly.</em><br /><br /><em>As a reminder, FSR is the only upscaling solution that has been optimized to run on multiple GPU architectures and that works cross-platform (across PCs and consoles). This means that on day one, the benefits of FSR are available to practically all gamers running a modern GPU or game console. DLSS on the other hand is exclusive to NVIDIA hardware, and only a subset of their hardware on top of that.</em><br /><br /><em>In cross-platform titles and a small number of partner titles we have aligned with developers to prioritize and optimize FSR as their upscaling solution because it works on more hardware for the benefit of more gamers.</em><br /><br /><em>When a developer has asked to implement other upscaling technologies in their game, AMD has supported that choice.</em><br /><br /><em>AMD believes a vendor-agnostic, standards-based upscaling technology is the best option for game developers and gamers, and we look forward to other GPU providers adopting this approach.</em>&ldquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s assumed that some portion of the agreement that has AMD celebrating <em>Starfield </em>as a partnership product means that FSR is the premiere upscaling technology in the game. Hell, there&rsquo;s even <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amd.com/en/gaming/featured-games/starfield.html&amp;xcust=2-3-2036461-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">a <em>Starfield </em>special edition Radeon RX 7900 XTX coming out</a> to celebrate the launch. A small portion of the statement makes it seem like Bethesda may be able to add DLSS support to the game later: &ldquo;<em>When a developer has asked to implement other upscaling technologies in their game, AMD has supported that choice.</em>&rdquo; </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"starfield special edition rx 7900 xtx gpu\" class=\"wp-image-2041830\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/starfield-special-edition-rx-7900-xtx-gpu.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">AMD</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But AAA game development being the absolute money hole that it is, if Bethesda chose to implement DLSS and/or XeSS post-launch, that might be a very low priority behind initial support and DLC development.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re upset that <em>Starfield </em>doesn&rsquo;t support DLSS at launch, this statement is unlikely to mollify you. FSR does indeed work across all current graphics cards, mirroring the hardware-agnostic approach AMD took for <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/423202/g-sync-vs-freesync-amd-nvidia-monitor.html\">FreeSync versus G-sync</a>. But if you&rsquo;ve spent four digits on a GPU for your 4K gaming machine, settling for the multi-platform solution instead of the one with hardware dedicated to it might feel like a de facto snub.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, I find it hard to get up any bile for AMD or Bethesda for this decision, even as someone who runs an Intel-Nvidia hardware setup. It&rsquo;s a business move &mdash; it seems clear that AMD offered Bethesda more value, by whatever measure was being used, than Nvidia. For a counter-example, Nvidia has been <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1498499/cyberpunk-2077-levels-up-framwerates-with-nvidia-dlss-3.html\">using <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> as a showcase</a> for every new bit of graphics tech it&rsquo;s developed since the game&rsquo;s launch. And that&rsquo;s neither good nor bad, it&rsquo;s just a reality of the gaming world. The same reality that means the PS5 isn&rsquo;t getting <em>Starfield </em>at all, since <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/393528/microsoft-buys-bethesda-creator-of-doom-fallout-elder-scrolls-and-quake.html\">Bethesda was purchased by Microsoft in 2021</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And those who demand DLSS will have options. Previous games that didn&rsquo;t have official support were later modded with the capability, including the notoriously fickle <em>Elden Ring</em> and <em>Starfield&rsquo;s </em>predecessors like <em>Skyrim </em>and <em>Fallout 4</em>. In fact, at least one modder has committed to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/starfield/dlss-3-mod&amp;xcust=2-3-2036461-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">adding it to the game ASAP after launch</a>.</p>\n\nGraphics Cards</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2036461/amd-comments-on-starfield-fsr-controversy.html", "date_published": "2023-08-25T16:33:12.072674+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": "PC world", "album": "PC world", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "AMD\u2019s game-boosting Hyper-RX feature finally arrives (with a surprise)", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of a Gamescom announcement blitz that also saw the reveal of new <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2040423/amds-radeon-rx-7700-xt-and-7800-xt-aim-at-nvidias-weakest-links.html\">Radeon RX 7700 XT and 7800 XT graphics cards</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2041810/fsr-3-amds-open-dlss-3-rival-starts-supercharging-games-in-september.html\">FSR 3.0</a>, AMD finally delivered on its long-promised Hyper-RX feature &mdash; complete with a surprise twist that builds and expands on FSR 3.0&rsquo;s key technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AMD first teased Hyper-RX all the way back in November 22. It&rsquo;s not actually a new feature, per se; instead, it&rsquo;s a singular switch that activates Radeon Software&rsquo;s existing <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/623910/amd-adrenalin-radeon-super-resolution-is-here-to-speed-up-your-games.html\">Radeon Super Resolution</a>, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3uCyhKWGyc&amp;xcust=2-3-2040505-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Radeon Boost</a>, and Radeon Anti-Lag technologies all in one go to drastically improve both frame rates and responsiveness in games.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"rx\" class=\"wp-image-2040507\" height=\"659\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/rx-button.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">AMD</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Radeon Super Resolution is essentially a simplified version of AMD&rsquo;s performance-boosting FSR 1.0 upscaling technology. Radeon Boost builds upon that by intelligently lowering the resolution when fast on-screen user movement is detected, helping increase performance when the action is hot and heavy (and you&rsquo;re unlikely to notice a reduced resolution). Radeon Anti-Lag improves CPU pacing in GPU-bound games to increase click-to-response times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Flipping the Hyper-RX switch activates all three. In tandem, AMD says, Hyper-RX delivers deeply tangible gaming improvements, as you can see in the chart below.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"rx\" class=\"wp-image-2040508\" height=\"664\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/rx-perf.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">AMD</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that Radeon Boost is only available in select games, and that includes all the games in the chart above. Even with Radeon Super Resolution and Anti-Lag active, however, your games should feel significantly faster, albeit possibly with a slight downgrade in visual quality (especially if you&rsquo;re playing at 1080p resolution).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hyper-RX will make its debut in a new Radeon Software driver releasing on September 6, alongside the Radeon RX 7700 XT and 7800 XT. But what&rsquo;s coming in a later update is even more exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"hyper-rx-gets-amd-fluid-motion-frames\">Hyper-RX gets AMD Fluid Motion Frames</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The secret sauce in AMD&rsquo;s FidelityFX Super Resolution 3.0 (FSR 3.0) is the addition of &ldquo;AMD Fluid Motion Frames.&rdquo; Like <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1662185/what-is-dlss-3-nvidia-geforce-rtx-ai-feature-explained.html\">Nvidia&rsquo;s vaunted DLSS 3</a>, AMD&rsquo;s solution interpolates frames between the frames natively generated by your graphics card, only without the need for dedicated AI hardware as it doesn&rsquo;t rely on machine learning. Doing so greatly increases your overall frame rate and visual smoothness thanks to all those &ldquo;fake&rdquo; frames.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing though: While FSR 3 and DLSS 3 require active integration by game developers, AMD says its Fluid Motion Frames technology does <em>not</em>. That means it can be baked into Radeon Software at a driver level and used for virtually all games, numbering thousands of titles. So the company plans to include Fluid Motion Frames into Hyper-RX at some point in the future to increase performance even more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Whoa</em>.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"rx\" class=\"wp-image-2040509\" height=\"664\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/rx-fmf.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">AMD</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>AMD didn&rsquo;t delve into the nitty-gritty details of how Fluid Motion Frames works or promise a timeline on when its coming to Hyper-RX, nor have we seen FSR 3 in action to gauge its quality, but that&rsquo;s a <em>very</em> enticing feature on paper. Being able to flip on a DLSS 3-like technology in almost <em>any </em>game could mean big things for everyday gaming for Radeon owners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Better yet, since &ldquo;fake&rdquo; frames can decrease responsiveness, it needs to be balanced by a lag-reduction feature. There&rsquo;s a reason Nvidia Reflex is mandatory in DLSS 3 games. As part of the Hyper-RX suite, Fluid Motion Frames will naturally be paired with AMD&rsquo;s own Radeon Anti-Lag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exciting times. I can&rsquo;t wait to play around with Hyper-RX myself, and see how those Fluid Motion Frames handle in FSR 3.0.

This is what truly makes a wireless keyboard a <em>gaming </em>keyboard, more so than fancy lighting or programming options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more tips about what to look for in a wireless gaming keyboard, scroll to our buying guide below our list of recommendations.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart product-chart\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-separator\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart-item product-chart-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper--title product-chart-title \" id=\"razer-blackwidow-v3-pro-best-wireless-gaming-keyboard-overall\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRazer BlackWidow V3 Pro &ndash; Best wireless gaming keyboard overall\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"large-pro-cons-product-chart-section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproduct-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper--large\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Razer BlackWidow V3 Pro - Best wireless gaming keyboard overall\" class=\"product-chart-item__image\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/blackwidow-v3-pro.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1500\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-columns\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tSuper-smooth switches&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tGreat media controls&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tComfy wrist rest&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tExpensive&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tABS keycaps are a little cheap\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__information \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>The latest in a long line of high-end keyboards called BlackWidow, this particular model pulls out all the stops.

This one&rsquo;s still mechanical though, so it has that great typing and gaming feel with a bit less key travel. The big, finger-friendly volume wheel is particularly nice. There are thinner options out there, like the Corsair KIOO Air, but it&rsquo;s both more expensive and less comfortable. The Deathstalker V2 also comes in a TKL size if you don&rsquo;t need a num pad.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1438527/razer-deathstalker-v2-pro-review-big-keyboards-are-thin-again.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRazer Deathstalker V2 Pro keyboard review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ad page-ad has-ad-prefix ad-article\"></div>\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-separator\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart-item product-chart-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper--title product-chart-title \" id=\"redragon-k596-wireless-keyboard-best-budget-option\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRedragon K596 Wireless Keyboard &ndash; Best budget option\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"large-pro-cons-product-chart-section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproduct-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper--large\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Redragon K596 Wireless Keyboard - Best budget option\" class=\"product-chart-item__image\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/60283_P_1629785783837.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1500\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-columns\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tLow price\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tIncluded wrist rest\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tLong battery life\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tVolume wheel\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tUgly keycaps\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tCan only program G keys\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tNo Bluetooth\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__information \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-label\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"not-amp\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.gamestop.com/s/gamestop-us/pc-gaming/keyboards/products/redragon-k596-vishnu-2.4g-wireless-wired-rgb-tenkeyless-mechanical-gaming-keyboard/298719.html?sku=11150612.html&amp;xcust=2-3-835195-6-829919-17281&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$79.99 at  Gamestop</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>If you need a wireless gaming keyboard for under a C-note, Redragon (pronounced &ldquo;re-dragon,&rdquo; maybe, who knows?) is happy to provide.

Expect to pay a significant premium over wired designs, at least when looking at multiple models from the same category or brand. More personal and subjective features, like the feel of mechanical switches, might necessitate a trip to your local electronics store (or tracking down a handy key switch tester for trying dozens at once). </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wireless-options\">Wireless options</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Gaming keyboards tend to use RF wireless with a USB dongle, instead of a Bluetooth connection, which is more popular with modern &ldquo;standard&rdquo; wireless keyboards. That&rsquo;s because it allows manufacturers to use a more reliable, direct connection, with a higher polling rate&mdash;that means the connection between the board and your computer refreshes itself much more often, minimizing input lag. Some advanced models still include Bluetooth, along with fancier options like pairing multiple devices to the same USB dongle. Range typically isn&rsquo;t a concern if you&rsquo;re using a keyboard with a gaming desktop, but you might want to think about it if you have a gaming PC hooked up to your TV. <br /><br />Most high-end wireless gaming keyboards can also use a direct wired USB connection, if you&rsquo;re worried about wireless interference in a crowded environment. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"key-switches\">Key switches</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern mechanical keyboards come in a staggering array of switch varieties, from smooth and linear to loud and clickly, with tons of options for mechanisms and spring strength. The only real way to know which one you prefer is to try &rsquo;em out (retail store displays are great for this). That being said, more expensive keyboards tend to come with nicer, high-quality switches from name brands like Cherry and Gateron. For the ultimate in customization, track down a keyboard with hotswap switches, which let you swap out the switches for new and different ones whenever you want. <br /><br />Recently more advanced types of switches have emerged, like optical and &ldquo;laser&rdquo; switches tripped by interrupting a beam of light, or &ldquo;mag lev&rdquo; switches that allow you to adjust the force it takes to activate the key. These are interesting, but tend to lack actual utility (unless you have truly superhuman perception), and increase the price of keyboards phenomenally. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"keycaps\">Keycaps</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Keycaps are the little pieces of plastic that sit on top of the switches&mdash;what your fingers press down on. Switching out the keycaps for a set of nicer ones, maybe made of better PBT plastic or themed after your favorite TV show, is a popular and easy keyboard mod. Some keyboard makers even sell their own upgrade sets. Keycaps with a Cherry MX-compatible stem will work with almost all modern mechanical switches, just make sure you find a set that matches the layout of your keyboard. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"battery-life\">Battery life</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike gaming mice, battery life generally isn&rsquo;t a big concern with gaming keyboards. They&rsquo;re big enough that there&rsquo;s plenty of space for internal batteries that last for weeks, or even months, between charges. That is, unless you over-use that fancy RGB lighting with dazzling animation&hellip;in which case, it might last just a few days or hours. If it&rsquo;s available, check the milliamp-hour (mAh) rating for the battery. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"layout\">Layout </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The layout of the keys on your keyboard varies more than you might think. Full-sized keyboards include a 10-key area to the right of the arrow cluster, but gaming models often omit this in order to make more room for mouse movements, calling this the &ldquo;10-key-less&rdquo; layout. Some keyboards go even smaller, with 60% being the smallest that mainstream brands use, chopping off the Function row, 10-key area, and even the arrow keys (which have to be accessed via a Fn button). A few designs go even larger than the full layout, with an extra column or two of programmable keys for custom bindings or macros. Which one you want comes down to a matter of available space and, perhaps more pertinently, taste. <br /><br />These general layouts shouldn&rsquo;t be confused with country- and region-specific key layouts, like ANSI and ISO. Most popular designs are available in at least those two variants. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"lighting\">Lighting </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Even budget gaming keyboards come with LED backlights these days, though they might not be the full programable, device-synced light show that companies like Razer and Corsair delight in. Unless you&rsquo;re constantly playing in the dark and you can&rsquo;t touch-type, it&rsquo;s entirely cosmetic. It&rsquo;s fun, that&rsquo;s about it. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"extras\">Extras </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Keyboard makers are forever trying to one-up each other with extra features. For a mechanical board you can generally expect a removable USB cable (maybe a braided one for nicer boards), and possibly an included keycap puller and wrist rest. Larger boards usually include dedicated media controls, and the nicer ones get a fully programmable wheel or knob. An especially nice option is on-device memory, allowing you to keep key layout programs without running a driver program on each new computer. </p>\n\nGaming, Keyboards</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/835195/best-wireless-gaming-keyboards.html", "date_published": "2023-08-25T16:33:12.069449+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": "PC world", "album": "PC world", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "21 Xbox PC Game Pass games come to Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>As long-promised, Nvidia&rsquo;s GeForce Now streaming service just added something worth getting excited about.

The conflicts on the desert planet of Kharak can therefore get pretty stressful. Instead of the spaceships common in the series, tanks and infantry are commanded in this spin-off. Flying units are also part of the repertoire, but <em>Deserts of Kharak</em> is far removed from the sprawling space battles with countless spaceships of the predecessors. It still feels like <em>Homeworld</em>, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A total of 13 missions are available in the campaign, and there&rsquo;s a multiplayer mode with five maps divided among two, four, or six armies. The desert setting is relatively dull, but the units are very detailed for the time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The story told in cutscenes entertains well, the exciting and varied missions are also convincing. <em>Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak</em> is well worth your time and the campaign lasts a good 10 to 15 hours. A round or two with friends is also worthwhile, though the low map count might bore you after a bit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/homeworld-deserts-of-kharak&amp;xcust=2-1-2042992-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak free of charge in the Epic Store</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article was translated from German to English and originally appeared on pcwelt.de.</em></p>\n\nGaming, Windows</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2042992/epic-games-strategy-cracker-currently-available-for-free.html", "date_published": "2023-08-25T15:28:35.755210+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": "PC world", "album": "PC world", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Asus ROG Harpe Ace Aim Lab Edition review: A powerful esports mouse", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n<div class=\"review\" id=\"review-body\"><img alt=\"Editors' Choice\" class=\"review-logo\" src=\"https://www.pcworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PC-ED-CHOICE.png\" /><span class=\"review-title\">At a glance</span><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"experts-rating\">Expert's Rating</h3><div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n<div><div class=\"review-columns\"><div class=\"review-column\"><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"pros\">Pros</h3><ul class=\"pros review-list\"><li>36,000 DPI sensor is extremely powerful and accurate</li><li>Weighs just 54 grams</li><li>Tri-Mode connectivity means it&rsquo;s highly versatile </li></ul></div><div class=\"review-column\"><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"cons\">Cons</h3><ul class=\"cons review-list\"><li>Buttons aren&rsquo;t very audible</li><li>Left-side buttons are a little small</li><li>No 4000Hz HyperPolling </li></ul></div></div></div><h3 class=\"review-subTitle review-subTitle--borderTop\" id=\"our-verdict\">Our Verdict</h3><p class=\"verdict\">The ROG Harpe Ace Aim Lab Edition is one of the best esports mice you can currently buy.

It weighs just 54 grams, yet amazingly it boasts Tri-Mode connectivity, offering you the option of Bluetooth as well as a wired or 2.4GHz Wi-Fi connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As far as performance goes this mouse&rsquo;s 36,000 DPI sensor is one of the most precise and accurate we&rsquo;ve ever used. Its symmetrical body delivers a precision control we&rsquo;ve been looking for in competitive mice for some time now. It&rsquo;s with those thoughts we can say the ROG Harpe Ace Aim Lab Edition is an exceptional choice for gamers, having just about everything you&rsquo;d wish for in a gaming mouse for the fastest competitive play.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><strong>Further reading:</strong> See our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/559298/best-wireless-gaming-mice.html\">best gaming mice</a> to learn about competing products.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rog-harpe-ace-aim-lab-edition-design\">ROG Harpe Ace Aim Lab Edition design</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Collaborations can push products to new and exciting levels. You can see that&rsquo;s the case with the ROG Harpe Ace whose design is refreshingly minimalist, a device honed for gamers who need a reliable high-performance mouse. Asus claims the mouse was co-designed and tested by professional esports players, which would account for why it just feels so perfect for FPS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By far the most glaringly obvious feature is its light weight. I say that a lot these days as companies keep making lighter gaming mice for me to try out, but in the Harpe Ace&rsquo;s case its loftiness is a true tour de force worth celebrating. I mean, to make a mouse just 54 grams &mdash; lighter than a tennis ball &mdash; with Tri-Mode connectivity (a wired connection as well as 2.4GHz Wi-Fi and Bluetooth) is quite a feat of engineering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The secret sauce to that weightlessness is in the material used for the mouse&rsquo;s top. It&rsquo;s made of nylon, yet it looks and feels indistinguishable from plastic. Remarkably, it&rsquo;s nothing like the nylon you&rsquo;ll see in a beaten-down pair of swimming togs &mdash; it&rsquo;s extremely strong, neither creaking nor buckling under the weight of my hand. This nylon is naturally grippy too, with a texture somewhere between completely smooth and fine sandpaper. Asus has also added extra grips on both of the mouse&rsquo;s flanks for even more gripping power.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>You can make minute movements and achieve the same distance as you might with larger hand movements in other mice. This gives you a time advantage, and if you have a time advantage, however slight, you&rsquo;re already ahead of the competition.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Harpe Ace is shaped like most esports mice in that it&rsquo;s extremely symmetrical &mdash; one side looking identical to the other. Clearly this is a mouse meant to have laser-like precision, to be an unstoppable weapon in first-person shooters. It&rsquo;s also a mouse that will fit all the main grip types. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s featureless. From the back a gentle hump rises up to the mid-section and then tapers off toward the front. It also has straighter sides and a longer fit near the fingers than some of its esports rivals. It measures 5.02 x 2.51 x 1.56 inches, which comfortably fits most medium to large hands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The button configuration is extremely simple, offering up zero distractions that could cost you a frag. This minimalism is reminiscent of mice like the Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro and Logitech G Pro X Superlight. You get just five buttons on the top. These consist of two small left side buttons, two beautifully proportioned main clicks and a single click in the mouse wheel. Underneath you&rsquo;ll find a DPI button, a Bluetooth paring button and a button to switch connectivity settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Harpe Ace&rsquo;s motion is clearly smoother than other competitive gaming mice thanks to generous PTFE feet on the underside. That term &ldquo;PTFE feet&rdquo; is used quite loosely these days. In fact, what you often get instead are slim-line strips of PTFE located at the fore and aft of the mouse&rsquo;s bottom &mdash; but not in this case. No, the Harpe Ace has large triangular shaped patches that provide just that bit of extra glide on surfaces. Around the sensor is a generous ring of PTFE, too, reducing the impact of your hand&rsquo;s weight where it&rsquo;s at its heaviest.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"ROG Harpe Ace Aim Lab Edition\" class=\"wp-image-2032533\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Underside.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><p>Generous patches of PTFE on the ROG Harpe Ace Aim Lab Edition&rsquo;s underside allow it glide smoothly over surfaces. &nbsp;</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Other notable features include a single programmable RGB lighting zone inside the mouse wheel. This contrasted nicely against the dusky matte-black color of my review mouse, providing some greatly appreciated eye candy in low lighting. The mouse wheel itself feels remarkably tactile too, in that the rubber caught the end of my finger easily, eliminating any annoying slippage while I was spinning it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-does-the-rog-harpe-ace-aim-lab-edition-perform\">How does the ROG Harpe Ace Aim Lab Edition perform?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The ROG Harpe Ace Aim Lab Edition&rsquo;s 36,000 DPI (dots per inch) optical sensor is one of the highest-resolution sensors to cross my review bench. Be that as it may, it&rsquo;s also a spectacular performer &mdash; both extremely powerful and precise. But don&rsquo;t take my word for it; Asus claims this next-gen sensor has a less than 1 percent CPI (counts per inch) deviation, which means it&rsquo;s one of the most sensitive you can find.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consequently, you can keep your movements extremely tight &mdash; it reacts to the tiniest jolts, something competitive gamers will undoubtedly put to good use. You can make minute movements and achieve the same distance as you might with larger hand movements in other mice. This gives you a time advantage, and if you have a time advantage, however slight, you&rsquo;re already ahead of the competition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Breaking things down in a game of <em>Fortnite </em>and on lower DPI settings, the Harpe Ace sniped perfectly, allowing my crosshairs to fall effortlessly on the tiny far away targets that strafed into my scope. On higher DPI settings, however, the Harpe Ace was even better still. It easily handled me weaving in and out of buildings, while simultaneously switching weapons and turning around to watch my six &mdash; a combination of moves that can be all too much for some esports mice.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"ROG Harpe Ace Aim Lab Edition\" class=\"wp-image-2032561\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Side-on.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><p>The nylon material that makes up the Harpe Ace&rsquo;s body is not only very lightweight, it also provides excellent grip.&nbsp;</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In tense action, when I tend to get a little overzealous and clinch the mouse too hard, the Harpe Ace didn&rsquo;t lose any of its accuracy. Its symmetrical body and sturdy straight sides meant it didn&rsquo;t jolt left or right when I fired, which meant there was a lot less miss-hitting, something that can drive me up the wall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Harpe Ace also felt exceptionally smooth. It slid around my mouse mat without that catching sensation that I sometimes get. Having a little extra length where my fingers sat was also a big bonus &mdash; especially after long gaming sessions where my fingers sometimes feel a little creaky. Not here. My fingers felt fresh and relaxed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Harpe Ace&rsquo;s buttons felt nice and reactive too. They&rsquo;re not as audible as you&rsquo;ll find in mice like the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1663595/razer-deathadder-v3-pro-gaming-mouse-review.html\">Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro</a>, so if you&rsquo;re the kind of gamer that likes to listen closely to your buttons&rsquo; clicks, you may be a bit disappointed. Still, most esports players are going to have two pairs of headphones on anyway so that&rsquo;s unlikely to be an issue for them. Thankfully, there was no stickiness in the button switches, which seemed very responsive to my clicks.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-half-width is-float-right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"mentioned-in-this-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\tMentioned in this article&hellip;\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"razer-deathadder-v3-pro\">Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"3024\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/20230318_081159.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"4032\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__pricing-details  \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.razer.com/gaming-mice/Razer-DeathAdder-V3-Pro/RZ01-04630200-R3U1&amp;xcust=2-1-2032449-5-1663583-10700&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$149.99 at  Razer</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>Overall, I was well pleased with the Harpe Ace for my FPS gaming. Yet as good as it was, I would still change on niggling thing &mdash; the size and positioning of the left side buttons. They&rsquo;re quite small and their center positioning makes them a little hard to hit. I would have made them just a tad longer, and thereby a little easier to fire off my ancillary commands.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rog-harpe-ace-aim-lab-edition-software\">ROG Harpe Ace Aim Lab Edition software</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The software program, Aim Labs, hasn&rsquo;t been exclusively made for use with the Harpe Ace, but considering Aim Lab was one of the mouse&rsquo;s design partners, you&rsquo;re encouraged to give it try. After downloading it for free from Steam, you&rsquo;ll want to find the settings optimizer. Here you&rsquo;ll be directed through a series of aiming tests and settings recommendations designed to elevate you and your mouse&rsquo;s performance. On the whole, Aim Labs is a helpful tool that, if anything, helps you practice your aiming and familiarize yourself with your mouse&rsquo;s feel &mdash; which is a transferable skill to competition, like any kind of sports practice.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"ROG Harpe Ace Aim Lab Edition\" class=\"wp-image-2032799\" height=\"641\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Aim-Labs.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><p>Aim Labs settings optimizer is a software tool that helps you optimize your mouse&rsquo;s settings and playstyle for better performance.&nbsp;</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As fun as Aim Labs is, though, most of your settings changes can be done using Asus&rsquo;s Armoury Crate software. Here you can tweak DPI, choose a preferred polling rate up to a maximum 1,000Hz, and modify the mouse&rsquo;s acceleration and deceleration settings. You can also change the color of the RGB lighting in the Harpe Ace&rsquo;s mouse wheel and apply a range of dazzling effects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One whole submenu is also dedicated to surface calibration, a feature you don&rsquo;t often see in competitor apps. This feature lets you calibrate your mouse to work with a number of known mousepads, or else you can manually calibrate your mouse for a more bespoke feel. You can also vary the mouse&rsquo;s lift-off distance. Mind you, Armoury Crate only lets you choose between low and high lift-off distances, which is considerably less than you can choose from in Razer&rsquo;s Synapse app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Harpe Ace has four programmable onboard profiles. Once you&rsquo;ve assigned your preferred commands, changing between them is as simple as holding down the DPI button on the mouse&rsquo;s underside while simultaneously pressing one of the Harpe Ace&rsquo;s five mouse buttons. You can also extend the Harpe Ace&rsquo;s generous 90-hour battery life (79 hours with RGB lighting switched on and the default effect setting) by adjusting a few power settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-does-the-rog-harpe-ace-aim-lab-edition-compare-in-value\">How does the ROG Harpe Ace Aim Lab Edition compare in value?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The ROG Harpe Ace Aim Lab Edition costs $149.99, which isn&rsquo;t all that unusual for an esports mouse. What&rsquo;s unusual is that it weighs just 54 grams and has all three connectivity options &mdash; two features that you&rsquo;d be very lucky to find in any other esports mouse even at this premium price point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, there&rsquo;s the 51-gram Glorious Series One Pro Wireless, which is slightly lighter and currently costs $99, yet it only has Wi-Fi connectivity and no Bluetooth. Then there&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1987896/hyperx-pulsefire-haste-2-wireless-review.html\">HyperX&rsquo;s Pulsefire Haste 2 Wireless</a> which costs $89.99 and has both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi but adds an extra 7 grams of weight to make 61 grams, which does make it feel somewhat heavier and slower to move by comparison.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking at other hot esports contenders from 2022 and 2023, like the Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro and the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1475704/logitech-g-pro-x-superlight-wireless-gaming-mouse-review.html\">Logitech G Pro X Superlight</a>, you find that despite being excellent esports mice they also lack Bluetooth. They&rsquo;re also a little heavier than the Harpe Ace, racking up more than 60 grams a piece.

Who wouldn&rsquo;t be intrigued by a 49-inch curved widescreen monitor with a full 32:9 aspect ratio, or two regular 16:9 screens side by side. Its colorful and slightly curved OLED panel, high resolution, high frame rate, and well-below-millisecond response time suggested that a brilliant gaming experience was within reach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Further reading:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1470449/best-ultrawide-monitors.html\">Best utlrawide monitors</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"odyssey-oled-g9-specs\">Odyssey OLED G9 specs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, this display is decadent.

The curved surface on the back of the display is really nice too, and when the power is switched on, an RGB ring illuminates the area where the neck meets the back. The placement of the image inputs on the back isn&rsquo;t great, and can be very tricky to work with. The screen can be raised slightly and tilted backwards, but cannot be adjusted in other ways. A pivot function on such a wide screen would have been insanely cool, but Samsung hasn&rsquo;t been so daring this time.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Samsung Odyssey Oled G9 fr&aring;n sidan\" class=\"wp-image-2038093\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/P_20230821_152235.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1170\" width=\"1170\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Viewing angles are not a problem for an OLED screen, unless reflections cause problems, and the Odyssey OLED G9 handles them well.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mattias Inghe</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-does-the-odyssey-oled-g9-perform\">How does the Odyssey OLED G9 perform?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Was it worth the wait? Yes, I think so. I loaded up with as many spectacular immersive games as I could think of, and pushed the RTX 4070 card in my computer to its limits to render the action on the screen in the best quality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s hard to argue that an extreme widescreen doesn&rsquo;t effect gameplay favorably. With FOV settings set correctly in the games and at the right distance from the screen, I get a field of view that greatly increases peripheral vision and immersion. It took some experimentation and some vertigo-like motion sickness to get the angles right. But it&rsquo;s well worth it when everything is aligned just right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enemies appearing out of the corner of my eye in <em>Doom Eternal</em>, allowing me to react faster than with a narrower (and slower) screen. A full field-of-view of landscapes and environments that makes it easier to navigate&hellip; or simply stop and soak up the dystopian atmosphere in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and watch a sunset, or sweep your eyes over the horizon in <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>. Or why not take to the skies in <em>Flight Simulator</em> and watch the planet curve as you rise?</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Samsung Odyssey Oled G9 spel\" class=\"wp-image-2038096\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/P_20230821_212918.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Connected to a good gaming PC, you can get both fast and beautiful images.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mattias Inghe</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"top-class-colors-and-good-hdr\">Top-class colors and good HDR</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s not just a wide picture that adds to the experience, but it helps that the picture looks good too. The Odyssey OLED G9 is based on the same QD-OLED technology as Samsung&rsquo;s excellent OLED-based TVs, and that&rsquo;s reflected in its wide color gamut and high intensity. It crosses the DCI P3 color scale and starts to approach Rec. 2020 levels. Almost, but not quite. And it hits quite right in colors in P3 mode and just right for sRGB. It&rsquo;s so close to professional level for colors that anyone who wants to edit film and photos on the screen needs to be very picky not to be satisfied with this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With OLED, dark surfaces get intense blacks, and contrast down to the smallest pixel level is 100 percent. The screen is said to have 250 cd/m2 in normal type brightness, and that seems to be true on a large, all-white surface. I get the same value of 248 cd/m2 across the entire surface. But it also has a stated maximum brightness of up to 1000 cd/m2 for small and short-term light spots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can&rsquo;t measure this, but films and games in HDR mode clearly produce more intense local and short-term light. The screen has the same HDR support as most Samsung TVs, HDR10 and HDR10+ including the gaming version, but no Dolby Vision. It is also Vesa DisplayHDR True Black 400 certified.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Samsung Odyssey Oled G9 game hub\" class=\"wp-image-2038097\" height=\"694\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/P_20230821_213523.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">A special interface activated in the screen&rsquo;s gaming mode allows you to optimize the picture and features for your gaming. </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mattias Inghe</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"perfect-for-gaming-good-for-other-things\">Perfect for gaming, good for other things</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The 240Hz frame rate and support for Adaptive Sync and FreeSync Premium Pro make it easy to get a smooth and beautiful image, even when a computer struggles to keep the image rendering smooth. I didn&rsquo;t experience any screen tearing, even with fast movements and camera sweeps. If you have a new Nvidia GeForce graphics card, you don&rsquo;t need G-Sync in the display anymore; Adaptive Sync is fine. Lightning-fast response times of 0.03 milliseconds make the display just right for gaming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This requires a computer that can handle it. My fairly fast test box with Intel Core i5 processor and Geforce RTX 4070 can deliver 60 frames per second in most games, but not all. Still, that&rsquo;s a lot of pixels to control. The 5120&times;1440 pixel resolution means 7.3 million pixels. A 4K screen at 3840&times;2160 yields 8.3 million.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s not just games that can benefit from the big screen, but lots of workspace is a great advantage for other things too. You can stretch the video editor to accommodate a clear timeline and many windows and tools at once, and still have room for a browser and file manager. This is literally two &ldquo;regular&rdquo; 1440p 16:9 monitors side by side.  </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><strong>Further reading:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/813301/best-gaming-monitors.html\">Best gaming monitors</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Samsung Odyssey Oled G9 multitasking\" class=\"wp-image-2038094\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/P_20230821_152520.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">There&rsquo;s a lot of room on the screen.

To do so, the monitor has a DisplayPort and two HDMI inputs, one normal-sized and one micro-HDMI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s a format I haven&rsquo;t seen in a while, and almost feels a bit retro. What uses the micro-HDMI port like this in 2023? It would have seemed more logical to have a USB-C input for image signal, preferably one with power supply and full USB docking for a laptop. But you&rsquo;ll have to do without that. There are three USB-C ports, but they are a traditional USB hub and nothing else. One to connect to a computer and two to connect USB accessories. Again, an odd choice of port format. What I would like to connect is mostly USB Type A inputs for things like keyboard and mouse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And maybe a good headset. The screen has built-in speakers, but the sound experience is far from the glory of the picture experience. There are two 5-watt elements placed at the bottom edge of the screen outwards on each side. You get nice stereo spread and detailed sound, but it&rsquo;s still pretty thin, with flattened midrange and weak bass. There&rsquo;s no analogue headphone jack&mdash;you&rsquo;ll have to use a USB plug or Bluetooth.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Samsung Odyssey Oled G9 anslutningar\" class=\"wp-image-2038092\" height=\"758\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/P_20230821_152740.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The connections are not so many and a bit difficult to access. </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mattias Inghe</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"almost-a-smart-tv\">Almost a smart TV</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, the screen has Bluetooth 5.3 support, and also Wi-Fi 5 connectivity. This is one of Samsung&rsquo;s smart screens. With an Arm-based processor and the same Tizen OS software as in Samsung&rsquo;s smart TV. The functionality is the same as the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/785960/samsung-smart-monitor-m8-review.html\">Smart Monitor M8</a> screen we tested in 2022&mdash;a full smart TV system with pre-installed and downloadable apps for all major and popular streaming services, as well as many smaller media, information and entertainment apps, games and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s a web browser, app to play media from USB-connected storage, web browser, control hub for smart home gadgets, and much more. You also get the same kind of image enhancement and upscaling as a regular TV. And for pure connectivity and content services, there&rsquo;s no shortage of important features. Except for receivers for terrestrial or cable TV.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Samsung Odyssey Oled G9 Tizen OS\" class=\"wp-image-2038095\" height=\"1103\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/P_20230821_144936.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Using the Tizen OS interface as a media streaming center gets a little silly at times. Unless you get lucky and find real widescreen content.  </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mattias Inghe</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything is controlled with a small remote that gives you volume control, trackpad, and hotkeys to some key apps like Netflix and Prime Video. You also get a channel changer that works with Samsung&rsquo;s own Samsung TV streaming service, which has several live streaming channels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the experience of this screen as a smart TV is a little strange. The interface only covers part of the screen, which I assume is 21:9 format, with large unutilized areas around it, and there are also large empty areas when streaming content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a price tag of just under $1,800, the Galaxy Odyssey OLED G9 is obviously a big investment, but given the picture quality, the excellent gaming capabilities, the smooth handling thanks to the Tizen system and remote control, and the smart screen feature in general as a bonus, it might be worth it. Two 1440p OLED 16:9 screens this good probably cost the same or more. With better speakers and a proper USB-C laptop dock, and it would be a total winner.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Samsung Odyssey Oled G9 baksida\" class=\"wp-image-2038091\" height=\"697\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/P_20230821_152707.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Stylish on the back.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mattias Inghe</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article was translated from Swedish to English and originally appeared on m3.se.</em></p>\n\nGaming, Monitors</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2040013/samsung-odyssey-oled-g9-review.html", "date_published": "2023-08-25T11:11:10.566646+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": "PC world", "album": "PC world", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "How to put Chrome\u2019s download notifications back at the bottom", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>In early August, Google changed the way Chrome displays download notifications. Instead of files being shown as big rectangular buttons in a bar at the bottom of the screen, the information is now much more discreetly tucked in the upper right-hand corner. A single, small icon shows both your progress and completion status, along with a dropdown list of recent downloads when clicked on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you&rsquo;re finding this update difficult to adjust to, you can reverse it.
