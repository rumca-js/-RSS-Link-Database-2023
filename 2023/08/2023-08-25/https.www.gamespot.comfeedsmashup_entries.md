## AMD Tackles The 1440p Market With New RX 7800 XT And RX 7700 XT GPUs

<p dir="ltr">AMD is taking aim at the 1440p market with two new GPUs that attempt to balance generation-on-generation performance improvements and affordability.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-8-25-new-amd-radeon-rx-7800-xt-and-radeon-rx-7700-xt-gr.html">RX 7800 XT and RX 7700 XT</a> will both launch on September 6, with a free copy of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starfield/">Starfield</a> to give you an easy way to properly test them. These two cards, priced at $500 and $450, respectively, are more squarely aimed at tackling Nvidia's limp attempt at a mid-range card this generation, with both the RTX 4060 Ti and RTX 4070 mostly failing to impress the wide range of PC consumers. The RX 7800 XT boasts some impressive numbers over the RTX 4070 according to AMD's in-house testing, in both traditionally rasterized performance and ray tracing (an area where AMD has lagged behind for two generations).</p><p dir="ltr">In games such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cyberpunk-2077/">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hogwarts-legacy/">Hogwarts Legacy</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor/">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a>, the RX 7800 XT outperformed the RTX 4070 at 1440p by 23%, 15%, and 5% respectively. It did, however, lose out heavily when ray-tracing was turned on, with Nvidia's card pulling ahead by 12% in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvels-spider-man-miles-morales/">Spider-Man: Miles Morales</a> and 18% in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doom-eternal/">Doom Eternal</a>. Still, some outliers in favor of AMD with single-digit performance advantages, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-4/">Resident Evil 4</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/far-cry-6/">Far Cry 6</a>, both with raytracing on, show that AMD has potentially made some ground up. And at a full $100 cheaper, the RX 7800 XT proposes some mighty value over the RTX 4070.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amd-tackles-the-1440p-market-with-new-rx-7800-xt-and-rx-7700-xt-gpus/1100-6517238/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Warhammer: Age of Sigmar - Realms of Ruin is throwing around plenty of Warhammer pedigree. It's the first RTS title in the Age of Sigmar setting and arguably the largest game to touch upon Games Workshop's re-imagined fantasy realms, and it's being co-written by Gav Thorpe of Black Library fame. I've played Realms of Ruin a few times now and, at first, I was struck by how similar the gameplay was to Warhammer: 40,000 Dawn of War. But as the game's development has progressed, more and more of what makes Realms of Ruin unique and interesting has bubbled up to the surface. Now that the third faction has been announced, and we've seen a little of the Nighthaunts in action, the unique strengths and weaknesses of each side is a little more clear. That's something also helped by a healthy dose of balancing since the previous Realms of Ruin beta.</p><p dir="ltr">The Stormcast Eternals play much more into their survivalist, tanky, tough staying power playstyle. Orruk Kruleboyz have more utility and strategy from their traps and beasts. The Nighthaunt seem to be relying on pure strength in numbers, and wraiths and ghostly beings surround your troops.</p><p dir="ltr">The Nighthaunts also bring a new flavor to the game's roster, and I must admit, as a Warhammer fan, I often find it hard when previewing games like these to appreciate the bigger picture of what I'm playing as I zoom the camera into each model as close as possible to inspect their details.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-realms-of-ruin-puts-a-new-spin-on-rts-single-player-modes-and-console-controls/1100-6517233/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">In a recent court ruling, an 18-year-old from Oxford was identified as a member of an international cyber-crime collective responsible for a series of hacks targeting major tech corporations, including Rockstar Games. According to a report by the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-66549159">BBC</a>, Arion Kurtaj, a prominent figure within the Lapsus$ group, was implicated in breaches that also affected Uber and Nvidia.</p><p dir="ltr">Kurtaj's involvement went so far as to include leaking excerpts of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> while out on bail at a Travelodge hotel using an Amazon Fire Stick he found. Psychiatrists deemed Kurtaj unfit to stand trial, resulting in his absence from the court proceedings as a witness. The court's focus was on determining his culpability rather than assessing criminal intent.</p><p dir="ltr">Another individual, a 17-year-old also on the autism spectrum, faced conviction for participating in Lapsus$ operations. However, due to legal restrictions related to their age, their identity remains undisclosed. Referred to as "digital bandits," the UK-based, purportedly Brazilian gang was primarily composed of teenagers who blended hacking tactics to infiltrate multinational companies such as Microsoft and Revolut. Throughout their hacking spree, the gang taunted their victims on Telegram in both English and Portuguese.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-hacker-was-a-teenager-on-bail-in-a-hotel-room-using-an-amazon-fire-stick/1100-6517235/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>AMD has announced the next-generation of FidelityFX Super Resolution, or FSR, with the GPU manufacturer adding its own version of frame generation to the suite of optimization tools.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://community.amd.com/t5/gaming/first-look-at-amd-fidelityfx-super-resolution-3/ba-p/626581">FSR 3</a> introduces a frame-generation technique similar to that found in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nvidias-dlss-3-5-tackles-ray-tracing-quality-and-is-available-to-all-rtx-cards/1100-6517113/">Nvidia's DLSS 3</a>, but without the requirement to own the latest AMD GPU (or even an AMD GPU at all). Unlike Nvidia's method, which uses motion vector data from individual frames and utilizes specific optical flow hardware on RTX 40-series cards, AMD leverages software to make up for the missing hardware. The process for injecting synthetic frames in between ones rendered by the game remains the same, but its effectiveness now more heavily relies on how well the underlying game is running.</p><p dir="ltr">Since FSR 3 will use software to perform the optical flow calculations, attempting to use frame generation on games already struggling to maintain a relatively high frame rate won't produce great results, introducing stutter and latency. AMD recommends that a game be running at around 60fps already before trying to apply frame generation on top of that, meaning that it's gear more towards boosting already good frame rates into much higher territory for high-refresh rate display and not a silver bullet for getting poorly running ones more smoothly. This is also the case with Nvidia's own frame generation technique, despite its use of dedicated hardware, so it shouldn't be too surprising.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amds-fsr-3-has-feature-previously-only-on-nvidias-priciest-gpus/1100-6517237/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

"Why my head look like it ain't connected to my body."

<p>The long-awaited launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starfield/">Starfield</a>--Bethesda's first new IP in over two decades--is almost here. But some players just can't wait anymore, including Dan Harris, the man who allegedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-copies-are-in-the-wild-and-gameplay-has-leaked-so-watch-out-for-spoilers/1100-6517053/">leaked the first 45 minutes of the game</a> earlier this week. 29-year-old Harris has now taken things even further, reportedly listing stolen copies of the game for sale online--but this time, it seems, he's facing consequences.</p><p>According to the official website for the Shelby County, Tennessee Sheriff's Office, Harris was arrested on August 24, just a few days after leaking the Starfield footage. First <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-leak-felony-constellation-edition-play-early-1850773855">reported by Kotaku</a>, the site confirms Harris is facing one felony charge for possession of stolen property worth $2,500-$10,000, a misdemeanor charge for possession of stolen property worth $1,000 or less, and one misdemeanor charge for possession of marijuana. It's worth noting that <a href="https://recentlybooked.com/TN/Shelby/DARIN-HARRIS~3187_23111016">the publicly available booking records</a> do not mention Starfield by name, but it's not a drastic leap to assume that's what the stolen property was.</p><p>One thing viewers of the leak immediately noticed what the fact that Harris seemingly did not know how to play the game, appearing to be entirely unfamiliar with standard RPG mechanics. He <a href="https://twitter.com/ashenslinky/status/1694124813231509817/">explained this via a follow-up video</a> in which he addressed Bethesda Game Studios director and executive producer Todd Howard, and even shared his thoughts on the quality of the game itself.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/man-who-leaked-first-45-minutes-of-starfield-booked-on-felony-charges/1100-6517232/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The video game movie Gran Turismo from director Neill Blomkamp is now in theaters, and it's expected to have a chance at becoming the No. 1 film in the US. The movie earned $1.4 million in Thursday previews and is projected to earn between $12 million-$15 million this weekend in the US, <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/08/box-office-gran-turismo-barbie-blue-beetle-1235528051/">according to Deadline</a>.</p><p>The Gran Turismo movie was originally set for release on August 11 before Sony shifted it to August 25 to help avoid a clash with Barbie and Oppenheimer, which have proven to be very successful weeks after release. Sony already released Gran Turismo in major markets around the country for the past couple weekends and allowed press to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/review-roundup-for-gran-turismo/1100-6516664/">post reviews to help generate buzz for the movie</a>. Generating word of mouth for the film was important because actors are not allowed to do promotion during the ongoing Hollywood strikes.</p><p>Barbie was the No. 1 movie at the box office every weekend since it released on July 21, but the film was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dcs-blue-beetle-starts-slow-at-box-office-but-still-knocks-barbie-off-top-spot/1100-6517063/">finally beaten by Blue Beetle this past weekend.</a> Gran Turismo is competing with the Liam Neeson movie Retribution, which also releases today, August 25.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gran-turismo-movie-could-be-no-1-this-weekend-at-the-us-box-office/1100-6517228/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo IV's</a> stun-lock loving monsters are being brought down a notch in the next patch for Blizzard's ARPG, which primarily makes changes to monster abilities and affixes that have frustrated players since the game's launch.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-gb/diablo4/23964909/diablo-iv-patch-notes">Patch 1.1.3</a>, scheduled to release on August 29, should make the game's various crowd-controlling effects, like Cold and stuns, more manageable. Cold-enchanted enemies that attack rapidly, for example, will no longer apply Cold on every hit, Goatmen will use Cold pillars less often, and Cold enchanted spiders will apply less chill. One of the game's most frustrating enemies, the Nangari Snake Eyes, are having the duration of their stun ability reduced from 1.5 seconds to 1.25 seconds. The stun ability used by Cannibal Gorgers will also be easier to dodge.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard said all the changes above are to make it so players overall spend less time being crowd-controlled and have more recovery time after being hit by crowd-control effects. Some of the game's most prominent content creators have long <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLBstfi3uF4&amp;t=45s">complained</a> about how it feels overly punishing to become stun-locked for long periods of time, which at higher world tiers is essentially a guaranteed death.

<p>Gamescom is in full swing but that doesn't mean Spot On is taking a break. The event provides an ideal opportunity to catch up with developers and talk to them about the nitty-gritty details of game development. Of particular note, Blizzard's appearance at Gamescom affords a chance to talk to the team about what it takes to make, maintain, update, and improve the experience of an online live-service game like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo IV</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In this episode of Spot On, Lucy and Tamoor sit down with Diablo's Rod Fergusson and Chris Wilson to discuss the process involved in fixing a live-service game. The conversation covers Diablo IV's mixed reception--a strong launch followed by a largely ill-received Season 1--in the wake of the announcement for the second post-launch expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-2-start-date-and-everything-we-know-about-season-of-blood/1100-6517149/">Season of Blood</a> (an apt name for a season of content themed around vampires). Lucy and Tamoor also talk on the show floor following the interview, offering their own thoughts on Diablo IV and their interpretation of Fergusson and Wilson's statements.</p><p dir="ltr">Spot On is a weekly news show airing Fridays in which GameSpot's managing editor Tamoor Hussain and senior producer Lucy James talk about the latest news in games. Given the highly dynamic and never-ending news cycle of the massive video game industry, there's always something to talk about but, unlike most other news shows, Spot On will dive deep into a single topic as opposed to recapping all the news.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-its-hard-to-fix-live-service-games-spot-on/1100-6517231/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>With <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-season-of-the-witch-guides-season-pass-gear-exotics/1100-6517124/">Season 22</a> introducing a number of new weapon and armor changes in Destiny 2--some big and some small--the new Trials of Osiris weekend is going to be an interesting exercise in trial and error as you attempt to earn that flawless run. As usual, you can check in to see <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-is-xur-today-august-25-29-destiny-2-exotic-items-and-xur-location-guide/1100-6517219/">where Xur is</a> and if his inventory can give you the edge in Destiny 2's high-level PvP event. Here's a look at where you'll play Trials of Osiris this weekend and what weapons you can earn.</p><ul><li>Map: Meltdown</li><li>Reputation Rank 4: Upgrade Module</li><li>Reputation Rank 7: Enhancement Prism</li><li>Reputation Rank 10: Cataphract GL3 -- Grenade launcher</li><li>Reputation Rank 13: Upgrade Module</li><li>Reputation Rank 16: Igneous Hammer -- Hand cannon</li><li>Flawless Reward: The Immortal (Adept)</li></ul><p>Trials Passage offerings have also been updated to provide a better experience, starting with Passage of Wealth. This will now grant +75 Trials reputation for every win and an additional bonus for your current major rank in Trials, up to +150 total. Passage of Mercy will now forgive two losses if you have not yet been Flawless for the week, and after going Flawless, it reverts back to a state where it forgives a single loss on each card after you reset it.</p><p>Trials goes live from Friday's daily reset at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET until the weekly reset at the same time the following Tuesday. Make sure to pay a visit to Saint-14 in the Tower to pick up a Trials card, which will dictate certain bonuses (such as whether you get bonus rewards at certain milestones or if a loss will be forgiven). Your ultimate goal in the Trials of Osiris is for you and the other two players in your fireteam to achieve a "Flawless" run, in which you win seven matches without losing any.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/trials-of-osiris-rewards-this-week-in-destiny-2-august-25-29/1100-6517224/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Why Forza Motorsport Doesn't Have A Number Attached To It

<p dir="ltr">Even though the upcoming Forza Motorsport is the eighth entry in the racing game franchise--13th if you count the Horizon series, too--the title won't have a number. That's a deliberate decision to help show what the game aims to be, according to Xbox boss Phil Spencer.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-phil-spencer-gamescom-interview-starfield-baldurs-gate-3-mid-gen-upgrades-and-more">IGN</a>, Spencer elaborated on exactly why Forza Motorsport is switching gears with its naming. He confirmed it's because the new game will be a "service platform," though added, "I hesitate a little bit because I think there's a lot of loadedness in what that means."</p><p dir="ltr">Spencer talked about how a number in the title can give off the perception that the team, Turn 10, needs to quickly move on to the next installment in the franchise. "And it's like, no, we want this to be a place that people feel like they can invest their time, they can invest their experience, and know that this is a place that we're going to be investing in Forza Motorsport for years to come," he said.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-forza-motorsport-doesnt-have-a-number-attached-to-it/1100-6517227/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Back in 2019, Xbox Game Studios boss Matt Booty said Microsoft wanted to release a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2019-xbox-aiming-to-launch-a-new-first-party-ti/1100-6467659/">new first-party game every three months</a>, something the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-will-launch-at-least-one-new-first-party-game-every-3-months/1100-6492607/">doubled down on in 2021</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-once-again-aiming-to-launch-a-first-party-game-every-three-months/1100-6515089/">then again earlier this year</a>. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer is now talking about this again, telling <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-phil-spencer-gamescom-interview-starfield-baldurs-gate-3-mid-gen-upgrades-and-more">IGN</a> that releasing four first-party games per year was previously considered an "aspiration" but now it's the actual plan.</p><p>In 2023, Microsoft will deliver more than four. First-party releases so far in 2023 have included Hi-Fi Rush, Minecraft Legends, and Redfall, though Spencer said he understands if people don't want to give Xbox credit for that game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-exec-on-redfall-it-was-a-miss-but-how-much-of-a-miss/1100-6515285/">given how it turned out</a>. Microsoft's first-party output in 2023 also includes Age of Empires 4, which was just released on console, as well as Starfield and Forza Motorsport coming up soon.</p><p>For 2024, Spencer said releasing at least four first-party games will "absolutely" happen. "We have talked about it as an aspiration, now we talk about it as our plan," Spencer said.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-now-claims-its-actually-serious-about-releasing-four-first-party-games-every-year/1100-6517226/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

This season's NPC locations will once again take you all across the map in search of friendly--well, <em>usually</em> friendly--new faces to meet and greet. Most of them even offer helpful items, like heals and weapons, or services, like becoming your bodyguard or giving you storm circle intel. If you want to meet every NPC this season, use our guide below which highlights every name, number, and location for every Chapter 4 Season 4 NPC.</p><h2>Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 4 NPCs and locations</h2><p>There are currently 16 NPCs on the island in Chapter 4 Season 4, one of which is even a new skin that have not yet been seen in the game or shop. Each of them offers their services or helpful items in exchange for gold bars. Below is both the in-game map showing all NPC locations, as well as a table listing what goods or services they provide.</p><figure style="width: 3840px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4184015-fortnite2023-08-2509-11-57.png"><img alt="Every NPC in Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 4." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4184015-fortnite2023-08-2509-11-57.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Every NPC in Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 4.</figcaption></figure><p>It's also worth pointing out a few other things. For one, Nolan Chance (NPC 1) does not appear on the map in this image. That's because he's precisely located in the same spot as Antonia (NPC 4). Both of them are in the big barn at Frenzy Fields. Also, this season adds new <strong>Character Rep</strong>, an in-game rating of how familiar you are with a character.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-npc-locations-in-chapter-4-season-4-all-characters-and-what-they-sell/1100-6517203/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Kinetic Games has revealed that it will be delaying the console release of Phasmophobia after a fire broke out in its office space.</p><p>"Due to a recent fire incident in our office building and unpredicted development issues, our ability to test and develop has been significantly impacted," the studio said in a tweet. "After careful consideration we have made the tough decision to delay the console release, initially set for August, while we get everything sorted. We are now aiming for a special launch during the week leading up to Halloween this October."</p><p>Kinetic Games explained that this gives the team extra time to fine tune the game and make sure everything runs smoothly. Fortunately, the team is safe and unharmed. On the studio's Discord channel, the team clarified that the fire actually broke in a wider office building and didn't touch their office specifically. It's just that the team cannot currently access development equipment and are working from home.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fire-at-game-developers-office-building-causes-game-delay/1100-6517218/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer believes Starfield will have a Skyrim-like long lifespan. Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-phil-spencer-gamescom-interview-starfield-baldurs-gate-3-mid-gen-upgrades-and-more">IGN</a>, Spencer said Starfield will "absolutely" be supported for a long time after launch. The hope, as Spencer sees it, is for people to still be playing Starfield in the year 2033.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Spencer said he would not disclose what Bethesda Game Studios is thinking about in terms of ongoing support. However, he said he hopes Starfield can have the kind of "legs" that Skyrim had--and continues to have--thanks in part to the modding community.</p><p>"Our hope is that it is another game that's around a decade plus longer, later after it launches, and people are still enjoying it," Spencer said.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-can-have-a-skyrim-like-10-year-lifespan-phil-spencer-says/1100-6517221/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Armored Core 6: Ice Worm Boss Fight Guide

<p>Most boss fights in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/armored-core-vi-fires-of-rubicon/">Armored Core 6</a> have a few small tricks to beating them, but offer the flexibility to use whatever AC build you want. There are some exceptions though, including the Ice Worm boss fight, which comes during the <strong>Destroy the Ice Worm</strong> mission in Chapter 3. This is the final mission of this chapter and if you don't come into this fight with the right weapons setup, you will fail the mission. Here's everything you need to know about beating the Ice Worm boss fight in Armored Core 6.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to beat the Ice Worm</h2><figure style="width: 1280px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4182482-iceworm.jpeg"><img alt="The Ice Worm only takes damage when hit in the face." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4182482-iceworm.jpeg" /></a><figcaption>The Ice Worm only takes damage when hit in the face.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">For this fight, you will need to have the shoulder weapon <strong>VE-60SNA Stun Needle Launcher</strong>, which is automatically unlocked by completing the prior mission. This weapon is necessary for stunning the Ice Worm, so you have to have it equipped. For the rest of your weapon slots, you will want to focus on high damage weapons, like grenade launchers or missile launchers. The reason for this is there is basically a damage check that you have to pass, otherwise you automatically fail the mission. Don't worry though, you won't need to fight any smaller enemies during this mission, as you will have some companions that will take care of that.</p><p dir="ltr">The mission structure is simple, you need to take down the Ice Worm's shield by shooting it in the face with the Stun Needle Launcher. The worm moves a ton and you need to hit in the face--the game tells you the head, but it needs to be the face straight on. Just wait for the Ice Worm to stop moving and shoot. <strong>The Stun Needle takes a few moments to fire after activating it, so you need to lead the shot slightly.</strong></p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/armored-core-6-ice-worm-boss-fight-guide/1100-6517153/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Microsoft introduced its own dedicated showcase this year with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-officially-announces-xbox-and-bethesda-developer-direct-for-january-25/1100-6510475/">Xbox Developer Direct</a>, and so far, we've had the debut show, a Starfield Direct, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-and-starfield-direct-the-biggest-announcements/2900-4772/">and a big Xbox Showcase this year</a>. In the future, you can expect even more of these livestreams as Microsoft prepares to talk about its upcoming games more regularly.</p><p>"What I can say is we're going to have more beats to talk about more of what we do because the content lineup is so strong," Xbox head Phil Spencer said to <a href="https://za.ign.com/starfield/181165/news/the-big-phil-spencer-gamescom-interview-starfield-baldurs-gate-3-mid-gen-upgrades-and-more">IGN</a>. "And I say that completely recognizing that 2022 wasn't so strong, but we have our biggest booth here at Gamescom and we have a huge presence. So I think what you're going to see from us, where maybe last couple of years we've been more on an annual [cycle] in terms of when we talk about our games around, I still call it E3, around the E3 timeframe, this year, we did Developer Direct in January, we did our showcase, we're here and the biggest we've ever been at Gamescom, and you're going to see more regular times to talk about our games because the portfolio is deep enough that we can support that."</p><p>It has been a busy Gamescom week for Xbox, as Age of Empires IV made its debut on Xbox consoles, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/impressive-live-action-starfield-trailer-invites-you-to-the-cosmos/1100-6517077/">new live-action trailer for Starfield</a> kicked off <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamescom-opening-night-live-the-biggest-games-and-announcements/2900-4279/">Opening Night Live</a>, and gameplay for Ara: History Untold was revealed during the show.

<p dir="ltr">Start increasing your patience attribute because Dragon Age: Dreadwolf is probably a year away, at least. A new report states the BioWare RPG is targeting a Summer 2024 launch, but it could slip into 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">On <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_OmY0lUc0">Game Mess Mornings</a>--part of GameSpot sister site's Giant Bomb--Jeff Grubb talked about how Dragon Age: Dreadwolf's target date has shifted over time. "For a while there, it was like Dragon Age could have come out this year," he said. "In fact, internally, at one point, the date that they were looking at was next month--September 2023."</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">This might be why <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-might-not-release-in-2023-report/1100-6511173/">there were rumblings about a 2023 launch for Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</a> earlier this year. Obviously, that's not the case, especially since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioware-announces-big-job-cuts-and-reportedly-parts-ways-with-unionized-dragon-age-testers/1100-6517145/">BioWare just announced big cuts to its development team</a>, alongside parting ways with unionized playtesting company Keywords. As such, currently Grubb stated that Dragon Age: Dreadwolf isn't "coming out until Summer 2024 at the earliest at this point."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-may-not-launch-until-2025-report/1100-6517216/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 4 Battle Pass Rewards - All Skins, Emotes, And More

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4183343-c4s4keyart_en.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 4 brings a heist-focused makeover to the game, continuing on from a shorter story that took place in-game back in Chapter 4 Season 1. We didn't know it at the time, but that saga was setting the stage for the latest season, and that stretches across the entire Chapter 4 Season 4 battle pass.</p><p>In fact, other than this season's crossover skin with Star Wars, it seems the battle pass lineup of seven other characters all stem directly from the heist story that pits a ragtag group of professional pilferers against--wait, am I understanding this correctly?--a vampire???</p><p>Well, it's Fortnite, so I guess that's not <em>so</em> strange. This season's pass begins with an unlock of the heist team leader, Nolan Chance and players can work all the way up to the vampire villain at the end, Kado Thorne.</p><p>In between, they'll unlock TikTok star Khaby Lame, the first Icon Series character to be included in a battle pass. Other Epic-made originals include pizza deliverer (and getaway driver) Piper Pace, the muscular Fish Thicc--who might rival Meowscles for strongest looper on the island--and a new anime skin, Mae, who is said to be the group's hacker. Antonia, who can add or remove a mysterious mask, is also in the pass and the heist crew, though her role is more mysterious.</p><p>Rounding out the battle pass lineup while giving us another Disney crossover is Ahsoka Tano, the title character from the latest Star Wars series on Disney+. Ahsoka won't be available right away, as she's this year's midseason skin, so players will need to wait a few weeks to claim her--and not to mention complete a series of challenges once the day arrives.</p><p>For a look at those skins, every emote, back bling, and so much more, here are all 100+ battle pass rewards for Chapter 4 Season 4.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img

<p>PDP's new line of gaming controllers and headsets come with an interesting twist, as these colorful peripherals have some eye-catching visuals wrapped around them and have tiny figurines mounted inside. Carrying the branding of REALMz, these controllers are focused on multiple big-name IPs from Sega, Nintendo, and Hasbro, and will be available for Xbox and Nintendo Switch consoles. You can preorder a few of the Sonic the Hedgehog-themed designs now:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CBNP2TFH?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Sonic Green Hill Zone (Switch)</a> -- $40</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CBNNXG7M?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Sonic Superstars: Tails Seaside Hill Zone (Switch)</a> -- $40</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CGCN984V?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Sonic Superstars: Sonic Speed (Xbox)</a> -- $50</li></ul><p>So how do they work? Each controller has a transparent shell, and inside you can spot a figurine of famous video game characters like Sonic the Hedgehog, Knuckles, and Tails. As an added touch, these controllers are available in wired and wireless (for Switch) configurations, have LED lighting effects, and decals based on scenes from the IPs that they represent. Pricing ranges from $40 to $60 for the controller and $40 for the headset.</p><p>Future collaborations will feature Optimus Prime and Pikmin. This line will also extend to headsets, that dresses up the audio gear in Sonic's red, white, and blue colors while positioning the Blue Blur inside of an earcup.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/check-out-these-wildly-cool-switch-and-xbox-controller-designs/1100-6517163/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## In Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, Your Battle-Brothers Are Your Best Weapons

<p>Saber Interactive's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-gameplay-storyline-and-everything-we-know/1100-6514175/">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> once again puts you inside of the Ultramarine power armor of Lieutenant Titus as he commands the deadliest soldiers in the Imperium of Man against galactic horrors. While the game does have a single-player mode--with AI teammates--it also has a three-player co-op campaign mode where players can band together to take on Tyranid swarms.</p><p>Speaking to GameSpot, Space Marine 2 creative director Oliver Hollis-Leick explained how Saber Interactive designed the co-op portion of the game to make players feel like they were part of a Space Marine brotherhood. "On a fundamental level, the co-op aspect is about quality of experience. The Space Marines are a brotherhood and playing as a team of three, you get that vibe straight away, you start to feel this protective element and you start to share in the glory," Hollis-Leick said.</p><p>"It's an experiential quality first and foremost, in terms of tactics and strategy. When you're fighting a swarm and the battlefield situation can change very rapidly, it's all about responsiveness and spotting where your ally needs assistance. You can tag an enemy so that you can all focus your fire on one specific target, you can highlight weapons and equipment that might be useful to your teammates, but it's mostly about finding a rhythm. You're working together to take down the most difficult enemies, and of course, the better you do, the more the AI director will start to challenge you. So it finds that sweet spot, you're always just riding the wave."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/in-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-your-battle-brothers-are-your-best-weapons/1100-6517217/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Though an excellent gamepad, the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller is often only available in one look: plain black. Nintendo has never released alternate colors. That said, there have been several special-edition models themed around popular games, including Splatoon 3.

<p>HBO's The Last of Us Season 2 is likely to see a delay to its production schedule due to the ongoing Hollywood strikes. Showrunner and writer Craig Mazin told <a href="https://ew.com/awards/the-last-of-us-season-2-mapped-out-craig-mazin/">Entertainment Weekly</a> that people working on Season 2 in a <a href="https://www.backstage.com/magazine/article/above-the-line-vs-below-the-line-crew-differences-74969/">"below-the-line"</a> capacity are still plugging ahead, but actual filming cannot begin until the writer and actor strikes are resolved.</p><p>"To the extent that we can keep anybody below the line working, that's fantastic," he said. "I think it's becoming essentially a near certainty that we won't be able to start [filming] when we were hoping to start, which is upsetting. We are all raring to go. This is what we are born to do. This is how we not only choose to live our lives, but I believe [how we] are compelled to live our lives. Otherwise, why the hell would we do this insane job? I can assure you it's not for money."</p><div>          </div><p>Before the onset of the strikes, HBO management said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-was-planned-for-2025-prior-to-writers-strike/1100-6514648/">The Last of Us Season 2 would arrive in 2025</a>.

<p>Following a few "hotfixes," Larian Studios has released the first major patch for Baldur's Gate 3, and it's a big one. The update addresses more than 1,000 bugs, balance issues, and more.</p><p>In terms of bug fixes, NPCs should no longer be able to spot you when they shouldn't be able to, items that weirdly floated through the air should no longer do that, and Shadowheart's entire romance scene should play out appropriately now. Some visual bugs are addressed in the patch, too, and the kissing mechanics are improved for shorter people. "We're bringing back Short King Summer," Larian said.</p><p>Looking ahead, a second patch for Baldur's Gate 3 is "right around the corner," Larian said. This one will deliver "significant performance improvements," but Larian is saving specifics for later.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/major-baldurs-gate-3-patch-out-now-with-1000-fixes/1100-6517215/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Combat Turns You Into A Tactical Powerhouse On The Battlefield

<p>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine arrived at an interesting time in the gaming timeline, as Gears of War and other cover-based shooters still cast a long shadow over the action game genre. Relic Entertainment's Space Marine game was a major divergence from those games, an anti-cover-based shooter where players would dive into a mob of Orks and carve their way to victory with a high-powered chainsaw-sword.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-gameplay-storyline-and-everything-we-know/1100-6514175/">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>, developer Saber Interactive is aiming to retain that signature combat while building on it to make players feel like a seven-foot-tall engine of destruction. Speaking to GameSpot, Space Marine 2 creative director Oliver Hollis-Leick explained how Saber Interactive wanted to combine violent warfare with quick-thinking tactics on the battlefield.</p><p>"We wanted to create a combat mechanic to sustain a player through the whole of a campaign, and so we wanted to be more nuanced," Hollis-Leick said. "The Tyranids are a more tricky adversary, and especially with the Swarm mechanics which you didn't have in the first game, we needed a system that would allow you to move through large numbers of enemies in a sort of strategic way that would characterize the unique combat style of a Space Marine."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-combat-turns-you-into-a-tactical-powerhouse-on-the-battlefield/1100-6517214/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Is A More Cold And Brutal Game For Modern Audiences

<p>It has been more than a decade since Captain Titus faced hordes of bloodthirsty Orks in Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine, but at long last, the Ultramarine commander is ready to return to the battlefield and face down the enemies that threaten the Imperium. A lot has changed in the 12 years since the first Space Marine game, not only in terms of trends and hardware but also in the power structure of the gaming industry.</p><p>The first Space Marine game was published by the now-defunct THQ--which <em>kind of </em>lives on as THQ Nordic under Embracer Group--and this time Saber Interactive is taking over from Relic Entertainment to continue the story of Titus. With the original game being a beloved classic of the action genre, Saber Interactive had some big power-boots to fill, but as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-gameplay-storyline-and-everything-we-know/1100-6514175/">Space Marine 2</a> creative director Oliver Hollis-Leick explained to GameSpot in an interview, the studio wanted to put its own stamp on this sequel while preserving what made the original game so special.</p><p>"To be gifted with the opportunity to tell a new story in that world is an incredible privilege, but it comes with an enormous amount of responsibility," Hollis-Leick explained. "Everybody on the team is a massive Warhammer 40,000 fan. And that is not something I just say for PR, that is before we even did this game. There's a library at the office, they have tabletop games, and they have loads of books. We know the responsibility and we're taking it very, very seriously. And then what comes in between that because you can't just try and service people out of fear. There has to be an element of passion in there as well."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-is-a-more-cold-and-brutal-game-for-modern-audiences/1100-6517212/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/everything-new-in-fortnite-chapter-4-season-4-star-wars-skin-vampire-boss-and-more/1100-6517188/">Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 4</a> map features three new POIs, and unlike recent seasons which concentrated major changes to one area, this time they're sprawled across the island. These new areas are, in the story, belonging to the vampiric villain, Kado Thorne, who will no doubt play into this year's Halloween event in October. Here's what you need to know about <strong>map changes</strong> in Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 4.</p><h2>Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 4 new POIs</h2><p>This season features <strong>three new places of interest</strong> (POIs) to kick off the season. In every case, <strong>Sanguine Suites</strong>, <strong>Relentless Retreat</strong>, and <strong>Eclipsed Estate</strong> are heavily guarded with laser grids, cameras, and armed guards. That's why it's in these places where you'll find <strong>Mythic weapons</strong>, making each of them a sought-after but hard-fought addition to your inventory. Check out a gallery of new map landmarks and POIs below.</p><p>Eclipsed Estate has curiously taken over the Citadel, meaning one villain has replaced a previous season's home. What could that mean for the story? Sanguine Suites takes over the area that was once Lonely Labs, giving the formerly frosty region a new beachy theme. Lastly, Relentless Retreat gives the southwestern corner a major overhaul--the first this season--which should result in heatmaps revealing more player activity than recent seasons.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-map-changes-in-chapter-4-season-4/1100-6517202/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
