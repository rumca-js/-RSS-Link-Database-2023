The game offers plenty of bespoke ways to play thanks to a strong emphasis on customization.\n\nArmored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon is an incredibly complex game, not only in its minute-to-minute combat, but also in just how in-depth some of the customization options the game offers. While just about every aspect of the game is explained quite well in the title's introductory missions, as well as the plethora of tutorial missions unlocked during the game's early acts, some players might find it tougher to truly understand what's happening.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVfpNFspv_I", "date_published": "2023-08-25T23:08:34.930104+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/CVfpNFspv_I/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Immortals of Aveum Review - The Final Verdict", "description": "With a unique premise and a focus on magic over guns, Immortals of Aveum certainly stands out. Its narrative focus, loot and platforming to Talents and exploration - certainly feel distinct.\n\nHowever, even with solid art direction and a combat system that has potential, Ascendant Studios' first-person shooter ultimately falls flat. Its dialogue, fit for the worst Marvel movies, undercuts the narrative and setting. The combat falters due to a lack of options and visibility issues. The presentation, at least on Xbox Series X/S, has problems with distant details and image quality.\n\nImmortals of Aveum had some potential. There are some redeeming qualities, but as a whole, it fights you at every turn.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDbCooPYdGY", "date_published": "2023-08-25T23:08:34.928229+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/fDbCooPYdGY/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "10 BIGGEST Announcements At Gamescom 2023", "description": "Gamescom 2023 is currently in full swing but the biggest announcements from the event have already happened.
