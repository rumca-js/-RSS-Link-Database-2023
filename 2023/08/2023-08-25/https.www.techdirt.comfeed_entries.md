Back in 2015 domain registrar Tucows announced it would hope to modestly kickstart stagnant broadband competition by&#160;buying a small Virginia ISP&#160;by the name of Blue Ridge InternetWorks (BRI). Operating under the Ting brand name, the company said the goal was to bring a “shockingly human experience and fair, honest pricing” to a broken broadband market [&#8230;]

As you’ll recall, Montana passed a law earlier this year to ban TikTok (and ban mobile app stores from offering TikTok for download). The bill has lots of problems, not the least of which was that Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen flat out told the NY Times that the purpose of the bill was to [&#8230;]

In 2014, the Supreme Court made it clear: phone searches require warrants. While it did note the case involved a search &#8220;incident to an arrest,&#8221; the precedent was undeniable. If a phone search attached to an arrest requires a warrant, it would logically follow that any phone search by law enforcement &#8212; even those not [&#8230;]

There is no space for nuanced discussion about reality any more, as it seems that nonsense floods the zone. So, please try to follow along here as there needs to be some nuance to finally get down to the details of this issue. It&#8217;s nonsense, piled on top of nonsense, piled on top of nonsense, [&#8230;]

We&#8217;ve noted repeatedly how the hyperventilation about TikTok privacy is largely just a distraction from the U.S.&#8217; ongoing failure to pass even a basic privacy law or meaningfully regulate data brokers. We haven&#8217;t done those things for two reasons. One, the dysfunctional status quo (where companies mindlessly over-collect data and fail to secure it, resulting [&#8230;]

Earlier this summer, we talked about Trader Joe&#8217;s joining the list of large companies combatting unionization efforts through the most petty of methods: complaining about those unions over &#8220;trademark infringement.&#8221; Trader Joe&#8217;s isn&#8217;t the first company to go down this route of course, as we&#8217;ve seen Walmart and Medieval Times have behaved similarly. Nor will [&#8230;]
