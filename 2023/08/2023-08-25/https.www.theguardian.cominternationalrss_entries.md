<p>The men’s 2002 tournament sent the Asian nation into a football frenzy but the buzz quickly faded and there’s little to show for it now</p><p>The co-hosts swept to the semi-finals of the World Cup, creating then riding a wave of national fervour only to be beaten by a more clinical, ruthless and efficient European opponent. Quickly overriding the initial disappointment was pride at what had been achieved and optimism over the start of a new era. Politicians wore scarves inside stadiums and out, newspapers were wall-to-wall with football coverage and broadcasters who had been lukewarm in the past couldn’t get enough. The future looked dazzling.</p><p>Sound familiar? But this is not just the current Australian experience – South Korea found itself in a similar situation when it hosted the Men’s World Cup in 2002. But as Australia basks in the magical afterglow of the Matildas’ run, South Korea can serve as a cautionary tale.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/26/womens-world-cup-2023-support-for-football-australia">Continue reading...</a>

## Football Daily | Like all great mythical figures, even Mike Dean had an Achilles heel

Sign up now!</a></p><p>Mike Dean is one of modern football’s more intriguing figures. In his 22-year career as a Premier League referee, Dean embodied an elite brand of fastidiousness, dishing out 114 red cards, more than 3,000 yellows and an untold number of finger-wags, eye-rolls and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@premierleague/video/6981372383286414597?lang=en">off-you-pops</a>. Dean is the walking rule book who Garth Crooks once likened to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/av/football/34302203">“a petulant school teacher”</a>. On the other hand, he may have been a stickler on the field, but he was also a showman. There were the stepovers. The celebrations after setting up a goal with a smart advantage. The flourish with which he displayed a second yellow and mandatory back-pocket red. “I love what I do, there’s a touch of arrogance and I know that,” he once said. How can a man who looks, sounds, <em>lives</em> like someone disputing a late return fee at the library also possess such panache? And that’s without mentioning the pool parties, terrace chanting at Tranmere and fondness for ballroom dancing. Truly, Dean is a man of multitudes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/25/football-daily-email-mike-dean">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘I’d never experienced an orgasm’: Yewande Biala on her journey into female pleasure

<p>The former Love Island star may be a scientist, but until she was 20, she didn’t know women could climax. For her new documentary, she talks God, masturbation and the orgasm gap</p><p>Before she was a reality TV star, writer and now documentary maker, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/22/love-island-diversity-problem-why-are-yewande-fans-on-high-alert-for-heartbreak">Yewande Biala</a> was a biotechnologist, studying and working with, she says, orgasms. “Not orgasms! Oh my god,” she says. “<em>Organisms</em>. When I started this documentary, instead of ‘orgasms’, I would say ‘organisms’ – and now I’m doing it backwards.”</p><p>Initially Biala, 28, didn’t want to make the Channel 4 film Secrets of the Female Orgasm. She had become a fan favourite of the 2019 series of the ITV reality show <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/love-island">Love Island</a>, and was on a podcast a few years ago when the subject of sex came up; Biala revealed she’d never had an orgasm. A TV production company asked if she’d be interested in making a film about female pleasure. It took some convincing, but she did it to change attitudes. “I hope other women who have never experienced orgasm will understand that there is no shame in it. I hope if anyone [in education] watches, they will understand that maybe we need to improve the curriculum about sex.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/aug/25/yewande-biala-secrets-of-the-female-orgasm-love-island">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This year’s US Open marks 20 years since an American man last won a grand slam title: a once-unthinkable drought for one of the sport’s historic powerhouses. Where did it all go wrong?</p><p>It started out as a trickle.</p><p>In 1993, the relatively unheralded Sergi Bruguera won the first of his two consecutive French Open titles, becoming the first Spaniard to claim a men’s major since Manuel Orantes’ triumph at the US Open in 1975 (Arantxa Sánchez Vicario had won the women’s title in Paris in 1989). Then a few years later, in 1998, Bruguera’s countryman, Carlos Moya, claimed the French Open. He was followed by two more Spaniards, with Juan Carlos Ferrero’s triumph in Paris in 2003 and Albert Costa’s victory there a year later. For a country that had a rather modest pedigree, Spain was becoming a presence in men’s tennis.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/25/american-mens-tennis-grand-slam-title-drought">Continue reading...</a>
