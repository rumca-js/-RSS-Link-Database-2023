[{"source": "https://www.jefftk.com/news.rss", "title": "Lemonade Stand Costs?", "description": "<p><span>\n\nMy kids were thinking of having a lemonade stand, and in the past I've\nsaid that if they're doing it as a fundraiser we'll cover the cost of\ningredients, but if they're doing it for their own money then they\nneed to reimburse us. But how much should that be?\n\n</span>\n\n<p>\n\nThe recipe they're using is approximately:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>2C lemon juice\n</li>\n<li>2C sugar\n</li>\n<li>Water\n</li>\n<li>Ice\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nPlus cups to serve it in.  Makes about one gallon, or sixteen 8oz\nservings.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe water is <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/rough-utility-costs\">basically free</a> and\nthe ice is below the rate that our icemaker replenishes: also\neffectively free.  At our local grocery store 32oz of lemon juice is\n$3.50, sugar is $0.85/lb, and cups are ~$0.10/each.  So each 8oz\nserving of juice is:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>1oz lemon juice: $0.11.\n</li>\n<li>1oz sugar: $0.05.\n</li>\n<li>cup: $0.10\n</li>\n<li>total: $0.26\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nIf they sell until they run out of lemonade, call it a quarter a cup.\nThey usually sell each up for a dollar, so that's a gross margin of\n75%.  Not bad!\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid04uvrb1rmDFQ55KeTLzoKUxMNBqDrwQmmBrYe6LtRAZmveyw6G5cY6cnv2uMrgckfl\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://lesswrong.com/posts/zAeEZ2WCwSkmC62zw\">lesswrong</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/110952116000566960\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/lemonade-stand-costs", "date_published": "2023-08-25T20:49:05.717891+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Jeff Kaufmann", "album": "Jeff Kaufmann", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}]
