  <p id="mZDQEe">Google is experimenting with a text-to-speech feature for Chrome’s reading mode on desktop, <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-chrome-canary-read-aloud/">as reported by <em>Android Police</em></a>. I sometimes use a similar feature in Instapaper, and in Chrome, I could see it being a useful tool to listen to articles in the browser I’m already using while I work.</p>
<p id="0nZ8HB">The feature can apparently be found in Chrome Canary, Google’s bleeding edge version of Chrome, <a href="https://twitter.com/Leopeva64/status/1694962069504725027">according to X user Leopeva64</a>. If you have the feature, you can click a play button at the top of an article you’re looking at in reading mode to have Google read the text. Leopeva64 also shared a link to a video showing off the feature <a href="https://www.reddit.com/link/160q306/video/iihqsgt197kb1/player?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=u_Leopeva64-2&amp;utm_content=t3_160q306">on Reddit</a>.</p>

  <p id="LhSJsQ">The European Union’s Digital Services Act (DSA) has officially gone into effect. Starting on August 25th, 2023, tech giants like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and more must comply with sweeping legislation that holds online platforms legally accountable for the content posted to them.</p>
<p id="o5Ez6o">Even though this new law was passed in the EU, we’ll likely see far-reaching global effects as companies adjust their policies to comply. Here’s what exactly the DSA does and how the EU plans on enforcing it.</p>
<h2 id="ZD5DaG">What is the Digital Services Act?</h2>
<p id="evDiFH">The overarching goal of the DSA is to foster safer online environments. Under the new rules, online platforms must implement ways to prevent and remove posts containing illegal goods, services, or content while...</p>

  <p id="5aXfXB">Good news for Android-toting Google Keep users: you’re finally getting the text formatting options the app has so desperately needed for years. Google announced this week that the ability to bold, italicize, and otherwise transform text in your notes is rolling out now, and you should start to see it in the app soon. (I don’t have it yet, but <a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1692382230729875634">Mishaal Rahman</a> and a few others actually <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-keep-rolls-out-text-formatting/">spotted the feature</a> ahead of its official launch, so it seems to be coming fast.) </p>
<p id="IvSdjZ">The new Keep features are more in the “should have been here all along” category than they are shiny new things, but they’re still a welcome addition to the app. And actually, Google has been paying an unusual amount of attention to Keep recently: users got <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/27/23614281/google-keep-single-note-widget-checklist-interactive">a new homescreen...</a></p>

  <p id="WyzQw9"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>’s first official patch is apparently so large its patch notes exceed Steam’s character limit. The patch, out now, addresses “over 1,000 bugs, balancing, flow issues and much, much more.” You can read the full but spoiler-heavy patch notes <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/patch-1-now-live_87">here</a>, while <em>BG3</em>’s Steam page has a truncated but redacted version of the notes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/3669924544085723479">here</a>. </p>
<p id="YpdDpk">The most prominent fix in the patch deals with height issues that arise when short-statured characters like halflings and gnomes try to romance a taller race.</p>

  <p id="h2gaCB">Dropbox <a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/product/updates-to-our-storage-policy-on-dropbox-advanced">said in a blog post</a> that it’s implementing a metered model on its Advanced plan in response to customers who have been using Dropbox for cryptocurrency mining, “pooling storage for personal use cases,” and others reselling it.</p>
<p id="myVKb6">Because of that, Dropbox is getting rid of its “as much space as you need” offer. Customers who sign up for a Dropbox Advanced plan with three active licenses will instead receive 15TB of storage across their whole team. As for businesses currently on the plan, the company says those using less than 35TB of storage will get to keep that amount, “plus an additional 5TB credit of pooled storage, for five years at no additional charge to their existing plan.”</p>
<p id="YindBP">Dropbox will throw in an additional 5TB of storage...</p>

Barnum production. As our ringmaster, we have SoftBank, the current majority owner of Arm. On the high wire, with no net, we have AI. Riding an elephant, we have mobile. And doing a contortion act, we have US-China relations. </p>
<p id="kAoaRz">It’s been a slow time for IPOs, and the tech industry’s major silver lining is the AI boom. The bull case for Arm, the Cambridge, England-based company that designs chips, relies on its ability to move into the AI market. After all, in its current iteration, AI relies on massive data centers, stocked with state-of-the-art chips. But its most recent corporate filing raises some other concerns — and the question in my mind is what matters most to these...</p>
