Its fast and fluid combat takes on an almost dance like feeling as you flow between wide sweeps of your staff or climbing up its length to deliver a heavy blow, all while mixed with bizzare spells that transform you into a fiery warrior, change your flesh to stone to stun an enemy, or summon monkey allies with tufts of your hair. \n\nDave and Chris discuss what makes Black Myth: Wukong stand out against other Soulsbornes, what inspiration the game has taken from the genre, as well as what it hopes to add to it.\n\n#blackmythwukong #gamescom #gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yB85Gp6idk", "date_published": "2023-08-25T20:28:29.772276+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GameSpot", "album": "GameSpot", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/7yB85Gp6idk/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Why It\u2019s Hard To Fix Live Service Games (feat.

Many players were unimpressed with the season\u2019s unexpected nerfs and its lacklustre endgame. While community sentiment improved with the announcement of the game\u2019s second season, Blizzard still has a ways to go to implement necessary changes. \n\nTam and Lucy talk to the Diablo team at gamescom 2023 and ask about how developers assess what changes need to be made, how tricky it is to do it, and the pros and cons of being transparent with the community.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twCEqAd0dq8", "date_published": "2023-08-25T19:28:26.995622+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GameSpot", "album": "GameSpot", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/twCEqAd0dq8/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 4 LAST RESORT Official Gameplay Trailer", "description": "The luxurious exteriors of Sanguine Suites, Relentless Retreat, and Eclipsed Estate are strongly-defended bases complete with cameras, laser grids, and guards.
