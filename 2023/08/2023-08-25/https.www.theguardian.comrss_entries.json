Oliver Anthony\u2019s howling country protest song has appeared seemingly from nowhere to top the charts in the US this week, and inspire almost as many comment pieces as YouTube streams in the process. Framed as a hymn for the downtrodden working man in the vein of Woody Guthrie, it also smuggles in some rightwing talking points about overweight welfare recipients and taxation, prompting criticism from the left and whoops of support from conservatives.</p><p>The success of Rich Men, the first song to top the Billboard Top 100 by an artist who has never charted before, is remarkable enough on its own. Even more striking is that it\u2019s the third ostensibly rightwing cultural US hit of the summer.

Place, tradition, rootedness: these weigh heavily, sometimes lethally on the smalltown boy or girl with illicit or unruly desires. (Think Lou Reed, singing about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/14/they-didnt-go-round-the-corner-for-beer-lou-reed-and-john-cales-songs-for-drella\" title=\"\">Andy Warhol\u2019s youth</a> in Pittsburgh: \u201cYou hate it \u2013 and you know you\u2019ll have to leave.\u201d) Even in a bustling metropolis, things can feel provisional \u2013 new identities shakily built along an archipelago of clubs, bars and cruising grounds. And yet, as the Irish writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2021/feb/01/historical-tour-of-queer-cambridge-lgbtq\" title=\"\">Diarmuid Hester</a> argues, it all must transpire somewhere. Nothing Ever Just Disappears is a study of seven queer lives (plus a coda on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/derek-jarman\" title=\"\">Derek Jarman</a> and Dungeness) that seem to have transformed abstract space into meaningful place. Hester adopts a group-biography form that\u2019s become familiar,, but writes about dissimilar and mostly unconnected figures, promising \u201ca new history of queer culture and identity over the past 125 years\u201d.</p><p>It begins in Cambridge, where Hester has studied and taught, and co-runs an LGBTQ+ performance night, <a href=\"https://cambsedition.co.uk/gigs-nightlife/one-year-of-club-urania/\" title=\"\">Club Urania</a>, which takes its name from late-Victorian artists, poets and intellectuals who campaigned for homosexual rights. That lineage haunts Hester\u2019s first case study.

In Cambridge, where Forster had dreamed of a sexual idyll he named the Greenwood, Hester visits the novelist\u2019s room at King\u2019s College and finds it is now a mundane space with a football table and Ikea sofa. It\u2019s a letdown but leaves questions in his mind: how much of writing or art-making depends on place, how much on leaving it behind?</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/25/nothing-ever-just-disappears-by-diarmuid-hester-review-room-with-a-view\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/25/nothing-ever-just-disappears-by-diarmuid-hester-review-room-with-a-view", "date_published": "2023-08-25T11:11:29.752193+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": "The Guardian", "album": "The Guardian", "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "\u2018It\u2019s like Borat with music!\u2019: Eurodance stars from Whigfield to Ultra Nat\u00e9 review Planet of the Bass", "description": "<p>The next Gangnam Style, or a subliminal message about war?

The poem tells the story of a father\u2019s grief for a lost daughter, so Hughes\u2019s Pearl<em> </em>feels like a rather brilliant refraction, because while her story focuses on a bereaved child, there is still a grieving father, Edward, now in the supporting cast, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/16/rashomon-akira-kurosawas-truly-daring-film-is-still-electrifying\">Rashomon retelling</a> that works to expand the landscape of loss the Pearl poet explored. And this is not the end of Hughes\u2019s delicate redesign \u2013 as her tale unravels, it becomes clear that the lost \u201cpearl\u201d is another person entirely, and the grief we are concerned with in the bulk of this narrative is a kind of secondary product of an earlier loss, a tale told at one remove. Which, Pearl leads one to think, might be a way to imagine all griefs \u2013 the result of earlier losses stretching back and back to the beginning of the world.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/25/pearl-by-sian-hughes-review-a-circling-story-of-memory-and-loss\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/25/pearl-by-sian-hughes-review-a-circling-story-of-memory-and-loss", "date_published": "2023-08-25T10:06:34.008774+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": "The Guardian", "album": "The Guardian", "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Rubiales expected to resign, Klopp vows to keep Salah, and more: football news \u2013 live", "description": "<ul><li>Transfer interactive: the latest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2023/jun/01/mens-transfer-window-summer-2023-premier-league-italy-spain-germany-france\">men\u2019s</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2023/jun/01/womens-transfer-window-summer-2023-all-deals-wsl-europe-top-five-leagues\">women\u2019s</a> moves</li><li><a href=\"mailto:david.tindall.casual@theguardian.com\">Email David</a> with any thoughts | Tweet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DaveTindallgolf\">@DaveTindallgolf</a></li></ul><p><strong>Some injury news involving Manchester United and Chelsea</strong>.

His albums feature some of Britain\u2019s top jazz musicians, but you wouldn\u2019t call it jazz. It\u2019s an odd mix of creaky chamber music, clunky post-punk, lo-fi Afrobeat, avant-garde folk music and English whimsy. The self-taught saxophonist plays his tenor sax out of the side of his mouth in a breathy murmur, all simple phrases and fluttering, low-volume flourishes. He sings in mantras, occasionally lapsing into quite funny Robert Wyatt-ish spoken-word excursions. He also surrounds himself with fine musicians who push his simple songs into more challenging territory.</p><p>Last year\u2019s album Gold was quite carefully plotted \u2013 each song was pre-written and recorded to a click-track with several different line ups; in post-production Fairbairn switched between those separate performances or layered them. This album features the more exploratory, improvised parts of those sessions. There is a heavy African influence: Guinean musician Falle Nioke brings his high-pitched, wordless vocals to several tracks, including the blissful opener, Sibonde, backed by Sarathy Korwar\u2019s polyrhythmic drumming. Some are quite spartan: To That Voice and Say sees Fairbairn squawking out morse code messages on the sax while Ruth Goller plays bass guitar harmonics, and drummer Tom Skinner sounds like a drum kit falling down an endless staircase. Greek Honey Stick is just a duet for Fairbairn and Skinner \u2013 a thrillingly lo-fi mix of no wave guitars and drums.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/25/alabaster-deplume-come-with-fierce-grace-review-sublime-minimalist-improvisation\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/25/alabaster-deplume-come-with-fierce-grace-review-sublime-minimalist-improvisation", "date_published": "2023-08-25T09:02:38.197966+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": "The Guardian", "album": "The Guardian", "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Bret Easton Ellis: \u2018I connected with Quentin Tarantino\u2019", "description": "<p>The US author on discovering Stephen King, being inspired by Joan Didion, and losing himself in film criticism</p><p><strong>My earliest reading memory</strong><br />The Poky Little Puppy by Janette Sebring Lowrey, illustrated by Gustaf Tenggren.

So whereas Ten Hag was able to find a near-perfect short-term solution with the addition of five-times Champions League winner Casemiro a year ago, the club are struggling to find the answers this time.

If one considers the characteristics of the grizzly, this is quite a remarkable thing to write.<strong> </strong>We are not closely related to bears (their closest living relative is a seal), and grizzlies make for terrible company. And yet Muir was not alone in feeling that bears are somehow kin: we (or at least we in the west) tell stories about friendly bears; we fall asleep beside toys formed in their image; some have even tried to <a href=\"https://www.traffic.org/news/malaysia-celebrity-fined-for-illegal-possession-of-sun-bear-cub/\" title=\"\">keep them as pets</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/feb/03/1\" title=\"\">live with them in the wild</a>.</p><p>This imagined kinship forms just one thread in Gloria Dickie\u2019s book Eight Bears. It\u2019s a family album of the remaining varieties of bear, but the book does more than its title suggests. Just like a good photography critic, Dickie is attuned to the person behind the camera: how we have framed bears over the centuries, enmeshing them in the stories that we tell about ourselves. As Dickie shows, bears are in deep trouble, and her book is a compelling attempt to see through their eyes: to explore what it means to be a bear in a warming world that is short on space.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/25/eight-bears-by-gloria-dickie-review-the-grizzly-truth\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/25/eight-bears-by-gloria-dickie-review-the-grizzly-truth", "date_published": "2023-08-25T06:53:30.172545+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": "The Guardian", "album": "The Guardian", "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Heart of Invictus to Takeshi\u2019s Castle: the seven best shows to stream this week", "description": "<p>The inspiring story of the genesis of the Invictus Games, and more contestants line up to get smacked about in the reboot of the winningly daft assault-course contest</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/aug/25/heart-of-invictus-to-takeshis-castle-the-seven-best-shows-to-stream-this-week\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/aug/25/heart-of-invictus-to-takeshis-castle-the-seven-best-shows-to-stream-this-week", "date_published": "2023-08-25T06:53:30.095282+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": "The Guardian", "album": "The Guardian", "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "You be the judge: should we apologise to our neighbour after our son scared her cat?", "description": "<p>Annie says Hamza should say sorry, even though the cat poos in their garden.
