When Joe Biden, the incompetent head of the government, left vacation to visit the island, the residents were not impressed.

It's me)</p><p>Fallout, like comments made by this resident who lost everything, including her pets, her medication, and all of her money that was in her house. She would like Joe Biden to take the whole $700 he is handing out and stick it up his nose.</p><p>\"I think Joe Biden should take his $700 and get back on the f*cking plane and go home. That's what I think. $700 compared to all the millions he's giving to Ukraine. That's why we don't understand. We're citizens and we cannot get money.

Though, regretfully, this woman needs to be fact-checked. America has not given Ukraine a gazillion dollars. America has only given Ukraine $113,000,000,000. That is a lot less than a gazillion. It breaks down to $2500 per PERSON in Ukraine.

This Maria Maria only reminds me of a West Side story.</p><p>Santana was performing in New Jersey where he wanted to speak out on the hot-button issue. He also announced he was standing in solidarity with Dave Chappelle. Chappelle is best known for being <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dave-chappelle-jk-rowling\" target=\"_blank\">Vice Transphobe In Charge</a> behind head honcho <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jk-rowling-haters-tweet\" target=\"_blank\">JK Rowling</a>. <br /></p><p>\u201cWhen God made you and me, before we came out of the womb, you know who you are and what you are.
