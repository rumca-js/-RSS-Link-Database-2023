One comment caught my attention: it was an attack by former New Jersey Governor <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWkJX8iA6ms\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Christie on Vivek Ramaswamy implying he was a ChatGPT clone</a>.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t true, of course, but would that necessarily be a bad thing?</p><p>The critique goes to the struggle education is having about whether the use of <a href=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/3683209/gpt-high-tech-parlor-trick-or-first-real-ai-for-everyday-use.html\">ChatGPT</a> is somehow cheating and it mirrors similar concerns that using that generative AI tools for work are also cheating. (This brought back a memory of being a kid on a farm, painting miles of fence surrounding the property but being told I couldn\u2019t use a spray paint rig because that made the work fun \u2014 and work shouldn\u2019t be fun. I disagreed with then and still do now.)</p><p class=\"jumpTag\"><a href=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/3705432/the-republican-debate-and-chatgpt-room-for-gen-ai-in-politics.html#jump\">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>", "link": "https://www.computerworld.com/article/3705432/the-republican-debate-and-chatgpt-room-for-gen-ai-in-politics.html#tk.rss_all", "date_published": "2023-08-25T18:38:29.755070+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": "ComputerWorld", "album": "ComputerWorld", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2023/02/shutterstock_1227346972-100937394-small.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.computerworld.com/index.rss", "title": "New law could turn UK into a hacker's playground", "description": "<article>\n\t<section class=\"page\">\n<p>It looks as if <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/87615/changes-to-uk-surveillance-regime-may-violate-international-law/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">people are at last waking up</a> to a second extraordinarily dangerous requirement buried within a UK government bill <a href=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/3703055/apple-proposed-uk-law-is-a-serious-direct-threat-to-security-privacy.html\">designed to promote the nation as a surveillance state</a>.
