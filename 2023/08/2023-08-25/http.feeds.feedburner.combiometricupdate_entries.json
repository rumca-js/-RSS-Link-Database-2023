Consumers want to trust the businesses they interact with. Likewise, businesses looking to provide a personalized product or service need to trust that their customers are telling their truth about their identity.\n\nEnter digital verification. From employee safety to security and access, digital verification scored high across the board among the nearly 300 respondents to Interac\u2019s survey. A 57 percent majority said they were looking to adopt digital verification tools, or saw value in understanding them. Of those who plan to adopt digital verification, nearly half said they planned to do so in the next year.\n\nOther noteworthy numbers in the report include the 77 percent of respondents who said digital verification improved safety for remote access, and the 80 percent who agreed it improves safety for employees.\n\nThe largest worry among business leaders was <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/study-shows-data-security-is-key-to-rebuilding-consumer-trust\">data privacy</a>, about which 47 percent of respondents had concerns. That number looks fixable, though, considering the second largest concern is lack of education about the benefits of digital verification. This suggests that unfamiliarity is still partly driving hesitation.\n\nThe report returns to trust on the question of partnerships and vendor relationships. \u201cNearly 70 percent of survey respondents who use digital verification either deliver digital verification under a vendor brand or have a vendor endorse it,\u201d it says. Customers trust businesses who engage a third party in the security process, especially if the vendor brand brings its own cache of consumer trust.\n\n\u201cDelivering digital verification methods under a trusted vendor brand may also reflect the fact that Canadians access many different online services from many different organizations, often in a single day,\u201d says the report. \u201cThe name recognition of a vendor brand can provide peace of mind and further strengthen the trust associated with the company delivering the digital verification service.\u201d\n\nIn terms of how to select the right partner, Interac suggests businesses look for \u201ca digital verification solution provider who leverages market-leading technology and partnerships, has a proven track record in operational excellence and constantly builds their capability to support future verification needs as they emerge.\u201d\n\nRegardless, the report is blunt on its assessment of those who cling to paper as more and more leaders adopt biometric and <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202004/idnow-reports-26-8-percent-spike-in-digital-verification-following-coronavirus-outbreak\">digital verification</a> tools.

Their results show significant fairness issues related to skin tone and age.\n\nAccuracy of detection for adults was 19.67 percent higher compared to children. The study also found that the systems were 7.52 percent better at detecting light-skin individuals than dark-skin ones in all image datasets.\n\nResults also showed that detection performance involving the dark-skin group decreased under low-brightness and -contrast situations compared to the light-skin group: The miss rate difference between the dark- and light-skin subjects jumped to 9.68 percent at night.\n\n\u201cFairness issues in autonomous driving systems, such as a higher accuracy in detecting pedestrians of white ethnicity compared to black ethnicity, can perpetuate discriminatory outcomes and unequal treatment based on race,\u201d the researchers write.\n\nThe situation is hardly surprising, given the problems with face detection for different demographics experienced by some users of <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202106/proctoring-industrys-big-moment-is-really-a-big-black-eye\">remote proctoring</a> software.\n\nThe study finds some positives with only a 1.1 percent difference in detection accuracy when it comes to gender.\n\nFairness is an emerging domain within software testing. In the study, researchers added manually labeled demographic information to the four large-scale datasets used in the study, resulting in 8,311 images with over 16,000 gender labels, 20,000 age labels and 3,500 skin-tone labels.\n\nSelf-driving companies such as Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet, are already responding to the new study.

Stakeholders including representatives of Idemia and the TSA convened for a panel to discuss the changes ahead.\n<h2>What is the future of biometrics in North American travel?</h2>\nDuring a webinar organized by Future Travel Experience, government officials and representatives from businesses including <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/idemia\">Idemia</a> discussed how the United States is making progress in bringing biometrics to airports. The U.S. has faced an additional hurdle in building these systems as there is no national ID, unlike countries in Europe and other parts of the world.\n\n\u201cIt's taken us a little while to get to a place where we can connect up all of those driver's license databases and do authentication against them,\u201d says Anne Marie Pellerin, founder and managing partner at advisory company <a href=\"https://lam-lha.com/\">Lam Lha</a>.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland started to introduce the Comprehensive Biometric Entry and Exit Plan (CBP) back in 2016 with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) rolling out pilots the following year. Today, U.S. airports have several projects incorporating biometrics, built by both government agencies and private sector partners such as airports and airlines, while CBP and TSA are collaborating to test the technologies according to NIST standards.\n\nThe progress that the U.S. has made in introducing biometrics in airports is largely thanks to the desire to introduce passenger vetting, says Matt Davies, executive director of admissibility and passenger programs at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Biometric exits are now located at 46 different airport locations. These have helped the agency identify overstays and impostors.\n\n\u201cWe're actually confirming the identity using [biometric facial comparison] technology, but always with the human touch,\u201d says Davies, noting that an officer makes the final decision on evaluating the passengers\u2019 documents.\n\nThe agency is working on a number of other programs including the Global Entry which is a trusted traveler program similar to mobile passport control that has exceeded over 12.3 million sign-ups, with over 3.1 million enrolled and renewed this year.\n\nOthers include mobile app programs which could reach 3.5 million users by the end of the year, says Davies. The Mobile Passport Control app designed for Canadian and U.S. citizens was launched in June and requires users to upload photos of themselves and their passports. Another is the <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/border-protection-in-us-debuts-biometric-app-using-facetec-liveness\">Electronic System for Travel Authorization</a> (ESTA) application.\n\n\u201cWhen we're using that as a matching service with the photos and the passport photos, the live selfie photos, we're seeing match rates of about 99.46 percent,\u201d says Davies. \u201cIt's more secure for us, but also puts some of that control and that power back in the hands of the traveler to know what they should expect.\u201d\n\nThe next step for the agency is seeing how they can align people and their bags, especially for international connecting passengers.\n\nMatt Gilkeson, director of the TSA Innovation Taskforce, says that the agency has been excited to work on mobile driver's licenses (mDLs) and digital IDs. The agency adopted the ISO/IEC standard for <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html\">digital IDs that maintain privacy</a>. Programs are already live in five states with over 25 airports across the country accepting mDLs.\n\n\u201cWe've also got private label digital IDs with American Airlines which also allows us to do that one-on-one matching,\u201d Gilkeson says.\n\nIdentity management will become a critical part of the security landscape, he adds. The current kind of state-of-the-art today is Credential Authentication Technology (CAT), which automates the verification of the ID, boarding pass information and secure flight matching.\n\nCurrently, the officer has to manually verify the match between the person and the credential, but with <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/rollout-of-biometric-cat2s-begins-in-colorado-as-legacy-scanners-reject-state-ids\">CAT2</a>, the agency is moving a step forward in automation by allowing biometric verification of the ID credential. Within the next 12 to 18 months, the TSA will work with identity verification company Idemia on a nationwide rollout of a stronger security solution with an aim to switch from one-to-one matching to one-to-end matching for those customers who opt-in.\n\nBut Gilkeson also notes that technology is not the problem: \u201cThe people are the challenge.\u201d\n\nIdemia\u2019s Lisa Sullivan agrees. The company\u2019s senior vice president for travel and transport notes that when people who are traveling are stressed, they are less compliant.\n\n\u201cWhen they're stressed, they also don't spend as much money because they're not happy,\u201d she says.\n\nThe introduction of new programs for travel is a great way to reduce stress and Idemia has been helping TSA in several of them, including the Pre-Check program which has so far enrolled 18 million passengers. The program allows passengers to get shorter lines by paying US$70 for five years. Idemia says that the next big thing in travel will be mobile identities.\n\n\u201cDigital identities are here,\u201d says Sullivan. With the advent of mobile IDs including TSA\u2019s acceptance of mobile IDs and mDLS, more users will start to adopt these solutions, she adds.\n\nAirline companies are also <a href=\"https://skift.com/2023/08/24/ryanair-delta-lufthansa-what-airline-execs-are-saying-about-ai-biometrics-and-apps/\">investing</a> in biometrics and digital IDs. Air Canada has expanded its biometric facial recognition pilot program boarding aircraft and entering lounges.\n\nDelta Air Lines has been working on new biometrics around digital ID to allow customers to go through TSA and board the aircraft without showing anything.\n<h2>Vietnam, India deploy more biometrics at airports</h2>\nOther countries across the world are <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202304/airports-in-4-countries-deploy-biometrics-digitize-to-streamline-operations\">pushing their own projects</a> to streamline flying with biometrics.\n\nThe latest news comes from Vietnam, where five airports have launched automatic entry systems called Autogate. In April, the country announced it had chosen <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/vision-box\">Vision-Box</a> for its border modernization project.\n\nThe arrival terminals will be accessible to all Vietnamese citizens holding chip-based passports.

While there have been many contributions to this discipline from a psychological and philosophical standpoint, the same cannot be said about technology. Attempting to identify human emotion using technology is a relatively new field and one that has been met with <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202202/3d-emotion-recognition-hardware-gets-better-but-the-software-might-still-be-iffy\">mixed results.</a>\n\nWithin the realm of these applications, however, biometric approaches have shown promise, particularly face biometrics. The combination of different physiological and behavioral data types, and use of multimodal biometrics have also helped the discipline <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202208/new-unsupervised-ai-method-performs-multimodal-emotion-recognition\">move forward.</a>\n\nBut how can biometric scanners and algorithms measure human emotion in practical terms?\n<h2>Face biometrics</h2>\nMost ER tools based on face biometrics work via readings of physiological responses and facial expressions. The latter are categorized into discrete emotions and typically include amusement, awe, enthusiasm, liking, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.\n\nAs described in a <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343443531_Facial_Emotion_Recognition_A_Brief_Review\">2018 study</a> by Universiti Putra Malaysia, facial emotion recognition (FER) processes are usually divided into three stages, face detection, feature extraction (nose, mouth, etc.), and emotion classification.\n\nFor a FER system to work, in the last stage of this process, a classifier needs to be trained in order to generate labels for individual emotions using the training data. Different facial coding systems have been developed to classify emotions based on the movements of specific facial muscles.\n<h2>Voice recognition</h2>\nER based on voice biometrics is still in its infancy. Still, as voice recognition algorithms become <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202210/id-rd-claims-first-place-in-global-voice-biometrics-competition-for-in-the-wild-samples\">increasingly more efficient</a>, researchers and companies alike are working to apply the technology to measuring sentiment.\n\nTechnically, speech ER (SER) can rely on three distinct characteristics of the human voice, namely lexical features (vocabulary), visual features (facial expressions) and acoustic features (sound properties).\n\nAccording to a <a href=\"https://www.analyticsinsight.net/speech-emotion-recognition-ser-through-machine-learning/\">2020 study</a> by Brillio, SER systems relying on lexical features require a transcript of the speech alongside text extraction capabilities to predict emotions from real-time audio. Those depending on visual elements, on the other hand, rely on the analysis of the video of the conversations, making it a form of multimodal biometric ER.\n\nBecause of these limitations, many SER rely on acoustic features, which can be analyzed in real-time. The Brillio studio mentioned here, in particular, tried to classify emotions based on two methods.\n\nThe first one, called discrete classification, is akin to what is mentioned above for FER, categorizing emotions in discrete labels like anger, happiness, boredom, etc. The second one, \u201cdimensional representation,\u201d aims to represent emotions with dimensions such as Valence (on a negative to positive scale), Activation or Energy (on a low to high ranking) and Dominance (on an active to passive scale).\n\nIt is helpful to mention here that with both face and <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202106/south-asian-group-develops-voice-based-emotion-recognition\">voice biometrics ER</a> tools (as well as standalone devices), wearables are often used to record physiological data, including cardiovascular information, to identify emotions more accurately.\n<h2>Gait recognition</h2>\nMethods of reading individuals' emotions from their gait biometrics are slowly improving, but the technology is still relatively far away from commercial applications.\n\nStill, there have been several attempts by researchers and governments to turn gait ER (GER) into a viable method of assessing a person's emotional status.\n\nAccording to a <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202211/scientists-say-theyve-improved-on-emotion-recognition-from-a-persons-gait\">non-peer-reviewed study</a> published by Chinese researchers in September 2022, for instance, it is possible to assess an individual's emotion based on the position of certain bones in their skeleton as they walk.\n\nThe algorithm used in this study, called multi-scale adaptive graph convolution network (MSA-GCN), is intended to extract general gait data and create fine-grained graphs to uncover local information.\n\nA similar technique (generally understood as the most widespread technique to perform GER at the time of writing) was presented in a <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35009944/\">separate paper</a> published in January 2022 by a joint team of Canadian and Taiwanese researchers.\n<h2>Legal implications</h2>\n<a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/video-surveillance\">Biometric surveillance</a> is generally among the most criticized methods of technocratic control by authoritarian regimes worldwide, and is often associated with emotion recognition. ER to many people evokes dystopian images of mind-controlled citizens, immediately punished for thinking or feeling something they should not.\n\nIn China, for instance, the government has deployed facial recognition tools to <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202209/biometric-data-collection-by-chinese-government-still-growing-along-with-breaches\">record students' moods</a> or ones allegedly capable of testing <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202207/china-develops-face-biometrics-ai-tool-to-test-party-member-loyalty\">loyalty to the Party.</a>\n\nBeyond the alleged and actual Orwellian schemes associated with ER deployments, these technologies are finding fertile ground <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202205/emotion-recognition-ai-finding-fans-among-lawyers-swaying-juries-and-potential-clients\">among lawyers in the U.S.,</a> who have been reportedly using them to assess the emotions of panels hired by attorneys before trials as stand-ins for juries.\n\nMeanwhile, UK politicians are treading carefully regarding emotion recognition technologies. The country's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202210/uk-regulator-warns-firms-off-ai-emotional-analysis\">issued a warning</a> against the deployment of these technologies in October 2022.", "link": "https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/what-is-emotion-recognition-and-how-can-biometrics-be-used-to-perform-it", "date_published": "2023-08-25T15:48:15.075805+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Biometric Update", "album": "Biometric Update", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}]
