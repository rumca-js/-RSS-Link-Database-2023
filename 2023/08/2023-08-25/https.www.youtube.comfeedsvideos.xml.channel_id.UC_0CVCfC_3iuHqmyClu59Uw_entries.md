This is the most powerful Linux gaming PC we have ever built and in this vidope we take a look a 4K gaming on the ChimeraOS Gaming PC. This thing is absolutely insane and offers the best Linux Gaming We’ve seen so far! Of course, you could always just install Windows or another Linux distro like Manjaro but I’m a big fan of Steam OS 3 and ChimeraOS offers everything I need in a Linux gaming Distro. 4K gaming on Linux using Proton has never been so good!
