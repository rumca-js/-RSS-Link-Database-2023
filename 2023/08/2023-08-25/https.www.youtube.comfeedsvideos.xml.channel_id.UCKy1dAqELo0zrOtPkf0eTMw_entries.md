In today's Daily Fix: a British court convicted a teenager associated with the hacking group Lapsus$ for his role in the massive leak of unreleased Grand Theft Auto 6 assets stolen from Rockstar. The hacker's youth didn't stop him from accessing the systems of other companies like Nvidia and Uber - he was even out on bail for one of those hacks when he was arrested for the GTA 6 leak! More on that, plus Mortal Kombat ko-kreator Ed Boon reassures IGN's audience that DLC fighters Homelander and Omni-Man, each a riff on the "evil Superman" archetype, will have totally different movesets in the upcoming Mortal Kombat 1.

Eternights will be available on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Steam, and the Epic Games Store on September 12, 2023. Check out the latest trailer to see gameplay, fierce enemies, and more from Eternights, the upcoming game that is a blend of dating and monster slaying.

In Eternights, the world we know is turned upside down when a mysterious event transforms people into violent monsters and creates giant walls that close in your city. When your arm is replaced with a magical, shapeshifting replica that grants you strange powers, it’s up to you to break through the wall and save the world… and your love life. Dates still happen during the apocalypse, and even when a surreal evil brings life as you know it crashing down, what matters most is the people around you.
