In his 22-year career as a Premier League referee, Dean embodied an elite brand of fastidiousness, dishing out 114 red cards, more than 3,000 yellows and an untold number of finger-wags, eye-rolls and <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@premierleague/video/6981372383286414597?lang=en\">off-you-pops</a>.

On the other hand, he may have been a stickler on the field, but he was also a showman. There were the stepovers. The celebrations after setting up a goal with a smart advantage. The flourish with which he displayed a second yellow and mandatory back-pocket red. \u201cI love what I do, there\u2019s a touch of arrogance and I know that,\u201d he once said. How can a man who looks, sounds, <em>lives</em> like someone disputing a late return fee at the library also possess such panache? And that\u2019s without mentioning the pool parties, terrace chanting at Tranmere and fondness for ballroom dancing.
