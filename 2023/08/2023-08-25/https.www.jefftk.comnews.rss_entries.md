My kids were thinking of having a lemonade stand, and in the past I've
said that if they're doing it as a fundraiser we'll cover the cost of
ingredients, but if they're doing it for their own money then they
need to reimburse us. But how much should that be?

</span>

<p>

The recipe they're using is approximately:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<ul>
<li>2C lemon juice
</li>
<li>2C sugar
</li>
<li>Water
</li>
<li>Ice
</li>
</ul>



<p>

Plus cups to serve it in.  Makes about one gallon, or sixteen 8oz
servings.

</p>

<p>

The water is <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/rough-utility-costs">basically free</a> and
the ice is below the rate that our icemaker replenishes: also
effectively free.  At our local grocery store 32oz of lemon juice is
$3.50, sugar is $0.85/lb, and cups are ~$0.10/each.  So each 8oz
serving of juice is:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<ul>
<li>1oz lemon juice: $0.11.
</li>
<li>1oz sugar: $0.05.
</li>
<li>cup: $0.10
</li>
<li>total: $0.26
</li>
</ul>



<p>

If they sell until they run out of lemonade, call it a quarter a cup.
They usually sell each up for a dollar, so that's a gross margin of
75%.  Not bad!
