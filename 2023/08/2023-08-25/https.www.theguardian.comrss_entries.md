<p>Edinburgh fringe comics portraying cancelled standups and rightwing politicians talk about the dangers and successes of their satire</p><p>The US comedian Martin Urbano has always enjoyed mocking lazy standup jokes – the sort of routines that open with “Anyone ever been to a …?” or a crude comedian’s gags about his imaginary wife. Immediately after the #MeToo movement, the “hacky premises” of such material shifted, he says. “There were a lot of guys like: ‘I’m scared to even sneeze around a woman. I’m scared to fart around a woman!’” Urbano started working up material in character as one of those guys.</p><p>He thought comedy would move on quickly, but that didn’t happen. Instead, “you can’t say anything any more” became a common refrain, while famous comedians such as Dave Chappelle and Ricky Gervais direct jokes at trans people in their comedy specials.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/25/edinburgh-fringe-comics-anti-woke-characters">Continue reading...</a>

The pilot of the title is the TV kind – one of those tentative beginnings designed to encapsulate the idea for a successful series but that sometimes lead nowhere. The show looks at how we package ourselves – the first impressions we make as well as the internalised beliefs that are insidiously sparked by others.</p><p>Lawal goes for an unassuming introduction and begins seated among the audience.

The bar was low after the first, a half-assed waste of actors who deserve better, but the sequel is somehow even worse, a maddeningly unfunny string of bad decisions, the worst of which was deciding to make it in the first place.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/25/vacation-friends-2-review-painfully-unfunny-comedy-sequel">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on the energy price cap: nothing to boast about | Editorial

<p>In spite of the overall fall in household bill levels, millions will not gain from cheaper gas and electricity this winter</p><p>“Energy prices to fall again this winter” was the upbeat headline on the press release published on Friday by the energy regulator, <a href="https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/publications/energy-prices-fall-again-winter" title="">Ofgem</a>. On the face of it, the fall in the energy price cap from October is indeed welcome news for every household in Britain. In the current quarter, the cap for a typical household energy bill is set at £2,074 a year; from October the figure will be £1,923. It is the third quarterly fall since the cap reached a peak of £4,279 in January this year and the lowest cap since the start of 2022.</p><p>Yet the Ofgem headline will also be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/aug/25/ofgem-energy-price-cap-falls-but-consumers-still-face-high-bills" title="">misleading</a> for millions. One reason is that, even from October, the cap will still be much higher than when it was first imposed, in response to political pressure, in 2019. Another is that, unlike when the peaks were reached last winter, the £400 per household universal rebate no longer applies; nor does the government’s October 2022 energy price guarantee, which disappeared at the start of July.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/25/the-guardian-view-on-the-energy-price-cap-nothing-to-boast-about">Continue reading...</a>

Most of the missing objects might not be of great value: nearly a thousand came from a bequest made by the family of an 18th-century collector, and had been stored away in a drawer without even being individually catalogued.</p><p>But the narrative is devastating. When the drawer was opened, it <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/08/23/museum-elgin-marbles-thefts-british-job-promoted-greece/" title="">has been reported</a>, only seven items remained.

By the time the <a href="https://www.britishmuseum.org/sites/default/files/2023-08/Announcement_regarding_missing_stolen_and_damaged_items.pdf" title="">thefts were made public</a> last week, a senior staff member had been sacked and the Metropolitan police called in.

One other factor has a major impact on living standards in poor countries – sanctions.</p><p>Fifty or more countries are under sanctions. One example is Afghanistan. The country is economically isolated. The stated purpose is to help the population suffering under Taliban rule, but sanctions have been enforced for over a year and show no signs of working. They do, however, exacerbate food insecurity in the population and make it impossible to begin rebuilding the country after decades of strife. Sanctions on Cuba for over 50 years have not worked. There is no good reason to believe they will work in Afghanistan.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/25/from-sanctions-to-aid-cuts-uk-foreign-policy-is-fuelling-rising-migration">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From the business model, to lack of resources, to mushrooming management, readers look at what the NHS must learn</p><p>Your correspondent, Dr Maybelle Wallis (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/21/nhss-culture-of-denial-allowed-lucy-letby-to-keep-killing-babies" title="">NHS’s culture of denial allowed Lucy Letby to keep killing babies, 21 AugustLetters, 21 August</a>), reflecting on the Lucy Letby case, correctly pinpointed Margaret Thatcher’s introduction of “general management” as a pivotal moment in the culture of the NHS. The idea was that senior managers from the private sector should be brought in to run local hospital provision, which would be increasingly based on local trusts competing in the “internal market”. My local health authority was headed by someone with no NHS experience who had previously run a biscuit factory.</p><p>The great pity is that, despite no mention of them in the 2001 election manifesto, New Labour’s introduction of foundation trusts from the following year sought to further institutionalise the fragmentation of the NHS into competing local units, following this “business” model. While some of the most detrimental elements of the initial proposals were fought off, the end result has still been an increasingly inward-looking, defensive management culture with an instinct towards concealment if reputational damage is a possibility.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/aug/25/the-lucy-letby-case-must-lead-to-changes-in-hospital-management">Continue reading...</a>

<p>At times it was utterly ridiculous, the characters’ behaviour was inexplicable and no one knows why Aidan needed <em>a five-year (!)</em> break. But it was one intensely watchable car crash …</p><p>And just like that, Samantha’s cameo – sorry, “special appearance” – was over. We knew it wouldn’t be a lengthy drop-in, given that Kim Cattrall allegedly cannot stand Sarah Jessica Parker, and had already disclosed that the two women filmed separately. Still, perhaps we expected it to be longer than a minute and a half.</p><p>Rather brilliantly, however, Cattrall’s cameo was essentially her explaining how she would not be cameoing. Samantha’s flight to New York was delayed by three hours – she was “fucking furious” – and so couldn’t, after all, surprise Carrie at the last supper she was holding in her old apartment. Maybe Samantha hadn’t even been to Heathrow. Maybe Samantha just told the driver to circle the block a few times. Maybe that plane took off right on time. Props to Kim for earning an absolute packet for sitting in a cab and wearing a look by the OG stylist <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/patricia-field-kim-cattrall-cameo-style-b2398968.html">Patricia Field</a>.

By the time he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/24/trump-surrender-georgia-jail-overturn-2020-election">surrendered at Fulton</a>, like that other fading star Gloria Swanson in Sunset Boulevard, Trump was ready for his close-up. The celebrity mugshot, after all, is more about performance art and political statement than mere police documentation.</p><p>Trump makes the best of what he has. Or his people do. Is it possible they brokered a deal with the sheriff to change the wattage of the overhead lightbulb to make it less harsh? Boldly leaning forward so we can study his thatch, and see where toupee ends and pate begins, it’s a performance that perhaps, like his hairpiece, is poised to become unstuck. The red-rimmed eyes suggest tiredness. Perhaps – let me dream – he’s been crying over his comeuppance.

<p><strong>Royal Albert Hall, London<br /></strong>The violinist gave a masterly performance of Elgar’s violin concerto, well matched by a responsive Sakari Oramo. Judith Weir’s nature-filled Begin Afresh, receiving its premiere, was evocative and full of ideas</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.judithweir.com/">Judith Weir</a>’s Begin Afresh, premiered by Sakari Oramo and the BBC Symphony Orchestra in their latest Prom, is a reflection on trees. Or rather, it is a musical expression of the forces within trees, and what they evoke as the cycle of the seasons change.</p><p>Though trees themselves are necessarily static, Weir’s three-movement score is anything but. It ripples sinuously in the spring, with almost a concertante role for lead violin Igor Yuzefovich, pulses mysteriously in the autumn, and is full of mostly quiet activity even in midwinter. Begin Afresh, a title drawn from <a href="https://poetryarchive.org/poem/trees/">Philip Larkin</a>, is delicately scored and its ideas are always evolving in a recognisably traditional way. It even gets a bit Tolkienesque at times, with piano and brass conjuring passages that sounded distinctly like music for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ent">ents</a>. Oramo and his players did it all proud.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/25/prom-51-bbcso-sakari-oramo-review-christian-tetzlaff-judith-weir-begin-again">Continue reading...</a>

Thus we discovered that advertising<strong> </strong>promotions for baby formula for use from birth up to six months is banned in the UK, owing to the belief they’ll discourage breastfeeding.</p><p>It was a shock, as modern women, to be subjected to such paternalistic laws around what we did with our bodies and how we fed our own offspring.

Oliver Anthony’s howling country protest song has appeared seemingly from nowhere to top the charts in the US this week, and inspire almost as many comment pieces as YouTube streams in the process. Framed as a hymn for the downtrodden working man in the vein of Woody Guthrie, it also smuggles in some rightwing talking points about overweight welfare recipients and taxation, prompting criticism from the left and whoops of support from conservatives.</p><p>The success of Rich Men, the first song to top the Billboard Top 100 by an artist who has never charted before, is remarkable enough on its own. Even more striking is that it’s the third ostensibly rightwing cultural US hit of the summer. Earlier this month, country star Jason Aldean also topped the Billboard charts with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/19/country-star-jason-aldean-try-that-in-a-small-town-song">Try That in a Small Town</a>, a paean to vigilanteism accompanied by a racially loaded (and since re-edited) music video.

The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/19/fulham-brentford-premier-league-match-report">game between Fulham and Brentford</a> is winding down to a finish, and with Brentford 2-0 up neither team seems in any great hurry to get on with things. The Brentford goalkeeper takes a couple of touches, waits for the picture to assemble in front of him. Twelve seconds later, the ball thuds into the back of the Fulham net.</p><p>The events that unfold in those 12 seconds offer the faintest outline of what, exactly, it is Brentford are doing out there. For this is a club of multiple apparent paradoxes. A team that lost their 20-goal striker and not only refused to replace him, but are now scoring more freely as a consequence. A team playing long-ball football with two forwards who are 5ft 7in and 5ft 9in. A team of limited means who in their third season of Premier League football are actually becoming more elusive, not less.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/25/counterattack-kings-how-brentford-kept-their-cool-after-losing-ivan-toney">Continue reading...</a>

On stage was the Ukrainian soldier Oleksandr Budko, who lost both his legs in the war. “He was sitting on stage, without his prosthetics, and he started to dance,” says Alexei Ratmansky, who choreographed Giselle. “It was silence – 3,000 people as one, not breathing,” he remembers. The dancers joined in, lifting him high in the air. “It was one of the most moving experiences I’ve ever had,” says Ratmansky. “The response was tremendous.”</p><p>The two worlds of ballet and the battlefield seem so remote, but in the Ukraine war they have collided.

<p>The actor Johnny Flynn captures this debut novel’s offbeat humour and the intense loneliness of its protagonist in his terrific narration</p><p>Isaac and the Egg, the debut novel by Bobby Palmer, opens with Isaac Addy standing on a bridge at sunrise and considering whether to jump. He can’t recall how he got there though the taste in his mouth suggests he has been drinking. He can see his car at the end of the bridge, with the lights on and the driver’s door still open. Looking at the water below, Isaac lets out a scream of despair, at which “the weir stops bubbling, as if it’s paused to listen. The forest holds its breath. Time seems to stand still. Then, out of nowhere, something screams back.”</p><p>Isaac immediately goes in search of the source of the noise. What he finds is not an animal or a human but a living, breathing egg, about two feet tall and “eerily” white, “like a pearl at the centre of the biggest oyster on earth … In his heart, Isaac knows the egg has been abandoned. Like him. He already knows he’s going to take the egg home.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/25/isaac-and-the-egg-by-bobby-palmer-review-quirky-tender-tale-with-echoes-of-et">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A French bistro that will knock the fluff off your beret</p><p>  </p><p>Perhaps the Goodge Street area near London’s West End has never quite broken through as a destination dining spot because it simply sounds so unromantic. “Meet me on Goodge Street,” no one has ever purred seductively, although perhaps they should. Yes, Fitzrovia sounds like a bodily crevice, but it is also a hotbed of smart, impressive places such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/20/monica-galetti-leave-masterchef-focus-on-restaurant-family">Monica Galetti’s</a> <a href="https://mere-restaurant.com/">Mere</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/apr/15/lisboeta-london-w1-the-custard-tasted-like-bacony-trifle-restaurant-review">Lisboeta</a>, <a href="https://akoko.co.uk/">Akoko</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2004/aug/14/foodanddrink.shopping1">Roka</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/sep/30/rovi-london-ottolenghi-kitchen-ferments-with-gay-abandon-restaurant-review-jay-rayner">Rovi</a> and so on.

Woodhead creates earnestly thought-out restaurants with top-class chefs and diligent service. One of my happiest food memories is a lunch at Clipstone back when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/29/merlin-labron-johnson-portland-restaurant-clipstone-kitchen-encounters">Merlin Labron-Johnson </a>was chef, and The Quality Chop House, the home of mince on dripping toast and confit potatoes, never goes out of fashion.</p><p>You’d think Woodhead might call it a day after big hits such as these and preserve its magical legacy, but, instead, it has taken over a former travel agency, gutted it and re-imagined it as an elegant French bistro. Or at least a refined, compact, boutique restaurant of oak browns and bottle greens, serving scallops and lentils in <em>beurre blanc</em> with <em>pommes aligot</em>, rabbit niçoise salad and snail bonbons.

<p>Hester underlines the importance of place in this study of seven queer lives, from EM Forster to Josephine Baker</p><p>In historical accounts of queer lives and communities, a narrative arc of flight and self-fashioning dominates. Place, tradition, rootedness: these weigh heavily, sometimes lethally on the smalltown boy or girl with illicit or unruly desires. (Think Lou Reed, singing about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/14/they-didnt-go-round-the-corner-for-beer-lou-reed-and-john-cales-songs-for-drella" title="">Andy Warhol’s youth</a> in Pittsburgh: “You hate it – and you know you’ll have to leave.”) Even in a bustling metropolis, things can feel provisional – new identities shakily built along an archipelago of clubs, bars and cruising grounds. And yet, as the Irish writer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2021/feb/01/historical-tour-of-queer-cambridge-lgbtq" title="">Diarmuid Hester</a> argues, it all must transpire somewhere. Nothing Ever Just Disappears is a study of seven queer lives (plus a coda on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/derek-jarman" title="">Derek Jarman</a> and Dungeness) that seem to have transformed abstract space into meaningful place. Hester adopts a group-biography form that’s become familiar,, but writes about dissimilar and mostly unconnected figures, promising “a new history of queer culture and identity over the past 125 years”.</p><p>It begins in Cambridge, where Hester has studied and taught, and co-runs an LGBTQ+ performance night, <a href="https://cambsedition.co.uk/gigs-nightlife/one-year-of-club-urania/" title="">Club Urania</a>, which takes its name from late-Victorian artists, poets and intellectuals who campaigned for homosexual rights. That lineage haunts Hester’s first case study. He starts with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/28/maurice-by-em-forster-audiobook-review-ben-whishaw-narrates-a-groundbreaking-gay-novel" title="">EM Forster’s Maurice</a>, unpublished in his lifetime: a story of homosexual love, and even cross-class love, complete with a (not always admired) happy ending. In Cambridge, where Forster had dreamed of a sexual idyll he named the Greenwood, Hester visits the novelist’s room at King’s College and finds it is now a mundane space with a football table and Ikea sofa. It’s a letdown but leaves questions in his mind: how much of writing or art-making depends on place, how much on leaving it behind?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/25/nothing-ever-just-disappears-by-diarmuid-hester-review-room-with-a-view">Continue reading...</a>

## Pearl by Siân Hughes review – a circling story of memory and loss

<p>Taking a Middle English classic as its inspiration, this is a novel about a lasting grief that echoes through time</p><p>The unidentified 14th-century “Pearl poet” left behind a single manuscript written in Cheshire dialect, containing Pearl, Gawain and the Green Knight and two other religious poems. The manuscript is among the most treasured salvagings of Middle English literature, a crucial part of our rich inheritance as readers of English poetry. While most readers are more likely to know Gawain, Pearl is an extraordinary work about love, grief and faith, strikingly filled with suicidal ideation.</p><p>In her Booker-longlisted debut novel, award-winning poet <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sian-hughes">Siân Hughes</a> claims Pearl as a touchstone and source. A young mother, Marianne, recounts the death of her own mother and the years of grief that followed. As an exegesis of Pearl it’s slippery, recasting all the relationship dynamics to explore a different grief. The poem tells the story of a father’s grief for a lost daughter, so Hughes’s Pearl<em> </em>feels like a rather brilliant refraction, because while her story focuses on a bereaved child, there is still a grieving father, Edward, now in the supporting cast, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/16/rashomon-akira-kurosawas-truly-daring-film-is-still-electrifying">Rashomon retelling</a> that works to expand the landscape of loss the Pearl poet explored. And this is not the end of Hughes’s delicate redesign – as her tale unravels, it becomes clear that the lost “pearl” is another person entirely, and the grief we are concerned with in the bulk of this narrative is a kind of secondary product of an earlier loss, a tale told at one remove. Which, Pearl leads one to think, might be a way to imagine all griefs – the result of earlier losses stretching back and back to the beginning of the world.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/25/pearl-by-sian-hughes-review-a-circling-story-of-memory-and-loss">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A 1980s essay by Czech writer Milan Kundera on the peoples trapped between east and west is enjoying a new lease of life</p><p>“Are you a dissident?”, a journalist asked <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/milankundera">Milan Kundera</a>, when he had became exiled in France from his native Czechoslovakia in the mid-1970s. “No, I am a writer,” replied the author of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/12/milan-kundera-the-unbearable-lightness-of-being-author-dies-aged-94">The Unbearable Lightness of Being</a>. Not that he was indifferent to the plight of those who were opposing the Czech regime from inside, but he was wary of a political label being attached to a novel, and more generally to literature with a message, to art in the service of a political idea.</p><p>Yet Kundera, who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/12/milan-kundera-obituary">died last month</a>, was a man of ideas, which he explored particularly in his essays, the most influential being A Kidnapped West: The Tragedy of Central Europe, <a href="https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/milan-kundera/a-kidnapped-west/">published in Paris in 1983</a> and <a href="https://www.faber.co.uk/product/9780571378418-a-kidnapped-west/">republished in English</a> earlier this year. Central Europe, Kundera argued, belonged “culturally to the West, politically to the East and geographically in the centre”. The predicament of the small nations between Russia and Germany was that their existence was not “self-evident” but remained closely tied to the vitality of their culture, and historically intertwined with that of the west from which they had been “kidnapped” in 1945.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2023/aug/25/war-russian-aggression-central-europe-milan-kundera-east-west">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(International Anthem)</strong><br />The saxophonist-poet offers a looser, more eclectic counterpart to last year’s Gold, backed by skilled musicians who explore to striking effect</p><p>Angus Fairbairn, the Manchester-born, London-based musician who records under the name Alabaster Deplume, makes music that is extremely hard to classify. His albums feature some of Britain’s top jazz musicians, but you wouldn’t call it jazz. It’s an odd mix of creaky chamber music, clunky post-punk, lo-fi Afrobeat, avant-garde folk music and English whimsy. The self-taught saxophonist plays his tenor sax out of the side of his mouth in a breathy murmur, all simple phrases and fluttering, low-volume flourishes. He sings in mantras, occasionally lapsing into quite funny Robert Wyatt-ish spoken-word excursions. He also surrounds himself with fine musicians who push his simple songs into more challenging territory.</p><p>Last year’s album Gold was quite carefully plotted – each song was pre-written and recorded to a click-track with several different line ups; in post-production Fairbairn switched between those separate performances or layered them. This album features the more exploratory, improvised parts of those sessions. There is a heavy African influence: Guinean musician Falle Nioke brings his high-pitched, wordless vocals to several tracks, including the blissful opener, Sibonde, backed by Sarathy Korwar’s polyrhythmic drumming. Some are quite spartan: To That Voice and Say sees Fairbairn squawking out morse code messages on the sax while Ruth Goller plays bass guitar harmonics, and drummer Tom Skinner sounds like a drum kit falling down an endless staircase. Greek Honey Stick is just a duet for Fairbairn and Skinner – a thrillingly lo-fi mix of no wave guitars and drums.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/25/alabaster-deplume-come-with-fierce-grace-review-sublime-minimalist-improvisation">Continue reading...</a>

He smiled and chatted with the young women who, in turn, warmed up and peppered him with questions. Largely teenagers from marginalised communities, they were at the England base to learn coaching and leadership skills as part of a programme run by the group Football Beyond Borders. That they may not have instantly recognised the men’s boss is perhaps not surprising.

<p>Erik ten Hag needs solutions to address an unbalanced midfield that left Casemiro exposed against Wolves and Tottenham</p><p>The current feeling is a familiar one for Erik ten Hag and Manchester United. Their season is just two games old and performance levels have been markedly below expectation, as players grapple with the manager’s tactical demands. Just as they did 12 months ago – after damaging defeats to Brentford and Brighton in a stuttering start to Ten Hag’s reign – United find themselves under the microscope.</p><p>They were fortunate in their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/14/manchester-united-wolves-premier-league-match-report">league opener against Wolves</a>, ceding 23 shots but somehow escaping with a smash-and-grab victory. They were brighter, initially, at Tottenham, but in the second half became <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/19/tottenham-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report">overwhelmed by Ange Postecoglou’s energised side</a>. United’s dysfunctional midfield is taking the brunt of criticism from supporters and pundits, with questions surrounding the £55m acquisition of Mason Mount and former captain Gary Neville anticipating “big problems” if no more midfield signings are made. So whereas Ten Hag was able to find a near-perfect short-term solution with the addition of five-times Champions League winner Casemiro a year ago, the club are struggling to find the answers this time. What are Ten Hag’s options?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/25/manchester-united-casemiro-football-midfield">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Suspensions, injuries and a stymied attack: Argentina in France next month, or even Fiji on Saturday, will be scenting a real opportunity</p><p>What music is Steve Borthwick listening to at the moment? Looking down England’s team sheet it could just be that Oasis are back on his playlist. “Because maybe, you’re gonna be the one that saves me. And after all, you’re my wonderwall.” Given the pace at which bad news is multiplying, though, the most appropriate soundtrack for English rugby is currently anything by Blur.</p><p>So much for settled squads, clarity and leisurely fine-tuning. Borthwick is the most organised of men but when it was put to him on Thursday that he must be on Plan K or L by now he did not dispute it. With his captain and only specialist No 8 both suspended, his most athletic winger now a non-starter, further injuries wrecking his back-three options and the faith of supporters fast dissolving, England’s road to next month’s World Cup buildup could hardly be more potholed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/25/steve-borthwick-england-rugby-world-cup-owen-farrell">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Royal Concertgebouw O / Haitink/ Chailly/ Jansons/ Jochum/ Sanderling/ Tennstedt/ Mehta<br />(RCO Live, nine CDs)<br /></strong>In advance of Bruckner’s bicentenary, a roll call of tremendous historic interpretations is a timely reminder of this orchestra’s superb playing</p><p>The bicentenary of the birth of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/anton-bruckner">Anton Bruckner</a> may still be 12 months away, but the record companies are already mustering their anniversary celebrations. On Sony Classical, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/24/bruckner-symphonies-nos-1-and-5-etc-review-andris-nelsons">Christian Thielemann’s cycle of the symphonies</a> with the Vienna Philharmonic is well advanced for completion next year, while in two weeks’ time Deutsche Grammophon will release <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jul/20/bruckner-symphony-no-3-cd-review-andris-nelsons-gewandhaus-orchestra">the complete set of Bruckner recordings</a> that Andris Nelsons has been compiling over the last six years with the Leipzig Gewandhaus. Other archive-sourced sets will doubtless follow, but in the meantime the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra has got in first with a set of the nine numbered symphonies (that is not including the rarely performed early F minor and D minor works) all taken from concerts in the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam between 1972 and 2012. The recordings can already be streamed on Apple Music, and will be released on CD (both individually and in a box) on 8 September.</p><p>The RCO’s history of performing Bruckner may not be quite as remarkable as its pedigree in Mahler, but it has been a distinguished one, under a succession of chief conductors. It’s a shame that the set does not include anything conducted by Eduard van Beinum, who took over as the orchestra’s principal conductor after the liberation of the Netherlands in 1944, remaining in charge until his death in 1959, who made a point of including Bruckner in his programmes. But four of the conductors who followed Van Beinum over the next half century are represented here <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/oct/22/bernard-haitink-refined-conducting-made-him-true-master">Bernard Haitink</a> (who was chief conductor from 1961 to 1988) is represented by the First and Seventh Symphonies, Eugen Jochum (who shared the role with Haitink for the first two years of his tenure) by the Fifth, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/riccardo-chailly">Riccardo Chailly</a> (1988-2004) by the Second and Ninth, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/mariss-jansons">Mariss Jansons</a> (2004-2015) by the Sixth.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/25/bruckner-nine-symphonies-review-concertgebouws-early-gift-is-a-conducting-masterclass">Continue reading...</a>

## Eight Bears by Gloria Dickie review – the grizzly truth

<p>From spectacled to moon to polar, Dickie captures the majesty of these enigmatic creatures and their struggle to survive</p><p>“Bears are made of the same dust as we, and breathe the same winds and drink of the same waters.” So <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Gtk4ZqG4ogQC&amp;amp;pg=PA82&amp;amp;lpg=PA82&amp;amp;dq=John+Muir,+%22Thoughts+upon+Finding+a+Dead+Yosemite+Bear%22%C2%A0&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=DieCnHVpDl&amp;amp;sig=ACfU3U1mNX3B_u7YJdAXatg_uD0KOkzpag&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwicm72XobaAAxWQh1wKHcnjD8QQ6AF6BAgiEAM#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=John%20Muir%2C%20%22Thoughts%20upon%20Finding%20a%20Dead%20Yosemite%20Bear%22%C2%A0&amp;amp;f=false" title="">wrote</a> John Muir in his journal in 1871 after finding a dead bear in Yosemite – presumably <em>Ursus arctos horribilis</em>, a grizzly. If one considers the characteristics of the grizzly, this is quite a remarkable thing to write.<strong> </strong>We are not closely related to bears (their closest living relative is a seal), and grizzlies make for terrible company. And yet Muir was not alone in feeling that bears are somehow kin: we (or at least we in the west) tell stories about friendly bears; we fall asleep beside toys formed in their image; some have even tried to <a href="https://www.traffic.org/news/malaysia-celebrity-fined-for-illegal-possession-of-sun-bear-cub/" title="">keep them as pets</a> or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/feb/03/1" title="">live with them in the wild</a>.</p><p>This imagined kinship forms just one thread in Gloria Dickie’s book Eight Bears. It’s a family album of the remaining varieties of bear, but the book does more than its title suggests. Just like a good photography critic, Dickie is attuned to the person behind the camera: how we have framed bears over the centuries, enmeshing them in the stories that we tell about ourselves. As Dickie shows, bears are in deep trouble, and her book is a compelling attempt to see through their eyes: to explore what it means to be a bear in a warming world that is short on space.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/25/eight-bears-by-gloria-dickie-review-the-grizzly-truth">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Tories always had a capacity for shapeshifting, but now something has gone wrong. Have they just run out of ideas?</p><p>Late one night in 1867, Benjamin Disraeli, chancellor of the exchequer in Lord Derby’s Tory government, cunningly thwarted a Liberal wrecking amendment in the Commons to his second reform bill. Having written to Queen Victoria at 2am, he went to the Carlton Club, where he was cheered and toasted as “the man who rode the race, who took the time, who kept the time, and who did the trick”. The following year he became prime minister.</p><p>Much the same words may have been used in the small hours of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/bombastic-boris-johnson-wins-huge-majority-on-promise-to-get-brexit-done">13 December 2019</a>, when Boris Johnson pranced about Conservative central office in London, pumping his fists in the air as his adoring staff and colleagues embraced him. In the less than five months he had been Tory leader and prime minister, Johnson had purged his parliamentary party of some of its best and most honourable people, had precipitated a general election by dubious and possibly unlawful means, had then fought the election on a promise to “Get Brexit done” – and had won the Tories’ largest parliamentary majority for more than 30 years.

<p>The director of the brutally bleak Gomorrah has turned his lens on migration, casting two newcomers in a nuanced look at a small-boats crossing. But will his young protagonists fare any better than his wannabe gangsters?</p><p>Italian director Matteo Garrone is a reliable crusher of hopes and aspirations. In his 2008 breakthrough crime drama Gomorrah<em>, </em>two fresh-faced Neapolitan youngsters aspire to emulate the mobsters they’ve seen portrayed in American gangster movies: they end up being shot by a bunch of pot-bellied mafia grandpas in flip-flops, and carted off by a digger.</p><p>Garrone’s 2019 retelling of Pinocchio had the titular wooden boy join a caravan of children headed for a mythical Land of Toys – only to be transformed into a donkey, crippled in a circus show, and thrown into the sea. Wide-eyed boys who dare to dream ending up as landfill is such a persistent theme in the 54-year-old Roman film-maker’s works, it’s probably quite useful that the two teenage protagonists of his most recent project weren’t familiar with his back catalogue before they signed up.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/25/matteo-garrone-io-capitano-interview">Continue reading...</a>
