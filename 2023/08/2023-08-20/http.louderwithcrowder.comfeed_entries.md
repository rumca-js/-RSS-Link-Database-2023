If you're saying to yourself, "But Brodigan, don't young people have Spotify and Apple Music like the rest of us?" That's what I thought. It appears Yoto is unique in that, to appeal to young people, it will remove songs that might trigger zoomers' poor little fee-fees. For example, Queen's 1978 body positivity anthem "Fat Bottom Girls" has been removed from the band's greatest hits album.</p><p>Before we go any further, it is important that some of you younger readers are familiar with the source material. Also, and I can't stress this enough, the song f*cking rocks!</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>According to the exclusive from <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-12424449/We-woke-Classic-Queen-song-Fat-Bottomed-Girls-mysteriously-dropped-groups-new-Greatest-Hits-collection.html" target="_blank">The Daily Mail</a>:</p><blockquote>But 45 years later, it appears that lyrics such as 'left alone with big fat Fanny, she was such a naughty nanny, big woman, you made a bad boy out of me' and 'fat bottomed girls, you make the rockin' world go round' have been hit by the woke cancel culture. But last week it was nowhere to be seen when Universal Records announced they would be releasing a version of the record on Yoto, the new audio platform aimed at young people.<br /><br />One [industry insider] told The Mail on Sunday: 'It is the talk of the music industry, nobody can work out why such a good-natured, fun song can't be acceptable in today's society.<br /><span></span><br />'It is woke gone mad. Why not appreciate people of all shapes and sizes like society is saying we should, rather than get rid of it.<br /></blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>I'd be curious to hear what songwriter Brian May, one of the greatest to ever pick up a guitar, has to say. He has <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/brian-may-queen-brit-awards" target="_blank">spoken out about woke nonsense before</a>. "Fat Bottom Girls" isn't just about body positivity, it's also about non-binary body positivity. May said in a 2008 interview "I wrote it with [Freddie Mercury] in mind, as you do, especially if you've got a great singer who likes fat-bottomed girls... or boys."</p><p>Note: Queen lead singer Freddie Mercury was gay. And I get the feeling if he was still around he'd be one of those bougie gays who <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/target-pride-collection" target="_blank">thinks things have gone too far</a>. He definitely would suffer fools who don't see the cheekiness in: "Left alone with big fat Fanny/She was such a naughty nanny/Heap big woman, you made a bad boy out of me."</p><p>Welcome to 2023, where in order to appeal to the youth <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/john-cleese-life-of-brian" target="_blank">you have to censor songs people have enjoyed for decades</a> because a handful of emotional hemophiliacs who think the world began the day they were born might have a sad. No rock song will be safe.</p><p>Led Zepplin's "Immigrant Song" will get yeeted because it's insensitive to undocumented asylum seekers.</p><p>Kiss's "Love Gun," a song written about Paul Stanley's d*ck and how a girl is going to get some of his d*ck (name the movie), has gotta go since we're told to believe girls have d*cks now too. Also, the word "gun."</p><p>Kansas' "Carry On Wayward Son" is no good because the son is another cis white male.</p><p>Is the sugar in Def Leppard' "Pour Some Sugar on Me" ethically sourced? If not...see ya.</p><p>Van Halen's... really, anything sung by David Lee Roth is no bueno.</p><p>And Dio's "Hungry for Heaven" is anti-science because it breaks of Christianity, what with all this talk about "Heaven." Say goodbye to Warrant and Bryan Adams too.</p><p>Folks, this is what you buy vinyl. Having hard copies of your music library is the only way you'll still have access to the songs you love.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

Prior to leaving on another vacation, he praised FEMA director Michael Brown saying "Heckuva job Brownie" for his response to Hurricane Katrin... wait, wrong natural disaster. Biden was discussing the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/4-things-caused-the-maui-wildfires" target="_blank">Maui Wildfires</a>. Where he forgot the word "Maui."</p><p>Or, SEEMINGLY forgot the word "Maui." Once enough of us right-wing bloggers have too much fun writing "what a f*cking idiot," the "independent" "fact" checkers will be deployed to tell us what Joe meant to say. Until then...</p><p>"The Army helicopters helped fire suppression and efforts on the Big Island - because there's still some burning on the Big Island.

<p>Hey, at least he found something else to say besides "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-no-comment-maui" target="_blank">no comment</a>." Amirite, folks?</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>Biden's latest brain shart was <a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/watch-biden-appears-to-forget-the-name-maui-refers-to-it-as-the-one-you-see-on-television-all-the-time" target="_blank">flagged by The Post Millennial,</a> who to be fair to President Puddinghead acknowledged "Biden referred to the island earlier in the speech." It was just at this moment when his mouth needed to say "Maui" but his brain could only think "Meow, meow, meow, meow."</p><p>And I get your disappointment that TPM flagged this before we here at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website noticed. In our defense, this was Biden's speech in Milwaukee (Algonquin for "the good land") last week. The appearance was one of his bigger trainwrecks. There was so much derp, him forgetting the name of an Island that is being burnt to the ground fell through the cracks.</p><p>This was the event where Biden bragged he was giving Maui households who lost everything a whole $700 to rebuild their lives. In comparison, Ukraine has <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-maui-wildfire-700" target="_blank">been given $2500 per person</a>.</p><p>Joe also bragged about signing the bipartisan... Infralocture? Finshalogshun? Bipartisanspaghettisandwich? We still don't know. Biden is a public appearance or two away from telling the American people, for no apparent reason whatsoever, "I like cheese."</p><p>The people on the big island you see on TV have had no comment on Biden's latest gaffe. <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2023/08/17/sara-sidner-kjp-maui-fires/" target="_blank">None of them have electricity</a> so they didn't see it.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
