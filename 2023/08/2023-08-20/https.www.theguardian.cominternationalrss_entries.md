## ‘Cooking brought me back to my senses’: the recipes that rekindled my appetite for life

<p>A tuna salad from her mother-in-law; a raspberry meringue from chef Jeremy Lee. In this extract from her new book, Bee Wilson discovers the secret of cooking lies in a little help from your friends</p><p><em>The Secret of Cooking</em> sprang from personal experience. I wanted to crack the code of how to fit cooking into the everyday mess and imperfection of all our lives without it seeming like yet another un-doable thing on the to-do list or yet another reason to berate ourselves for falling short. My own relationship with cooking changed, suddenly, about a year into this project. In June 2020, in the middle of the pandemic, my husband of 23 years, the father of my three children, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/may/21/husband-left-me-headed-for-kitchen-how-comfort-food-can-save-the-soul" title="">left me for another woman</a>. For much of that year, I resembled Munch’s painting <em>The Scream</em> (or at least, that is how I felt). I tried anything I could think of to take my mind off the grief – watching box sets, yoga, reading novels, vodka – but almost everything reminded me of him, especially the vodka. With social distancing in place, I couldn’t hug friends. My mother, who had dementia, was in a care home where I wasn’t allowed to visit. To cap it all, I suddenly had to do all the laundry and all the cooking. This wasn’t such a shift; we never divided the cooking 50/50. But there is still a difference between being the person who does the majority of the cooking and being the person in charge of all of it.</p><p>To my surprise, I found that my enforced new role came with benefits. In my lonely state, the kitchen was one of the few places I felt better rather than worse. Cooking anchored me to the person I had been before I met my husband. I could make myself a chicken stew with the sweet scent of parsley and white wine which reminded me of the stews my mother used to make. No matter how tearful I had been the night before, I still had to get up in the morning and cook breakfast for my son, who was then 11. The act of cracking eggs into a jug to make his favourite pancakes or waffles felt steadying and gave me back my appetite.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/aug/20/bee-wilson-tuna-salad-raspberry-meringue-recipes-secret-of-cooking">Continue reading...</a>

## O Brother by John Niven review – a searing study of siblings who go separate ways

<p>The novelist brings skill and hard-won wisdom to a meditation on the contrast between his life and his brother’s struggles and early death</p><p>While hardly well trodden, the path from the provincial working class to metropolitan literary success is not exactly virgin territory. It’s the journey that in the 1950s and 1960s produced the new wave of writers such as Alan Sillitoe and David Storey, often referred to as “angry young men”.</p><p>That description rather did for the aspirant male working class that followed in its wake, reducing social mobility to cliche and ambition to a questionable form of masculinity. John Niven is not unaware of the pitfalls in telling this particular story, but in <em>O Brother</em>, his riotous and yet bracingly moving memoir, he doesn’t so much attempt to skirt around them as jump in with all his senses on red alert: a seasoned nose for trouble, an acute ear for comic dialogue and an unsparing eye for his own condescension.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/20/o-brother-by-john-niven-review-a-searing-study-of-siblings-who-go-separate-ways">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘House hushing’ is a new interiors trend that’s making (the right kind of) noise in these troubling times. Here, experts reveal how to turn down the volume and create peace</p><p>I really want a quiet life. Everything feels overwhelming to this frazzled midlifer; my mind is a hot mess of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwich_generation" title="">sandwich generation</a>” stresses, work anxiety and impending planetary doom. I have tried to foster the calm I crave: we moved to a detached house in a quiet suburb; installed secondary glazing and thick curtains; I put my desk facing the garden. So why, when I enter what should be my haven from a noisy world, do I feel so wired? Where’s my peace and tranquillity?</p><p>Well, let’s take a look at what greets me when I arrive home, as seen through the eyes of Rachel Cordingley, from home organisation and decluttering company, A Tidy Mind: “Paper, paper, shoes, shoes, shoes… chicken postcards… WD40.

<p>An idea born of lockdown conversations over Zoom, Macdonald and Blaché’s intriguing sci-fi is infused with their own cultural nostalgia</p><p>To those readers who know <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/authors/229626/helen-macdonald?tab=penguin-biography">Helen Macdonald</a> from their exact and wonderful writing about the natural world, including the bestselling memoir of grief <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/04/h-is-for-hawk-review-helen-macdonald-taming-goshawk-mabel">H </a></em><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/04/h-is-for-hawk-review-helen-macdonald-taming-goshawk-mabel">Is for Hawk</a></em>, this book, a trippy, philosophical science-fiction novel with the pacing of a thriller and the pulse of a romance, is an unusual departure. Macdonald – who, like their co-author and friend <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/authors/295080/sin-blache?tab=penguin-biography">Sin Blaché</a>, uses the pronoun they – has described in recent interviews how the book was born of the frustrations of lockdown, when the pair of them filled some of the downtime with internet chats about a shared interest in science-fiction and the TV and video games of their childhood. Those conversations not only prompted the writing of this novel but also its plotline.</p><p><em>Prophet</em> begins deep in the Suffolk countryside, where, near a Nato airbase, an American diner, complete with jukebox and chrome fittings, has appeared overnight fully formed in a field. It glows neon in the twilight but there is no source for its power, no plumbing for its water. On the base itself other objects have been appearing, without obvious histories: a bunch of roses, a cabbage patch doll, a Scrabble box, a kid’s bike, a Pac-Man arcade game. These appearances have coincided with the death of an airman at the base, incinerated in a bonfire of his own making.</p><p><em>Prophet</em> by Helen Macdonald and Sin Blaché is published by Jonathan Cape (£18.99).
