The Ahsoka Disney Plus series brings the continued story of one of Star Wars’ greatest heroes, Ahsoka Tano. The Ahsoka trailer spells the Star Wars screen introduction of Thrawn on Disney Plus along with other such animated characters like Sabine Wren from Star Wars Rebels. In the history of Star Wars, Ahsoka holds a special place among the Lucasfilm pantheon, will this be the peak of her story?

First appearing in live-action on the Disney+ hit, The Mandalorian, Rosario Dawsonleads the cast of the Ahsoka series as we view her continued adventures– but where will she go? To help prepare, we’re looking into her past from Tales of the Jedi to Star Wars: The Clone Wars (but not The Clone Wars movie, which doesn’t contain Ahsoka Tano), The Clones Wars series epic finale, her involvement in the Siege of Mandalore, and Star Wars: Rebels.

That happened between the Ahsoka Tano (Rebels era) to Ahsoka Tano (The Mandalorian era)? Though we have clues from The Mandalorian and the Book of Fett, we’re ready to know the truth about where he life took her, and how she became friends with her old master’s son, Luke Skywalker. Have we seen the last cameo from Luke Skywalker? Ahsoka the series seems like a great place to reintroduce him,and fill in some more gaps in Star Wars history.
