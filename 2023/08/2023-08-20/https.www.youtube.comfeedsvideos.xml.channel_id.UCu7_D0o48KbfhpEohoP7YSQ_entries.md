Unfortunately, most soil moisture sensors used in our Arduino, ESP8266, or ESP32 projects destroy themselves after a short while. We need a better solution.
Today we will test different sensors, and I will show you how they work and why most sensors from China destroy themselves. And, of course, we will find a solution to the problem.
