I've resisted it for several years.  You guys wanted a DTOS distro and I have always been reluctant to undertake such a project.  So I created the DTOS post-installation script which was a quasi-distro...innovative in some ways but also a major pain to support due to variances among Arch-based distros.  So I've decided to scrap the post-installation and just do what everyone does...build an ISO and make a proper GNU/Linux distro.
