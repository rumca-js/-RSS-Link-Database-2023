Once Szabo is inside the sculpture, made by artist Jacinthe Derasp, it seems to have its own life; shapeshifting from snoozing beast to puffer fish to armadillo to sharp-toothed monster to feathery exotic bird to a designer version of Jabba the Hutt.

Happily, they\u2019re good angles, so it\u2019s fine. The story goes like this. Yorkshire chef Sam Pullan, previously of the Bear at Carriages in Knaresborough, took a lease a couple of years back on a corner space just off Briggate in Leeds, formerly called La Strega. With his partner Nicole Deighton he planned to open a caf\u00e9 called Appys. In 2020, when renovations began, they pulled back the Strega shopfront to discover a sweeping red and gold sign for the Empire Caf\u00e9, a name that almost certainly references the Empire Theatre, one of the great music halls of Leeds, which opened just a street away in 1898. Further research revealed that this corner of Fish Street had been a dining room since 1884.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/aug/20/jay-rayner-restaurant-review-the-empire-cafe-leeds-it-made-me-smile\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/aug/20/jay-rayner-restaurant-review-the-empire-cafe-leeds-it-made-me-smile", "date_published": "2023-08-20T05:02:38+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "What could you get for \u00a3150,000 in 1988?", "description": "How about a four-bed villa on the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur?<p>What can you get for \u00a3150,000?

At the top, you have the aristocrats of Champagne who believe fine sparkling wine can only be achieved by the so-called m\u00e9thode champenoise, in which the wine is given its second fermentation in the bottle. These nobles of fizz tend to look down, perhaps with a tinge of jealousy, on the Italian winemakers behind prosecco, who have secured enormous success with wines made using the inarguably cheaper, less labour-intensive charmat method, where the second fermentation takes place in large, pressurised tanks. I prefer to see the differences in each as a matter of style rather than quality or class: and there are times when the sherbet-frothy softness of a good prosecco, such as Mionetto\u2019s, is exactly what I\u2019m after.</p><p><strong>Bramble Hill Sparkling Wine, England NV (\u00a316, <a href=\"https://www.marksandspencer.com/bramble-hill-sparkling-wine-of-england-case-of-6/p/wnp60573275\">Marks &amp; Spencer</a>) </strong>The whole tank v bottle distinction may come across as a bit \u2018narcissism of small differences\u2019 to the casual drinker. But it matters a great deal to those involved. It\u2019s certainly a live issue in the fast-evolving UK wine scene, for example, where the emergence of a new wave of charmat-method wines has offended the sensibilities of many representatives of the existing sparkling wine scene. The worry for the established British names, such as Nyetimber, Gusbourne and Ridgeview, is that their hard-won reputation for high-quality, Champagne-rivalling bottle-fermented fizz will be dragged down by what they see as a cheap and cheerful imitator riding on their coattails. Personally, I can\u2019t see the problem of broadening England\u2019s vinous offer to take in more affordable sparkling bottles \u2013 provided it\u2019s clear on the label, so we know what we might expect when we open a soft-and-easy, English charmat fizz, such as Bramble Hill.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/aug/20/bubbling-up-sparkling-wine-without-snobbery\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/aug/20/bubbling-up-sparkling-wine-without-snobbery", "date_published": "2023-08-20T05:00:38+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Hospital chief claims he acted \u2018promptly\u2019 to move Letby off ward", "description": "<p>Tony Chambers says he was not aware of serious concerns being raised until June 2016  \u2013 a year after the nurse was linked to a series of unusual infant deaths</p><p>The former chief executive of the hospital where Lucy Letby murdered seven babies said he first heard \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the nurse in June 2016 \u2013 a year after she was linked to a series of unusual infant deaths.</p><p>However, Tony Chambers, who left the Countess of Chester hospital shortly after Letby\u2019s arrest, said he was told at the time that she was an \u201centhusiastic, capable and committed nurse\u201d, despite the fears of senior doctors.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/20/hospital-chief-claims-he-acted-promptly-to-move-letby-off-ward\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/20/hospital-chief-claims-he-acted-promptly-to-move-letby-off-ward", "date_published": "2023-08-20T05:00:38+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "TV tonight: Stormzy\u2019s phenomenal live set in east London", "description": "<p>The Croydon rapper plays All Points East.
