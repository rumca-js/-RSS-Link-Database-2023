We need a better solution.\nToday we will test different sensors, and I will show you how they work and why most sensors from China destroy themselves. And, of course, we will find a solution to the problem.\n\nMy second channel: https://www.youtube.com/HB9BLAWireless\n\nLinks:\nGood (capacitive) moisture sensors: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DlKIBKJ or https://amzn.to/3YDFBUu\nAnother type: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DdJLbld\n\nPatreon supporter companies:\nhttps://passiv-energie.gmbh/\nhttps://www.welectron.com/\nhttps://yosmart.com/\nYouTuber Patreon: https://www.youtube.com/@MakersMashup/\n\nThe links above usually are affiliate links that support the channel (at no additional cost to you).\nSupporting Material and Blog Page: http://www.sensorsiot.org\nGitHub: https://www.github.com/sensorsiot\nMy Patreon Page: https://www.patreon.com/AndreasSpiess\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/JfgDSa8\nIf you want to support the channel, please use the links below to start your shopping.
