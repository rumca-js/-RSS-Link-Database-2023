You guys wanted a DTOS distro and I have always been reluctant to undertake such a project.  So I created the DTOS post-installation script which was a quasi-distro...innovative in some ways but also a major pain to support due to variances among Arch-based distros.  So I've decided to scrap the post-installation and just do what everyone does...build an ISO and make a proper GNU/Linux distro.\n\nLINKS:\n\u25ba https://sourceforge.net/projects/dtos/\n\nWANT TO SUPPORT THE CHANNEL? \n\ud83d\udcb0 Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/distrotube \n\ud83d\udcb3 Paypal: https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=channel_banner&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbFF3eGpGSzM5Vk1PMGlENllqckpHeERYWWRld3xBQ3Jtc0tuUVNSYno2bjFGSG1MTGdfYkJnanhhU1o3ODdxejVWZzNTeHhLX0p4VUIwR01PMmF1MEtpdWVYMnppVXBuTmluSU16OFhHUmIyQ2Qyc3Z5MElJSkdMTExSRlRUUm9zZUhoLVVwcmxFdDlhZFhKNnpNZw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paypal.com%2Fcgi-bin%2Fwebscr%3Fcmd%3D_donations%26business%3Dderek%2540distrotube%252ecom%26lc%3DUS%26item_name%3DDistroTube%26no_note%3D0%26currency_code%3DUSD%26bn%3DPP%252dDonationsBF%253abtn_donateCC_LG%252egif%253aNonHostedGuest\n\ud83d\udecd\ufe0f Amazon: https://amzn.to/2RotFFi\n\ud83d\udc55 Teespring: https://teespring.com/stores/distrotube\n\nDONATE CRYPTO:\n\ud83d\udcb0 Bitcoin: 1Mp6ebz5bNcjNFW7XWHVht36SkiLoxPKoX\n\ud83d\udc36 Dogecoin: D5fpRD1JRoBFPDXSBocRTp8W9uKzfwLFAu\n\ud83d\udcd5 LBC: bMfA2c3zmcLxPCpyPcrykLvMhZ7A5mQuhJ\n\nSOCIAL PLATFORMS: \n\ud83d\udde8\ufe0f Mastodon: https://fosstodon.org/@distrotube\n\ud83d\udc6b Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/DistroTube/\n\ud83d\udcfd\ufe0f LBRY/Odysee: https://odysee.com/$/invite/@DistroTu...\n\nDT ON THE WEB:\n\ud83d\udd78\ufe0f Website: http://distro.tube\n\ud83d\udcc1 GitLab: https://gitlab.com/dwt1  \n\nFREE AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE THAT I USE:\n\ud83c\udf10 Brave Browser - https://brave.com/dis872 \n\ud83d\udcfd\ufe0f Open Broadcaster Software: https://obsproject.com/\n\ud83c\udfac Kdenlive: https://kdenlive.org\n\ud83c\udfa8 GIMP: https://www.gimp.org/\n\ud83c\udfb5 Ardour: https://ardour.org/\n\ud83d\udcbb VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/\n\ud83d\uddd2\ufe0f Doom Emacs: https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs\n\nYour support is very much appreciated.
