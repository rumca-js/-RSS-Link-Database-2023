## Chinese video games are on the rise, but I wish they got more respect

<p>China is the world’s biggest gaming market, where a culture of creativity has  flourished – so please do not conflate companies and players with a repressive regime that cracks down on individual expression</p><p>One of the most popular video games in the world today is Chinese. Not that everyone would be aware of the fact, or would care, but that game is Genshin Impact and it was created by Shanghai-based miHoYo. Its style and characters are greatly influenced by anime, and many players might have thought Genshin was Japanese-developed; it is telling that miHoYo is inspired by that country’s culture. Despite being the world’s biggest video games market, China still remains relatively minor as an international cultural force in games.</p><p>Video games are one of the few creative media not dominated by the US. In consoles, two of the platform holders are from Japan, while developers in the UK and Europe are powerhouses of creativity. But the world’s biggest games company is Chinese giant <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/tencent">Tencent</a>, which is often the target of racism and online criticism. While massive corporations don’t need huge sympathy, as a Briton of Chinese heritage, it does pain me when Chinese games companies are falsely conflated with the Chinese government.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/aug/21/chinese-video-games-are-on-the-rise-but-i-wish-they-got-more-respect">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Inspired by an Edwardian guidebook, our writer walks the 65-mile length of the county’s most famous river</p><p>The swaying trees closed ranks in the darkness, obscuring my route. In theory a public footpath led through them: the next stage in my quest to walk the entire length of the River Wharfe.</p><p>I hunched over my Ordnance Survey map, trying to protect my phone’s light from the blowing rain and lamenting my lack of a headtorch. When I looked up, every sweep of my light made the slightest open area look like a footpath. So I decided to cut my losses and leave the river behind. Nearby, a quiet B-road would be mostly deserted at this hour, and would convey me straight into my destination – the Yorkshire Dales village of Appletreewick, where a warm, dry pub awaited me.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/aug/21/trek-to-the-source-of-the-wharfe-a-riverside-adventure-in-yorkshire">Continue reading...</a>

## Duet with a doppelganger: Edinburgh fringe dances to a different tune

<p>The festival’s Dance Base hosts eclectic performances involving a wondrous paper sculpture, an examination of duality and Bach reimagined</p><p>There are more shows at the fringe than you could ever watch, but that hides the fact that artists and venues are struggling with rising costs and funding cuts. Edinburgh’s Dance Base, a year-round arts organisation, announced it was reducing its activity earlier in the year, and for the festival is presenting a slimmed-down programme in association with Assembly. What hasn’t changed is the eclectic mix of local and international artists, and work that surprises, delights and disappoints, sometimes all in the same show. (Dance Base also hosts a poignant photographic exhibition of dancers living in Ukraine, which is worth checking out if you’re nearby.)</p><p>One of the best current shows is <a href="https://www.petrikordanse.com/habitat">Bettina Szabo’s Habitat</a> (★★★★), a solo that rests on one incredible prop, a spiky sculpture made from of 600 paper cones, like a long origami cape, or Issey Miyake’s take on a hedgehog costume. It looks unassuming laid on the stage as Szabo slowly flexes and unfolds her body, moving side-to-side, a hermit crab looking for its next home. She’s miked up, and her increasingly urgent breaths form part of the ambient soundscore. When she finally finds her new shell you hear long exhales of relief, breath catching at the bottom of her lungs – it’s these kind of close details that really make the piece. Once Szabo is inside the sculpture, made by artist Jacinthe Derasp, it seems to have its own life; shapeshifting from snoozing beast to puffer fish to armadillo to sharp-toothed monster to feathery exotic bird to a designer version of Jabba the Hutt. It’s remarkable to watch the possibilities.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/20/edinburgh-fringe-dance-base">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Louise Brealey is put-upon Helen, a chicken factory worker who gets a second chance at love, in Pugh’s generous and gritty film</p><p>Here’s a rousing empowerment-anthem of a movie that’s not afraid to paint its romance plotline in big, bold brushstrokes; occasionally it overdoes things but the rush of emotion carries everything along in its path, helped by the deployment of radio-friendly standards by Neil Diamond and the like that turns the film into an impromptu musical and allows <a href="https://www.janispugh.co.uk/">writer-director Janis Pugh</a> to stage (relatively) elaborate dance sequences and big emotional scenes.</p><p>The central figure is put-upon chicken-processing factory worker Helen (played by Louise Brealey) who has a complicated domestic situation: she lives in the same crummy terrace as her oafish husband Gary, from whom she is separated but seemingly not actually divorced, and shares the place with his new, much younger, girlfriend Amy (Emily Fairn) and their newly arrived baby. Also on the premises is Gary’s terminally ill mother Gwen (Sorcha Cusack), for whom Helen acts a carer but is the quasi-maternal figure that Helen appears to long for. There’s also a rowdy Greek chorus of Helen’s fellow factory workers who are perhaps designed as a counterpoint to Helen’s introverted, clenched unhappiness, at least at first.</p><p>Chuck Chuck Baby screened at the Edinburgh film festival</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/edinburgh-festival-2023+tone/reviews">All of our Edinburgh festival reviews</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/20/chuck-chuck-baby-review-whimsy-and-realism-combine-in-big-hearted-romance">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sarina Wiegman’s 3-4-1-2 system carried them to the final but was undone by one moment of miscommunication</p><p>One instance. One rush of over-enthusiasm. One split second of miscommunication. That was enough to see England’s World Cup dreams lie in tatters. It was a moment that caused the holes to appear in the Lionesses’ new-found tactical formation, a system that had been a huge key to their success in Australia but also, on this occasion, led to their downfall.</p><p>It all happened in a flash with little under half an hour on the clock. Lucy Bronze, a forward-thinking wing-back, surged ahead on an inverted run. Whether she needed to go at that particular moment is a separate debate, with the game firmly in the balance. Miscommunication followed, allowing Spain to win the ball back. A deft crossfield pass set Mariona Caldentey away into the space vacated by Bronze and gave her the room to set up Olga Carmona for the finish.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/aug/20/spain-england-tactics-womens-world-cup-final">Continue reading...</a>

## Michail Antonio downs Chelsea to give 10-man West Ham victory

<p>If the future looks bright for Chelsea the present reality is that they still lack conviction in both boxes. They dominated long stretches of this game, played the smoother football and still fell to their first defeat under Mauricio Pochettino. West Ham had too much nous, even after being reduced to 10 men midway through the second half, and would charge to a deserved win after punishing Chelsea’s errors at both ends of the pitch.</p><p>The narrative belonged to Lucas Paquetá, whose move to Manchester City <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/18/west-hams-lucas-paqueta-investigated-by-fa-for-potential-betting-breaches">fell apart after news of a Football Association investigation</a> over potential betting breaches emerged late last week. West Ham’s No 10 grew in influence as the contest progressed, making a mockery of fears that he would not be in a mental state to play, and he sealed it when he scored from the spot in added time. That the penalty had been given away by Moisés Caicedo, Chelsea’s new £115m midfielder, only added to Pochettino’s misery.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/20/west-ham-chelsea-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Would it have been better if they’d won? Sure. But the team has won the respect their game has been denied a century – and challenged the country’s deeply ingrained sexism</p><p>Millie Bright, captain of the Lionesses, is “absolutely heartbroken” that the England women’s team lost to Spain; they all are. The players are probably not in the mood to take the long view on what they’ve done for women’s football, and what women’s football has done for the country. My slender understanding of life at the top of an international sport is that you have to take it pretty seriously on a game-by-game basis, and the time for a philosophical approach is when you retire.</p><p>Yet it has taken just over a century for the women’s game to get back to the kind of adulation and spectator numbers it enjoyed just <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jun/13/how-the-fa-banned-womens-football-in-1921-and-tried-to-justify-it">before it was banned by the Football Association (FA)</a> in 1921. That ban was lifted just over 50 years later, which signalled a revival, but not a fast one: the first official women’s Euros were held 13 years later and the first Women’s World Cup didn’t take place until 1991. You can’t really account for that sluggish pace without figuring out why it was banned in the first place. The FA’s given reason was broad and weak – “the game of football is quite unsuitable for females and ought not to be encouraged” – and had a supposed basis in medicine, in the idea that the female frame was too delicate for the game.

With traditional TV viewership continuing to decline among younger generations, impressionists are faced with a new challenge – today’s digital natives may not readily recognise the people they are impersonating.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/aug/20/how-impressionists-keep-audiences-laughing-in-an-age-of-social-media-celebrities">Continue reading...</a>

The deficit is somewhat ameliorated for those with private pension income.<br /><br />This results in about 2.1 million pensioners living in poverty. Whatever its political intentions, the economic effect of the triple lock was the gradual and modest increase in the relative wellbeing of the poorest pensioners. However, as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/25/britains-great-unretirement-cost-of-living-drives-older-people-back-to-work" title="">the Guardian has noted</a>, that went into reverse in 2022. Since then, pensioners solely on state pensions have benefited relative to average incomes, but remain among the poorest section of the population whose real inflation rate (driven by food and energy costs) is far higher than the increases received.</p><p>Similarly, many of those with private pensions (typically invested in the bond market) will have suffered loss of income due to the falling value of these investments. It is therefore inappropriate to single out pensioners as a group who have benefited while the general population has suffered.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/aug/20/triple-lock-helps-the-poorest-pensioners">Continue reading...</a>

<p>England under Steve Borthwick are going nowhere, flat and plodding, and desperately need a tactical reboot before next month</p><p>Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results is often regarded as the definition of insanity. A monochrome, one-paced England team, who have now lost four of their past five games, are certainly not learning swiftly from their mistakes and the odds on Steve Borthwick’s side underperforming at the upcoming Rugby World Cup continue to shorten.</p><p>If they keep playing in the same plodding fashion they did at the Aviva Stadium, there is also no guarantee people will continue to want to watch them. England have had their barren periods in the professional era but rarely have they tested their supporters’ faith so relentlessly. Limited, formulaic, depressing – and that is just the post-match press conferences. Out on the pitch even their smartest players are now doing a good impression of brainwashed zombies.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/20/england-must-change-course-or-they-are-heading-for-disaster-at-world-cup">Continue reading...</a>

<p>If there was a moment that summed up the festering frustrations among Everton supporters then it arrived on 38 minutes, by which point this bludgeoning was as good as over. Dominic Calvert-Lewin headed for the tunnel holding an ice pack to his face as a result of an earlier collision with Emiliano Martínez and a swell of travelling fans jeered his premature exit. Calvert-Lewin, who completed 90 minutes in a friendly at the beginning of the week, responded by sarcastically putting his right thumb up by way of thanks and muttered a few words under his breath.</p><p>For the second successive season, Everton have zero points from their opening two matches. The painful reality is Aston Villa wiped the floor with Everton. This fixture is the most played in English league history, the game their 211th top-flight meeting, but on this evidence Everton have much work to do to ensure a repeat of this trip next season. It seemed Sean Dyche’s side might even get off lightly until the Villa substitute Jhon Durán scored with his first touches.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/20/aston-villa-everton-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Vigils are planned to honor the memory of the whale who was captive for 53 years as her death ripples across the country</p><p>On Friday, as the captive orca whale known as Tokitae was dying in Miami, an unusual phenomenon took place in the waters where she was taken from her pod back in 1970. A rare superpod meetup of three clans – the J, K, and L pods – happened off the west side of San Juan Island, in Washington state.</p><p>It could have been a coincidence. But for activists like Howard Garrett, who has worked for decades to advocate for the release of Tokitae, there was deep meaning in the meetup. “Gatherings like this are often a cultural social ritual to mark a significant event in their community, and we believe they are welcoming Toki home,” he wrote on the Orca Network Facebook group. “She is finally home, maybe not the way we wanted, but her family seems to know she is with them once again, in ways we may never comprehend.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/20/toki-death-activists-mourn-orca">Continue reading...</a>

## Hozier: Unreal Unearth review – turning the emotion up to 11

<p>(Island)<br />The Irish singer-songwriter draws on some classic literary sources for his entrancing but overlong third album</p><p>Irish singer-songwriter Andrew Hozier-Byrne’s <a href="https://hozier.lnk.to/unrealunearth">third album</a><em> </em>is a <em>lot</em>. A teetering stack of soul and rock teeming with furrow-browed, denim-jacketed, glass-cased emotion. It should come with a reading list – its 16 songs are patterned by way of Dante’s <em>Inferno</em> and he has said that epic poetry such as <em>Metamorphoses</em> inspired him. There’s a great album hiding in here but, like Ovid, <a href="https://hozier.com/">Hozier</a> lacks concision. De Selby (Part 1) – named after a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/flannobrien">Flann O’Brien</a> character – is entrancing, Hozier’s magnificent gale-force voice dialled down to a warming breeze. But what do couplets such as: “Your reflection can’t offer a word / To the bliss of not knowing yourself” mean?</p><p>Strengths lie in Eat Your Young’s supple funk, a light-footed take on Jonathan Swift’s <em>A Modest Proposal</em>, and the itchy urgency of De Selby (Part 2). There’s a chilling, unforgettable beauty to closing pair Unknown/Nth and First Light. Damage Gets Done has a nice swing to it; All Things End is solidly soulful. The album’s middle, though, sags with gusty, tension-free music, the lyrics gesturing at profundity yet too self-consciously poetic to deliver real poetry. It’s a shame there wasn’t room for Swan Upon Leda, 2022’s thoughtful single about putrid patriarchy in our post-<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/roe-v-wade">Roe v Wade</a> era.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/20/hozier-unreal-unearth-review-turning-the-emotion-up-to-11">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Usher Hall, Edinburgh<br /></strong>The Russian pianist’s Chopin lacked its heart-on-sleeve Romanticism but he brought luminosity and lightness to a technically demanding programme</p><p>Given it was the Polish-Russian war of 1830-31 that forced Chopin to flee his native Warsaw (never to return), it seemed symbolic in the light of the current war for the Russian pianist Mikhail Pletnev to be giving an all-Chopin recital at this year’s Edinburgh international festival, part of festival director Nicola Benedetti’s “<a href="https://www.eif.co.uk/profile/hope-in-the-face-of-adversity">Hope in the face of adversity</a>” strand.</p><p>Pletnev, making his first UK performance in over six years, is undoubtedly an echt virtuoso and brought an impressive lightness to the quietest passages of this technically demanding programme. But there was little here of the heart-on-sleeve Romanticism or emotional struggle for which Chopin’s music is so loved. Instead, Pletnev delivered his programme with the cold detachedness that has come to be accepted as part of his stage presence.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/edinburgh-festival-2023+tone/reviews">All our Edinburgh festival reviews</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/20/mikhail-pletnev-review-usher-hall-eif-chilly-chopin-from-introspective-russian-virtuoso">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The French star of Blue Is the Warmest Colour and new film Passages talks sex scenes, avoiding Hollywood and eating Toblerones in Jane Birkin’s bath</p><p>For Adèle Exarchopoulos, her first taste of film stardom was the literal taste of Toblerone. Then 13 years old, the young Parisian had just been cast in her first film, Jane Birkin’s autobiographical directing debut <em>Boxes</em>, and was invited round to the icon’s home. “I went to the bathroom to wash my hands,” Exarchopoulos recalls. “And I saw for the first time in my life a claw-foot tub. With a bowl of mini Toblerones next to it. And I was like: ‘Why are you eating chocolate when you’re taking a bath? This is so cool.’ And Jane said: ‘You want to sleep over? You can take a bath and eat some chocolate.’”</p><p>She beams at the memory. We’re talking, via Zoom, days after Birkin <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jul/16/jane-birkin-obituary">died aged 76</a>; Exarchopoulos remembers her fondly as “the first person who gave me a chance – really benevolent, kind and loving”. They’d seen each other again over the years, but the close-quarters shoot is what sticks in her mind: “Cinema is about living really intense stuff with people, for a certain period of time, and afterwards you all go back to your daily lives. It’s like a mini death after, suddenly no longer sharing that intimacy, but you have this kind of forever tenderness for those people. Film shoots are like little summer love stories.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/20/adele-exarchopoulos-actor-passages-interview-whishaw-blue-warmest-colour">Continue reading...</a>

It’s not even green; it’s yellow or brown, or yellow with brown spots. It’s my third summer and it has all gone wrong.

Any flowers that predated – and survived – my arrival have fallen over and are lolling on the ground.

That’s it for me and tomatoes: I can’t go through that again. Every time I go outside, something else has died.

<p>The Labour MP tells her rich personal and political story with galvanising confidence – and candour about the treatment of powerful black women</p><p>Two years ago, the Labour MP Dawn Butler got herself temporarily thrown out of parliament for calling Boris Johnson a liar. She knew that longstanding parliamentary rules forbid the use of personal insults in the chamber, but did it anyway because she felt the rules were archaic and needed to be broken. The whole thing could have been seen as grandstanding, given it achieved nothing much in practice (Johnson’s resignation was ultimately only triggered by the old-fashioned due process of a parliamentary inquiry into his conduct). But it wasn’t until I read her new memoir, <em>A Purposeful Life</em>, that I understood properly why she did it.</p><p>Dawn Butler was eight years old when she was first called a liar by her teacher in front of her whole class, for telling a (true) story about something she saw on a trip to visit relatives in Jamaica. When she became only the third black woman elected to parliament, and described being mistaken at Westminster for a cleaner, she was called a liar once again; it happened again when she complained publicly about a Met police stop on the car she was travelling in, though this time she had taken the precaution of recording it on her phone.</p><p><em>A Purposeful Life</em> by Dawn Butler is published by Torva (£18.99).

<p>From Santorini to Thessaloniki, cutting-edge modern wines are capturing the imagination of the world’s sommeliers</p><p>When Yiannis Paraskevopoulos first arrived on the island of Santorini to explore its wine scene, he didn’t like what he tasted. As he told me during a tasting at his beachfront wine bar-cum-winery, back then, in 1989, “the wines were shitty”: roughly acidic, rustic, oxidised. “What are we doing here?“, he asked the man who had brought him there, his mentor and employer at the time, Yiannis Boutaris.</p><p>Boutaris, one of the key figures in modern Greek wine, didn’t disagree. Despite the island’s 34 centuries of winemaking, the wines themselves were indeed pretty bad, he said. Nevertheless, Boutaris was convinced Santorini was a “paradise for wine”. It was just a matter of time before it took its place on the world stage. “Have patience,” he told his puzzled protege.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/aug/20/its-taken-34-centuries-but-greek-wine-is-finally-good">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘I eat to understand’: cook and writer Fuchsia Dunlop on her lifelong love of Chinese cuisine

<p>For 30 years, Fuchsia Dunlop has championed and celebrated Chinese food in the West – so much so that she now also has a loyal following in China</p><p>Fuchsia Dunlop’s new book is called <em>Invitation to a Banquet</em> and, true to her word, she has asked me to join her for just such an event: dim sum on a Monday lunchtime at the <a href="https://www.royalchinagroup.co.uk/royalchinaclub" title="">Royal China Club</a>, a Cantonese restaurant in central London. After she has a quick conference with the waiter in Mandarin, our table starts filling up: oolong tea arrives first; followed by little domed pastry puffs encasing char sui pork; and turnip cake, which is much more delicious than it sounds. Then a long strip of Barbie-pink cheung fun, stuffed with crispy seafood; a bamboo basket with elegant sui mai, one-bite pork and prawn dumplings with little pops of crab roe on top; and – eek! – a bowl of chicken feet poking out of black bean sauce. Finally, just as I’m beginning to forget what vegetables even look like, a plate of Chinese broccoli dressed in ginger arrives.</p><p>It seems unlikely that every reader of <em>Invitation to a Banquet</em> will be afforded the privilege of sitting with Dunlop and having her curate a personal, multi-course feast, but you never know. Dunlop, an English food writer in her early 50s, loves nothing more than matchmaking Western eaters with what is to them unfamiliar and sometimes intimidating Chinese food. In 30 years of exploring and documenting the country, she has done for China what Elizabeth David did for Mediterranean food and Claudia Roden did for the Middle East.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/aug/20/i-eat-to-understand-cook-and-writer-fuchsia-dunlop-on-her-lifelong-love-of-chinese-cuisine">Continue reading...</a>

## Genesis Owusu: Struggler review – an excess of creative energy

<p>(Ourness/Awal)<br />The Ghanaian-Australian rapper crosses genres to striking effect, from breakbeats and funk to addictive synth-pop</p><p>Rapper and vocalist <a href="https://www.genesisowusu.com/">Genesis Owusu</a> has made his sonic signature lurching through disparate genres. From punk-inflected spoken word to sweetly sung falsetto melodies, Prince-esque funk and thumping post-punk guitars, the Ghanaian-born Australian artist trades in an excess of creative energy. Coming to prominence with 2021’s debut <em>Smiling With No Teeth</em>, Owusu channelled the isolation and aggression of his upbringing as a Black man in majority-white Canberra through a sprawling 16 tracks of snarled rap, synth-funk and 80s rock. Largely picking up where that record left off, <em>Struggler </em>continues to convey his strife with a remarkable singularity.</p><p>Opener <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdYtpO1uXpo">Leaving the Light</a> sets the tone, with its thundering bassline and chugging drums, reminiscent of the avant-garde rap of British trio Young Fathers. A similar bass-driven rhythm continues on Freak Boy and Balthazar, but it’s when Owusu lets his melodic softness come through that he really excels. Highlights <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwobGg9q3gI">Tied Up!</a> and That’s Life (A Swamp) bounce funkily, with the latter switching into a delightfully sultry bossa riff. On What Comes Will Come, he traverses earworming synth-pop, head-nodding rap and breakbeat euphoria in under four minutes. There aren’t many artists who wear such experimentation so lightly.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/20/genesis-owusu-struggler-review-an-excess-of-creative-energy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After 30 years of helping homeless people and troubled families, the can-do peer says she’s had her fill of this Tory administration</p><p>Louise Casey, Baroness Casey of Blackstock, has lately been thinking a good deal about freezers. The thought originated with a question from King Charles, last August, when he was still Prince of Wales. The sudden spike in food prices had caused an exponential rise in demand at food banks. It also prompted the future monarch to ask Casey – who, among many other things, is a trustee of his charitable fund – what might be done.</p><p>“Freezers!” she said and scrolled down her phone for the numbers for Nisbets, the catering supplier, and for Richard Walker, the managing director of Iceland Foods. Casey had learned from talking to organisers of food banks during the pandemic that one of their biggest frustrations was a lack of refrigeration for surplus fresh and perishable goods. “Ideally,” she told Charles, “we would get a freezer into every [food bank user’s] home and pay for the electricity, but to begin with let’s do it for food banks and community kitchens.” The king’s charitable fund stumped up £1m, and 800 freezers, some on an industrial, blast-chill scale, have now been installed. The night before we met, Casey had been at a Clarence House reception with the monarch, toasting cold storage.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/aug/20/louise-casey-government-make-or-break-peoples-lives-own-amusement">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Forty years on from the magnificent album sequence that began with Swordfishtrombones, collaborators and fans including Jim Jarmusch and Thom Yorke discuss Waits’s journey from bar-room balladeer to conductor of the ultimate junkyard orchestra</p><p>On Tom Waits’s 1983 album, <em>Swordfishtrombones</em>, there is, in among a lot of fabulously unhinged musical experimentation (Tony Bennett described the record as “a guy in an ashcan sending messages”), a 90-second ballad of such tender beauty that it explains all the rest. The <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=johnsburg+illinois+wawits&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8#fpstate=ive&amp;vld=cid:d2c6167a,vid:3dCpDauzxxo">song was written for Waits’s wife</a>, Kathleen Brennan – “She’s my only true love/ She’s all that I think of, look here/In my wallet/That’s her” – and named after the town, Johnsburg, Illinois, in which Brennan grew up. The pair had got together on the set of Francis Ford Coppola’s 1981 film <em>One from the Heart</em>, for which Waits was writing the music and Brennan editing the script, and had married a couple of months later at 1am at the 24-hour Always Forever Yours Wedding Chapel in Los Angeles.</p><p>The union liberated Waits from what may have appeared his inevitable fate: of the ultimate bar-room balladeer who descends into dissolution and obscurity. The singer had spent the first decade or so of his career toying with that possibility, living partly in the Tropicana motel on Sunset Boulevard, or in his car, a 1955 Buick, writing and singing about dereliction and doomed love, and playing up to a reputation for “wasted and wounded” chaos. For the first time, having met Brennan, he said: “I now believe in happy endings.” The experimentation of <em>Swordfishtrombones</em> was the first expression of that faith. “My life was getting more settled,” Waits recalled. “I was staying out of bars. But my work was becoming more scary.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/20/tom-waits-frank-trilogy-reissues-swordfishtrombones-rain-dogs-franks-wild-years">Continue reading...</a>

Prosthetics engineer Abi (Georgina Campbell) takes a new job with fringe benefits – specifically a passive-aggressive robot butler named TIM (Eamon Farren, suitably creepy). TIM is attentive and solicitous, but the numerous cutaways to knives and waste disposal units leave us with little doubt about the threats that lurk in Abi’s perfect life.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/20/tim-review-clunky-ai-paranoia-thriller">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Terms like ‘triggered’, ‘toxic’ and ‘narcissist’ are now bandied about in daily conversations. Is this mere psychobabble or are they useful tools in a complicated world?</p><p>If the language used on the internet is a reliable indicator, we’re more psychologically enlightened than ever. We discuss attachment styles like the weather. We joke about our coping mechanisms. We project, or are projected on to. We shun “toxic” people. We catastrophise and ruminate. We diagnose, or are diagnosed: OCD, depression, anxiety, ADHD, narcissism. We make, break or struggle to “hold” boundaries. We practise self-care. We know how to spot gaslighting. We’re tuned into our emotional labour. We’re triggered. We’re processing our trauma. We’re doing the work.</p><p>The language of the therapy room has long permeated popular culture. Common terms like “repression”, “denial”, “slip of the tongue”, “hysteria” and “inner child” all lead back to Freud. But over the last decade or so, with the vast expansion of social media networks, a new, seemingly sophisticated language sits on modern society’s tongue. Some call it therapy-speak. Or psychobabble. But despite its prevalence, the language is divisive.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/aug/20/triggered-toxic-narcissist-are-you-fluent-in-therapy-speak">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Based on a bestselling novel, this tale of a middle-aged author who returns to his home town to reconnect with his romantic past is oddly insular and fussy</p><p>A celebrated middle-aged author returns, for the first time in 35 years, to his home town in the Cognac-producing region in south-western France. Stéphane (Guillaume de Tonquédec) has been asked to give a keynote speech, but his motives for accepting the invitation have more to do with reconnecting with his own romantic past. He bonds with Lucas (Victor Belmondo), a young man who, it turns out, is the son of Stéphane’s long-lost first love.</p><p>Adapted from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/06/lie-with-me-philippe-besson-review">an autobiographical novel by Philippe Besson</a> and weaving together two timelines, this is a handsome but ploddingly predictable drama. The striking wide-screen cinematography gives an impression of generous scope and openness. But in fact, like Stéphane himself, the storytelling is oddly insular and fussy.

I do my best to advise and wait to hear how it went. There is a pretty high success rate, I’m pleased to report.</p><p>In this spirit I propose a seasonal feast for my parents in Italy. My route to this menu has been via Shepherd’s Bush market in London, which is groaning with good stuff at this time of year, if you know how to shop.

Essentially, a tasty journey towards a pile of summer fruits with cream.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/aug/20/joe-trivellis-recipes-for-new-potato-salad-aubergine-polpetti-polenta-and-apricots-with-raw-cream">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Kemi Badenoch wants gender-specific lavatories in new venues, but is it wise to release more excrement into our fatally compromised sewage systems?</p><p>There are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/03/single-sex-toilets-to-be-compulsory-in-all-new-public-buildings">important questions to be asked about lavatories</a>, and Kemi Badenoch is certainly the Tory best suited to answering them. A report in the government’s <em>Daily Telegraph</em> mouthpiece announced that a new government initiative would see the equalities minister, Kemi Badenoch, appoint a Tory lavatories tsar, a task that would doubtless make her flush with pride. But the <em>Independent</em> then reported that the government had “distanced” itself from this appointment, for fear of increased bureaucracy, and also, presumably, across-the-board toilet tsar-based ridicule.</p><p>Apparently, Kemi Badenoch’s Tory lavatory tsar would have ensured that all new offices, schools, hospitals and entertainment venues have separate male and female lavatories; a big job and a massive piece of business. But our children’s generation seem largely ambivalent about gender identity, and the practical lavatorial considerations that come with it; first-wave feminists, in contrast, are understandably anxious that women’s hard-won recognitions are not, as they see it, eroded; meanwhile, some young women tell me they fear the loss of certified spaces in nightclubs and pubs for crying, vomiting up alcopops and avoiding young men; most young men, however, seem comfortable with the idea of urinating indiscriminately on the floor, while simultaneously passing wind, in any toilet, however Kemi Badenoch choses to designate the toilet’s gender.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/20/as-britain-drowns-in-filth-the-tories-want-more-toilets-kemi-badenoch-lavatory-tsar">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s surprising what you can learn in one north London Waitrose, as art curator Ingrid Swenson discovered when she began hoarding lists found in trolleys and baskets</p><p>The collection began sometime in 2014. I didn’t make a conscious decision to start it. I cannot remember the first list I picked up, other than the fact that it contained only a few items. It had been left in a basket and, in one of those clarity-of-vision moments, I instantly thought about the shopping list in a completely new way. It seemed as if someone’s entire world had frozen and been captured in a single, modest entity. This thought must have remained with me because I recall that, within a relatively short space of time, I had pocketed a few more lists. I had the sense that I was on to something.</p><p>It is astonishing how many shopping lists one can find once you start to look in earnest. To the untrained observer, they seem extremely scarce, but once you “get your eye in” you begin to see them with far greater frequency. On a few occasions I found as many as four or five in one visit. To achieve this could sometimes involve scrabbling about in the ranks of shopping trolleys stored both in the car park and large entrance area, or walking unusually slowly through the aisles fixedly focused on the floor. Nobody seemed to notice or care that there was this woman behaving in a strange way. The supermarket is a great place to behave oddly in: people just look away.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/aug/20/shopping-lists-consuming-fascination-ingrid-swenson-waitrose-holloway">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Growing out of the Lionesses’ success, the Edinburgh fringe play Pitch uses interviews gathered from LGBTQ+ grassroots football teams across the country</p><p>With muddy knees and soggy feet, we slop around Edinburgh’s Meadows park, aiming roughly for goalposts made from kitbags and spare shoes. “If that had gone in, it would have been stunning,” teases actor Eleanor Rattenbury as the ball flies way wide.</p><p>Rattenbury is one of the stars of Pitch, a show about football, and all its sorrows and joys on and off the field. Every Sunday at the fringe, the energetic cast lead post-show kickabouts on the Meadows. A winner of the Pleasance’s Charlie Hartill award, their show – staged at the Pleasance Courtyard – is based on interviews and stories that the company November Theatre gathered from LGBTQ+ grassroots football teams across the country. Written by Tatenda Shamiso and staged with dance warm-ups, lip-synced interviews and love stories, it has the fizzy feeling of stories shared with new friends over pints at the pub.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/20/pitch-the-play-about-queerness-in-the-beautiful-game-made-with-fans-and-players">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I wondered whether a bot could transform the cooking experience – so I let it plan my meals for a day</p><p>I consider myself a pretty great home cook. I like to dream up my meals, building flavors without relying on a recipe, like the lamb chops with a mustard-red wine-thyme pan sauce I recently threw together without instructions after finding the meat on sale.</p><p>So when I learned earlier this year about BuzzFeed’s new AI-powered kitchen companion, Botatouille, I was intrigued. I know it’s a controversial tool, as Botatouille’s announcement came amid widespread media layoffs – including at BuzzFeed, where the company’s CEO announced that the platform would be using AI to “enhance” its content. But the name made me chuckle, and its promise of not just offering recipes but being a companion in the kitchen was an interesting prospect.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/20/botatouille-ai-recipe-buzzfeed">Continue reading...</a>

Getting to grips with numbers in the school holidays adds up to a lesson in mental wonder for my son<p>My son has been on school holiday for a month now and is keeping himself busy with numbers. It’s his latest thing and we’re running with it. He whispers sums in my ear, separates everything he owns into sets of 4s and 5s, and asks mathematical riddles of everyone he meets.</p><p>It’s compelling to watch his brain work, to see his intuitive sense of numbers at play. Stranger, though, are the gaps. Though he can add random numbers at will, and double any number up to 50, he remains stumped by ‘7 + 9’, which he’s convinced is 15. Luckily, such missteps are easily corrected and, best of all, he receives every clarification with delight, even euphoria.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/aug/20/millions-of-numbers-plus-one-small-boy-equals-hours-of-fun">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The actor and writer on getting his grief down on the page, the five ingredients of good comedy and why the actors’ strike is sure to succeed</p><p>American comedian, actor and writer <a href="https://www.robdelaney.com/">Rob Delaney</a>, 46, weathered a bout of alcoholism and years of struggle on the standup circuit before rocketing to fame via Twitter over a decade ago. His blend of filthy wit and mordant honesty helped make the sitcom <em>Catastrophe</em><em>,</em> which he co-wrote and starred in alongside Sharon Horgan, a Bafta-winning hit. Since then, Delaney has appeared in films including <em>Deadpool 2</em> and <em>Home Sweet Home Alone</em>. He has more in the pipeline but is currently taking part in the Sag-Aftra actors’ strike. In 2018, his two-year-old son Henry died of brain cancer. Delaney’s memoir, <em>A Heart That Works</em>, strives to capture some of what the family (he and his wife have three other sons) went through during the course of Henry’s extensive treatment and in the immediate aftermath of his death. Spare, brutally poignant and at times darkly humorous in its candour, it’s ultimately a love story.</p><p><strong>Early on in the book, you confess that the urge to hurt people </strong><strong>was part of your motivation for writing it. Were you surprised by how tender it turned out to be?<br /></strong>I almost laughed near the end because I thought I was writing this big angry monster of a book, that was my goal, but the takeaway is love – and not just for Henry but for his brothers and his mum, my sister and my niece and my parents and my in-laws. I mean, my book is like a frickin’ ad for these people and how wonderful they are.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/20/rob-delaney-i-cant-help-it-swearing-makes-me-happy">Continue reading...</a>

Hoping for an England win, but I doubt if any team has suffered a four-nil loss on the way to winning a World Cup and if Spain should win, it would be an incredible achievement, especially given the trouble between players and management.

<p>Her silence is a hallmark of the serial killer, but ‘beige’ nurse did not display the usual warning signs</p><p>Tomorrow’s sentencing of Lucy Letby for the murders of seven babies and the attempted murder of six others at the Countess of Chester hospital will provide only one form of judicial ending to this harrowing case.

<p>There’s always a lot of harrumphing about loud eating, talking, arriving late, sex and even throwing things at the stage… But isn’t a bawdy audience is what a live performance is all about?</p><p>I hadn’t realised what a very, very good girl I was until I caught an unexpected reflection of myself in the window, listening to the flight attendant on the plane back from France last week. It was imperative that she saw I was paying attention. Not just paying attention, paying tribute. She must see that I was engrossed, that I was appreciative of her care, performance and sensible little mimes. Catching sight of myself like this was interesting to me, revealing as it did a part of myself I’d not yet identified: the good audience member.

## The terrible power of the state to ruin lives was exposed by the case of Andrew Malkinson | Sonia Sodha

Reversing a wrongful conviction is an almost insurmountable task<p>We like to think that our criminal justice system locks up criminals and exonerates the innocent. A comforting working assumption; but the reality is more complex. High-profile miscarriages of justice – and the years some spend wrongfully in prison – are signs that the system sometimes gets it dreadfully wrong. One way of designing out wrongful convictions is through a demanding evidentiary threshold: to convict someone, juries need to be “sure” that a <a href="https://www.bljsolicitors.co.uk/blog/understanding-the-standard-of-proof-in-criminal-cases/" title="">defendant is guilty</a>. The flipside of this is that the probably-guilty have to be allowed to walk free.</p><p>But jury deliberations are only one part of the process and are certainly not sufficient to prevent serious miscarriages of justice, as the horrific treatment of Andrew Malkinson has shown. Malkinson last month had his rape conviction overturned by the court of appeal after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/26/appeal-court-overturns-manchester-rape-conviction-of-man-who-spent-17-years-in-jail-andrew-malkinson" title="">17 years in prison</a>. His case has been plagued by serious failings at every turn. Greater Manchester police failed to disclose key evidence undermining the prosecution’s case against him to his defence team at the time of his trial, including key witnesses’ criminal convictions and important photographic evidence. This only <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/15/police-and-cps-had-key-dna-evidence-16-years-before-andrew-malkinson-cleared-of-rape" title="">came to light 15 years</a> later, as a result of extensive legal action <a href="https://appeal.org.uk/andy-malkinson" title="">by the charity Appeal</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/20/the-terrible-power-of-the-state-to-ruin-lives-was-exposed-by-the-case-of-andrew-malkinson">Continue reading...</a>

## In Trinidad, my grandmother shared with me her love of English roses

<p>In rural Somerset, I gained new understanding of gardening – and the Caribbean islands</p><p>Home. It is a word heavy with meaning. One definition refers to the place of your belonging, the place that you are from. I grew up in Trinidad and Tobago, a former British colony whose peoples have come to or been forcibly brought from many places to mix more or less uneasily on these two small land masses joined together for political expediency. I grew up in my grandmother’s and my mother’s gardens, lush spaces filled with plants brought from many places, with the backdrop of the hills of the Northern Range rising green beyond them both.</p><p>As a child, I did not know many of the stories of the people I came from. I still don’t know as much as I would like, but I have learned that, like the plants, they came from many places, places such as Portugal, China, Africa (but where in Africa is still unclear), Scotland, and Ireland, explaining my last name. The stories seemed to come from everywhere except the actual place of my birth, making the notions of home and belonging difficult to take root.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/aug/20/marchelle-farrell-a-story-of-gardening-in-trinidad-and-somerset">Continue reading...</a>

Sometimes, I said yes. Yes, it was expected. But not by me. My mother expected it. That’s not quite the right verb. She <em>planned </em>it. She planned her own death. And she told us to expect it, but I didn’t. Wasn’t I listening? Didn’t I believe her?</p><p>I misjudged her. But would you have expected it? If you had met my mother in the last years of her life, when she was in her 70s, you would have been aware of her timidity. Although she had strong opinions, she moved uncertainly through the world.

## Small boat arrivals are not a threat | Letters

The number of migrants crossing the Channel in inflatables is tiny; most people come to the UK legitimately<p>As your leader showed, the number of people arriving on small boats is minuscule in the overall immigration context (“<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/12/uk-migration-policy-small-boats-week-chaos-reveals-bankrupt-strategy" title="">‘Small boats week’ chaos reveals a bankrupt strategy</a>”). The vast majority of annual UK immigrants come here for work or study or are admitted on humanitarian schemes, such as those for Afghan, Ukrainian or Hong Kong citizens, set up and sponsored by the government itself. According to the Home Office’s own figures, small boat arrivals accounted for just 40,000 asylum claims in 2022 – fewer than half the number of people who claimed asylum in total, and negligible in comparison with the overall 600,000-plus immigration total for the year.</p><p>Government focus on small boat arrivals is a deliberately cruel and naked ploy to stir up the Tory right and distract public attention from its abject and life-threatening failures on the economy, NHS, cost of living, housing and education. It should be called out for engendering racism and xenophobia, and the figures publicly set against the far, far larger numbers of those absorbed completely uncontroversially by the UK every year.

## The Camp David summit signals a new cold war – this time with China | Observer editorial

The meeting between Joe Biden and Japan and South Korea’s heads of state symbolises a profound hardening of attitudes in the Pacific<p>If it sounds like a new cold war and looks like a new cold war, then it probably is a new cold war. For what other interpretation is to be placed on US president Joe Biden’s latest <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2023/aug/18/trump-trial-january-6-biden-summit-us-elections-live-updates" title="">ramping up</a> of diplomatic, economic and military pressure on China?</p><p>Western officials tend to avoid the term, recalling as it does decades of hair-trigger confrontation with the former Soviet Union. They talk instead about enhanced security and defence cooperation and the importance of a free and open Indo-Pacific region. But such bland generalisations belie the fact that Biden is now pushing back hard at a repressive, authoritarian regime in Beijing that he and many Americans believe is determined to overthrow the international democratic, geopolitical and legal order <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/25/new-global-order-struggles-to-take-shape-china-us-poverty-climate-migration" title="">safeguarded by the US</a>.

The reborn Empire Café in Leeds does God’s own country proud<p><strong><a href="https://www.empirecafeleeds.co.uk/">The Empire Café</a>, 6 Fish Street, Leeds LS1 6DB.</strong><strong>. Breakfast baps from £4.50, small plates £8-£12, large plates £15-£20, desserts £9, wines from £25</strong></p><p>The <a href="https://www.empirecafeleeds.co.uk/" title="">Empire Café</a> in Leeds has got a whole bunch of angles, and boy are they working them. Happily, they’re good angles, so it’s fine. The story goes like this. Yorkshire chef Sam Pullan, previously of the Bear at Carriages in Knaresborough, took a lease a couple of years back on a corner space just off Briggate in Leeds, formerly called La Strega. With his partner Nicole Deighton he planned to open a café called Appys. In 2020, when renovations began, they pulled back the Strega shopfront to discover a sweeping red and gold sign for the Empire Café, a name that almost certainly references the Empire Theatre, one of the great music halls of Leeds, which opened just a street away in 1898. Further research revealed that this corner of Fish Street had been a dining room since 1884.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/aug/20/jay-rayner-restaurant-review-the-empire-cafe-leeds-it-made-me-smile">Continue reading...</a>

Back in 1988, when the <em>Observer</em> investigated the very same question, it was a similarly mixed – if vastly more encouraging – picture across the world.</p><p>UK readers should take a deep breath before reading on. The article explained that £150,000 was ‘three times the national average house price’ (it’s currently £285,000) ‘and a third more than the average for a home in one of the central London boroughs’. With that budget, you were, regrettably, priced out of Knightsbridge and Belgravia, but ‘It is still possible to find, for example, a good one-bedroom flat in Chelsea or a three-bedroom maisonette in a modern block in Holland Park, W11.’ For reference, the average house price in Kensington and Chelsea is currently £1,275,716. You could also get a ‘47-acre deer park complete with a five-bedroom house’ or 11 unmodernised two-up, two-downs in Hull.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/aug/20/from-the-observer-archive-what-could-you-get-for-150000-pounds-in-1988">Continue reading...</a>

## Bubbling up: sparkling wine without snobbery

<p>There’s more to fizz than champagne, and it’s all a matter of style, as shown by these fine bottles of English and Italian wine</p><p><strong>Mionetto Valdobbiadene Prosecco Extra Dry, Italy NV (£14.90, <a href="https://www.goldenwines.co.uk/details/mionetto-valdobbiadene-prosecco-superiore-docg/3489">Golden Wines</a>) </strong>In the world of sparkling wine, there’s a distinct class divide. At the top, you have the aristocrats of Champagne who believe fine sparkling wine can only be achieved by the so-called méthode champenoise, in which the wine is given its second fermentation in the bottle. These nobles of fizz tend to look down, perhaps with a tinge of jealousy, on the Italian winemakers behind prosecco, who have secured enormous success with wines made using the inarguably cheaper, less labour-intensive charmat method, where the second fermentation takes place in large, pressurised tanks. I prefer to see the differences in each as a matter of style rather than quality or class: and there are times when the sherbet-frothy softness of a good prosecco, such as Mionetto’s, is exactly what I’m after.</p><p><strong>Bramble Hill Sparkling Wine, England NV (£16, <a href="https://www.marksandspencer.com/bramble-hill-sparkling-wine-of-england-case-of-6/p/wnp60573275">Marks &amp; Spencer</a>) </strong>The whole tank v bottle distinction may come across as a bit ‘narcissism of small differences’ to the casual drinker. But it matters a great deal to those involved. It’s certainly a live issue in the fast-evolving UK wine scene, for example, where the emergence of a new wave of charmat-method wines has offended the sensibilities of many representatives of the existing sparkling wine scene. The worry for the established British names, such as Nyetimber, Gusbourne and Ridgeview, is that their hard-won reputation for high-quality, Champagne-rivalling bottle-fermented fizz will be dragged down by what they see as a cheap and cheerful imitator riding on their coattails. Personally, I can’t see the problem of broadening England’s vinous offer to take in more affordable sparkling bottles – provided it’s clear on the label, so we know what we might expect when we open a soft-and-easy, English charmat fizz, such as Bramble Hill.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/aug/20/bubbling-up-sparkling-wine-without-snobbery">Continue reading...</a>

Denise Brown, the UN’s humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine, condemned it as a “heinous” attack.</p><p><strong>President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukrainian forces would give “a notable response”</strong> to the “terrorist attack”. Of the injured, 15 were children, he said. Fifteen others were police, interior minister Ihor Klymenko said. Most of the victims were in vehicles, crossing the road or returning from church, he said. The strike occurred during the Orthodox holiday of the Transfiguration of the Lord. Forty-one people were in hospital on Saturday, regional governor Viacheslav Chaus said.</p><p><strong>Training had begun for Ukrainians to operate US F-16 fighter jets</strong> but it would take at least six months and possibly longer, the Ukrainian defence minister said. Oleksiy Reznikov’s comments on Saturday came two days after a US official said F-16s would be transferred to Ukraine once its pilots were trained.</p><p><strong>Ukraine has begun discussing with Sweden the possibility of receiving Gripen jets to boost its air defences</strong>, Zelenskiy said on Saturday after meeting Swedish prime minister Ulf Kristersson. Zelenskiy cast the talks as preliminary, saying: “Today we discussed in detail the future steps regarding the possibility of opening the subject of receiving Swedish Gripens.” Zelenskiy also said that Ukrainian pilots had already begun training on the planes. Kristersson made no mention of Gripens in his remarks. The two leaders announced that the two countries agreed to strengthen cooperation on production, training and servicing of Swedish CV-90 infantry fighting vehicles.</p><p><strong>The Ukrainian air force said it shot down 15 out of 17 Russian drones</strong> targeting northern, central and western regions overnight into Saturday. Civilian infrastructure was damaged in at least two regions, authorities said.</p><p><strong>Russia’s defence ministry reported a flurry of Ukrainian drone attacks</strong> on Saturday targeting the regions of Moscow, Novgorod to the north-west of the Russian capital, and Belgorod, which borders Ukraine. The ministry said nobody was hurt. The Belgorod region, more than 600km from Moscow, is a vital stop on Russian supply lines and is frequently targeted by drones and missiles.</p><p><strong>In Russia, President Vladimir Putin visited top military officials in the city of Rostov-on-Don near the Ukrainian borde</strong>r.
