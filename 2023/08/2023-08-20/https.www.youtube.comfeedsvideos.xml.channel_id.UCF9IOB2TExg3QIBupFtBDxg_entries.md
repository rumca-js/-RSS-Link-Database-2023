FDA explicitly recognizes that doctors do have the authority to prescribe ivermectin to treat COVID

“FDA is clearly acknowledging that doctors have the authority to prescribe human ivermectin to treat COVID. 

So they are not interfering with the authority of doctors to prescribe drugs or to practice medicine,”

Three doctors

Lawsuit filed by Boyden Gray & Associates on behalf of three doctors who were disciplined for prescribing human-grade ivermectin to patients.

FDA had violated well-established law that allows doctors to prescribe an FDA-approved drug as an off-label treatment.

FDA "has unlawfully taken formal, unequivocal, and conclusory actions to prohibit or otherwise interfere with the use of ivermectin to treat COVID-19,"

The FDA "cannot advise whether or for what purpose a doctor should prescribe, or a patient should take, an approved drug," 

Ivermectin approved by FDA in 1966

Case rejected late 2022

At the appeal

What about when it said, ‘No, stop it’?” 

(Circuit Judge Jennifer Walker Elrod)

“Why isn’t that a command? If you were in English class, they would say that was a command.”

Ms. Honold described the statements as “merely quips.”

Is it horse and cow medicine?

Emergency Use Authorization of Medical Products and Related Authorities

d. No Alternatives

For FDA to issue an EUA, there must be no adequate, approved, and available alternative to the candidate product for diagnosing, preventing, or treating the disease or condition.  

A potential alternative product may be considered “unavailable” if there are insufficient supplies of the approved alternative to fully meet the emergency need.
