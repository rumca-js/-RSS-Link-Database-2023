The flooded area in the video is Wuchang County in Heilongjiang Province. It's located in the northeastern part of China and is known as the "grain warehouse in Northeast China," a region that is well known nationwide.  
Peasants have suffered great damage. Homes built by generations are destroyed, and crops are flooded with no harvest. Look, the floodwaters have inundated the rice paddies. One can only see a sea of water with the tip of the rice crops. Now itâ€™s supposed to be the flowering period. No rice will grow without flowers. In about two months it will be harvesting time, but now with the big flood, the harvest is gone.
