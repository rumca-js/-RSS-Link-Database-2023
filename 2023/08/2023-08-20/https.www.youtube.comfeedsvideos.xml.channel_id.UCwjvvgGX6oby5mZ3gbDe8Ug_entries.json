It's located in the northeastern part of China and is known as the \"grain warehouse in Northeast China,\" a region that is well known nationwide.  \nPeasants have suffered great damage. Homes built by generations are destroyed, and crops are flooded with no harvest. Look, the floodwaters have inundated the rice paddies. One can only see a sea of water with the tip of the rice crops. Now it\u2019s supposed to be the flowering period. No rice will grow without flowers. In about two months it will be harvesting time, but now with the big flood, the harvest is gone. \n\nHave questions? Do you have something to share with us about China?
