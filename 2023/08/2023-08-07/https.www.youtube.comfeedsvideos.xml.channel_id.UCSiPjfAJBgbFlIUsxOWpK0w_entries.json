This was my first time writing horn parts for a song! I don\u2019t read or transcribe music very well. So I sang all the parts and exported stems, which Vikram (the trombone player) then converted to sheet music for three horn players. \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\u00a0Sometimes my lack of theoretical musical knowledge makes me think that someone else should be in charge of composing. It\u2019s easier to trust someone with a degree in composition than to trust my own musical instincts. But I\u2019m glad that I pushed through the imposter syndrome, because writing horn parts is really fun. Also can someone please tell me WHY TROMBONES SOUND SO GOOD????", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfRO4XmVJjU", "date_published": "2023-08-07T15:00:54+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/xfRO4XmVJjU/hqdefault.jpg"}]
