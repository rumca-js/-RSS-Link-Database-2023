However, Baldur's Gate 3 from Larian Studios is so much more. It offers complex yet creative combat and excellent characters.\n\nFrom the dialogue and pacing to the customization and quest design, every aspect of Baldur's Gate 3 is honed to near perfection. The visuals are gorgeous and the soundtrack stellar, while the sheer length and breadth of the experience offer extensive replay value.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 is a must-play RPG, even with minor bugs and technical issues.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFL-LUVvMkc", "date_published": "2023-08-07T11:30:11+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/TFL-LUVvMkc/hqdefault.jpg"}]
