	A woman is going viral for her joyous response to buying groceries without money. All she had to do is scan her hand, and Amazon will send her a bill.
</p><p>
	To be clear, 
	<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/microchip-girl-tiktok" target="_blank">she hasn't been implanted with a microchip</a>. This isn't one of those globalist conspiracies (that aren't conspiracies as much as they are quoting people verbatim). Both <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/21/amazon-whole-foods-getting-palm-scanning-payment-system.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/20/business/amazon-one-payment-whole-foods/index.html" target="_blank">CNN</a> have reported on Amazon's new way to let you pay for your goods with only a   wave of your hand. To use the service called Amazone One, customers give Whole Foods (owned by Amazon) their credit or debit card information to link their palm print. Then they scan your palm print and send you a bill after you shop.</p><p>
	Okay, now get a load of this one...

</p><h3>What is this dystopian "cashless society" junk?</h3><br /><p>
	The idea of a "cashless" society is a controversial one. The Associated Press has issued a "fact" "check" claiming a video showing an elitist telling you the coming digital cashless society will be regulated and undesirable purchases will be controlled 
	<a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-world-economic-forum-cashless-society-false-cbdc-592718364311" target="_blank">is misleading and out of context</a>. They also claimed Democrats didn't want to ban gas stoves. The fact that these words are even being said out loud is the problem.
</p><p>
	Is the Left saying verbatim "We are going to use digital currency to control what you are allowed to buy?" No.

She kept those testicles in a jar on the refrigerator and is claiming that her ex refuses to give her her testicles back. </p><p>Brianna Kingsley, <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/oakland-county/2023/08/04/transgender-woman-files-court-claim-demanding-testicles-back-from-ex/70532200007/" target="_blank">per the Detroit News</a>, filed an affidavit against her ex-boyfriend William that claiming he, and I quote, "retains possession of my surgically extracted <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/trans-woman-tsa-testicles" target="_blank">testicles</a>, preserved in (a) Mason jar, kept in (the) fridge next to the eggs." Unclear is if by eggs Brianna means from the supermarket or someone's ovum. I'll be honest, I'm doing my best not to ask questions and just let this story happen.</p><p>SHE demands the return of HER "human remains specimen." Also, $6500 cash. You know, what with pain and suffering and all that jazz. <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: I saw Human Remains Specimen open for The Misfits in 1998.</em></p><p>Brianna appeared to have featured her now detached testicles in a TikTok video entitled "The Unboxing of Dees Nuts," <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/08/07/transgender-woman-orders-ex-to-return-her-testicles/" target="_blank">according to the New York Post</a>. She removed a bag labeled " biohazard" and did a dance. Unclear is if her actual testicles were in the bag. All we know at this time is that the most offensive thing about this entire story is how Brianna would sully the sanctity of DEEZ NUTS jokes. </p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@rhinowitchsanctuary/video/7091067392507284782" class="tiktok-embed"> <section> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@rhinowitchsanctuary?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="@rhinowitchsanctuary">@rhinowitchsanctuary</a> The Unboxing of Dees Nuts<br /> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7091067396659612462?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="‚ô¨ original sound - RhinoWitchSanctuary">‚ô¨ original sound - RhinoWitchSanctuary</a> </section> </blockquote> </div><p>William, the ex-boyfriend, tells the Detroit News this incident is clear evidence Brianna has been harassing him after they split. And that -- she -- took everything she wanted when she moved out. William feels the whole thing is <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/savanah-hernandez-transwoman-dating" target="_blank">getting ridiculous</a>. "She‚Äôs been harassing me ever since we broke up. I had to take out a PPO against her."</p><p>Though when asked if he was going to keep Brianna's testicles, he would only answer with a coy, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt owe her anything."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

## Finally! The "not real" airplane freak-out lady has been identified and there's backstory behind the meltdown

She is the "that motherf*cker's not real" airplane meltdown lady. She has been identified by the <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/08/07/tiffany-gomas-ided-as-woman-behind-not-real-plane-meltdown/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=nypost" target="_blank">New York Post</a>. </p><p>And the meltdown was all about AirPods. Funny, because that is what Carrot Top said and I had no idea what he was talking about.</p><p>Gomas didn't get into a fight <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/not-real-extended-video" target="_blank">with the Lizard King or a Freemason</a>. She got into a fight with family.</p><blockquote>The argument had started when Gomas fell out with relatives she was traveling with, accusing them of stealing her AirPods, the cops said. The female then started claiming the aircraft was not safe and did not want the aircraft to leave due to her believing it would not make it to its destination.</blockquote><p>Hey, let he (or she) without sin. Amirite? We have all gotten into fights with family members while traveling. Traveling sucks. Especially air travel. You're rushing to leave. Your aunt or cousin forgets to pack your AirPods. You freak out like this: </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>
<p>Where I am overwhelmed with disappointment is with everyone else who was at Dallas-Ft. Worth International Airport that day. Because Gomas tried to get back on the plane MULTIPLE TIMES and none of you had your iPhones out? Even when the police found her outside while she was waiting for an Uber to give her criminal trespass notice, which must have been another incident because she refused to show ID or sign it. What have we been telling you about doing it for the content? </p><p>Gomas is a marketing executive, or at least was before the embarrassing incident, and according to the New York Post was named a <a href="https://media.ppai.org/ppai-magazine/2017-rising-stars-the-20-most-watchable-young-leaders/" target="_blank">2017 Rising Star</a>.

<p>The mystery has been solved. Well, mostly. Screaming "that motherf*cker is not real" at a family member over AirPods still doesn't make a lick of sense. I feel like we still need a video from her explaining what happened in detail. Tiffany Gomas owes us that much.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Grammy award-winning singer issues groveling apology one day after defending parents against Democrat gender ideology

	Yesterday, grammy award-winning R&amp;B singer NE-YO express some common sense views on parenthood, gender,  and how crazy it is that California will take your children away from you. I'm glad we never got around to writing about it because he apologizes and takes it all back.
</p><p>
	The singer appeared on VladTV and expressed what, if finding common ground was a thing, would be a common ground position. I don't care what you do as an adult. But leave kids alone. "I feel like the parents have almost forgotten what the role of a parent is. If your little boy comes up to you and says, ‚ÄòDaddy I wanna be a girl,‚Äô and you just let him rock with that?"
</p><p>
	The singer went on to question "...when did it become a good idea to let a 5-year-old, a 6-year-old, a 12-year-old make a life-changing decision for themselves? He can‚Äôt drive a car yet, but he can decide his sex?‚Äù
</p><p>
	All common sense though, which is why he also found <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/california-legalize-child-kidnapping" target="_blank">California passing a law</a> to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/california-mom-daughter-transitioned" target="_blank">take your children away from you</a> if you deny them genital mutilation surgery or permanently life-altering hormone therapy to be crazy.

<p>‚ÄúAfter much reflection, I‚Äôd like to express my deepest apologies to anyone that I may have hurt with my comments on parenting and gender identity. ... Gender identity is nuanced and I can honestly admit that I plan to better educate myself on the topic, so I can approach future conversations with more empathy.‚Äù</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="42ef6" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=34790507&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>The part about empathy was my favorite because when it comes to the Left it's "empathy for be but not for... you're a transphobe." The singer was showing empathy to parents having a government take away their right to raise their kids. He was showing empathy for adults by telling them to go be themselves. </p><p>However, when you have to be eighteen to drive a car and twenty-one to buy a beer, maybe you shouldn't be allowed to decide to cut your pee pee off when you're five. Or, AT THE VERY LEAST, be allowed to have a conversation with your five-year-old before California calls child protective services.</p><p>NE-YO had nothing to apologize for. What an embarrassing, sniveling, useless douche. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

	Yesterday, grammy award-winning R&amp;B singer NE-YO expressed common sense views on parenthood, gender,  and how crazy it is that California will take your children away from you. I'm glad we never got around to writing about it because he apologizes and takes it all back.

	The singer appeared on VladTV and expressed what, if finding common ground was a thing, would be a common ground position. He doesn't care what you do as an adult. But leave kids alone.

	The singer went on to question "...when did it become a good idea to let a 5-year-old, a 6-year-old, a 12-year-old make a life-changing decision for themselves? He can‚Äôt drive a car yet, but he can decide his sex?‚Äù
</p><p>

## Attempting to claim the Left doesn't want porn in schools, a "fact" checker accidentally admits there's porn in schools

In a dispute over a statewide ballot initiative in Ohio, a group opposing it has identified a group supporting it as "porn moms." A "fact" checker for Cleveland.com claims they can't be "porn moms" because there is no porn in schools... even though the "fact" checker's words don't back that up.</p><p>Forty-nine out of fifty states don't care about the ballot initiative and we're here to laugh at "fact" checkers, so here is the tl;dr. There is a ballot initiative to amend the state constitution. Conservatives oppose it. Leftists support it, including an organization called "Red Wine and Blue." Suburban leftist women who support whatever is the important progressive cause that week. In a mailer, a conservative group called them "porn moms," a colloquialism to describe how they support having sexually explicit books in schools that are often, and I say this in finger quotes, "banned."</p><p>We don't <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/banned-books-democrat" target="_blank">need to recap the book "banning" thing</a>. It's the same books that normie-American parents think are inappropriate in schools and that <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/banned-books-democrat" target="_blank">progressive-Americans claim are being "banned"</a> even though you can order them on Amazon and have them delivered in a few hours. </p><p>Okay, Cleveland.com, you're up:</p><blockquote>Red Wine & Blue... seeks to build support for liberal causes among suburban women in swing states, [and] publicly opposes book bans and offers access to banned books, such as Maia Kobabe‚Äôs Gender Queer: A Memoir and Juno Dawson‚Äôs This Book is Gay, according to the Red Wine & Blue website. </blockquote><p>The argument, I think, is that because RWB doesn't call themselves "porn moms" that means they are not porn moms. Being a "porn mom" would mean you support porn in schools. And that is not the case here. There is no porn in schools. There are only award-winning books.</p><p>However...</p><blockquote>Gender Queer ... has been a frequent target of those seeking to ban minors from accessing controversial books. The award-winning graphic novel ... is a memoir that <strong>includes depictions of oral sex.</strong> While there <strong>are several pages of sexually explicit material...</strong><span></span></blockquote><p>Here is one of those several pages:</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>"Sexually explicit" is an R-rated movie. Or something you would see on Skinemax. Having your mouth on someone else's weiner is porno. If I showed you that photo and didn't tell you it was an award-winning author on the LGBTQAIIP+EIEIO spectrum, you would think it came from a porn site and that people who want it in schools are weird.</p><p>It is all a matter of opinion. And if it wasn't for nitpicking over rhetoric or criticizing opinions they disagree with, "independent" "fact" checkers wouldn't have a job.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Of course: Sikh 7-11 worker who whooped on a cigarette shoplifter is now under investigation

The one that showcased a rare accurate use of the word "literally" when an employee literally whooped the ass of a cigarette shoplifter. With a stick. It took place in California (no surprise there) at a 7-11. The two employees are Sikh. And the two Sikh employees are now under investigation because this is California and The Golden State values the rights of criminals over anyone else.</p><p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/clerks-attacks-cigarette-thief-stick" target="_blank">Let's relive the source material</a>.

<p>In yet another example of criminals no longer fearing repercussions of stealing, because there aren't any, a guy walked into 7-11 and ATTEMPTED TO FILL UP A GARBAGE CAN with cigarettes. He dared the clerks to do something. The clerks, pushed too far, did.</p><p>The clerks, who have been put in this position because of California policies that allow it to happen, are now under investigation for alleged "assault."

<p>"Stockton police are now investigating the man who was beaten for robbery <strong>and the clerks for assault</strong>. When the investigation is complete it will be sent to the San Joaquin District attorney for review. Then it is<strong> going to be up to the DA to determine what charges</strong>, if any, are filed against the store clerks."</p><p>We'll which way the DA goes, but like I said... it's California. The only state worse is New York. In New York, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/feeds/Jose%20Alba" target="_blank">a bodega employee was held on murder charges for defending himself</a> when someone tried to kill him during a robbery. Charges were only dropped when the Soros-funded progressive DA was guilted into doing so. As a result, <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/08/05/jose-alba-ditching-nyc-for-dominican-republic-after-murder-charge-dropped/" target="_blank">the clerk went back to the Dominican Republic</a> where it was safer.</p><p>California policy -- and the California voters who elect California politicians to enact that policy -- is responsible for brazen theft like this <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/california-smash-grab-jewlery-store" target="_blank">being a regular occurrence</a>. Sending a message to small businesses that they just have to deal with it.</p><p>You can't keep poking people with a proverbial stick and then be surprised when they act like they're tired of being poked with a stick. In this case, it took the form of someone being whooped with an actual stick.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
