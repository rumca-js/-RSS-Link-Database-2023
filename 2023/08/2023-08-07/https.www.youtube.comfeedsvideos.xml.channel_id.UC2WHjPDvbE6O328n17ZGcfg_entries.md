Ever find yourself forgetting key details from the books you read or the coding projects you tackle? Do you wish there was a way to remember almost everything you learn? If so, you're in the right place!
In this video, I share my unorthodox, yet incredibly effective method for retaining information. It's a method I've used all my life, and it involves stepping out of your comfort zone and diving into the magic within our memories.

📖 WHAT YOU'LL DISCOVER 📖
- A fascinating story about Abraham Lincoln that exemplifies the importance of storytelling in memory retention.
- My unique approach to absorbing information through conversation and self-talk.
