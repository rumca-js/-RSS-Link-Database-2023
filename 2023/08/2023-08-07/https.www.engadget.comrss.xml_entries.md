<p>Zoom has made changes to its terms of service after online blowback over recent updates to the company’s fine print allowing AI training on customer data. A <a href="https://stackdiary.com/zoom-terms-now-allow-training-ai-on-user-content-with-no-opt-out/">report</a> from <em>StackDiary</em> over the weekend highlighted how the <a href="https://explore.zoom.us/en/terms/">changes</a>, which rolled out in March without fanfare, appeared to grant the company sweeping control over customer data for AI training purposes. In response, Zoom published a <a href="https://blog.zoom.us/zooms-term-service-ai/">blog post</a> today claiming it wouldn’t do what its terms said it could do; the company then updated its terms in response to the continued blowback. It now says it doesn’t train AI models on consumer video, audio or chats “without customer consent.”</p><p>At least part of the issue stemmed from Zoom’s experimental <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zoom-email-calendar-meetings-productivity-184822470.html">AI tools</a>, including IQ Meeting Summary (ML-powered summarizations) and IQ Team Chat Compose (AI-powered message drafting). Although account owners have to provide consent before starting a meeting using these tools, additional participants are only presented with two options: accept the terms and join the meeting, or reject them and leave the meeting.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“What raises alarm is the explicit mention of the company’s right to use this data for machine learning and artificial intelligence, including training and tuning of algorithms and models,” Alex Ivanovs wrote for <em>Stack Diary</em>. “This effectively allows Zoom to train its AI on customer content without providing an opt-out option, a decision that is likely to spark significant debate about user privacy and consent.” Ivanovs highlighted how the terms give it the right to “redistribute, publish, import, access, use, store, transmit, review, disclose, preserve, extract, modify, reproduce, share, use, display, copy, distribute, translate, transcribe, create derivative works, and process Customer Content and to perform all acts with respect to the Customer Content.”</p><p>In the company blog post published today, Zoom’s Chief Product Officer Smita Hashim stressed that account owners and administrators indeed have to provide consent before choosing to share their data for AI training, insisting it’s “used solely to improve the performance and accuracy of these AI services.” Hashim added that “even if you chose to share your data, it will not be used for training of any third-party models.” Continuing, she wrote, “We have permission to use this customer content to provide value-added services based on this content, but our customers continue to own and control their content. For example, a customer may have a webinar that they ask us to livestream on YouTube. Even if we use the customer video and audio content to livestream, they own the underlying content.”</p><p>“We will not use customer content, including education records or protected health information, to train our artificial intelligence models without your consent,” the blog post reads. A new section added to Zoom’s terms today makes it clearer: “Notwithstanding the above, Zoom will not use audio, video or chat Customer Content to train our artificial intelligence models without your consent.”</p><p>“Our goal is to enable Zoom account owners and administrators to have control over these features and decisions, and we’re here to shed light on how we do that and how that affects certain customer groups,” Hashim wrote.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/zoom-reverses-policy-that-allowed-it-to-train-ai-on-customer-data-212230598.html?src=rss

<p>Boeing has rediscovered just how hard space can be in recent months, as its ambitious Starliner program has been repeatedly sidelined by lingering technical issues.

That does not mean we have a launch date in early March,” Boeing VP and Starliner manager Mark Nappi stressed during the event, per <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=34e37b9c-8975-48da-aa39-df8bcd5badc3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CNBC&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNGUzN2I5Yy04OTc1LTQ4ZGEtYWEzOS1kZjhiY2Q1YmFkYzMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vMjAyMy8wOC8wNy9ib2VpbmctcmVzZXRzLXN0YXJsaW5lcnMtZmlyc3QtY3Jld2VkLXNwYWNlZmxpZ2h0LXRhcmdldC1mb3ItbWFyY2guaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMTczZDUxNzUtNzcwOC00ZmMyLThjZmYtZWJiZWNjNzVkODU3In0&amp;signature=AQAAAVGhQKdPqPgditEhyGnwieESMhpbSLqXr9SWOA0qx-6H&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2023%2F08%2F07%2Fboeing-resets-starliners-first-crewed-spaceflight-target-for-march.html"><em>CNBC</em></a>. “We’re now working with NASA – Commercial Crew program and [International Space Station] – and ULA on potential launch dates based on our readiness ... we’ll work throughout the next several weeks and see where we can get fit in and then then we’ll set a launch date.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Starliner has been in development for nearly fifteen years now, first being unveiled in 2010. It's Boeing's entry into the reusable crew capsule race, which is currently being dominated by SpaceX with its Dragon 2.&nbsp;</p><p>The two companies were actually awarded grants at the same time in 2014 to develop systems capable of transporting astronauts to the ISS with a contract deadline of 2017. By 2016, Boeing's first scheduled launch had already been pushed from 2017 to late 2018. By April 2018, NASA was tempering its launch expectations to between 2019 and 2020.</p><p>The first uncrewed orbital test flight in late 2019 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-20-boeing-starliner-nasa-uncrewed-test-flight.html">failed to reach orbit</a>, which further delayed the project. NASA, however, did agree to pay for a second uncrewed test in August of 2021. That test never made it off the launch pad due to a "<a href="https://www.engadget.com/boeing-starliner-launch-delay-unexpected-valve-problem-165253898.html">valve issue</a>." Fixing that problem took until the following May when <a href="https://www.engadget.com/boeing-starliner-docks-with-the-iss-first-time-092700603.html">the follow-up test flight completed successfully</a>.</p><p>The two subsequent preparatory attempts for a crewed flight, did not. The scheduled July 21 flight was scrubbed after faults were discovered in both the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/boeing-starliner-parachute-test-110159702.html">parachute system</a> and wiring harnesses. Which brings us to March, which is when Boeing is confident its Starliner will successfully shuttle a pair of NASA astronauts to the ISS for a weeklong stay.  To date, Boeing is estimated to have incurred around $1.5 billion in project cost overruns.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/boeings-starliner-could-be-ready-for-crewed-flights-by-next-march-210222245.html?src=rss

## Scientists have reproduced last year's nuclear fusion breakthrough

<p>Scientists at a federally funded research center in the US have successfully conducted a second nuclear fusion reaction experiment that resulted in a net energy gain. The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) said scientists at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) generated a higher energy yield than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/first-fusion-reaction-ignition-155212785.html"><ins>in their December breakthrough</ins></a>, as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-scientists-repeat-fusion-power-breakthrough-ft-2023-08-06/"><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a> reports.</p><p>The nuclear fusion approach is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/06/us-scientists-achieve-net-energy-gain-second-time-fusion-reaction"><ins>very similar</ins></a> to the process that results in stars being able to emit light and heat. The scientists used a laser aimed at fuel to combine two light atoms into a denser one. This releases a great deal of energy. The process is said to have a lot of potential as a source of sustainable, low-carbon energy that could help combat climate change.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In the initial experiment in December, the laser delivered 2.05 megajoules to the target. The scientists achieved fusion ignition by generating 3.15 megajoules of energy output. That's a net yield of around 1.1 megajoules, which is equivalent to 0.31kWh — enough energy to power a 50-watt LED TV for six hours.</p><p>It's not yet clear exactly how much of a net energy yield was obtained from the latest successful experiment, which was carried out on July 30th. An LLNL spokesperson told <em>Reuters</em> that researchers are still analyzing the final results.</p><p>There's quite some way to go until fusion ignition becomes a viable option for mainstream energy production with the capability of powering homes. For one thing, scientists will have to scale up the system substantially. In any case, showing that it was possible to repeat the experiment and surpass the previous results is a positive step forward for clean energy.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/scientists-have-reproduced-last-years-nuclear-fusion-breakthrough-200611282.html?src=rss

<p>Microsoft wasn't subtle <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-openai-investment-expansion-152302151.html">in announcing its plans</a> to add AI functionality to any and all of its existing products.  On Monday, <a href="https://blogs.bing.com/search/august-2023/Celebrating-6-months-of-the-new-AI-powered-Bing">the company announced</a> that, in addition to its availability on the Edge mobile browser, as well as standalone Android and iOS apps, Microsoft's Bing Chat AI chatbot will now be accessible through third-party browsers like Safari and Chrome.</p><p>The news comes as part of Microsoft's six-month commemoration of Bing Chat's public availability. The company also notes that in that time, users have engaged in more than a billion conversations with the AI and have had it generate three-quarters of a billion images.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;This next step in the journey allows Bing to showcase the incredible value of summarized answers, image creation and more, to a broader array of people,&quot; the company release reads. Features like &quot;longer conversations [and] chat history&quot; remain Edge mobile exclusives, however.&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bing-chat-powered-by-openai-tech-is-rolling-out-to-chrome-and-safari-035228266.html">began opening access to Bing Chat in late July</a>, when it became available on 3rd-party desktop browsers. That version is limited as well, offering only 2,000 words per prompt on Chrome and Safari versus 4,000 on Edge.&nbsp;</p><p>Bing Chat is powered by ChatGPT-4 from OpenAI but offers more up-to-date information than the system its built on, thanks to Bing Chat's access to Bing Search, which allows it access to information on events that have happened since the model was trained. In addition to the third-party browser access, the newest version of Bing Chat will also offer multimodal search, meaning users will be able to upload a photo and have the AI answer specific questions about its contents, as well as a dark mode for after-hours AI queries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/microsofts-bing-chat-is-available-in-chrome-and-safari-mobile-191240880.html?src=rss

<p>Evo 2023 fighting game tournament attendees reported problems with damaged PlayStation 5 USB ports over the weekend. Participants took to social channels (<a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-street-fighter-6-evo-melt-sf6-usb-controller-1850712894">via</a><em>Kotaku</em>) to show and tell accounts of USB accessories that seemingly got too hot and “melted” when plugged into the event’s numerous PS5 consoles.</p><p>Current Google (and former Meta and Microsoft) AR engineer Eduardo Cuervo, who said he attended the event for the first time this year, <a href="https://twitter.com/cloudraven/status/1687861472632954880">posted</a> on X (formerly Twitter) the photo below of a controller’s USB plug that included melted pieces of the PS5’s blue port. “Mine was not the only controller that [melted] down,” he wrote. “This is just terrible. You need to do something about that lack of heat dissipation, especially if you are going to use PS5s in tournaments.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Closeup of the plug of a USB controller accessory with pieces of blue inside the part of the plug meant to be hollow." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/77a810f0-3546-11ee-bed6-83d6d93e9160" style="height: 574px; width: 958px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Eduardo Cuervo / X</div></figure><p>The incident appeared common enough that multiple users echoed his complaints. “After my [<em>Street Fighter 6</em>] set, my opponent courteously took out my cord for me and out came with it the PS5 USB receiver,” Reddit user u/SyrupyCereal <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fighters/comments/15jqrxj/comment/jv2m4bp/">posted</a>. “Broke my Junkfood cable right then and there!

Of course, competitions like Evo include highly unusual conditions that most console owners will never face, including countless systems lined up nearby with rear USB accessories (located next to the console’s exhaust vents) plugging in and out throughout the frantic weekend. In addition, some attendees speculated that people plugged in unsupported USB converters, allowing them to use incompatible controllers, which may have damaged the console ports.</p><div id="2c229d88461047bab8268513eca215ce"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">EVO is proving that PS5 is NOT the answer.

## The best fitness trackers for 2023
 - [https://www.engadget.com/best-fitness-trackers-133053484.html?src=rss](https://www.engadget.com/best-fitness-trackers-133053484.html?src=rss)

<p>The fitness tracker isn’t dead, and if you’re reading this, you’re probably one of the people keeping these little devices alive. Smartwatches like the Apple Watch and the Samsung Galaxy Watch have all but taken over the mainstream wearable space, but the humble fitness tracker remains an option for those who want a gadget to do one thing right all the time: track fitness metrics accurately, without the barrage of notifications you’d get from other wearables. Despite the headwinds, there are still a bunch of fitness bands out there to choose from. Engadget has tested many of them and picked out the best fitness trackers for most people.</p><h2>What do fitness trackers do best?</h2><p>The answer seems simple: Fitness trackers are best at monitoring exercise, be it a 10-minute walk around the block or that half marathon you’ve been diligently training for. Obviously, smartwatches can help you reach your fitness goals too, but there are some areas where fitness bands have proven to be the best buy: focus, design, battery life and price.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When I say “focus,” I’m alluding to the fact that fitness trackers are made to track activity well; anything else is extra. They often don’t have the bells and whistles that smartwatches do, which could distract from their health tracking abilities. They also tend to have fewer sensors and internal components, which keeps them smaller and lighter. Fitness trackers are also a better option for those who just want a less conspicuous device on their wrists all day.</p><p>Battery life tends to be better on fitness trackers, too. While most smartwatches last one to two days on a single charge, fitness bands offer between five and seven days of battery life  — and that’s with all-day and all-night use even with sleep tracking features enabled</p><p>When it comes to price point, there’s no competition. Most worthwhile smartwatches start at $175 to $200, but you can get a solid fitness tracker starting at $70. Yes, more expensive bands exist (and we recommend a few here), but you’ll find more options under $150 in the fitness tracker space than in the smartwatch space.</p><h2>When to get a smartwatch instead</h2><p>If you need a bit more from your wearable, you’ll likely want a smartwatch instead. There are things like on-watch apps, alerts and even more robust fitness features that smartwatches have and the best fitness trackers don’t. You can use one to control smart home appliances, set timers and reminders, check weather reports and more. Some smartwatches let you choose which apps you want to receive alerts from, and the options go beyond just call and text notifications.</p><p>But the extra fitness features are arguably the most important thing to think about when deciding between a fitness tracker and a smartwatch. The latter devices tend to be larger, giving them more space for things like GPS, barometers, onboard music storage and more. While you can find built-in GPS on select fitness trackers, it’s not common.</p><h2>Best overall: Fitbit Charge 5</h2><p></p><p><a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9GaXRiaXQtQWR2YW5jZWQtTWFuYWdlbWVudC1UcmFja2luZy1HcmFwaGl0ZS9kcC9CMDlCWFE0SE1CP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTQ2LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0YWQxYmU0MC0wYTI5LTNmMzAtODljMy1jOGYxYTkwMzRjY2YifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAei71E0j4zfPdx287RPvt48GigKc7mOx2mThInYF_KAp&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFitbit-Advanced-Management-Tracking-Graphite%2Fdp%2FB09BXQ4HMB%3F&amp;uuid=AyTHmoTHO9hud2S011912">Fitbit's Charge 5</a> has everything most people would want in a fitness tracker. First and foremost, it's not a smartwatch. That means it has a slightly lower profile on the wrist and lasts days on a single charge while tracking activity and monitoring your heart rate, step count and sleep. It also has a full-color AMOLED display — a big improvement from the smaller, grayscale screen on the previous<a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2Ftem4udG8vM0FFN0JjUj91dWlkPXUzem5XaU9abWJMQTRKMEYxMjkxMiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNGFkMWJlNDAtMGEyOS0zZjMwLTg5YzMtYzhmMWE5MDM0Y2NmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAblC85yasyJxbdI4HObQXM3htBkzOU20-aIRQVHZbngg&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Famzn.to%2F3AE7BcR%3Fuuid%3Du3znWiOZmbLA4J0F12912"> Charge 4</a>. That display, along with a thinner design, make<a href="https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-charge-5-review-130043489.html"> Charge 5</a> feel more premium than its predecessor.</p><p>The Charge 5 has EDA sensors for stress level tracking and it will eventually support ECG measurements and Daily Readiness Scores (the latter is only for Fitbit Premium subscribers). Those are on top of existing features that were carried over from the Charge 4 — most notably, Fitbit Pay support and built-in GPS tracking. The former lets you pay for coffee or groceries with a swipe of your wrist, while the latter helps map outdoor runs, bike rides and other activities. Built-in GPS remains the star of the show here — it's fast and accurate, making the Charge 5 the best option if you want a focused do-it-all wearable fitness watch.</p><h2>Runner up: Garmin Vivosmart 5</h2><p></p><p>A more subtle-looking fitness band alternative is the<a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOVZZNU5STDUvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTQ2LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0YWQxYmU0MC0wYTI5LTNmMzAtODljMy1jOGYxYTkwMzRjY2YifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAbgrmhI1VbPPxgju0cNvk4jMwo7GYfSYxIOyxg8ezSKb&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB09VY5NRL5%2F&amp;uuid=irXplmCfd2jwpFsf16915"> $150 Garmin Vivosmart 5</a>. It’s thinner than the Fitbit Charge 5 and fits in a bit better with bracelets and other jewelry you might wear regularly. But its attractive design is only part of its appeal — Garmin knows how to track fitness, and the Vivosmart 5 is proof that you don’t need to drop hundreds on one of the company’s in-depth fitness watches to get a capable device.</p><p>It has a lot of the same features as the Charge 5, except for a built-in GPS. It does support connected GPS, though, so you can map outdoor runs and bike rides as long as you bring your phone with you. The Vivosmart 5 tracks all-day heart rhythm and activity, plus sleep data and workouts, and we’ve always appreciated how many workout profiles Garmin has to choose from. You can customize which show up on your device and change them whenever you want. You’ll also get additional health and wellness information like Garmin’s Body Battery score, which tells you how long after a hard workout you’ll need to wait until you can train at peak performance again, blood oxygen levels, sleep stage data, women’s menstrual cycle monitoring and more.</p><p>The biggest disadvantages to fitness tracking with the Vivosmart 5 are the aforementioned lack of built-in GPS, plus its slightly harder to use mobile app. But on the flip side, Garmin devices can sync with Apple Health, whereas Fitbit devices still don’t have that feature.</p><h2>Best budget: Fitbit Inspire 3</h2><p></p><p>If you only have $100 to spare, the<a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwQjVGOVNaVzcvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTQ2LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0YWQxYmU0MC0wYTI5LTNmMzAtODljMy1jOGYxYTkwMzRjY2YifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAcxkW_Rzze1B6EmaU4ZQsOz4p7a-dMD9RjtZhsLP7Dph&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0B5F9SZW7%2F&amp;uuid=28j6QrwxKCXGHre820915"> Fitbit Inspire 3</a> is the best fitness tracker option. It strips out all the luxury features from the Charge 5 and keeps only the essential tracking features. You won’t get built-in GPS tracking or Fitbit Pay or Spotify control but you do get excellent activity tracking, automatic workout detection, smartphone alerts and plenty more. The updated version has a sleeker design and includes a color touch display and connected GPS, the latter of which lets you track pace and distance while you run or bike outside while you have your phone with you.</p><p>The Inspire 3 is definitely the more fashionable out of the two Fitbit devices on this list. Its interchangeable bands let you switch up the look and feel of your tracker whenever you want, and it’s slim enough to blend in with other jewelry you might be wearing. We were also impressed by its muti-day battery life: Fitbit promises up to 10 days on a single charge, and that checked out for us. After four days of round-the-clock use, the Inspire 3 still had 66 percent battery left to go.</p><h2>Most fashionable: Withings Move</h2><p></p><p>All of the previously mentioned fitness trackers are attractive in their own way (bonus points to those that have interchangeable bands), but they share a similar look. There aren’t many alternative designs for these devices anymore. The<a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9XaXRoaW5ncy1Nb3ZlLUFjdGl2aXR5LVRyYWNraW5nLVdhdGNoL2RwL0IwN0w2WlhYTks_cmVmXz1hc3Rfc3RvX2RwJnRoPTEmcHNjPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tNDYtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjRhZDFiZTQwLTBhMjktM2YzMC04OWMzLWM4ZjFhOTAzNGNjZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAdbfr2PcJbQMDdHv1QwsuOkGmc7GiYs6oSnZevEEc_fV&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FWithings-Move-Activity-Tracking-Watch%2Fdp%2FB07L6ZXXNK%3Fref_%3Dast_sto_dp%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1&amp;uuid=rv5M2ADuJHSFyb5524916"> $95 Withings Move watch</a> is an exception, and one of the most traditionally fashionable fitness trackers you can get. It’s an analog watch face with a couple of health monitoring features including step, calorie, distance and sleep tracking, connected GPS, auto-recognition for more than 30 workouts and a water-resistant design. But we really love it for its long battery life: it’ll last up to18 months before the coin cell needs a replacement.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-fitness-trackers-133053484.html?src=rss

## The next Call of Duty game is 'Modern Warfare III'

<p>We're not too far away from the fall, which of course means there's a new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/call-of-duty/"><ins>Call of Duty</ins></a> game on the horizon. Activision has <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1688580991420399617"><ins>confirmed</ins></a> long-standing rumors that this year's entry is <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III</em> from Sledgehammer Games. The publisher also revealed that the latest game in the rebooted series will hit PC and consoles (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-makes-its-10-year-call-of-duty-pact-with-nintendo-official-091655095.html">perhaps including Nintendo Switch</a>) on November 10th.</p><p>There aren't many other confirmed details yet beyond a teaser video. However, Activision <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-2023-modern-warfare-2-operator-carry-over-1850650919"><ins>recently implied</ins></a> that, for the first time, players will be able to carry over items like operators, weapons and bundles from one year's Call of Duty game (in this case, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dog-of-duty-makes-a-triumphant-return-in-modern-warfare-ii-173538176.html"><em><ins>Modern Warfare II</ins></em></a>) to the next. That was a pretty strong indication that the next entry would be <em>Modern Warfare III</em> and not, say, a return to a World War II setting.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="0bfd7640a5724718942dcece7a4dc4c1"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>At one point, it seemed like there wouldn't be an entirely new Call of Duty game this year. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/no-call-of-duty-main-game-in-2023-145236401.html"><ins>Reports in early 2022</ins></a> suggested that Activision would slow things down a bit and instead deliver a significant expansion for <em>Modern Warfare II</em> while continuing to update <em>Warzone </em>and working on the next mainline game. Ultimately, the publisher decided to stick with its cadence of releasing a full-price Call of Duty game every year.</p><p>In February, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-23/activision-s-call-of-duty-game-this-year-is-more-modern-warfare?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a> reported that <em>Modern Warfare III </em>was set to include maps and modes from last year's game while still feeling like a standalone full-price title. We'll learn just how Activision is making the transition into <em>Modern Warfare III </em>as it reveals more details in the coming weeks and months.</p><p>Meanwhile, it's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-puts-internal-trial-over-microsoft-activision-deal-on-hold-230513417.html">looking increasingly likely</a> that Microsoft will close its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-eu-approves-microsofts-687-billion-activision-blizzard-takeover-160319415.html"><ins>pending $68.7 billion acquisition</ins></a> of Activision Blizzard very soon.

## The original ‘Red Dead Redemption’ is coming to PS4 and Switch

<p>After years of speculation, <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> is set to <a href="https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/1688552977508806656">launch on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.</a> This is the original 2010 release, and not the long-rumored remaster. The western-themed third-person shooter goes on sale August 17th, just three days after revered lawman and huckleberry spokesperson <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Holliday"><ins>Doc Holliday’s birthday.</ins></a></p><p>This is the digital version, but a physical release follows on October 13th. Though this is a straight port, the release does include the <em>Undead Nightmare </em>DLC, the zombie campaign that was added to the Game of the Year edition back in the day. The combo pack costs $50, which seems like a lot for a straight port of a 13-year-old game that hasn’t been updated to allow for 4K visuals or a faster framerate. Also, the ports won’t support multiplayer.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As for the potential next-gen refresh, it looks to be dead in the water. <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-iv-remastered-red-dead-redemption-canceled-rockstar-1849142371"><em><ins>Kotaku</ins></em><ins> reports</ins></a> that Rockstar has shelved the project after the debacle surrounding the subpar performance of the <em>GTA Trilogy</em> remake, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gta-trilogy-patch-remaster-rockstar-games-195157534.html"><ins>which was an absolute buggy mess.</ins></a> The company is focusing on new titles, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rockstar-grand-theft-auto-6-leak-155755703.html"><ins>like the forthcoming </ins><em><ins>GTA VI</ins></em><ins>,</ins></a> instead of remakes.</p><div id="39ff366d91ed4f36ab18f14c9336965b"></div><p>For the uninitiated, the original <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> is both a spiritual successor to an older game called <em>Red Dead Revolver,</em> but actually takes place after the events of <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>. It follows former outlaw John Marston as he rounds up some of the gang members that take center stage in the sequel. It’s still a sprawling open-world adventure game, like <em>RDR2,</em> but with a more focused narrative and structure. There’s no swimming, which is a bummer, but you can still tie people to train tracks, which is the opposite of a bummer.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-original-red-dead-redemption-is-coming-to-ps4-and-switch-165058354.html?src=rss

The indie publisher's inaugural Devolver Delayed showcase delivered on its promise, featuring five games whose release windows have been pushed out of 2023 and into 2024. Which, of course, kind of means Devolver was lying when it initially announced these games, but let's <em>live in the now</em>.</p><p>So, here's the list of Devolver games that are now due out next year, minus the maniacal corporate joy that underpinned the actual showcase: <em>Skate Story</em>, <em>The Plucky Squire</em>, <em>Stick it to the Stickman</em>, <em>Anger Foot</em> and <em>Pepper Grinder</em>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Skate Story</em> is the hardest delay to swallow, personally speaking. Developed by Sam Eng, <em>Skate Story</em> is a highly stylized skateboarding game set in a dark, neon-streaked hellscape and starring a demon made of glass. It looks trippy and fast-paced, and I was very much looking forward to playing it this year. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1263240/Skate_Story/"><em>Skate Story</em></a> is now coming to PC in 2024 and it's available to wishlist on Steam.</p><div id="fee2f37191544f318e9c2c602b73c0b2"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p><em>Stick it to the Stickman</em> and <em>Anger Foot</em> are both products of Free Lives, the studio behind <em>Broforce</em>, <em>Gorn </em>and <em>Genital Jousting</em>, and a longtime Devolver partner. Both <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2085540/Stick_It_to_the_Stickman/"><em>Stickman</em></a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1978590/Anger_Foot/"><em>Anger Foot</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>are coming to PC next year and are available to wishlist right now.</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1627570/The_Plucky_Squire/"><em>The Plucky Squire</em></a> looks to be an extraordinarily cute platforming adventure that swaps between 2D and 3D visuals. This one comes from All Possible Futures and it's heading to PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch (in 2024, of course). Last on the delay list, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2076580/Pepper_Grinder/"><em>Pepper Grinder</em></a> is a 2D platformer featuring a character with a big drill, and it's being developed by Oregon-based studio Ahr Ech for PC and Switch.</p><p>The Devolver Delayed showcase also provided some relief, in the end. A handful of the publisher's games have decidedly <em>not </em>been delayed and are still targeting 2023 release windows, including <em>Gunbrella</em>, <em>Wizard with a Gun</em>, <em>KarmaZoo</em>, <em>The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood</em> and — most notably, in my book — <em>The Talos Principle II</em>. A sequel to the 2014 award-winning game from Croteam, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/835960/The_Talos_Principle_2/"><em>The Talos Principle II</em></a> promises more first-person laser-based puzzles, philosophical pontification and existential dread, and it's all still coming out in 2023 for PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p><p><em>The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood</em> is actually due out on August 16, just over one week from today. It's the latest game from Deconstructeam, the Spanish studio behind <em>Gods Will Be Watching</em> and <em>The Red Strings Club</em>, and the preview had me happily <a href="https://www.engadget.com/build-tarot-decks-and-seduce-a-god-in-the-cosmic-wheel-sisterhood-150023513.html">building tarot decks and flirting with immortal beings</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/skate-story-and-four-other-devolver-games-have-been-delayed-to-2024-162331587.html?src=rss

## Google Search now has an AI-powered grammar checker

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google/"><ins>Google</ins></a> is taking aim at the likes of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/grammarly/"><ins>Grammarly</ins></a> with a feature it added to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google-search/"><ins>Search</ins></a> recently. The service <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/13420782"><ins>now includes</ins></a> a grammar checker, which can analyze the construction of a phrase or sentence and offer suggestions if it something seems off.</p><p>Punching in a phrase like “grammar check,” “check grammar” or “grammar checker” will make sure the tool activates, as <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/08/06/google-search-grammar-check/"><em><ins>9to5 Google</ins></em></a> points out. But Search might still offer grammar suggestions if you don’t include one of those phrases with your query.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If the tool notices an error, including a spelling mistake, Google will rewrite the sentence and indicate what’s different. You’ll easily be able to copy the corrected phrase or sentence by hovering over it. If your grammar is spot on, the tool will give you a dopamine-inducing green checkmark, but not, sadly, a gold star.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the tool is powered by artificial intelligence. It might not always be accurate, especially if you ask it to review a phrase or fragment instead of an entire sentence. If you spot something wrong with a suggestion (or want to help the system understand that its correction was helpful), you can provide feedback.</p><p>The tool will only be available in English for the time being, but it's worth noting that it won't run if the phrase or sentence violates Search policies. It won't check the grammar for dangerous, harassing, medical, sexually explicit or terrorist content, or anything to do with violence and gore. You might have to look elsewhere to make sure that a phrase or sentence containing profanity or vulgar language is grammatically correct too.</p><p>Google has, of course, offered grammar tools in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-21-gmail-spelling-autocorrect.html"><ins>Gmail</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-24-google-docs-ai-grammar-checking.html"><ins>Google Drive</ins></a> for a long time now. Bringing one to Search makes a lot of sense, given that it has a dictionary tool in its extensive bag of tricks. It'll save you having to open Google Docs or another app. You won't necessarily have to bust out a dusty copy of <em>The Elements of Style </em>either.</p><p>However, many people just focus on the keywords when they search for something on Google and don't write complete sentences or grammatically correct phrases (e.g. &quot;hard boiled egg how long&quot;). The AI will have to make an educated guess as to whether someone wants their grammar to be checked or not. Otherwise, Search could push the information they're looking for even further down the page.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-search-now-has-an-ai-powered-grammar-checker-144539934.html?src=rss

<p>After a ransomware attack in June, the Colorado Department of Higher Education (CDHE) <a href="https://cdhe.colorado.gov/news-article/colorado-department-of-higher-education-provides-notice-of-data-incident">notified students on Friday</a> of a potential data leak. In June, &quot;unauthorized actor(s)&quot; not yet publicly identified accessed CDHE systems in a ransomware attack. While authorities continue to investigate the full extent of the damage, the department has disclosed that the attack breached personally identifiable information like names and social security numbers.</p><p>&quot;The review of the impacted records is ongoing and once complete, CDHE will be notifying individuals who are potentially impacted by mail or email to the extent we have contact information,&quot; CDHE wrote in a <a href="https://cdhe.colorado.gov/notice-of-data-incident">Notice of Data Incident</a>. But the department warns students that the impact of the breach reaches across programs, from public schools to adult education initiatives, over a 16 year time period.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In response, CDHE is offering free access to Experian credit monitoring and identity theft protection to protect their data. The department recommends impacted groups keep an eye on their account statements and credit reports for suspicious activity.&nbsp;</p><p>Education systems are a popular target for ransomware attacks. In 2022, at least 44 colleges and 45 school districts reported ransomware attacks, compared to 88 total education departments in 2021, according to <a href="https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/ransomware-schools-steady-rate-2022/639610/">data from Emsisoft</a>.

Compared to similarly-priced streamers from Roku and Google, Amazon's Fire OS is generally more aggressive about displaying ads on the home screen and nudging you toward the company's own services throughout the UI. You'll get the most out of it if you already use services like Prime Video on a regular basis.

The extra screen space will definitely come in handy in a lot of different workflows, and since the 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly as thin and light as the 13-inch model, it's remains quite portable.</p><p>The biggest gripe with the 15-inch Air that we should call out, especially now, is that Apple's M2 chipset is one year old at this point and there's a possibility that we see <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-first-m3-macs-could-arrive-in-october-163204526.html">new, M3-powered Macs</a> debut this fall.

## WhatsApp's latest feature lets you jump in and out of group voice chats

<p>Last year, WhatsApp released a series of new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-voice-messages-draft-recordings-speed-up-playback-150034778.html">updates to make sending voice messages</a> an overall better experience, and now it's bringing the whole group in on it. The messaging app has released a beta version of voice chats — a feature that creates an ongoing group audio conversation, <a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-23-16-19-whats-new/">reports <em>WABetaInfo</em></a>. The first sign of voice chats came earlier this year under the name audio chats but didn't provide much other info than its mere existence.</p><figure><img alt="Two WhatsApp chats show how to open a voice chat.

Anyone with the update should see a waveform symbol in the upper right corner of their group chat. Pressing the icon starts a group voice chat and will say voice chat opened with a microphone to its left and a red X to its right. Everyone else in the group will receive a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-lets-you-save-disappearing-messages-152448993.html">push notification</a>, the same as any message, instead of their phone ringing. They will see a banner at the top of the chat box letting them know how many people are chatting now and giving them the option to connect.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Voice chats are protected by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whats-app-end-to-end-encryption-for-backups-150954934.html">end-to-end encryption</a> just like any other messages sent and also shut off if no one has been active in it for an hour. WhatsApp voice chat only appears to be available in beta for Android users right now but will allegedly appear for more people in the coming days.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/whatsapps-latest-feature-lets-you-jump-in-and-out-of-group-voice-chats-121045597.html?src=rss

## The Morning After: Motorola’s new Razr is not a good phone

<p>It’s wild to me that a phone costing north of a grand is somehow midrange, but that’s the mad, mad world of foldables. The Morning After’s own Mat Smith reviewed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/motorola-razr-2023-review-a-midrange-foldable-that-underwhelms-190025514.html">Motorola’s new 2023 Razr</a>, a lower-end device below the flagship Razr+, and found it wanting in so many ways. Performance isn’t great, the cameras are poor and the cover display is so small it’s unusable.</p><p>In the UK, this handset is retailing for around $1,025, and while currency conversions aren’t an exact science (well…) that figure is officially Too Much for Smith’s wallet. He says that, when the handset arrives in the US, if it isn’t priced under $800, then don’t even think about it. And, even if it is, is the joy of a folding display really worth the underwhelming package that surrounds it?</p><p>– Dan Cooper</p><p><em>You can get these reports delivered daily, direct to your inbox. </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em>Subscribe right here!</em></a>​​​​</p><h3>The biggest stories you might have missed</h3><h3></h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/federal-judge-narrows-scope-of-antitrust-case-against-google-ahead-of-trial-202837725.html">Federal judge narrows scope of antitrust case against Google ahead of trial</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/devolver-digital-will-proudly-delay-a-bunch-of-games-in-its-next-showcase-194526991.html">Devolver Digital will proudly delay a bunch of games in its next showcase </a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtubes-enhanced-1080p-playback-option-is-rolling-out-to-premium-users-on-the-web-130058566.html">YouTube's enhanced 1080p playback option is rolling out to Premium users on the web</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/threads-is-getting-a-web-version-and-a-search-function-in-the-next-few-weeks-101220107.html">Threads is getting a web version and a search function 'in the next few weeks'</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/fda-approves-first-oral-postpartum-depression-pill-063216439.html">FDA approves first oral postpartum depression pill</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/coinbase-wants-its-sec-lawsuit-dismissed-arguing-it-doesnt-deal-in-securities-170056685.html">Coinbase wants its SEC lawsuit dismissed, arguing it doesn't deal in securities </a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/gamestops-nft-wallet-will-shut-down-in-november-164252057.html">GameStop’s NFT wallet will shut down in November</a></p><h2></h2><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/call-of-duty-is-publicly-shaming-cheaters-in-the-kill-feed-154544553.html">Call of Duty is publicly shaming cheaters in the kill feed</a></h2><h3>If you’re caught using exploits, you will be named and shamed.</h3><p></p><p>I’m no fan of a culture too quick to name and shame – we’re all running the same race but carrying baggage of varying weights upon our backs.
