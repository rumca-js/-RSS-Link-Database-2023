Thank you for joining us as we journey through the great book of Exodus. We recorded 16 episodes, plus a finale, over two ten-day sessions, one in 2022 and one in 2023, releasing them initially on the DailyWire+ platform. After some careful deliberation, the DW+ executive team and Dr. Peterson decided to make them available to everyone on YouTube. We will therefore release one per week for 17 weeks, each Monday, and then keep them all there for a few weeks, before returning to the paywalled system (although episode 1 will remain permanently available).

Often, our freedom of choice keeps us from claiming the freedom God offers. As the round table in Exodus chapters seven through nine discuss, Pharaoh's refusal to let the Israelites leave is at the center of the conversation. Power, the desire to change, and the significance of the plagues are also discussed.

Thank you very much to all the participants: Dr. Os Guiness, Dr. Douglas Hedley, Dr. James Orr, Dr. Larry Arnn, Gregg Hurwitz, Ben Shapiro, Dr. Dennis Prager, Dr. Stephen Blackwood, Jonathan Pageau, and Dr. Jordan B. Peterson.

And thank you very much to the DailyWire+ crew for having the vision and generosity of spirit to make this Exodus seminar freely available to all who are interested. Perhaps you might consider a DailyWire+ subscription; it's a bastion of free speech. We have great content there with much more to come. Click here to learn more: https://bit.ly/3Q0lXj7
