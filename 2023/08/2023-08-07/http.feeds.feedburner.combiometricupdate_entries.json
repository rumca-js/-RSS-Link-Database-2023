NIST called for feedback on its proposed new track for the Face Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT).\n\nRights advocacy groups Human Rights Watch and 5Rights Foundation are among those submitting comments, with <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/08/04/human-rights-watch-and-5rights-foundation-submission-us-national-institute\">a letter</a> addressed to Grother and two other prominent NIST scientists. They argue that NIST should calculate accuracy \u201cin discrete years,\u201d with 18 as a boundary due to its common acceptance as the age of majority in most States. They say the use of groupings in a previous report hinders the assessment of algorithm performance.\n\nNIST should also add an indicator for the direction of error, so that the mean error rate, which NIST intends to include, would also indicate whether the algorithm\u2019s mean error judges children as older or younger than their real age.\n\nThe groups also ask that NIST disclose information about its testing datasets to \u201corganizations and researchers\u201d that work on children\u2019s and human rights.\n\nCompared to a <a href=\"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2014/NIST.IR.7995.pdf\">report NIST produced</a> on age estimation in 2014, the agency plans to employ larger, more diverse datasets with \u201cmore demographic dependencies,\u201d reporting for API functions, and enhanced visualizations of the results, according to Grother.\n\nHe expressed appreciation for the comments, which he says overall \u201cwere highly positive and constructive, went into considerable detail spanning API functionality, analysis and statistics, terminology, use-cases and relevance, and datasets.\u201d\n\n<a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/paravision\">Paravision</a>, which sells facial age estimation software, is pleased to see NIST engaging with the subject, Chief Product Officer Joey Pritikin tells <em>Biometric Update</em> in an email.\n\n\u201cAge verification is rapidly emerging as a key use case within the broader digital identity umbrella, both in response to the need for safe delivery of historically age-gated goods and services as well as in response to and anticipation of a growing number of regulations to protect children in cyberspace,\u201d Pritikin writes. \u201cAnd within age verification, automated age estimation will be a critical tool alongside face matching, identity document reading, and liveness detection. We expect NIST\u2019s participation will support an environment of transparency, vendor accountability, and stakeholder empowerment, which is what many are striving for with AI broadly and any identity-centric application more specifically.\u201d\n\nAge estimation and age verification have become hot topics in recent months, with new laws and deployments both <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/battle-over-age-verification-heats-up-in-increasingly-censorious-us\">in the U.S</a>. and <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/retail-face-biometrics-devices-roll-out-in-germany-for-age-checks-china-for-payments\">abroad</a>.\n\nNIST intends to release an update of the evaluation plan on August 15, with first results expected in late-2023.", "link": "https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/rights-groups-weigh-in-on-nists-evaluation-metrics-for-facial-age-estimation", "date_published": "2023-08-07T22:22:33+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/biometricupdate", "title": "Rwanda\u2019s planned digital ID could both increase and decrease exclusion", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://d1sr9z1pdl3mb7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/28130003/tablet-digital-identity-open-banking-scaled.jpg\" width=\"2048\" />\n\t\tSome digital ID project researchers say the plan by Rwanda to implement a biometric digital ID card in the next few years could bring huge benefits for the country\u2019s digital economy, but the risks and challenges in implementing the project must be meticulously studied and taken care of.\n\nThe experts were speaking recently on an episode of <a href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy9kOWYwOGJjYy9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw/episode/N2I5ZWQyMzktOWQ1Ny00MzRmLWI5YmEtNTI3NjkxNzk0YjJl?sa=X&amp;ved=0CAUQkfYCahcKEwiI99uT1cqAAxUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAg\">a podcast</a> called. \u201cThe Africa Hour,\u201d a production of the Africa Policy Research Institute (APRI) dedicated to discussing policy issues in different African countries. The podcast examined the successes and challenges of Rwanda\u2019s digital ID project.\n\nRwanda recently okayed legislative amendments to introduce a digital ID ecosystem, and also to <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202304/rwanda-initiates-legislative-digital-id-amendment-to-include-stateless-persons-children\">expand the scope of persons eligible for digital IDs</a> in the country which would include children and stateless persons.\n<h2>Benefits and opportunities</h2>\nHilda Barasa, a senior policy advisor with the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, who researches on digital ID issues in Africa, welcomes Rwanda\u2019s plan, saying \u201cdigital identity is something that underpins a country\u2019s digital public infrastructure.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy and large, it is considered a key enabler of the digital economy. If you have a digital ID, you are able to access improved public services because the government will have a deeper understanding of the needs of the citizens. It can also help build a stronger and more inclusive digital economy,\u201d she says.\n\nBarasa adds that a recent study carried out in four countries including Rwanda showed that digital identity has the potential to improve how Rwandans in rural communities can seamlessly access certain public services such as registration for medical insurance using digital ID.\n\nShe explains that the purpose of the research was to plug the gap that existed in terms of quantifying the benefits of integrating digital IDs to routine day-to-day activities of citizens of the countries concerned.\n\n\u201cWe got surprising results. Of all the four use cases we looked at, using digital ID to register for medical insurance came out strongest. It showed people could save up to 2.2 percent of their monthly income for medical insurance if they are able to use a digital ID for that purpose,\u201d said Barasa.\n\n\u201cIn some of the more remote villages that we went to, we realized that medical insurance centers are located about four hours way, and people of vulnerable groups have to walk that distance. Using a digital ID system to do all of this will bring multi-millions dollar benefits and saving to individuals.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am really excited to see Rwanda committing to digital identity. The government\u2019s objective of building this digital ID ecosystem to enable citizens use smart ID cards to access services, is definitely the right way to go,\u201d she contends in the podcast.\n<h2>Risks, challenges to watch out for</h2>\nThe benefits notwithstanding, there are a number of issues authorities must watch out for when implementing government-led digital ID programs at scale, says Katelyn Cioffi, senior research scholar at NYU's Center for Human Rights and Global Justice.\n\nCioffi says research done by her teams on digital ID projects shows that governments \u201calways struggle with problems of exclusion which can take on a lot of different forms.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are often groups or individuals who end up excluded entirely from the digital ID system because they are simply unbale, or in some cases, unwilling to register,\u201d says Cioffi.\n\nShe adds: \u201ceven if someone has been enrolled, they may be enrolled in adverse times which leaves them vulnerable to further exclusion and discrimination. As an example, there could be errors in their data or they might have biometrics such as fingerprints which are difficult to read. This makes different stages of verification and authentication more difficult for them. In this case, they are actually part of the system, but it is very difficult for them to enjoy the benefits.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further on the risks, Cioffi notes: \u201cDigital ID systems have databases which can be weaponized as tools by both governments and the private sector to exclude, to surveil and to exert control over different groups. Our work focusses more on the rights of those who are vulnerable when such systems are deployed such as poor people, and ethnic minorities.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe big problems with digital ID often arise when they are integrated into essential services such as health care, social protection, and other forms of government services where the harmful effects of initial exclusion can quickly multiply. In Uganda where we carried out research, millions of people are still locked out of the digital ID system.\u201d\n\nSeasoned Rwandan Journalist Hudson Kuteesa, who has reported in the past about the planned ID project, shared his thoughts on how he thinks it will be of benefit to Rwandans.\n\nAs a reporter on the ground with daily newspaper The Times, Kuteesa also mentions some of the guarantees the government in Kigali has been giving to citizens about its approach in making the new digital ID project work for all categories of people.\n\nThe pros and cons notwithstanding, the panellists are unanimous that the opportunity cost of not having a digital ID far outweighs the risks, and that those implementing such systems must put in place the right guardrails at all possible levels.", "link": "https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/rwandas-planned-digital-id-could-both-increase-and-decrease-exclusion", "date_published": "2023-08-07T22:09:32+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/biometricupdate", "title": "Missing persons NGO alliance kicks off global facial recognition initiative", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"1164\" src=\"https://d1sr9z1pdl3mb7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/07171052/Google-Photos-album-created-by-SOSDesaparecidos.png\" width=\"1309\" />\n\t\tA new alliance of non-profit organizations dedicated to finding missing persons is planning an innovative use of facial recognition to find people across Europe and Latin America.\n\nThe International Network of Associations of Disappeared Persons (<a href=\"https://riapd.org/\">RIAPD</a>) wants to create a network of global volunteers who would cross-check a database of missing persons with images stored on their smartphones.\n\nAccording to RIAPD, citizens who want to involve themselves in the search will join a Google Photos album containing images of disappeared persons. They can then use the facial recognition system natively installed on their smartphones to detect if a missing person happens to appear in their photo albums.\n\nThe RIAPD alliance was launched in July by nine NGOs from Spain, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico and Peru. Over the next two years, RIAPD will be coordinated by the Spain-based organization called SOSDesaparecidos which first <a href=\"https://elcierredigital.com/salud-y-bienestar/864672138/sosdesaparecidos-implementa-reconocimiento-facial-personas-buscadas.html\">launched</a> the facial recognition initiative in March.\n\n\u201cWe were looking for a simple solution so that people can collaborate with little effort and so that any association in the world can replicate the same method and help us in international disappearances,\u201d president of SOSDesaparecidos, Joaqu\u00edn Amills told Spanish investigative journalism outlet Elcierre Digital.\n\nStarting in September, other organizations from the European Union will be joining the alliance. The organization aims to share digital tools and work methodologies as well as promote international cooperation, says Amills, adding that the project will maintain the privacy of volunteers.\n\n\u201cRIAPD is not only a tool for disappeared persons and their families, but also a framework for collaboration with different police forces and government authorities of each country,\u201d <a href=\"https://elcierredigital.com/salud-y-bienestar/558252748/primera-red-global-busqueda-personas-desaparecidas.html\">says </a>Amills.\n\nBiometric systems to either identify unclaimed bodies or missing persons are in use in many countries including <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/south-african-province-deploys-biometrics-to-identify-unclaimed-bodies-reduce-crime\">South Africa</a>,<a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202104/nepal-parliamentary-committee-mandates-use-of-biometrics-to-identify-unclaimed-bodies\"> Nepal</a>,<a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/facial-recognition-used-to-identify-victims-of-deadly-train-accident-in-india\"> Pakistan</a> and<a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202302/facial-recognition-helps-identify-144-children-rescued-from-turkey-earthquake-rubble\"> Turkey</a>.

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is often criticized for the slow pace of airport processes, and the long delays experienced by many travellers. The TSA is an early adopter of mobile driver\u2019s licenses (mDLs), however, which hold significant promise for reducing how long security checks take, and therefore the lineups of people waiting to go through them.\n\nAmericans average close to <a href=\"https://upgradedpoints.com/travel/airports/average-tsa-security-wait-times-us-airports/\">an hour waiting in TSA lineups</a> during peak hours at the nation\u2019s busiest airports, based on an analysis of the agency\u2019s own statistics.\n\nTSA is not only rolling out new technology to make use of mDLs as more states launch them, it, and the Department of Homeland Services more broadly, is actively working on faster ways to get people through the necessary security checks. Those efforts are starting to bear fruit.\n<h2>What the TSA is doing</h2>\nThe TSA is leading the adoption of digital credentials to automate most security checks. Digital travel credentials can be processed in as little time as it takes people to make a payment with their smartphone. As holding out your phone to complete an interaction becomes more familiar, the TSA is rolling out a new version of its Credential Authentication Technology (CAT) scanners to airports across the country so they can accept digital credentials.\n\nMost of those digital credentials that Americans have today are mDLs issued by state motor vehicle authorities. The <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202206/flash-a-qr-and-your-face-biometrics-and-american-will-put-you-in-a-jet-seat\">American Airlines Mobile ID</a>, created in collaboration with Thales and Airside, is based on the same technologies and is equivalent to a state-issued mDL for TSA security check purposes.\n\nBoth make use of the <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html\">ISO/IEC 18013-5</a> standard, which extends the global standard for driver\u2019s licenses to digital credentials held on a mobile device. The use of this standard by all digital ID credentials provides a common basis on which TSA can accept any of them at any airport equipped with the new CAT II scanners, and rapidly scale the system to cover the entire U.S.\n\nmDL acceptance at TSA security checkpoints will be in conjunction with TSA rolling out the new CAT technology supporting digital credentials over the next year or so. For now, travellers must be enrolled in TSA PreCheck to use their digital ID for security checks.\n\nSimilar efforts in other countries also means that Americans will soon be able to use their digital IDs in overseas airports, and vice versa.\n<h2>How it helps</h2>\nThe new security check process consists of all the same steps from a security perspective. How the steps are carried out is changed and automated, however, so that they may appear instantaneous or invisible to the traveller.\n\nOn approaching a TSA checkpoint, the traveller presents a QR code on their mobile device and has a photo taken. The ID and photo images are matched, along with flight and other information, and the passenger is cleared. This typically happens in <a href=\"https://news.aa.com/news/news-details/2022/American-Airlines-Launches-Mobile-ID-With-TSA-PreCheck-OPS-OTH-06/default.aspx\">less than five seconds</a>, according to American\u2019s assessments.\n\nIn addition to the speed of the check itself, the TSA is scanning mobile IDs at dedicated lanes. That means if you are eligible for a mobile ID, you have the option of a line that is often the shortest available.\n\nThe privacy of travellers\u2019 data is protected in several ways. All data from the ID is transmitted and stored in encrypted form, and deleted by TSA after it is verified to protect against potential data breaches. Less data is presented to TSA agents, and the device itself stays in the hands of the traveler.\n\nDevice-based security measures, like Face ID or Touch ID biometrics on Apple devices, can also help prevent someone else from viewing or presenting your digital ID, even if your phone is stolen.\n\nThe same technology has also been used already by travellers in trials to access lounges and complete self-bag drop processes.\n<h2>What comes next</h2>\nThere are currently only eight states issuing mDLs on a production basis, though roughly as many are actively working towards launches.\n\nThat means the American Airlines Mobile ID is the only way for most Americans with U.S. Passports or U.S. Drivers licenses from forty-one participating states to take advantage of the new airport fast-lanes right now.\n\nAs the technology reaches more airports, and more states issue mDLs, further adoption by state governments, such as for access to online public services, and by the private sector, such as for age verification or KYC checks, will motivate people to get their own.\n\nBoth age verification and KYC checks are becoming more common, too. Several states, including Arkansas, Virginia, Louisiana and Texas have all passed age verification requirements for accessing adult content. The same limited disclosure and other privacy protections used at the airport could enable residents of those states to access websites without exposing their personal data.\n\nIn the meantime, Americans using digital IDs in airports will often make it through screening process faster than their fellow travellers, thanks to some forward-looking decisions by the TSA.\n<h2>About the author</h2>\nNeville Pattinson is the Head of Federal Government Sales at Thales Group\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/thales-digital-identity-and-security\">DIS Identity &amp; Biometric Solutions</a> team based in Austin, TX.

It is the sixth allegation of facial recognition prompting the arrest of the wrong person in America, and the third in Detroit. All six incorrectly identified people are Black.\n\nA lawsuit has been filed by Detroit resident Porcha Woodruff, who was 8 months pregnant when she was arrested for carjacking and robbery, <a href=\"https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/detroit-city/2023/08/06/woman-files-lawsuit-claims-faulty-dpd-facial-recognition-hit-prompted-her-false-arrest/70523848007/\">The Detroit News</a> reports. A photo of the suspect was matched with an eight-year old mugshot photo of Woodruff, despite the availability of her recent driver\u2019s license photo, according to court filings.\n\nDetroit police <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202009/us-lawmakers-extend-police-face-biometrics-contract-in-detroit-moratorium-advances-in-vermont\">extended a contract</a> for facial recognition software from Dataworks Plus and Rank One Computing in 2020.\n\nWoodruff\u2019s attorneys write that the officer who obtained the warrant for her arrest neglected to mention the age of the reference image used for the biometric match. If that information had been disclosed, they say, the warrant may have been denied for lack of probably cause.\n\nWhen Woodruff\u2019s image was returned as a match candidate for the probe, her eight-year old mugshot was placed in a photo lineup, where it was picked out by the victim.\n\nThe case against Woodruff was dismissed during a preliminary examination for lack of evidence.\n\nWhen she was arrested, Woodruff was held for 11 hours, and she was treated for dehydration on release, she told the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/06/business/facial-recognition-false-arrest.html\">New York Times</a>, adding further emotional weight to the story. The person who participated in the carjacking, and whose image was captured by a security camera, was not visibly pregnant.\n\nDetroit Police Chief James White said the allegations in the lawsuit are \u201cvery concerning,\u201d and the department will perform \u201cadditional investigation,\u201d as quoted by The Detroit News. He also told the police oversight board that a supervisor had reviewed the case before authorizing the warrant affidavit, and proper procedure was followed.\n\nThe ACLU filed a <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202104/aclu-seeks-to-make-facial-recognition-use-by-police-a-civil-rights-issue-with-wrongful-arrest-suit\">federal lawsuit</a> seeking to make Detroit police stop using facial recognition in 2021, in response to the false arrest of Robert Williams. The arrests of Williams, Woodruff, and Michael Oliver in Detroit all took place within the last three years. In Williams\u2019 case, White\u2019s predecessor James Craig told 60 Minutes that the arrest resulted from \u201csloppy, <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202105/amazon-extends-police-facial-recognition-moratorium\">sloppy investigative work</a>.\u201d\n\nPsychology professor Gary Wells, who has researched the reliability of eyewitnesses, says that facial recognition systems with enough reference images will always find one that looks like the probe, and the eyewitness will usually assume that the correct person\u2019s image is among those they are shown. This makes the combination unreliable, he says.\n\nAssessments by the National Institute of Standards and Technology show that many leading facial recognition algorithms are just as accurate for Black men as other groups of people, but others are not. It also shows that even <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202207/nist-seeks-feedback-on-measurement-of-biometric-bias\">measuring demographic fairness</a> in facial recognition algorithms, let alone whole systems, remains a challenge.", "link": "https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/black-woman-matched-by-facial-recognition-alleges-police-misconduct-in-lawsuit", "date_published": "2023-08-07T15:18:33+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}]
