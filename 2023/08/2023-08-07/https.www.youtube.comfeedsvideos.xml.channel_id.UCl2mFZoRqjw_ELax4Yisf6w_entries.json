If NAND corrupts/dies, machine CANNOT BE TURNED ON AT ALL!\n02:39 - This NAND is propriatery custom designs that cannot be purchased on its own\n03:45 - Donor Macbook boards with NANDs cost $300+ and have used NAND that may have 50 TB of write cycles\n04:24 - Only place to buy these NANDs new is a 1 TB SSD kit on apple.com for $600...\n05:17 - Part 3 - New NANDs die more often in a way that destroys power to the entire machine\n06:09 - This was NOT a problem with the older, standard NANDs\n06:48 - Apple drives the industry forward with common sense innovation - I appreciate that\n08:32 - Too often, these innovations come at the cost of common sense design, durability, repairability, and reliability\n09:38 - These new custom NANDs fail WAY TOO OFTEN\n09:58 - Thesis\n12:16 - This isn't fun anymore\n17:25 - Repeating myself, because my name is Louis Rossmann\n17:50 - Pre-written rebuttal to the engineer's argument", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYG4VMqatEY", "date_published": "2023-08-07T18:12:11+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/RYG4VMqatEY/hqdefault.jpg"}]
