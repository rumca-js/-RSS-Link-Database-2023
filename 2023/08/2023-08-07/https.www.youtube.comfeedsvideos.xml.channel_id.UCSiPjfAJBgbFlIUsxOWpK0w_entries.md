Nat here. This was my first time writing horn parts for a song! I donâ€™t read or transcribe music very well. So I sang all the parts and exported stems, which Vikram (the trombone player) then converted to sheet music for three horn players. ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯Â Sometimes my lack of theoretical musical knowledge makes me think that someone else should be in charge of composing. Itâ€™s easier to trust someone with a degree in composition than to trust my own musical instincts. But Iâ€™m glad that I pushed through the imposter syndrome, because writing horn parts is really fun. Also can someone please tell me WHY TROMBONES SOUND SO GOOD????
