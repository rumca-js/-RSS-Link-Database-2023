  <p id="uA8aB6">BrightDrop, the electric delivery spinoff of General Motors, is bringing its battery-powered delivery vans to Mexico as its next market. The company now covers all of North America after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/5/23493777/gm-brightdrop-canada-zevo-cami-plant-dhl-express">expanding to Canada last year</a>. </p>
<p id="v8VuMP">The first two products that will be available to customers in Mexico will be the company’s Zevo 400 and Zevo 600 delivery vans. The Zevo 600 sports a 165 kWh battery pack for 250 miles of range. The Zevo 400 is smaller and nimbler — though we’re still waiting for more specific specs when it starts production later this year. Customers in Mexico will be able to place orders for the vans through BrightDrop’s website also starting later this year. </p>

It also comes with a low-profile bracket, which is a nice touch. </p>

<p id="o3GJur">The game launches for the two systems on August 17th, more than a decade after it first showed its hide on the PS3 and Xbox 360.

  <p id="uJEhTT">Microsoft is bringing its AI-powered Bing Chat to mobile browsers soon. While Bing Chat has been available in separate Android and iOS mobile apps <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/22/23610048/microsoft-bing-ai-chatbot-availability-ios-android-edge-skype-apps">since late February</a>, Microsoft is opening it up to all mobile browsers as part of the broader changes to stop blocking Bing Chat on third-party browsers.</p>
<p id="z0gbyt">Bing Chat first launched in February, but it was restricted to Microsoft’s own Edge browser. Microsoft started opening up to Chrome and Safari desktop browsers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/24/23805493/bing-ai-chat-google-chrome-safari">in late July</a> as part of testing for full third-party browser support. </p>
<p id="J6Drli">“With so many new, useful features now a part of Bing, we’re excited to announce you can start experiencing the new AI-powered Bing in third-party browsers on web and mobile soon,” says the <a href="https://blogs.bing.com/search/august-2023/Celebrating-6-months-of-the-new-AI-powered-Bing">Bing team in a blog post</a>....</p>

  <p id="iULFjL">WhatsApp’s latest beta has a new voice chat feature that lets groups of up to 32 people connect for a spoken session, according to <a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-23-16-19-whats-new/">beta notes published by <em>WABetaInfo</em></a>. WhatsApp beta version 2.23.16.19 is rolling out to testers on Android, adding features similar to Telegram and Discord chats, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556992/slack-huddles-audio-calls-feature-launch-discord-like">Slack’s Huddles</a>, and even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/20/11474326/facebook-messenger-app-mobile-group-calling-50-people">Meta’s own</a> Messenger platform.</p>
<p id="RX73AQ">If it’s live in your version of the app, you’ll notice a waveform icon within group chats — but only if the WhatsApp account has the feature enabled and includes compatibility with the group. Tapping the button immediately launches voice chat, along with its own interface. Then, anyone in the group, up to 32 people, can just jump in and start talking.

<p id="TO4s0n">With PYUSD, you can make person-to-person payments, fund purchases with the currency at checkouts, and transfer PYUSD between PayPal and other outside wallets. PayPal says that you can also convert the currencies supported by PayPal to and from PYUSD as well.</p>

  <p id="LH34zc">The next time you want a quick gut check on whether a sentence is grammatically accurate, Google Search might have the answer. <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/08/06/google-search-grammar-check/"><em>9to5Google </em>has spotted</a> a “grammar check” feature that will offer suggestions on whether a given phrase is grammatically accurate. For example, type “the quick brown fox jump over the lazy dog” into the search engine and Google will highlight that you probably meant “jumps” instead of “jump.” </p>
<p id="IX4mpe">Although most people probably don’t care about the grammar of their search phrases, we suspect this tool is meant to be more general purpose. If one of your sentences looks off when you type it into a messaging app for example, Google’s hope seems to be that you’ll give it a check with Google Search — because anything that...</p>
