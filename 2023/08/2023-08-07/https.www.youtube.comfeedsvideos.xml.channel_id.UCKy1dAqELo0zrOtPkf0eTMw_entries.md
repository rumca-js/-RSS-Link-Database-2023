In today's Daily Fix:
After months of leaks and teases, Activision has officially confirmed their next Call of Duty is Modern Warfare III, a sequel to last year's Modern Warfare II. The confirmation came via a tweet that revealed the game's November 10, 2023 release date, and a tease for the big reveal in Call of Duty: Warzone. In other news, Rockstar has confirmed the existence of an updated port of Red Dead Redemption, and it will gallop onto the Nintendo Switch and PS4 later this month. Unfortunately it's not the remaster or remake that fans have hoped for, but it'll still be cool roam the Wild West on your Switch. And in kind of related news, a modder got Bloodborne running at 1080p 60FPS on the PS5, but you have to jailbreak your console first. This might hold fans over until Fromsoft gets around to releasing a proper remaster of the game for current-gen consoles.
