Timestamps:
00:00 - Intro
00:18 - Part 1 - Apple begins soldering on the SSD w/ A1706 & A1707 model in 2016
00:30 - If SSD dies, you can still turn machine on & boot from a flash drive, USB-C external drive, etc
01:03 - Part 2 - Apple adds the T2 chip in 2018 
01:45 - T2 chip runs bridgeOS which is stored on NAND
02:01 - T2 chip necessary for computer to turn on. If NAND corrupts/dies, machine CANNOT BE TURNED ON AT ALL!
02:39 - This NAND is propriatery custom designs that cannot be purchased on its own
03:45 - Donor Macbook boards with NANDs cost $300+ and have used NAND that may have 50 TB of write cycles
04:24 - Only place to buy these NANDs new is a 1 TB SSD kit on apple.com for $600...
05:17 - Part 3 - New NANDs die more often in a way that destroys power to the entire machine
06:09 - This was NOT a problem with the older, standard NANDs
06:48 - Apple drives the industry forward with common sense innovation - I appreciate that
08:32 - Too often, these innovations come at the cost of common sense design, durability, repairability, and reliability
09:38 - These new custom NANDs fail WAY TOO OFTEN
09:58 - Thesis
12:16 - This isn't fun anymore
17:25 - Repeating myself, because my name is Louis Rossmann
17:50 - Pre-written rebuttal to the engineer's argument
