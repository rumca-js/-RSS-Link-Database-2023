<p>In the US, gun purchases by Latinos have surged in recent years – including among self-described progressives. Some are anxious about being armed but feel they have little choice</p><p>On a crisp Sunday afternoon in Royse City, Texas, 32-year-old Cesar Hurtado unzipped a hardshell case to reveal a custom-built AR-15-style rifle in his living room.

## A giant oarfish: the mirrored harbinger of earthquakes | Helen Sullivan

<p>Oarfish swim vertically, moving up and down and side to side like a cursor. It would be easier to believe they do not exist</p><p>A giant oarfish, also known as the “king of herrings”, is an eight-metre long ribbon of silver, tapered at its tail and on its head wearing a permanently stunned face – as though moments ago it was a normal herring and then the world’s largest chef slapped it down on a benchtop and rolled over it with a rolling pin.<br /><br />“These are unpredictable fish,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/science/earth/oarfish-offer-chance-to-study-an-elusive-animal-long-thought-a-monster.html">research biologist Milton Love told</a> the New York Times 10 years ago. But in Japan, oarfish are considered highly predictable: they predict the future. See an oarfish, the story goes, and an earthquake will follow. In the months before Japan’s 2011 earthquake, one of the most powerful ever recorded, 20 oarfish were found on beaches. They’re known as “messengers from the sea god’s palace”, or jinja hime, “shrine princesses”.</p><p>The sea god’s palace, Ryūgū-jō, has four sides, each of which faces one of the four seasons. The expression on the oarfish’s face, with one wide eye on each side, makes sense viewed like this, too – one side is seeing the past and the other the future. Things don’t look good: looking east it sees plum and cherry blossoms, looking west it sees a maple tree making “<a href="https://archive.org/details/mythslegendsofja00davirich/page/326/mode/2up">fire in the branches</a>”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/commentisfree/2023/aug/08/a-giant-oarfish-the-mirrored-harbinger-of-earthquakes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Former president wrote ‘If you go after me, I’m coming after you,’ prompting Jack Smith’s prosecutors to try restrict what Trump team can share publicly</p><p>Good morning, US politics blog readers. Mere days have passed since special counsel <strong>Jack Smith</strong> indicted <strong>Donald Trump</strong> for his failed effort to reverse his 2020 election loss, but the two sides are already battling over what the former president can say and do. On Friday, Trump wrote “IF YOU GO AFTER ME, I’M COMING AFTER YOU!”, prompting Smith’s prosecutors to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/05/donald-trump-threatening-social-media-post-flagged-by-prosecutors-in-court-filing">request a protective order</a> that would restrict what the former president’s legal team can share publicly, saying it is necessary to guard people involved in the case against retaliation.</p><p>Trump’s lawyers have until 5pm eastern time today to respond. It’s an early salvo in what is expected to be the lengthy process Smith’s case is expected to take, and which will undoubtedly hang over the 2024 election, where Trump is currently the frontrunner. Either way, the former president has not been shy about sharing his thoughts regarding the unprecedented criminal charges leveled against him, and do not be surprised if today is no different.</p><p><strong>Voters in Ohio</strong> are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/06/ohio-issue-1-vote-democracy-future-republicans">gearing up to decide</a> on Tuesday whether to approve a Republican-backed proposal that will raise the bar for changing the state’s constitution.

<p>The stifling religious and social conformity of a small Spanish town is the source of the shocks in this scare story – along with a spectral girl in white</p><p>Here is another sociologically buttressed Spanish-language gothic horror to file alongside The Devil’s Backbone and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/mar/21/worldcinema.horror">The Orphanage</a>. With this film set near 1980s Tarragona, director Víctor García (who has the ninth Hellraiser film, from 2011, on his résumé) draws on a convincing period setting to nourish his scare story – even if the shocks aren’t especially chilling, and the sense of claustrophobic entrapment in the milieu is undermined by a cop-out open ending.</p><p>Teenager Sara (Carla Campra) is newly arrived in town, and struggling to adjust to this backwater with its stifling piety and social snobbery. After letting off some steam at a club with her hothead pal Rebe (Aina Quiñones) and hitching a lift back with a pair of local bad boys, they almost crash when a spectral girl in a communion dress runs in front of their car. Obviously Chucky hadn’t come out in Spain at this point, because they walk away with her creepy, pucker-faced communion doll. A mottled infection begins spreading up Sara’s arm, and she begins experiencing appalling visions in broad daylight.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/07/the-communion-girl-review-victor-garcia-spanish-horror">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>PC;</strong> <strong>Kinmoku<br /></strong>This new visual novel from the creator of One Night Stand is an engrossing, emotional study of digital relationships that will hit a raw nerve with gamers</p><p>Anyone who ever played and loved a video game, especially as a teenager, will know that the game itself is often only part of the experience. It is also about community. We seek out other players, through forums, message boards and social media, and sometimes the relationships we form in these haphazard spaces move beyond expressions of shared fandom. They become friendships, support networks, perhaps even romances. Videoverse, the new visual novel from Kinmoku, creator of the acclaimed relationship drama One Night Stand, is an engrossing and emotional study of these digital relationships and the games that precariously support them.</p><p>The year is 2003 and 15-year-old video game fan Emmett spends hours each day on his Shark games console, playing the Japanese role-playing game Feudal Fantasy. When not playing, he is socialising on the machine’s online service, Videoverse, a combination of discussion forum and instant messaging platform. Emmett is part of a thriving, mostly supportive community of gamers and artists, but when the console’s manufacturer, Kinmoku (one of many slyly self-referential elements in the game), seeks to move the user base on to its new Dolphin console, the company announces that Videoverse will soon be switched off, plunging the group into an existential crisis.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/aug/07/videoverse-review-a-profound-exploration-of-love-games-and-fandom">Continue reading...</a>

And it was not just five people!”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/07/one-hit-wonder-barbie-world-with-aqua">Continue reading...</a>
