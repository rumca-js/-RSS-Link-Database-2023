In this video we taje the upcoming Khadas Mind Mini PC TO THE next Levle by adding a Powerful Oculink Radeon RX 7600M XT eGPU! This Khadas Mind is a Portable modular mini PC with a 12 core x86 CPU and 32GB OR DDR5 ram. And by it's self it performs amazingly but we do have the option to add more GPU power and since the GPD G1 is an oculink graphics dock I figured we could pair it up and now this tiny PC is Fast!
