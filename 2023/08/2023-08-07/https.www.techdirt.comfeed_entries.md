In 2014, NYC officials decided to replace the city’s dated pay phones with “information kiosks” providing free public Wi-Fi, phone calls, device charging, and a tablet for access to city services, maps and directions. The kiosks were to be funded by “context-aware” ads based on a variety of data collected from kiosk users and NYC [&#8230;]

Cops really hate policing protests that target police. But that has been the reality since Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin ripped the bandage off an unhealed wound by placing his knee on the neck of unarmed black man George Floyd, choking the life out of him during an act that played out like an anthropomorphized [&#8230;]

There’s an interesting thing that happens all too often in trademark cases, whereby people seem to flip the underlying argument. We see it in cases where someone opposes the registration of a certain trademark, and the party seeking the trademark complains that the government is trying to “censor” them or limit their speech, when more [&#8230;]

There are no incentives in place to encourage accurate reporting of force deployment by law enforcement agencies. Tracking use of force means agencies are basically generating evidence for civil rights lawsuits. That&#8217;s why force reporting is, at best, inconsistent. At its worst, it&#8217;s simply dishonest. The lack of solid deterrents means agencies simply won&#8217;t generate [&#8230;]

Well this is dumb. First off, let’s just remind everyone that in a moment of pure stupidity, Salesforce.com founder and CEO Marc Benioff called for Section 230 to be “abolished.” Specifically, he claimed that websites “must have standards and practices decided by law” and that websites “need to be held accountable” for what users do [&#8230;]

Cable executives spent years denying that &#8220;cord cutting&#8221; (ditching traditional TV) was real. For years they insisted it was a &#8220;fiction,&#8221; or that it was a fad that would end once Millennials started procreating. Whatever gave them permission to not meaningfully evolve their often predatory, anti-competitive business strategies. Yeah, about that. Major cable companies continue [&#8230;]
