<p>Easy Firewall, available for $25, is not a standalone firewall, but instead a helpful graphical user interface for the complex Windows Firewall already included with your PC. </p>



<p>Easy Firewall lists which applications have received permissions to send data to the internet or receive data from there. If an app tries to obtain rights that it did not have before, you about it in real time and can decide for yourself whether you want to allow it.</p>



<p>You can also change the existing rules with a few mouse clicks. For example, some programs require Internet access to enable activation, but do not actually need access to the network afterwards. Easy Firewall makes changing that access, well, easy. The tool uses a dialogue box to explain, without any technical jargon, what each setting means, though there is still a definite learning curve involved with wrapping your head around Windows Firewall management.</p>



<p>A convenient feature is the <strong>panic mode</strong>: With a mouse click, all Internet connections can immediately be cut. It&rsquo;s even faster than, say, using Windows network settings to disconnect your PC from your network. If you suspect you&rsquo;re under attack, it&rsquo;s a handy feature.</p>



<p><strong>Alternative:</strong> If you&rsquo;re looking for more control over how the Windows Firewall behaves, but aren&rsquo;t sure whether you want to spend $25 on Easy Firewall&rsquo;s straightforward design and presentation, Binisoft&rsquo;s free tool <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.binisoft.org/wfc&amp;xcust=2-2-2020912-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Windows Firewall Control</a> offers similar features.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Easy Firewall simplifies the handling of the Windows Firewall, which otherwise works largely automatically. It may be overkill for a lot of people &mdash; Windows Firewall tends to handle its job well despite being in the background &mdash; but for more technically inclined users, it should be informative to learn which programs establish network connections at all, and how they do so. Whether the Windows Firewall would have done its job better or worse without your intervention may vary from case to case and is hard to gauge, however.</p>

## Best Buy is slashing the price of this brand new Chromebook to $179

<p>Lenovo launched its most recent Slim 3 Chromebook in May. Customer reviews love it. But Best Buy has slashed the price by 44 percent down to a paltry $179. Why?</p>



<p>Unfamiliarity, we suspect. Most people have heard of Qualcomm and its Arm chips, but MediaTek is an up-and-coming CPU supplier that also licenses Arm CPUs from Arm Ltd. MediaTek <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1377308/mediatek-still-plans-to-enter-the-pc-market.html">launched the Kompanio 520 CPU</a> late last year into the Chromebook space and Lenovo signed on to build it into its <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1522341/1522341.html">Slim 3 Chromebooks</a> this past May. </p>



<p>The Kompanio 520 is an eight-core Arm CPU with an improved dual-core graphics engine, so it&rsquo;s a cutting-edge CPU in a market where retailers still sell <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2006308/dont-be-fooled-by-back-to-school-chromebook-trap-deals.html">Chromebook trap deals</a> that use out-of-date and discontinued hardware. However, even <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/818199/back-to-school-deals.html">legitimate back-to-school deals on Chromebooks</a> still use CPUs that are several years out of date.</p>



<p>The Lenovo Slim 3 includes the Kompanio chip and 4GB of RAM, which we try to shy away from because it can limit the amount of tabs and applications. But the processor is certainly peppy enough, the screen is a solid 14-inch 1080p display, there&rsquo;s a good keyboard, and customers rave about the battery life&hellip; all for under $200. This is a steal, especially at $179.</p>

<p>Whether you&rsquo;re thrilled to bits about it or lack any enthusiasm whatsoever, back-to-school season is here and ready to roll. With the arrival of back-to-school season comes a lot of awesome deals. If I had to guess, the top item on your list is likely going to be a laptop, especially if you&rsquo;re a high school student or incoming college freshman. So, if you&rsquo;re in the market for one, there&rsquo;s no better time than now to take the plunge. Ah, but where to begin?</p>



<p>Fortunately for you, Dell is holding its annual back-to-school sale right now. And, if you happen to buy an eligible laptop, the manufacturer will <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/lp/students&amp;xcust=2-1-2020580-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">donate to UNICEF</a>, which helps schools get on the world wide web. Pretty cool, right? Dell laptops are also known for being well-priced, durable, and luxurious (especially the XPS line). I&rsquo;ve been a fan of Dell laptops for years and I find that the customer support is top-notch, too. If you have no idea where to begin, don&rsquo;t worry, from lightweight 2-in-1s to powerful gaming machines, I&rsquo;ve assembled a diverse list for you.</p>

</ul>



<p>The Inspiron 15 Laptop offers a good amount of processing power for the price. The AMD Ryzen 7 5700U CPU inside of this machine has a max boost clock of up to 4.3GHz, 16 threads, and eight cores. Having more cores and threads is always preferable in a CPU.  </p>

<p>If you need a little extra firepower in the graphics department, you should consider picking up a gaming laptop. The options below are souped-up with powerful hardware as well as spacious high refresh-rate screens. This is important, especially when you&rsquo;re in the middle of an intensive match in which every second matters.</p>

</ul>



<p>If you&rsquo;re after the ultimate gaming experience, then the Alienware x16 Gaming Laptop is worth considering. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 GPU is powerful enough to run most modern games on the High or Ultra graphics preset. The display&rsquo;s 165Hz refresh rate should also help produce smooth visuals.</p>

<p>If portability is at the top of your priority list, 2-in-1 laptops are the way to go. They&rsquo;re generally more lightweight than traditional clamshell laptops and you can swing the screen around 360 degrees. That means you can use it like a tablet or prop it up like a tent for sharing information. </p>

<p>The XPS 13 2-in-1 Laptop is <em>very </em>lightweight at under two pounds. It&rsquo;s the perfect traveling companion, especially if you plan on taking it to class with you. It also has a beautiful 1920p touch display with active pen support. According to the manufacturer, the display has a maximum brightness of 500 nits.

<p>You can brighten up your Windows 11 desktop with the so-called themes. These are unified combinations of background image(s), colors for the various interface elements (like the taskbar and title bar), new sound files, and changes to the mouse pointer and other elements, all enabled at once with the click of a button.</p>



<p>That said, there are only a few native Windows 11 themes to choose from in the Settings app under <em>Personalization &gt; Themes</em>. Microsoft offers you many, many more if you click on the link &ldquo;Get more themes from the Microsoft Store&rdquo; (Windows 10) or on the button &ldquo;Browse themes&rdquo; to the right (Windows 11). The Microsoft Store will then open and list a considerable number of designs, some free and some you have to pay for.</p>

<p>The best Windows Hello webcams log you in to your computer as well as serve as a traditional webcam, saving you time and making you look great on video calls. And now there are more than ever to choose from. </p>



<p>Why buy a Windows Hello webcam? <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393756/1080p-webcam-buying-guide.html">A recommended 1080p webcam</a> helps you look your best in video calls in Microsoft Teams or Zoom. But Microsoft&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2953512/hands-on-with-windows-10s-windows-hello-it-just-works.html">biometric Windows Hello system </a>uses a depth camera plus facial-recognition technology to log you in to Windows 10 or Windows 11 in a split second. It makes sense people would want to pair a&nbsp;desktop PC or laptop&nbsp;with a Windows Hello-compatible webcam in order to get its convenient security benefits.</p>



<p>Windows Hello webcams from Logitech and Dell top our list for now. The good news for you is that webcam manufacturers have recognized Windows Hello is a premium feature, making more available for you to buy. Some cost less than $100. Most include premium features such as 1080p resolution, making them an excellent choice as a primary webcam, too.</p>



<p>Below, we&rsquo;ve listed several Windows Hello webcams that we recommend, though we trimmed several that simply didn&rsquo;t live up to our expectations. Want more information? We&rsquo;ve included a buying guide and a FAQ after our best Windows Hello webcam picks. You can also review our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393756/1080p-webcam-buying-guide.html">1080p webcam buyer&rsquo;s guide</a> for recommendations of webcams without Windows Hello support.</p>

<p>Logitech&rsquo;s Brio is often the default choice for a solid Windows Hello webcam. It still ranks highly among premium webcams, primarily because it&rsquo;s one of the few autofocusing webcams that captures in 4K resolution. Windows Hello comes along for the ride. The Brio includes a ton of features to make you look great, and its Windows Hello support will log you in in a snap. The MSRP is $199.99, but you can often find it for much less (hurray, competition!). That is, when this popular camera isn&rsquo;t sold out.</p>

<p>For many, Logitech&rsquo;s Brio 4K Ultra HD will be overkill. But a legion of devoted fans also consider it to be the gold standard for PC webcams, with or without Windows Hello.&nbsp;(For right now, we&rsquo;ve reinstated it as one of our picks for the best webcam, period.)</p>

<p>It offers a ton of features:&nbsp;HDR, auto-focusing, digital zoom (up to 5X), framing, brightness, saturation, and more. Unusually, the WB7022 is neither fixed-focus, nor does it offer a fixed field of view (FOV). Dell&rsquo;s AI framing crops the image to keep your face centered, and you have the option of configuring the field of view from 90 degrees, 78 degrees, and down to a narrow 65 degrees. Dell applies HDR, temporal, and spatial noise reduction to help you look your best.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no mic (Dell uses your laptop instead) and a magnetic privacy shutter that clips on. See our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3622908/dell-ultrasharp-4k-webcam-price-specs-features.html">story on&nbsp;Dell&rsquo;s WB7022</a>.</p>

<p>Honestly, many of you will probably buy this Windows Hello webcam and simply not miss the more expensive alternatives. About the only feature you may miss in this 1080p, 30fps webcam is autofocus capability, and most fixed-focus webcams are tuned for the average distance (in the HelloCam&rsquo;s case, between 12.4 and 47.2 inches) that someone sits from their laptop or display.  The field of view is a relatively narrow 90 degrees.</p>

<p>This webcam ships with both noise-cancelling mics as well as auto-exposure capabilities, which should leave you looking and sounding professional on your next Zoom call or Teams meeting. There&rsquo;s a privacy cover, too, for when this webcam is not in use. Interestingly, the privacy shutter is software-controlled, but the lens cover is orange &mdash; in other words, it should be obvious when your camera can and can&rsquo;t see you. NexiGo does require its utility software to be installed.</p>

<p>You may consider the USB-A to USB-C cable a bit finicky and short, but that&rsquo;s a small knock on an otherwise solid value. The cable can also be replaced.</p>

<p>The IPTNIC 1080p webcam (avoid buying the 720p model, the TP01) is a relative newcomer, and its strength is that it&rsquo;s the bargain-basement option. </p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t expect that much from the built-in webcam, although we&rsquo;d expect it to work fairly well in full light. The only potential hitch is that it may need a driver to set up Windows Hello; Amazon&rsquo;s page seems to conflate the TP01 and the TP02 in the reviews section. Once that&rsquo;s set up, we&rsquo;d expect the webcam to work as expected. Just make sure that you have it plugged in to a USB 3.0 port (as opposed to the slower 5Gbps USB 2.0 port) so that it will work properly.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-to-look-for-in-a-windows-hello-webcam">What to look for in a Windows Hello webcam</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/422745/hands-on-with-windows-10s-windows-hello-it-just-works.html">Windows Hello dates back to 2015</a>, and the introduction of Windows 10 running on Microsoft&rsquo;s Surface hardware. It replaces the need to type your password to log in every time you sit down at your desk, providing a speedy yet secure compromise to secure your PC.</p>



<p>Typically, Windows Hello is associated with depth-camera technology, which recognizes the various contours of your face, identifying you and only you.  (A normal webcam doesn&rsquo;t understand that it&rsquo;s looking at a 3D image.) The image is then compared with a reference image which is stored during setup. The process itself is fast: It takes just a second or two for a Windows Hello webcam to recognize you, verify your identity to the PC it&rsquo;s connected to via a USB cable, and log you in. Windows Hello can also read your fingerprint with a separate Windows Hello fingerprint reader, but these webcams are all you need.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1080p">1080p </h3>



<p>The resolution of the webcam matters. Most laptops still ship with 720p webcams, and a higher-resolution webcam will make you look better than your colleagues.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="fixed-focus-versus-autofocus">Fixed-focus versus autofocus </h3>



<p>A worthwhile but not critical feature, autofocus will keep you in focus if you move back and forth, walk around the room, or so on. Fixed-focus webcams usually work just fine for normal use.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="auto-exposure">Auto-exposure </h3>



<p>Most webcams will adjust their exposure for the available lighting, but superior webcams will do so in a way that makes you look well-lit and not a webcam zombie.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="noise-cancellation">Noise cancellation </h3>



<p>Running a fan in the background? Are the neighbors mowing their lawn or blowing their leaves away? A good noise-cancelling webcam with a mic will filter out these background noises.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>The webcam, a USB cable to connect it to your PC, and a desktop or laptop with Windows 10 or Windows 11 are all you need. We&rsquo;ve never seen a webcam that uses a proprietary USB cable, so you can always spend a few dollars and buy a longer one if for some reason if it&rsquo;s too short.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>After buying a webcam, make sure you have a Windows 10 or Windows 11 PC. Connect the webcam to the PC via the USB cable and that should be all you need for basic webcam functionality. (Some webcams require you to install their utility software for Windows Hello to function, however.) In the Windows 10 or Windows 11 Settings menu, search for &ldquo;Set up face sign-in.&rdquo;  Then click the &ldquo;Facial recognition (Windows Hello)&rdquo; menu.</p>



<p>When that screen appears, you&rsquo;ll need to add a PIN or password as a backup. Be sure that your PC is using your webcam (though it should by default). Windows Hello setup requires simply looking at the screen while the webcam looks at you and records your image.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>In general, yes. You shouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about a rebellious teen holding up a photo they snapped of your face and logging in. Just be sure to secure your PC by logging out or setting a timeout function if you get up from your PC and walk away. </p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>That can happen, over time. A beard (or lack of one), new glasses, a big hat, or something else that obscures your face can interfere with Windows Hello. You can always go to (on Windows 11) <em>Settings&gt; Accounts &gt; Sign-in options</em> and &ldquo;improve recognition&rdquo; &mdash; the phrase Windows uses for updating what you look like to your PC.</p>

<p>If you spring for Google&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2002032/youtube-seems-to-be-stealthily-increasing-the-price-for-premium.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">increasingly expensive YouTube Premium service</a>, you might have seen a &ldquo;1080p Premium&rdquo; option on some videos on your iOS, or on your smart TV or Chromecast. According to new reports today, the option is expanding to desktops and laptops via the browser, finally opening it up to millions more users after months in testing. The higher-quality setting is only available on YouTube Premium, but standard 1080p videos (and even higher resolutions) are still available to free users. </p>



<p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/4/23820482/youtube-enhanced-bitrate-1080p-premium-desktop-web-living-room&amp;xcust=2-1-2022158-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Verge reports</a> that the 1080p Premium option, which boosts video quality with an enhanced bitrate that takes it easy on YouTube&rsquo;s compression, is available on desktop browsers starting today. Strangely, YouTube still hasn&rsquo;t enabled the setting on the Android version of the app, even though it&rsquo;s been available on iOS for months. You&rsquo;d think that supporting Google&rsquo;s own mobile platform would be super easy, barely an inconvenience. </p>



<p>The Premium option is visible on the videos that have it enabled, whether or not you&rsquo;re paying. If you don&rsquo;t have a Premium subscription and you click on it, you&rsquo;ll be prompted to sign up. The service, which increased from $11.99 to $13.99 a month for single users back in July, also offers ad-free viewing, mobile downloads, background audio-only playback on iOS and Android, and access to the premium tier of YouTube Music. </p>

## How to use Microsoft’s secret staging tool to unlock new features

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Last week was a banner one for fans of the Windows Insider Program. Microsoft made a big &ldquo;oops&rdquo; by <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2018622/oops-microsoft-accidentally-posts-tool-to-unlock-windows-goodies.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">posting a direct download link to an internal tool</a> for flipping a lot of the internal switches in Windows 11, some of which are used in A/B testing. That made it possible for users to manually enable features that are usually only turned on at random in order for Microsoft to test the results. Actually, using the tool is very much a &ldquo;don&rsquo;t try this at home, kids!&rdquo; situation&mdash;it&rsquo;s possible it might brick your PC&mdash;but if you want to walk on the wild side, here&rsquo;s how you do it. </p>



<p>First of all, you need to be <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/419826/how-to-join-the-windows-10-insider-preview-program.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">running a Windows Insider build</a>. This is an easy and fairly safe process: Just click the Start button on Windows 11, type &ldquo;Windows Insider,&rdquo; and click the result that says &ldquo;Windows Insider Program settings.&rdquo; Click &ldquo;Get started&rdquo; and follow the instructions, choosing from the four channels in descending order of stability: Release Preview, Beta, Dev, and Canary. The Beta channel is recommended for a good mix between access to new features and system stability. You&rsquo;ll need to download the updated version through Windows Update, and possibly reboot once or twice. </p>



<p>Once all that&rsquo;s done and you&rsquo;re running on a Windows Insider build, you&rsquo;ll need the StagingTool.exe program. This is an executable made by Microsoft itself, so it&rsquo;s legit&hellip;but the direct links to it have been removed. They&rsquo;re popping up all over the web and are easy to find, but for various reasons I won&rsquo;t link to it here. Just exercise caution when downloading the file, and run it through a virus scanner for a little extra security. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 staging tool" class="wp-image-2018721" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/windows-11-staging-tool.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>Once you&rsquo;ve got the StagingTool.exe file, you&rsquo;ll need to flex your old-school command line skills. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/395081/open-command-prompt-in-windows.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Open up a Command Prompt</a> or Windows Terminal instance using administrator privileges. Navigate to the folder holding the executable, then type &ldquo;StagingTool.exe /?&rdquo; to see a list of commands. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, the tool isn&rsquo;t all that user-friendly&mdash;which is only to be expected from an internal Microsoft tool that was never meant to be seen by the public. Even the &ldquo;/query&rdquo; command will only list out the internal ID numbers of the features you can enable or disable, with no description of what they actually do. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/how-to-enable-hidden-windows-11-features-with-microsoft-stagingtool/&amp;xcust=2-1-2022008-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">As Bleeping Computer reports</a>, you can check out some of the Windows user forums and Twitter communities to get a look at the juiciest features to use with the &ldquo;/enable&rdquo; command. </p>



<p>Again, please be aware that actually using this tool, even correctly, could do some serious damage to your Windows build or even your computer itself. A complete wipe of your system isn&rsquo;t out of the question here, though it&rsquo;s probably unlikely. To be safe, I&rsquo;d recommend running Windows 11 <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1936055/the-best-virtualization-tools-for-windows.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">either in a virtual machine</a> or on a secondary laptop or desktop, where you aren&rsquo;t keeping singular copies of any important files. </p>

## 4 reasons why I switched from Nvidia to AMD

<p>Nvidia has become one of the 10 most valuable companies in the world in just a few months, crowning a trend that was started with the crypto boom. But while Nvidia is raking in record sales with future technologies, as a gamer I&rsquo;ve turned away&mdash;at least for now.</p>



<p>I&rsquo;ve always thought brand loyalty was a silly concept, especially in the technology sector. A product should be evaluated on its own merits, based on criteria relevant to its intended use. A graphics card, for example, is evaluated on factors such as performance, energy efficiency, range of functions, and price.</p>



<p>The company that manufactures the product should at most be included in the decision if it stands out for social commitment or environmentally friendly production, for example. </p>

<p>Now, no one can claim that Nvidia makes bad graphics cards. On the contrary, the company has set many trends in recent years: G-Sync, ray tracing, DLSS, and Reflex, to name a few. Especially in the upper class, Team Green&rsquo;s ferocious <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html">RTX 4090</a> has no rival. And yet, having recently found myself due for a PC upgrade, I opted for an AMD graphics card.</p>



<p>Although my GeForce RTX 2080 Ti has served me well for years, I recently replaced it with an RX 6950 XT from AMD. Here are my very personal reasons for doing so.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">

<p><strong>Further reading:</strong> Want a glimpse at the other side of things: Here are <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2017022/4-reasons-why-i-switched-from-amd-to-nvidia.html">four reasons why my colleague switched from AMD Radeon to Nvidia GeForce</a> this generation.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="h-die-tucke-der-neuen-technologien">The pitfall of new technologies</h2>



<p>In the past few years, Nvidia has introduced one new technology after another and ultimately (at least currently) won the duel against AMD. With ray tracing, Nvidia has set a graphics trend that will probably be with us for some time to come and in which Team Green is a pioneer. The DLSS upscaling technology is still ahead of the AMD and Intel alternatives.</p>



<p>However, it is becoming more and more of a trend that these innovations are not really backwards compatible&mdash;and that is a disaster from the consumer&rsquo;s point of view. For example, said Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS), whose latest version 3 including frame generation is only compatible with Nvidia&rsquo;s current 40-series cards.</p>



<p>So if you bought a 20- or 30-series card in the past years, possibly for a lot of money given the graphics card prices of the last few years, you are now already looking down the tube.</p>



<p>There are of course technical reasons why these new technologies do not work on old cards. Nevertheless, as a consumer I don&rsquo;t like the feeling when an expensive product is consigned to the antique department by the manufacturer after only a few years. Especially since there is another way, as AMD shows.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Even though Nvidia has good arguments on its side from a technical point of view, AMD has not been idle in recent years either&mdash;and is pursuing a completely different strategy. AMD makes its in-house technologies available to as many users as possible. One example of this is FreeSync, which, in contrast to G-Sync, works with a significantly larger selection of monitors that are often also cheaper than counterparts with G-Sync certification.</p>



<p>It becomes even clearer when comparing FSR against DLSS. While AMD&rsquo;s technology is compatible even with competitor graphics cards from Nvidia and Intel, Nvidia not infrequently excludes GPUs from its own house when it comes to new functions. For example, DLSS only works when using an RTX GPU, older GTX models are left out in the cold, and DLSS 3 Frame Generation only works with the current RTX 40-series graphics cards. AMD relies on industry standards and open source solutions, while Nvidia implements proprietary solutions.</p>



<p>It felt like Nvidia was constantly bringing new features to the market without really addressing the needs of existing customers. Team Red may be a little behind in the latest high-tech features, but it relies on open source technologies and doesn&rsquo;t have to hide at all in fundamental areas like rasterization performance and memory.</p>



<p>And even if ray tracing is now implemented in more and more games, without ray tracing you can play any game, but without rasterization you can&rsquo;t play any game&mdash;apart from a few exceptions with path tracing. </p>

<p>While Nvidia, also as a result of the company&rsquo;s shift towards AI technologies, is indeed a driver of innovation, AMD has increasingly concentrated on the essentials in recent years. A shining example is the built-in video memory, which is becoming increasingly important at higher resolutions and levels of detail.</p>



<p>Only recently, Nvidia has once again shown with the RTX 4060 that the company does not succeed in the balancing act between the use of new technologies and a solid basic configuration. A strong ray tracing performance and DLSS 3 are of little use if the 8GB video memory is no longer sufficient for modern games in full HD. Especially since both technologies further increase the memory requirements.</p>



<p>AMD is not immune to these errors either, as the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1928214/amd-radeon-rx-7600-review.html">Radeon RX 7600 with only 8 GB of RAM</a> also shows, but it often has a better memory configuration, especially in the midrange and upper class. An illustrative example of this is the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1431755/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-radeon-rx-7900-xt-review-rdna-3.html">RX 7900 XTX</a>, which not only has significantly more video memory, but is also cheaper than its Nvidia counterpart, the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1379747/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-tested-5-things.html">RTX 4080</a>. And even in terms of pure rasterization performance, AMD cards are often on a par with or even ahead of Nvidia at the same price.</p>

<p>If we leave the RTX 4090 aside for a moment (at a starting price of $1,600 it&rsquo;s irrelevant for my eventual purchase decisions anyway), you will find an AMD equivalent for every Nvidia card that is on par in terms of memory equipment and rasterization performance. And in most cases, the AMD card will be the cheaper alternative.</p>



<p>Of course, if you value ray tracing and prefer DLSS to AMD&rsquo;s alternative FSR, this question does not arise. Because in these areas Nvidia simply cannot be beaten at the moment, and it is precisely for this reason that the company can also be very creative in its pricing.</p>



<p>AMD, on the other hand, must and wants to convince with classic arguments, namely solid performance, accessible alternative technologies, and ample memory at an attractive price (at least compared to the competition). And if, like me, these points are ultimately decisive for you, then you should at least consider Team Red for your next PC upgrade.</p>

<p>But not only the hardware, but also the software should play a role in the purchase decision. </p>



<p>As a long-time user of an Nvidia graphics card, it is still incomprehensible to me why the manufacturer does not manage to combine all functions in one software program. If I want to change the monitor resolution or refresh rate, activate G-Sync or use Dynamic Super Resolution, I have to do this in the Nvidia control panel, which, by the way, still looks the same as it did 20 years ago. </p>

<p>If, on the other hand, a game is to be optimized automatically or the game recorded or streamed via ShadowPlay, then GeForce Experience is necessary. As an old hand, I now know where to find which setting, but for newcomers it is already user-unfriendly if you have to click through two applications until you find the desired setting. In addition, the use of GeForce Experience requires a user account.</p>



<p>With AMD, on the other hand, the AMD software Adrenalin Edition can be installed together with the driver. There is no need to log in and all functions can be found clearly in one application. </p>

<p>LastPass is one of the biggest third-party password managers out there and it used to hold that position for a good reason. The free plan supported multiple types of devices, the paid plan was a worthwhile upgrade for $12 per year, and it had a decent enough user interface overall. Even when the company suffered from several security incidents, its responses seemed to warrant the benefit of the doubt.</p>



<p>But over time, features got cut from the free plan and the price of the paid plan went up. Rival password managers also started pushing more innovative features. And then came the major breach in 2022, one in which data in customers&rsquo; vaults were stolen <em>and</em> revealed as not fully encrypted.</p>

<p>A long while back, I started an account with LastPass to maintain the passwords for a loved one and even after last year&rsquo;s hack, I didn&rsquo;t leave immediately. (Change is hard for this person). But after some gentle, prolonged coaxing, I got the green light to switch them to another password manager at last and I&rsquo;m so glad to finally move on to greener pastures. LastPass&rsquo;s problems are just too numerous to stick it out&hellip;including when you&rsquo;re actually in the process of leaving.</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re still with LastPass and been wondering if you should jump, here&rsquo;s what tipped me over the edge and why I don&rsquo;t plan on ever returning.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-2022-security-breaches">The 2022 security breaches</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Screenshot of LastPass security bulletin" class="wp-image-2014018" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lastpass.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>LastPass&rsquo;s disclosures about its 2022 security breaches was like watching a train wreck in slow motion. First came the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/917244/lastpass-got-hacked-but-you-werent-2.html">initial announcement in August</a>, which claimed that no customer data was affected&mdash;just a developer environment. Then <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1419901/lastpass-got-hacked-again-and-this-time-your-data-got-taken.html">three months later</a> came an update that customer data <em>was</em> affected. Nearly a month after that, the company revealed that customer information and password vaults had been stolen. Not only that, but elements in those vaults (including URLs) <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.lastpass.com/help/what-data-was-accessed&amp;xcust=2-1-2013960-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">had not been encrypted</a>.</p>



<p>As mentioned above, LastPass was no stranger to security incidents before this breach, but none were as shocking as this one. Customers of online password managers generally trust that their service is safeguarded enough that their data&mdash;even if encrypted&mdash;can&rsquo;t be accessed by unauthorized parties. Hearing after a breach that vault data was unencrypted was a bit blindsiding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And perhaps there&rsquo;s good reason from an engineering perspective for why some details&mdash;like URLs, how often you use an entry, when you last updated an entry, etc&mdash;would not be encrypted. But that brings us to the second way LastPass skewered my trust in them, which is&hellip;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="bad-communication">Bad communication</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="LastPass password iteration upgrade email" class="wp-image-2014053" height="977" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lastpass2.png" width="838" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>So, obviously, I don&rsquo;t know what it takes to run a business where you&rsquo;re not only safeguarding really sensitive info, but you&rsquo;re actively dealing with threats to that info on a regular basis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But good communication is pretty basic, immediacy and full transparency go a long way. A healthy dose of preemptive notifications works wonders, too. The way LastPass breaks its news to customers could use a lot of improvement on all three fronts.</p>



<p>Let&rsquo;s take a recent example. In mid-July, I logged in to make a last check of the account I was abandoning, only to see a message that my password iterations had been raised to 600,000.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A higher number of password iterations is in theory a good thing. It&rsquo;s supposed to help slow down the ability to quickly guess what your password is. Modern cryptography standards recommends 600,000 iterations, which is probably why LastPass chose to boost customers universally to that level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But this happened in July 2023. That is, six months after the disclosure in December about everyone&rsquo;s vault data being stolen. A half year passed in which people who did not check that setting back in December (like I did) and increased it (like I also did) were left with much lower iterations (like mine was before I fiddled with it).</p>



<p>It says a lot that my first thought was, &ldquo;<em>What kind of security issue did they have </em>this time<em> to prompt this?</em>&rdquo; Also, that my second one was, &ldquo;<em>Why is this happening now?</em>&rdquo;</p>



<p>The email explaining this change came several hours after I made a quick online search to figure out just what the heck was going on. Then another copy came in the next day. The contents did not explain the timing nor the motivating reason behind the increase.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-web-interface-is-disappointing">The web interface is disappointing</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="LastPass web interface" class="wp-image-2014076" height="542" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lastpass3.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>Once upon a time, LastPass&rsquo;s web interface was reasonably decent. Maybe not the slickest, but it felt modern enough.</p>



<p>Nowadays, it feels much more bare-bones compared to rival password managers. Small changes over time has degraded the web interface, too. My biggest beef is that it relies heavily on persistent cookies to maintain settings. Incognito browsing means that your layout will never remain saved&mdash;it always reverts the view to LastPass&rsquo;s default.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Banner messages appear repeatedly, too. Perhaps this is petty of me, but when a permanent banner message appeared for the browser extension appeared, that was when I finally reached my limit. LastPass has the logs of what devices I&rsquo;ve used and my consistent, unrelenting use of the web interface for years and years. Being nagged persistently is not going to make me change that habit.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="exporting-your-vault-is-a-nightmare">Exporting your vault is a nightmare</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="LastPass export confirmation email" class="wp-image-2014081" height="560" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lastpass4.png" width="845" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Strangely, exporting through web interface requires going through a verification process, but the browser extension will cough up the CSV immediately.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>This section was filled with far saltier language until I remembered you all (and my editor) would be reading it. Roll up your sleeves, because we&rsquo;re getting into the dirty details with this one.</p>



<p>You&rsquo;d think that perhaps, if you were leaving a service, the business would be incentivized to make the process as easy as possible&mdash;thereby increasing the chances you might return someday. LastPass tries for this, but it doesn&rsquo;t do it consistently. And lucky me, I got caught up in whatever development hole that allows for sloppy password exports.</p>



<p>Generally, when you switch password managers, you&rsquo;ll export your vault data to a CSV or XML file. They&rsquo;re basic file formats that can be easily read across different programs (in theory, anyway). LastPass only exports to CSV for this purpose and the defining characteristic of the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values&amp;xcust=2-1-2013960-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">comma separated values</a> format is that (as you&rsquo;d expect from the name), commas are used to indicate separate data fields.</p>



<p><em>Note: If exporting all your passwords to an unencrypted format like CSV or XML, saving it to </em><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/549444/how-to-encrypt-files-in-windows.html"><em>an encrypted folder on your PC</em></a><em> will help safeguard them as you transition between LastPass and a new password manager.</em></p>



<p>I want to be clear&mdash;I&rsquo;m the kind of person that if something goes wonky, I like to understand why. And when my export came out a mess, with a bunch of entries containing orphaned data, I tried to make sense of what I was seeing.</p>



<p>At first, I thought the root cause was commas in the text fields. That perhaps they were causing entries to be split up and read as different entries (with data ending in the wrong fields, to boot). But that didn&rsquo;t explain why some entries with no commas at all got split up. Or why other entries were just plain missing.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="LastPass partial export from web interface" class="wp-image-2014087" height="172" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/export.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This export through the web interface keeps commas in the right places, but three entries in this test account are missing in the CSV file. The browser extension properly exports them all.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>I still had no clear answers by the time I finished manually cross-checking every single entry against the originals in LastPass, a necessary evil because the data was untrustworthy, but importing and cleaning up the mess was still faster than creating all the entries from scratch in the new password manager.</p>



<p>Trying different browsers and methods of export (i.e., initiated through the web interface vs the browser extension) didn&rsquo;t clear up the confusion. Turns out the web interface does not export all entries (Firefox) or straight up returns a blank CSV file (Chrome), but both Firefox&rsquo;s web interface export and the Chrome browser extension had the same issues with data integrity. Meanwhile, when I tried exporting on a test account, the data fields for each entry came out perfect (even if some were still missing in the web export).</p>



<p>As best as I can tell, either the age of the account influences how the data is stored and parsed on the servers, or the use of certain special characters in non-password text fields triggers some kind of bug in the export script. Either way, you can&rsquo;t trust you&rsquo;re actually getting all your passwords out intact. Hours into the tedious process of salvaging my import, I seriously considered abandoning the process in favor of password resets for every service, and letting the new password manager capture them. I mean, I was going to have to do that anyway as a final precaution given the LastPass security breaches, right?</p>



<p><strong>Never again.</strong></p>

</div>


<p>Lenovo&rsquo;s X1 Nano, now in its third generation, aims to cram an enjoyable and performant laptop into the smallest footprint possible. That means it can&rsquo;t be <em>too small</em> (that would ruin the keyboard), but it still needs to look and feel smaller than its mainstream rivals. The X1 Nano meets this goal, though it requires a few compromises.</p>

</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-specs-and-features">Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Nano: Specs and features</h2>



<p>The Lenovo X1 Nano&rsquo;s name implies it&rsquo;s small&mdash;and that&rsquo;s correct. It measures less than a foot across and less than .58 inches thick. It&rsquo;s also light, weighing a mere 2.18 pounds.</p>



<ul>
<li>CPU: Intel Core i7-1360P</li>



<li>Memory: 16GB LPDDR5 6400</li>



<li>Graphics/GPU: Intel Iris Xe</li>



<li>Display: 13-inch 2,160 x 1,350 IPS touchscreen</li>



<li>Storage: 512GB PCIe Gen4 SSD</li>



<li>Webcam: 1080p&nbsp;</li>



<li>Connectivity:&nbsp; 2x Thunderbolt 4 / USB 4 with Power Delivery, DisplayPort Alternate Mode, 3.5mm combo audio</li>



<li>Networking: WiFi 6E, Bluetooth 5.2, optional Nano-SIM</li>



<li>Biometrics: Fingerprint reader, IR Camera for Windows Hello facial recognition&nbsp;</li>



<li>Battery capacity: 49.6 watt-hours</li>



<li>Dimensions: 11.54 x 8.19 x .58 inches</li>



<li>Weight: 2.18 pounds</li>



<li>MSRP: $1,217 base MSRP, $1,714 as-tested</li>
</ul>



<p>However, Lenovo still equips the X1 Nano with a relatively quick Core i7-1360P processor. The &ldquo;P&rdquo; is important&mdash;Intel&rsquo;s Core i7 P-Series processors are generally quicker than the U-Series, which can lead to some confusion (the Core i7-1365U, for example, is slightly slower, as it has fewer CPU cores and a lower maximum power draw). The X1 Nano also packs a healthy 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, with up to 1TB of storage available in top-tier configurations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-design-and-build-quality">Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Nano: Design and build quality</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img alt="Lenovo Nano build quality" class="wp-image-2017030" height="807" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-1-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1211" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>The Lenovo X1 Nano is a remarkably petite system even for a laptop with a 13-inch display. It&rsquo;s not as thin as Apple&rsquo;s MacBook Air 13, but smaller in both width and depth, and its footprint is a close match to the Dell XPS 13. But the X1 Nano&rsquo;s mere 2.18 pounds of weight makes it lighter than either by roughly half a pound. None of these laptops are heavy, of course, but the X1 Nano&rsquo;s relative lack of heft is noticeable in-hand.</p>



<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean the X1 Nano is fragile, however. It feels surprisingly rigid and sturdy with minimal flex along all body panels including the display, which just barely bends while opening and closing the laptop (the same is true of most competitors though, notably, the XPS 13 and MacBook Air 13 are stiff as a board). Lenovo boasts the laptop is MIL-STD-810H tested, and while this standard doesn&rsquo;t require third-party certification, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/thinkpad-milspec/?referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Flaptops%2Fthinkpad%2Fthinkpadx1%2Fthinkpad-x1-nano-gen-3-%2813-inch-intel%29%2Flen101t0054%3ForgRef%3Dhttps%25253A%25252F%25252Fduckduckgo.com%25252F&amp;xcust=2-1-2016999-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Lenovo at least mentions the 12 specific tests they perform</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As for the aesthetic, well&mdash;it&rsquo;s a ThinkPad. Lenovo occasionally deviates from the tried-and-true formula with inexpensive machines like the Lenovo ThinkBook, but ThinkPads are still ThinkPads: simple, black slabs with a grippy exterior and the classic red TrackPoint nub in the center of the keyboard. It&rsquo;s not attractive, to be sure, but it remains distinctive and offers a more rugged, workmanlike alternative to the showy <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1355530/dell-xps-13-9315-review.html">Dell XPS 13</a> and Apple MacBook Air 13.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-keyboard-trackpad">Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Nano: Keyboard, trackpad</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Nano keyboard" class="wp-image-2017060" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>Lenovo has a reputation for excellent keyboards, and the X1 Nano doesn&rsquo;t disappoint. It delivers a surprisingly spacious layout and large, easy-to-find keys that are excellent for touch typing. Only a few keys along the edges, such as Backspace, are smaller than usual.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Key feel is great, too, with reasonable travel and a firm, crisp bottoming action. It&rsquo;s not quite as good as what&rsquo;s found on larger, thicker ThinkPads, but I prefer it to the keyboard found on Dell&rsquo;s XPS 13 (which, to be clear, is good&mdash;but not this good). The ThinkPad X1 Nano&rsquo;s key feel is a close match to the Apple MacBook Air 13 M2, which also has a firm, clicky keyboard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A classic Lenovo touchpad with Trackpoint provides mouse navigation. It has an unusual design with physically separated left, right, and center mouse buttons just below the space. These buttons are meant for use with the Trackpoint nub in the center of the keyboard: when using it, they fall immediately under your thumb.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether you like this depends on your thoughts on the Trackpoint. Lenovo&rsquo;s red nub lets you use the mouse without shifting your hands away from the keyboard, but the Trackpoint is more sensitive and touchy than a touchpad. This design also reduces the physical size of the touchpad, which is more narrow than what you&rsquo;ll find on the Dell XPS 13, Apple MacBook AIr 13, or <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1927897/asus-zenbook-s-13-oled-review.html">Asus Zenbook S 13 OLED</a>. Put simply&mdash;the Trackpoint is great, but the touchpad feels cramped.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-display-audio">Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Nano: Display, audio</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Nano hero" class="wp-image-2017026" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>The Lenovo X1 Nano offers two display options. Both use an IPS display panel and have an unusual 2,160 x 1,350 resolution, but buyers have the option to add touchscreen support. I received the touchscreen, which also has an &ldquo;anti-glare, anti-smudge&rdquo; finish, but the two displays should perform similarly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Choosing an IPS display leads to several weaknesses and one strength. First, the strength: the X1 Nano&rsquo;s display is extremely bright with a maximum of 472 nits. That&rsquo;s towards the high end for a laptop display and, when combined with the anti-reflective coat, it makes for a display that&rsquo;s usable in nearly any situation. That&rsquo;s an important trait for a small, portable laptop like the X1 Nano, since it&rsquo;s likely to be used in a corporate office, airport, and other brightly lit spaces.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the display&rsquo;s performance otherwise disappoints. It provides a contrast ratio of just 1690:1 and spans just 78 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut. Neither result is bad, but many modern laptops have turned towards OLED displays that, though not as bright, provide superior image quality in both entertainment and content creation. I can understand why Lenovo stuck a bright IPS display for the X1 Nano, but the trade-off in image quality is noticeable when it&rsquo;s time to kick back, relax, and watch some Netflix.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Audio quality is mediocre, though it remains acceptable for a laptop this size. The speakers&rsquo; maximum volume is only loud enough to fill a small, quiet office with sound, and the lack of low-end oomph saps drama from music and movies. Dialogue remains clear, at least.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-webcam-microphone-biometrics">Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Nano: Webcam, microphone, biometrics</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Nano webcam" class="wp-image-2017057" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>A 1080p webcam with built-in physical privacy shutter slips into the Lenovo X1 Nano&rsquo;s top bezel. It&rsquo;s a solid camera, providing a crisp, clear, vibrant image even in dim interior lighting. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it for launching a YouTube career, of course, but it&rsquo;s great for video calls.</p>



<p>The same can be said of the microphone array. It picks up extremely strong, clear dialogue even when the laptop is several feet away, or when not looking directly at the laptop. Noise cancellation was also solid, as the microphone was able to filter out the sound of my typing and (usually) minimized the annoyance of a nearby barking dog.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lenovo offers two forms of biometric login: a fingerprint reader and an IR camera with support for facial recognition login. I personally prefer to use facial recognition over a fingerprint reader, but it&rsquo;s nice to have an option.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-connectivity">Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Nano: Connectivity</h2>



<p>The ThinkPad X1 Nano aggressively leans into Thunderbolt 4 and USB 4. It offers two such ports, both of which support Power Delivery (for charging the laptop) and DisplayPort Alternate Mode&mdash;and, aside from a 3.5mm combo audio jack, that&rsquo;s all the ports you get.</p>



<p>This isn&rsquo;t a surprise, given the laptop&rsquo;s size and its competition. Most small, light, and expensive laptops opt for Thunderbolt 4 and USB 4, as they provide a wide range of connectivity in a handful of small, easy-to-use ports. Still, shoppers who need to connect with older peripherals should be wary. A Thunderbolt 4 / USB 4 dock or hub will be required.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ethernet is missing, but the X1 Nano goes all-in on wireless connectivity with support for Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.1, and an optional Nano-SIM slot for 4G LTE connectivity. The X1 Nano I tested didn&rsquo;t have the Nano-SIM installed, but Wi-FI performance was excellent. I saw sustained speeds up to the limit of my Gigabit Internet connection when using the laptop in the same room as the router. I saw speeds of up to 120 Mbps in my external office, which is located 50 feet and several walls away from my router, and had no issues with the Wi-Fi connection&rsquo;s reliability in this (or any other) location.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-performance">Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Nano: Performance</h2>



<p>The Lenovo X1 Nano is small on the outside, but its hardware is similar to many thin-and-light laptops with larger displays (like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2000409/lg-gram-superslim-review.html">LG Gram SuperSlim</a>). It has an Intel Core i7-1360P processor with a total of 12 cores (four performance cores and eight efficient cores) and a maximum Turbo boost speed of 5GHz. All models come with 16GB of RAM (which isn&rsquo;t user-serviceable, as it&rsquo;s soldered to the mainboard) and a PCIe Gen 4 solid state drive.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Nano PCMark results" class="wp-image-2017065" height="762" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-pcmark.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>Intel&rsquo;s Core i7-1360P performs well in the Lenovo X1 Nano and led the laptop to a score of 5,654 in PCMark 10. That&rsquo;s an excellent score for a laptop with Intel Iris Xe graphics (as graphics performance is a factor in this test).</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Nano Cinebench results" class="wp-image-2017067" height="751" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-cinebench.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>The Lenovo X1 Nano&rsquo;s performance in Cinebench R15, a benchmark that relies on multi-threaded processor performance over a short duration, was more muted. It achieved a score of 1,717 which, although not bad, does place the X1 Nano behind the Framework Laptop 13. And Lenovo&rsquo;s own Slim 7 Pro with Ryzen 7735HS once again jets ahead of the Intel pack with a score of 1,938.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Nano 3DMark results" class="wp-image-2017068" height="752" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-3dmark.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>It&rsquo;s wise not to expect much from the Lenovo X1 Nano&rsquo;s graphics. It relies on Intel&rsquo;s aging Iris Xe, which achieves a score of 1,715 in 3DMark Time Spy. This is typical for a laptop with Intel Iris Xe, but it&rsquo;s not impressive compared to even entry-level discrete graphics, which can achieve a score several times higher.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Lenovo X1 Nano&rsquo;s overall performance is solid. The Intel Core i7-1360P does well and gives the Nano an advantage over competitors that stick with less performant Intel Core i5 and i7 U-Series processors. The lack of discrete graphics is a downside, but it&rsquo;s unreasonable to expect a 13-inch, 2.18 pound Windows laptop to deliver strong graphics performance. Those who want to play 3D games, or use a GPU to accelerate a specific app, will need to buy a larger laptop. And, that limitation aside, the Lenovo X1 Nano is a capable machine that can handle not only basic productivity (like Word and Excel) but also some more demanding tasks, like photo editing and 1080p video editing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-battery-life">Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Nano: Battery life</h2>



<p>While Lenovo provides good performance in a small package, it had to make tough decisions about the battery. Larger batteries take up more space and add more weight, so Lenovo sticks with a small 49.6 watt-hour battery. That&rsquo;s not a large battery for a modern Windows laptop, and it unfortunately leads to modest battery life.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Nano battery life" class="wp-image-2017071" height="755" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-battery-life.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>I saw seven hours and 10 minutes of battery life in PC World&rsquo;s standard battery test, which loops a 4K file of the short film <em>Tears of Steel</em>. Real-world use was similar, as I saw the battery dip by almost half in one three and a half-hour long browsing session that made moderate use of browser tabs. That&rsquo;s not enough to nudge the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Nano through a full workday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lenovo shipped my X1 Nano with the standard 65-watt USB-C charge I&rsquo;ve found with other Lenovo laptops. It&rsquo;s a bad fit for a small, light laptop. Stranger still, Lenovo itself sells a smaller 65-watt GaN power brick, <em>and</em> it&rsquo;s less expensive on Lenovo&rsquo;s store. Lenovo would do well to start shipping the GaN power brick instead of the larger, standard power brick.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-should-you-buy-it">Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Nano: Should you buy it?</h2>



<p>The Lenovo X1 Nano is a good option for business professionals, frequent fliers, and other on-the-go users who don&rsquo;t want the burden of a large, heavy laptop. The X1 Nano is both small and light yet it still offers an excellent keyboard and speedy processor performance. Battery life is the laptop&rsquo;s most serious flaw, and it could prove a problem if travel often leaves you without access to a power outlet. If you can work around that problem, though, the X1 Nano will prove a capable, portable machine.&nbsp;</p>
