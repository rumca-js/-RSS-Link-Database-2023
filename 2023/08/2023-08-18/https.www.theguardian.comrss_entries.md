<p>This sweet funny feature debut from Johnny Barrington set on the Isle of Lewis with shades of The Banshees of Inisherin has been chosen to open the Edinburgh film festival</p><p>Skye-born film-maker Johnny Barrington got a Bafta nomination in 2013 for his short film <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6XOT0ZO5GA">Tumult</a> and now he opens the Edinburgh film festival with his feature debut: a whimsical coming-of-age drama with a touch of Bill Forsyth, set on the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides. It is a beautiful, remote landscape whose sweeping emptiness is interestingly used by Barrington and his director of photography Ruben Woodin Dechamps as a blank canvas for gentle flights of fancy.</p><p>The result is a likeable, sweet-natured and often funny film, though straying a bit close to away-with-the-fairies tweeness and a bit uncertain on the subject of whether organised religion is bad or not. Louis McCartney and Ella Lily Hyland give very intelligent and sympathetic performances as Dondo and Sas, two high-school kids in the little town of Uig. Dondo lives with his widowed mum Veronica (Victoria Balnaves), in unresolved grief since his fisherman dad was lost at sea one year before, with the body never found. Sas is a very smart girl hoping to study medicine, idly strumming her electric guitar while gazing at a poster of Jimi Hendrix and realising, a little to her chagrin, that she might have feelings for Dondo, her childhood mate, interestingly weird, and obsessed with surfing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/18/silent-roar-review-charming-coming-of-age-tale-of-existential-angst-and-surfing">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A narrow opening win against Wolves was an acceptable start to the season but Erik ten Hag still has plenty to consider</p><p>Manchester United and Erik ten Hag started the season with a home victory in front of a packed Old Trafford but it was a performance that gave them plenty to ponder rather than a platform. The last campaign began with two defeats and much outcry about whether Ten Hag could turn things around and the atmosphere felt flat on Monday after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/14/manchester-united-wolves-premier-league-match-report" title="">beating Wolves</a>. It was thoroughly undeserved and slightly more clinical opponents would have been out of sight. A trip to Spurs on Saturday evening should provide a fascinating barometer of where United stand.</p><p>The way Wolves’ Matheus Cunha glided through a nonexistent midfield is a cause for concern. Casemiro was brought in last summer to provide the steel needed to remove a soft underbelly but he was often left to put out fires alone on Monday, with the new pairing of Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount ahead of him.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/18/manchester-united-tottenham-premier-league-preview">Continue reading...</a>

<p>England captain scored and set up Sane’s opener in 4-0 win at Werder Bremen to launch quest for Bundesliga trophy in style</p><p>Welcome to Harry Kane, Bundesliga. Amid the kind of feverish, pyrotechnic atmosphere he rarely experienced in England, this was a lesson in what Bayern Munich’s league debutant knows better than almost anyone. He will not care that his 74th minute goal, the second in a straightforward win, took a slight deflection off Amos Pieper on its way; nor will he care that Leroy Sané, whose opener he set up deftly, tops their early scoring charts. In the breaking of a duck, the shaking away of any approaching monkey, Kane showed at least one major trophy should be perfectly within his grasp.</p><p>That will be a certainty if all his domestic opponents are as weak as Werder Bremen, likely relegation candidates whose winless run against Bayern now extends 15 years. But this was the kind of bedding-in, a smooth and frictionless showing in a setting with a marked sense of place, that Kane would have craved. The past week has flown by but, a few ripples apart, it was hard to see a future in which he and his new teammates’ radars fail to align.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/18/harry-kane-hits-ground-running-with-bayern-munich-in-cruise-control">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Summerhall, Edinburgh<br /></strong>The three dancers portray arrestingly clear images of women on high alert, but a potent performance is marred at times by scrappiness and muddy rhythms</p><p>The choreographer Amina Khayyam was not supposed to be dancing at the fringe, but she stepped in at the last minute to replace another dancer in her company, and some of the most powerful moments of Bird belong to her. But the performance itself seems to have been tipped off centre by this late substitution. It is full of potential but still undercooked.</p><p>Khayyam is a Slough-based choreographer deeply engaged with social issues, often building works from real-life stories that come up during community workshops. She uses Kathak, a form of classical Indian dance, to tackle hard-hitting subjects such as childlessness, acid attacks against women, the plight of refugees, and struggles with sexuality. In lockdown, she made a film Catch the Bird Who Won’t Fly, about women living with domestic abuse, and this show continues that theme.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/18/bird-review-fear-punctuates-the-fluid-dancing-in-this-tale-of-domestic-violence">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Assembly @ Dance Base, Edinburgh<br /></strong>Mushroom coffins, organic wool shrouds and funeral re-enactments pepper Solène Weinachter’s light touch but poignant show</p><p>Sinatra, T Rex, pan pipe muzak: what will be the soundtrack to your funeral? Who will be there? What will they say? When Solène Weinachter was unexpectedly cajoled into dancing at her uncle Bob’s cremation, she found herself pondering these very questions, and she has turned those thoughts into a surprisingly upbeat piece of dance-theatre on mortality and remembrance.<br /><br />The French-born Weinachter is known as a member of <a href="https://www.scottishdancetheatre.com/">Scottish Dance Theatre</a>, and for working with Ben Duke and his company Lost Dog, especially playing Juliet in the table-turning <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/feb/19/juliet-and-romeo-review-ben-duke-battersea-arts-centre">Juliet &amp; Romeo</a>. After All is not a million miles away in tone from Duke’s dance theatre work, in the way it uses a light touch and self-effacing personality but swerves into deeper themes.</p><p>Weinachter is confidently warm and funny, in command of her material. That material is mostly text, peppered with telling details, such as the aunt whose green eyeshadow matches the colour of her scarf. But it is delivered in the way only a physical performer could, with dance an extension of her words, energy and often goofy tone.<br /><br />What starts as a tight monologue unravels more loosely into a journey into modern funeral mores, complete with mushroom coffins and organic wool shrouds, alongside musings on the need to be remembered. Weinachter cycles through emotions – a fake home video is surprisingly poignant, loneliness and childlessness are briefly touched on – but is always quick to find a laugh. She shares the stage with sign language interpreter Yvonne Strain, an integral part of the performance, who demonstrates some comic timing of her own.<br /><br />Weinachter tells us she loves “tasty” beginnings, bursting with possibility, but she hates endings, setting up some jeopardy over whether she will land the big finish here. It works, but there is probably more to explore in this piece as a whole, a way of really pulling the rug from underneath that jokey exterior. At one point, she almost loses us when she goes off on a crying spree, then very knowingly describes exactly the feelings we have just been experiencing. We see Weinachter “acting” vulnerable, but maybe not being vulnerable. This is a cleverly entertaining piece with the makings of something even better.<br /><br />• At <a href="https://assemblyfestival.com/whats-on/after-all">Assembly @ Dance Base, Edinburgh</a>, until 27 August<br />• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/edinburgh-festival-2023+tone/reviews">All our Edinburgh festival reviews</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/18/after-all-review-a-goofy-whirl-of-remembrance">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Brazilian’s move to Al-Hilal is end of his meaningful career but I have adored watching his limitless beauty as a footballer</p><p>Bittersweet memories. That is all I’m taking with me. So goodbye. Please don’t cry. We both know, I’m not … Ah. Sorry. It’s fine. Just a little dusty in here.</p><p>When it comes to Neymar and I, me and Ney, the feelings, the farewells, the deeply personal – I’m going to say it – love story of the last 13 years (legal clarification: Neymar has no idea who I am) I feel a lot closer to the Dolly Parton original version right now – rueful, sad, fondly heartbroken – as opposed to the Whitney Houston super-cover: sad but also defiant, hopeful, liberated and ultimately the banshee nemesis of the final chorus, where I Will Always Love You has become <em>I am going to hunt you down and murder you with a scythe</em>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/aug/18/neymar-creative-genius-al-hilal-saudi-arabia">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Babies’ lives could have been saved if doctors’ concerns had been heeded at the Countess of Chester hospital</p><p>The crimes for which Lucy Letby has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/18/lucy-letby-found-guilty-of-murdering-seven-babies-at-chester-hospital" title="">found guilty</a> at Manchester crown court rank among the most appalling that any jury has confronted. Working as a children’s nurse at the Countess of Chester hospital, Letby used its neonatal unit as a killing field between June 2015 and June 2016.</p><p>Seizing opportunities when she was left alone with an infant, Letby murdered seven babies and attempted to kill another six. She deliberately preyed on premature and sick newborns, whose sudden, unexpected deaths could be more easily explained away. Her methods included injecting the infants with insulin, overfeeding with milk, and tampering with feeding tubes. One baby girl was finally murdered at the fourth attempt. Two of those who survived were left severely disabled. In the prosecution’s words, Letby was “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/18/lucy-letby-the-beige-and-average-nurse-who-turned-into-a-baby-killer#:~:text=The%20description%20by%20the%20prosecutor,more%20than%2050%20years%20ago." title="">cold, calculated, cruel and relentless</a>”.

<p>Australia and New Zealand have provided a tournament that has showcased the strength in depth of football across all continents</p><p>Four years ago, the 2019 Fifa Women’s World Cup, won by the US, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b21e7e26-76a1-11e9-be7d-6d846537acab" title="">was hailed</a> as a pinnacle moment for women’s football. The accolade was deserved. But if 2019 was a pinnacle, what can be said about this year’s even more remarkable contest? The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/15/seismic-impact-of-womens-world-cup-could-be-even-greater-than-euro-2022" title="">2023 World Cup</a> reaches a peak in Sydney on Sunday, when England and Spain face each other in the final. Yet if the contest over the last month proves one big thing, it is that, in women’s football, every pinnacle and peak still conceals another even higher one than the summit just reached.</p><p>The achievements of 2023 go beyond even England’s understandable delight and excitement at reaching – and hopefully winning – a first football World Cup final since the men’s now long distant victory in 1966. The most important of these wider successes is this tournament’s wonderful confirmation of real strength in depth in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/womens-world-cup-2023" title="">women’s game</a> on every continent. Although two European sides will contest the final, the global attainment gap is everywhere narrowing. Australia, Colombia and Japan deservedly reached the last eight (and Australia went further). Jamaica and Nigeria came close to joining them. China, Morocco, the Philippines, South Africa and Zambia all won group stage games. It can only be a matter of time before an African, Asian, Caribbean or Oceanian team gets to the final.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/18/the-guardian-view-on-the-womens-world-cup-the-best-so-far">Continue reading...</a>

Like others ill-served by unfettered clericalism, she has every right to voice her experiences, a right enshrined in canon law. For too long, most Catholics – pastorally minded clergy and theologians among them – have been expected to keep silent. Meanwhile, those with power (almost exclusively celibate, ordained men) have brought shame and guilt on themselves by remaining mute and complicit in the face of heinous acts.</p><p>Silence is no longer a valid option. Paul Simon reminds us that “silence like a cancer grows” – and these silences have inflicted untold damage on the authentic mission of the church.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/18/a-culture-of-silence-has-beset-catholicism-for-too-long">Continue reading...</a>

It was the moment the world woke up to exactly what England’s calm blue-eyed assassin could do.</p><p>Fast forward to July-August 2023 and Russo’s stock has risen rapidly while her role for the Lionesses has markedly changed. She spent the last tournament as the apprentice to Ellen White, used for impact off the bench in all their matches. Since the retirement of England’s record goalscorer, however, she has taken on the responsibility of a starting role, the focal point of Sarina Wiegman’s attack.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/18/alessia-russo-has-repaid-faith-with-a-flourish-to-keep-england-dreaming">Continue reading...</a>

Her message is stark, and a little wistful. “Hopefully we can do something good and get people back and in love with athletics.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/18/keely-hodgkinson-british-athletics-world-championships">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Springboks captain returns from the knee injury that was feared would rule him out of the tournament </p><p>There’s a reason NFL teams rarely, if ever, field their regular starters during the preseason. The risk of injury in a largely meaningless match is too great. Rugby union might want to copy from this playbook after a glut of star names, including France’s fly-half, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/14/france-suffer-major-world-cup-blow-after-romain-ntamack-ruled-out-of-tournament-rugby-union">Romain Ntamack</a>, and England’s in-form scrum-half, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/14/england-reshuffle-world-cup-pack-alex-mitchell-in-after-jack-van-poortvliet-exit-rugby-union">Jack van Poortvliet</a>, have pulled out of the World Cup after suffering cruel blows just weeks out from the tournament’s start.</p><p>Which is why the presence of Siya Kolisi at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff on Saturdaywill be a welcome sight to all rugby fans. The Springboks captain last played a competitive game 119 days ago when he was carried off the park in Durban when the Sharks hosted Munster in the United Rugby Championship. Scans showed that he had torn the ligaments in his right knee. There were fears he’d be an absent spectator when his team defended the Webb Ellis Cup.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/18/siya-kolisi-boost-as-springboks-take-on-wales-before-world-cup-defence-rugby-union">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It is right to hold an inquiry, but the hunt for ‘lessons to be learned’ and a system to blame can easily go too far</p><p>The agony of the death of a child is something most families these days will never suffer. Through illness, accident or even negligence, that loss, and the lifelong pain it causes, is every parent’s greatest fear, but to know someone murdered a defenceless infant must be beyond endurance. How could she?</p><p>We will never know what evil or insanity could have induced Lucy Letby to sweep away the lives of seven babies, and attempt the murder of another six. Everyone hearing the case of the worst serial killer of children in modern British history tries, and fails, to imagine the state of mind, the cause and how such a person grew up so apparently normal, her inner murderous impulses unobserved. Her responsibility for new lives inside the Countess of Chester hospital neonatal unit, which should be a sanctuary of the greatest safety, makes this feel like the deepest betrayal.</p><p>Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

You may recall that at the start of the men’s World Cup in Qatar last November, Infantino addressed “the west” – a hilariously self-effacing gesture that puts me in mind of a video that the actor Richard Gere once released on the eve of some Palestinian elections. “<a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/appeal-by-richard-gere-perplexes-palestinians/LH6GISGK7PNGFRRDLAVJLMSYJI/">Hi, I’m Richard Gere</a>,” this began, “and I’m speaking for the entire world.” Infantino was also covering a lot of bases last year in Qatar, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63687412">declaring</a>: “Today I have strong feelings. Today I feel Qatari, I feel Arab, I feel African, I feel gay, I feel disabled, I feel a migrant worker.” Oh dear.</p><p>Anyway, in the early hours of this morning, two days before England meet Spain in the final of a World Cup that has seen rapturous engagement, and record attendance and global viewing figures, Infantino announced he was addressing “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/18/gianni-infantino-urges-women-to-pick-the-right-battles-in-equal-pay-fight">all the women</a>”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/18/lionesses-let-down-men-gianni-infantino-explain-fight-battles">Continue reading...</a>

But Yepoka Yeebo’s contribution to the category stands out. Her meticulously researched Anansi’s Gold isn’t set in Silicon Valley or a swishy enclave such as Nantucket or Noto. Anansi’s Gold offers a tangled and mesmerizing history of Ghanaian-born John Ackah Blay-Miezah, architect of an Accra-based scam that American prosecutors called “one of the most fascinating – and lucrative – in modern history”.</p><p>The result of what the author calls a “six-year-long treasure hunt”, Anansi’s Gold involved countless hours at the library, trawls through hotel and military archives, and off-the-cuff conversations with Lyft drivers. Yeebo first heard about the story of Blay-Miezah when her mother sent her a video on WhatsApp showing a charismatic man who claimed to be the guardian of billions of dollars. “I was like, well, obviously not – that’s ridiculous,” Yeebo, 38, said by video call from her plant-filled apartment in London. “But every time I told a friend they were like, well, I’ve heard crazier stories. And I got obsessed with it.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/18/yepoka-yeebo-anansis-gold-ghanaian-conman">Continue reading...</a>

## What wine goes with fruit? | Fiona Beckett on drinks

<p>Some tips and tricks for matching – and contrasting – wines with varying fruit flavours</p><p>Given that most wine is loosely described as fruity, it might seem irrelevant to talk about which one works especially well with fruit. But think about it for a moment: for a start, no two fruits are the same, so a wine that tastes appley or citrussy (riesling, say) is a very different beast from one that tastes of plums (malbec or merlot, for example).</p><p>There’s also the difference between savoury and sweet. A savoury dish such as burrata with peaches will obviously call for a different wine than a peach cobbler or tart. And when you’re choosing a wine for sweet dishes, it’s more about handling the level of sweetness than mimicking the fruit flavour. In fact, you might even want a contrast – with <em>spaghetti al limone</em>, for instance, a light red such as valpolicella, frappato or the freisa d’Asti in today’s pick would work better than a lemony wine such as a sauvignon blanc. Lemon tart, meanwhile, is more about dealing with its exquisite sharpness, so a super-sweet ice wine will usually do the trick there.</p><p>For more wine pairings, go to Fiona’s website, <a href="http://matchingfoodandwine.com/">matchingfoodandwine.com</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/aug/18/what-wine-goes-with-fruit-fiona-beckett">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Thanks to the RFU stepping in to pay his wages, one of England’s top players will feature at the World Cup despite not having a club</p><p>Anthony Watson is used to his teammates treating him as the ‘special one’. As the solitary member of England’s World Cup side with unattached next to his name, the winger is in the unique position of being the only squad member employed by the Rugby Football Union rather than a club. “You know what it’s like with rugby players,” says Watson with a sigh, a touch wearily. “Very little goes unremarked.”</p><p>The jokes about extra food at lunchtime and his company-man status, however, mask a deeper, darker reality. Watson’s entire rugby future would have been on hold had the RFU not stepped in to pay his wages for this summer. “I would be lying if I said it wasn’t a stressful period,” he says quietly, gazing down at his fingernails. “There were definitely days when I was expected to play in big games and would be under a fair bit of stress outside rugby.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/18/anthony-watson-england-rugby-union-interview">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From traumatic experiences to pitiful pay, reality show cast members are sharing their horror stories. As Hollywood continues to strike, is now the time to demand change?</p><p>When Gemma Rose Barnes, 32, signed up to appear on Married at First Sight (Mafs) – a reality TV show that introduces couples for the first time on their wedding day – she felt apprehensive. She told the show’s producers that she wanted to meet the love of her life, and was worried she’d be married off to someone who hadn’t gone on the show for the same reason. “They told me that audiences now wanted to see genuine matches, so I had nothing to worry about,” says Barnes.</p><p>But what was sold to her as the chance to find The One quickly descended into a nightmare. Barnes says she made repeated complaints to the producers about her husband. When she asked to leave the show, she says she was coerced into staying – although Channel 4 claims that she was free to leave at any time. She says contestants were plied with alcohol, and that on one occasion producers snuck extra drinks to certain cast members before filming. Channel 4 denies this, claiming that alcohol consumption is at the discretion of individuals, “but it is monitored and limited by the production team”. Other contestants have <a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/reality-tv/a41083773/married-at-first-sight-uk-bob-alcohol-nikita/" title="">spoken of being “smashed” during filming after sneaking in bottles of alcohol</a>, as well as <a href="https://thetab.com/uk/2022/09/29/how-much-alcohol-are-the-couples-allowed-on-married-at-first-sight-uk-275948" title="">dramatic arguments being sparked by participants drinking on an empty stomach</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/aug/18/we-wont-take-this-any-more-reality-tv-stars-battle-to-unionise">Continue reading...</a>

## A break from the past: Final Fantasy XVI’s composer on ushering in a new era

<p>Masayoshi Soken has quietly ripped up the rulebook for the latest edition of Square Enix’s epic series</p><p>“If we have to bring the old world crashing down in order to build us a new one,” says Cid, Final Fantasy XVI’s gravel-voiced deuteragonist in the first act of the game, “what say you? Are you with me?”</p><p>Cid delivers this dramatic line as a musical refrain that any Final Fantasy player will recognise ascends and descends ominously in the background. It’s the most recent interpretation of the series’ famous Prelude, originally played by a simple digital harp working its way up and down a scale. Legend has it that this number was a last-minute addition to the very first game in the series (more than 35 years ago) by composer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2015/apr/07/nobuo-uematsu-video-game-composer-shaking-classical-music">Nobuo Uematsu</a>. It took about 10 minutes to create, and has since been performed by orchestras all over the world, and used in the games bearing the indomitable Final Fantasy brand.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/aug/18/final-fantasy-xvi-composer-masayoshi-soken">Continue reading...</a>

Family weddings, birthday parties, leavers’ prom – you name it. Whether I actually needed it is, of course, up for debate. And yet the confidence that came with that first pair from M&amp;S, bought with guidance (though not insistence) from my mother, convinced me to keep wriggling into them long before anyone came up with the idea that shapewear didn’t need to be ugly or – worse – uncomfortable. Back then, it was both – but somehow it made me<em> feel</em> more comfortable with my blossoming frame.</p><p>Now, I wear it on a weekly basis. When I’m shopping for a dress, I’ll even pick something with the understanding that shapewear will help “finesse” things. And by that, I mean smoothing – not sucking, or making me smaller. Instead, the idea is to even out lumps and bumps to offer up a more “precise” silhouette.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/aug/17/compression-not-suppression-fashions-growing-addiction-to-shapewear">Continue reading...</a>

## Lorna Rose Treen: Skin Pigeon review – dolphins, vamps and Brownies join dotty parade

Chortle’s best newcomer. Lorna Rose Treen has amassed a few awards already in her short career, and there’s buzz around her maiden fringe show. I’d say deservedly so – with a few caveats. Skin Pigeon is a dotty character-comedy anthology, situated so far leftfield as to risk entanglement in the hedgerow. Treen has fashioned for her set an overflowing laundry heap, from which to emerge head-first like Winnie in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jul/02/happy-days-review-siobhan-mcsweeney-brings-masterful-touch-to-becketts-masterpiece">Happy Days</a>, in character as this or that oddball personality: a chain-smoking film noir vamp; a maniacal door-stepper; a dolphin recognising itself in the mirror.</p><p>We’re not in the realm of fully-rounded characters here: that’s not what Treen’s doing. They’re more like wonky cartoons, pitched at a sharp angle to the real world, and all invested with Treen’s pleasure, faintly defiant, at modelling her dressing-up box onstage. Sometimes, I found her ideas for characters, and the bold brushstrokes with which she brings them to life, more impressive than the jokes. And while you can see why she’d want to vary the rhythm with a few blink-and-you-miss-them personae, there are one or two who feel throwaway or in want of development.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/18/lorna-rose-treen-review-skin-pigeon-pleasance-courtyard">Continue reading...</a>

Using multiple disguises, Heather hides out in a variety of locations in Scotland, Norway and Iceland, with the story taking us back and forth in time until we understand what has brought her to this point: her mysterious father; her army career; the severing of her most important and enduring friendship; the bad decisions that led her into jeopardy, and her essential aloneness. The “hunted woman” narrative is certainly pacey and propulsive, but A Bird in Winter is also a compelling study of trust, and the contradictory desire both to escape and to be found.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/18/the-best-recent-and-thrillers-review-roundup">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The dessert list, especially, is complex and surprising, which are two words rarely used in pudding-land these days</p><p>When a place such as <a href="https://mountainbeakstreet.com/">Mountain</a> opens, I can almost hear the grinding teeth of rival restaurateurs, because every new <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tomos_pp/">Tomos Parry</a> restaurant creates a gasping hubbub that you cannot manufacture or pay for. Parry rarely appears on TV, he doesn’t have a string of cookbooks, neither does he go on tour, as James Martin does, and play Money For Nothing on an electric guitar between recipe demos (the fervour around Parry’s breakthrough restaurant, <a href="https://bratrestaurant.co.uk/">Brat in Shoreditch</a>, would have allowed it, though). Instead, somewhere among the Basque-style turbot, the smoked potatoes and the wobbly cheesecake, diners and food critics alike developed a deep respect for Parry. It wasn’t hype, either: Brat is exemplary. Four years after opening, it is still <em>the</em> place to get a table, especially if you want to signal to your guest: “I know what I am doing.”</p><p>And now we have Mountain in Soho, a bigger space set over two floors, with more cooking on fire, more muted, industrial-rustic decor, more painstakingly sourced ingredients such as ex-dairy beef and sobrassada. The menu is a tad more experimental, though, with Tamworth sow collar, turbot head and <a href="https://butcherybowhouse.com/our-meat/aged-cull-ewe-mutton/#:~:text=referring%20to%20the%20fact%20that%20these%20were%20lamb%20producing%20animals%20who%20have%20for%20whatever%20reason%20stopped%20producing.">cull yaw </a>chops, as well as beef sweetbreads with violet artichokes, spider crab omelette and nutty walnut bread with peach and bottarga, which is one of the most delicious things I’ve eaten this year. Would I, of my own volition, layer wafer-thin slices of ripe peach on to walnut bread and add pungent, salty, smoked fish roe? No, it sounds horrific.

<p>Rumours abound that the pop star may be cast as Dazzler, a superhero pop star who transforms sound into light and energy beams, in the upcoming Deadpool 3</p><p>Strange things are happening in the geekosphere. Over the past week, there’s been a flurry of activity on Twitter (AKA X) and the internet generally surrounding Taylor Swift’s <a href="https://www.giantfreakinrobot.com/ent/taylor-swift-marvel-dazzler.html">reported casting (in cameo) as Dazzler in the Marvel movie Deadpool 3</a>. Is it really happening? The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV6HBYjbx1k">original video report by Disinsider</a> that sparked a ream of stories and posts now seems to have excised all references to the singer’s apparent appearance, so we’ll probably have to wait until 2024 to find out.</p><p>For the record, Dazzler seems like the perfect fit for Swift. A superhero pop star capable of transforming sound into light and energy beams, she first appeared in the 1980 comic The Uncanny X-Men #130, looking like a disco queen from the stars in tight silver-white spandex and blue mini-mask. The singer’s casting would be an undoubted publicity coup for Marvel, given Swift’s billions of fans across the globe among pretty much all demographics. Moreover, Ryan Reynolds himself has p<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ryan-reynolds-taylor-swift-deadpool-3-cameo-theories-3345581">reviously said he would love to cast Spotify’s most-streamed female artist in a movie</a>, though it has to be said that similarly pitched stunt-casting hasn’t always worked out in the past.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/18/is-taylor-swift-joining-harry-styles-in-the-marvel-cinematic-universe">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With the evocative scent of an English summer, it will thrive in a dry sunny spot with minimal watering, and is bound to attract bees</p><p>It’s funny how our pasts catch up with us. I grew up in a house that looked out on to the main thoroughfare of the village. From the kitchen you could see people doing the school run or popping to see a friend. Between the window and the pavement was a small flower bed, the size of the kitchen table, which my mum filled with lavender. In high summer it hummed with bees and was ruffled by the hands of passersby trying to catch a whiff.</p><p>This might have been what was going on when, last April, I bought a tray of lavender plants from east London’s Columbia Road market after lunch at a friend’s and plonked them, slightly heady with red wine, into the gravel of our front yard. A year and a season later and they have filled out tremendously: big long spires, pale purple drumsticks, a delirious number of bees.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/aug/18/lavender-is-a-fragrant-low-effort-addition-to-your-garden-if-you-plant-it-correctly">Continue reading...</a>

However, the ongoing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jul/14/the-hollywood-actors-strike-everything-you-need-to-know">Sag-Aftra strike</a> means actors are not currently promoting their work, and so it is that I enter a Zoom call with Josh Greenbaum, the film’s director.

<p>New missions, a fresh 3v3v3 mode and an update of the popular zombie killing side game, Activision is going full bore for what could  be John Price’s last stand</p><p>As well timed as any real-life military operation, when autumn approaches, Activision reveals a new Call of Duty title. On Thursday night, the publisher announced Modern Warfare III, the latest (and last?) in its series of military shooters reimagining the trio of hugely successful Modern Warfare titles from the early 2010s. The game will launch on 10 November, on PC, PlayStation and Xbox with development led by Sledgehammer Games, which worked on the original Modern Warfare III with series originator, Infinity Ward.</p><p>Acting as a direct sequel to last year’s Modern Warfare II reboot, the game will see dramatically moustached hero John Price and his Task Force 141 taking on long-running antagonist Vladimir Makarov, very much the Moriarty of Russian ultra nationalism. The Campaign mode will feature new Open Combat Missions, which offer players various routes and options depending on their preferred play styles.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/aug/18/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-ready-for-action">Continue reading...</a>

And the reason why you, as a player, revisit her memories is to find out that, actually, she’s doing the right thing.”</p><p>Matkovski was born in Moldova but now lives in Transylvania in Romania, where his studio, Stoneskip, is based. “The studio itself was born around this project,” he says. “The origin of the game was simply me experimenting with 3D art.” In the midst of the Covid pandemic, Matkovski idly began recreating the room he was stuck in as a 3D model, then posted his progress online.

For her fifth album, however, the 27-year-old – real name Jasmine van den Bogaerde (she is Dirk Bogarde’s great-niece) – edges towards the zeitgeist, trading her hooky, all-purpose sentimentality for songs that draw on the current vogue for 80s-flavoured pop.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/18/birdy-portraits-review-irresistibly-melodic-80s-nostalgia-trip">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Drop is worse than expected as retailers say cost of living crisis still biting</p><p><strong>Stock markets have opened lower again.</strong></p><p>Germany’s Dax is down 0.5% at the opening bell, while France’s CAC and Italy’s FTSE MIB both fell 0.4% and Spain’s Ibex slipped 0.3%. The FTSE 100 index in London has lost 34 points, or 0.5%, to 7,274.</p><p>And with sales in July well below the second-quarter average, there appears to be a good chance that sales volumes could fall in the current quarter. But while the EY Item Club doesn’t think July’s particular weakness is wholly indicative of the outlook for retail, given the weather factor, subdued growth is likely to characterise the sector for the foreseeable future.</p><p>On the one hand, falling inflation and still-strong growth in cash pay mean average wages have finally started to rise again in real terms. Regarding price pressures, the latest retail release showed the annual rise in shop prices slowing to 4.3% in July, a 22-month low. Meanwhile, the financial position of households, in aggregate, is relatively healthy, reflecting unplanned savings accumulated during the pandemic and a paying down of unsecured debt in recent years.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/aug/18/retail-sales-in-britain-fall-12-as-wet-weather-hits-clothing-purchases-business-live">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Centre-back endured a difficult few years at Chelsea but is now fulfilling the potential she first showed as a teenager</p><p>“Do you want to play for your country?” Emma Hayes asked Jess Carter. It was the summer of 2019: two years since Carter’s form as an exciting teenager at Birmingham City had won her a single England cap and, later, a move to Chelsea. But in between times the young defender had lost her way a little. Her first season had gone badly. And her manager had had enough.</p><p>“I do, but not now,” Carter replied. “I’m not ready for it.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/18/england-womens-world-cup-jess-carter">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Tech bros are the new Knights of the Round Table in this whip-smart fable of friendship and misogyny</p><p>And what if it’s not – just this once – about the boy?” This question comes early in Victoria Gosling’s second novel Bliss &amp; Blunder, a modern reworking of Arthurian legend that upends Britain’s most enduring myth of noble patriarchy. Arthur is now a tech billionaire. His wife, Gwen, is a reluctant influencer, subject to online adoration and abuse. The knights of the Round Table are tech bros. Lancelot is an Afghanistan vet suffering from PTSD, best friend to Arthur and lover to Gwen. Gwen married Arthur young and now lives adrift and lonely after multiple miscarriages, neglected by her distant husband and haunted by cyber-stalker The Invisible Knight. As the novel opens, Morgan, Gwen’s former best friend, is coming home after two decades away, grief-stricken and bent on revenge.</p><p>In their small Wiltshire town, these fortysomethings have been drinking at the Green Knight since they were teenagers. The “knights” jockey for Arthur’s favour, desperate to maintain status and the status quo. Women have a choice: compliance, which either looks like flirting or mothering; or, as in Morgan’s case, exile. Her return threatens to uncover bullying, harassment and even murder buried in toxic banter. The question “You losing your sense of humour in your old age?” is enough to wither any dissent. Gosling’s prose is ironic, honest and humorous in a postmodern collage of myth and modernity, discourses colliding so that Arthur and Gwen’s adopted son Mo can comment: “Time cannot be redeemed … It is not Tesco Clubcard points.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/18/bliss-blunder-by-victoria-gosling-review-an-arthurian-legend-for-our-times">Continue reading...</a>

Among these will be a march in Sheffield, archival displays in Edinburgh, a concert in Swansea, and a conference and picket of the Chilean embassy in London.</p><p>Few past events in faraway countries receive this level of attention. Military takeovers were not unusual in South America during the cold war. And Chile has been a relatively stable democracy since the Pinochet dictatorship ended, 33 years ago.

<p>Defence committee report says British military needs urgently to adapt over coming decades to be effective</p><p>The Ministry of Defence (MoD) must urgently tackle the impact of the climate crisis on its operations to make sure the capability of the UK armed forces is not eroded by rising temperatures and harsh climatic conditions, MPs have said.</p><p>The impact of global heating on the armed forces covers every aspect of their operations. These include high temperatures making training locations such as Cyprus unusable at certain times of the year, increasingly harsh conditions for armed service personnel operating abroad, the threat that armoured vehicles will break down in rising temperatures and the risk to the UK from a collapse in security across the world.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/18/mod-must-act-to-tackle-impact-of-climate-crisis-on-uk-forces-mps-say">Continue reading...</a>

## Harlan Coben’s Shelter review – this twisty thriller is as charming as The Goonies

<p>There’s a sweetness to this book adaptation – about a high school outsider searching for a missing friend – which recalls 80s teen classics. It’s also a murder-mystery rollercoaster ride</p><p>It feels odd to call an adaptation of a Harlan Coben thriller “charming”, but the eight-part Shelter series is just that. Netflix acquired crime writer Coben’s big standalone novels in a five-year, multimillion-pound deal for the rights to 14 of his 34 books, and its renewal in 2022 is thought to have included the best-selling Myron Bolitar series, too. But Prime Video has nabbed his young adult series, whose protagonist is Myron’s nephew, Mickey; this is a dramatisation of the first Mickey book.</p><p>It has slightly less gore than usual and an even more madly corkscrewing plot. But the charm – reminiscent of early teen fare, such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/18/the-goonies-review-indomitable-all-american-innocence">The Goonies</a>, that the 80s offered while it waited for you to graduate to John Hughes – is still an unexpected bonus.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/aug/18/harlan-cobens-shelter-review-this-twisty-thriller-is-as-charming-as-the-goonies">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Ben has a great pelvis and it’s wonderful to show it’: Ira Sachs, Franz Rogowski and Ben Whishaw on their erotic new film

<p>Rogowski and Whishaw star in Passages, Sachs’ film about a gay couple whose marriage is upturned when one has an affair with a woman. They talk power struggles, micro-gestures and a sex scene that proved too much for US censors</p><p>‘These interviews are full of shit,” says Franz Rogowksi, eyeballing the webcam in his Berlin apartment, a slash of Sunday morning sunshine streaking the wall behind him. This would be an awkward moment were the vulpine 37-year-old actor not wearing a lopsided smile, his voice free of rancour or complaint. What he is trying to get across is that there are certain conventions when promoting a movie. “People say: ‘Oh, this is so amazing, the project was so amazing.’ You and I would be having this exact same conversation even if this movie was shit. But I truly love what we’ve done.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/24/passages-movie-review-ira-sachs-sundance" title="">The movie in question is Passages</a>, a caustic, concentrated, jaggedly funny and aggressively erotic portrait of a relationship in freefall. Rogowski plays Tomas, a film-maker living in chic luxury in Paris with his husband, Martin (Ben Whishaw). After wrapping his new film, also called Passages, Tomas goes home with a schoolteacher called Agathe (Adèle Exarchopoulos), whom he meets in a club. Martin is bruised by this dalliance, not least when Tomas starts crowing about how blissful it was, but he takes it wearily in his stride. “You’re always like this when you finish a film,” he says. “You just forget.” This, however, is no fling.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/18/ben-whishaw-great-pelvis-ira-sachs-franz-rogowski-passages">Continue reading...</a>
