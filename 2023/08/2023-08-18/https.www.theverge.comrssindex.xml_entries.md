  <p id="vid6Vv">Two of the biggest names in the NFT space are clashing over the future of how the tokens’ creators get paid. Yuga Labs, the company behind Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks, <a href="https://twitter.com/yugalabs/status/1692627502999691453">said today</a> that it would block the ability to trade its newer NFTs on OpenSea by February 2024. The move is meant to protest OpenSea’s decision to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/17/23836440/nft-creator-royalty-fees-are-dead-opensea-optional">stop collecting royalties</a> on behalf of NFT creators — a huge blow to Yuga’s business.</p>
<p id="jlswu4">One of the big promises of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq">NFTs</a> was that their original creator would get a cut every time they were resold. For companies like Yuga, which saw explosive prices on its Bored Ape collection for a time, those royalty fees added up to tens of millions of dollars (a <a href="https://gordongoner.substack.com/p/on-marketplaces-and-creator-royalties">blog post</a> suggests the number was $35 million for Bored Apes alone just...</p>

  <p id="OO1IsU">A Cruise robotaxi in San Francisco collided with a San Francisco Fire Department truck late Thursday, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/18/cruise-self-driving-car-in-san-francisco-fire-truck-crash-one-injured.html">CNBC reports</a>. A passenger riding inside the Cruise self-driving vehicle suffered “non-severe injuries” and was transported in an ambulance, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/Cruise/status/1692491371792204092">an official company post on X</a> (formally Twitter) this morning.</p>
<p id="yjga5e">The company says its car, which was driverless at the time, “entered the intersection on a green light” before getting “struck by an emergency vehicle.” The post noted that the fire department vehicle was on its way to an emergency scene, suggesting the possibility that the Cruise vehicle did not yield to an emergency vehicle. The crash occurred around 10PM local time in the Tenderloin district of the city.</p>

<p id="qoBx3d"><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/mad-men-machines-big-advertisers-shift-ai-2023-08-18/"><em>Reuters</em> reported</a> large advertising agencies like WPP and multinational corporations like Unilever look to generative AI to cut marketing costs while making more ads. </p>
<p id="UQQMXs">WPP clients Nestlé and Mondelez, makers of Oreo and Cadbury, used OpenAI’s DALL-E 2 to make ads. One ad for Cadbury ran in India with an AI-generated video of the Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan inviting pedestrians to shop at stores. WPP’s CEO told <em>Reuters</em> savings from generative AI can be “10 to 20 times.”</p>

Their advanced technology allows them to live in floating cities with the human elite, while the rest of the population scrapes by on the surface. Because of this, some new ways of making money arise — including a very intimate form of livestreaming. Because the Vuuv do not have romance like humans, they’re obsessed with watching young couples broadcast their lives, tipping generously along the way.</p>
<p id="firstHeading">For Tiffany Haddish, who stars in the film, part of the appeal was that the premise didn’t seem that far-fetched. “I really love [director and writer Cory Finley] a lot, I love his work,”...</p>
