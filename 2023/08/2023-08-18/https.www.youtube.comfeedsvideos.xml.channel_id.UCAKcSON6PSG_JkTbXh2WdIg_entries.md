Twenty years into a hip-hop career that includes 10 years as part of the acclaimed group Run The Jewels, Killer Mike has released the solo album, "Michael," (available on @LomaVistaRecs) so that people would get to know the more personal side of Michael Render, “that little nine-year-old boy on the album cover with the horns and the halo and the buck teeth and the smile.”

Watch Killer Mike and the Midnight Revival Choir perform three songs from "Michael."

Following the session, Killer Mike sat down with host Jill Riley to share his story. Watch that interview here: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2023/08/16/killer-mike-shares-his-music-and-his-story-michael-album
