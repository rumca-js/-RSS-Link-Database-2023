(His work has involved investigating the use of VR therapy for overcoming fear of heights and of needles, for instance.)</p><p>Freeman founded OxfordVR, a spinout firm (recently merged with US-based BehaVR), which is responsible for gameChange, a VR-based treatment for severe psychosis-related agoraphobia that\u2019s currently in trials with health services in the UK and US. The gameChange treatment involves the use of VR by house-bound patients to simulate everyday situations such as a caf\u00e9, pub, or bus trip. It was used in a trial involving hundreds of patients \u2014 thought to be the largest randomized, controlled trial involving VR mental health treatment so far \u2014 with the results published in <em>The Lancet</em>\u00a0indicating that the automated VR therapy led to significant reductions in distress related to everyday situations. <em>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</em></p><p class=\"jumpTag\"><a href=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/3704616/how-vr-can-automate-delivery-of-mental-health-treatment.html#jump\">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>", "link": "https://www.computerworld.com/article/3704616/how-vr-can-automate-delivery-of-mental-health-treatment.html#tk.rss_all", "date_published": "2023-08-18T10:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2023/08/48403746206_a01b8f239d_o-100944818-small.jpg"}]
