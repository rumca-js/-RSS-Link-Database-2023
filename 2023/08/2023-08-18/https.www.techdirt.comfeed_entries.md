And, indeed, for years we’ve pointed out that social engineering is generally more effective than [&#8230;]

Jordan will never be mistaken for a human rights haven. The State Department&#8217;s assessment of the kingdom of Jordan&#8217;s human rights environment is, at best, extremely dismal. Significant human rights issues included credible reports of: torture and other cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment by government authorities; arbitrary arrest and detention; political prisoners or [&#8230;]

Let’s start from the basics here: if you tax something, you will get less of it. That’s how taxes work. If you want less of something, you add a tax to it. In Canada, some very, very clueless politicians (pushed by the news media) passed a tax on Facebook and Google linking to news. Both [&#8230;]
