<p>Twitch announced this week that an upcoming change will allow streamers to block banned users from tuning into their streams. “You can choose to have your banned chatters no longer be able to watch the stream,” Senior Product Manager Trevor Fisher revealed on Twitch’s <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1900471801?t=0h14m41s"><em>Patch Notes </em>podcast</a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/17/twitch-will-let-streamers-block-banned-users-from-watching-streams/">via</a><em>TechCrunch</em>), stressing that the feature won’t be enabled by default. The new blocking feature will roll out in the next few weeks.</p><p>“The way that it will work is if you ban somebody and they’re currently watching, then the stream playback will be interrupted for them so that they immediately lose the ability to view the stream,” he explained. “And then if you go offline, you stream again, they won’t be able to watch your subsequent streams either until you choose to un-ban them.” He said it would have the same effect regardless of whether the streamer or a moderator bans someone: That person can’t watch your streams until they’re unblocked.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>One significant limitation to the new feature is that it only applies to logged-in users: Anyone viewing a stream while logged out of their account can still watch it. Twitch isn’t blocking IP addresses (at least for now), which leaves room for the noteworthy exception.</p><p>Fisher stressed that this is an incremental change that only partially addresses some of the platform’s moderation problems, including multiple women <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-sexual-abuse-allegations-165741108.html">accusing Twitch streamers</a> of sexual abuse and misconduct. Other moves to address the issue have included adding a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-shield-mode-anti-harassment-180003661.html">one-button anti-harassment tool</a>, enhancing its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-2022-safety-plans-232940991.html">reporting and appeals process</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-community-guidelines-rewrite-170050737.html">rewriting its community policies</a> and taking a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-takes-a-harder-stance-against-explicit-deepfakes-175407437.html">stronger stance against deepfakes</a>. “We know that this is an area where people want us to do more, and it’s just been shipping off one part of the problem at a time,” Fisher said.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/twitch-streamers-can-soon-block-banned-accounts-from-tuning-in-195923803.html?src=rss

## Sega completes purchase of Rovio for $776 million

<p>Sega Sammy has <a href="https://twitter.com/SEGA/status/1692446143370657870"><ins>completed its purchase</ins></a> of <em>Angry Birds</em> developer Rovio, officially plunking down a cool $776 million to acquire the company. The deal was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sega-is-buying-angry-birds-maker-rovio-for-776-million-095400749.html"><ins>first floated back in April,</ins></a> but both companies had to jump through some <a href="https://www.rovio.com/articles/final-results-requirements-met-for-sega-europe-to-acquire-rovio-entertainment-corporation/"><ins>finalization and regulatory hoops.</ins></a> Sega’s hoping the purchase will give them a stronger foothold in the mobile space, despite the golden days of <em>Angry Birds</em> fandom <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-11-angry-birds-10-years-old-anniversary-birthday.html"><ins>passing almost 15 years ago.</ins></a></p><p>However, Rovio is not just the one IP. Beyond <em>Angry Birds</em> and its many spinoff games, the company is known for the match-three puzzler <em>Sugar Blast</em> and the narrative mystery title <em>Small Town Murders</em>. Okay, those aren’t exactly high-profile IPs, but Sega gets something beyond recognizable franchise titles with this purchase. It gets a ready-made infrastructure for developing, publishing and advertising mobile games. This means it can hit the ground running when making mobile titles based on its own IPs, like <em>Sonic, Samba de Amigo, Persona, Football Manager</em> and others. There’s also hundreds of older games just waiting for mobile ports.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Back in April, CEO Haruki Satomi said that “the mobile gaming market has especially high potential, and it has been Sega's long-term goal to accelerate its expansion in this field.”</p><p>Beyond Sega’s pre-existing franchises, the company will likely continue with more <em>Angry Birds</em> mobile games. Despite losing some of that late 2000s luster, <em>Angry Birds</em> is still a fairly hot commodity, with related movies, TV shows and even a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-york-is-getting-the-first-ever-angry-birds-cafe-130421618.html"><ins>bizarre restaurant in New York City.</ins></a> Maybe pairing up those annoyed avians with a certain blue hedgehog will bring the one-time mobile smash back into the collective consciousness. Now, who’s up for flinging Knuckles into a bunch of pigs?</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/sega-completes-purchase-of-rovio-for-776-million-191525883.html?src=rss

<p>Microsoft reportedly published — and retracted — an AI-generated article that recommended people visit a Canadian food bank as a tourist attraction. The article “Headed to Ottawa? Here’s what you shouldn’t miss!” included recommendations for catching a baseball game, honoring fallen soldiers at a war museum and… swinging by the Ottawa Food Bank. Paris Marx first <a href="https://twitter.com/parismarx/status/1692233111260582161">called out</a> the story on X (formerly Twitter). “People who come to us have jobs and families to support, as well as expenses to pay,” the AI-written section about the food bank section read. “Life is already difficult enough.

## Lamborghini’s new all-electric concept car was inspired by spaceships

<p>Lamborghini, known for enabling many a mid-life crisis, revealed a new EV concept vehicle at Monterey Car Week, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lamborghini-teases-a-fully-electric-supercar-ahead-of-its-august-18th-reveal-201059772.html"><ins>after teasing the announcement a few day ago.</ins></a> The all-electric Lamborghini Lanzador boasts all kinds of high-tech bells and whistles, with a design actually inspired by spaceships. This grand tourer (GT) vehicle features plenty of infotainment features, with a large Y-shaped center console bridge and a slim dashboard for making adjustments.</p><p>The driver also has instant access to climate controls and various digital functions via an integrated “pilot’s unit.” This unit also allows access to an array of driving modes via the company’s ANIMA control system. There’s even retractable displays that stream pertinent information to passengers regarding speed, distance, climate, entertainment and more.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As for the design, the driver and passenger sit low to the ground, as if in a jet, and are separated by that center console. The company says the interior is “unexpectedly roomy”, despite a roof height of around 1.5 meters, further increasing the car’s low-to-the-ground proportions. The rear space can be used to store luggage and other necessities, and there’s a concealed trunk under the front bonnet for more storage options.</p><p>Design is cool and all, but what about all of those internal speed-enhancing goodies? The Lanzador includes high-powered electric motors on each axle, with a peak power of over one megawatt. There’s all-wheel drive with e-torque on the rear axle for improved cornering. Lamborghini says it's all powered by a “new generation high-performance battery” and ensures a long driving range, but didn’t announce the actual mileage per charge. The company also says that the car’s aerodynamic design should further increase real-world mileage.</p><p>Though strictly a concept car, Lamborghini says the Lanzador is not merely a “whim of designers and engineers” and provides a “concrete preview” of production vehicles that will begin rolling out in 2028. To that end, there’s an emphasis here on eco-friendly design materials, like Merino wool, sustainably tanned leather and recycled carbon. This also adds further proof that the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lamborghini-will-go-fully-electric-in-the-second-part-of-the-decade-114537409.html"><ins>company is serious about going all-electric</ins></a> by 2030.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/lamborghinis-new-all-electric-concept-car-was-inspired-by-spaceships-174550629.html?src=rss

## Fans are adapting 'Twin Peaks' into a PS1-style adventure game, and there's a demo

<p>You may have watched the original run of <em>Twin Peaks</em> so many times that you exclaim “damn fine coffee” each and every time you grab a cup, but have you ever played the story through the eyes of FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper? You’ll soon be able to do just that via the magic of video games. A small French developer called Blue Rose Team has been prepping <em>Twin Peaks: Into the Night</em> for a while now, and it <a href="https://blueroseteam.itch.io/twin-peaks-into-the-night"><ins>just dropped a demo</ins></a> of the fan-made game.</p><p>The graphics are retro and decidedly PS1-flavored, which makes sense given how the show premiered in 1990. The gameplay looks to be full of exploration, complete with conversations with the town’s many oddball residents, though there’s a survival horror element reminiscent of the original <em>Resident Evil</em> titles. This is also an appropriate design choice, as the show pits Agent Cooper against foes both physical and supernatural. You should expect appearances from the infamous one-armed man, the chaos agent Bob, nefarious former FBI agent Windom Earle and, of course, plenty of owls.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="af8d603268a7491d8958be5d599df51a"></div><p>Beyond gameplay, there looks to be an array of video cutscenes culled from the show itself. The demo, released Tuesday, chronicles events from season one, in which Cooper arrives in Twin Peaks and begins unraveling the murder case of local teen Laura Palmer. The demo is filled with the kind of idiosyncratic quirks and metaphysical horror elements that made the OG show such a hit back in the day.</p><p>The creators have announced that the game will be free when it launches, so that should clear up any potential legal hurdles moving forward. David Lynch is busy doing his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l21GFyOO8Ug"><ins>daily weather reports on YouTube</ins></a> or whatever, so he won’t complain, but ABC and Warner Bros. aren’t quite as chill as the filmmaker/painter/meditation enthusiast.</p><p>There’s no official release date, but the demo should keep you busy for a while. Oddly, this will be the very first <em>Twin Peaks</em> video game adaptation, though <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-09-twin-peaks-vr-trailer.html"><ins>there’s a short VR experience. </ins></a>Despite never being officially adapted, the show has inspired plenty of games, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/alan-wake-ii-stands-out-in-a-sea-of-sequels-140010178.html"><ins>from the </ins><em><ins>Alan Wake</ins></em><ins> series</ins></a> to a little-known title called <a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2023/05/twin-peaks-co-creator-says-he-gave-some-ideas-for-links-awakening/"><em><ins>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</ins></em><ins>.</ins></a> It also goes without saying that <em>Twin Peaks: Into the Night</em> doesn’t delve into the events of Showtime’s <em>Twin Peaks: The Return, </em>so don’t expect to control Jim Belushi.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/fans-are-adapting-twin-peaks-into-a-ps1-style-adventure-game-and-theres-a-demo-163643462.html?src=rss

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google-keep/"><ins>Google Keep</ins></a>, the company's note-taking app, is getting a long-overdue feature that unfortunately doesn't seem fully baked. Google is adding a version history function, which could save you from having to manually retype a lot of text that you mistakenly deleted.</p><p>The tool allows you to download a text file with previous versions of your notes and lists, according to <a href="https://support.google.com/keep/answer/13820887?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;oco=0"><ins>a support page</ins></a>. The help document states that Google is gradually rolling out the feature to everyone, so it may not be live for you yet. When it is, you can access it on the Keep web app, by clicking on the three-dot menu at the bottom of a note.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="bf7a4db3adb746b886fbfd042443dff9"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Google Keep's Version History.

What's more, it doesn't cover images, so if you deleted a photo from a note, you won't be able to recover it using this option.</p><p>This is a fairly basic feature and it's somewhat baffling that Google hasn't offered it in Keep until now. After all, the company has long offered similar functions in Google Drive apps. The implementation is odd too. Rather than seeing the version history in the app and being able to revert to a previous incarnation of a note with a tap (like you can do in apps like Docs), having to download a file and copy text back in manually seems like a strange choice. That said, this is a step in the right direction for Keep.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-keep-is-finally-adding-version-history-154441384.html?src=rss

You should see the full discount at checkout. Apple sells the 10.2-inch tablet for $329, though we've regularly seen it retail closer to $275.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The entry-level slate is certainly getting long in the tooth, as its non-laminated display, thick bezels and Lightning port give it an altogether more dated design than newer iPads. Its 64GB of storage is low, too. At this price, though, the 9th-gen iPad remains <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-ipads-how-to-pick-the-best-apple-tablet-for-you-150054066.html">one of the better values</a> in the tablet market, with a sturdy aluminum frame, 10 or so hours of battery life and fast-enough performance for casual media consumption. There's always a chance Apple will introduce new iPads later this year, but if you just want the cheapest route into iPadOS, this model should be enough.</p><h2>Astro A40 TR</h2><p></p><p>The <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BU1RSTy1HYW1pbmctV2lyZWQtSGVhZHNldC1BdWRpby1YYm94L2RwL0IwN05TUllESDk_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMXUzLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjOTYyZjgzZi1hZWExLTQ2NGUtOTBiYy05YzhjNzNjYzJkNTkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfxGEzFWbWibajPvDKVCQ6DVu5zrH48xHzVMNb_gce05&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FASTRO-Gaming-Wired-Headset-Audio-Xbox%2Fdp%2FB07NSRYDH9">Astro A40 TR</a> is on sale for $100, which is $30 off its usual street price and ties the lowest price we've seen. The A40 TR is the top pick in our guide to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-headset-130006477.html">the best gaming headsets</a>, as its open-back design gives it a more spacious and enveloping sound that most competitors. It emphasizes the bass, but not to an overwhelming degree, and it's comfortable to wear to extended periods. That said, the built-in mic is just OK, and like any open-back headphone, the whole thing both leaks and lets in lots of outside noise, so it's not ideal if you usually play in a noisy room. In general, you can get better value from a pair of "normal" wired headphones than a dedicated gaming headset unless you need a mic. If you really want an all-in-one solution, though, the A40 TR is a worthwhile compromise.&nbsp;</p><h2>Samsung Pro Plus</h2><p></p><p>The <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMEMxUFQ5WFhTP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTF1My0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYzk2MmY4M2YtYWVhMS00NjRlLTkwYmMtOWM4YzczY2MyZDU5In0&amp;signature=AQAAAVebJ72EN7VieRArOXmqgUaU6MimJJo6mK6EPlgR-52J&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0C1PT9XXS">Samsung Pro Plus</a> is the top pick in our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-microsd-card-130038282.html">microSD card buying guide</a>, and right now its 128GB, 256GB and 512GB models are down to <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMEMxUFQ5WFhTP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTF1My0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYzk2MmY4M2YtYWVhMS00NjRlLTkwYmMtOWM4YzczY2MyZDU5In0&amp;signature=AQAAAVebJ72EN7VieRArOXmqgUaU6MimJJo6mK6EPlgR-52J&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0C1PT9XXS">$12</a>, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMEMxUFBXVFdUP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTF1My0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYzk2MmY4M2YtYWVhMS00NjRlLTkwYmMtOWM4YzczY2MyZDU5In0&amp;signature=AQAAAdZlrnYBdlavKi47dt0pKDipS4xlXKZXs91vlpwQj7QS&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0C1PPWTWT">$20</a> and <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMEMxUFJZUFlYP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTF1My0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYzk2MmY4M2YtYWVhMS00NjRlLTkwYmMtOWM4YzczY2MyZDU5In0&amp;signature=AQAAARIZNvdX2JENh6gU2MU9hIjjCU5FWrwuH-2yKAz-59bg&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0C1PRYPYX">$35</a>, respectively.

Apple sells the wireless earbuds for $169, though we often see them go for $10 or $20 less elsewhere. This open-back pair has a more balanced sound than most unsealed earbuds, with more bass depth than usual (albeit not a ton). There’s no ANC, as expected, but you still get wireless charging, relatively intuitive touch controls and the usual Apple-friendly features like fast pairing and Find My tracking. Just note that the earpieces are a little large, so they may not fit well with certain ear shapes. This set is also pricey, and like any other open-back pair, it doesn't isolate much outside noise. Still, if you own an iPhone and hate the feeling of traditional in-ear headphones, it might work.

The big upgrades are a larger 3.4-inch cover display that's more useful for quickly checking notifications or using apps and a redesigned hinge that lets the device fold flat. You still give up some battery life and camera performance compared to more traditional flagship phones around this price, and like any foldable device, you have to take extra care when handling it.

## The Morning After: Fisker reveals more about its Alaska electric pickup

<p>Fisker has shed some more light on its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fiskers-alaska-ev-pickup-has-absurd-big-gulp-and-cowboy-hat-holders-122524635.html"><ins>Alaska electric pickup</ins></a>, which it says will have a base price of just $45,400. The Alaska is a work-friendly vehicle, letting you run your business from the cockpit. It has dedicated work glove and cowboy hat storage, a slide-out laptop tray and a cup holder big enough to hold a day’s worth of water.</p><p>The default flatbed is 4.5 feet, but you can drop the partition to increase that to 7.5 feet. Lower the seats and the liftgate and you can push it to 9.2 feet, big enough to haul several sheets of plywood from one job to the next. But much as Fisker may promise this will be one of the lightest and cheapest EVs in its class, we’ll wait to see how much it <em>actually</em> costs when it debuts in 2025 before making a judgment.</p><p>– Dan Cooper</p><p><em>You can get these reports delivered daily, direct to your inbox. </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em><ins>Subscribe right here!</ins></em></a>​​​​</p><h3>The biggest stories you might have missed</h3><h3></h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html"><ins>The best wireless earbuds for 2023</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-laptop-150038435.html"><ins>The best budget laptops for 2023</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-sale-slashes-fire-tv-streaming-devices-by-up-to-51-percent-094341678.html"><ins>Amazon sale slashes Fire TV streaming devices by up to 51 percent </ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-revamped-freestyle-projector-is-now-available-to-pre-order-130013689.html"><ins>Samsung's revamped Freestyle projector is now available to pre-order</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-will-include-the-series-biggest-zombies-map-ever-180029216.html"><ins>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III will include the series' biggest zombies map ever</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/homeworld-deserts-of-kharak-will-be-free-on-the-epic-games-store-this-month-181511485.html"><ins>Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak will be free on Epic Games Store this month </ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/alan-wake-ii-delayed-by-10-days-will-arrive-on-october-27th-150033546.html"><ins>Alan Wake II, delayed by 10 days, will arrive on October 27</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-take-a-screenshot-on-windows-120001872.html"><ins>How to take a screenshot on a Windows PC</ins></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/can-modeling-microphones-deliver-on-their-copycat-promise-133036629.html"><ins>Can modeling microphones deliver on their copycat promise?</ins></a></h2><h3>It’s a Swiss Army-microphone for audio pros on a budget.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/can-modeling-microphones-deliver-on-their-copycat-promise-133036629.html"><figure><img alt="Image of the Sphere LX Microphone in front of a blurred background of an audio screen." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/5f2905d0-3dab-11ee-8ffd-1c0339571987" style="height: 423px; width: 625px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by James Trew / Engadget</div></figure></a><p>Professional microphones are as unique as the instruments they’re built to record, each with their own voices.

## Rally's and Checkers are using AI chatbots for Spanish-language food orders

<p>Checkers and Rally's restaurants have launched the first Spanish ordering system that uses AI, Checkers restaurants <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230817685661/en/Checkers-and-Rally%E2%80%99s-Roll-Out-Hi-Auto%E2%80%99s-First-Ever-Spanish-Language-Drive-Thru-Voice-AI-Ordering">announced</a>. The system from a company called <a href="https://hi.auto/">Hi Auto</a> is already in use at 350 of those restaurants, following two months of beta testing at five locations. The service allows for a more "inclusive environment" by accommodating Spanish speakers, the company said, but it remains to be seen whether customers or employees will embrace it.</p><p>The system takes orders via a virtual assistant and detects the customer's language spoken, automatically switching between English and Spanish. Hi Auto says it has "unique customization capabilities" that let franchises easily scale the system up. The company promises to streamline ordering with a greater than 95 percent order accuracy rate.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>"Our expanded partnership with Checkers and Rally’s represents a huge breakthrough for the country’s Spanish-speaking and bilingual communities, and allows every restaurant to cater to the Spanish speaking population at any time," said Hi Auto CEO Roy Baharav.</p><p>AI drive-through order-taking is a unique challenge, however, thanks to an environment that tends to be noisy and chaotic. "You may think driving by and speaking into a drive-thru is an easy problem for AI, but it’s actually one of the hardest," Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian recently <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2f007401-3eaa-4237-b69b-54ccbe125502&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Wall+Street+Journal&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyZjAwNzQwMS0zZWFhLTQyMzctYjY5Yi01NGNjYmUxMjU1MDIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy93ZW5keXMtZ29vZ2xlLXRyYWluLW5leHQtZ2VuZXJhdGlvbi1vcmRlci10YWtlci1hbi1haS1jaGF0Ym90LTk2OGZmODY1IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmNmI3OTBhNC0xNjU2LTQyODctYmI5MS1iYjQ0ZTYxYmVhMGQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUxRelYFxvYnlL1F5j8CzPmzA1UEgJtYORPL7VOBp5qK&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Fwendys-google-train-next-generation-order-taker-an-ai-chatbot-968ff865">told <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> in reference to the company's recent collaboration with Wendy's.

The <em>WSJ</em> reported that three people out of 10 using AI systems asked to speak with a human employee due to errors or the desire to speak to a person.</p><p>Hi Auto is up against some giants, as well. One of the first companies to look at the tech was McDonald's, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mcdonalds-ibm-ai-food-orders-131806578.html">teamed up with IBM</a> to accelerate its own AI ordering systems, and starting testing them in 10 Chicago-area restaurants last year. It's also competing with Google Cloud, which is testing its systems at White Castle on top of Wendy's.</p><p>The system does offer features restaurant chains want, though. It can "upsell relentlessly" on items like deserts and french fries, resulting in higher orders, according to <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/06/17/business/ai-drive-thru/index.html"><em>CNN</em></a>. It may also allow restaurants to cut employees, boosting their bottom lines but reducing the number of jobs available to young people. That said, the restaurant with the highest customer service marks last year was Chick-fil-A, thanks in part to its face-to-face human ordering system, according to a recent survey from <a href="https://www.intouchinsight.com/blog/2022-drive-thru-study">Intouch Insight</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/rallys-and-checkers-are-using-ai-chatbots-for-spanish-language-food-orders-090931426.html?src=rss

## Spotify almost removed 'white noise' podcasts to save money

<p>White noise podcast creators on Spotify are making serious money, and the audio streaming service was reportedly not happy about it and tried to cut them off. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-08-17/white-noise-podcasters-are-costing-spotify-38-million-a-year?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, it has viewed an internal document revealing that podcasts with white noise content, such as the sounds of waves, vacuums and whirring fans, accounted for a total of 3 million consumption hours on the platform every single day. That was made possible by Spotify's algorithm inadvertently pushing these types of content to its listeners as part of its efforts to become the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-06-spotify-gimlet-anchor-podcast-profitable.html">go-to app for podcasts</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Previously, <em>Bloomberg</em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-01/how-to-make-money-on-spotify-a-white-noise-podcast-could-bring-you-big-bucks?sref=10lNAhZ9">reported</a> that white noise podcasters were making as $18,000 a month. A lot of creators on the platform, not just those broadcasting white noise, use Spotify's free hosting software <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-anchor-podcast-playlist-format-133051601.html">Anchor</a> to publish their shows. Spotify purchased Anchor back in 2019, and in addition to helping creators make and distribute their podcasts, it can also monetize their content.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While white noise podcasts turned out to be a hit with listeners, they apparently don't make Spotify as much money as other types of programming. The company reportedly considered removing them altogether and preventing future uploads in the category. Plus, it thought of altering its algorithm to recommend &quot;comparable programming&quot; that's more economical for Spotify. Doing all those would raise the company's annual gross profit by $38 million. The news organization didn't say if Spotify elaborated on what it meant by &quot;comparable programming&quot; in the internal document, but they could be other types of content meant to induce and improve sleep, as well as to help calm anxiety, which is what white noise is typically used for.&nbsp;</p><p>A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/14ew6tp/white_noise_podcasts_vanished/">thread on the Spotify subreddit</a> posted a couple of months ago show multiple users complaining that the white noise podcasts they listen to had disappeared. <em>Bloomberg</em> also talked to a creator who said their content had vanished for a few weeks before being reinstated. Spotify didn't confirm whether it temporarily pulled white noise podcasts from its service, but it told the news organization that ultimately, &quot;[t]he proposal in question did not come to fruition&quot; and that it continues &quot;to have white noise podcasts on [its] platform.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/spotify-almost-removed-white-noise-podcasts-to-save-money-065639545.html?src=rss

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-sale-slashes-fire-tv-streaming-devices-by-up-to-51-percent-094341678.html">Amazon</a> has started testing a new star rating system in specific regions that makes it harder to gauge how buyers are liking a specific product. <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/amazon-tests-new-star-ratings/"><em>Android Police</em></a> has spotted the the experimental system on the company's mobile app in India, its German website and its global website when accessed from Germany. We couldn't replicate what the publication has seen on the US website, but it looks like the test replaces the website's weighted average rating that's typically shown through an image with five stars. Instead of that illustration, buyers see a single yellow star next to the product image with the percentage of 5-star ratings it had received.&nbsp;</p><p>People wouldn't be able to tell at a glance whether a product's average rating is 5 or 3.5, because it's represented by a single yellow star in both cases. It's also not immediately visible how many reviews a product has received so far, seeing as the new system only shows the percentage of 5-star ratings. As the publication notes, this makes it easier for sellers to dupe potential buyers by unscrupulously looking for ways to get 5-star reviews to counteract the negative ones.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That said, Amazon hasn't completely removed ratings breakdown and details. Potential buyers who look at the number of reviews a product has gotten and not just its average score can click through to see its ratings breakdown on the product page. It's not ideal and could make picking a product to buy longer than it should take, but at least the option exists. When asked, an Amazon spokesperson didn't confirm the experimental feature and simply told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/17/23836062/amazon-new-five-star-ratings-system-hard-to-read"><em>The Verge</em></a>: &quot;We are always innovating on behalf of customers to provide the best possible shopping experience.&quot; Testing a feature doesn't always lead to a wide release, though, and Amazon might make changes to this rating system if it does decide to implement it.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/amazon-is-reportedly-testing-a-confusing-star-rating-system-045945281.html?src=rss
