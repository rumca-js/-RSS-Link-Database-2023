Customers decided if they were going to drink cheap beer from a global corporation that hates them, they were at least not going to drink one from a company that said so out loud. And the first to speak out was Kid Rock.</p><p>Kid Rock <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kid-rock-bud-light" target="_blank">shot up a few twelve-packs</a> in a popular viral video. Five months later, the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/budweiser-sturgis-motorcycle-rally" target="_blank">entire Anheiser-Buch brand</a> is permanently damaged.</p><p>So dude, what the f*ck?</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</p><p>We here at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website aren't mad as much as we are disappointed. If you needed a beer that badly and saw no lines at the Bud kiosk, it would be understandable to buy one and deal with your boys razzing you for drinking TRANSmission fluid. Never let he be said we aren't reasonable people.</p><p>But you're Kid Motherf*cking Rock. You don't wait in lines. You can get any beer that you want AND have it handed to you by a girl with her t*tties out. Also, and this is key, you're stinkin' rich and can afford good beer that isn't glorified reconstituted bum piss. </p><p>And the virtue signaling while shooting up Bud Light cans? You might as well be Leonard DiCaprio racing his private jet against Al Gore racing his private jet to a conference to lecture the world about climate change.</p><p>Shame, Kid Rock. Shame.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Comedian claims he solved who brought cocaine to the White House: "The guy who had hookers snort it off his..."

<p>Schneider is referring to Joe Biden's 2nd favorite son Hunter Biden. Beau Biden is his get-out-of-responsibly free son because, I'm not sure if you know this, Beau died. Hunter is the son who moved into the White House this summer and had a known drug problem.</p><p>However, it needs to be said that Rob Schneider is claiming WITHOUT EVIDENCE that Hunter Biden had hookers snorting blow off his c*ck. "Independent" "fact" checkers have yet to find proof of hookers snorting blow off of Hunter's c*ck. And even if there was video of Hunter Biden letting hookers snort blow off of his c*ck, it's probably Russian disinformation.</p><p>There are videos of Hunter <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/hunter-biden-sensory-tank" target="_blank">smoking crack that were found on his laptop</a>. At a $75000 DETOX place his dad paid for. Even more embarrassing, he was crushing White Claws too. But crack, while a <em>form</em> of cocaine, is smoked and not snorted. </p><p>There are also plenty of videos of <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/hunter-biden-third-laptop" target="_blank">Hunter banging whores</a> while bragging that his dad was going to be president. No cocaine in sight though.</p><p>Hunter also, allegedly, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/hunter-biden-movies-dad" target="_blank">sent his dad videos of his homemade porn</a>. That has nothing to do with cocaine. I just think it's hilarious.</p><p>Until a reliable and legitimate news outlet reports undeniable evidence that Hunter Biden let hookers snort cocaine off of his c*ck, we're forced to rate Schneider's bit as "Mostly false, but probably true."</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

Why there's so much real estate in the country with high-end that's totally empty? Because people from China, Russia, South America who are doing nefarious stuff, they will buy a flat for $140,000,000. They don't live there. They don't rent. They can't as an asset investment.

<p>Presidential candidate Ron DeSantis tried to block countries like China from buying up property, but Joe Biden's Department of Justice claims that's unconstitutional.

## Joe Rogan goes scorched Earth on silly climate activists: "You're not saving jack sh*t!"

And there are silly activists who have been raised to believe the sky is falling, so they lay down in traffic. Joe Rogan has five simple words for the alarmists: "You’re not saving jack sh*t."</p><p>His guest, former CIA officer Mike Baker, pointed out how the bulk of carbon gets produced by China and India.

<p>I understand. It's because the Left is using the fear of a changing climate as an excuse to regulate Americans within an inch of our lives. And with the presidential race coming up, it's something voters need to take more seriously. We tend to focus more on sexier, more divisive issues. Like how Donald Trump turned over the government to Anthony Fauci and didn't drain the swamp. Or how mean and unfair it is for Ron DeSantis to run against him. </p><p>We need to spend more time listening to all the things Democrats want to ban and believe them.

## Former Disney star blasts "Snow White's" Rachel Zegler as alleged cyberbullying tweets come to light

<img src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=34946393&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0" /><br /><br /><p>We haven't reached the "I'M BEING CYBERBULLIED!!!!111!!11!!" part of the Snow White/Rachel Zegler brouhaha (if I can invoke a little French). If you saw that video of her whining from two years ago, you know it's coming. So let's take a trip back to when the actress was acting unkind to another Disney actress, Gina Carano.</p><p>First, here is Zegler presumably responding to the criticism of how much <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/snow-white-disney-cancels-the-prince" target="_blank">she hates Snow White</a>. Note she is so insufferable she has her pronouns in her name. That's an important point of information.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

        <a href="https://twitter.com/rachelzegler/status/1690089487257178112"></a>
</blockquote>

<p>Former Mandalorian star, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/gina-carano-fired" target="_blank">who got canceled from Disney for sharing a meme</a>, responded with a .gif:</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;"></div> —  (@)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/ginacarano/status/1691948987606286661"></a>
</blockquote>

<p>Carano at one point had her pronouns in her name. Beep/Bop/Boop. Before they got her fired for a meme, Leftists and other insufferable woke twats attempted to get the actress fired for making a mockery of declaring pronouns. Because, and I can't stress this enough, it's ridiculous and deserves to be mocked. <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/calls-to-fire-the-mandalorian-star-gina-carano-trend-on-twitter-again" target="_blank">Carano addressed the controversy at the time</a>: "<em>They're mad cuz I won't put pronouns in my bio to show my support for trans lives. After months of harassing me in every way. I decided to put 3 VERY controversial words in my bio.. beep/bop/boop I'm not against trans lives at all. They need to find less abusive representation."</em></p><p>One of Carano's peers who went on the attack and wouldn't calm down? Rachel Zegler. (shout out <a href="https://twitter.com/Dataracer117/status/1692312998633979993/photo/3" target="_blank">Dataracer on X</a>):</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>Zegler cowardly subtweeting made it clear. The 69th Rachel Regiment knew exactly what to do next:</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>When we get to Zegler crying video about how mean people are being to her, or when they launch to coordinated PR campaign where everyone all at once tweets their support and attacks Zegler haters, remember what goes around comes around.</p><p>It is funny how celebrities only care about the world becoming kinder when it's being mean to them.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
