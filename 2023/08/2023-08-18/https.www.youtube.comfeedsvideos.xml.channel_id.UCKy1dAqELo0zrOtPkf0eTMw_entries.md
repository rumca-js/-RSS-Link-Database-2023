## The “Across The Spider-Verse” Edits Are Not What You Think…And That’s a Good Thing

Spider-Man Across the Spider-Verse pits Miles Morales against a new problem, not to mention Miguel O’Hara and every Spider-Man under his command. Alongside Gwen Stacy in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, many difficult emotional hurdles of being a kid and being a hero get focus. You may think the villain of Spiderman Across the Spiderverse comes from SpiderMan 2099, but some thing it may actually be…the editing room?! There are multiple universes in the Spiderverse featuring versions of Peter Parker and Spiderman.

“Into the SpiderVerse” and “Across the SpiderVerse” have a big difference though: there were multiple edits of the sequel that came out in theaters and on the home release, leaving people confused and annoyed. Is it a meta take from Marvel Comics’ webslinger? Is Peter B Parker somehow responsible? One thing’s for sure about “Across the Spider Verse,” there are/were two distinct versions and now we know why and the ramifications. Have you come across both of the Spider-Verse 2 versions? When did you first notice a slight change? And did you or did you not think it was an example of the Mandela Effect? Check it all out here on IGN with host Kim Horcher.
