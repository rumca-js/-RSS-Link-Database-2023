## ‘I don’t know why our boobs are so frightening’: why musicians in Spain are going topless as a radical gesture

The dignity of our fragility, of our strength. Because there are too many of us.” In a concert marking the Spanish band’s 25-year career, going topless was a way of defending women’s dignity and freedom to go nude, and “a very important moment”, Amaral later told El País.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/18/topless-spanish-singers-radical-gesture-eva-amaral">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘The kids love the freedom here’ – how we made the perfect Swedish summer house

<p>With its recycled furniture and pops of colour, this Scandi beach cabin is a lesson in how to make vintage come alive</p><p>Cathy Nordström’s summer house is a three-minute cycle from the beach in Torekov, a fishing village in Skåne, Sweden’s southernmost county. In August, when the schools are shut, it’s not unusual for Nordström to return from the shops to find eight bikes stacked up against the front of the house and a horde of sandy children inside. “It’s kids, Nerf guns and Lego everywhere, all the time,” she says. “But that’s OK. It’s a summer house: it’s supposed to be lived in.”</p><p>Nordström, a Swedish textile designer, spent her early childhood in Surrey but even then would go to Torekov for the summer. In fact, much of her extended family have <em>sommarstuga</em><em> </em>(a summer cabin or cottge) in the village. “As a child, I had so much fun here,” she says, “but as I grew older, I tried to rebel against the whole idea. It wasn’t until we had our own kids that I saw how much they appreciate their freedom here. They scream with joy whenever we arrive.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/aug/18/here-how-we-made-the-perfect-swedish-summer-house">Continue reading...</a>

## AI can shape society for the better – but humans and machines must work together | D Fox Harrell

<p>Collaboration rather than command-and-control is key to creating culturally and ethically positive systems</p><p>One of the first images of AI I encountered was a <a href="https://lparchive.org/Neuromancer/Update%2011/1-75.png">white, spectral, hostile, disembodied head</a>. It was in the computer game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer_(video_game)">Neuromancer</a>,<em> </em>programmed by Troy Miles and based on William Gibson’s cyberpunk novel. Other people may have first encountered <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jun/24/nasa-spaceships-talk-chatgpt-larissa-suzuki">HAL 9000</a> from Stanley Kubrik’s 2001: A Space Odyssey<em> </em>or Samantha from Spike Jonze’s Her.</p><p>Images from pop culture influence people’s impressions of AI, but culture has an even more profound relationship to it. If there’s one thing to take away from this article, it is the idea that AI systems are not objective machines, but instead based in human culture: our values, norms, preferences, and behaviours in society. These aspects of our culture are reflected in how systems are engineered. So instead of trying to decide whether AI systems are objectively good or bad for society, we need to design them to reflect the ethically positive culture we truly want.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/18/ai-society-humans-machines-culture-ethics">Continue reading...</a>

## Bette Gordon: ‘I realised: Oh my God, it’s a porn theatre! I was delighted’

<p>The New York director’s 1983 film Variety used a real ‘adult’ cinema to turn around the male gaze. On its re-release, she explains her lifelong drive to push boundaries</p><p>Film-maker Bette Gordon is having her photo taken. It might be more accurate to say that she is directing the photo shoot. No smiling, she insists firmly, and instead gives her “don’t-mess-with-me” face. Halfway through the shoot, perched on a red velvet chair, looking stylish in a black leather jacket, she casts an envious eye at the camera. “I hate being photographed,” she tells the photographer: “I’d rather be where you are.”</p><p>Gordon would like to have directed more, in fact. Her <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/08/variety-review-fierce-feminist-porn-drama-from-the-80s-new-york-underground">1983 movie Variety</a>, a radical feminist piece about female desire shot partly in a real-life porn cinema, has recently been rediscovered as a cult classic – it still delivers a jolt of subversive electricity. In the four decades since it was released, Gordon has directed just a handful of features, while working as a professor of film at Columbia University. Over the years, films have got away, “for various reasons”, she sighs. But at the end of the day she is proud of her body of work. “What I can say is that I made the films I wanted to make. I had final cut. Very few directors get that. I had creative control. That was really important to me. I didn’t compromise.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/18/bette-gordon-filmmaker-variety-female-gaze-new-york-porn-theatre">Continue reading...</a>
