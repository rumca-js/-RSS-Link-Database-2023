While the event is sure to be packed to the gills with new gameplay footage and exciting looks at hotly anticipated games, Keighley has explicitly advised viewers to temper their expectations for the showcase, explaining that it will be more focused on highlighting previously announced games rather than revealing world premieres and never-before-seen gameplay. Despite this setting of expectations, however, the hype train is already leaving the station, with rumors running wild of what Geoff and co. have up their sleeves for the event.</p><p>In this episode of Spot On, Lucy and Tam discuss hype, why it matters, and why the topic is a bit more complex than it might seem. For starters, by engaging in pre-game hype, players open themselves up to joy, excitement, and the possibility to bond with like-minded people through powerful communal experiences. Hype is also hugely beneficial to developers, who rely on excited would-be-fans to promote and preorder their games. However, too much of a good thing--particularly when it leads to disappointment or over-promising--can have serious implications. Let's talk about them and a few of the ways we can keep our hype in check.</p><div>          </div><p>Spot On is a weekly news show airing Fridays in which GameSpot's managing editor Tamoor Hussain and senior producer Lucy James talk about the latest news in games.

But the film could have looked quite different. As is often the case with major Hollywood productions, a number of other actors were in the mix for the leading roles. Aragon, Frodo, Gandalf, Arwen, and others could have been played by different people, and it's fascinating to think about what could have been.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In this gallery, we're running through more than a dozen actors who were, or might have been, in the mix for major roles but ultimately didn't make the cut for whatever reason.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Perhaps the best-known and most dramatic example is Stuart Towsend. He was hired to play Aragorn. He trained for the role and was on the ground in New Zealand before everything changed. It was decided that Townsend lacked a certain quality that Jackson was looking for. In the 11th hour, Jackson fired Townsend and hired Viggo Mortensen. As the story goes, Mortensen's son convinced the actor to fly to New Zealand for three years to play the part he is now known best for.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Other actors who could have appeared in The Lord of the Rings included Jake Gyllenhaal, Russell Crowe, Nicolas Cage (yes, really!), Daniel Day-Lewis, Uma Thurman, and even the singer David Bowie. Here's 15 actors who could have starred in The Lord of the Rings.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Stuart Townsend - Aragon</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4180411-screenshot2023-08-18at1.56.11pm.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>Irish actor Stuart Townsend was cast as Aragorn. He says he trained for months and was prepared to go, before he was fired just one day before filming was due to begin. As Townsend tells it, he believes Jackson wanted someone older and didn't realize this until late in the process. Viggo Mortensen, who is 14 years older, got the call--and the rest is history.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Russell Crowe \u2013 Aragorn</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4180412-screenshot2023-08-18at1.57.52pm.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>It's been reported that Russell Crowe was on the shortlist for actors who could replace Townsend as Aragorn. However, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/russell-crowe-talks-about-passing-on-the-lord-of-t/1100-6467944/\">Crowe told Howard Stern</a> that he believes Jackson never really wanted him to play Aragorn. He suggested that studio executives pressured Jackson into talking to him because his star was rising at the time. \"My instinct was that he had somebody else in mind, which turned out to be Viggo Mortensen. And he should be allowed to hire the actor that he wants,\" Crowe said.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Nicolas Cage \u2013 Aragorn</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4180413-screenshot2023-08-18at1.59.08pm.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Actor Nicolas Cage won an Oscar for 1995's Leaving Las Vegas, and he could have broken out into a new level of stardom a few years later by playing Aragorn in The Lord of the Rings. However, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nicolas-cage-reveals-the-very-sweet-reason-he-turned-down-lord-of-the-rings-and-the-matrix/1100-6502637/\">Cage said in 2022</a> that he declined to appear in The Lord of the Rings because he chose to prioritize his family over his career. For The Lord the Rings, he would have needed to live in New Zealand for multiple years as the films were shot back-to-back. Cage also passed on playing Neo in The Matrix (which filmed in Australia) for the same reason.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"There's no version of Nic Cage that didn't put family first over career. I turned down Lord of the Rings and I turned down Matrix because I didn't want to go to New Zealand for three years or Australia for three years because I needed to be home with my son Weston, that's a fact.\"</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Dougray Scott \u2013 Aragorn</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4180414-screenshot2023-08-18at2.01.11pm.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Mission Impossible actor Dougray Scott <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-aragorn-could-have-been-played-b/1100-6476351/\">said in 2020</a> that he was approached to play Aragorn in The Lord of the Rings, but passed on making any effort to audition because it would involve living in New Zealand for a long time. He was never officially offered the role, but says he was sent the script and received an invitation to meet with Jackson. \"The idea of spending that amount of time away in New Zealand at that particular time, I didn't want to do,\" he said.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Daniel Day-Lewis \u2013 Aragorn</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4180416-screenshot2023-08-18at2.02.40pm.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://collider.com/aragorn-actors-lord-of-the-rings/\">According to Collider</a>, Daniel Day-Lewis--an esteemed, award-winning (now-retired) actor known for his method acting--was one of Jackson's top candidates to play Aragorn. Jackson reportedly tried on numerous occasions to get Day-Lewis to play the role, but it didn't work out for reasons that were never made public.

Corden <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-corden-confirms-rumor-he-auditioned-for-lord-of-the-rings/1100-6510266/\">said on the Happy Sad Confused podcast in 2022</a> that he received multiple callbacks, but ultimately, he admits his audition was \"not good.\"</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Sean Connery \u2013 Gandalf</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4180420-screenshot2023-08-18at2.12.49pm.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">The iconic role of the wise wizard Gandalf went to Ian McKellen, but he reportedly wasn't the first choice.

Ordesky said Connery read the script and \"just didn't get it.\"</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Uma Thurman \u2013 Eowyn</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4180421-screenshot2023-08-18at2.14.19pm.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>Uma Thurman, known for her roles in Quentin Tarantino movies like Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai8kW0-oe2Y\">told Stephen Colbert in 2017</a> that the rumors that she turned down a major Lord of the Rings role were true. She told the late-night TV host, \"I do consider it one of the worst decisions ever made.\" Thurman said she had just had her first child, which factored into her decision-making. In the end, Australian actress Miranda Otto landed the part of Eowyn and performed it memorably.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Patrick Stewart \u2013 Gandalf</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4180424-screenshot2023-08-18at2.17.57pm.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>Another actor who was in the running to play Gandalf was Patrick Stewart of Star Trek fame. At a <a href=\"https://trekmovie.com/2008/03/09/new-york-con-reports-pictures-and-video/\">Star Trek fan convention years ago</a>, Stewart said he met with Jackson about playing Gandalf, but Stewart wanted a different part (one that he has never disclosed). Stewart also reportedly didn't love the script. Stewart and Ian McKellen, who ended up landing the role of Gandalf, are very good friends now.

Plummer said he is a big fan of the Lord of the Rings and read the books growing up. Plummer said his performance as Gandalf might have been \"cold\" as opposed to the warmer interpretation we got from McKellen.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Tom Wilkinson - Unspecified Role</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4180431-screenshot2023-08-18at2.25.50pm.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Actor Tom Wilkinson, a famous character actor who has appeared in more than 100 productions in his career, was apparently at least in the running for a part in The Lord of the Rings.

By completing tasks and earning unlock tokens, players could switch from Spider-Man's standard costume to something completely different. Across both games, there were dozens of options to choose from: costumes that were drawn from the rich history of Spider-Man comic books over the decades, outfits from the wallcrawler's numerous cinematic incarnations, and even a handful of original ideas.</p><p>For <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvels-spider-man-2/\">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a>, there's a whole new wardrobe to check out. So far, it looks like developer Insomniac is updating the Spidey Fall Collection with a more original collection of web-slinging threads, with a select number of comic book outfits this time around. We already know that Peter Parker will don his infamous black Symbiote costume for the sequel, with this version of the slimy onesie looking like living armor that's bonded to him.</p><p>Beyond that sinister look, the costumes revealed for Spider-Man so far include new looks inspired by mythology, more tactical options, and even some pristine white fabrics that wouldn't look out of place in an Assassin's Creed game. As for Miles, he still has his signature red and black costume, as well as his own biomechanical getup, an armored look that probably has a Stark Technologies logo hidden on it, and even an outfit that makes him look right at home in a Power Rangers episode.</p><p>There'll likely be even more costumes when Marvel's Spider-Man 2 launches, and we'll update this list once we know what they are. Some of these costumes can also be unlocked by <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-2-preorder-guide/1100-6514512/\">preordering Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> ahead of its launch on October 20 for PS5.</p><p>Preorders for PlayStation's <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1815218501222258909?u1=subid_value\">limited-edition Marvel's Spider-Man 2 PS5 console</a>, <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1815218469265159628?u1=subid_value\">DualSense controller</a>, and console covers are still available, although these are moving very quickly whenever fresh stock arrives.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Advanced Suit</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4177613-spider-man-advanced-suit.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Peter Parker is still rocking his Advanced Suit in Marvel's Spider-Man 2, gifted to him by Otto Octavious before he went became Dock Ock, which features a familiar design when compared to his original classic suit as well as a more in-your-face spider icon. It's still a modernized take on Spider-Man's iconic look, and for Marvel's Spider-Man 2, the colors have been increased significantly for the PS5 adventure.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Miles Morales Classic Suit</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4177612-spider-miles-classic-suit.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Similar to Parker, Miles Morales is still wearing his Classic Suit as his default look, which has been given a sharp upgrade thanks to the focus on developing the game as a PS5 exclusive. It's sleek and functional, the red highlights give it an added pop, and it's full of hidden technology that gives Miles an edge in battle.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Symbiote Costume</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4177611-spider-man-symbiote-suit.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Insomniac's take on the Symbiote costume is one that mixes the alien creepiness of that organism with a modern spin on one of Spider-Man's most enduring fashion statements. Primarily black and with a big Spider-icon accentuating its design, the Symbiote costume looks like bio-organic armor on Spider-Man, a second skin of malevolent intent that slowly begins to corrupt the webhead as he becomes more brutal, dangerous, and potentially lethal when he jumps into the fray.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Arachknight Suit</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4152200-spidey-11.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Does Peter Parker have a hidden blade attached to his web-shooter? It certainly looks like it with this ensemble, as this costume looks like it was plucked right out of an Assassin's Creed animus. This costume will also be available in several color variations as part of the early preorder bonuses.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Aurantia Suit</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4152202-spidey-9.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Aurantia is described as a poisonous red-brown crystalline alcohol-soluble dye, which kind of explains the mask on top of a mask in this context. It also sounds cool and gives this costume a toxic edge. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Tactical Suit</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4152191-spidey-10.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>If being tactical means making yourself as visible a target as possible in front of heavily-armed hunters working for Kraven, then mission accomplished! </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>25th Century Suit</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4152192-spidey-8.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Even though he looks like he's wearing futuristic hockey pads, this costume still looks like a fun alternative to an insidious biomass that has the potential to slowly warp your personality and make you more violent. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Stone Monkey Suit</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4152193-spidey-7.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>It's a bold fashion strategy, Cotton. Let's see how it pays off for Spidey when he dives into battle while wearing a fur choker and a color scheme that would make professional graphic designers rage. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Apunkalyptic Suit</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4152194-spidey-6.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>We've had a Spider-Punk outfit in the past, now we're getting a post-Apunkalyptic costume that has everything you could ask for in end-of-the-world fashion. A weathered leather vest, a strap across the chest, and just enough space in the mask to let your trendy hair breathe. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Agimat Suit</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4152195-spidey-5.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Purple and gold is a <em>daring</em>fashion statement, and while this outfit does look a tad bit ostentatious, Miles is bound to turn a few heads here.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Shadow Spider Suit</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4152201-spidey-12.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Fun fact: Shadow Spider is a medieval makeover of Miles from another dimension, one in which he has a magical cloak, can teleport, and rolls a D20 whenever he needs to make an escape. Like Peter's ArachKnight costume, the Shadow Spider suit will also have several color variations available.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Red Spectre Suit</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4152196-spidey-4.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>This is the third costume on this list that features a hoodie design, and it never gets old. Especially with colors that pop this vividly. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Encoded Suit</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4152197-spidey-3.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Has Miles been moonlighting at Advanced Ideas Mechanics? Possibly, as the Encoded Suit looks like it was built with materials from a research lab populated with angry scientists dressed as beekeepers, but this armored getup looks dashing in comparison. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Biomechanical Suit</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4152198-spidey-2.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>When you watch way too many episodes of the Guyver anime, the end result is a Spider-Man costume that has exposed musculature, inset-like features, and looks 200% awesome. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Tokusatsu Suit</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4152199-spidey.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Holy Kamen Rider, Spider-Man! This Tokusatsu suit looks like it came straight out of a Japanese TV show, and with a design that slick, bullets will probably slide right off of it if they make an impact.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-marvels-spider-man-2-costumes-revealed-so-far/2900-4771/", "date_published": "2023-08-18T13:01:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "What's Even The Point Of Sports Game Reviews?", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">I've been playing <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/madden-nfl-24/\">Madden NFL 24</a> for a few days now, as have perhaps millions of others. The game's Deluxe Edition grants players three days of early access to the full game. There's also an EA Play trial that gives any subscriber up to 10 gameplay hours to do whatever they'd like before it officially launches on August 18. We can't determine how many people have taken advantage of these ways to play already, but we can safely assume it's a lot. You can ask virtually any one of those people what they think of the game this year. You can find countless hours of gameplay on YouTube, podcasts breaking it all down, and plenty of chatter on whichever social media platform you prefer, but you can't ask me yet. I'm not allowed to tell you. As I'm handling GameSpot's site review of this year's American football sim, I'm under embargo for a bit longer.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">That's weird, right? But in the sports gaming world, it's par for the course. Sports games continue to exist in a unique space where they dominate sales charts annually even as reviews for most of the popular series are mixed at best and negative at worst--and have increasingly come <em>after</em> launch due to the way these games' servers are unavailable until launch, even for critics. As a result, sports games seem to be review-proof. Feverish football, soccer, baseball, and basketball fans are, in the vast majority of cases, going to buy the latest version of their favorite series no matter what I or anyone says, especially if we're saying it after they've been tempted with the chance to just buy it and start playing already.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In the case of Madden NFL, <a href=\"https://chartedinterests.wordpress.com/2018/08/11/madden-a-metacritic-history/\">the series' aggregate review scores have been heading in the wrong direction for over a decade</a>, with critics routinely in agreement that the series isn't doing enough to merit a full release every August. I would even suggest that Madden does noticeably less than MLB The Show or NBA 2K in terms of sweeping and exciting changes from year to year, and those games are not always critical darlings themselves. But it doesn't matter one bit. Madden NFL 24 will <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/top-10-best-selling-games-of-2022-in-the-us/1100-6510556/\">undoubtedly finish as one of the best-selling games</a> in the US this year, squeezing in at the top with Call of Duty and EA FC, the new brand name for its series formerly known as FIFA.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/whats-even-the-point-of-sports-game-reviews/1100-6516988/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/whats-even-the-point-of-sports-game-reviews/1100-6516988/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-08-18T00:11:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}]
