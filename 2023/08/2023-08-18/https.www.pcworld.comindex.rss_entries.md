<p>In days of yore, you had to choose between a small, light laptop and one with power, including discrete mobile graphics cards. That was then, and this is now. 14-inch laptops split the difference between portability and power, making an ideal premium pick if price is no problem. Two such examples are the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/tech-black-asus-zenbook-pro-14-oled-ux6404vi-ds96t-content-creation-home-personal/p/N82E16834236455&amp;xcust=2-1-2033510-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Asus Zenbook Pro 14</a> and the <a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=14154&amp;GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Blade-Gaming-Laptop-Model/dp/B0C361JQJN?ascsubtag=2-1-2033510-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">Razer Blade 14</a>, both of which are packed with 14-inch screens and Nvidia RTX 4070 graphics. Gordon&rsquo;s putting them both to the test in a head-to-head shootout in the latest PCWorld video on YouTube. </p>



<p>The Zenbook Pro 14 is the sleeker and lighter of the two, possibly because it&rsquo;s more general purpose with its 14-core Intel Core i9-13900H, OLED screen, and the GPU running at 110 watts. Compare that to Razer&rsquo;s AMD-powered Ryzen 9 7940HS, a 240Hz LED screen, and a boosted 140 watts to the GPU, and you can see the latter is more geared towards gaming. That said, both of them are absolute monsters in terms of specs, especially at this size. </p>

<p>The guys run through these machines through their paces with Cinebench, Blender, Crossmark, GeekBench, PugetBench, Time Spy, Speed Way, V-Ray, and OctaneBench, as well as comparing both results with power throttling in mind. The two laptops are fairly comparable in terms of pure performance, especially watt-for-watt, though the Asus beats out the Razer in mult-core CPU tasks thanks to having that Intel six-core advantage. That&rsquo;s a big boost for multitasking and some rendering programs, but not such a big deal for gaming, where Razer&rsquo;s AMD hardware gets the edge. For a detailed breakdown, check out the full video. </p>

<p>Free game codes are a time-honored tradition when you&rsquo;re building or upgrading a gaming PC. Odds are pretty good that at any given time, a purchase of a new AMD or Nvidia graphics card will come with a free copy of whatever title is hot that quarter. Intel&rsquo;s latest selection of freebies includes the latest <em>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed</em> stab-em-up and an indie survival crafting game called <em>Nightingale</em>. The &ldquo;Gamer Days&rdquo; bundle runs from August 24th to September 4th in the United States. </p>



<p><em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/mirage&amp;xcust=2-1-2035620-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Assassin&rsquo;s Creed: Mirage</a></em> takes the Ubisoft series back to its Middle Eastern story roots, following assassin Basim Ibn Ishaq as he creeps around Bagdad to uncover conspiracies and ancient relics. The game is intentionally scaled-down, with a shorter and more focused main story in smaller maps that deliberately trades some of the wide-open RPG elements of the later titles for specific assassination story missions. It&rsquo;s set to be released on October 5th. </p>

<p>Intel&rsquo;s debut consumer graphics cards, the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1341464/intel-arc-a770-a750-graphics-card-xe-hpg-review.html">Arc A770 and Arc A750</a>, launched as a mixed bag last summer. On one hand, Arc GPUs delivered exceptional performance in modern DirectX 12 games and ray tracing out of the box, but on the other, performance in traditional DX9 and DX11 games faltered against the competition. In the months since, however, Intel&rsquo;s software engineers have been diligently patching the biggest holes, squashing bugs and rolling out drivers that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1424865/intel-arc-driver-performance-a-month-checkup.html">turbocharged performance in DX9 games</a> like <em>Counter-Strike</em> and <em>League of Legends</em>.</p>



<p>Today, Intel is announcing a big boost in DirectX 11 gaming performance on Arc graphics cards, and rolling out a new &ldquo;GPU Busy&rdquo; metric as well as its first enthusiast performance-measurement tool for gamers, dubbed PresentMon Beta.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="intel-arc-now-19-faster-on-dx11">Intel Arc: Now 19% faster on DX11</h2>



<p>In a briefing with press, Intel Fellow and graphics guru Tom Petersen proudly stated that &ldquo;our engineers completely rearchitected our DX11 stack,&rdquo; resulting in an average performance uplift of roughly 19 percent versus the Arc A750&rsquo;s launch drivers, when the GPU is paired with an Intel Core i5 CPU.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Arc gamescom update" class="wp-image-2034974" height="670" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/arc-dx11-frame-rates.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Intel</p></div>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Arc gamescom update" class="wp-image-2034979" height="664" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/arc-dx11-frame-rates-normalized.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Intel</p></div>



<p>As you can see in the charts above, the actual performance gains vary from game to game, but in general, DX11 games now get tens of frames more performance. In the games Intel tested, the uplift ranged from 5 percent faster performance in <em>Destiny 2</em>, all the way up to 33 percent in <em>Overwatch 2</em>.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Arc gamescom update" class="wp-image-2034976" height="668" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/arc-dx11-smoothness-normalized.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>In addition to faster overall frame rates, the 99th percentile frame rate is also an average of 20 percent improved in DX11 games now &mdash; meaning you get a much smoother experience overall.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Intel</p></div>



<p>Why the gulf? Petersen explained that Intel&rsquo;s driver acted as a sort of translator for DirectX API calls, sending instructions in a language that Arc GPUs understand. Intel&rsquo;s team worked hard to reduce the DX11 driver overhead previously found in Arc drivers, but more CPU-bound games still needed to wait for your processor to do its work first.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Arc gamescom update" class="wp-image-2034973" height="661" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/arc-gpu-busy-per-frame.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Intel</p></div>



<p>Petersen then introduced a new GPU metric, one Intel calls &ldquo;GPU busy.&rdquo; In a given displayed frame, the GPU is only busy for a portion of the action &mdash; the rest of it is divvied up by your CPU, driver overhead, and display. By measuring both the actual time it took a frame to render, and how long of that your GPU is busy, you can get a sense of how much &ldquo;other overhead&rdquo; is affecting your gaming performance.</p>



<p>The two <em>Overwatch 2 </em>performance screenshots below showcase both the hard work Intel has put into its DX11 drivers as well as the sort of insights GPU Busy can provide. The blue line shows how long each individual frame took to render; the yellow line shows how long the GPU was busy in that frame. The idea with frame time charts is you want to see the lines as smooth and flat as possible.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Arc gamescom update" class="wp-image-2034975" height="658" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/arc-ow2-launch.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Intel</p></div>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Arc gamescom update" class="wp-image-2034978" height="655" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/arc-ow2-dx11-driver.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Intel</p></div>



<p>As you can see, that wasn&rsquo;t the case for <em>OW2</em> when using the Arc A750&rsquo;s launch drivers; the blue lines bounce everywhere, delivering an inconsistent experience. Now, using the latest Intel drivers with rearchitected DX11 code, the game runs much more smoothly &mdash; even though the yellow &ldquo;GPU busy&rdquo; line remains at roughly 5 to 6 milliseconds with both drivers. Intel managed to fine-tune its drivers to cut back on the wild frame time spikes caused by other aspects of your system.</p>



<p>The game runs <em>much </em>better now, which we could measure using frame capture tools before, but the new GPU Busy metric gives us insight into <em>why.</em> Armed with that info, you can be better informed about whether your performance in a given game would improve with a CPU or GPU upgrade. If the GPU Busy time closely corresponds with overall frame times, either the game is perfectly balanced or it could benefit from a graphics card upgrade. Handy!</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Arc gamescom update" class="wp-image-2034977" height="663" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/arc-cpu-limited-frame.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>An example of when a frame or game is CPU limited rather than GPU limited.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Intel</p></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="presentmon-beta">PresentMon beta</h2>



<p>But how do you measure GPU Busy times? None of the traditional frame measurement tools like Nvidia Frameview, AMD&rsquo;s OCAT, or MSI Afterburner support the new metric. Enter Intel&rsquo;s PresentMon Beta software.</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s a thing nerds might know: All of those aforementioned frame measurement tools rely on a technology called &ldquo;PresentMon&rdquo; to measure when new frames are presented to your display. Here&rsquo;s what nerds might <em>not </em>know: PresentMon is an open-source Intel technology. Yes, really, even though Intel doesn&rsquo;t offer a nerdy frame measurement tool for Arc gamers.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Arc gamescom update" class="wp-image-2034972" height="670" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/intel-arc-presentmon-overlay.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>Intel&rsquo;s PresentMon Beta overlay.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Intel</p></div>



<p>That ends today. Intel&rsquo;s slick-looking <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://game.intel.com/us/story/intel-presentmon&amp;xcust=2-1-2034968-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">PresentMon Beta app</a> (available in both overlay and windowed form) delivers all the usual graphs, data, and measurements you expect to see in a modern GPU measurement tool &mdash; memory use, frame rates and times, voltages, frequencies, and more &mdash; in addition to the new GPU Busy metric. </p>



<p>You can configure the app to show numerical readouts or active, running charts of your chosen metrics, where you can also batch chosen metrics together in a <em>single </em>chart &mdash; perfect for having a graph in the corner of your screen showing both frame times and GPU Busy times, for example.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Arc gamescom update" class="wp-image-2034971" height="649" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/arc-presentmon-loadout-options.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Intel</p></div>



<p>Intel isn&rsquo;t yanking the rug out of the traditional PresentMon tools, so tools like Frameview and Afterburner will continue to work just fine. But it&rsquo;s also making the new PresentMon beta open-source, and better yet, it&rsquo;s just as hardware agnostic as the original, meaning it works with Intel, GeForce, and Radeon graphics cards alike.</p>



<p>Giggity. That gets my geeky synapses firing! The PresentMon Beta looks <em>deeply </em>useful for hardcore enthusiasts and hardware reviewers like yours truly.</p>



<p>But the bigger takeaway from today is that Intel is listening, and Arc graphics cards today run tangibly better than they did at launch (as our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1799919/intel-arc-gpus-how-much-improvement-has-intel-made-in-6-months.html">six-month Intel Arc performance check-in showed</a>). Now, DX9 and DX11 games play considerably faster <em>and </em>smoother on Arc then they did at launch &mdash; making the $250 Intel Arc A750, already our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/416006/the-best-graphics-cards-for-pc-gaming.html">favorite budget GPU for ray tracing</a>, an even better option than before. Intel&rsquo;s debut Arc graphics cards launched in a rough state, but there&rsquo;s no reason to be scared of them now.</p>



<p>Just make sure your PC supports<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394720/faster-gaming-frame-rates-for-free-resizable-bar-explained.html"> PCIe Resizable BAR</a>. Intel&rsquo;s graphics cards were designed to run on fairly modern systems and performance can get <em>really </em>sketchy if you slap them into a much older rig.</p>

<p>Super Mario, Zelda<strong> </strong>(or Link), Purple Tentacle, Sonic&mdash;these are just a few of the heroes who have inspired gamers for over 40 years. Some of the original gaming devices from Atari, Commodore, Nintendo, Sega &amp; Co. are rare today, but new editions have launched with more modern technology.</p>



<p>The same applies to the numerous classic games that still send retro fans into ecstasy. Here, too, there have been graphically polished revisions, especially for some Lucas-Arts titles, which reflect the enduring cult character of the games.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Die Steuerung der Retro-Spiele nehmen Sie in der Regel &uuml;ber die Tastatur vor, wobei Ihnen die Umsetzung der Controllertasten angezeigt wird. Alternativ k&ouml;nnen Sie oft auch ein regul&auml;res Gamepad anschlie&szlig;en." class="wp-image-2016584" height="871" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Retro-Games-Online.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>As a rule, you control retro games via the keyboard, where you are shown the implementation of the controller keys. Alternatively, you can often connect a regular gamepad.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG</p></div>



<p>In this guide, I show you how to get the original classic games of the breadbox era, as well as newer console titles, to run on your Windows PC. We offer you three possibilities: </p>



<ul>
<li>The simple way via your PC&rsquo;s browser</li>



<li>The somewhat more demanding way via the game collection on a USB drive</li>



<li>Last but not least, the profile solution in the form of a game console based on the Raspberry Pi</li>
</ul>



<p>But no matter which way you choose: Whether you save Princess Peach, finish off LeChuck, or successfully guide Giana through the dungeons depends only on your playing skills, not on a lack of technology.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="for-beginners-use-browser-emulation">For beginners: Use browser emulation</h2>



<p>Probably the easiest way to play retro console games on a Windows PC is via the browser. Providers such as <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://www.retrogames.cz&amp;xcust=2-1-2027852-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Retrogames</a>, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://www.playretrogames.com&amp;xcust=2-1-2027852-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Retro Games Online</a>, and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://www.webrcade.com&amp;xcust=2-1-2027852-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Webrcade</a> offer numerous Javascript emulations that can be run in the browser at the click of a mouse. For a better overview, the games can be filtered by console type. </p>



<p>With Retrogames and Retro Games Online, a direct search by title is possible; with Retrogames you can also search by genre; with Retro Games Online also by popularity. Retrogames also not only has console and home computer classics in its repertoire, but also old MS-DOS gems like <em>Alone in the Dark</em> and <em>Gabriel Knight</em>.</p>

<p>All providers allow you to operate the game with the keyboard. At the beginning of each game, the controller layout is displayed or you can call up the instructions by pressing a button. </p>



<p>A warning: It&rsquo;s not much fun to play a game like <em>Maniac Mansion</em> with the keyboard in the emulator. It is therefore best to get a standard gamepad for the PC that you connect via USB or Bluetooth. </p>

<p>Alternatively, some console gamepads can also be used on the PC, such as the Pro controller of the Nintendo Switch or the Dualshock 4 controller of Sony&rsquo;s Playstation 4. Both input devices can be connected to the PC either via USB cable or wirelessly via Bluetooth. All you have to do is set the controllers to pairing mode&mdash;in the case of the Switch Pro controller via the button next to the USB-C port, in the case of the Dualshock 4 via the PS and Share buttons&mdash;and establish the connection in the PC&rsquo;s Bluetooth menu.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Mit dem Tool Joy2key k&ouml;nnen Sie die Tastenbelegung eines angeschlossenen Gamepads anpassen und Spiele dadurch deutlich leichter und angenehmer steuern als mit der Tastatur Ihres PCs." class="wp-image-2016596" height="486" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Joy2key.png" width="694" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>With the Joy2key tool, you can adjust the key assignment of a connected gamepad and thus control games much more easily and pleasantly than with the keyboard of your PC.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG</p></div>



<p>To transfer the functions of the keyboard to the controller keys, use software like <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://joytokey.net/en&amp;xcust=2-1-2027852-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Joy2Key</a>. You can then easily map the directional keys of the keyboard to the directional pad and/or the joysticks of your gamepad, for example. To see which key of the gamepad you are currently assigning in Joy2Key (the buttons are only numbered consecutively), briefly press the key, its counterpart will then light up yellow in the program.</p>

<p>For those who don&rsquo;t want to play their classic games in the browser, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://batocera.org/&amp;xcust=2-1-2027852-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Batocera Linux</a> offers the option of launching console emulators from the USB stick on any PC. Batocera comes with emulators for the Nintendo Gameboy, the Sega Megadrive, and the C64. If you want more, you can also install additional emulators. </p>



<p><strong>And this is how it works: </strong>On the provider&rsquo;s website, select the desired end device, in our case &ldquo;Desktop, Laptop, NUC and Intel-based Apple Computers.&rdquo; The ISO is loaded immediately. A nice side note: At the bottom of the website, you will also find the Batocera image for 32-bit systems, so that you can use your very old hardware for a purpose.</p>



<p>Once you have downloaded the image from the manufacturer&rsquo;s website and unpacked it, all you need is a USB stick or an external USB drive with at least 8GB capacity&mdash;the actual size you need depends, of course, on how many games you want to store on it.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Das Spezial-Linux Batocera l&auml;sst sich auf einem USB-Stick installieren. Wenn Sie dann davon Ihren PC starten, k&ouml;nnen Sie die bereits vorinstallieren Spiele spielen &ndash; und Sie k&ouml;nnen weitere Titel hinzuf&uuml;gen, deren ROM Sie aus dem Internet geladen haben." class="wp-image-2016597" height="816" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Batocera.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>The special Linux Batocera can be installed on a USB stick. When you then start your PC from it, you can play the games that are already pre-installed&mdash;and you can add more titles whose ROM you have downloaded from the Internet.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG</p></div>



<p>Installing the Batocera image on the USB memory is done by the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/&amp;xcust=2-1-2027852-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi Imager</a> from the Raspberry Foundation. Load and start the tool, plug in the USB storage device, and select it under <em>SD card</em>. Then click on <em>Operating system&mdash;Select OS</em>, and at the very bottom on <em>Own image</em>. </p>



<p>Navigate to the Batocera image on your hard drive, select it, and then click on <em>Open</em>, <em>Write</em>, and <em>Yes</em>. Note: You can also select the image in its packed state in the Raspberry Pi Imager, but then the transfer to the storage medium may not be completed. We therefore recommend unpacking the image beforehand.</p>



<p>Once the USB medium has been written, boot your PC from it. You may have to adjust the boot sequence in the BIOS. Use the keyboard or a controller to operate the computer. A gamepad connected via USB is immediately recognized and ready for use. You can pair a Bluetooth gamepad via <em>Main Menu &gt; Controller &amp; Bluetooth Settings &gt; Pair Bluetooth Device Manually</em>. You can find information about the button assignment at <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://wiki.batocera.org/basic_commands&amp;xcust=2-1-2027852-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">https://wiki.batocera.org/basic_commands</a>.</p>



<p>Batocera comes with 14 games from different platforms. You can load additional titles, as well as emulators, into the program by selecting <em>Main Menu &gt; Updates &amp; Downloads &gt; Content Downloader</em>. However, you should only load one file at a time to avoid problems. To integrate your own ROM, use the integrated file explorer, which you call up with F1. </p>



<p>Under <em>ROMs </em>you will find folders for all games and systems. To add a game for the C64, for example, first check the supported ROM formats in the file &ldquo;info.txt&rdquo; in the folder &ldquo;c64.&rdquo; Once you have found what you&rsquo;re looking for on the internet, load the ROM onto a second drive and plug it into the PC. It will be recognized in Batocera&rsquo;s file explorer and you can then copy the file (usually as a ZIP archive) into the c64 directory. After a restart, the game appears in the overview and is ready.</p>

<p>If you own a Raspberry Pi, you can very easily convert the board computer into a game console for retro games. For example, the Batocera.linux described in the previous section is also available for various Raspi models. Other available game emulators for the Raspberry Pi are <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.recalbox.com/de/&amp;xcust=2-1-2027852-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Recalbox</a>, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://lakka.tv/&amp;xcust=2-1-2027852-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Lakka</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://retropie.org.uk&amp;xcust=2-1-2027852-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Retropie</a>. All three can be installed directly via the aforementioned Raspberry Pi Imager, and all three are also available for desktop PCs.</p>


<p class="cta wp-block wp-block-button"><a class="cta__btn" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.de/Raspberry-Pi-ARM-Cortex-A72-Bluetooth-Micro-HDMI/dp/B07TC2BK1X&amp;xcust=2-1-2027852-7-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">View Raspberry Pi 4 at Amazon</a></p>


<p>For use in the Raspi, insert a micro SD card into a connected card reader or integrated card slot on your PC and run the Raspberry Pi Imager on the PC. In the main view, select your memory card from the right drop-down menu <em>SD card </em>and on the left under <em>Operating system&mdash;Select OS</em> navigate to the desired emulator via <em>Emulation and game OS</em>. </p>



<p>Click on it, then specify your Raspi model for the appropriate software version and finish with <em>Write</em>. Once the process is complete, boot your Raspberry Pi from the micro SD card.</p>



<p>To operate the games, use either a keyboard or a gamepad, which you can connect via USB or Bluetooth, depending on the Raspi model and emulator, and configure with regard to the key assignment. You call up the corresponding menu with Recalbox via the Enter key; with Lakka via <em>Settings &gt; Input</em>; and with Retropie right at the first start.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Retropie ist ein Spieleemulator f&uuml;r verschiedene Systeme, der sogar ein paar Games mitbringt.

</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG</p></div>



<p>Recalbox already comes with numerous games listed by console, but also allows for expansion with additional ROMs. Lakka, on the other hand, only has a few games on board. If you want to download more titles and emulators, it is best to do so via <em>Main Menu &gt; Online Updater &gt; Content Downloader</em>. Here you can select games by console and then execute them via <em>Load Content</em>, whereby you can also determine the emulator used (<em>Core</em>). </p>



<p>More information on adding ROMs can be found at <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://lakka.tv/doc/ROMs/&amp;xcust=2-1-2027852-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://lakka.tv/doc/ROMs/</a>.</p>



<p>With Retropie, you must first load the game ROMs and the corresponding emulators: First set up the WLAN via <em>Configuration</em>. Then select <em>Retropie Setup</em> in the main menu, followed by the options <em>I Basic Install</em> and <em>Yes</em>. Then download the &ldquo;optional packages&rdquo; or the &ldquo;experimental packages&rdquo; in the same way under <em>P Manage Packages</em>, although the games do not always work here. </p>



<p>To display the games in the main view, press the start button on your controller and select the options <em>All Games</em>, <em>Favorites</em>, and <em>Last Played</em> in the menu that appears under Game <em>Collection Settings&mdash;Automatic Game Collections</em>, if desired.</p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> Information on download sources for legal game ROMs can be found in the box below. However, always make sure that the extensions are in the correct format and in the correct folder.</p>

<p>MSI is known for its radically powerful gaming machines. Right now, the latest offering is a semi-compact gaming laptop called the Cyborg 15. The price is right at just over $1,000 and the newer Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 GPU is a beast in the graphics department. That said, we had a few caveats about this particular machine. </p>



<p>The laptop holds back with the processor, which is an Intel Core i5 from the 12th generation. It&rsquo;s an older model, which means this machine falls behind a bit in processing tasks. According to my initial performance measurements, this computer seems to under-perform when compared to the competition. I get similar results from laptops with more power-efficient P-type Intel Core processors. Nitpicks aide, if it&rsquo;s pure graphics you&rsquo;re after, then graphics you&rsquo;ll get. </p>

<p>But once you&rsquo;re in the game, you&rsquo;ll notice a boost for the graphics card, compared to simpler computers on paper. It runs at a higher frame rate and it&rsquo;s possible to have more demanding graphics settings than I can manage in other computers for this price. Not much better, but marginally.</p>



<p>It should have been better, though, so maybe the cooling in the computer isn&rsquo;t efficient enough. In standard mode, it&rsquo;s automatic and AI controlled, and you can also choose between silent, balanced and high performance modes, but apart from the silent mode, I don&rsquo;t see performance being affected, just the fan noise, which can go from a subtle whisper to short loud bumps at very high volume.</p>



<p>That this is a gaming laptop is evident in many ways. A keyboard that glows blue, with arrow keys and WASD clearly marked. An angular design with wide sides to accommodate large cooling grilles. And a semi-transparent chassis that reveals components, screws and plates on the inside. It even says &ldquo;MSI TRUE GAMIN&rdquo; (yes, without the final G, or at least barely legible) in giant letters on the bottom.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI Cyborg 15 bakbelysning" class="wp-image-2017646" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/P_20230731_145118.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Clear blue light in the keyboard. </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mattias Inghe</p></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="msi-cyborg-15-not-very-heavy">MSI Cyborg 15: Not very heavy</h2>



<p>Is it necessarily stylish? No, but at least it&rsquo;s a bit different. The computer is a little thicker than most standard 15-inch computers without game graphics, but it&rsquo;s not excessively large or heavy. You&rsquo;ll be carrying just under two kilos. If you don&rsquo;t count the battery charger.</p>



<p>You get a comfortable keyboard with well-sized keys and clear click response. The backlight is a constant blue, and I don&rsquo;t see that there would be RGB control on the color. It&rsquo;s usually possible to download and install otherwise in MSI&rsquo;s MSI Center control software, but that option never appears. So it&rsquo;s blue or nothing. It is easy to adjust the brightness with a function button, so if you can tolerate the color, it works well.</p>



<p>The base is plastic, but the surface around the keyboard and mouse is a cool, matte lightweight metal that&rsquo;s comfortable to rest your wrists on. The mouse pad is comfortable, but the precision is a bit lacking at times; I have to press a bit on the surface for it to detect movement.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI Cyborg 15 sk&auml;rm" class="wp-image-2017644" height="1089" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/P_20230802_150849.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A screen with a high frame rate, but that&rsquo;s all it&rsquo;s good at. </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mattias Inghe</p></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="msi-cyborg-15-fast-but-pale-screen">MSI Cyborg 15: Fast but pale screen</h2>



<p>A monitor with 1080p resolution and 144Hz frame rate makes for a good gaming experience, even if response times are only semi-short. Good enough for most people, but a little too sluggish for a discerning e-sports player. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s also quite pale in color. It doesn&rsquo;t reach the srgb level but ends up at just over 60 percent of it, which means that colors are bland in both films and games.</p>



<p>The brightness of around 250 cd/m2 is also not much to cheer about and means that dynamics and contrast suffer, although it can be relatively dark in black pixels. The screen is actually best for everyday tasks such as browsing and reading documents. </p>



<p>The computer&rsquo;s speakers deliver rather weak sound. With mediocre pressure in the bass and lost details in the treble, they are acceptable at best. If the fans are blowing, the speakers may have to work hard to drown it out.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="msi-cyborg-15-charging-is-needed">MSI Cyborg 15: Charging is needed</h2>



<p>Battery life is never much to cheer about in a computer like this. I get barely two hours of runtime when playing demanding games, and maybe a full working day of surfing and emailing. But just maybe, with too much brightness and a little more load on the processor, the hours shrink. </p>



<p>You charge the battery with a separate ISO connector, and then have a USB-C port for data or monitor, as well as two USB Type-A ports, all three with USB 3 Gen 1 speed. You also get fixed gigabit networking, if you don&rsquo;t want to connect wirelessly. Its Wi-Fi 6 is fast and stable, but I miss the support for 6 GHz and Wi-Fi 6e that many of its competitors have.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s not a single important thing enough to lower the rating, but the MSI Cyborg 15 accumulates a list of things that either make my time with the computer less enjoyable or limit what it&rsquo;s good at. The exception is when I play games, when the power of the graphics card comes into its own. But a nicer screen would have been welcome even for that.</p>
