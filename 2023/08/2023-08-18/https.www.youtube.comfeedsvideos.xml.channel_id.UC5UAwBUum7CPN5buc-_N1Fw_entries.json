Some immutable distros give you easy access to containers so you can still use a full system with full write access.\n\nAnd there are a BUNCH of immutable distros: Fedora Silverblue, and Fedora Kinoite are basically Fedora Workstation, with GNOME or KDE, but with an immutable base. Vanilla OS is an Ubuntu based, soon to be debian based immutable distro that gives you access to any packaging format through containers. BLendOS does the same thing, but based on Arch. SteamOS, the linux distribution that powers the steam deck, and also my Linux gaming console / PC is also immutable.\n\nYou could also say that NixOS is an immutable distribution, since you only install things and modify configurations through a declarative config file that is used to build the system. And there are a lot more, like microOS from openSUSE, endlessOS, and more!\n\nSo in terms of advantages, immutable distros are just way more secure. Since you, the user can't modify the base system, and since the super user can't do it either, it also means any third party programs also can't modify that base system.\n\nAnother advantage is reliability. Since you can't tinker with the system files, you also have a much smaller chance of actually destroying your system.\n\nAnd in terms of maintenance, since you only use an updated system after a reboot, there is no risk of breaking something by updating it while it's running.\n\nBut how do I install anything if I can't write to the system? Most immutable distros work around that using universal packaging formats like flatpaks, snaps and appimages.\n\nBut that's not the only way to install stuff to an immutable distro. A lot of them actually still let you install packages to the system, in a dedicated layer. That's called \"layering\".\n\nWHat this means is that you still have access to the distro's repos of packages, and you can still elect to install some, but you won't use the usual package manager, but another dedicated tool. \n\nSome immutable distributions also use containers, generally with something like distrobox.\n\nAnother difference that can be considered a drawback is updating. Updates on immutable distros are never applied in place. When an update is available, they'll build another system image. So you end up with 2 systems; the one you're currently using, and the updated one, which is not currently active.\nAnd you only get the updates after you reboot onto that new system image.\n\nAnother drawback is the complexity of these systems. Everything you try to do is different: installing a package doesn't use your usual package manager. Applying updates isn't the same command, or requires you to reboot to actually use the updated system.\n\nImmutable distros are a different sort of system, with different tools to interact with things you might already know how to do.\n\nAre they the future? Probably not. For servers, they make a lot of sense. For regular users, they do have a lot of advantages, but they also have a bunch of limitations that require the use of workarounds.\n\nAnd so I don't think immutable distros will replace regular distros. They'll grow, and occupy a space next to let's call them \"mutable\" systems, but they'll probably never be the default thing most people use.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hiPFEUoUyI", "date_published": "2023-08-18T15:53:27+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/9hiPFEUoUyI/hqdefault.jpg"}]
