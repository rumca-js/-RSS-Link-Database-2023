On August 13, 2023, an explosion erupted in Shandong Province. A bank and a barbecue fish restaurant were blown up and seriously damaged. The glass and facade of the 2-story building are gone, and the ground was covered in debris. 
The road in front of the explosion was impacted. Vehicles were damaged. The blast struck pedestrians and vehicles on the road but so far, no specifics are available and the number of possible casualties is unknown. A witness said, “It's forceful. A white car far away from the site was knocked sideways.”
