		Vietnam’s e-contract platform is gaining popularity thanks to the widespread adoption of the country’s national ID cards, according to Vietnam’s Ministry of Industry and Trade (MoIT).

The Vietnam Electronic Contract Development Axis was <a href="https://vneconomy.vn/moit-establishes-vietnam-electronic-contract-development-axis.htm">launched</a> in 2022 to enable online attestation, authentication and lookups for business contracts. The platform is run by <a href="http://www.ceca.gov.vn">CeCA </a>(Certified e-Contract Authority), an electronic contract certification organization under MoIT’s Department of E-commerce and Digital Economy.

The country’s chip-based ID cards have been successfully used for authentication on the portal while the Ministry of Industry and Trade plans to continue working with the Ministry of Public Security on connecting and sharing data, Vietnam Plus <a href="https://en.vietnamplus.vn/chipbased-id-cards-proven-effective-in-econtract-authentication-agency/266449.vnp">reports</a>.

Vietnam started issuing chip-based ID cards in 2021 as part of its efforts to improve access to public services. One example is in <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202303/chipped-id-documents-expand-in-vietnam-with-passport-launch-healthcare-use">health care services</a>.

The government is also ramping up efforts to <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202203/jamaica-plans-biometric-id-card-issuance-pilot-pakistan-and-vietnam-upgrade-systems">scale its digital ID system</a>. The country’s draft Law on Citizen Identification aims to integrate more citizen data into the National Database on Population. This will allow citizens to access both public and private services by using ID cards and the National e-Identification Application (VNeID). The draft law is expected to be issued in October 2023 and will take effect on July 1, 2024.

The development of e-ID is another important policy proposed in the draft law. In April, the director of the Department of Legal Affairs and Administrative and Judicial Reform, Pham Cong Nguyen, said that data from citizens’ ID cards are being used to create their digital identity and corresponding e-ID account and e-ID card. At present, the electronic identification and authentication system is designed to accommodate 180 million visits a day to the VNeID app.

The Ministry of Public Security is working to ensure that the e-ID system is secure, Nguyen <a href="https://en.sggp.org.vn/vietnamese-citizens-to-own-e-id-cards-post101753.html">told Saigon News</a>. Only assigned people are allowed to access the personal data of citizens within the limit of their duty. The assigned personnel will need to obtain the approval of data owners via fingerprint or face authentication. This means that even if a citizen's ID card is stolen, criminals won’t be able to exploit the data stored on the card. Meanwhile, the victim can still use their e-ID card.

In March, the country also started issuing<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202303/chipped-id-documents-expand-in-vietnam-with-passport-launch-healthcare-use"> chip-based biometric passports</a>.

## BNSF Rail asks to settle or retry its BIPA damage award

		The defendant in one of the highest profile biometric privacy cases in the United States may want out of the case through a settlement.

BNSF Railway has been found guilty in Illinois of violating that state's landmark Biometric Information Privacy Act. It collected biometric scans of truck drivers entering its yards as a security measure but did not get consent from drivers entering Illinois BNSF facilities.

In case <a href="https://ecf.ilnd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/iqquerymenu.pl?364426">2019cv03083</a>, the rail company was ordered by a jury to pay fines totaling $228 million. BNSF appealed the verdict and <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/do-over-for-damages-in-228m-biometric-data-privacy-suit-maybe-not-for-the-law-itself">won</a> a retrial on the award, although not the verdict.

The retrial, if any, will open October 2.

Attorneys on behalf of BNSF now have asked the U.S. district judge for permission to leave the case and swap in a new law firm. The rail company's new firm, Jones Day, would "represent it in settlement negotiations with the plaintiff and, if necessary, a re-trial on damages," according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/bnsf-eyes-possible-settlement-swaps-law-firms-biometric-privacy-case-2023-08-16/">reporting</a> by the Reuters news agency.

The judge in the case, as have other judges in other BIPA cases, viewed the law as setting mandatory financial judgments, which would call for $228 million in penalties.

A subsequent BIPA case before the Illinois Supreme Court seems to define damages not as mandatory but as discretionary, meaning judges can impose smaller fines.

The law firm David Wright Tremaine has a concise <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/u-s-district-court-holds-that-bipa-s-5516716/">analysis</a> of this case and its implications.

		New Zealand’s Privacy Commissioner, Michael Webster, is considering the development of a regulatory code for biometric technologies. This Code of Practice for Biometrics would guide how organizations utilize and store biometric information, such as facial recognition data and fingerprints, which have raised significant privacy concerns in recent years.

In its investigation of the need for a code of practice to shield individuals from biometric information misuse while allowing government entities and businesses to use it safely, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC) gathered feedback on its original position paper in <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202212/new-zealand-commissioner-considers-establishing-biometrics-code-of-practice">2022</a>. Their public engagement report on the proposed biometric privacy regulation summarized the survey's results.

"The use of biometrics is growing and diversifying," Webster said. "We want to ensure New Zealanders and New Zealand businesses can harness the benefits of this technology but also be protected from potential harm."

If the OPC decides biometric use in New Zealand requires increased regulation, Webster emphasizes the importance of extensive public involvement in the dialogue. "We will be actively encouraging the public to take part in the consultation period because the use of biometric information will affect us all. Advances in technology can offer great benefits, but it’s important the benefits are enabled for all and the public are safeguarded against risk."

The OPC is now inviting a second wave of public feedback on the <a href="https://www.privacy.org.nz/assets/New-order/Resources-/Publications/Guidance-resources/Biometrics/Biometrics-discussion-document-summary.pdf">proposed rules</a> for this code of practice. According to their <a href="https://www.privacy.org.nz/publications/guidance-resources/biometrics-and-privacy/biometrics-papers/">website</a>, the feedback period ends Sunday, Aug. 27. The feedback will inform the Privacy Commissioner’s decision on whether to release a draft code for consultation. A decision should be announced later in the year.

## India imposes new ID verification requirement for sellers of SIM cards

		India government officials announced Thursday that new dealers of SIM cards are now subject to biometric ID verification.

This is the latest campaign to curb <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/india-fighting-fake-sims-despite-facial-recognition-tools-new-penalties">rampant fraud in India that involves SIM cards</a>. Officials want to identify everyone who has more than nine accounts, the maximum in India.

India’s central government has been struggling to reign in distribution of SIM cards obtained through forged <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/aadhaar">Aadhaar</a> and other ID documents as well as <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/india-fighting-fake-sims-despite-facial-recognition-tools-new-penalties">biometrics scams</a>. Fraudulent SIM cards are often used in fake call centers, illegal betting and sex racketeering.

"It will be mandatory for new dealers of mobile SIM cards to undergo a police verification and biometric verification. Registration will also be compulsory for all point-of-sale dealers now," says telecom minister Ashwini Vaishnaw.

Vaishnaw says that SIM dealers have been complicit when attackers bought mobile numbers in bulk and used the accounts to defraud people. In the future, those SIM dealers will be fined 1 million rupees (US$12,000), The Hindu <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mobile-sim-dealers-to-require-police-biometric-verification-it-minister/article67205398.ece">reports</a>.

As part of the campaign, businesses will no longer be able to buy SIM cards in bulk. Instead, corporate subscribers will need to go through a KYC check. Verification exemptions that have been granted to general government, defense and police bulk buyers will continue.

"Besides KYC of businesses, KYC of the person acquiring the SIM card will also be done," Vaishnaw says.

At the same time, the telecom ministry has updated KYC protocols for SIM replacements, adding face biometrics authentication as an option, in addition to thumbprint and iris biometrics.

Details on procedures and penalties have yet to be published, The Hindu <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mobile-sim-dealers-to-require-police-biometric-verification-it-minister/article67205398.ece">reports</a>.

Vaishnaw <a href="https://www.bqprime.com/business/government-bans-bulk-sale-of-sim-connections-to-curb-frauds">told</a> financial publication BQ Prime that 20 percent of sim cards sold have been misused.

In fact, the government has reported deactivating 5.2 million connections that were obtained by showing fraudulent IDs.

Facial recognition authentication has been growing as a tool for fending off SIM fraud despite <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/facial-recognition-helps-indian-authorities-identify-sim-fraudsters">privacy concerns</a>.

And the telecom ministry this year outlined <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/facial-recognition-helps-indian-authorities-identify-sim-fraudsters">plans to use</a> a tool called ASTR (AI and facial recognition-powered solution for telecom SIM subscriber verification) to analyze the entire Indian telecom subscriber database, amounting to 1.17 billion accounts. ASTR relies on photos obtained from telecom users’ KYC identity documents.

		The Philadelphia Phillies of Major League Baseball (MLB) are launching ticketless stadium entry with facial recognition.

Fans can register to use the service at dedicated lanes by submitting a selfie through the MLB Ballpark app. The images are converted into biometric templates and then deleted. Fans do not need to scan a ticket or their phone when entering. Security screening is carried out separately but simultaneously, reports <a href="https://omny.fm/shows/kywam-on-demand/mlb-to-launch-facial-recognition-ticket-program-at">KYW Newsradio</a>.

Groups can use the dedicated lane, as long as the person holding all the tickets is enrolled in the service. Only fans 18 years of age or older can enroll their face biometrics. The app also provides an option for users to “un-enroll.”

“<a href="https://www.mlb.com/phillies/ballpark/information/go-ahead-entry">Go-Ahead Entry</a>” is a pilot program initiated by the MLB, and launching at Citizens Bank Ballpark on Monday, August 21.

		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/tech5">Tech5</a> has been granted a patent by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for contactless fingerprint capture and biometric liveness detection on a standard mobile device.

The patent for “Contactless fingerprint capture using artificial intelligence and image processing on integrated camera systems” (<a href="https://www.freepatentsonline.com/11721120.html">11721120</a>) describes a series of machine learning algorithms based on neural networks, which detect the fingers, which side of the hand is being held up to the camera, and generate fixed-length fingerprint templates for biometric matching. A 3D depth map of the fingerprints is created, which delivers a resolution of 500 dpi and eliminates distortions in the image caused by the curvature of the fingers.

The system can be used for contactless-to-contactless fingerprint matching or contact-to-contactless matching, the patent document states. Tech5 also says the algorithms meet interoperability standards, and can be used for both enrollment and authentication.

The patent protects the technology used in the T5-AirSnap Finger software, according to the announcement.

“Our expert R&amp;D team is committed to advancing contactless fingerprint capture and liveness detection, integral to critical applications such as national enrollments, law enforcement, eKYC, and decentralized digital ID,” comments Tech5 Co-founder, Chairman and CTO Rahul Parthe. “We take pride in leading the way in this exciting new field of research.”

Tech5 took both first and second place in the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/tech5-claims-victory-in-contactless-fingerprint-liveness-competition">LivDet 2023</a> competition for contactless fingerprint software in June.

Parthe and other executives with Tech5 broke down the company’s vision, and <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/tech5s-subtle-but-fundamentally-different-approach-to-biometrics-for-inclusive-identity">how contactless biometrics capture fits</a> into it, in an interview with <em>Biometric Update </em>earlier this year.

## What is MOSIP’s role in digital public infrastructure? Gates Foundation explains

		The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the world’s largest charitable organizations, has published a <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/articles/mosip-digital-id-systems">primer</a> on <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/mosip-modular-open-source-identification-platform">MOSIP</a> (Modular Open-Source Identification Platform), summarizing the project’s achievements and placing them in the context of a global push for digital public infrastructure.

The Seattle-based foundation, which takes its direction from United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, has pledged US$10 million to support MOSIP, a technology developed for creating national digital ID systems. The project, based out of Bangalore, India, has found success among low and middle-income economies.

The original inspiration for MOSIP was India’s national digital ID system, Aadhaar, which launched in 2009 and triggered a surge of interest in digital IDs across the world. But other countries could not simply copy systems like Aadhaar, they had to rely on solutions from commercial vendors, which raised costs for national governments and exposed them to “<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/vendor-lock-in">vendor lock-in</a>.”

MOSIP was launched in 2018 as an alternative digital public good allowing everyone to use the software.

The Philippines was MOSIP’s first large-scale deployment. Since 2018, 11 countries, nine of them in Africa and two in Asia, have signed memoranda of understanding with MOSIP to pilot the system. More than 90 million people have been registered for MOSIP-based IDs in the Philippines, Ethiopia, and Morocco as part of national deployments.

The system had to be adapted to each country. MOSIP developed a <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/mosip-ready-for-next-phase-after-building-up-digital-id-ecosystem">thriving ecosystem</a> of more than 80 commercial vendors that could provide more choices to governments and keep prices low. The organization also provides free training and a marketplace where partners can showcase products to governments. MOSIP oversees an independent certification process for commercial partners and collaborates with global institutes like the Alan Turing Institute and Carnegie Mellon University to research privacy and security solutions.

The MOSIP team hopes that the system will register 1 billion people over the next decade.

The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation considers digital ID systems, including those created with the help of MOSIP, one of the pillars of <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/digital-public-infrastructure">digital public infrastructure</a> (DPI) as it helps to accelerate economic growth.

Individuals benefit because they can safely and cheaply conduct transactions. Businesses benefit because DPI stimulates the market and gives digital service providers an equal opportunity to compete. Entrepreneurs can use the infrastructure to innovate and launch new businesses. Through DPI, an estimated 16 to 19 million microbusinesses and small businesses globally could gain access to capital. Governments benefit because they can provide essential services to residents, the organization <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/articles/what-is-digital-public-infrastructure">says</a>.

## Algorithm for repelling future quantum data raids proposed by Google

		Google says there is "a clear path" to protecting public key cryptography against the moment when quantum computers are used for hacking.

The company is promoting its implementation of the method and has posted it. (<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202211/freevolt-toppan-each-partner-on-biometric-access-control-solutions-with-smart-cards">There are</a> <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202211/world-first-post-quantum-biometric-passport-security-demonstrated-by-infineon-partners">other ideas</a>.) At stake are all the world's collective databases of biometric and other identity data.

Google bases its conclusion on the creation of the <a href="https://pq-crystals.org/dilithium/">Dilithium algorithm</a> and the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/News/2022/pqc-candidates-to-be-standardized-and-round-4">standardization</a> of other recent public-key quantum-resilient cryptography.

Much of the cybersecurity community assumes that practical quantum computing, while unavailable now, will arrive before long and quickly tear through standard public-key cryptography like it was wet tissue paper.

Ideally, internet-scale resistance to quantum attacks will arrive before the attacks arrive, <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/08/toward-quantum-resilient-security-keys.html">says a post</a> by Google.

For that to happen, people will need new security keys after the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/fido-alliance">FIDO Alliance</a> standardizes post-quantum resilient cryptography and browser vendors adopt the standard.

That is going to be a lengthy process, even for a movement that's been around since the early 2000s.

Google's implementation combines strong nesting with classical and post-quantum cryptographical schemes. That is, a hybrid of the Ecdsa signature algorithm, which Google considers battle tested, and Dilithium.

Company executives say they hope some iteration of their proposal will get baked into the FIDO2 key specification and, of course, win the acceptance of browser companies.

They have invited the community to push their algorithm around in <a href="https://github.com/google/OpenSK">OpenSK</a>, Google's open-source implementation for keys written in Rust supporting FIDO U2F and FIDO2 standards.

## Researchers reveal PVC pipe spoof threat to voice biometrics

		Digital security engineers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison have discovered a weakness in automatic speaker identification systems that can be exploited using PVC pipes readily available at most hardware stores according to the <a href="https://news.wisc.edu/down-the-tubes-common-pvc-pipes-can-hack-voice-identification-systems/">UW-Madison news</a>.

The team, led by Ph.D. student Shimaa Ahmed and Kassem Fawaz, a professor of electrical and computer engineering, presented their findings last week at the USENIX Security Symposium in Anaheim, California. “The systems are advertised now as secure as a fingerprint, but that’s not very accurate,” says Ahmed. “All of those are susceptible to attacks on speaker identification. The attack we developed is very cheap; just get a tube from the hardware store and change your voice.”

The risks posed to voice biometrics by analog security holes could be far-reaching. Ahmed points out that many commercial companies already sell the technology, with financial institutions among their early customers. The technology is also used for AI-supported personal assistants like Apple’s Siri.

Ahmed led a team that conducted an experiment to assess whether altering the resonance of a voice could deceive a voice biometrics system. Ph.D. student Yash Wani was asked to help modify PVC pipes at the UW Makerspace to assist them in their project. Adjusting the length and diameter of pipes purchased from a nearby hardware store, the team replicated the same resonance as the voice they sought to imitate.

Eventually, the team created an algorithm that can determine the PVC pipe dimensions necessary to transform the resonance of nearly any voice to imitate another. In a test set of 91 voices, the researchers successfully deceived security systems with the PVC tube attack 60 percent of the time, while unaltered human impersonators only succeeded six percent of the time.

The success of the spoof attack can be attributed to a couple of key factors. First, because the sound is analog, it easily circumvents the digital attack filters of the voice authentication system. Second, the tube doesn't replicate the voice precisely; it solely mimics the resonance of the target voice. This level of mimicry is sufficient to confound the machine-learning algorithm, resulting in the misidentification of the attacking voice.

According to Fawaz, the project aims to inform the security community that voice identification is less secure than commonly believed. He states, “Generally, all machine-learning applications that are analyzing speech signals make an assumption that the voice is coming from a speaker, through the air to a microphone. But you shouldn’t make assumptions that the voice is what you expect it to be. There are all sorts of potential transformations in the physical world to that speech signal. If that breaks the assumptions underlying the system, then the system will misbehave.”

## UNICEF praises easier birth registration for Nigerians through digitization

		There are more parents in Nigeria now taking their children for birth registration as the country trials a digital birth registration system.

Many women in Benue state, one of the states chosen for the pilot, say the digital birth registration process appears easier for them as opposed to the manual system which is time-consuming, according to a UNICEF <a href="https://www.unicef.org/nigeria/stories/digitalisation-improves-birth-registration-nigeria">blog article</a>.

The Nigerian Population Commission (NPC), in <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/unicef-to-support-birth-registration-for-1m-nigerian-children-in-2023">collaboration with UNICEF</a>, recently launched a digital birth registration drive as part of efforts to narrow the existing child birth registration gap in the country.

Over 12 million children shall be registered during the pilot which involves about 22 of the country’s 36 states, an NPC official said in May.

On August 10, which was celebrated as the African Day of Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS), some of the women, including one Rhoda Egbe, took their children to the NPC office in Makurdi, the Benue state capital, to register them.

Mbakasen Imande, a registrar at office, says she has been impressed with the turnout since the digital birth registration began.

“It gives me pleasure to see that the birth of our children is promptly registered. The turnout and uptake is high, mothers bring their children to get them registered and they also collect the certificates,” she is quoted as saying.

Done via a digital app, the parents confirm that the birth registration process is less cumbersome and saves time. They also recognize the importance of registering their children after birth, with some of them saying they don’t want to repeat the mistakes made by their parents in the past.

Nigeria’s federal government announced in May that it had undertaken a project to set up <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/nigeria-to-set-up-digital-crvs-system-with-11m-private-sector-funding">a country-wide digital birth registration system</a>, with some of the funding expected from private sector partners.
<h2>More CRVS funding needed in Uganda</h2>
Across the continent, a budget advocate for CRVS programs has urged the Ugandan government to make available more funding for the vital exercise

In an <a href="https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/oped/commentary/bridge-funding-gaps-for-vital-registration-4332570">OpEd</a> for the Monitor, on the occasion of the 2023 Africa CRVS Day observed on August 10, Moses Talibita lauds the government in Kampala for its efforts in improving CRVS, but notes that the country has to look into the problem of “insufficient funding” which “impedes a robust civil registration system hampering the very progress we hope for.”

He says while Uganda make progress with its national ID program and its system of registration of births and deaths, it does so amid a huge funding deficit to the tune of about 16.9 billion Ugandan shillings (US$4.5 million) as well as other operational bottlenecks.

Talibita urges authorities to use the 2023 Africa CRVS Day theme to engender “actionable change by investing in the very systems that uphold rights and identity.” The theme was “Empowering communities: uniting for stronger civil registration and vital statistics systems.”

The writer also notes that such a big funding deficit also makes it difficult for the country to effectively produce other important ID credentials such as national ID cards and death certificates. He also recommends that the CRVS system be made more inclusive by bringing on board many more grassroots stakeholders.
