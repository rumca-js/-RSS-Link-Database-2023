It's gotten worse as Biden has gotten worse (and the women h<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/thanksgiving-karate-little-girl" target="_blank">ave become little kids</a>). But this has always been considered Joe being Joe. One former US Senator, Scott Brown, revealed on a podcast what he told Joe after the then vice-president got handsy with Brown's wife.</p><p>Let's cut through the malarky. This isn't a thing that ring-wing bloggers are alleging. Biden's gropey ways were such a known problem, OTHER DEMOCRATS were using it against him in the Democrat primary. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-apology-video" target="_blank">He was forced to issue an apology</a> if you were offended by his bad touch.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>

<p>The former vice president had his fingers crossed. When Scott Brown was elected Massachusetts Senator (after Ted Kennedy was sent to Hell), Brown claimed on <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/politics/ex-senator-warned-biden-hed-kick-the-sht-out-of-him-after-getting-handsy-with-wife/" target="_blank">Tom Shattuck’s Burn Barrel</a> that he had to have words with Biden.</p><blockquote>I told him I’d kick the shit out— I told him to stop, so yes ... [Biden] didn’t act the way I thought he should. We called him on it. That’s it.</blockquote><p>The odd thing is Brown said it while also being DEFENSIVE of Biden. The former Senator enjoyed the time he spent with Biden thirteen years ago. The Joe we see now? That's not Joe. Brown says without evidence (other than his eyes, our eyes,  and the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/hunter-biden-book-dementia" target="_blank">eyes of other Biden critics</a>):</p><blockquote>“We all know people who have dementia and have the beginning of Alzheimer’s. He’s got it. It’s the walk. It’s the way he’s mumbling, his anger outbursts. It’s a shame that we can’t do better."</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>Democrats are stuck with their guy. It's either an eighty-year-old whose brain is 69% tapioca that they can use as a sock puppet or Kamala Harris. A woman who started off 2020 implying Joe Biden a racist who probably sexually assaulted an aide. Even leftist, progressive, half-a-commie, slightly right of Marx democrats look at Kamala and are all like... lol, no.</p><p>It's a shame Brown didn't swing on Biden. It would have been hilarious to watch corporate journalismers leap to Biden's defense claiming, "Yeah, but did you see what Mrs. Brown was wearing?"</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Police issue statement re: autistic teen who was dragged out of her house for saying a cop looked like a "lesbian"

Good news! The teen will NOT be charged for saying words in her own home. God save the King.</p><p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/police-arrest-autistic-teen" target="_blank">If you missed the story on Thursday</a>, there are two key things you need to know. The first is that when the department dropped the statement on X, it included the following:</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>The other is the source material. Please note the mother had deleted her original video and reuploaded it, because too many people were fighting in the comment section. That means there were people arguing on THE MOTHER'S SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT that these actions were justified:</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.westyorkshire.police.uk/news-appeals/update-social-media-video-leeds" target="_blank">The statement reads</a> that the 16-year-old girl was arrested on suspicion of a homophobic public order offense. What they left out is the reason the police were at the house was that <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12392871/Autistic-girl-16-arrested-dragged-screaming-home-Leeds-12-officers-saying-female-cop-looked-like-lesbian-nana.html" target="_blank">they got a report from a relative that the girl</a> was drunk in public. They didn't charge the girl with that. They drug her out of the house and arrested her because while "investigating" that incident, she said something to a cop and the cop wouldn't calm down.</p><blockquote>West Yorkshire Police has now reviewed the evidence and made the decision to take no further action. This concludes the criminal investigation and immediately releases the girl from her bail. Her family has been updated. West Yorkshire Police’s Professional Standards Directorate is continuing to carry out a review of the circumstances after receiving a complaint in relation to the incident.</blockquote><p>The review of the circumstances should be easy: </p><p>1) the UK does not have free speech, and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/uk-arrest-social-media-posts" target="_blank">has less free speech than Russia</a>, </p><p>2a) a lesbian cop was in a bad mood that day, possibly on the day of the month, or... </p><p>2b) a lesbian cop is still in the closet and lashed out at the autistic teen, or... </p><p>2c) a straight cop is a homophobic bigot and freaked out when a teen said she looked gay.</p><p><span></span>Assistant Chief Constable Oz Khan goes on to say (emphasis mine): </p><p>“We recognise [editor's note: they spell things silly over there] the significant level of public concern that this incident has generated, and we have moved swiftly to fully review the evidence in the criminal investigation which has led to the decision to take no further action. Without pre-empting the outcome of the ongoing review of the circumstances by our Professional Standards Directorate, we would like to reassure people that <strong>we will take on board any lessons to be learned</strong> from this incident."</p><p>No, you won't.</p><p>This is the UK. This is how it is. All of Europe, if we're being honest. But specifically in the UK, it's not the first time we've seen a ludicrous arrest. In 2022, a man was arrested for a social media post that, quote, "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/man-arrested-for-social-media-post" target="_self">caused someone anxiety.</a>" That was the excuse he was given.</p><p>In 2023, the UK started arresting people for <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/prayer-army-vet-fined" target="_self">praying in public</a>. No, seriously. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/praying-arrested-silence" target="_self">Praying in public</a>. It's illegal when it's done too close to an abortion clinic.</p><p>Dragging an autistic teenager out of her house for saying words in that house is only the most extreme. So far. There are still four and a half months to go this year.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Lizzo dropped from Super Bowl consideration amid alleged fat-shaming, sending tremors and quakes throughout entertainment

<img src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=34865913&amp;width=600&amp;height=600&amp;coordinates=387%2C0%2C295%2C0" /><br /><br /><p><p><em>Get all your latest LWC swag at <a href="https://www.crowdershop.com" target="_blank">CrowderShop.com</a>!</em></p><p>The heavy allegations against Lizzo have blown a plus-sized hole in what used to be a promising career and/or contrived media narrative. Once a body-positive role model, allegations of her being a fat fat-phobic fat-shamer -- and one who (allegedly) makes her dancer eat bananas that come out of strippers' hoo-has -- has caused everything to come crashing down around her. Now the artist has been dropped from the Super Bowl, causing a seismic quake in the entertainment industry. </p><p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-12389703/Lizzo-abuse-super-bowl-dropped-save-career-sinking.html" target="_blank">Daily Mail</a> is reporting the singer is no longer under consideration to have any involvement at next year's Super Bowl. Whether she is being replaced with an artist football fans like or Dylan Mulvaney performing his new one-woman cabaret is unclear.</p><blockquote>Now, an NFL insider exclusively tells DailyMail.com that the ensuing backlash over the allegations has prompted the organization to immediately drop Lizzo from Super Bowl Halftime Show contention - having previously had her name in the mix as one of the front-runners for the 2024 spectacle.<br /> <br />'Talks of Lizzo being a part of the Halftime festivities, or performing the National Anthem, are dead now that she is surrounded by scandal,' the source said in the wake of the accusations - which Lizzo vehemently denies.</blockquote><p>Guilty until proven innocent. Amirite? Hey, I don't make the rules.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="21324" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=34866438&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>The drama for Lizzo began when<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lizzo-lawsuit" target="_blank"> three former dancers filed a lawsuit</a> alleging a hostile work environment. Lizzo questioned her dancer's "commitment," which in the dancing world is considered saying "bitch, you chunky." Think of the movie <em>Knocked Up</em> when they couldn't tell Katherine Hieigel to lose weight. Just for her to look at a number on a scale, and come back when that number is twenty less.</p><p>Odd that someone who <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lizzo-body-shamer-instagram" target="_blank">demands you celebrate them</a> in a bikini even though their blood type is tapioca would attack someone else's beautiful and brave body type. The old adage remains true. It's not the crime as much as the hypocrisy.</p><p>Also, the degeneracy. <a href="https://pagesix.com/2023/08/01/lizzo-sued-by-dancers-for-allegedly-forcing-them-to-watch-sex-shows/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Another allegation highlights</a> a trip to Amsterdam where “… things quickly got out of hand. Lizzo began inviting cast members to take turns touching the nude performers, catching dildos launched from the performers’ vaginas, and eating bananas protruding from the performers’ vaginas.”</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="b13d4" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=34866605&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Since then six more employees have filed similar complaints, causing the total number to swell up to nine. Not unlike Lizzo's cankles when she has been on her feet too long.</p><p>The artist maintains her innocence, slamming "false allegations" while thanking everyone "who has reached out in support to lift me up during this difficult time." It is unclear if Lizzo will ever recover from this. We here at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website wish her well in her future endeavors.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
