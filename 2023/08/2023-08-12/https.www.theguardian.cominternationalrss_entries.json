He was just 36 minutes into his debut for Real Madrid and the Englishman already had his first goal and the photo to go with it. The new man and his new teammates, running to join him: Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni, then Dani Carvajal, then Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, and then the rest of them, all in white. So this is what it\u2019s like.</p><p>This is what he\u2019s like too. The friendlies impressed, but this was the real thing, at a real stadium redolent with history and tradition, few better places to start. Away, sure, but this is a classic, against Athletic Bilbao, one of only three teams never relegated. It was marked with an assured 2-0 win, a clean sheet for Andriy Lunin, standing in for the injured Thibaut Courtois, at least until Kepa Arrizabaga arrives on loan, and a debut goal for Bellingham delivered early.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/12/athletic-real-madrid-la-liga-match-report\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/12/athletic-real-madrid-la-liga-match-report", "date_published": "2023-08-12T22:22:13+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "Sydney\u2019s $344m gallery has been open for eight months \u2013 so why doesn\u2019t it have a name?", "description": "<p>Political intervention and conflicting advice over Indigenous language use are at the heart of the impasse over the addition to the Art Gallery of NSW</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=cvau_sfl\">Get our weekend culture and lifestyle email</a></li></ul><p>Eight months <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/dec/03/the-sydney-modern-project-is-finally-open-has-the-art-gallery-of-nsws-344m-expansion-paid-off\">after opening</a>, New South Wales\u2019s largest cultural construction investment since the Sydney Opera House remains nameless, with political intervention and conflicting advice over language behind the deadlock.</p><p>The $344m addition to the Art Gallery of NSW remains colloquially known as Sydney Modern, the name of the Sanaa-designed construction project which began in 2015.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/aug/13/sydney-art-gallery-of-nsw-no-name-why-modern\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/aug/13/sydney-art-gallery-of-nsw-no-name-why-modern", "date_published": "2023-08-12T20:00:27+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "NFL great Tom Brady meets Birmingham fans in pub before match", "description": "<ul><li>NFL great mingles with locals ahead of match at St Andrews</li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/12/championship-roundup-coventry-middlesbrough\">Birmingham edge Leeds on Jutkiewicz\u2019s stoppage-time goal</a></li></ul><p>NFL great Tom Brady got to know some of the locals ahead of his first home match as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/03/tom-brady-birmingham-city-minority-owner-nfl-great\">minority owner</a> of English soccer team Birmingham City.</p><p>Brady <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KELSEARAVENHILL/status/1690317500104212480\">made an appearance at The Roost</a>, a pub near St Andrew\u2019s stadium, before Birmingham\u2019s game against Leeds in the second-tier Championship on Saturday</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/12/tom-brady-birmingham-city-fans-pub-visit\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/12/tom-brady-birmingham-city-fans-pub-visit", "date_published": "2023-08-12T19:02:54+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "George Ford leads England to victory against Wales but Owen Farrell sees red", "description": "<ul><li>England 19-17 Wales</li><li>Borthwick could be without captain for World Cup opener</li></ul><p>A relieving, bonkers win for a depleted England, but one that came at a major cost.

It\u2019s why the longstanding clich\u00e9 that likens human beings to onions holds up so well. But, occasionally, an anecdote can succinctly capture the essence of a person. I found this to be the case for one such story about basketball legend Pau Gasol. Barcelona, Spain, in the year 1991: an 11-year-old Gasol, the son of a doctor mother and nurse father, and an avid NBA fan from afar, watches with the rest of the world as his hero Magic Johnson <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMMWLS8D4OU\">announces that he is HIV-positive</a> \u2013 a diagnosis which, at the time, is perceived as a death sentence.
