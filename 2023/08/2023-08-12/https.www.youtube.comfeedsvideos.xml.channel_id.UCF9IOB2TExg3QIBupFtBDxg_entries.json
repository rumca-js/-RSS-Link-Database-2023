A system beset by conflicts of interest\n\nMHRA approach to patient safety requires a radical overhaul encompassing legislative changes on reporting and, \n\nin a system beset by conflicts of interest, changes to how the MHRA is funded. \n\nA failure to act will only lead to more harm.\n\nCDC latest guidelines\n\nhttps://twitter.com/FDAHealthEquity/status/1689313362717417472\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/COVID-19-immunization-schedule-ages-6months-older.pdf\n\nMPs warned Yellow Card system and vaccine damage payment scheme failing injury victims\n\nhttps://appgpandemic.org/news/yellow-card\n\nhttps://appgpandemic.org\n\n17 July 2023\n\nThe Pandemic Response and Recovery All-Party Parliamentary Group,\n\nfailings of the Yellow Card system\nProfessor Carl Heneghan\n\nProfessor of Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford, \n\nDirector of the Centre for Evidence Based Medicine and an NHS General Practitioner working in urgent care.\n\nUnder-reporting of adverse drug reactions to the Yellow Card system could be as high as 98%,\n\nhttps://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk\n\nmeaning the ability to detect signals and assign causation is substantially hindered. \n\nIn theory, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) relies on the early warning system provided by Yellow Card reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs),\n\nto signal possible harms from pharmaceuticals. \n\nIn practice the system is woefully inadequate, much too complicated and is failing. \nIf you consider that ADRs are a major cause of hospital admissions, 6.5%, then Yellow Card reports represent a valuable source of information,\n\nnot only to protect public health but reduce the cost to the health system, which can only be a good thing. \n\nBut the ability to detect signals and assign causation are hindered by substantial problems, not least under-reporting. \n\nIn 2018 the MHRA \u201cestimated that only 10% of serious reactions and between 2 and 4% of non-serious reactions are reported\u201d \n\nMHRA\n\nReporting rates for covid vaccines are better due to higher public awareness, \n\nthere appears to be no evidence base for this heightened awareness.\n\n\nShould the MHRA, our regulatory body, be primarily funded by fees derived from services to the pharmaceutical industry? \n\nWe could improve the reporting system and the MHRA has published various strategies and proposals to do so but fine words butter no parsnips. \n\nThe bottom line is that the MHRA has failed in its remit to keep patients safe. \n\nPeter Todd\n\nSolicitor acting for 43 who suffered blood clots as a result of AstraZeneca vaccination, \n\nVDPS\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/vaccine-damage-payment\n\n\nis letting down those with injuries and families of those who died as a result of their injury, \n\nwith some applications taking more than 18 months.\n\n\u201cI have dealt with such cases for many years, \n\nincluding acting for 86 people who contracted narcolepsy due to the 2009 Pandemrix swine flu vaccine. \n\nI have noticed many parallels between that and the Covid vaccine, \n\na hasty roll out of an under-tested emergency vaccine using new technology,\n\nand for which the government gave an indemnity against any civil claims. \n\nVDPS\n\nas of 20 June, of 6,183 applications for compensation, \n\nit has determined 2,101, \n\n33% so far,\n\nand 139 applications have been waiting for more than 18 months, excessively long despite additional resources.\nPandemic Response and Recovery APPG Co-Chair Esther McVey\n\n\u201cWhat we heard has been extremely concerning. The entire system is failing patients, from start to finish. \n\nMHRA\u2019s approach to patient safety, the inadequacy of the Yellow Card system \u2026. are all compromised and that is severely compromising patient safety.\n\n\u201cOne serious concern is the knock on effect on people\u2019s inclination to have vaccines generally. \n\nMany could be dissuaded from taking other vaccines, \n\nwe have all seen the recent warnings of a measles outbreak in London due to low levels of vaccination. \n\nThese vaccines seem to have a disproportionate adverse reaction rate, with injuries including strokes, blood clots, heart attacks, amputations and neurological conditions. \nSo a reporting system that misses as many as 98 out of 100 adverse reactions, inevitably misses safety signals. \n\nPandemic Response and Recovery APPG Co-Chair Graham Stringer MP\n\nI think the example of the time lag between AstraZeneca being suspended in Denmark, Norway and Iceland and being suspended here is a case in point. \n\nWhy did the MHRA not act when its scientific review of UK reports of blood clots with lowered platelets concluded strong evidence of a link with AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine?", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGmOLkmfWIU", "date_published": "2023-08-12T15:29:50+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/kGmOLkmfWIU/hqdefault.jpg"}]
