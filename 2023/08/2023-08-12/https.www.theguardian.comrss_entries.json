The end was as swift and conclusive as the previous six rounds had been pedestrian. It was a reminder, after a dreary prelude, that Joshua still retains serious punching power.</p><p>Helenius was the more aggressive fighter in the opening round, without landing any notable punches, as Joshua opted for a cautious approach against his marginally taller opponent from Finland. Joshua was more purposeful two minutes into the second round as he threw a brief flurry of punches which forced Helenius back against the ropes. They swapped respectful nods at the bell as if to thank each other for the lack of punishment in those first six minutes of wary sparring.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/13/anthony-joshua-fells-robert-helenius-with-vicious-seventh-round-knockout\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/13/anthony-joshua-fells-robert-helenius-with-vicious-seventh-round-knockout", "date_published": "2023-08-12T23:11:14+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Another interest rate rise?

But almost 20 years later, drillers on the hunt for fossil fuels confirmed the accidental discovery: hundreds of feet below the arid earth of west Africa lies an abundance of naturally occurring, or \u201cwhite\u201d, hydrogen.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/12/prospectors-hit-the-gas-in-the-hunt-for-white-hydrogen\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/12/prospectors-hit-the-gas-in-the-hunt-for-white-hydrogen", "date_published": "2023-08-12T15:00:21+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Ukraine fires missiles at Kerch Bridge connecting Crimea to Russia", "description": "<p>Kyiv takes war to Russia with multiple strikes on Crimean peninsula targets, many of which were shot down</p><p>Ukrainian forces fired three missiles at the bridge connecting occupied Crimea to Russia, forcing Russian authorities to cover the structure in white smoke to deter further attacks and prompting a furious threat of retaliation.</p><p>In the latest example of Kyiv taking the war to Russia, multiple guided S-200 rockets were fired at Kerch Bridge but they were seemingly shot down by local air defences.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/12/ukraine-fires-missiles-at-kerch-bridge-connecting-crimea-to-russia\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/12/ukraine-fires-missiles-at-kerch-bridge-connecting-crimea-to-russia", "date_published": "2023-08-12T14:54:58+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "History-making Matildas stand up on near-perfect evening of high drama | Jack Snape", "description": "<p>Quarter-final win over France was an occasion of soaring spectacle for Australia, and the stakes could not have been higher</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/12/womens-world-cup-2023-matildas-australia-vs-france-match-report-review-scores-results-suncorp-stadium-brisbane\">Australia 0-0 France (7-6 on pens)</a> | <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/12/australia-france-womens-world-cup-quarter-final-player-ratings\">Player ratings</a> | <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/12/womens-world-cup-2023-matildas-australia-vs-france-mackenzie-arnold-suncorp-stadium-brisbane\">Reaction</a></li></ul><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve made history.\u201d These are big words.
