China's Central Weather Bureau forecasts that Typhoon Khanun will enter China on August 12, with heavy or torrential rain in the northeastern region. 
As a result of the attack of Typhoon Doksuri, not only Beijing and Hebei suffered severely, but the situation in the Northeast is also disastrous, with countless people and animals being drowned, the victims rendered homeless, houses collapsed, and farmland washed away. The economic loss is huge. The gruesome scene is comparable to an apocalyptic drama.
