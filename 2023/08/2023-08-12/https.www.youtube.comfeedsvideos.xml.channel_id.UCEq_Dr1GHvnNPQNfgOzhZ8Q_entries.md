The bit is Oppenheimer but it’s a Saturday Morning cartoon, which will not make sense for half the audience who didn’t grow up on saturday morning cartoons. All of whom I’m assuming also didn’t grow up with the testing of the nuclear bomb. I did. I’m actually like super old. I was there. With Josh Peck.
