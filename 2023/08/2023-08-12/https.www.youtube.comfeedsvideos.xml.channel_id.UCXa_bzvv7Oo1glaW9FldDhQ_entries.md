Of all the gacha games out there, very few offer open worlds with stylish presentations and intriguiging  action RPG combat. Tower of Fantasy from Hotta Studio is the first real competitor in that sense and debuted a year ago on PC. It's finally available for PS5, and certainly not without its issues.

Despite an intriguing set-up, sci-fi aesthetic and decent combat, its story-telling and characters leave much to be desired. The UI is a nightmare to navigate, the Simulacra feel pointless beyond their weapons, and the game does a poor job of bringing you up to speed with new content.

That's not counting the excessive monetization, unscaled art assets, and technical issues. Check out our review for Tower of Fantasy to learn more.

There’s plenty of mystery surrounding NeatherRealm’s next upcoming entry in their storied Mortal Kombat series. Another timeline reboot is on the cards, this time focusing on peace, tranquility, and stability. 

Events appear to have swung back to an era prior to the very first Mortal Kombat game, but most unexpectedly in Mortal Kombat 1 we’re seeing former foes as allies. Surely things won’t pan out this way, and history will serve to repeat itself. 

How and in what manner is something we can only speculate on for now, so in this feature five potential outcomes for Mortal Kombat 1 are discussed – although they are firmly rooted in theory for now there’s good evidence floating around that one or more of these theories will prove true.
