Tower of Fantasy from Hotta Studio is the first real competitor in that sense and debuted a year ago on PC. It's finally available for PS5, and certainly not without its issues.\n\nDespite an intriguing set-up, sci-fi aesthetic and decent combat, its story-telling and characters leave much to be desired. The UI is a nightmare to navigate, the Simulacra feel pointless beyond their weapons, and the game does a poor job of bringing you up to speed with new content.\n\nThat's not counting the excessive monetization, unscaled art assets, and technical issues. Check out our review for Tower of Fantasy to learn more.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfT2zDs0svw", "date_published": "2023-08-12T19:30:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/RfT2zDs0svw/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "30 BEST First Person Shooters of All Time (2023 Edition)", "description": "Ever since the early 90s, the first-person shooter has continued to grow in popularity with each passing. A genre that was once limited to arena shooters now encompasses a diverse range of flavors including but not limited to post-apocalyptic RPGs, multiplayer shooters, narrative-driven linear thrill rides, and much more. \n\nWhile there has never been a shortage of great first-person shooters, but only a few dozen games have remained with us after all these years. \n\nWith this feature, we will be running down 30 of the best first-person shooters of all time. We\u2019ll be discussing how fun the game was when it released, how influential it was to the genre as a whole, and how well it stacks up to this date.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JquDn-EYdc4", "date_published": "2023-08-12T15:45:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/JquDn-EYdc4/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Mortal Kombat 1 Ending - 5 Potential Ways It Can Conclude", "description": "There\u2019s plenty of mystery surrounding NeatherRealm\u2019s next upcoming entry in their storied Mortal Kombat series. Another timeline reboot is on the cards, this time focusing on peace, tranquility, and stability. \n\nEvents appear to have swung back to an era prior to the very first Mortal Kombat game, but most unexpectedly in Mortal Kombat 1 we\u2019re seeing former foes as allies. Surely things won\u2019t pan out this way, and history will serve to repeat itself. \n\nHow and in what manner is something we can only speculate on for now, so in this feature five potential outcomes for Mortal Kombat 1 are discussed \u2013 although they are firmly rooted in theory for now there\u2019s good evidence floating around that one or more of these theories will prove true.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGYDvYFpLbo", "date_published": "2023-08-12T09:45:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/EGYDvYFpLbo/hqdefault.jpg"}]
