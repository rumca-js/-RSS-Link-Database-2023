Waterford Crystal is an over-200-year-old company that makes high-end crystal glassware in Waterford, Ireland. Household pieces like wine glasses cost about $150, but vases and other pieces go for well over $1,000. Waterford made the famous Times Square Ball and also makes trophies for events like the PGA Tour, Formula 1, and the People’s Choice Awards. It’s not just the name that fetches high prices, however, but the uniqueness of the patterns as well as the skilled, handmade craftsmanship and eight years of apprenticeship that go into each piece.
