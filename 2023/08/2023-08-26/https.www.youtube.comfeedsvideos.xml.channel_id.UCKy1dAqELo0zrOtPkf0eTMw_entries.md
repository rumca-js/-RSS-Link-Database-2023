In today's Daily Fix:
Starfield's public release is almost here, and if you're clearing your schedule to play it, you may need to clear an extra hundred or so hours. According to Bethesda's Pete Hines, Starfield doesn't really get going into after you've finished the main storyline. That's actually par for the course with open-world Bethesda games, as games like The Elder Scrolls and Fallout have dozens, if not hundreds more hours' worth of content outside of the story quests. In other RPG news, Baldur's Gate 3's first patch is here, and yes, Xbox owners will be getting updates, too. Larian is finally getting to release the game on Xbox Series X and S, however the lower-spec'd Series S will be missing a much-touted feature. Could this be an option for developers going forward, if they're having trouble getting their games to run on the Series S? Let us know what you think in the comments. This episode is brought to you by Universal Orland Resort.

While both #adultswim and the crew behind #RickandMorty have a lot of confidence in the upcoming season, fans will have to just wait and see what we can expect come October 15th. Plus some spicy Dune Part 2 news you might be interested in hearing. And some somber wrestling news regarding WWE Superstar, Bray Wyatt.
