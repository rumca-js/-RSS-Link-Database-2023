  <p id="xPnN9P">SpaceX <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/crew-7/">launched its Falcon 9 rocket</a> from Kennedy Space Center this morning at 3:27AM ET, NASA announced today. The rocket pushed four astronauts on NASA’s Crew-7 mission into orbit before a scheduled Sunday morning dock with the International Space Station (ISS).</p>
<p id="AWSBh7">The mission brings astronauts from four countries to the ISS — Jasmin Moghbeli of NASA, the European Space Agency’s Andreas Mogensen, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency astronaut Satoshi Furakawa, and Konstantin Borisov, a Russian cosmonaut. When the Dragon spacecraft — named Endurance — autonomously docks with the ISS, it will bring the station’s crew number up to 11 for a few days until board the capsule and return to Earth in a few days.</p>

The RNC cited a North Carolina State University study that found <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16743">Gmail was more likely</a> to mark emails from Republican campaigns as spam. One of the study’s authors <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/25/republicans-seized-study-proof-googles-bias-its-authors-say-it-being-misrepresented/">spoke to the <em>Post</em></a><em> </em>in May last year, saying its findings had been misrepresented.

  <p id="cgN5MA">As we enter the last week of August, it’s time to prepare for a jam-packed fall gadget season. Many companies, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23678497/apple-iphone-15-news-rumors-release-date-specs-features">including Apple</a>, will likely release new gadgets. Shopping events like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/8/23824247/amazon-prime-day-part-2-bigger-and-primer">Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Days</a> and Black Friday are set to take place, and of course, we can’t forget the holidays. Altogether, it amounts to a very busy season, particularly for the mail carriers who’ll be delivering all your purchases – and for the porch pirates, who’ll try to steal all of them. </p>

  <p id="qu29dX">A year ago at Berlin’s IFA tech trade show (think European CES), <em>Verge</em> reporter Jon Porter witnessed a Google Nest Hub control an Apple HomeKit smart plug. This “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/3/23334933/matter-eve-smart-home-demonstration-nest-hub-android-smartthings-alexa-echo">lightbulb moment for the smart home</a>” was the first public demonstration of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22832127/matter-smart-home-products-thread-wifi-explainer">Matter</a>. The new smart home standard is designed to fix the biggest issue facing tech in our homes: interoperability, and witnessing two fierce competitors in the space working together was exciting.
