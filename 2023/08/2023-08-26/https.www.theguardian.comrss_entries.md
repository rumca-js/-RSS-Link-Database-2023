<ul><li>Champion wins despite being felled by low blow in round five</li><li>Usyk down in distress for prolonged period before rallying</li></ul><p>Oleksandr Usyk retained his IBF, WBA and WBO world heavyweight titles when he stopped Daniel Dubois in the ninth round of an increasingly dramatic fight which changed course after the champion had been hurt by a borderline punch which was ruled a low blow. After dominating the fight with his superior skill Usyk was suddenly in real distress as he slumped to the canvas in round five after Dubois landed a heavy shot on the beltline.</p><p>Shaking his head and in obvious pain, the Ukrainian was allowed almost four minutes to recover. The referee might have considered it an illegal blow but he did not deduct a point from the 25-year-old British challenger, who then had his best spell of the fight. But Usyk dropped him twice to seal his victory in the early hours of Sunday morning in the Polish city of Wroclaw.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/26/oleksandr-usyk-knocks-out-daniel-dubois-in-ninth-round-to-retain-titles">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Steve Borthwick’s side played with the weight of the world on their shoulders in their first defeat at the hands of Fiji</p><p>We are running out of synonyms for crisis. Turmoil, disaster, catastrophe, disarray, calamity … put them all together and they barely do justice to England’s predicament. They had never failed to beat Fiji by less than double figures before this but as the clock ticked down in the final few minutes the Pacific Islanders could bask in the glory of their history-making feats. The blue Fijian flags fluttered in a sun-soaked corner of Twickenham, their supporters dancing with delight. England’s white flags had long since been waved.</p><p>Fijian pitch invaders were embraced by their teammates, England supporters – those who turned up – slinked out with their side at a new ebb. It is tempting to herald this as England’s most embarrassing defeat but that does scant justice to Fiji who have been knocking on the door of rugby union’s established elite and now smashed the door down.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/aug/26/shambolic-england-face-early-world-cup-exit-without-drastic-action">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Between seasons, it’s easy to reach for jeans. But why not give denim a new dimension? We pick 10 of the best looks</p><p>Much has been written on fashion pages about denim being the best thing for this in-between limbo season. While it’s a style cliché, like most clichés it’s also true. Reaching for a favourite pair of jeans as summer peters out is an easy way to head into autumn with minimal effort. Denim skirts are having a resurgence. See <strong>Reformation</strong>’s Tazz maxi style (£188) or <strong>M&amp;S</strong>’s midi (4, below), as with jeans, they work equally well with vests and flat sandals or jumpers and boots.</p><p>Denim jumpsuits are a super-useful wardrobe staple. Try <strong>Mango</strong>’s button-front, dark- blue version (£59.99) for a fitted silhouette or <strong>Whistles</strong>’ belted V-neck style (£159) for a looser fit. <strong>Jigsaw</strong>’s sleeveless collared top (£85) with matching wide-leg trousers (£110) has a cool Jackie Brown vibe when worn together. A classic denim shirt tucked into jeans styled with a trenchcoat and loafers is another timeless look.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/aug/26/moody-blues-take-a-dive-into-the-new-denim">Continue reading...</a>

<p>West Ham top of the Premier League, their dreadful record against Brighton reaching a spectacular end, and a victory that must be registered as a tactical triumph for David Moyes. Smash-and-grab, old-style pragmatism picked apart the new-wave counterpress that has made Roberto De Zerbi the name to drop among football intellectual circles.</p><p>“Are you watching Declan Rice?” asked the away fans, perhaps a tad ungratefully since James Ward-Prowse, bought with Rice’s transfer fee, had opened the scoring. Rice’s replacement in defensive midfield, Edson Álvarez, was another outstanding performer. Brighton dominated possession but had no answer to the quality of West Ham’s attack. Lucas Paquetá, who would have joined Rice in exiting the club had other matters not intervened, played creative director, and often off a minimal supply as Jarrod Bowen and Michail Antonio, the other scorers, showed a ruthlessness in attack that Brighton failed to emulate.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/26/brighton-west-ham-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## The Observer view on GCSE results: this widening gap will blight children’s lives | Observer editorial

The growing discrepancies in attainment could have been avoided if ministers had invested sufficient time, energy and money in education<p>August is always an anxious month for young people awaiting exam results. But this year brought an added stress: Ofqual, the exams regulator, had indicated that this year grade distributions would return to pre-pandemic standards, meaning pupils would be subject to tougher grade boundaries than a year ago. A-level and GCSE results are now in, and together they confirm what a growing body of evidence has already indicated: that the pandemic has resulted in significant amounts of learning loss, particularly for children and young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. And as Prof Sir Kevan Collins, the government’s former education recovery tsar, tells the <em>Observer</em> today, these results are the product of ministers failing to invest sufficiently in support for children to help them make up ground they lost during the lockdowns of 2020 and 2021.</p><p>The headline results are lower than last year, as expected: after A-level and GCSE results were unavoidably inflated as a result of moving to teacher-assessed grades in 2020 and 2021, Ofqual was always going to need to reverse towards the 2019 grade distribution; the question was simply how fast it would get there. Ofqual ultimately decided on a two-year pathway back, arguably the right decision in that it is better overall for young people, universities and employers to have maximum consistency in terms of what a certain grade means year to year; as a result, there will be three years of results that should be interpreted differently to what came before and after the pandemic, not four or five.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/26/observer-view-exam-results-impact-pandemic-young-people">Continue reading...</a>

TV viewers adore dating shows. But their appeal is more complicated than it seems at first sight<p>I’m partial to a television dating show but is it all getting out of hand? The routine proliferation of different formats is turning into a veritable infestation of the schedules. Soon, we won’t be able to move for pushy, pouting desperadoes trying to find love or the best camera-hogging “storyline” – whichever comes first and makes the heart beat faster. Beyond that, could it be true that the dating TV tsunami has a real-world effect on how ordinary British people romantically relate to each other?</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/love-island" title=""><em>Love Island</em></a> franchise has a well documented dark side: not least the suicides of people connected to the show (presenter Caroline Flack and contestants Sophie Gradon and Mike Thalassitis). Still, generally, dating TV appears to be experiencing a gold rush featuring myriad shows. <em>Love </em><em>Is Blind</em> (people bond unseen in pods). <em>The Ultimatum</em> (put bluntly: marry me or do one). <em>Married </em><em>at First Sight</em> (the clue is in the title). <em>Temptation Island</em> (couples are “tested”), <em>Naked Attraction</em> (starkers and ready for love), <em>Sexy Beasts</em> (icky flirting in bizarre masks), <em>The Love Trap</em> (evictees sent crashing through trap doors). And many more. This excludes formats I’ve decided are too lowbrow/depraved even for me – shows, usually with “hot” in the titles, that make you want to weep for the human race while simultaneously spooning out your own eyeballs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/26/love-island-tv-dating-shows-audience-more-sophisticated-than-you-think">Continue reading...</a>

The shameless Tory had too many strings to her bow to care much about Mid Bedfordshire<p>Before she was known as “Dosser Dorries”, the now former MP advertised her delight in relocating to “idyllic” Mid Bedfordshire, where she’d just been elected. People moved there, “as I have, because they wanted to wake up to the sound of birdsong rather than the incessant hum of traffic”. Vowing to “base everything I do on integrity”, she concluded <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo050525/debtext/50525-16.htm" title="">her maiden speech in 2005</a>: “I will always do my best for the people of Mid Bedfordshire, the place that I now call home.”</p><p>It was a strange thing for her to call Mid Bedfordshire, because Nadine Dorries really lived in Stratford-on-Avon. Even when, after two years, she finally submitted to the call of birdsong, she maintained another home in Stratford, or thereabouts, a <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmselect/cmstnprv/539/53918.htm" title="">complicated arrangement</a> which the parliamentary commissioner for standards took some time to unravel after questions were asked about which property was benefiting from parliamentary allowances. It did not help that she had pretended to live in Mid Bedfordshire when her main home was elsewhere. “It was unrealistic of Ms Dorries,” <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmselect/cmstnprv/539/53904.htm" title="">John Lyon concluded</a> in 2010, “to expect to keep secret the general location of her main home.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/26/nadine-dorries-vowed-to-do-best-for-constituents-in-resigning-she-has-succeeded">Continue reading...</a>

Dettori picked up a retirement presentation from the York executive, then rode a winner and performed the near-obligatory flying dismount after a parade in front of the stands to mark what he expected to be his last success on the Knavesmire – “because I’m drawn in 24 in the Ebor”.</p><p>Then he went out and won the Ebor, too, on Absurde, coming home in front from a wide draw for the second year running.

Farewell to London’s Le Gavroche, India Club, Banner’s and countless others that have hosted family celebrations down the decades<p>The great American journalist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jul/01/joseph-mitchell-up-in-old-hotel" title="">Joseph Mitchell</a> turned writing about the death of favourite restaurants into an artform. If the soul of his city, New York, existed anywhere, he argued, it was in the life of its waterfront and backstreet eating houses. In this spirit, in the 1940s and 1950s Mitchell created a new form of obituary: the long, heartfelt memorial to the passing of those places in which we gather to make memories or forget sorrows – most of them demolished in the name of development.</p><p>Mitchell would have had plenty to say about the imminent erasure of several much-loved London institutions. Michel Roux Jr’s decision to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/aug/19/michel-roux-jr-to-close-la-gavroche-restaurant-for-better-work-life-balance" title="">close Le Gavroche</a> brings to an end a family-inspired taste for authentic (and expensive) French cooking that began 56 years ago; the fabulous, eccentric <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/reveller/restaurants/the-india-club-historic-indian-restaurant-to-close-after-more-than-70-years-b1101902.html" title="">India Club</a> along the Strand, has had an even longer run – it has been seven decades since the first lamb bhuna was dished up on its determinedly democratic refectory tables (its freeholder wants to make it another luxury hotel). Great restaurants have personal memories built in. And in this sense, the loss I will feel most keenly will be that of <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/reveller/restaurants/banners-crouch-end-restaurant-closing-b1095349.html" title="">Banner’s</a>, the ultimate neighbourhood cafe in Crouch End, north of the city – which famously once entertained Bob Dylan – and which for 30 years has been the place where my family has celebrated birthdays and anniversaries.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/26/le-gavroche-favourite-restaurants-vanishing-insects-games-donald-trump-mugshot-tom-waits">Continue reading...</a>

He wanted to have a peaceful and timely transfer of power, so he repeatedly attempted to contact the town’s previous mayor, Haywood “Woody” Stokes III, but Stokes would not return his calls.</p><p>Braxton, who is Black, decided to go to the town hall and talk to Stokes, who is white, in person. He told Stokes that he would need a key to the town hall to begin his duties. Stokes acquiesced and gave him a key, but when Braxton entered the building, he found that town hall had been stripped of its records, beyond a couple boxes of discarded items that looked like trash. He also said he noticed that Stokes had given keys to friends of his, people who were not council members and had no official business with the city, who were walking in and out of the building.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/26/black-mayor-alabama-town-locked-out">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Edinburgh comedy award-winning show Ends is a superb set about Shah’s grandfather, the standup’s imminent wedding and multicultural Britain </p><p>The cliche about Edinburgh fringe comedy is that, instead of jokes, it’s all tears and dead loved ones. No one ever said that about the Edinburgh comedy award ceremony – but they could now, after an event on Saturday marked as much by high emotion as laughs. Ahir Shah’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/24/ahir-shah-ends-review-monkey-barrel-edinburgh">winning show, Ends</a>, is about his grandfather’s migration to the UK, the changing face of multicultural Britain, and the comic’s imminent wedding. Accepting the award – the most prestigious in live comedy – he was visibly moved, although that didn’t preclude a choice quip about this year’s Indian double whammy (with Mumbai-based Urooj Ashfaq winning the best newcomer prize). “Rishi,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/26/edinburgh-festival-fringe-ahir-shah-ends-comedy-awards-best-show">said the 32-year-old</a>, “is really delivering for the community!”</p><p>It was a deserving win for a cracking show, one that – almost as an aside – argues for Britain as the least racist country in the world. All the more remarkable that Shah arrived in Edinburgh with a work-in-progress (therefore not eligible for the award), its development delayed by the death in April of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/may/02/adam-brace-had-a-magic-touch-for-comedy-and-theatre-both-worlds-will-mourn-his-death">his director Adam Brace</a>.

## Scrapper review – fizzing, vital exploration of the father-daughter bond

<p>Charlotte Regan’s feature debut, about a resourceful 12-year-old living alone whose father re-enters her life, brims with energy, ideas and colour</p><p>Everything that 12-year-old Georgie (impressive newcomer Lola Campbell) knows about family, she learned from her single mother. And that includes the knack of filling the space left by an absent parent. While her mother was alive, she was both mum and dad to her daughter. Now that she has died, Georgie has taken on the responsibility of parenting herself. Resourcefully pulling the wool over the eyes of social services with an invented uncle as a guardian, Georgie continues to live alone in the home she shared with her mum. She has a best friend, Ali (Alin Uzun); an income (earned through bike theft); and an idiosyncratic, fiercely guarded process of grieving. There’s one thing she doesn’t need in her life: the arrival of her overgrown kid of a father, Jason (Harris Dickinson). Strangers, Georgie and Jason warily eye each other, unwitting mirror images with their clenched lips, hunched shoulders and punchy truculence.</p><p>The feature debut from 29-year-old Londoner Charlotte Regan, <em><a href="https://www.scrapper.film/">Scrapper</a></em> brims with sugar-fuelled youthful energy and an itchy, endless scroll of ideas. Taking a cue from Georgie’s co-dependent relationship with her phone, Regan employs jump cuts and a skittish camera (the film is deftly shot by Molly Manning Walker, whose own directorial debut, <em>How to Have Sex</em>, is out later this year). The colour palette – tangerine, mint green and milkshake pink – seems to have been inspired by a packet of Refreshers sweets. Video game speech bubbles pop up on screen from a Greek chorus of onlooking spiders. Not everything works: statements to camera from teachers, neighbours and social workers land heavily. But mostly Regan’s unfiltered approach brings a fizzing unpredictability and vitality to this abrasively empathic exploration of a father-daughter bond.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/26/scrapper-review-fizzing-vital-exploration-father-daughter-bond-charlotte-regan">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Royal Spanish Football Federation officials can stick their heads in the sand but that will not happen without consequence</p><p>When Héctor Bellerín wrote: “The narcissist never believes they have made a mistake, they are able to lie, manipulate the truth and make the victim guilty in order to retain their power,” he wasn’t writing a “how to retain power” escape manual for Luis Rubiales. Except, you could be forgiven for thinking that’s how it has been taken, on the basis of the tripling down by the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/26/spain-football-federation-threatens-to-sue-protesting-female-players">in support of its deluded president</a> in the form of an 808-word defence of Rubiales.</p><p>The extraordinary RFEF statement – which dropped late on Friday night and is headlined “Official Statement of the RFEF in response to Futpro”, the Spanish players’ union – genuinely reads like it is meant to be Rubiales’ “aha!

## Astrophysicist Avi Loeb: ‘UFOs should be the subject of mainstream inquiry. Science must bring clarity’

<p>The Harvard scientist on his search for alien technology, academic jealousy and why we must fund space exploration</p><p>Abraham Loeb, known as Avi, is a professor of astrophysics at Harvard University and he has done the unthinkable. He has repeatedly been willing to contemplate the existence of nonhuman technology and how it may explain certain perplexing astronomical observations that mainstream science struggles with. Loeb, 61, is the author of <em>Interstellar: The Search for Extraterrestrial Life and Our Future Beyond Earth</em>, a follow-up to his <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/extraterrestrial-9781529304848">Extraterrestrial: The First Sign of Intelligent Life Beyond Earth</a>.</em> On the day we spoke, the US government was preparing to hold a House of Representatives oversight and accountability <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jul/26/ufo-hearing-congress-david-grusch-whistleblower-live-updates">committee hearing</a> on UFOs with retired air force officer and former intelligence official David Grusch, who turned<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/06/whistleblower-ufo-alien-tech-spacecraft"> whistleblower</a> in June, claiming that the US government had retrieved pieces of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jun/17/aliens-ufo-uaps-us-defence-government-coverup-david-grusch">crashed</a> alien spacecraft.</p><p><strong>When it comes to UFOs, why is it always a government cover-up? Why don’t astronomers see UFOs – aren’t they the people looking at the sky the most?<br /></strong>The government would be a natural first to recognise anything unusual in the sky or in crash sites because their day job is to worry about national security and to monitor the nearby environment. Astronomers always train their telescopes on very distant, slow-moving objects. They are not looking for anything fast-moving or nearby. So it’s possible that if anything unusual happened, the US government would notice it first.</p><p><em>Interstellar: The Search for Extraterrestrial Life and Our Future Beyond Earth</em> by Avi Loeb is published by John Murray (£20).

<p>It may have become a lightning rod for parental anxiety but this very British festival is still the dream gig for 16-year-olds fresh from GCSE hell</p><p>Reading is not the most exotic location for an epiphany but they come where they come. It was 1991. The festival’s heavy metal years having ended in 1988 when Meat Loaf was struck in the face by an airborne bottle of urine, it was three years into its new indie-rock incarnation. I was 17 and mortifyingly insecure. Reading offered great bands – Sonic Youth, De La Soul, the Sisters of Mercy – and, more importantly, three glorious days and nights with two of my best friends and no parents. I got stoned for the first time (yes, I was assured, the stars did indeed look beautiful), put myself off vodka for life, had my trousers stolen (with all my money in them) while I was sleeping, lived off £1 garlic bread, and made countless new friends while sitting around campfires. In the car home on Monday morning, I felt like a different person, flushed with a social confidence I had never experienced before. Even through the scrim of a three-day hangover, life looked brighter.</p><p>This year, my daughter Hope is going for the first time, along with tens of thousands of other 16-year-olds. Her generation has acquired more rituals, from proms to commemorative leavers’ hoodies, and Reading, which neatly begins on the day the GCSE results come out, has become a consensus rite of passage, regardless of whether you care about live music. Many first-timers will never go again because it will have served its purpose as a milestone experience. Hope finds it easier to name the friends who are <em>not</em> going.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/26/kids-going-to-reading-dont-panic-its-a-rite-of-passage-for-uk-teenagers">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Usher Hall; The Queen’s Hall, Edinburgh<br /></strong>Klaus Mäkelä leads skilled versions of Sibelius and Mahler, while Yuja Wang brings warmth and Ravel and Andsnes and Chamayou tackle Schubert and Kurtág</p><p>High summer in Edinburgh: hard hat, hi-vis vest, steel toe-cap boots. Not a festival fashion tip, though it could be, but the essentials for a first glimpse of a hidden site in the city centre now being cleared for a 1,000 seat concert hall, the Scottish capital’s first dedicated new venue for music in a century. To add “state of the art” is redundant. Designed by David Chipperfield Architects (Turner Contemporary, Margate; the Hepworth, Wakefield, the Neues Museum, Berlin), with acoustics by Nagata, responsible for all the most enviable new concert halls (Philharmonie, Paris; Elbphilharmonie, Hamburg; Walt Disney Concert Hall, Los Angeles), the ingredients are world class.</p><p>This is Nagata’s first UK project. With so much gloom about music elsewhere in Britain – <a href="https://www.ism.org/news/paying-the-price">read the damning report from the ISM</a> (Independent Society of Musicians), published last week, on the impact of Brexit – it’s impossible not to be excited at the building’s ambition: a flexible, mid-sized hall to complement Edinburgh’s beloved Queen’s Hall and Usher Hall. Named after the charitable trust that is the main donor, the <a href="https://dunardcentre.co.uk/">Dunard Centre</a> will open in 2027. That same year, the long awaited National Centre for Music, scaled back from its original scheme but still with an emphasis on music education, choirs and orchestras in the locality, will open at the former Royal High School, the distinctive Greek revival building on Calton Hill.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/26/the-week-in-classical-oslo-philharmonicmakela-leif-ove-andsnes-and-bertrand-chamayou-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The author of Birdsong and Human Traces discusses his futuristic 16th novel, what it means to be human and what the future holds for our species</p><p><strong>Your new novel, The Seventh Son, begins with an experiment at an IVF clinic that stretches the bounds of scientific knowledge and ethics. What inspired you to address this subject</strong><strong>?</strong><br />It’s something that’s been kicking around in my mind since I wrote Human Traces, when I did a lot of research into genetics and evolution and the roots of mental illness. Then it was discovered in about 2010 that most people in the world have a degree of Neanderthal in our genome. I found it rather thrilling. And then about three years ago, I read a tweet by Richard Dawkins, imagining some kind of genetic engineering experiment. And I thought, maybe that could be the basis of a story.</p><p><strong>The Seventh Son explores what it means to be human, and what we are capable of as a species. Do you think we are now at a crucial point in history?</strong><br />The older you get, the more you read that we’re at “a time of unprecedented this or that”. Of course, there was always a precedent. But clearly there are very big scientific developments, including the discovery of new species of human ancestor. I’d hope that it makes people have a better understanding of the relatively insignificant part that modern humans have to play in the world, and the fact that we are just a very random endpoint of the human genus. It could so easily have been otherwise. The last remaining human species needn’t have been so extreme and so violent, and indeed so clever as we are. And I think it would be a good idea if we had a little more understanding of what a particularly freakish species we are and the responsibilities that come with that. The Neanderthals lasted about 300,000 years and I don’t think we’ll make that. We’ll destroy the world before then.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/26/sebastian-faulks-the-last-remaining-human-species-neednt-have-been-so-violent-and-clever-as-we-are">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Fed up with the white boys’ club of British standup, a one-way ticket to LA finally brought fame to the ‘comedy Beyoncé’. Now she has written a memoir detailing her rise from bullied teen to transatlantic hit</p><p>“Let me think,” says the comedian and actor London Hughes when asked what she misses about living in the UK. “I miss my friends and family. I miss pickled onion Monster Munch, and Malibu and pineapple in a can. I miss sea salt and chardonnay-flavoured crisps from the Co-op. Do I miss working in Britain? After the way I was treated?” She lets out a throaty laugh. “Not at all.”</p><p>It has been three and a half years since Hughes bit the bullet and moved to Los Angeles in search of opportunities denied to her back home. A fortnight after she arrived, Covid-19 sent the world into lockdown. “Yet I still managed to end that year with a new TV show and a comedy special,” Hughes says. “I made more money in that first year of moving to America than I’d made in my whole life in Britain. I’m, like: ‘England! What is wrong with you? How dare you make me feel like I wouldn’t make it when I had all this talent in me.’ To this day, I tell anyone who is not a white man who is trying to make it in comedy in Britain to leave.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/aug/26/london-hughes-comedian-interview-memoir-living-my-best-life-hun">Continue reading...</a>

Why the delay?</strong><br />When Nasa was first created, the requirements were that you had to be able to be a jet pilot, but you couldn’t get jet pilot experience without being in the military. Women were banned from flying jets in the military. Nasa was so hellbent on getting to the moon that being inclusive and letting women into the programme was seen as a distraction. It went all the way up to Lyndon B Johnson. There is a memo of his where he writes “Stop this now” on a document related to getting women into the space programme.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/26/loren-grush-on-nasas-first-female-astronauts-people-thought-theyd-be-a-distraction-to-the-men-in-space">Continue reading...</a>

<p>On the ISS, astronauts from Russia and the west share a craft the size of a large family home. So what happened when Moscow started a conflict 250 miles below on Earth? </p><p>One evening in January 2015, Terry Virts, a Nasa astronaut onboard the International Space Station (ISS), decided to pop over to the Russian quarters, catch up with his Russian colleagues and check out the view. For views, nothing beats the space station. From this orbiting perch approximately 250 miles (400km) above the Earth, scores of astronauts have waxed lyrical about the beauty of our planet: its mesmerising, fast-motion sunrises and sunsets, its brilliant colours and startling fragility.</p><p>As a 47-year-old former space shuttle pilot, then on his second visit to the space station, Virts had experienced all of this himself and would do so many times again. But this night would be different.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/aug/26/its-like-doing-an-arctic-expedition-with-german-scientists-in-1943-life-on-the-international-space-station-at-a-time-of-war">Continue reading...</a>

Pipirrana is a zingy tomato salad from Andalusia in my beloved southern Spain, where juicy tomatoes ripen early and have an incredible flavour. It will come as no surprise, then, that the secret to it is really good, ripe tomatoes. Now, in high summer, our own British tomatoes are also excellent, so go the extra mile to find the ripest and best-quality ones you can get your hands on.

Upon his return in 2013, now 19, he produced a stunning and deeply mature debut album, Doris. Gone were the sexual assault fantasies and instead Kgositsile employed his signature drawl on sludgy tracks that exposed his relationship with his absent father, his friendships and the frantic state of LA.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/26/earl-sweatshirt-review-rappers-return-is-a-reminder-of-his-early-brilliance">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After 17 years abroad, Zadie Smith has returned to her literary stomping ground of north London. She talks about fame, therapy and finding inspiration for her new historical novel on her doorstep</p><p>After 17 years abroad, Zadie Smith is back. She has returned to Kilburn in north-west London, where she grew up and which she has made her fictional territory since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/jan/26/fiction.zadiesmith">White Teeth</a> turned her into a star in 2000. Her fourth novel was called, simply, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/31/nw-zadie-smith-review">NW</a>. Even those novels that aren’t set here – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/sep/10/fiction.zadiesmith">On Beauty</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/13/swing-time-zadie-smith-review">Swing Time</a> – touch down for a visit. Many of her characters escape only to come back eventually, just as she did, leaving New York during the pandemic with her husband, the Northern Irish poet Nick Laird, and their two children. “If you stay away too long, you just miss too much,” she says.</p><p>We meet in the William IV pub on the Harrow Road. Smith arrives on her bike in a black T-shirt and jeans, weighed down by a London Review of Books tote straining with books and her laptop. She is post-school run. (Her brother Ben – the comedian and rapper <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/mar/04/poetry.popandrock">Doc Brown</a> – and his family live close by, and his wife teaches at the school Zadie and her brothers went to as a children. “So it’s all very familiar,” she says now.) The pub has been chosen for its relevance to Smith’s new novel, The Fraud, which is once again set around Kilburn. But instead of the exhaust fumes, kebab joints and market stalls of her earlier novels, The Fraud looks back to a time when this area was just fields and manor houses. With its social injustice, inheritances, trials and reversals of fortune, the novel combines the world of Dickens (who has his own cameo appearances) with the verve of Hilary Mantel’s historical fiction. It is also extraordinarily timely. As Smith herself says: “It’s a corker.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/26/zadie-smith-i-get-in-trouble-when-i-talk-about-the-state-of-the-nation">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The 24-year-old went into Wimbledon with no expectations but she arrives at the US Open as a grand slam champion and must learn how to win with the pressure on</p><p>In the early days of the grass season this June, Marketa Vondrousova and her doubles partner for the week, her Czech compatriot Katerina Siniakova, navigated their way to the final in Berlin. At that point, Vondrousova’s record in finals, across singles and doubles alike, was not exactly ideal. Their eventual three-set defeat marked her seventh straight loss when it matters most. In the aftermath, not even her mother, Jindriska, could hide her frustration.</p><p>“They came for the finals and she said, like: ‘I don’t want to be second all the time,’” says Vondrousova, laughing, as she recalls the conversation with her mother. “I was like: ‘OK, it’s good even to be in a final. Come on, Mum!’ And she’s like: ‘Yeah, but I don’t want to be second all the time.’”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/26/marketa-vondrousova-us-open-tennis">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The watchable London fighter has little more than a puncher’s chance on Saturday but at least this contest feels authentic</p><p>For all the many gifts of Daniel Dubois, a world heavyweight contender this weekend, and a hugely likable pure sporting talent, it is hard not to find yourself circling back to the press-ups. As first trailed in a fascinating 2019 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/mar/04/daniel-dubois-boxing-anthony-joshua-donald-mcrae-interview" title="">interview with Donald McRae</a> in these pages, the teenage Dubois would regularly settle down and do between three and five hours of press-ups.</p><p>Really: five. No water, no food, just press-ups. It seems useful to put that in a real-world context. If, for example, Dubois were to start doing press-ups in your living room as you left for a half day at school – bus ride, registration, lessons, morning break, sandwich lunch – he would still be there doing press-ups as you opened the front door again.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/26/daniel-dubois-oleksandr-usyk-heavyweight-boxing-poland">Continue reading...</a>

At least, not until this super-charged Twickenham evening, as fierce a Rugby World Cup warm-up as you will see despite the one-sided scoreboard.</p><p>In a match where the devastating power of the Springbok pack was again to the fore – when Jacques Nienaber selected a seven-one split in favour of forwards on the replacements’ bench – it may seem odd to focus on a back. But intelligently applied South African power is a given these days, and the 20-year-old Moodie clearly has something special.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/aug/25/rugby-union-south-africa-new-zealand-canan-moodie">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Tins and the frozen food aisle make this feast a thrifty triumph: spicy mussels with coriander seeds, jackfruit and green bean pulao, and a make-ahead mango brulee</p><p>Bank holiday weekends are a great time to have buddies over for a meal. Sunday night feels like Saturday night, and Monday often feels like a free day. What isn’t free, of course, is the meal itself, but there are lots of ways to keep down costs while still feasting. The freezer aisle is a great place to start – those packets of frozen cooked fish and frozen vegetables will go a long way – before heading for the shelves stacked with tins. Tinned tropical fruit works particularly well, with its intense sweetness ready and waiting to be used in all sorts of ways.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/aug/26/spicy-mussels-jackfruit-green-bean-pulao-mango-brulee-bank-holiday-meal-recipes-yotam-ottolenghi">Continue reading...</a>

With the US standing on a political precipice, suddenly the stakes were a lot higher</p><p>In my defence, it was never my intent to write about it. I did not have time. No one asked me to. And several people strongly cautioned against it. Not now – not with the literal and figurative fires roiling our planet. And certainly not about this.</p><p>Other Naomi – that is how I refer to her now. This person with whom I have been chronically confused for over a decade. My big-haired doppelganger.

The aim of the five-hour meeting was to help reset Ukraine’s military strategy – top of the agenda was what to do about the halting progress of Ukraine’s counteroffensive, along with battle plans for the gruelling winter ahead plus longer-term strategy as the war inevitably grinds into 2024.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/26/how-uk-military-chief-became-key-nato-liaison-in-ukraine-tony-radakin">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Rightwing justices claim to rule in the Founders’ image. In reality, they disregard 250 years of constitutional law, simply to punish fellow Americans who do not share their values</p><p>The extreme religious right’s mission to roll back civil rights from abortion to public accommodations is being fueled by false facts and false history. Recent <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/174440/real-wedding-website-fake-gay-wedding-website-case">articles</a> in the New Republic have <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/173987/mysterious-case-fake-gay-marriage-website-real-straight-man-supreme-court">documented</a> the shaky factual foundation behind 303 Creative LLC v Elenis<em>,</em> the case in which the supreme court held that a website design business owned by an evangelical Christian, Lorie Smith, could refuse service to same-sex couples. Even more troubling, the history undergirding the majority’s reasoning is misleading and dangerous to the separation of church and state.</p><p>Tragically, the religious right knows it has a friendly audience in the six conservative Catholic justices on the supreme court, who have been partners in shaking the foundations of fundamental rights. The justices’ new standard is whether a constitutional right is grounded in “history and tradition”, the latest byword for the bogus doctrine of “originalism”. So they need some history, and apparently any history will do.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/aug/26/warped-history-us-supreme-court-lgbtq-rights-303-creative-obergefell">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Abernethy Forest, Cairngorms:</strong> The pinewoods are vulnerable, but the fire was caught early and contained</p><p>The blaeberries are out in the pinewoods, and we’re eating them as we walk when we realise we’re close to an area of the forest where there was a fire at the end of May. We’re in a WhatsApp group set up to keep an eye out for such things. Neighbours will post when they’re burning garden waste so we know not to worry. Someone messaged asking whether anyone knew what the smoke was in an out-of-the-way part of the forest. A sortie to check it out and a rapid response caught the fire early enough for it to be contained.</p><p>When we get to where the fire was, we’re shocked. Some smaller trees and junipers have been burned to a crisp and the thick bark of granny pines is scorched. The understory, previously thick with heather and blaeberry, is burned flat. Needles are rust-coloured, dead. Cones and flakes of bark lie in black and unnatural browns, though crisp bright leaves of new-growth blaeberries are already starting to push through. In a boggier area, drier, standing deadwood, so important to the ecosystem, has taken a terrible hit: whole snags are burned black, some have had to be felled. The grass nearby is an improbably bright green. It’s hard to believe that what we see is new growth since the fire.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/26/country-diary-shocking-damage-caused-by-fire-in-the-forest">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From the Canaries to Norway via Brittany and Scotland, these coastal havens offer safer sea swimming without the swell of waves</p><p>Whether they are naturally formed, cast in concrete on a rock shelf or hewn from the rock itself, tidal pools solve a problem by providing safe access to the sea. Plunging into rich saltwater in a sheltered area protected from the turbulent waves, yet still refreshed by the tide twice a day, is an unfettered joy.</p><p>The idea of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/swimming" title="">sea bathing</a> for health benefits became popular in the mid-18th century, and sea pools were a way to offer easy access. Beyond this, tidal pools became important as social infrastructure: they serve as vital community spaces, like village greens, town halls and other places we meet and socialise. After having being left to the elements for years, in recent times many tidal pools are being bolstered by communities looking to restore, protect and manage them. These include the dramatic Saltcoats Bathing Pond in North Ayrshire.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/aug/26/10-of-the-best-seawater-swimming-pools-in-the-uk-and-europe">Continue reading...</a>

Well, you get the same programme twice, actually: Crazy Rich Agents, which is BBC Two’s latest one, and Selling Super Houses, which is Channel 4’s.</p><p>Is it interesting or strange that two of the UK’s leading channels have essentially made the same show in different flavours (roughly: eight people compete in a series of half-challenges to prove they are the best high-end estate agent going; the last one standing gets a job)? The answer is: both. I needn’t tell you what’s going on with housing in this country – how’s your mortgage? Or worse, your rent? Well yeah, exactly – and the sheer real-lifeness of UK housing right now demands one of two TV reactions. Programmes either make hard-hitting demands for rent/interest-rate controls via gritty heart-changing documentaries that loudly whistle-blow about the corrupted future that looms if nothing is done. Or – and hear me out! Hear me out! – we all get to look at nice houses we can’t afford instead.

The beauty entrepreneur talks about addiction, breakups and the hell of pitching to finance bros in your 50s</p><p>Trinny Woodall is wearing all white – white suit, white waistcoat, white mesh platforms – and not just any old white, but <em>white-</em>white, as she calls it in her Instagram chats, the brightest, bleachiest white on the spectrum. She is scoffing a flaky croissant, which arrived with a square of soft yellow butter and a huge dollop of red-red jam. (“Thank you, Jonathan,” to the assistant; to me, “You sure you won’t have a bit?”) I watch as she alternates croissant and sloping bowl of coffee to her lips, unfazed by the danger to her suit. She’s talking in galloping vowels about a crash she had days earlier, a three-car collision on the corner of the street where she stayed in LA. Bruising makes it hard to sit for too long. She shifts her bottom, then heaves herself to stand and now is stamping round the cafe like a stabled thoroughbred. “My body is out of sync,” she says, “my knee and my ankle. I am bruised everywhere.”</p><p>On her left wrist is a white wound dressing of the hospital sort, but she flaps off my concern. There’s a lot of old school don’t-make-a-fuss about Woodall, who is 59. She says “darling” a lot, and “fuck”. Of the accident, I am imagining concertina-bonnets and wailing sirens; Woodall emerging through engine smoke in something from Zara, a neon suit, perhaps, or Alaïa (high street or high end: mid-range is “a waste of money”), keen to keep to the schedule because this trip to LA was after all mostly business. Beside her daughter Lyla, 19, work is Woodall’s primary and unrelenting preoccupation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/aug/26/trinny-woodall-i-didnt-stop-caring-when-i-turned-50-i-stopped-worrying">Continue reading...</a>

Any protein left over from the night before – roast pork or chicken, say, or leftover vegetables – can be used up in this fabulous dish.” Wherever possible, I like to make food with local, seasonal fresh vegetables and fruit, and pair them with various imported dried and preserved ingredients to create a unique fusion of flavours.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/aug/26/turn-leftover-roast-chicken-or-vegetables-into-pad-thai-recipe-zero-waste-cooking">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Lukashenko says Prigozhin dismissed warnings about threats to his life; Kremlin denies being behind plane crash; flight recorders and 10 bodies recovered</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">See all our Ukraine war coverage</a></li></ul><p><strong>The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, has said he warned the Wagner group </strong><strong>chiefs</strong><strong> Yevgeny Prigozhin and Dmitry Utkin</strong> – who apparently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/24/what-we-know-about-yevgeny-prigozhin-last-flight-a-visual-guide">died in a plane crash</a> on Wednesday – to watch out for possible threats to their lives, and insisted that Wagner fighters remain in Belarus. Lukashenko said on Friday that Prigozhin had twice dismissed his concerns about the possible threats. He said that during Prigozhin’s June mutiny he had warned he would “die” if he continued to march on Moscow, to which he said Prigozhin answered: “To hell with it – I will die.”</p><p><strong>The Kremlin said western suggestions that Prigozhin had been killed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/25/highly-likely-yevgeny-prigozhin-is-dead-says-uk-defence-ministry">on its orders were an “absolute lie”</a></strong>. It declined on Friday to definitively confirm his death, citing the need to wait for test results.</p><p><strong>A second plane linked to Prigozhin by some Russian media has no connection to Wagner group</strong> and never did, the CEO of the aircraft operator company said. Russian media, mainly associated with a Wagner Telegram channel, had linked a second business jet with the mercenary group and reported it was also in the air at the time of the crash.</p><p><strong>Russian investigators said they had recovered flight recorders and 10 bodies</strong> from the crash scene in Russia’s Tver region. “Molecular genetic analyses are being carried out to establish their identities,” Russia’s Investigative Committee said on social media on Friday.</p><p><strong>The UK’s defence ministry has said there is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/24/is-yevgeny-prigozhin-really-dead-not-everyone-is-convinced">not yet definitive proof </a>that Prigozhin was onboard the plane that crashed</strong> with no survivors but that it was “highly likely” he was dead.</p><p><strong>Russia’s paramilitary group Wagner is a spent force</strong>, Ukraine’s defence minister has said after Prigozhin’s presumed death. “There is actually no longer a Wagner group left as they were a year ago, as a serious fighting force,” Oleksii Reznikov told German newspaper Welt am Sonntag on Friday. “They are broken.”</p><p><strong>The US will begin flight <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/25/us-train-ukrainian-pilots-f-16-fighter-jets-ukraine-russia-war">training for Ukrainian pilots on F-16 fighter jets</a> in October</strong>, the Pentagon has announced. The training would begin after the pilots receive English-language training next month, a spokesperson said on Thursday. Several pilots and dozens of aircraft maintenance crew would take the training at an airbase in Arizona, he added.</p><p><strong>Turkey sees “no alternative” to the original grain export agreement Ukraine struck with Russia</strong>, Ankara has said, dismissing an alternate route reportedly being considered by the US. Russia last month <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/20/what-was-the-black-sea-grain-deal-and-why-did-it-collapse">pulled out of the deal</a> that enabled Ukraine to export grain from three Black Sea ports but Ukraine this month <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/17/cargo-ship-leaves-ukraine-port-of-odesa-black-sea">sent a cargo vessel to Istanbul</a> to test the alternate route.
