<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-booed-onlookers-speaking-press-lake-tahoe-california" target="_blank">Fox News reports</a> the Bidens are renting the $18 million home of billionaire <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/irs-going-for-middle-class" target="_blank">Tom Steyer</a>. But let's not sleep on the lede. He was booed as he was leaving a PILATES class, which he took after taking a SPIN class with his wife. We here at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website are all about fitness. But the visuals of Biden doing pilates are hilarious. We think it would look something like this.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>As I keep saying. There are people working in the White House who don't respect this man and/or are working for Gavin Newsom. Either that, or they think all of these things make Biden look engaging and endearing, and every member of his campaign staff needs to be blacklisted from politics.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## A "rich man" north of Richmond claps back at Oliver Anthony in new video, as Anthony blasts conservative fans

<p>LOL, of course, this is our friend Remy and what we in the content industry call a "parody."

<p>I know that we're all expected to have the exact opposite opinion than we had before Anthony released this video. Not here and not me. Still love the music and I live in a world where reasonable people can disagree on things. If I ever had a conversation with the singer I'd be less concerned about who he voted for as much as what he thinks of the new Zach Bryan and Turnpike Troubador albums. </p><p>I would like to make three points though:</p><p>1. In my write-up of <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-2024-gop-debate" target="_blank">that moment from the debate</a>, I called it a hack move by Fox News. It was such a telegraphed hack move, that I suggested a drinking game rule about it.</p><p>2. Anthony has a point. Many in conservative media are in fact aggravating. However, it's worth pointing out we are not the ones actively trying to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/rolling-stone-blasts-rich-men-north-of-richmond" target="_blank">delegitimize his success</a> or <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/gma-highlights-divisiveness-racial-dog-220240740.html" target="_blank">call him racist</a>.</p><p>3. Every election, the country is broken down to 40% on the Right, 40% leftists, and 20% in the middle who go either way depending on the mood every four years. They are the apolitical, a pox on both their houses segment of the country that found such an emotional connection with Anthony he's got the #1 song in America. I don't apologize for "politicizing" that by asking what my side is doing to appeal to that 20% when I don't always feel we have much of a plan.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Bodycam footage may FINALLY reveal identity of that motherf*cker who is not real: "What is assault mean?"

<p>The one thing missing... who was the not real motherf*cker? The story is that she <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/not-real-airplane-lady-identified" target="_blank">got into a fight with her family over AirPods</a>. That's an odd thing to yell at your cousin who, presumably, you would know is real. All those cameras on the flight, and no one thought to zoom in on who she was screaming at... until now!</p><p>An eagle-eyed TikTokker reviewed the bodycam footage.

<p>"What is assault mean?"</p><p>According to this alleged person's story, he was sitting next to Tiffany on the plane. Her being on the phone might explain the family part of it. They weren't ON the plane and were who she was screaming at on the phone. Then, and this me doing my best Sherlock impersonation, lost her AirPods and started to have a nutty. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>I'm just sayin'... if I were a demon, shapeshifter, ghost, or lizard person and I wanted to blend in inconspicuously, this is the form I would take. Buttondown and khakis. Immigrant with somewhat broken English acting like he doesn't fully understand the police officer. And notice how quick he was to get back on the plane: "Okay, now I'll board my flight."</p><p>Tiffany Gomas KNEW something, and her meltdown foiled the not-real motherf*cker's plan. She knew if the plane took off, it wasn't going to reach its destination. And I quote: "<em>And you can sit on this plane and you can f*cking die with them or not."</em></p><p>The demon/shapeshifter/ghost/lizard person's plan was foiled. His cover was blown. Because Gomas was willing to take one for the team and go viral looking like a crazy person, she saved an entire flight full of people.</p><p>People need to be thanking Tiffany for her heroism. They are alive because of her.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
