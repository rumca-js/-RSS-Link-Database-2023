<p>The sprint champion with three golds in Budapest believes more professional marketing could raise the sport’s profile</p><p>Noah Lyles is one of the most compelling figures in sport right now, and don’t the suits at Netflix know it. Their cameras and boom mics have followed the US sprinter around like an eager puppy at these World Athletics Championships, watching his prophecies become realities and capturing every moment of Lyles’ extraordinary three gold medals in Budapest.</p><p>The closest thing to Usain Bolt’s successor? Most people in track and field would say so. And next year, when Netflix’s new show is broadcast before the Paris Olympics, the rest of the world will believe so too. “They weren’t talking about me at the beginning,” Lyles jokes, when asked about the streaming service’s intense interest in him. “But as soon as I won in Paris in June they got buddy-buddy with me really quick.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/26/no-more-amateur-stuff-noah-lyles-on-mission-to-transform-athletics">Continue reading...</a>

## The Blind Boys of Alabama: Echoes of the South review – rich and moving gospel set

<p>(Single Lock)<br />After 80 years, the troupe’s latest line-up offer traditional songs of struggle and religion leavened with covers of soul giants<br /></p><p>The gospel troupe’s latest album is named after the radio show that first booked them, way back in 1944. The Boys, from the Alabama Institute for the Negro Deaf and Blind, modelled themselves on black groups such as the Golden Gate Quartet, but under the south’s Jim Crow laws they were bizarrely allowed to sing only white gospel. From this modest beginning the group’s <a href="http://www.blindboys.com/">ever changing roster </a>has come to embody gospel and its spirit of perseverance and sanctity for a global audience, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/21/blind-boys-of-alabama-jimmy-carter-segregation-black-president-interview">helped by star-laden collaborations</a> and inspired cover versions (Waits, Dylan, Stones). Here the focus is on tradition; the whooping, frenetic Send It On Down and Nothing But Love, the testimony of You Can’t Hurry God. The voices – rich and grained, with the occasional surprising falsetto – are backed by a minimalist four-piece that adds a 1940s swing to Work Until My Days Are Done. There’s a moving, ruminative cover of Friendship, made famous by Pops Staples, while Curtis Mayfield’s Keep On Pushin’, a piece of c ivil rights optimism, is here slowed to stubborn resistance; such are the times. That two members of the group have died since recording adds poignancy to The Last Time (We’ll Sing Together), but the Boys endure.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/26/the-blind-boys-of-alabama-echoes-of-the-south-review-rich-and-moving-gospel-set">Continue reading...</a>

## The Wren, The Wren by Anne Enright review – the female gaze

<p>A ferocious sendup of a self-satisfied Irish poet and a brilliantly honest portrait of the women he leaves behind</p><p>Anne Enright is one of our acutest chroniclers of relational complexity, whether she’s skewering filial pieties in The Wig My Father Wore (1995), staging a tragicomedy of intergenerational fallout in the Booker-winning <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/apr/28/featuresreviews.guardianreview17">The Gathering</a> (2007), or unpicking the cliche of motherhood in her essay collection Making Babies (2004).</p><p>In her eighth novel, Enright again gives us a portrait of a uniquely unhappy family. Intimate and ambiguous, refusing to settle anywhere for long, The Wren, The Wren is told in three voices. There’s middle-aged Carmel, recalling her childhood on the outskirts of Dublin with her ailing mother, resentful older sister and womanising father. There’s Carmel’s free-spirited daughter Nell, who is trying to escape the intensity of their bond but only succeeds in swapping it for a far riskier one with an abusive lover; and finally, there is Carmel’s father himself, the poet Phil McDaragh, garrulous, seductive, pathologically self-regarding; the fount and origin of most of this dysfunction.</p><p><em>So Carmel reached into the bowl and threw one after another orange at Nell’s legs, and that seemed to work, after which they were gone and Carmel threw the empty bowl which bounced off Nell’s back and hit the floor, smashing there, so that Nell was stepping and dancing in the shards, which certainly did not bother her mother, who had been through a lot worse, a hell of a lot worse, than a stupid broken bowl.</em></p><p><em>“You think that’s bad?” she said. “You think that’s bad?”</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/26/the-wren-the-wren-by-anne-enright-review-the-female-gaze">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Writing about the acclaimed author, <strong>Catharine Lumby</strong> got to pore over his letters, receipts, even his sex life. Not everything she found made it in</p><p>I first met Frank Moorhouse in the early 1990s when I was living in New York. We were in Washington to speak at an event I remember as being improbably titled the Festival of Australian Ideas (oddly, no one mentioned the Hills Hoist or the Esky). We hit it off over dinner. The fact that I told him I fell in love with his writing as a teenager may have affected his judgment.</p><p>I grew up in the working-class beachside town of Newcastle with left-leaning liberal minded parents. His early books were on our shelves, and I read them. The author will be forever best-known for his wonderful protagonist Edith Campbell Berry, of the Edith trilogy, but his earlier short stories gave me a glimpse of a different world: an exciting bohemia in the Sydney suburb of Balmain where actors, journalists, writers, artists and film-makers all knew each other, socialised and fought for social justice. I remember telling a bemused 15-year-old friend that when I grew up I wanted to be Frank Moorhouse.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/26/frank-moorhouse-a-life-by-catharine-lumby-book">Continue reading...</a>
