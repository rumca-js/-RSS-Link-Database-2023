At the 45Drives Creators Summit, we got to take a peek inside the storage lab, where they build, test, and repair Storinators, Stornados, Destroyinators, and even prototype things like the cute little Storinator Jr!

45Drives paid for my flight to Sydney, NS, CA, but did not offer any other form of compensation or sponsorship for this video. I just really like their philosophy on storage, and wanted to talk to them about ideas like the Storinator Jr and the Homelab-focused servers of the future!
