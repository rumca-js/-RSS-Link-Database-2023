Escape From Tarkov: Arena is building a more accessible experience for those who want the excitement and intensity of Tarkov's combat, without the survival, exploration and looting gameplay.

At Gamescom 2023 we got to play a few rounds of Escape From Tarkov: Arena's Shootout and Teamfight game modes. Shootout takes inspiration from Call of Duty's Gulag, allowing players to spectate the rounds of intense 2v2 combat, while Teamfight pits 5 against 5 in a one life each team deathmatch. But how does Arena fit in next to Escape From Tarkov?
