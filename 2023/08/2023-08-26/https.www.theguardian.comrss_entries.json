But this year brought an added stress: Ofqual, the exams regulator, had indicated that this year grade distributions would return to pre-pandemic standards, meaning pupils would be subject to tougher grade boundaries than a year ago. A-level and GCSE results are now in, and together they confirm what a growing body of evidence has already indicated: that the pandemic has resulted in significant amounts of learning loss, particularly for children and young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. And as Prof Sir Kevan Collins, the government\u2019s former education recovery tsar, tells the <em>Observer</em> today, these results are the product of ministers failing to invest sufficiently in support for children to help them make up ground they lost during the lockdowns of 2020 and 2021.</p><p>The headline results are lower than last year, as expected: after A-level and GCSE results were unavoidably inflated as a result of moving to teacher-assessed grades in 2020 and 2021, Ofqual was always going to need to reverse towards the 2019 grade distribution; the question was simply how fast it would get there. Ofqual ultimately decided on a two-year pathway back, arguably the right decision in that it is better overall for young people, universities and employers to have maximum consistency in terms of what a certain grade means year to year; as a result, there will be three years of results that should be interpreted differently to what came before and after the pandemic, not four or five.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/26/observer-view-exam-results-impact-pandemic-young-people\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/26/observer-view-exam-results-impact-pandemic-young-people", "date_published": "2023-08-26T18:34:19.735503+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": "The Guardian", "album": "The Guardian", "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "You\u2019d have to cut off my electricity to stop me tuning in to an \u2018older Love Island\u2019 | Barbara Ellen", "description": "TV viewers adore dating shows.

Do you think we are now at a crucial point in history?</strong><br />The older you get, the more you read that we\u2019re at \u201ca time of unprecedented this or that\u201d. Of course, there was always a precedent. But clearly there are very big scientific developments, including the discovery of new species of human ancestor. I\u2019d hope that it makes people have a better understanding of the relatively insignificant part that modern humans have to play in the world, and the fact that we are just a very random endpoint of the human genus. It could so easily have been otherwise. The last remaining human species needn\u2019t have been so extreme and so violent, and indeed so clever as we are. And I think it would be a good idea if we had a little more understanding of what a particularly freakish species we are and the responsibilities that come with that. The Neanderthals lasted about 300,000 years and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll make that. We\u2019ll destroy the world before then.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/26/sebastian-faulks-the-last-remaining-human-species-neednt-have-been-so-violent-and-clever-as-we-are\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/26/sebastian-faulks-the-last-remaining-human-species-neednt-have-been-so-violent-and-clever-as-we-are", "date_published": "2023-08-26T12:04:09.543147+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": "The Guardian", "album": "The Guardian", "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Comedian London Hughes: \u2018I made more money in one year in America than my whole life in Britain\u2019", "description": "<p>Fed up with the white boys\u2019 club of British standup, a one-way ticket to LA finally brought fame to the \u2018comedy Beyonc\u00e9\u2019.

Pipirrana is a zingy tomato salad from Andalusia in my beloved southern Spain, where juicy tomatoes ripen early and have an incredible flavour. It will come as no surprise, then, that the secret to it is really good, ripe tomatoes. Now, in high summer, our own British tomatoes are also excellent, so go the extra mile to find the ripest and best-quality ones you can get your hands on. That way, you\u2019ll get all the flavours of gazpacho in salad form.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/aug/26/lemon-oregano-lamb-chops-pipirrana-tomato-salad-recipe-jose-pizarro\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/aug/26/lemon-oregano-lamb-chops-pipirrana-tomato-salad-recipe-jose-pizarro", "date_published": "2023-08-26T09:54:07.739932+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": "The Guardian", "album": "The Guardian", "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Before Prigozhin\u2019s death, Wagner was fighting on Russia\u2019s behalf in Africa.
