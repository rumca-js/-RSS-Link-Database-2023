I mean encourage citizens to switch to electric vehicles, citizens continue to discover electric vehicles su-diddly-uck. They can do some things. They are excellent for taking <em>15-minute</em> trips around your <em>city</em> (<a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/15-minute-city-chicken-coop\" target=\"_blank\">wink wink</a>). But performing basic truck functions or allowing you to take your family on a road trip, not so much. A Canadian family found this out the hard way when they abandoned their electric truck in Minnesota and rented won that ran on the sweet smell of gasoline.</p><p>Dalbir Bala called the event a \"<a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/electric-vehicle-trip-charging-infrastructure-1.6932074\" target=\"_blank\">nightmare frustration</a>.\" He wanted to switch to clean energy and lower food costs. So he bought a Ford F-150 Lightning Lariat for $115,000 and spend $16,000 to install chargers at his home and work. No be fair though, this is in Canadian money. In normal American money, he only spent $85,500 and $11,900.</p><p>Then he attempted to take his family on a road trip to Chicago. He mapped out three stops to recharge. The second stop in Minnesota was when \"we decided we don't want any more distraction or any frustration.\" The chargers didn't work and they could find anyone to help them or tell them why the chargers didn't work.</p><p>So they rented a gas guzzler to finish his trip.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"></div><p>It is an all too common occurrence. Drivers are suffering \"<a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/electric-car-road-trip\" target=\"_blank\">range anxiety</a>\" from having to recharge their EV twelve times to make a trip. Or by needing <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/electric-vehicle-colordo-wyoming\" target=\"_blank\">fifteen hours to go 178 miles</a>. My gas-powered Nissan? Three and a half hours. Four if I decide to have lunch at a rest stop.</p><p>Last year, a reporter attempted a road trip in order to sing. the praises and virtues of going green. Instead? \"<a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/family-ditches-electric-truck\" target=\"_blank\">Fumes never smelled so sweet</a>.\"</p><p>Ford's electric trucks appear to be the worst of the bunch. YouTuber Hoovies Garage reviewed one and called it a \"<a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ford-electric-truck-total-disaster\" target=\"_blank\">complete and total disaster</a>\" that couldn't do basic truck things. Again, if you are looking for a truck just so you can drive around your neighborhood looking cool and saying \"look at me, I have a truck\" and <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ford-electric-trucks-price-increase\" target=\"_self\">use your $7500 American tax credit to buy a car that's suddenly $8500 more expensive</a>, and electric truck could be the one for you.</p><p>Or you can buy a gas-powered car while we are still allowed and get to your destination. The choice is yours.

Dana White was in the news yesterday <a href=\"https://www.theblaze.com/news/dana-white-zuck-elon-colosseum\" target=\"_blank\">after appearing on Mike Tyson's podcast</a> and said HE spoke to Italy's Minister of Culture about hosting the fight at the Colosseum. Whether Elon specifying the UFC was NOT managing the fight the day after Dana was saying he was working on it is anyone's guess. With a lot of Elon's tweets, we find ourselves trying to wonder what Musk means when he uses words like \"and,\" \"the,\" and \"is.\"</p><p>Apropos of nothing, shout out to <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mike-tyson-kimmel-high\" target=\"_blank\">weed entrepreneur Mike Tyson</a> naming his podcast \"Hotboxing.\"</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RicFlairNatrBoy/status/1570034981656748032\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The good news is there was concern Musk might need back surgery. An MRI came back that he did not. Though he does need \"minor\" surgery on his shoulder.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1689969006910861312\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Elon Musk vs. Mark Zuckerberg... sometime in 2024? Your guess is as good as mine. Dana White predicts the fight can bring in a billion dollars worth of revenue and that would be <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/gold-star-mom-rips-biden\" target=\"_blank\">a nice nut to go to veterans</a>. Critics say that buying the fight would be the biggest waste of money... that they of course are going to do anyway. If MugClub doesn't fo a fight companion, I'll let my neighbor buy it like I did for the Conor McGregor vs Floyd Mayweather fight.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

The app isn't all sh*tposting, trolling, and spreading lies about the presidential candidate you don't like. Occasionally, you find someone like <a href=\"https://www.whiskeyriff.com/2023/08/10/virginia-native-oliver-anthony-makes-powerful-debut-rich-men-north-of-richmond/\" target=\"_blank\">Virginia native Oliver Anthony</a>. His powerful \"Rich Men North of Richmond\" has so enamored the Normie-American part of X, no doubt corporate journalismers have been dispatched to find a mean thing he wrote as a Facebook comment ten years ago. Or worse... a meme he liked.<br /></p><p>He was first discovered by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqSA-SY5Hro\" target=\"_blank\">\"radiowv\" on YouTube</a>, who said of Anthony, \"When I first came across Oliver Anthony and his music, I was blown away, to say the least.\" And out of all Anthony's songs, \"Rich Men of North Richmond\" cut the deepest. Not sure who the rich men north of Richmond are, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-snaps-at-peter-doocy\" target=\"_blank\">but I can make an educated guess</a>.</p><p><em>I wish politicians would <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/coal-miner-basketball-game-son\" target=\"_blank\">look out for miners</a>, and not just minors on an island somewhere,</em><br /><em>Lord, we got folks in the street, ain't nothing to eat,</em><br /><em>And the obese milking welfare,</em><br /><em>Well God if you're 5 foot 3 and you're 300 pounds,</em><br /><em>Taxes ought not to pay for your bags of fudge rounds,</em><br /><em>Young men are putting themselves six feet in the ground,</em><br /><em>Cause all this damn country does is keep on kicking them down...</em></p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AintGottaDollar/status/1689826860971008000\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The song blew up in such a rapid fashion, Oliver wasn't even on Twitter when it happened. He talked to Jason Howerton about where the song came from:</p><p>\"Oliver was struggling with mental health and coping with alcohol. In depths of despair, just about a month ago, Oliver got to his knees and broke down in tears. Though he wasn't a religious man, that night he promised God to get sober if he helped him follow his dream. Oliver was about 30 days sober when someone reached out and asked him to come record a song for his YouTube channel. That song was 'Rich Men North of Richmond.'\"</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jason_howerton/status/1689836688057761792\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n<p><br /></p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnrich/status/1689771083241500672\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's rare, but on occasion, social media can be used for good. \"Rich Men North of Richmond\" and all of Oliver Anthony's other songs are available on all streaming platforms.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

What pieces are in place that make the End Times possible, whether it be Israel being in the land (May 1948), the invention of Satellite TV for the whole world to watch the Two Witnesses or the precursor to the Mark of the Beast with chips being implanted right now into people\u2019s body.
