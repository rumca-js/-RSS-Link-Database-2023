The Gartner Hype Cycle charts the progression of new tech innovations, offering insights to avoid premature adoption or missed opportunities.\n\nThe report is presented in five stages. An \u201cInnovation Trigger\u201d is a significant event, such as a tech breakthrough, that generates initial buzz. Then there is the \u201cPeak of Inflated Expectations,\u201d the \u201cTrough of Disillusionment,\u201d and the \u201cSlope of Enlightenment,\u201d in which early adopters see benefits, and others begin to understand the potential the given technology offers. At the \u201cPlateau of Productivity\u201d the tech achieves mainstream acceptance and delivers broad-based benefits.\n\nBy understanding these phases, businesses can better time their tech investments. The report indicates marked changes in technology expectations. Continuous access evaluation profile (CAEP), a technology promoting the sharing of risk signals and enabling adaptive access, is still an innovation trigger. Meanwhile, technologies like zero-knowledge proofs, IoT authentication, decentralized identity, machine identity management, and identity wallets have transitioned from peak hype to the trough of disillusionment. Conversely, systems for cross-domain identity management (SCIM) rose from the trough to enlightenment on the cycle. OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect have settled into the plateau of productivity. Social identities were removed from plateau status due to their maturity and broad market penetration.\n\nThe report underscores an uptick in cross-organizational use of identities, such as federation and portable identities, spanning over two decades. A surge in identity wallets, promoting selective data sharing while preserving privacy, is anticipated to sustain this trend.\n\nDigital identity today transcends physical presence, spanning multiple systems and entities. A significant challenge for companies is overseeing machine identities. Gartner emphasizes the burgeoning ecosystem where people, machines, and organizations share and safeguard identity fragments using trusted infrastructures to access resources or validate assertions. This landscape is ripe for ongoing innovation, facilitating novel business models.\n\nA transformative wave in this year's Hype Cycle revolves around DCIs and verifiable claims (VCs). These tools foster trust in digital identities while granting users control over their virtual personas. Although maturing, the scalability and practicality of these technologies remain topics of debate, with competing specifications. Establishing trust mandates a mediator, emphasizing business models where third parties validate identity data.\n\nDigital identity management of machines, encompassing devices and workloads, emerges as a universal concern. Achieving harmony between trust levels and user experience remains paramount. Alternatives to traditional passwords, such as biometric-enhanced FIDO methods, offer superior authentication experiences. CAEP further exemplifies this by facilitating risk signal sharing, paving the way for adaptive access and ongoing session management in distributed frameworks.", "link": "https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/gartner-graduates-oauth-2-0-and-openid-connect-to-the-plateau-of-productivity", "date_published": "2023-08-11T21:38:07+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/biometricupdate", "title": "Apple files patents to enhance iris biometrics authenticator, let systems read lips", "description": "<img alt=\"apple\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://d1sr9z1pdl3mb7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/27135458/apple.jpg\" width=\"1440\" />\n\t\t<a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/apple\">Apple</a> has had three patent applications published that could enhance its biometric authenticator Optic ID feature and equip its devices to reads lips.\n\nThe first two patent filings could be used in its mixed-reality headset Vision Pro, <a href=\"https://www.patentlyapple.com/2023/08/two-apple-vision-pro-patents-surface-in-europe-detailing-optic-id-apples-latest-form-of-biometric-identification.html\">according</a> to trade publication Patently Apple.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/description?CC=EP&amp;NR=4217919A1&amp;KC=A1&amp;FT=D&amp;ND=&amp;date=20230802&amp;DB=&amp;locale=en_EP\">first patent</a> published describes a multi-camera biometric imaging system while the <a href=\"https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/description?CC=EP&amp;NR=4217920A1&amp;KC=A1&amp;FT=D&amp;ND=&amp;date=20230802&amp;DB=&amp;locale=en_EP\">second one</a> describes the \u201cautomatic selection of biometric based on the quality of acquired image.\u201d Both patents are designed for biometric authentication and eye tracking. The two patent documents were published by the European patent office last week.\n\nThe Vision Pro was <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/apple-vision-pro-headset-to-have-optic-id-biometrics-built-in\">revealed</a> in June at the company\u2019s annual developers\u2019 conference. It uses the iris-identifiying Optic ID, enabling owners to unlock the Vision Pro by putting it on. Eye tracking is performed by two infrared cameras and a ring of LEDs in the mask. The headset is expected to ship early next year for US$3,499.\n\nApple's <a href=\"https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/20230245657\">third patent</a> filing was published by the U.S. patent office and describes how devices, and presumably its digital assistant Siri, could use motion sensors to detect a user\u2019s mouth. The \"Keyword Detection Using Motion Sensing\" patent could save power as accelerometers and gyroscopes expend relatively little power compared to audio sensors such as microphones. The patent was <a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/08/03/apple-is-teaching-siri-how-to-read-lips\">unearthed</a> last week by Apple Insider.\n\nOther recent Apple patents <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/apple-looks-to-protect-ip-on-biometrics-for-vision-correction-and-headset-authentication\">include</a> innovations in facial recognition software that could help combat poor eyesight in its mixed-reality headsets.

They are calling for a \"secure authentication roadmap.\"\n\nA lack of universally adopted standards is a situation that U.S. government and businesses can no longer tolerate. The review board is a body with the Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/\">Agency</a>.\n\nThe board writes that the \"roadmap should include standards and frameworks, guidance, tools, and technology specific to organizations\u2019 needs and circumstances that account for size, industry, threat profile, as well as privacy and civil liberties considerations.\"\n\nWhile the federal government creates or adopts all kinds of standards for industry \u2013 for drinkable water, for instance \u2013 it has largely left the information technology industry to compete its way to effective digital identity standards. That's especially true with foundational matters requiring coordination.\n\nIt's doubtful the executive, legislative or even judicial branches will go along with the proposed activist role in an age when state and local governments are buffeted by fractious electorates who do not even agree on the danger of Covid.\n\nThat probably leaves CISA officials doing what they can to support the FIDO Alliance and like organizations.\n\nThe review board calls for application developers to make consumer devices FIDO2 compliant with hardware-backed components by default, for example.\n\nAnother guideline mentioned, this one aimed at reducing social engineering, is to make it a requirement to create an explicit authentication process using FIDO2-compliant tokens or other phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication methods.", "link": "https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/us-cyber-safety-board-wants-feds-more-involved-in-eliminating-passwords", "date_published": "2023-08-11T20:19:16+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/biometricupdate", "title": "Japan trying to get it right with national digital ID, public losing faith", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://d1sr9z1pdl3mb7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/22211640/japan-my-number-card-scaled.jpg\" width=\"2048\" />\n\t\tAfter a series of high-profile data leaks and registration errors in Japan\u2019s digital IDs, the program is undergoing a government inspection to prevent further problems and public backlash.\n\nTuesday, government officials issued an interim report that found 1,000 new cases in which the <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/my-number\">My Number national identification cards</a> were mistakenly linked with the medical information of others. Kyodo News <a href=\"https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2023/08/c71f87aebf48-japan-pm-calls-for-review-of-all-my-number-card-data-by-end-of-nov.html\">reports</a> that 7,400 cases have already been made public, .\n\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida instructed ministers to examine all data on My Number cards by the end of November.\n\nThe troubled digital ID system, which provides citizens and foreign residents with a 12-digit number linked to their personal data, has been one of the factors behind a significant drop in Kishida\u2019s cabinet's approval in recent months, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-04/japan-pm-apologizes-for-id-card-problems-as-he-backs-its-use#xj4y7vzkg\">according</a> to Bloomberg. Last week, the prime minister apologized for problems with ID cards but said that he wouldn\u2019t necessarily back down on plans for integrating them into the healthcare system.\n\n\u201cWhat Japan is aiming for is to become the world\u2019s most advanced, smart government,\u201d said Kishida. \u201cTo that end, we must work on digital infrastructure and government systems.\u201d\n\nMy Number includes data such as photo and names and can be used to access government services, including tax and social security records, as well as some bank accounts. Citizens can choose to use face biometrics <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202110/japanese-government-selects-safr-face-biometrics-for-in-person-service-access\">provided by RealNetworks</a>.\n\nAs of late July, 77 percent of the population, 89 million people, had applied for the cards. But the system has met resistance, especially among Japan\u2019s aging population.\n\nTo kickstart use of the cards and a larger digital transformation, the government came up with a plan to merge health insurance cards with the My Number cards last October. Digital Minister Taro Kono proposed integrating national insurance certificates with My Number cards by fall 2024.\n\nThat plan, however, has caused a backlash. In February, doctors <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202302/doctors-in-japan-challenge-govt-mandatory-use-of-digital-id-for-health-services\">took the government to court</a> over My Number use. The Japan Times <a href=\"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/podcast/2023/08/10/deep-dive/my-number-digitalization/\">cited</a> a June survey of medical and dental practitioners that found nearly 60 percent of Japanese medical institutions had experienced problems, including insurance data linked to the wrong card.\n\nMany of the issues with erroneous linking are connected with manual data entry. Parents, for instance, have been applying for cards for their children, but then registering their own bank accounts with their children's accounts, in an effort to state benefits directly. Some residents, however, have discovered<a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/mixed-progress-for-digital-ids-linked-to-payments-in-japan-australia-and-india\"> their ID cards are linked to unrelated personal information</a>. While 55 million people have linked their cards to their bank accounts, at least 130,000 cases resulted in someone other than the cardholder being linked.\n\nThis week\u2019s interim report also showed that 20 percent of prefecture and major cities have registered My Number cards with someone else's personal information on disability certificates.\n\nPolls conducted in July by media outlets Yomiuri and NNN also showed that 58 percent of respondents were against using ID cards for healthcare purposes, while 80 percent said they did not believe that the government could fix the problem. Kishida\u2019s approval was at 35 percent, the lowest since winning election in 2021.\n\nDespite the setbacks, government officials say they will continue merging the My Number system with health insurance cards by the deadline. They want to neutralize criticism that they lag behind peer countries in digitalization. Kishida said that those who do not complete the My Number merge will receive a separate certificate that could be used for a maximum of five years.", "link": "https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/japan-trying-to-get-it-right-with-national-digital-id-public-losing-faith", "date_published": "2023-08-11T19:45:57+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/biometricupdate", "title": "eConnect and CasinoTrac integrate facial recognition to improve casino experiences", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"1367\" src=\"https://d1sr9z1pdl3mb7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/16152124/gaming-machines-scaled.jpg\" width=\"2048\" />\n\t\t<a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/econnect\">eConnect</a> has collaborated with <a href=\"https://www.casinotrac.com/\">CasinoTrac</a>, integrating real-time casino data with facial recognition. This joint venture, recently rolled out in what the partners describe as a major Native American casino in Texas, promises heightened Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and security measures, streamlined surveillance, and an improved experience for valued patrons.\n\nWhile many casinos heavily invest in surveillance, they often lack a consolidated facial recognition system. Conventionally, venues have had to match individuals with reference pictures manually. This process is time-consuming and lacks comprehensive data correlation with identity databases in disparate areas of the casino.\n\neConnect\u2019s facial recognition system integrates with all major casino systems, automating the identification process and collating all the data into a central database, according to the announcement. This allows for speedy and automatic recognition of employees, VIPs, and bad actors. This system provides immediate alerts to staff in the event of suspicious activity. Additionally, when high-stake players arrive, the system instantly notifies the host, enabling casinos to provide tailored services, from personal greetings to complimentary offers.\n\nHenry Valentino III, eConnect's CEO, describes the partnership as transformative for the gaming and hospitality sectors. \"The integration of real-time data from CasinoTrac's CMS amplifies our facial recognition capabilities. We can now swiftly identify high-value patrons, bolstering security and simplifying surveillance operations,\" stated Valentino.\n\nChad Hoehne, President of Table Trac Inc., which designs, develops, and sells CasinoTrac, praises the swift market introduction of the project, adding, \"Making real-time data accessible to operators and third-party associates should be the norm, and we're thrilled to pave the way.\"\n\nThis collaboration showcases the potential of harnessing facial recognition technology to provide patrons with a secure, tailored experience while bolstering the gaming industry\u2019s security and operational effectiveness, according to the announcement.\n\nKonami\u2019s facial recognition for <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202303/australian-gambling-machine-maker-licenses-konami-facial-recognition\">player identification and loyalty programs</a> was licensed by an Australian gaming machine supplier earlier this year.", "link": "https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/econnect-and-casinotrac-integrate-facial-recognition-to-improve-casino-experiences", "date_published": "2023-08-11T19:07:38+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/biometricupdate", "title": "Biometrics enrollment partners of Nigeria\u2019s digital ID project claim payment backlog", "description": "<img alt=\"NIMC Nigeria digital ID card\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"549\" src=\"https://d1sr9z1pdl3mb7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03132114/NIMC-Nigeria-digital-ID-card.png\" width=\"976\" />\n\t\tSome private partners licensed by the National Identity Management Commission of Nigeria (NIMC) to enroll citizens for the country\u2019s national identification number (NIN) program have reached out to President Ahmed Bola Tinubu for help over unpaid debts.\n\nIn an <a href=\"https://dailytrust.com/president-tinubu-nin-enrolment-partners-are-being-suffocated/\">open letter</a> published by Nigeria\u2019s Daily Trust newspaper on August 8, one of the agents, Ibrahim Usman, writing from Kaduna, says he is among those who have not been paid by the NIMC for the past one year and eight months.\n\nIn the letter addressed to Tinubu, Usman says they toiled in villages, towns and cities of the country to enroll citizens for the NIN, but their claims for payment for their services, for nearly two years now, have yet to be paid by the NIMC. The agency blames the delay on an ongoing wait for funds to be disbursed by Nigeria\u2019s Ministry of Finance.\n\nPer the letter, the NIMC entered into an agreement with some agents in 2020 to carry out NIN enrollment at the cost of $1 per successful registration, and the partners were expected to prefinance some of the cost by procuring biometric equipment for the exercise.\n\n\u201cWe have contributed immensely to the realization of over 100 million NINs captured in the NIMC database, which was widely celebrated by the then Minister of Communications and Digital Economy without finding it necessary to settle the real foot soldiers that carried out the exercise,\u201d Usman writes.\n\nHe adds that many of the agents are young graduates who underwent training for the enrollment using their own funds. \u201cIndividuals sourced loans from banks, relations and other financial institutions and purchased the necessary equipment and spent lots on logistics for the success of the exercise, but we are being abandoned with no any communication from both licensees and NIMC,\u201d a portion of Usman\u2019s letter reads.\n\n\u201cWe have lodged several complaints with the NIMC, Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy and other identified stakeholders to consider our plight but to no avail.

It makes the case that biometrics and liveness detection are the technologies that can enable secure and accessible digital identity.\n\n\u201c<a href=\"https://go.iproov.com/rs/891-TPZ-847/images/Unlocking%20Financial%20Inclusion%20EUDIW%20Whitepaper%20iProov.pdf\">Unlocking Financial Inclusion with Digital Identity and Biometric Verification: European Digital Identity Wallet Use Case</a>\u201d is a 14-page paper that starts with explanations of why legal identity is important, and how digital identity can boost financial inclusion. It proceeds to a review of the EU Digital Identity Wallet (EUDIW) and the pilots being conducted with it.\n\nAny financial inclusion project takes on the risk of onboarding people new to the financial system, providing ideal cover for fraudsters, the paper points out. That means strong binding to the official document used as Personal Identification Data (PID) is necessary.\n\niProov goes on to explain why liveness detection is more secure than video call verification, which can be spoofed with generative AI and a forged ID document. Presentation attacks and digital injection attacks are compared, and the imbalance in testing regimes explained.\n\nThe final section applies these observations to the challenge of increasing the inclusivity of digital identity in the European Union. iProov notes that 24 percent of EU citizens have some form of disability, and 10 percent belong to racial or ethnic minorities, while technology literacy varies heavily from country to country.\n\nThis makes the convenience and ease-of-use of face biometrics and liveness detection appealing, the company argues.\n\nThe Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) already provides a best practice standard for making digital interactions accessible to all that biometrics vendors can use to improve their software.\n\nCompliance with WCAG and other accessibility standards plus strong defense against injection attacks will allow the EU to meet its inclusivity goals with face biometrics, iProov concludes.\n\nAjay Amlani, President and head of Americas for iProov, discussed the need to <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/california-tests-iowa-launches-digital-ids-while-michigan-considers-legislation\">protect against injection attacks</a> in a recent email to <em>Biometric Update</em>.", "link": "https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/accessible-face-biometrics-can-boost-financial-inclusion-iproov-argues", "date_published": "2023-08-11T16:31:17+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/biometricupdate", "title": "Aware, Signzy and iDenfy strike deals to deploy face biometrics for gambling compliance", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"1367\" src=\"https://d1sr9z1pdl3mb7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/11121342/online-gambling-scaled.jpg\" width=\"2048\" />\n\t\tCompanies providing gambling both <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/uk-government-says-online-age-verification-is-effective\">online</a> and <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202303/australian-gambling-machine-maker-licenses-konami-facial-recognition\">in-person</a> are embracing biometrics as a tool for complying with regulations and preventing fraud, and new agreements have been reached by Aware, Signzy and iDenfy to extend face biometrics to more betters.\n\nLas Vegas-based online gambling and casino advisory SCCG Management has agreed to a distribution deal with <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/aware-inc\">Aware</a> to bring the latter\u2019s face biometrics enrollment, authentication, and identity verification to the gaming industry.\n\nThe strategic partnership announcement notes the potential of biometrics for seamless transactions and easier logins.\n\n\"From identity verification to frictionless logins, Aware is excited to help gaming operators improve their player's experience while ensuring the best in compliance and security with simplified biometrics,\u201d says Aware CFO Dave Barcelo.\n\nSCCG Management Founder and CEO Stephen Crystal refers to Aware\u2019s biometric software as \u201cbest-in-class.\u201d\n\n\u201cSCCG Management is perfectly positioned to distribute these advanced KYC solutions to our extensive network of industry operators,\u201d he adds. \u201cThis partnership aligns with our mission to provide cutting-edge solutions that not only improve the user experience but also uphold the highest standards of security and compliance.\"\n\n<a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/signzy\">Signzy</a> has signed a strategic partnership with Slots Temple, a popular website for virtual slot machines and online tournaments.

The organization has so far helped provide 8,000 state-issued IDs and is hoping to increase this figure to more than 17,000 ID\u2019s this year.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get a job, you can\u2019t get housing, can\u2019t cash a check, can\u2019t open a bank account, can\u2019t enter rehab programs,\u201d says Rick Mitchell, executive director of the Homeless ID Project. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have an ID if you want to change your life.\u201d\n\nSimilar efforts have also been seen in some developing nations where many people lack identification documents.
