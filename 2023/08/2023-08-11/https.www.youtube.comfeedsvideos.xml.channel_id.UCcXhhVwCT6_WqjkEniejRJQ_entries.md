Thanks to Yan and Tom for fantastic work on the Tightinator Software:

The creators of the software describes it as 
"A Website that takes a wav file and outputs a csv file of all peak timings and supports that data with graphs. Its goal is to save time and help in the pursuit of an ever tighter marble machine."

Thank you for helping out with the Marble Machine process.

The prototype is designed to answer the age old question: Can I play tight music using a very strong flywheel? The new flywheel have 20x more moment of inertia compared to the MMX Flywheel.

We are recording at the wonderful location of Siegfrieds Mechanical Music Museum in Rudesheim Am Rhein, Germany. Check out their youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@Musikkabinett
