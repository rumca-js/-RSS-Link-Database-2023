Microsoft has long been one of several companies that attempted to monopolize repair in a bid for profit, particularly when it has come to the company&#8217;s game consoles.

This is and will keep happening. As complicated a landscape as copyright law is, the idea of automating the policing of copyright infringement without creating all kinds of collateral damage is simply absurd.

Three years ago we had the CEO of Jungle Scout, Greg Mercer, on our podcast, to debunk the claim that Amazon was unfairly competing with third party sellers in the Amazon marketplace. It’s become somewhat accepted wisdom that Amazon is engaged in some sort of predatory behavior, looking at what products sell well with data [&#8230;]

It&#8217;s a fact: You can violate a government employee&#8217;s rights while being a government employee. Sure, it&#8217;s more tricky than violating rights as a government employee (when targeting non-government employees), but it can still be done. Constitutional protections are a bit more limited for government employees, but they don&#8217;t cease to exist. Every American has [&#8230;]

Here on Techdirt we’ve chronicled the rise of a bunch of terrible age verification laws, including many focused specifically on adult content. We’ve also highlighted how MindGeek, the company behind a bunch of largest adult content sites, including Pornhub, have started geoblocking entire states in response to these problematic laws, while the Free Speech Coalition [&#8230;]

Since its beginning in 2016, the absurd saga has generated hundreds of billions in debt, saw more than&#160;50,000 [&#8230;]

We get opacity, violence, and insular behavior any time we [&#8230;]
