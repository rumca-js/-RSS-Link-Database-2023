Tor is the privacy-focused web browser best known for its connections to the \u201cdark web,\u201d or unlisted websites. Run as a non-profit, the developers behind Tor run a system that routes web traffic through various \u201ctunnels\u201d to obscure who you are and what you\u2019re browsing on the web. IPFS, or the InterPlanetary File System, is an open-source set of protocols behind the internet, mainly used for file sharing or publishing data on a decentralized network.</p><p>The bigger Veilid gets, the more secure it will be as well, according to Rioux. The strength doesn\u2019t come from the number of apps made on the framework, but by how many people use the apps to further the routing of nodes that make up the network. \u201cThe network gains strength by a single popular app,\u201d Rioux said. \u201cThe big Veilid network is supported by the entire ecosystem not just your app.\u201d In the presentation, cDc likened the nodes to mutual aid in the sense that they work to strengthen and support each other to make the entire network more secure.</p><p>Rious explained that VLD0 will be the cryptography \u2014 the protocols that keep information secure \u2014 behind Veilid. It\u2019s a mix of existing cryptography frameworks, like Ed25519 to support authentication efforts and xChaCha20-Poy1305 as its 192-bit encryption support. But, recognizing that advancing technology will change cryptography needs over time, cDc already has a plan to handle updates. \u201cEvery new version of our crypto system is supported alongside the old ones\u201d so that there are no gaps in security, Rioux said. cDc also put other measures in place like anti-spoofing, end-to-end encryption even at rest and data protection even if you lose your device.</p><p>Veiled and cDc aim to build an approachable internet with fewer ads and more privacy, according to Bowden. Veilid Chat, a messaging app similar to Signal, will be the first app built on the framework. You\u2019ll be able to sign up without using a phone number, to decrease personal identifiers, Bowden told Engadget in an email.</p><p>cDc is currently in the process of putting together a community and foundation to support the project. \u201cThere are a lot of folks who can\u2019t see past web3 as far as privacy (we are more like the web2 we should have had), and really can\u2019t process the idea that we\u2019re doing this without a profit motive,\u201d Bowden said.</p><p>Known as the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-10-hitting-the-books-cult-of-the-dead-cow-joseph-menn.html\">original hacking supergroup</a>,\u201d cDc\u2019s most noted accomplishments include inventing hacktivism, helping to develop Tor and pushing top companies to take privacy seriously.

Engadget's Jeff Dunn particularly liked the impressive battery life, which can go for 300 hours on a charge. The set is also comfortable to wear for hours on end so you can test out that capacity for yourself. The sound is a little bass heavy and the mic isn't as great as others in its field, but the headset is perfectly serviceable. Jeff does point out that HyperX's companion software has been known to introduce latency, so you're better off going with third-party or built-in controls for audio EQ adjustments.

The previous wording said it wouldn\u2019t do so \u201cwithout customer consent,\u201d which raised eyebrows since \u201cconsent\u201d was (at best) a gray area for people joining a call (and acknowledging a pop-up) in which the meeting organizer enabled the feature and already agreed to the terms.</p><p>Zoom\u2019s changes were listed in a preamble update to its <a href=\"https://blog.zoom.us/zooms-term-service-ai/\">previous blog post</a>. \u201cFollowing feedback received regarding Zoom\u2019s recently updated terms of service, particularly related to our new generative artificial intelligence features, Zoom has updated our terms of service and the below blog post to make it clear that Zoom does not use any of your audio, video, chat, screen-sharing, attachments, or other communications like customer content (such as poll results, whiteboard, and reactions) to train Zoom\u2019s or third-party artificial intelligence models,\u201d the notice reads.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Indeed, the previously troublesome section 10 in Zoom\u2019s terms of service, related to AI and consumer data, has also changed. \u201cZoom does not use any of your audio, video, chat, screen sharing, attachments or other communications-like Customer Content (such as poll results, whiteboard and reactions) to train Zoom or third-party artificial intelligence models,\u201d the updated version reads.

While that might make your skin crawl if you\u2019re squeamish, \u201cfor the most part, they\u2019re not really noticeable,\u201d she told Engadget. At the <a href=\"https://forum.defcon.org/node/246100\">DEF CON security conference</a> on Thursday, Windall talked about how she became interested in the implants, and her experience programming them for personal use, like scanning into her former office building.</p><p>RFID tech powers scannable technology like subway cards or tap to pay. The relatively simple tech was <a href=\"https://www.rfidjournal.com/the-history-of-rfid-technology#:~:text=Mario%20W.,a%20door%20without%20a%20key.\">first patented in the 1970s</a>, and body modification dates back millennia. Despite this, RFID implants still haven\u2019t reached their full potential, and they\u2019re still a gimmick for a lot of people, Windall said. But if you want to go clubbing and not bring a bag, you can buy the right style of lock and implant a sensor that you can\u2019t lose to scan in and out of your home.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Still, they\u2019re not magic. \u201cChip implants don't work like Hollywood movies,\u201d founder of biohacking and implant service Dangerous Things Amal Graafstra told Engadget. \u201cThey're not even active or alive or energized when there's no reader that is within a very close proximity\u201d</p><p>That means the scope of use for RFID implants is pretty limited and it\u2019s mostly a foundational tech that you\u2019d have to be able to hack yourself for it to be useful. There are limited out-of-the-box use cases, like <a href=\"https://dangerousthings.com/product/teslaflex/\">the Tesla keycard implant</a> that lets you start your car, but usually a user has to be able to copy certain key configurations onto it themself. \u201cWhen we sell the transponder, we\u2019re selling a key but not the lock,\u201d Graafstra said. The user has to have some technical savvy to make \u201cthe lock.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s helpful to know that before going to a body modification artist or piercer to get one put in, or else you might end up with a chip you can\u2019t use. \u201cDo your research and make sure what you want as possible before you have surgery,\u201d Windall said. Although, Windall herself does have some inactive ones that are harmless to keep under the skin.</p><p>Companies are now looking for ways to use RFID implants as security tools, too. There\u2019s an inherent vulnerability associated with RFID tech because it requires access credentials to be open to being stolen. But having those credentials as an implant at least prevents someone from easily stealing your access card or information.</p><p>\u201cThe chances of someone coming along and being able to scan your credential without you knowing about it, it's probably not that high,\u201d Windall said. \u201cYou can't have your hand pickpocketed, at least not without a machete.\u201d</p><p>Plus as authentication becomes more important to prevent unauthorized account access, these implants could be used to prove your identity. As companies look to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/passkeys-passwords-authentication-security-133024414.html\">replace two-factor authentication with passkeys</a>, putting those credentials under your skin could be possible. Your passkey can be uploaded to a chip implant that can verify your identity, as opposed to a hardware key that could get lost or a text message verification that can be duped, according to Graafstra.</p><p>RFID implants don\u2019t require FDA approval because they\u2019re not medical devices. While they appear generally safe and secure, there are risk factors to consider, according to professor in the College of Media at the University of Colorado Boulder <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32426543/\">Harsha Gangadharbatla</a>, PhD.</p><p>\u201cConsumers should be fully aware of the \u201chidden\u201d costs (privacy, risks, and advertising messages) associated with such tech and not just the cost of getting such implants,\u201d he said in an email to Engadget.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/chip-implants-get-under-your-skin-so-you-can-leave-your-keys-at-home-170008199.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/chip-implants-get-under-your-skin-so-you-can-leave-your-keys-at-home-170008199.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-08-11T17:00:08+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones and earbuds are reportedly on the way", "description": "<p>Bose is reportedly preparing to launch some new headphones and earbuds, a refresh in the QuietComfort line, <a href=\"https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-first-look-revealed-exclusive/\"><ins>as leaked by </ins><em><ins>MySmartPrice.</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>The Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds will be a successor to the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-2-review-130026306.html\"><ins>well-reviewed QuietComfort Earbuds II</ins></a> and the QuietComfort Ultra headphones look to be a more premium-take on the company\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/bose-quietcomfort-45-review-143031637.html\"><ins>QuietComfort 45 headphones.</ins></a></p><p>One of the highlights of any Bose product, and particularly the QuietComfort II earbuds, is active noise cancellation.

Like with last year\u2019s iPhone 13s, this year\u2019s models don\u2019t come with ac power adapters, so that\u2019s one thing you\u2019ll probably need to have on hand. If you plan on going all-in on wireless charging, you can take advantage of the best MagSafe technology with the many accessories to choose. We\u2019ve tested out some of the best iPhone accessories available, from the Apple AirTag to wireless headphones to phone cases, and gathered the best ones here.</p><h2>Apple MagSafe wireless charger</h2><p></p><p>There are often better and cheaper alternatives to Apple\u2019s first-party accessories, but the company\u2019s <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BcHBsZS1NSFhIM0FNLUEtTWFnU2FmZS1DaGFyZ2VyL2RwL0IwOEw1TlA2Tkc_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZWEtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjYyN2FmM2ZkLTU5NGItMzE3OS04YzEzLWJhZGYzOTQwOTBjMCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAaRxUzZ1Mh5KMgSPjBoTccOKa-8hj3LtggM_hnahkFeW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-MHXH3AM-A-MagSafe-Charger%2Fdp%2FB08L5NP6NG\">MagSafe wireless charger</a> is worth considering if you have a new iPhone. Like all other MagSafe accessories, this charging pad uses magnets to attach to the back of the latest iPhones and it\u2019s surprisingly strong. Not only can you safely pick up your handset and use it with the disk still attached, but the iPhone can dangle by the charger\u2019s cord without falling off. (You still probably shouldn\u2019t do this.)</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The charging plate itself is about a quarter-inch thick so it barely adds any heft to the iPhone. The magnets only attach to the latest iPhones, but it will still charge older models wirelessly, going back to the iPhone 8. I only wish the cable were longer than three feet so that you had more leeway to use your iPhone on the couch or in bed while powering it up.</p><p>Apple\u2019s MagSafe charger accessory comes in at $39 (although we\u2019ve seen it go on sale a few times), but if you want to spend a bit less, <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TcGlnZW4tQXJjRmllbGQtTWFnbmV0aWMtV2lyZWxlc3MtQ29tcGF0aWJsZS9kcC9CMDhLM1laNTM1P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWVhLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2MjdhZjNmZC01OTRiLTMxNzktOGMxMy1iYWRmMzk0MDkwYzAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAW7_RLl0A0JotuPt2TK6AQhpSeA4qI36-2JHt1G3f1jM&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSpigen-ArcField-Magnetic-Wireless-Compatible%2Fdp%2FB08K3YZ535\">Spigen\u2019s $25 ArcField magnetic wireless charger</a> is a decent dupe.

It also has an optional attachment for an Apple Watch, which means it could actually charge up to five devices at the same time.</p><p>I found the mat useful as a charging hub, turning to it each night to charge my iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods Pro. It\u2019s worth noting that both my iPhone and my AirPods Pro live in cases, and I didn\u2019t have to remove either in order to charge them with Mophie\u2019s mat. But while the mat\u2019s size allows it to do a lot at once, it\u2019s also tough to find a big enough spot for it. It\u2019ll fit on most nightstands, but you may have to rearrange things first.

First, it\u2019s more affordable than Apple\u2019s \u2014 you\u2019ll pay $19 for a three-foot cable from Apple, whereas Anker\u2019s three-foot cord costs $13. It also has MFi-certification, which means it\u2019s passed enough tests to get Apple\u2019s seal of approval as a safe, reliable iOS accessory. While not all of them are made out of braided nylon, those that don\u2019t still have a 12,000-bend lifespan so you can use it without fear of wire fraying after a few weeks. Anker also has a similar USB-C to C cable in the Powerline III series that should work well for charging the latest iPads and MacBooks.</p><h2>Belkin MagSafe Car Vent Mount Pro</h2><p></p><p>Belkin\u2019s<a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9CZWxraW4tTWFnU2FmZS1pUGhvbmUtTWFnbmV0aWNhbGx5LU1vdW50ZWQvZHAvQjA4TFFWRDZaUj90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1lYS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNjI3YWYzZmQtNTk0Yi0zMTc5LThjMTMtYmFkZjM5NDA5MGMwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAc2tF5-CiUqxL7nlENaLTkPHw0LX1Le1V1K8WyF2wUoc&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBelkin-MagSafe-iPhone-Magnetically-Mounted%2Fdp%2FB08LQVD6ZR&amp;uuid=ThGvfypGCJC8YIRI48312\"> MagSafe car mount</a> is easier to use than one of those fussy clamps you pray will stay put on a vent while you\u2019re driving. The strong magnets truly make this one of the best iPhone accessories \u2014 the iPhone 14 snaps into place on the mount\u2019s credit-card sized plate and doesn\u2019t budge even if you have to quickly swerve to avoid hitting a squirrel. The clip that attaches to your car\u2019s vent is also quite snug and you can swivel your cell phone into landscape or portrait mode.</p><p>Even if you don\u2019t drive to work on a daily basis anymore, this will come in handy on the days you\u2019re in the office and when you need to consult Google Maps during your next roadtrip. Just remember that this mount won\u2019t charge your iPhone; it\u2019s just a magnetic holder. You can, however, weave a charging cable through an opening in the back of the mount so you can neatly power up your phone while driving.</p><h2>Peak Design Mobile Tripod</h2><p></p><p>There are plenty of ways to prop up your iPhone, but <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8747aed1-6586-46eb-856d-c95a5318901b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Peak+Design&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4NzQ3YWVkMS02NTg2LTQ2ZWItODU2ZC1jOTVhNTMxODkwMWIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGVha2Rlc2lnbi5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvbW9iaWxlLXRyaXBvZD8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjYyN2FmM2ZkLTU5NGItMzE3OS04YzEzLWJhZGYzOTQwOTBjMCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAASyTOhhwHMhqG8nLd7TCmkJkpkbHN7UCdl0Bm4ZkTHmu&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.peakdesign.com%2Fproducts%2Fmobile-tripod%3F\">Peak Design\u2019s mobile tripod</a> is one of the more elegant solutions I\u2019ve tried. This iPhone accessory is a 0.3-inch thick plate made of anodized aluminum with strong magnets inside and three legs that fold down and out. It attaches to the back of the latest iPhone and delivers a generous lift off the surface it\u2019s sitting on. Out of all of the stands I\u2019ve used, it\u2019s the one that looks and feels most like a tripod thanks to its micro ball-head, which lets you adjust the angle of your phone nearly 360 degrees, and its three legs, which provide much more support and functionality than your standard phone-case kickstand.</p><p>The Mobile Tripod is a solid option for those who use their phone cameras for everything from family photos to vacation landscape shots, and those who want to use their phone almost as a second screen while traveling. It\u2019s a bit steep at $80, but you\u2019re paying for a sturdy accessory with a thoughtful design \u2014 plus the Peak name.

It\u2019s a clear cover that has anti-yellowing properties, which should keep your iPhone 14 Pro looking clean and new for longer than other cases, and it'll work well with any screen protector you might already have on your phone. Raised edges help protect the screen and camera array from making too much contact with other surfaces, and you\u2019ll be able to use it with any magnetic accessories you want.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-iphone-accessories-140022449.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-iphone-accessories-140022449.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-08-11T13:48:14+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Engadget Podcast: Are Samsung's foldables getting stale?", "description": "<p>This week, Cherlynn and Sam are joined by noted foldables lover Michael Fisher (aka Mr Mobile) to talk all about their respective reviews of Samsung\u2019s latest products.

You can buy them in black or white, wired or wireless, and with at least a dozen key switch options. And every year they\u2019ve gotten bigger and more complex, with media buttons and macro keys and bright rainbow LED backlighting. However, this past year has seen some manufacturers go in the opposite direction, introducing 60 percent keyboards that are cute and compact, taking up less desk space. But are they worth buying?</p><h2>How many keys does a 60 percent keyboard have?</h2><figure><img alt=\"60-percent keyboards on a bed of colored paper\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/5a90e3a0-be53-11eb-b7fa-c327152e5d08\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>First off, it\u2019s worth noting that the best gaming keyboards tend to follow one of three different configurations. The most common one is the full-size keyboard, which will usually have somewhere between 100 and 110 keys, depending on whether the manufacturer includes media buttons or macro keys. There\u2019s always a function row located along the top of the keyboard, and a number pad on the far right. Most gamers will prefer a full-size model rather than a compact keyboard because it lets them perform many  different functions with just one press, and set up macros for activities that aren\u2019t already built-in to the keyboard.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Tenkeyless decks have been pretty common for a while now; those are keyboards that omit the number pad on the right. That\u2019s it. They still have function keys and media controls, but they\u2019re narrower since they omit 17 keys. Yeah, it\u2019s actually more than 10 keys but \u201cseventeenkeyless\u201d doesn\u2019t have the same ring to it. Gamers might opt for one of these when they need a little more space on their desk, and they don\u2019t need a quick way to enter numbers or do calculations (which is my number one use case for the right-hand pad).</p><p>Then there are 60 percent keyboards which, as the name indicates, drop 40 percent of the standard keyboard size and only have 61 keys. Not only do they just remove the num pad, but the function keys are gone, along with the arrow keys and those weird system keys like \u201cprint screen\u201d and \u201chome\u201d that are only useful when you happen to need them. On some computers they don\u2019t even work.</p><p>On a 60 percent keyboard you\u2019ll access these buttons by using the function key; there\u2019s no standard layout between companies so you\u2019ll have to learn new hotkeys and shortcuts if you switch between manufacturers like Razer, HyperX or Corsair. They also lack built-in wrist rests that would make them more ergonomic, though the height is at least adjustable.</p><p>Razer also just introduced a 65 percent keyboard, a less common configuration which keeps the arrow keys and some functions but still tosses the rest to maintain a reduced profile. This is probably a preferred option if you use the arrow keys a lot. I need them because I edit a lot of text, and some games may use them instead of the standard WASD array for controlling your character.</p><h2>What are the benefits of a 60 percent keyboard?</h2><figure><img alt=\"60-percent keyboards on a bed of colored paper\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/b2aeb850-be53-11eb-abdf-50ff2f0f3988\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>With so many functions removed, why buy a 60 percent keyboard? The number one reason to use a compact keyboard is space of course. If you\u2019re gaming in tight spaces or just have a lot of crap on your desk like I do, not having to shove stuff aside just to make some elbow room is nice. It\u2019s especially helpful if you tend to eat near your computer, as a 60 percent keyboard\u2019s small size makes it easy to push out of the way to rest a plate or bowl on your desk. It actually keeps the keyboard a lot cleaner, too, since I can easily shake crumbs out of it with one hand.</p><p>A smaller keyboard size also makes it more portable, obviously, with a 60 percent keyboard taking up less space than a laptop in your bag, though it\u2019s still a little thick. They do have lower-profile keys than standard decks at least, though if thickness is your number one concern then carrying around a mechanical keyboard is probably not for you.</p><p>One big feature that doesn\u2019t get talked about a lot is that all of the recent 60 (and 65) percent decks are not wireless keyboards and use detachable USB-C cords. So if you switch between workspaces often, you can easily leave a cord at each desk to quickly plug in your keyboard. As someone who tests a lot of keyboards I\u2019ve found this handy because I have connection options and can switch out the deck and leave the cord intact. It\u2019s often a real pain to have to unplug cords and untangle them from my office setup every time I try a new keyboard, but for the 60 percent models I\u2019ve been using the same wire for all of them.</p><h2>The best for most gamers: Razer Huntsman Mini</h2><p></p><p>The best of the major 60 percent keyboards out there right now is the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9SYXplci1IdW50c21hbi1NaW5pLUdhbWluZy1LZXlib2FyZC9kcC9CMDhCM0pTS0dSP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTN6LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhNDA4NmZlMC0yNDE3LTRjM2QtYjljZS05OWQ2ODBkYjhhMzQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWWG-TGnhSyk7GPaGqgjmFyZbbX4L13NGQ4kwIBNxy0s&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FRazer-Huntsman-Mini-Gaming-Keyboard%2Fdp%2FB08B3JSKGR%3F\">Huntsman Mini</a>. It uses Razer\u2019s opto-mechanical switches, which I haven\u2019t been too fond of in the past, but the company seems to have made some changes that make it a much more pleasant typing experience. This gaming keyboard is quiet and smooth with good response time, though people who prefer a springy key feel should look elsewhere. It\u2019s not a wireless keyboard, so if you take it on the go you\u2019ll need to make sure you always have a USB-C cable handy. The Huntsman Mini gaming keyboard also comes in white, which means it\u2019ll blend into your decor more than most gaming accessories, especially if you choose to customize the LED lighting effects.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Attractive; good typing feel; comes in white.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> No wireless connectivity; not everyone will be a fan of opto-mechanical keys.</p><h2>Runner up: HyperX Alloy Origins 60</h2><p></p><p>If you need a solid, sturdy brick of a 60 percent keyboard, the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9IeXBlclgtQWxsb3ktT3JpZ2lucy1NZWNoYW5pY2FsLUNvbXBhdGlibGUvZHAvQjA4WEJRNzlNTj90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby0zei0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTQwODZmZTAtMjQxNy00YzNkLWI5Y2UtOTlkNjgwZGI4YTM0In0&amp;signature=AQAAAchQygphEv8ZvcG_rVoTqgg5VrIrOr64ZNdZaJtSdy4H&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHyperX-Alloy-Origins-Mechanical-Compatible%2Fdp%2FB08XBQ79MN%3F\">HyperX Alloy Origins 60</a> is a mechanical deck on a metal baseboard. The downside is that it's heavier than the other options on the market, so it might not be the best if you\u2019re aiming to keep your travel bag as light as possible. But if you\u2019re a particularly rough typist this is the one with the build quality that will best hold up against hard keystrokes. It also earns points for being the one 60 percent keyboard that puts the secondary arrow functions at the bottom right of the deck where you\u2019d normally look for those, instead of tucking them away in the middle.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Solidly built; lower price point than other 60 percent options; well-placed arrow keys.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Heavy; no wireless.</p><h2>The best with arrow keys: Razer BlackWidow V3 Mini HyperSpeed</h2><p></p><p>Razer\u2019s BlackWidow line has long been a favorite of the gamers here at Engadget, and the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDkzNUhXTDFaP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTN6LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhNDA4NmZlMC0yNDE3LTRjM2QtYjljZS05OWQ2ODBkYjhhMzQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAaSRr73v4rlDAg_JTA10veFVUrbD7lYBFGyu9dQ9hBxo&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0935HWL1Z%3F\">V3 Mini</a> is no exception. Unlike the other keyboards on this list it\u2019s a 65 percent keyboard, which means it still has arrow keys and a column of miscellaneous keys on the right side that can double as macro buttons. There are two switch types available to suit different typing preferences, either clicky and tactile (green) or linear and silent (yellow). It\u2019s worth noting that the latter description is the company\u2019s term for it, and the V3 Mini\u2019s typing is still noticeably audible to those around you.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Two types of key switches available; has both 2.4G and Bluetooth connectivity; includes keys other keyboards don\u2019t have.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Expensive; the lip at the bottom is bulky.</p><h2>A cheaper but underwhelming option: Corsair K65 RGB Mini</h2><p></p><p>Corsair usually makes pretty great keyboards, but I couldn\u2019t necessarily say that of the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Db3JzYWlyLUN1c3RvbWl6YWJsZS1CYWNrbGlnaHRpbmctS2V5c3dpdGNoZXMtSHlwZXItUHJvY2Vzc2luZy9kcC9CMDhXMkNTWExNP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTN6LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhNDA4NmZlMC0yNDE3LTRjM2QtYjljZS05OWQ2ODBkYjhhMzQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQaBQBrac9GcaZAGN3NTsHHUA1Iszx0swDTz23WHJ1p-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCorsair-Customizable-Backlighting-Keyswitches-Hyper-Processing%2Fdp%2FB08W2CSXLM\">K65 RGB Mini</a>, its entry into the 60 percent market. The materials and overall durability were substandard for the company, with a plastic casing that felt hollow and keys that made a ringing noise when hit. But it\u2019s not a completely terrible accessory, and users already invested in Corsair\u2019s iCUE software might want to keep their accessories streamlined under one customization suite instead of having to bounce between different interfaces.

The team has published a paper in <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf3974\"><em>Science</em></a> for the technique dubbed CATCH, or cellular assay for targeted, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/crispr-gene-editing-blood-injection-213815705.html\">CRISPR</a>-discriminated horizontal gene transfer. For their lab experiments, the scientists used a species of bacterium called Acinetobacter baylyi. This bacterium has the ability to naturally take up free-floating DNA from its surroundings and then integrate it into its own genome, allowing it to produce new protein for growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What the scientists did was engineer A. baylyi bacteria so that they'd contain long sequences of DNA mirroring the DNA found in human cancer cells. These sequences serve as some sort of one-half of a zipper that locks on to captured cancer DNA. For their tests, the scientists focus on the mutated KRAS gene that's commonly found in colorectal tumors. If an A. baylyi bacterium finds a mutated DNA and integrates it into its genome, a linked antibiotic resistance gene also gets activated. That's what the team used to confirm the presence of cancer cells: After all, only bacteria with active antibiotic resistance could grow on culture plates filled with antibiotics.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>While the scientists were successfully able to detect tumor DNA in mice injected with colorectal cancer cells in the lab, the technology is still not ready to be used for actual diagnosis. The team said it's still working on the next steps, including improving the technique's efficiency and evaluating how it performs compared to other diagnostic tests. &quot;The most exciting aspect of cellular healthcare, however, is not in the mere detection of disease. A laboratory can do that,&quot; Dan Worthley, one of the study's authors, wrote in <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/genetically-engineered-bacteria-can-detect-cancer-cells-in-a-world-first-experiment-211201\"><em>The Conversation</em></a>.

However, commissioner Genevieve Shiroma voted against it, arguing that the CPUC didn't have sufficient information needed to be able to accurately evaluate the impact of autonomous vehicles on first responders. Their decision was the final hurdle the companies had to face to offer 24/7 fared rides across the city. It came after listening to public concerns about the safety of autonomous vehicles and to testimonies about how the technology could help the elderly and people with disabilities be more independent.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/waymo-and-cruise-get-approval-to-offer-247-paid-robotaxi-rides-in-san-francisco-050152855.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/waymo-and-cruise-get-approval-to-offer-247-paid-robotaxi-rides-in-san-francisco-050152855.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-08-11T05:01:52+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}]
