On today's IGN The Fix: Entertainment:
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse fans are unhappy about the changes made to the movie for its digital release, including the omission of one of the best lines teased in multiple trailers. Despite Gal Gadot's recent comments that a third Wonder Woman movie was coming under James Gunn and Peter Safran's re-vamped DCU, Variety reports today that that's not the case after all. Finally, Pedro Pascal turned up to see an art exhibition dedicated to the Hollywood superstar only to find out the gallery was closed on the day of his visit.

## Moving Out 2 Review

Moving Out 2 reviewed by Tristan Ogilvie on Nintendo Switch. Also available on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.

"Moving Out 2 is an extremely colourful and calamitous co-op sequel that’s as challenging as it is charming, serving up an enjoyably distinct set of crazy cargo collections that task you with bending at the knees while consistently splitting your sides. Spreading its preposterous brand of pass the parcel across multiple dimensions has empowered the developers to get really creative with the setup of each stage, and the addition of online multiplayer should mean that more players will be able to rope in a moving buddy whether they share the same couch or not. If you’re up for another hectic house party with friends, Moving Out 2 hits harder than a thrown fridge."

Stray Gods: The Role Playing Musical reviewed by Shannon Liao on PC. Also available on Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch.
Stray Gods’ musical murder mystery is definitely worth a playthrough or two. You can tell when playing it that it’s been a labor of love from a team that appreciates musical theater, complete with unique artistic choices, crafted songs that shift based on your choices, and characters loaded with emotional angst. The gods are grappling with how they fit into the modern world and with life’s traumas, just as many of us (and I imagine the writers) are. But the overall predictability of the story and of these well-known Greek myths limit how replayable Stray Gods ultimately feels.

Atomic Heart: Annihilation Instinct DLC reviewed by Luke Reilly on Xbox Series X. Also available on Xbox One, PlayStation, and PC.

"Atomic Heart: Annihilation Instinct still includes the same level of excellent and highly imaginative enemy designs of the main game, plus fabulous new environments, but its linear approach and weirdly limited arsenal is a step down from where we left off. That makes it a slightly confusing launchpad for the planned series of DLC expansions when it comes to tying up the loose ends Atomic Heart left behind back in February. But still, it’s nice to see NORA the horny fridge again."

Picking up a few months after the end of “Vacation Friends,” this uproarious sequel finds newly married couple Marcus (Howery) and Emily (Orji) inviting their uninhibited besties Ron (Cena) and Kyla (Hagner), who are also newly married and have a baby, to join them for a vacation when Marcus lands an all-expenses-paid trip to a Caribbean resort. His reason for traveling there in the first place is to meet with the owners of the resort to bid on a construction contract for a hotel they own in Chicago. But when Kyla’s incarcerated father Reese (Buscemi) is released from San Quentin and shows up at the resort unannounced at the worst possible moment, things get out of control, upending Marcus’ best laid plans and turning the vacation friends’ perfect trip into total chaos.
