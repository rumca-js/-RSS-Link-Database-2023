The 15" MacBook Air is nearly perfect—but that doesn't mean it's my recommendation for many—perhaps even most...

I’ve been using the 15” MacBook Air as my every-day laptop for over a month and I think this is the closest Apple has ever gotten to the perfect laptop—but that doesn’t mean I'm going to keep using it; nor should you should rush out to buy one. Lemme cook here. Since the MacBook Air debuted 15-years-ago, it hasn't been offered in a size greater than 13". For a few years there, we had an even smaller version available at 11.6", but never larger than 13 and it... never made sense. The simple reality is that a lot of people want big screens: be it aging eyesight, larger workspace requirements, laptop-only workflows, whatever... and until last month, the only way to get an Apple laptop larger than 14" in size was to spend at least $2,500 for a 16" MacBook Pro that is hulkingly overkill for many that merely seek more display real estate. The option is great for those that need it, but I think more people believe themselves to need it than those that actually do.
