The cause of the fires has not been determined but they broke out as the island faced strong winds and low humidity that the National Weather Service had predicted would bring high fire danger with the risk of rapid spread.</p><p><strong>What have </strong><strong>witnesses </strong><strong>said? </strong>Survivors spoke of a scene of devastation in Lahaina, a historic tourist spot, and recounted close calls as the flames reduced part of the town to ruins and took the lives of at least three dozen of their neighbors. “Lahaina Town and whole neighborhoods went up in flames and is unrecognizable … <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/10/hawaii-lahaina-maui-wildfire-survivors">it looks more like a war zone</a>,” Dean Rickard, co-coach of the Lahainaluna high school football team, told the Star-Advertiser in Honolulu.</p><p><strong>What does Thomas say?</strong> He denies wrongdoing, claiming he never discussed politics or business before the court with his benefactors, and to have been wrongly advised about disclosure requirements. Nonetheless, condemnation was widespread.</p><p><strong>What might happen?</strong> Robert Reich, a former US labor secretary now a Berkeley professor and Guardian columnist, said Thomas “must resign or be impeached if [the supreme court] is going to retain any credibility”. Only one justice, Samuel Chase, has been impeached – in 1804 – and he was acquitted in the Senate. In 1969, the justice Abe Fortas resigned under threat of impeachment, over his acceptance of outside fees.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/11/first-thing-hawaii-fires-made-much-more-dangerous-by-climate-crisis">Continue reading...</a>
