<p>When Zoom amended its terms of service earlier this month — a bid to make executives comfortable that it wouldn’t use Zoom data to train generative AI models — it quickly stirred up a hornet's nest. So the company “revised” the terms of service, and left in place ways it can still get full access to user data.</p><p>(<em>Computerworld</em> repeatedly reached out to Zoom without success to clarify what the changes really mean.)</p><p>Before I delve into the legalese — and Zoom’s weasel words to falsely suggest it was not doing what it obviously <i>was </i>doing — let me raise a more critical question: Is there anyone in the video-call business <i>not </i>doing this? Microsoft? Google? Those are two firms that never met a dataset that they didn’t love.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3704489/zoom-goes-for-a-blatant-genai-data-grab-enterprises-beware.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>I've gotta admit: I've really been struggling with how to share my experiences living with Google's line-blurring Pixel Tablet.</p><p>To say my expectations for this product were high would be an understatement. As I wrote in <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3684855/google-pixel-2023.html">a column this January</a>, it's been clear for a while now that Google's aim with the Pixel Tablet is to reimagine how we even <em>use</em> these types of devices and the very purposes they serve — to "create a whole new sort of framework for how tablets should function and fit into our lives," as a particularly sage mobile prophet <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3684855/google-pixel-2023.html#:~:text=With%20the%20Pixel%20Tablet%2C%20Google%27s%20aiming%20to%20really%20rethink%20how%20we%20alleged%20humans%20actually%20put%20those%20products%20to%20use%20and%20">once put it</a>.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3704488/google-pixel-tablet.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
