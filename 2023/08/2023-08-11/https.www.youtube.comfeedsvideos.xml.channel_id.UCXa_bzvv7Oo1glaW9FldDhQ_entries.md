Bethesda Game Studios' Starfield is one of the year's most anticipated games and promises an epic space-facing role-playing game unlike any we've seen before. As part of Constellation, players will traverse the universe, searching for alien artifacts.

There are over 1000 planets to explore, some teeming with alien creatures while others are desolate and lifeless. You'll discover multiple biomes, survey entire planets, frequent different cities, and maybe visit the Mission Board for some tasks. We've already seen the spaceship customization, character creation and more, but what else can we expect before launch?

Here are 15 things you should know about Starfield before its release. It launches on September 6th for Xbox Series X/S and PC and on day one for Game Pass.
