But this can be changed via the in-game settings.  The issue where the Gathering Legions event could stop after progressing even after defeating all nearby enemies has also been resolved.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">A series of Druid bugs have been fixed, too. They'll no longer have to worry about the Boulders cast with the Aspect of Metamorphic Stone equipped not dealing more than 100% damage. In addition, the Agitated Wind's malignant power will no longer trigger when breaking a destructible object, and the Aspect of the Alpha Werewolf companions will no longer float above the ground.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-patch-notes-address-bugs-for-druids-quests-and-more/1100-6516828/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-patch-notes-address-bugs-for-druids-quests-and-more/1100-6516828/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-08-11T22:32:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Mortal Kombat 1 Smoke, Ashrah, and Geras Breakdown | Kombat Kast 2023", "description": "<img height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1352/13527689/4177922-asdfdsafdsf.jpg\" width=\"480\" /> Learn more about Smoke, Ashrah, and Geras moves in Mortal Kombat 1.", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/videos/mortal-kombat-1-smoke-ashrah-and-geras-breakdown-kombat-kast-2023/2300-6462076/", "date_published": "2023-08-11T22:26:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Mortal Kombat 1 Smoke vs Li Mei High Level Gameplay", "description": "<img height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1352/13527689/4177921-capture-11august2023-10-56-39am.mp4.00_00_08_17.still002.jpg\" width=\"480\" /> Watch a high level developer match in Mortal Kombat 1 between Li Mei and Smoke from the latest Kombat Kast.", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/videos/mortal-kombat-1-smoke-vs-li-mei-high-level-gameplay/2300-6462075/", "date_published": "2023-08-11T22:19:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "THQ Nordic Digital Showcase Summer 2023", "description": "<img height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1352/13527689/4177920-opener.jpg\" width=\"480\" /> The curtains have closed on the exciting 2023 edition of our Digital Showcase!

The incubus' name is Haarlep, and you meet them in the devil's domain in Avernus. Here's what you need to do:</p><ul><li>Going to Raphael's domain is part of the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-free-orpheus-orphic-hammer-guide/1100-6516813/\"><strong>Free Orpheus</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-deal-with-the-devil-guide/1100-6516808/\"><strong>Deal With the Devil</strong></a> quests.
