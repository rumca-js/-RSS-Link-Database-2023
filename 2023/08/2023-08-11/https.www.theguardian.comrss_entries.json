Val, it turns out, has the backing of new legislation in Dallas. Nessa is effectively being forced to carry the dead baby to term, even though this jeopardises her own life from deadly infection, because it has the rights of a citizen, in law.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/11/blood-of-the-lamb-review-assembly-rooms-edinburgh\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/11/blood-of-the-lamb-review-assembly-rooms-edinburgh", "date_published": "2023-08-11T09:46:43+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Mary Earps warns Colombia \u2018the best is yet to come\u2019 from England at World Cup", "description": "<ul><li>\u2018Exciting time\u2019 to be with Lionesses, goalkeeper says</li><li>Colombia manager feels fans\u2019 backing will benefit his team</li></ul><p>Mary Earps has said \u201cthe best is yet to come\u201d from England as they prepare to face Colombia in front of a sold-out and overwhelmingly hostile crowd in Sydney on Saturday.</p><p>England have struggled to find form in Australia, with an impressive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/01/england-china-lauren-james-womens-world-cup-group-d-match-report\">6-1 defeat of China</a> the outlier, having laboured to 1-0 wins <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/22/england-haiti-womens-world-cup-match-report\">against Haiti</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/28/england-denmark-womens-world-cup-match-report\">and Denmark</a> and been taken to penalties <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/07/england-nigeria-womens-world-cup-match-report-lauren-james-red-card\">against Nigeria</a> in their last-16 tie.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/11/england-colombia-world-cup-mary-earps-best-is-yet-to-come\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/11/england-colombia-world-cup-mary-earps-best-is-yet-to-come", "date_published": "2023-08-11T09:42:55+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Ravaged orange crop in Florida raises fears of surge in US juice prices", "description": "<p>Extreme weather fuelled by climate crisis and bacterial disease have led to \u2018dramatic decline\u2019 in orange crops</p><p>Orange juice prices are expected to rise further in the US after a bacterial disease and extreme weather intensified by global heating ravaged this season\u2019s crop of the citrus fruit.</p><p>Last year Florida, which produces more than 90% of the US\u2019s orange juice supply, was hit by Hurricane Ian, Hurricane Nicole and freezing conditions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/feb/13/florida-orange-juice-record-prices-weather-disease\">in quick succession</a>, devastating orange producers in the Sunshine State.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/11/ravaged-orange-crop-in-florida-raises-fears-of-surge-in-us-juice-prices-aoe\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/11/ravaged-orange-crop-in-florida-raises-fears-of-surge-in-us-juice-prices-aoe", "date_published": "2023-08-11T09:39:13+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "And Just Like That \u2026 20 memorable looks \u2013 and what they tell us about fashion today", "description": "<p>Sex and the City brought us hundreds of iconic outfits, and its follow-up looks set to do the same \u2013 with a new tutu, repurposed wedding dress and vintage Ralph Lauren</p><p>The resin replica of a pigeon made by Irish designer JW Anderson, yours for \u00a3650, is a visual gag that speaks to fashion\u2019s love of a meme.

But Heart of Stone, as disposable and derivative as it might be, is a notable step up, playing a simple, sturdy game but playing it well, a surer hand gliding us through familiar territory. That hand belongs to British director Tom Harper, who cut his teeth on cinematic shows like Misfits and Peaky Blinders before impressing with crowd-pleasing music drama Wild Rose and baffling with Oscar-bait balloon adventure The Aeronauts. Together with his longtime cinematographer George Steel, he gives it both a sustained jolt of adrenaline and a sleek, glossy sheen often absent on Netflix, where too many washed out films look as if they were shot in murky rooms where someone had just been smoking.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/10/heart-of-stone-review-gal-gadot-netflix\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/10/heart-of-stone-review-gal-gadot-netflix", "date_published": "2023-08-11T01:00:22+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Spain v Netherlands: Women\u2019s World Cup 2023 quarter-final \u2013 live", "description": "<ul><li><a href=\"mailto:beau.dure.freelance@guardian.co.uk\">Email Beau</a> with your thoughts or tweet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/duresport\">@duresport</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/10/womens-world-cup-things-you-missed\">Ten things you may have missed at the World Cup</a></li></ul><p><strong>So, about those comments \u2026</strong></p><p>If you\u2019re a US fan currently watching the lengthy tribute to the older players on the US team, which is now running on Fox instead of analysis of a World Cup quarterfinal they\u2019ll be showing in 15 minutes, you may be looking for a team for which to cheer in this game.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2023/aug/10/spain-v-netherlands-womens-world-cup-2023-quarter-final-live\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2023/aug/10/spain-v-netherlands-womens-world-cup-2023-quarter-final-live", "date_published": "2023-08-11T00:50:18+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}]
