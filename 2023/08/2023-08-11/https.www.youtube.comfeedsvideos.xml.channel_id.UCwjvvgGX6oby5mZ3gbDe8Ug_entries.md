On August 4th, a second discharge followed. By this time, people got experienced and rushed to flee when they heard the news.
Legally speaking, when the Government's flood discharge causes damage to people's lives and properties, the people are entitled to compensation. Thus, in many cases, the CCP just doesn't send out any notifications. Without recognizing flood discharges, it can technically attribute all damages to natural disasters.
In the face of such a severe disaster, reports from the top  CCP media have claimed that it was caused by heavy rain, which means that the unannounced flood release from reservoirs doesn't exist.
