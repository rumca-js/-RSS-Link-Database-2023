<p>Merrick Garland’s announcement has failed to satisfy opponents of the president fully determined to uncover wrongdoing</p><p>The decision by the US attorney general, Merrick Garland, to appoint a special counsel in the investigation of Hunter Biden has rankled some of the same congressional Republicans who have demanded more scrutiny of the president’s son.</p><p>Republicans might have celebrated Garland’s announcement as a vindication of their dogged efforts to uncover wrongdoing in Hunter Biden’s overseas business dealings, which have become a central focus of their investigative work since regaining control of the House of Representatives in January. Instead, Republicans voiced doubt that the special counsel appointment would result in a fair investigation, and they took the opportunity to repeat their unfounded claims about Joe Biden’s allegedly corrupt financial activities with his son.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/11/why-hunter-biden-merrick-garland-special-counsel-investigation-republica">Continue reading...</a>

## Youthquake rumbles to a stop? Support for the left falls among New Zealand’s young voters

<p>Bucking global trends, polls find young voter support higher for National and right coalition than Labour as election nears</p><p>When New Zealand’s Labour party was elected in 2017, commentators heralded the “youthquake”. Jacinda Ardern had brought a dose of progressive energy and charisma to New Zealand politics – as well as a youthful face for Labour, and promises of transformative change. When the results rolled in, voter turnout was up across the board – but the biggest increases were among younger voters: <a href="https://elections.nz/media-and-news/2017/election-turnout-up-for-all-age-groups/">turnout rose</a> by 6.5% for 18- to 24-year-olds, and 5.5% among people aged 25-29.</p><p>Now, New Zealand could be seeing evidence of a move in the opposite direction, with indications that leftwing support among young people could be sinking – a result which, if it holds, would buck international trends. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/09/guardian-essential-poll-new-zealand-national-holds-clear-lead-over-labour-as-election-nears">Polling released this week in the inaugural Guardian Essential</a> poll found that among New Zealand’s 18- to 34-year-olds, just 20% were voting for Labour, the major centre-left party, compared with almost 40% supporting the centre-right National party. Support was not being distributed further left – the Labour-Greens coalition accounted for 34% of millennial votes, compared with a National-Act coalition sitting at close to 50%.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/12/youthquake-rumbles-to-a-stop-support-for-the-left-falls-among-new-zealands-young-voters">Continue reading...</a>

## Ligue 1 returns with fewer teams, more quality and plenty of drama

<p>PSG are title favourites – even if Mbappé and Neymar leave – but good luck predicting where the other 17 clubs will finish</p><p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/ericdevin_">Eric Devin</a> for <a href="http://www.getfootballnewsfrance.com/">Get French Football News</a></p><p>It’s the dawn of another season in Ligue 1 and, despite the overall quality of the league continuing to increase, the leitmotif before the campaign is uncertainty. This is the league’s first season with 18 teams, so the campaign will feel like less of a slog and performance levels should improve. Metz and Le Havre have returned – the latter after a long spell away from the top flight – and should be positive additions, but a dizzyingly busy summer window seems to have split the league roughly in half: teams who have a realistic chance of qualifying for Europe and those who would be happy to survive.</p><p>We should start with the obvious, the putative champions, Paris Saint-Germain. Kylian Mbappé’s contract situation hangs like an albatross over the club, as do rumblings of a potential sale of Neymar. That said, the club’s transfer business has been consistent with last summer: they have targeted young but experienced players and built intelligently rather than splashing the cash on attacking talent.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/11/ligue-1-prepares-slimmed-down-exciting-unpredictable-season-psg-neymar-mbappe">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Actor Andy Serkis narrates the posthumously published prelude to Tolkien’s epic masterpiece – a dense yet rich compendium of meticulously crafted lore</p><p>The origin story of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, The Silmarillion is drawn from a collection of manuscripts written over several decades by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/jrrtolkien" title="">JRR Tolkien</a>, and published posthumously by his son Christopher Tolkien in 1977 with the help of the fantasy author Guy Gavriel Kay. The foreword, written by Tolkien Jr, explains how outlines of these stories existed “in battered notebooks extending back to 1917 … often hastily pencilled”, and how the task of collating and editing them was “so complex, so pervasive and so many-layered that a final and definitive version seemed unattainable”.</p><p>The stories include the legend of the creation of Eä, the world taking in Valinor, Beleriand, the island of Númenor and Middle-earth, and a history of events leading up to the First Age. In this era, Morgoth, the first Dark Lord, is at war with the High Elves, who are intent on recovering the Silmarils, three gemstones stolen by Morgoth that contain the light that illuminates Middle-earth.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/11/the-silmarillion-by-jrr-tolkien-audiobook-review-the-lord-of-the-rings-andy-serkis">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Pi Recordings)</strong><br />Standard-song jazz interpretations by this group, helmed by drummer, composer and improviser Sorey, just don’t sound like anybody else’s</p><p>When the pandemic drove the MacArthur award-winning African American drummer and composer/improviser <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/01/arts/music/tyshawn-sorey-music.html">Tyshawn Sorey</a> online, he unveiled an astonishing diversity of new works – including violin and cello concertos, string quartets, live-streamed improvisations with chamber orchestra <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/sep/25/a-rhythmia-alarm-will-sound-pierson">Alarm Will Sound</a>. He also recorded a genre-hopping run of albums, of which this latest set by his trio with pianist Aaron Diehl and bassist Matt Brewer – covering original jazz themes by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/02/wayne-shorter-obituary">Wayne Shorter</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/17/ahmad-jamal-obituary">Ahmad Jamal</a> and others – is a startling standout.</p><p>Sorey doesn’t much care about where the crossovers between improvised and composed music begin and end. A gifted state-educated music student (collaborators have noted his ability for memorising complex notation on sight), he switched from classical trombone to jazz drums at college, soon bent the tradition his own ways and by 2003 was accompanying star leaders such as pianist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/apr/23/vijay-iyer-linda-may-han-oh-tyshawn-sorey-uneasy-review">Vijay Iyer</a>. But avant-jazz restructuralists Anthony Braxton and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/feb/04/butch-morris">Butch Morris</a>, and the sound-centred, time-bending patience of contemporary-classical composer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2012/nov/12/morton-feldman-contemporary-music-guide">Morton Feldman</a>, were as important to him as the regular jazz tradition. That’s why standard-song jazz interpretations by Sorey’s trio don’t sound like anybody else’s.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/11/tyshawn-sorey-trio-continuing-review-genre-hopping-triumph">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Australia coach has stayed true to his word by rewarding form regardless of age or status in his 33-man squad for the tournament in France</p><p>Ruthless and risky, maybe even slightly deranged. The Wallabies 2023 World Cup squad, announced on Thursday night for the “smash and grab” mission on rugby’s greatest prize starting next month in France, shows all the diverse moods of its maverick head coach Eddie Jones.</p><p>Foremost is the ruthlessness. Six weeks after being named co-captain of Jones’s team, 125-Test talisman and spiritual leader Michael Hooper, 31, has been denied a farewell tour in France after failing to recover from a calf niggle. Similarly, flawed genius fly-half Quade Cooper, 35, has been cast back into the wilderness after two dud starts and a fumble from the bench that let the All Blacks kick to victory in last week’s Bledisloe Cup match. And after poor Tests in July, fullback Tom Wright and flanker Jed Holloway have been dumped.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/aug/11/rugby-world-cup-2023-wallabies-squad-team-lineup-eddie-jones">Continue reading...</a>
