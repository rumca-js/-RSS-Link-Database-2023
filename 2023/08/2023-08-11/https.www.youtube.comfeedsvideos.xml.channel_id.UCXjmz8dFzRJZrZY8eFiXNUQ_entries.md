The Flash has been one of DC Comics fan favorite superheroes since his inception in the 1940's.  Though after countless comic books, tv shows, and cameos, it seems a truly great movie surrounding The Flash never got any traction.  Hope's were high for Ezra Millers feature length The Flash film, but upon it's release it seems the DCU still has a long way to go in order to make a truly great Flash movie.
