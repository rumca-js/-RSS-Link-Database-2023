  <p id="zEkAU7">Sony has been rumored to be working on a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/19/23361399/sony-playstation-5-redesign-detachable-disc-drive">revision of the PlayStation 5</a>, often referred to as the PS5 Slim, that includes a removable disc drive. Now images and a video have leaked of a PS5 model that looks slimmer and slightly shorter, and may well have a removable disc drive.</p>
<p id="h5hFUb">The first image leaked of the rumored PS5 Slim in a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/11/23828460/who-can-say-that-this-isnt-a-ps5-slim">Chinese forum earlier today</a>, and now a leaked video provides a better look at this rumored device. The video, from <a href="https://twitter.com/BwE_Dev">Better Way Electronics</a>, an Australian PlayStation repair specialist, shows off the plastic case of a potential future model of the PS5. It has a bulge for the disc drive, a curve in the middle with a smaller space for vents, two slits on each side of the case, and dual USB-C ports on the front instead...</p>

Both products will reportedly be branded under a new “QuietComfort Ultra” name when they ship in the coming months. The QuietComfort Ultra headphones look like a mashup of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review">Noise Canceling Headphones 700</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22698629/bose-quietcomfort-qc-45-headphones-review">QuietComfort 45</a>; they lean more heavily on the latter’s overall design, but you can see some premium upgrades to the headband and ear pads. </p>
<p id="ESLsHn">The $400 Noise Canceling Headphones 700 were announced back in 2019. Technically, they’re still the company’s top-of-the-line product, so the timing is about right for a sequel.

  <p id="BNLnZ7">A new Instagram feature allows users to add music to their grid posts — and Olivia Rodrigo is the first person to do it.</p>
<p id="TTFObH">The feature was introduced today by Rodrigo, who used it to unveil her new song, “bad idea right?” Instagram users can attach a song of their choice to soundtrack a carousel post with multiple photos or videos, similar to how tracks can be added to Stories or Reels. The feature appears to be in the process of rolling out to users.</p>

  <p id="zCzL3C">Waymo and Cruise were approved to operate their robotaxi services 24/7 in San Francisco after a contentious six-hour public hearing in which residents voiced their support and opposition to the vehicles. It’s a big win for autonomous vehicle operators, who have spent tens of billions on the technology with very little return. </p>
