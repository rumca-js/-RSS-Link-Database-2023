<p>Still a dedicated WinRar user? You need to update your software right now, especially if you&rsquo;ve got cryptocurrency. A zero-day vulnerability in WinRar has been allowing hackers to break into trading accounts, and they&rsquo;ve been actively working this exploit since April. The same vulnerability could be used to install other types of malware on your system as well,.</p>



<p>The way it works: You open a malicious zip file in WinRAR, which is your default program for all compressed file formats on your PC (after you&rsquo;ve installed WinRar, of course). It&rsquo;s full of seemingly innocent documents&mdash;PDFs, text files, JPG images. You double click on one to open it, which it does. But unbeknownst to you, WinRAR was also tricked into loading a script in the background, which installs malware that lets attackers steal money from brokerage accounts.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/winrar-zero-day-exploited-since-april-to-hack-trading-accounts/&amp;xcust=2-1-2040467-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Bleeping Computer</a>, WinRAR version 6.23 fixes this issue along with others, like a flaw that allows commands to be executed if you open certain kinds of rar files. (That is, rar files created in a specific way to exploit that flaw.) It released on August 2 and should be available to all WinRAR users.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="WinRAR malicious file download post on forum" class="wp-image-2040472" height="210" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/winrar-forum.webp" width="898" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">An example of the forum posts used to spread the malicious zip files.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Group-IB (via Bleeping Computer)</p></div>



<p>Cybersecurity company Group-IB <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.group-ib.com/blog/cve-2023-38831-winrar-zero-day/&amp;xcust=2-1-2040467-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">discovered this vulnerability</a> (filed as CVE-2023-38831) while tracking the spread of the DarkMe malware family, which has been linked previously to financial attacks. The tainted zip files, which were posted on forums for cryptocurrency and stock trading, contained DarkMe and other malware families like <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/detections/trojan-guloader&amp;xcust=2-1-2040467-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">GuLoader</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/detections/trojan-remcos&amp;xcust=2-1-2040467-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Remcos</a>. The latter two families allow more malware to be downloaded and installed on your PC, as well as giving the ability to run any command, record keystrokes, screen capture, manage files, and more to the attacker. (For deeper technical details, check out Bleeping Computer&rsquo;s rundown of the exploit.)</p>



<p>At the time of Group-IB&rsquo;s report, 130 traders have been confirmed as infected. The zip files were shared on at least eight forums, all under the guise of helping others improve their income. Currently, the full victim count and amount of financial damages are not yet known.</p>



<p>If nothing else, this WinRAR attack is yet another reminder that the old security tip of never downloading strange files off the internet (much less opening) them still remains true. It can also be seen as more incentive to upgrade to Windows 11, which will soon <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1929635/windows-finally-gets-native-rar-and-7-zip-support.html">natively support</a> compressed file formats like rar, 7-Zip, and gz&mdash;no need for third-party software.</p>

<p>By default, the Camera app in Windows saves photos and videos in the folder &ldquo;C: User[User name] PicturesOwn recordings.&rdquo; If there is little space left on drive C: or if you simply prefer a different drive, you can change this path. Go to <em>Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage &gt; Advanced storage settings &gt; Where new content is saved</em>. Set the desired drive under <em>New photos and videos will save to:</em> and click on <em>Apply</em>. New pictures will then appear in the folder &ldquo;[username]PicturesCamera Roll.&rdquo; </p>



<p>Another possibility is to move the entire default folder. To do this, right-click on<em> Pictures &gt; Properties</em>, then select the <em>Location</em> tab, and <em>Move</em>. Next, set the desired storage location and click on <em>Select folder</em>. Confirm with <em>OK</em> and answer the security question with <em>Yes</em>. Windows will now also move all existing pictures and videos to the new folder.</p>

## Asus’ swanky new OLED monitors are just what I’ve been waiting for

<p>Are you tired of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2027434/aoc-joins-the-club-with-another-1000-27-inch-oled-monitor.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">seeing the same 27-inch, $1,000 OLED panel</a> being trotted around by half a dozen different brands? Probably not because you&rsquo;re not a technology news writer who has to pore over nearly identical specification lists to find anything slightly different, but I digress. Asus has three new OLED monitors for gamers to drool over, and none of them are 27 inches. They&rsquo;re all quite a bit bigger&hellip;and probably a lot more expensive. They were announced at the Gamescom event in Germany. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Swift OLED PG32UCDM monitor" class="wp-image-2040223" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ROG-Swift-OLED-PG32UCDM_2.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Asus</p></div>



<p>First up is the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://press.asus.com/news/asus-rog-never-stop-gaming-event-gamescom-2023/&amp;xcust=2-1-2040159-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ROG Swift PG32UCDM</a>, a 32-inch 4K monitor. It&rsquo;s perhaps the most conventional design of the bunch &mdash; it&rsquo;s relatively large by monitor standards, but sticks to the usual 16:9 aspect ratio. 240Hz and .03 millisecond response time give it some serious gaming chops, but there&rsquo;s plenty of new tech specific to that vibrant QD-OLED panel. At 1,000 nits, it&rsquo;s considerably brighter than some alternatives and a custom heat sink and graphene layer protect it from heat and reduces the risk of burn-in. The USB Type-C port includes power delivery and an integrated KVM switch. Asus plans to get this one on the shelf in the first quarter of 2024, no price announced as of yet. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Swift OLED PG34WCDM monitor" class="wp-image-2040225" height="930" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ROG-Swift-OLED-PG34WCDM-_L.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Asus</p></div>



<p>Those who like their widescreens a little more <em>ultra</em> will want to check out the ROG Swift PG34WCDM, a 34-inch, 3440&times;1440 version of the design with an 800R curve rating. This wider monitor gets official Nvidia G-sync compatibility, an even brighter 1,300 nit rating, and 90 watts of USB-C power delivery. It&rsquo;s a closer competitor to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1440675/alienware-aw3423dwf-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Alienware&rsquo;s popular 34-inch OLEDs</a>, but with faster refresh and more connection options, it might just pull ahead. Again, it&rsquo;s scheduled for a Q1 release with no price enumerated. </p>



<p>The big daddy of the new ROG line is the Swift PG49WCD (up in the header image), a massive 49-inch OLED panel that stretches the resolution to 5120&times;1440. So in size and res, it&rsquo;s basically two 24-inch 1440p panels side by side. It has a less dramatic 1800R curve rating, a slower 144Hz panel with no mention of G-sync, and the brightness steps back down to just 1,000 nits, but the rest of the features are preserved. This one&rsquo;s coming a lot sooner in October, for a price of $1,499. That&rsquo;s a lot, even for a monitor of this size, but for a gigantic OLED it&rsquo;s surprisingly affordable. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/search?q=samsung+49+inch+oled#gsc.tab=0&amp;gsc.q=samsung%2049%20inch%20oled&amp;gsc.page=1" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Compare it to the Samsung G95SC</a>, which has a faster refresh rate but costs $1,800 retail. </p>



<p>It&rsquo;s great to see OLED monitors spreading out into more form factors, and with the largest of the panels being cheaper than the competition, maybe we&rsquo;ll see some offerings at lower price points, too. In the meantime, check out <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/813301/best-gaming-monitors.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">PCWorld&rsquo;s roundup of the best gaming monitors</a>. </p>

## Best VPN for streaming Netflix 2023: Watch from wherever you are

<p>VPNs aren&rsquo;t just useful for increasing privacy and security, they can also be the most effective tool at bypassing region locks to access streaming content in different countries. The top VPN providers are now offering features such as streaming optimized servers and stealth VPN protocols to make sure you always have access to your favorite sites. With the right VPN, you don&rsquo;t need to play a cat-and-mouse game to access location restricted content from your streaming provider. That&rsquo;s why choosing your VPN carefully is essential while out of country. </p>



<p>Given the restrictions by services such as Netflix&rsquo;s towards VPNs, you need to choose a service that has active compatibility with that streaming site. Also, its a good idea to choose a VPN with good overall server spread so that if one server is down in the country you are trying to access, there are other options available as well. The PCWorld staff have thoroughly tested the top VPNs on the market to see how they fare at unblocking the top streaming sites and we&rsquo;ve curated our favorites in the list below.</p>



<p>We highly recommend that you use a VPN not only to access location restricted content, but also to provide one of the best possible upgrades to your online security. So, if you&rsquo;re looking to use your VPN for more than streaming, be sure to check out our comprehensive <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-apps-reviews-buying-advice.html">roundup of the best VPNs</a> in all categories. </p>



<p><em><strong>Updated 08/23/2023: </strong>Check out our latest review of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406999/tunnelbear-vpn-review-2.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">TunnelBear VPN</a>. It&rsquo;s easy-to-use interface and straightforward features make it a good option for newbies, but it lacks some advanced features that power users rely on.</em></p>

<p>For our money, the best option for streaming Netflix is NordVPN. From the start, it has been challenging the Netflix VPN ban. It&rsquo;s also had a goal of making all of its servers work with the streaming service. As of our latest review, Netflix works without a hitch on all servers tested. No matter which Netflix catalog you want, NordVPN promises to deliver it. </p>

<p>NordVPN has more than 5,000 servers and offers locations in 60 countries around the world. It also allows you to choose your specific server so that you can switch around if you need to if Netflix&rsquo;s ban hammer ever comes down.</p>

<p>In addition to top-notch speeds, and Netflix compatibility, NordVPN offers double-hop connections and Meshnet. NordVPN also uses the WireGuard protocol by default, though it has made some modifications to make WireGuard friendlier and more private for commercial VPN services and thus calls its protocol NordLynx.</p>

<p>For both download and upload speeds, NordVPN is inside our top 5 for best speeds overall, and with the company&rsquo;s success rate of averting bans, it should have no trouble streaming Netflix anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>If NordVPN isn&rsquo;t your style, our top VPN overall, ExpressVPN, is also an excellent choice. ExpressVPN offers more than 3,000 servers in 95 countries. It also promises that Netflix will work with every server it has, and ExpressVPN offers good speeds. Express is on the pricier side at nearly $100 per year, compared to $60 for Nord. But the app is easy to use, the speeds are excellent, and it offers some nice extras such as a private DNS service that lets you set up an Apple TV or console for watching U.S. streaming services overseas.</p>

<p>When using a VPN to stream Netflix or another service, having a large pool of servers to choose from is a huge benefit. This is because streaming services and VPN providers are in a constant cat and mouse game to try and restrict or maintain access. And if you want variety and options in the server locations from your VPN, then CyberGhost VPN has them in droves. It offers a staggering 9,000+ servers for users to connect to&mdash;more than twice as many as ExpressVPN. These servers aren&rsquo;t all concentrated in the U.S. or Europe either. They boast a server spread with 110 countries across all parts of the world. It even recommends optimized servers to users for various needs such as gaming, streaming, and torrenting. We did find that some of the servers were faster than others, with servers located in Europe having excellent speeds while servers in Asia not so much. But all-in-all, in our testing we found that the speeds were good enough to stream on any and all of their servers. </p>

<p>Additionally, CyberGhost an intuitive and easy-to-use Windows app with good functionality. It lacks some of the power user features that other VPNs on this list provide, but that shouldn&rsquo;t be a deal breaker if you&rsquo;re just looking to use the service to stream. Ultimately, CyberGhost is a straightforward and easy-to-use VPN service with an impressive number of server locations. If you travel a lot or just need access to a wide-ranging server spread, CyberGhost is worth consideration.</p>

<p>Surfshark is another VPN that hits our top 10 for speeds, reaching 61 percent of the base speed in our latest tests. This makes Surfshark plenty fast enough for Netflix streaming. Our testing also showed that Surfshark was able to not only unblock Netflix, but also any other major streaming service we tried&mdash;including Amazon Prime, HBO Max, Hulu, and more. It also comes with ad- and malware-blocking features, double-hop connections, and, surprisingly, it offers unlimited simultaneous device connections as opposed to the usual five-device limit with most VPNs. The Surfshark app for Windows is also easy to use and if you opt for a two-year subscription, the price is incredibly affordable as well.</p>

<p>Another good recommendation is ProtonVPN, which is available at a similar price to ExpressVPN. Unlike NordVPN, however, Netflix doesn&rsquo;t work on every single Netflix server. It works on a lot of the more than 1,500 servers, but not every single one. The one issue with Proton is that it can have trouble from time to time, where a stream will suddenly stop, especially if you&rsquo;re watching while you work on the same PC.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-does-netflix-block-vpns">Why does Netflix block VPNs?</h2>



<p>As we mentioned earlier, Netflix&rsquo;s big expansion into pretty much every country on earth back in 2016 meant it had to get tough on VPNs. While Netflix produces a lot of its own content that it can make available worldwide, the company also licenses a ton of content from traditional entertainment studios. </p>



<p>These third parties are still working on a system of global territory licensing. Under this system, Netflix gets a package of movies and TV shows from these companies that it can show in the U.S., but that aren&rsquo;t licensed to be shown by Netflix in, say, Europe. To keep those companies and their other international licensees happy, Netflix must enforce a block on VPNs to prevent people from getting content made available to Netflix subscribers in the UK, but not the U.S.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We are making progress in licensing content across the world,&rdquo; Netflix said in a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://about.netflix.com/en/news/evolving-proxy-detection-as-a-global-service&amp;xcust=2-1-618517-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">2016 blog post</a>. &ldquo;But we have a ways to go before we can offer people the same films and TV series everywhere.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Netflix isn&rsquo;t the only company that has to enforce these restrictions. Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, and others do it too. However, Netflix along with Hulu are easily the most active and effective at it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="buying-vpn-access-for-netflix-streaming">Buying VPN access for Netflix streaming</h2>



<p>We&rsquo;ve already covered this in brief, but let&rsquo;s quickly deal with what you should be looking for in a Netflix VPN. First, most people should not make speed the top consideration. The minimum recommended bandwidth for a 1080p Netflix stream is 5 megabits per second (Mbps). If you&rsquo;re streaming in 4K it&rsquo;s 15Mbps. That&rsquo;s nothing, and nearly all the top VPNs hit those speeds quite easily in most places.</p>



<p>Instead, the first consideration should be the basic promise of Netflix compatibility from a reputable company. That&rsquo;s the rub. Any old VPN can promise Netflix compatibility, but if there aren&rsquo;t a lot of reviews about the service it may not be the real deal. Stick to well-known VPN services if you can.</p>



<p>Next, you need to consider how many servers are available for the service&ndash;especially the number in your target country. If you want Netflix Australia and the VPN only has two Australian servers, that could be a problem. Most of the popular VPN services list their server networks online that show you how many servers are in each country. </p>



<p>Finally, make sure the VPN&rsquo;s desktop app (and don&rsquo;t forget about mobile) allows you to choose specific servers. Since this is a cat-and-mouse game you need a service with a number of servers in your desired Netflix country. That way if one server has been discovered by Netflix, it&rsquo;s possible the others are still working. Often, just switching servers is enough to keep watching, and sometimes even simply reconnecting to the same server is enough to fix streaming issues. That&rsquo;s the one word of warning we&rsquo;d offer to anyone looking to play the international Netflix game. You will have to get used to occasional interruptions. Sometimes this can mean access to U.S. Netflix from overseas is blocked on a particular VPN entirely, though this often only lasts a day or two. Slightly more frequent interruptions may happen, where the stream will just stop. The fix for this is often just switching servers.</p>



<p>Finally, after all of that, consider speeds. Speeds for countries in North America and Europe are usually solid in the major VPN services. Australia and Asia can vary wildly, however. Any of our recommendations in this article will give you the speeds you need in those areas of the world. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>



<p>We only test on days that the wired internet connection hits 80Mbps or more. During the daily test we measure the speeds of five different locations around the world, running the test three times in each location and taking the average speed of each country for the day, and then we average those speeds again to get an overall daily average. Our countries are typically, but not always, the U.S., UK, Germany, Australia, and Japan. </p>



<p>The daily test is run on three different days at three different times of the day. We then take each daily average, and then average them again to get an overall average. We then determine that overall average as a percentage of the original daily speed. </p>



<p>The reason we don&rsquo;t bother with printing hard numbers as a rule is that experiences in hard numbers can vary wildly. It all depends on the speed of your internet connection, the time of day, and even device types can have an impact. For that reason we feel that percentages, which can show how much speed you can expect to lose on a given service, is a more useful indicator.</p>



<p>Netflix is an excellent service, and while the company doesn&rsquo;t like you to use VPNs, we&rsquo;ve never heard of anyone being penalized because of it. Just choose your preferred VPN service wisely and you&rsquo;ll be good to go. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-a-vpn">What is a VPN?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>A VPN (Virtual private network) encrypts your internet traffic and disguises your identity while browsing the internet. When used for streaming Netflix, a VPN will reroute your traffic from your location outside the U.S. to their own server within the country masking your true location and allowing you to bypass Netflix&rsquo;s region locks.</p>



<p>Additionally, VPNs anonymize your internet traffic and keep your ISP from potentially snooping on your browsing.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="are-vpns-legal">Are VPNs legal?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Yes! In most countries, including the United States, using a VPN is legal. Some websites such as Netflix might try to block VPN connections due to their own personal restrictions, but they are still perfectly fine to use. Please note, while using a VPN is legal, some of the activities done <em>while using</em> a VPN might be illegal. Activities such as downloading pirated copyrighted content or accessing dark web markets are both illegal with and without a VPN.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="will-a-vpn-affect-my-internet-speeds">Will a VPN affect my internet speeds?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>In short, yes, a VPN can have an effect on your internet speeds. But nowadays it&rsquo;s the exception rather than the norm.</p>



<p>While connected to a VPN, your traffic is rerouted through the VPN provider&rsquo;s own servers. Depending on where these servers are located, it can add extra distance for your traffic to travel to and from, slowing your speeds down a bit. Also, VPNs encrypt your data which can lead to slower download and upload speeds due to the time it takes to encrypt and decrypt your data. This can have a more significant impact on speeds and it can affect everything from page load times to video buffering speeds. Thankfully, modern VPN providers have taken advantage of advances in encryption technology and server optimization to drastically reduce these impacts.</p>
</div>
</div></div>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="do-vpns-track-my-browsing-or-store-my-data">Do VPNs track my browsing or store my data?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>This is entirely up to the VPN provider you choose to use. There have been instances in the past of VPN providers collecting data on their users. However, these were mainly free VPN services with no explicit &ldquo;no-logging&rdquo; policies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When searching for a VPN, be careful to check the company&rsquo;s website for a &ldquo;no-logging&rdquo; policy, third-party trust verification, and trustworthy user reviews. Thankfully, most of the major paid VPNs have clearly stated &ldquo;no-logging&rdquo; policies, so it&rsquo;s typically best to stick with one of them if you have concerns.</p>

Sync isn&rsquo;t quite as good as Dropbox, but it&rsquo;ll do for most things.</p>
</div>


<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s cloud storage service is called OneDrive, and if you&rsquo;re running Windows 10 or 11, you&rsquo;ll have noticed that the company is very keen for you to use it. It would be easy to think that as a first-party program it would be best in class on Windows, but that&rsquo;s not necessarily the case. In the basic functions of syncing and sharing folders and files, Google Drive is almost as good, and Dropbox is still better on a technical level.</p>



<p>But OneDrive is good enough, and if you&rsquo;re one of the millions of people who want to use Microsoft Office, it&rsquo;s by far the most affordable option. In fact, if you subscribe to Office, OneDrive can basically be counted as part of the package.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="cheap-cheaper-onedrive">Cheap, cheaper, OneDrive</h2>



<p>Every OneDrive users gets 15 GB of free storage, while premium accounts that offer 100 GB and 1 TB of cloud storage costs $1.99 and $6.99 per month, respectively. That&rsquo;s excellent pricing. A family subscription to Microsoft 365 costs $9.99 per month and gives you up to six accounts, each with a terabyte of space. What&rsquo;s more, there&rsquo;s nothing to stop you from creating more than one account for yourself and using the extra accounts with third-party programs, such as backups. I personally have two accounts and use one solely for backing up my computer (I use the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://www.arqbackup.com&amp;xcust=2-1-2020882-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><strong><em>Arq Backup </em></strong></a>but it works just as well with <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.duplicati.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-2020882-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><strong><em>Duplicati </em></strong></a>or <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.duplicacy.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-2020882-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><strong><em>Duplicacy</em></strong></a>).</p>



<p>Should you still pay for Office, you get several terabytes of storage for free, or looking at it the other way round: For about the same price as the competitors, you get all of Office for free alongside Microsoft&rsquo;s cloud storage. Outstanding.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="smart-sync">Smart sync</h2>



<p>Similar to Dropbox but unlike Google Drive and the Windows version of iCloud Drive, OneDrive uses so-called block-level copying. This means that if you make changes to a large file, OneDrive only needs to upload the changed bits and not the whole file again. Depending on how you use your computer, this can make a big difference in sync speed &mdash; or hardly any.</p>



<p>OneDrive has a setting to hide and not sync selected folders to a drive, which is handy if you have a large folder on one computer that you don&rsquo;t need access to on another. Open OneDrive settings, select <strong><em>Account </em></strong>on the left and then <strong><em>Select folders </em></strong>to set which ones will be available in the OneDrive folder.</p>



<p>On top of that, OneDrive can also offload folders and individual files from your computer so that they are only stored in the cloud, but can be retrieved if you want to access the content. In Windows Explorer, you can see whether a folder or file is local or cloud-only via a small icon in the <strong><em>Status</em></strong>-column: Blue cloud for only in the cloud, green tick for also stored locally. Right-click and select <strong><em>Always keep on this drive </em></strong>or <strong><em>Free up space</em></strong> to choose whether or not to keep the item on your computer for offline access.</p>



<p>Right-clicking also brings up an OneDrive submenu where you&rsquo;ll find options for sharing, changing permissions, viewing version history and more. You can download older versions directly from the version history here and do not need to open OneDrive in the browser.</p>

## Corsair debuts a modular stand-up desk that transforms to fit your PC build

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>&ldquo;Gaming&rdquo; desks are more often flash than substance, furniture that focuses more on RGB lights or a massive mouse pad than the actual utility or ergonomics of office furniture. Corsair is looking to buck that trend with the Platform:6, a desk that features both powered stand-up functionality (my ruined spine says thanks!) and modular add-ons for all the gear your battlestation demands. The desk gets an official debut at Gamescom in Germany, but won&rsquo;t be ready to ship until the fourth quarter of this year. </p>



<p>In its default state, the Platform:6 (spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/23/23842681/corsair-platform-6-gaming-desk-height-adjust-cable-management-release-date-monitor-arm&amp;xcust=2-1-2040258-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Verge</a>) is a six-foot wide black laminate desk with a steel frame and no motors &mdash; pretty basic stuff. The first upgrades available are standing motors with the usual LCD controller plus a &ldquo;walnut-stained rubberwood&rdquo; for a more classy surface. The really interesting stuff comes from the add-ons. Corsair says that the desk features an &ldquo;expandable rail system,&rdquo; which can add rear shelves, a crossbar for directly mounting monitors and microphone stands, elevated speaker platforms, and even workshop-style pegboards for hanging gear or decorations. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Corsair Platform 6 desk with model" class="wp-image-2040303" height="576" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Platforn6_2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Corsair</p></div>



<p>The surface of the desk itself can be expanded by 30cm on either side with added wood and more pegboards can be bolted onto the lower frame for easy access to cables, headphones, or even 3D-printed whatchamacallits that you design yourself. A rear-mounted cable organizer is a natural addition, but speaking as a standing desk user of many years, it&rsquo;s odd that there&rsquo;s no way to mount a desktop PC below the desk for maximum surface area and clean cable management. </p>



<p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.corsair.com/us/en/s/platform6&amp;xcust=2-1-2040258-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Corsair&rsquo;s website</a> will feature an online configurator for choosing your upgrades and add-ons before the launch of the Platform:6 later this year. Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s no indication of how much the desk or its many additional options will cost. </p>

Newegg&rsquo;s currently selling the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/p/N82E16834156430&amp;xcust=2-1-2040108-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">MSI Katana 15 gaming laptop for $1,139</a>, which is a colossal $360 off of the original price. This machine comes loaded with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 GPU. That&rsquo;s more than enough juice to run most modern games on the High or Ultra graphics preset. This laptop also has 1TB of PCIe NVMe SSD storage, which is perfect for larger game libraries.</p>



<p>The MSI Katana 15 is rocking an Intel Core i7-126650H CPU, an Nvidia GeForce  RTX 4070 GPU, 17GB of DDR5 RAM, and 1TB of PCIe NVMe SSD storage. The 15.6-inch display features a resolution of 1920&times;1080 and a refresh rate of 144Hz. The high refresh rate is good for high intensity games in which every second matters. For connectivity options, you&rsquo;re getting one HDMI 2.1, one USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-C, two USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A, and one USB 2.0.  You won&rsquo;t have any problem hooking up to an external mouse or monitor, that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>



<p>This is a fantastic deal, but we don&rsquo;t expect it to last long. You better swoop in sooner rather than later.</p>

## Windows tools like Photos and Paint may get new AI powers

<p>The AI craze is in full swing in the technology industry, and Microsoft is no exception. After <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/search?q=copilot+windows#gsc.tab=0&amp;gsc.q=copilot%20windows&amp;gsc.page=1" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">debuting the &ldquo;Copilot&rdquo; system</a> in Windows 11 preview builds and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1507026/how-to-try-the-new-ai-powered-bing-search.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Bing&rsquo;s AI-powered search</a> and chat tools, recent rumors indicate that artificial intelligence may be integrated into more fundamental Windows programs. A recent report says that the company&rsquo;s software division is hard at work adding AI features to long-standing default apps like Paint, Photos, the Snipping Tool, and the Camera application. </p>



<p>According to an unconfirmed report from <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/microsoft-may-bring-ai-capabilities-to-apps-like-paint-and-photos-on-windows-11&amp;xcust=2-1-2040076-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Windows Central</a>, internal builds of these programs are starting to emerge with new capabilities, some of which require specialized hardware. A lot of them are playing catch-up to what&rsquo;s already available on some other platforms. For example, the Photos app is being imbued with the ability to identify specific objects and people, plus isolating them from the rest of the image. The Camera app and the Snipping Tool will get optical character recognition like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1062361/powertoys-update-adds-ocr-and-two-more-tools.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">a recent addition to the PowerToys suite</a>, which is something Google Lens on Android has been able to do for years. </p>



<p>The humble Paint app is also being augmented with AI powers, getting text-based image generation based on the Bing Image Creator system. This might be using local hardware plus a training model to create images or going fully online and letting Microsoft servers crunch the numbers. At this stage, it isn&rsquo;t clear exactly how much of the new tools will rely on local hardware (like discrete GPUs or custom chips added to Surface devices and similar designs), and how much will require an active connection in order to implement. </p>



<p>And, as usual, it&rsquo;s possible that all of this could be scrapped by the time the in-development builds of Windows 11 actually make it into the hands of users. If I had to guess, I&rsquo;d say that we&rsquo;ll see some of these features appear slowly in the Windows Insider program for more intensive testing, assuming it makes it out of the initial software stages. </p>

## How long does data last on a USB flash drive?

<p>The lifespan of data on a USB flash drive depends on many factors: Under ideal conditions, data should remain preserved on a high-quality USB stick for at least 10 years or even longer. But what exactly does that mean and under what conditions does this hold true? </p>



<p>USB sticks or flash drives store data using NAND flash memory, in the form of binary valuesd (zeros and ones) in memory cells. Interestingly, it is electrons trapped in a kind of &ldquo;floating gate&rdquo; that represent these values. But these electrons can &ldquo;leak&rdquo; over time. This causes the data to degrade because it becomes harder to read whether the charge state represents a one or a zero. </p>

For long-term archiving, they bring with them too many confounding variables. Tapes or optical discs are better alternatives.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Kingston</p></div>



<p>There are several factors that can influence the lifespan of data on a USB drive: The quality of the NAND flash memory plays a role, as does the general workmanship of the stick. Cheaper models usually also have a shorter lifespan. Another factor is the number of write cycles, which describes how often data can be written and deleted.</p>



<p>With an increasing number of write cycles, the probability of data deterioration increases. Extreme temperatures as well as unfavourable storage conditions such as high humidity or dust can also damage the lifespan of your data on the storage medium. If the stick is exposed to high temperatures for a long time, this can cause the electrons to &ldquo;leak&rdquo; faster, which can damage the data and lead to its loss. </p>

However, due to various conditions, the electrons can &ldquo;leak&rdquo; over time, which can lead to data loss.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG</p></div>



<p>All in all, this does not make a USB stick the ideal storage medium for long-term storage of important data &mdash; certainly not as the only method. You cannot avoid regular backups on other storage media. If you really want to back up data over a long period of time, you should use archival tapes or optical media.</p>



<p>And remember: It&rsquo;s never a good idea to store important data in just one place and on just one medium. Flash drives are best for nimble file transfers or for creating bootable media.</p>

<p>By the end of the year, end-to-end encryption will be switched on by default in Facebook Messenger, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://messengernews.fb.com/2023/08/22/expanding-testing-for-end-to-end-encryption-on-messenger/&amp;xcust=2-1-2039933-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Meta says</a>. That means Meta&rsquo;s servers won&rsquo;t be able to read your communications &mdash; only the sender and receiver can read end-to-end encrypted messages in plain text. Users have already been able to encrypt their chats via a setting in Messenger, but soon it will become standard for everyone.</p>



<p>Services like Meta-owned Whatsapp, Signal, and several other competitors already offer this type of encryption. Meta has been building and testing the feature for Messenger for a number of years and says that the transition has required major changes to its technical infrastructure.</p>



<p>The introduction of end-to-end encryption for all is an important measure, though it remains to be seen how it will play out with the EU&rsquo;s controversial Chat Control proposal lingering overhead. This would allow all digital communication in the EU to be monitored, including those that are fully encrypted. How and when this might be realized remains to be seen, however.</p>

<p>Lenovo&rsquo;s top-tier Slim Pro and Yoga laptops have come into their own in recent years, delivering top-notch performance alongside excellent design. The new Slim Pro 9i once again ups the ante for Lenovo&rsquo;s competitors, pairing a 14-core Intel processor with Nvidia RTX graphics and a Mini-LED display.&nbsp;Let&rsquo;s get into it.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="lenovo-slim-pro-9i-specs-and-features">Lenovo Slim Pro 9i: Specs and features</h2>



<p>The Lenovo Slim Pro 9i packs Intel&rsquo;s Core i7-13705H, a rare alternative to the Intel Core i7-13700H. The two processors share the same core count, clock speed, and maximum power draw. The Core i7-13705H lacks vPro, however, and it&rsquo;s physically smaller.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>CPU: Intel Core i7-13705H</li>



<li>Memory: 32GB LPDDR5 6400 MHz</li>



<li>Graphics/GPU: Nvidia RTX 4050</li>



<li>Display: 3072&times;1920 165Hz Mini-LED touchscreen</li>



<li>Storage: 1TB solid state drive</li>



<li>Webcam: 1440p with electronic privacy shutter</li>



<li>Connectivity: 1x USB-C 3.2, 1x Thunderbolt 4 / USB 4, 2x USB 3.2, 1x HDMI 2.1, 1x card reader, 1x 3.5mm combo audio jack&nbsp;</li>



<li>Networking: Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.1</li>



<li>Biometrics: Windows Hello facial recognition</li>



<li>Battery capacity: 75 watt-hour</li>



<li>Dimensions: 12.9 x 9.64 x 0.85 inches</li>



<li>Weight: 3.7 pounds</li>



<li>MSRP: $1,899.99</li>
</ul>



<p>Lenovo also delivers a Mini-LED display with an unusual 3072&times;1920 resolution. It&rsquo;s an alternative to the OLED displays that are common among competitors. The Mini-LED display quotes an extremely high maximum brightness of 1,200 nits in HDR, much higher than the 400 to 600 nits of typical LED and OLED displays.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="lenovo-slim-pro-9i-display-and-build-quality">Lenovo Slim Pro 9i: Display and build quality</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Slim Pro design" class="wp-image-2035571" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lenovo-slim-pro-9i-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>Lenovo&rsquo;s Slim Pro 9i retains the handsome, refined design common to high-end Lenovo laptops. Its metallic-gunmetal colorway and lack of obvious flair makes for a mundane first impression. Look closer, though, and the laptop&rsquo;s advantages become obvious. The use of rounded edges across the laptop&rsquo;s perimeter makes for a friendly, inviting feel. Material quality is excellent, as well. Both the lower and upper half feel sturdy in-hand.</p>



<p>The Slim Pro 9i is a bit thick, though, measuring up to 8.5 inches thick and nearly 13 inches wide. The Apple MacBook Pro 14, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1677692/lenovo-yoga-9i-review-2.html">Lenovo Yoga 9i</a>, Razer Blade 14, and<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2026099/acer-swift-x-14-review.html"> Acer Swift X 14 </a>are less voluminous. Lenovo keeps the Slim Pro 9i&rsquo;s weight in check, though, as it tips the scales at just 3.7 pounds. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, though: the Lenovo isn&rsquo;t massive and will fit in most backpacks and messenger bags without issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There&rsquo;s a couple design quirks to note. The Slim Pro 9i has a camera bump-out above the display which houses the 1440p webcam and IR camera. The laptop&rsquo;s display lid is also a tad thicker than usual (due to the Mini-LED display). Fortunately, neither quirk becomes an issue in day-to-day use.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="lenovo-slim-pro-9i-keyboard-trackpad">Lenovo Slim Pro 9i: Keyboard, trackpad</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Slim Pro keyboard" class="wp-image-2035573" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lenovo-slim-pro-9i-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>A comfortable keyboard greets anyone who uses the Lenovo Slim Pro 9i. It provides a spacious, conventional layout that feels immediately familiar. A numpad isn&rsquo;t included (which is typical for a 14-inch laptop), so the keyboard remains centered above the touchpad.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Keys activate with lengthy travel and a firm bottoming action that provides good tactile feedback. It&rsquo;s a quiet keyboard, too: personally, I prefer a bit more click, but your mileage may vary. The overall experience is superior to Apple&rsquo;s MacBook Pro 14 and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/395027/razer-blade-14-2021-review.html">Razer&rsquo;s Blade 14</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A girthy touchpad consumes much of the real estate below the keyboard&rsquo;s spacebar. It responds quickly to input and provides ample space for windows multi-touch gestures. The size of the touchpad meant my palms often partially rested on its surface, yet I had no issues with unintended mouse input. Apple&rsquo;s MacBook Pro touchpads remain the gold standard for laptops, but the Slim Pro 9i&rsquo;s touchpad is as good as it gets on Windows machines.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="lenovo-slim-pro-9i-display-audio">Lenovo Slim Pro 9i: Display, audio</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Slim Pro 9i hero" class="wp-image-2035553" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lenovo-slim-pro-9i-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>The Lenovo Slim Pro 9i&rsquo;s specifications are impressive, but its best feature is the one you&rsquo;ll see most often: the Mini-LED touchscreen. It delivers extraordinary performance that leaves OLED in the dust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let&rsquo;s talk luminance. The Slim Pro 9i can reach a peak brightness of 548 nits in SDR mode and an outlandish 1145 nits in HDR mode. That&rsquo;s a bit less than the claimed peak of 600 nits and 1,200 nits, respectively, but I&rsquo;m not going to complain. Razer&rsquo;s Blade 16 and Apple&rsquo;s MacBook Pro 14 and 16, which also have a Mini-LED display, are the only laptops that deliver comparable performance.</p>



<p>Brightness is useful when using the laptop in a bright room or in a setting where you might not have control over the lighting, like an airport lobby. However, the Slim Pro 9i&rsquo;s incredible brilliance is also useful in HDR games and movies. I was amazed by the detail and punch delivered in <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em>. The sun shone intensely over Maverick&rsquo;s shoulders and its reflections glittered through micro-scratches in the cockpit. OLED has its perks, but it can&rsquo;t hope to match the Slim Pro 9i&rsquo;s cinematic immersion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Slim Pro 9i does well in contrast. It achieves an infinite contrast ratio in HDR content, and in SDR when the display was used at a low level of brightness. This occurs because the Mini-LED display can achieve a perfect minimum brightness of zero nits when displaying dark content. The contrast ratio isn&rsquo;t infinite when SDR is viewed at a more reasonable 50 to 100 percent brightness, but still hits an impressive contrast ratio of 5070:1.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Color performance is good, too. The Slim Pro 9i can display 100 percent of sRGB, 97 percent of DCI-P3, and 87 percent of AdobeRGB, all with solid color accuracy. It does fall a tad behind OLED: the Acer Swift X 14&rsquo;s display hit 100 percent of DCI-P3 and 94 percent of AdobeRGB. Still, the Slim Pro 9i has a vivid, punchy picture.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sharpness is excellent, as the laptop&rsquo;s unusual 3072 x 1920 resolution packs almost 250 pixels per inch (a 27-inch 4K monitor has 163 pixels per inch). Motion clarity is good, too, thanks to the display&rsquo;s 165Hz refresh rate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Downsides? While the Mini-LED&rsquo;s HDR performance is great, it&rsquo;s only available when the laptop is plugged in. But even this isn&rsquo;t really a criticism, because the same is true of nearly all laptops that support HDR.</p>



<p>Lenovo supports the Slim Pro 9i&rsquo;s excellent visuals with beefy four-speaker audio. It includes significant bass that nicely fills in the low end. That, in turn, provides space for the mid and upper range, which avoids the muddy or metallic sound common to most laptops. Maximum volume is high, too, so the laptop can nicely fill an office with sound. I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s quite as good as Lenovo&rsquo;s Yoga 9i but it beats most 14-inch Windows laptops I&rsquo;ve tried recently, and stands toe-to-toe with Apple&rsquo;s MacBook Pro 14.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="lenovo-slim-pro-9i-webcam-microphone-biometrics">Lenovo Slim Pro 9i: Webcam, microphone, biometrics</h2>



<p>Lenovo goes all-in on the webcam. It has a maximum resolution of 1440p and includes an IR sensor for compatibility with Windows Hello facial recognition login (a fingerprint reader isn&rsquo;t available). The webcam&rsquo;s high resolution delivers an extremely crisp image, especially in good lighting, and color reproduction appears natural in most situations. Image quality remains unimpressive in dim lighting, but that&rsquo;s true for all laptop webcams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Microphone quality is excellent, too, thanks to a four-microphone array that picks up clear, crisp dialogue and removes most quiet to moderate background noise. The microphone array was able to pick up my voice even when I moved my head from side to side or slightly aware from the laptop.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Slim Pro connectivity" class="wp-image-2035578" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lenovo-slim-pro-9i-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>As mentioned earlier, the Slim Pro 9i is a bit thick for a 14-inch laptop. It puts that thickness to good use with a mix of future-proof and legacy connectivity.</p>



<p>Modern devices can connect to the laptop&rsquo;s Thunderbolt 4 / USB4 port or the USB-C 3.2 port, both of which dot the laptop&rsquo;s left flank. Both ports support DisplayPort Alternate Mode and USB Power Delivery, as well, so they can be used to connect an external USB-C display or power the laptop with the included 140-watt power adapter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Older peripherals are handled by a pair of USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 ports on the right flank. An HDMI 2.1 port, SD card reader, and 3.5mm combo audio jack round out the options. It&rsquo;s an extremely strong selection that provides an advantage over competitors that focus solely on Thunderbolt 4 and USB-C.</p>



<p>Wireless connectivity is excellent, too, with support for Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.1. This is typical for most laptops sold in 2023, but good to see all the same.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="lenovo-slim-pro-9i-performance">Lenovo Slim Pro 9i: Performance</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1797659/lenovo-slim-pro-7-review.html">Lenovo Slim Pro 7</a>, which I reviewed earlier this year, was already a bit of a powerhouse for a 14-inch machine. Yet Lenovo ups the ante with the Slim Pro 9i, which packs an Intel Core i7-13705H processor that has a total of 14 cores (six performance cores and eight efficient cores). It upgrades from Nvidia RTX 3050 graphics to the new Nvidia RTX 4050, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These upgrades place the Slim Pro 9i alongside other 14-inch performance laptops, such as the Acer Swift X 14, but a tad behind the most powerful alternatives, like Razer&rsquo;s Blade 14.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Slim Pro PCMark 10" class="wp-image-2035580" height="734" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lenovo-slim-pro-9i-pcmark10.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>PCMark 10, a holistic system benchmark, puts the Lenovo Slim Pro 9i off to a strong start. It scored 6,864 combined, which defeats many laptops that provide similar hardware in a slim or small design. The Acer Swift X 14 and Lenovo Slim Pro 7 both lag behind. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1525530/samsung-galaxy-book3-ultra-review.html">Samsung&rsquo;s Galaxy Book3 Ultra</a> is top dog in this test, but it&rsquo;s a significantly larger laptop.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Slim Pro Cinebench" class="wp-image-2035582" height="751" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lenovo-slim-pro-9i-cinebenchr15.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>Cinebench R15, a multi-core CPU test, is less favorable to the Slim Pro 9i. It provides a reasonable score of 1,979 but lands quite far behind the Acer Swift X 14 and Samsung Galaxy Book 3 Ultra.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting result which underscores the difference between the Intel Core i7-13705H and the Core i7-13700H. They&rsquo;re extremely similar on paper, but they don&rsquo;t perform similarly in the real world. The Core i7-13705H is at a disadvantage here.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Slim Pro Handbrake" class="wp-image-2035585" height="740" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lenovo-slim-pro-9i-handbrake.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>Handbrake, another CPU-heavy benchmark, confirms that result. The Lenovo Slim Pro 9i is the slowest of all laptops used for comparison, falling behind even the AMD Ryzen 7735HS in the older Lenovo Slim Pro 7.</p>



<p>The Slim Pro 9i&rsquo;s CPU performance isn&rsquo;t bad, but it doesn&rsquo;t impress. In fact, it struggles to stand out even when compared to the AMD Ryzen 7735HS, a processor with fewer cores and a lower maximum clock speed. That&rsquo;s not a great result for Intel, which continues to look lackluster next to less power-hungry AMD Ryzen 7000-series processors.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Slim Pro 3DMark Time Spy" class="wp-image-2035589" height="752" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lenovo-slim-pro-9i-3dmark.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>Fortunately, the Slim Pro 9i has a secret weapon: the Nvidia RTX 4050 GPU.</p>



<p>The Nvidia RTX 4050 doesn&rsquo;t look intimidating on a spec sheet. It&rsquo;s Nvidia&rsquo;s least performant RTX 40-series GPU, after all. However, Lenovo provides an RTX 4050 with a maximum graphics power of 80 watts. That&rsquo;s a big improvement over competitors like the Acer Swift X 14, which limits the RTX 4050 to a maximum graphics power of 50 watts.</p>



<p>It shows in 3DMark Time Spy, where the Slim Pro 9i delivers a formidable score of 7,236. That&rsquo;s a more than 20 percent improvement over the Acer Swift X 14, and more than 35 percent quicker than the Slim Pro 7 with Nvidia RTX 4050.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Slim Pro Shadow of the Tomb Raider" class="wp-image-2035592" height="809" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lenovo-slim-pro-9i-shadow-of-the-tomb-raider.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>A similar improvement is found in <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em>, where the Slim Pro 9i provides another roughly 25 percent improvement over the Acer Aspire X 14. That puts the Slim Pro 9i at an impressive 100 frames per second at 1080p resolution and the game&rsquo;s Highest detail preset.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Slim Pro Metro Exodus" class="wp-image-2035594" height="738" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lenovo-slim-pro-9i-metro-exodus.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>The Slim Pro 9i continues to do well in <em>Metro Exodus</em>, which we tested at 1080p resolution and Extreme detail. Its lead is reduced to just a few frames, however, providing a far more narrow advantage than in <em>Tomb Raider</em>. Memory may be an issue: though it can consume more power, the Lenovo&rsquo;s RTX 4050 remains limited to 6GB of VRAM.</p>



<p>I wrapped up testing with <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, which offers an example of ray-traced performance in action. The game averaged 58 frames per second at 1080p resolution and Ultra detail (with AMD FSR 2.0 on). Switching on the ray-traced Ultra preset reduced that to just 16 frames per second, but Nvidia DLSS 3 lifted performance back to a playable 50 frames per second. It&rsquo;s also a tad better than the Acer Swift X 14, which achieved 46 frames per second in this scenario.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="lenovo-slim-pro-9i-battery-life">Lenovo Slim Pro 9i: Battery life</h2>



<p>The Slim Pro 9i packs a 75 watt-hour battery into its thick chassis. That&rsquo;s a reasonably large battery for most laptops, but the Slim Pro 9i&rsquo;s CPU and GPU put it to the test&mdash;and find it wanting.</p>



<p>Our standard battery life test, which loops a 4K file of the short film <em>Tears of Steel</em>, drained the battery in seven hours and 47 minutes. That&rsquo;s a usable result, and certainly better than the disappointing Acer Swift X 14.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, this result is unlikely to impress road warriors looking for all-day battery life. The older Slim Pro 7 was a better choice for marathon sessions and some larger laptops, like the Samsung Galaxy Book3 Ultra and Asus Vivobook Pro 16X OLED, outlast the Slim Pro 9i.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="lenovo-slim-pro-9i-should-you-buy-it">Lenovo Slim Pro 9i: Should you buy it?</h2>



<p>The Lenovo Slim Pro 9i is an impressive laptop with a brilliant Mini-LED display, a powerful 100-watt version of Nvidia RTX 4050 graphics, and excellent connectivity. Intel&rsquo;s Core i7-13705H lets the laptop down, as it fails to deliver a significant improvement over the less expensive Lenovo Slim Pro 7. That wound is worsened by the Slim Pro 9i&rsquo;s MSRP, which is higher than alternatives with superior CPU performance. Still, the Slim Pro 9i is an easy recommendation for those who care more about GPU than CPU performance. It&rsquo;s also a fantastic choice if you frequently view HDR movies and games on your laptop.&nbsp;</p>
