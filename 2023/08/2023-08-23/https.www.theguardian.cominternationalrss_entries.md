<p>Butter, bread, confit and a cheesy potato bake – all with ample allium. In these recipes by cook Daen Lia, more garlic is more</p><p>No matter what I serve this with, it always steals the show. I might have spent all day making pasta with a slow-cooked sauce, but it will go untouched if this garlic bread is on the dinner table. It’s also packed with mozzarella – when baked, the mozzarella melts into the bread and oozes out when pulled apart.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/aug/24/the-bulb-and-the-beautiful-four-show-stealing-recipes-with-lots-of-garlic">Continue reading...</a>

## Chelsea have started the season poorly but Sterling’s form offers hope

<p>Chelsea need experience, creativity and goals to ignite their season – and the forward could be the man to do it</p><p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/BenMcAleer1">Ben McAleer</a> for <a href="http://www.whoscored.com/">WhoScored</a></p><p>Given the number of incomings and outgoings at Chelsea over the last year, Raheem Sterling has become something of a forgotten man at Stamford Bridge. The 28-year-old only signed from Manchester City last summer but already feels like an old timer. Sterling, the first signing under the new owners, made his Chelsea debut last August in a 1-0 win against Everton. Just three of his 10 teammates from that game are still at the club: Thiago Silva, Reece James and Ben Chilwell.</p><p>Sterling had a disappointing first season at Chelsea, scoring just six times and providing three assists in the league. It’s no wonder he struggled given the spate of new additions, the increasingly bloated squad and the managerial upheaval at the club – he played under four different head coaches. Few players, if any, covered themselves in any real glory as Chelsea laboured to a 12th-placed finish and scored just 38 league goals – one per game, a scoring rate beaten by Erling Haaland. Even relegated pair Leicester and Leeds scored more.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/who-scored-blog/2023/aug/23/chelsea-have-started-the-season-poorly-but-sterlings-form-offers-hope">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The team won the AL East by seven games last year. This season a series of injuries and a lack of depth have hit them hard</p><p>An unsuccessful season for the New York Yankees typically means one where they don’t reach the World Series. No MLB team holds itself to higher standards, so it’s little wonder there’s a sense of despair in the Bronx as it becomes clear that the 2023 squad will miss out on the playoffs altogether. In fact, the Yankees are in danger of putting together their worst season in 30 years.</p><p>The Boston Red Sox came to Yankee Stadium last weekend with an opportunity to effectively end the postseason hopes of their archrivals. Time may be running out for the mediocre Red Sox to leapfrog the teams <a href="https://www.mlb.com/standings/wild-card">ahead of them in the Wild Card race</a>, but they came alive when given the chance to avenge the “Boston Massacre” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1978_Boston_Red_Sox_season#The_%22Boston_Massacre%22">of 1978</a> (<a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2006/08/22/yankees-five-game-sweep-leaves-devastation-fenway/ph3fxiWC1d6cHWfiou4bHP/story.html">or perhaps its 2006 reboot</a>).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/23/the-yankees-face-their-first-losing-season-in-30-years-things-may-get-worse">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I dragged this coat with me from house to house. After Mum died, anything she was a witness to became more valuable to me</p><p>Most things in our house have belonged to someone else.
