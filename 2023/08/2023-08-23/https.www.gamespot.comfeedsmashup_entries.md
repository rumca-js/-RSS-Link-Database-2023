## Your Thrawn Is In Another Galaxy: What Ahsoka's Quest Could Mean For The Star Wars Franchise

<p>If you aren't a Star Wars: Rebels fan, watching Ahsoka can be a little bit disorienting because it's essentially a live-action fifth season of that animated series. But there's still plenty for all the other Star Wars fans to chew on--particularly the search for Thrawn, which seems like it could be taking us beyond the borders of the Star Wars galaxy as we know them. It's kind of a big deal.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Warning: The rest of this article will contain major spoilers for the first two episodes of Ahsoka, as well as speculation about what could happen in the rest of the series.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">But it's not a big deal just because it's cool to do something new--though that <em>is</em> something Star Wars doesn't do often enough. It's a big deal because it means that this series might actually bring some order to the comically vague and nonsensical post-Return of the Jedi timeline that has been in complete shambles since Disney rebooted the continuity a decade ago.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/your-thrawn-is-in-another-galaxy-what-ahsokas-quest-could-mean-for-the-star-wars-franchise/1100-6517155/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Sylvester Stallone and Jason Statham are back to team up with a new group of mercenaries in the Expendables 4. And unlike the previous movie in the action series, this one will be rated R.</p><p dir="ltr">In fact, Lionsgate is really hammering home that Expendables 4 will be full of blood and guts. The red band trailer--seen below--for the upcoming action flick shows Statham slicing open up a guy's neck with a knife, a dude's head exploding after hitting a metal pole, and more explosions than you can count on one hand.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">The new Expendables 4 trailer also introduces the newcomers to the franchise, such as Curtis "50 Cent" Jackson, Megan Fox, Tony Jaa, Iko Uwais, and even Andy Gracia. Along with Stallone and Statham, returning players include Dolph Lungren and Randy Couture, who are known as Gunner Jenson and Toll Road in the franchise, respectively.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/expendables-4-red-band-trailer-is-all-about-blood-bullets-and-f-bombs/1100-6517144/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Samsung revealed the first dual UHD monitor, the Odyssey Neo G9, and it features a massive 57-inch screen. This monitor, as well as the 55-inch 2023 Odyssey Ark, are currently on display at Gamescom and will be available for purchase in October.</p><p>The 57-inch 32:9 is as wide as two 32-inch UHD monitors, a size that will envelop your eyeballs and monopolize your desk space. It features Quantum Matrix Technology, which allows for smaller, more distinct dimming areas. It refreshes at 240Hz and has a 1ms response time, which should offer a smooth experience with a ludicrously high frame rate. AMD FreeSync Premium Pro syncs the screen to prevent stuttering. Picture-in-Picture and Picture-by-Picture modes allow you to view multiple inputs on the monitor, and you can even switch inputs quickly with Auto Source Switch.</p><p>As for the new Odyssey Ark, it has 165Hz refresh rate and a 1ms GTG response time. The Ark can display up to four inputs on the screen at the same time with Samsung Multiview. It also includes a keyboard, video, mouse switch feature, which helps you use all the devices connected to the monitor with the same keyboard and mouse.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/samsung-unveils-absurdly-massive-57-inch-dual-uhd-monitor/1100-6517148/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon is the first game in the storied mech franchise in 10 years. Since 2013's Verdict Day, developer From Software has reached extraordinary heights of mainstream success and critical acclaim. How does the storied developer's return to mech action fair?</p><p>Reviews so far are positive, citing a wide variety of customization options, searingly difficult battles that require you to rethink your strategy, and fast-paced movement and action. The game's branching storyline did get some criticism, with some reviewers calling it clichÃ©d or confusing. GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/armored-core-6-fires-of-rubicon-review-mechlike/1900-6418109/">Armored Core 6: Fires Of Rubicon Review</a> gave it a 8/10. Reviewer Richard Wakeling said, "It's a game for the die-hards but also represents the most approachable game in the series thus far--one that sees From Software return to its roots in triumphant fashion."</p><p>On our sister site <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/armored-core-vi-fires-of-rubicon">Metacritic</a>, Armored Core 6 is currently at 88 for the PS5 version, an aggregate score drawing from 47 reviews. It sits at 87 on PC, based on 26 reviews. On Xbox Series X|S, it trails a little behind with a score of 78, based on seven reviews.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/review-roundup-for-armored-core-6-fires-of-rubicon/1100-6517152/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>After a rocky first season, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo IV</a> Season 2 is looking to incorporate many of the features fans have been asking about since before the game's launch, along the way introducing new mechanics for players to sink their teeth into. Called Season of Blood, the next step in Diablo IV's live-service journey debuted as part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamescom-opening-night-live-2023-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-4837/">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>, after which Blizzard shared additional details on what fans can expect come Season 2's launch in October. Here's everything we know about what's coming next to Diablo IV.</p><div><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a href="https://www.gamespot.com">hide</a>]</span><ul class="collapse in" id="toc_list"><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com">Diablo IV Season Of Blood Release Date</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com">Diablo IV Season Of Blood New Features And Content</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Diablo_IV_Season_Of_Blood_Release_Date">Diablo IV Season Of Blood Release Date</h2><p dir="ltr">Blizzard had previously said its goal was to release new Diablo IV seasons quarterly, and it looks to be sticking to that vision. Season 2 will start on October 17. That's also the same day the game's first season will end, meaning it doesn't look like there will be any break in between seasonal rollouts. Diablo IV's major Season 1 patch actually arrived a few days prior to Season of the Malignant's start date, letting players get their hands on class balance changes and quality-of-life improvements ahead of the arrival of new seasonal content. It's currently unclear if something similar will happen with Season 2, but Blizzard has pledged to release patch notes at least a week ahead of an update's release to give the community time to process all the changes.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Diablo_IV_Season_Of_Blood_New_Features_And_Content">Diablo IV Season Of Blood New Features And Content</h2><p dir="ltr">A new season means new gameplay mechanics, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-2-will-have-players-embracing-vampiric-powers/1100-6517115/">Season 2 will see players embracing vampiric powers</a> and teaming up with a vampire hunter to defeat the latest threat to Sanctuary. The new seasonal questline will introduce the vampire hunter Erys, voiced by actress Gemma Chan in her video game debut. Blizzard has not yet announced what those vampiric powers will look like or how players will unlock and equip them. Alongside a new questline, battle pass, and powers, Blizzard has confirmed that it will add five new endgame bosses. Blizzard has not yet disclosed what all those bosses will be, but said they will include "new and returning foes." A new way to target-farm for some of the game's most coveted Unique and Uber Unique items is also coming, though what exactly that will look like remains to be seen.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-2-start-date-and-everything-we-know-about-season-of-blood/1100-6517149/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Persona 3 Reload Gets February Release Date, New Gameplay Trailer Out Now

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/persona-3-reload/">Persona 3 Reload</a>, the remake of the cult-classic PlayStation 2 JRPG, is set to release on February 2, as revealed in a brand-new trailer that debuted during Gamescom 2023.</p><p dir="ltr">The remake, which was first announced earlier this year during the Xbox Showcase in June, is a full remake of the original PlayStation 2 title, omitting content that was then later added to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/shin-megami-tensei-persona-3-portable/">Persona 3 Portable </a>on PSP. This means that you'll be confined to playing as a male protagonist, and won't have the choice to choose a female protagonist that FES presented. The game is being remade in Unreal Engine and looks to be taking a lot of inspiration from the series' most recent entry, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/persona-5/">Persona 5</a>, and its larger <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/persona-5-royal/">Royal</a> version.</p><p dir="ltr">A huge aspect of Persona titles is the music, with Persona 3 arguably having the best of the lot. Some new music will accompany Reload, with the game's new battle theme titled "It's Going Down Now" debuting in the new trailer. One big change is the vocalist behind the new music, with Azumi Takahashi now accompanying the returning Lotus Juice.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/persona-3-reload-gets-february-release-date-new-gameplay-trailer-out-now/1100-6517151/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>SteamWorld Build will launch on December 1; it releases on Xbox Game Pass the same day. The city-builder is the the latest in the genre-eclectic series from Thunderful Development.</p><p>A new trailer, announcing the release date, shows off the game's town construction and mining operations, as well as flickers of its narrative. In order to build a rocket to a brighter world, you'll have to mine resources, construct buildings, fend off enemy monsters, and find ancient spaceship parts. The game is broadly split into two parts. You'll build out your town on the surface of the planet and dive below to oversee mining. On the surface, you will build housing, entertainment complexes, shops, and everything else your workers need to survive and thrive.</p><p>Below ground, you'll build out mining infrastructure like tunnels and break rooms. You can also construct armories and defense turrets to help your Steambots defend the mine from giant insects and carnivorous plants. As you clear ground, you will dig up ancient machinery to help you build your rocket to the stars.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steamworld-build-releases-in-december-gets-simultaneous-game-pass-launch/1100-6517141/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>EA's big RPG studio BioWare is cutting numerous jobs in what the studio is calling an "extremely difficult" but necessary move. In a <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2023/08/23/an-update-on-the-state-of-bioware/">blog post</a>, BioWare GM Gary McKay said the studio "must shift towards a more agile and more focused studio" so developers can work more efficiently, and layoffs will help the company get there. Alongside this, EA is reportedly no longer working with a group of playtsters for Dragon Age: Dreadwolf that voted to unionize in 2022.</p><p>"As part of this transition, we are eliminating approximately 50 roles at BioWare. That is deeply painful and humbling to write. We are doing everything we can to ensure the process is handled with empathy, respect, and clear communication," McKay said.</p><p>Affected staffers can apply for other positions within EA, but McKay said "it's unlikely everyone will find a new role within the company."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioware-announces-big-job-cuts-and-reportedly-parts-ways-with-unionized-dragon-age-testers/1100-6517145/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Speaking at Gamescom, Hines said players should be sure to be mindful of their activity log, because what might look like "throwaway" stuff could lead players to some interesting places.</p><p>"My one piece of advice to folks is do not ignore your activities. It feels like throwaway stuff that the game is giving you, but there's some amazing stuff in there that doesn't even feel like a real quest but will take you to some amazing places and some amazing stories," <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGlCHdfvqJQ">Hines said during an Xbox Gamescom livestream</a>. "We encourage you to play this like any BGS game, which is like do what you want, go where you want, test the game, be the kind of player, the kind of person you want to be in this world and see what happens."</p><p>Hines also mentioned how he hopes players will try to push Starfield to its limits and do whatever they want, whether that be the main storyline or anything else they want to spend their time with.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-the-most-important-starfield-advice-to-get-the-most-out-of-it-according-to-a-dev/1100-6517135/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Armored Core 6: Fires Of Rubicon Review - Mechlike

<p dir="ltr">Rubicon 3, the setting for Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon, is a far cry from the likes of Lordran and The Lands Between, immediately establishing a striking sci-fi aesthetic that's unlike anything From Software has created in the past decade. Lessons learned from the studio's most recent output are evident in Armored Core VI, but don't go in expecting this to be Dark Souls with mechs. The sixth numbered entry in the series is a decidedly Armored Core game, meshing exciting mech-on-mech action with the highly customizable assembly of your giant robot. It's a game for the die-hards but also represents the most approachable game in the series thus far--one that sees From Software return to its roots in triumphant fashion.</p><p dir="ltr">Though Rubicon 3 might be able to sustain human life, it's still an incredibly hostile place. Occupying corporations wage war against each other, local resistance fighters, and a governmental space force, for control of the planet and its valuable resources. Dilapidated cities, arid deserts, and frozen wastelands serve as the battlefields for mechanized warfare, as missiles, bullets, and laser cannons frequently collide with steel. Even the planet itself is imposing. Giant metallic structures stretch thousands of feet into the sky and then spread outwards like branches, each one carpeted in blinking lights that replace the stars they're obscuring. When you do catch a glimpse of the sky, you'll notice pockets of the planet's atmosphere burning red like fire.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">The reason Rubicon 3 is such a hotbed of action is because it's home to Coral. This mysterious substance is immensely valuable, causing a number of extraplanetary corporations to descend upon the planet in an all-out war to harness it. You enter the fray as an independent mercenary employed by the enigmatic Handler Walker, who orders you to complete jobs on behalf of whichever faction is willing to pay. Referred to only as 621 or your callsign, Raven, the story in Armored Core VI has an oddly impersonal feel. Much of the narrative is delivered through audio on a static screen, with nary a human face in sight. Being a silent protagonist also makes it difficult to escape the feeling that you're a puppet for those pulling the strings. This is seemingly intentional, although the story never quite delves deep enough into this feeling of detachment to say anything meaningful. Most of the characters are fairly cliched, even if the voice acting is generally entertaining, and while there are interesting aspects to the lore, the story is ultimately disappointing without ever being particularly bad.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/armored-core-6-fires-of-rubicon-review-mechlike/1900-6418109/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Goes Even Bigger And Bloodier

<p>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a game I've been clamoring for since playing as the stoic Captain Titus way back in September 2011. I was a Warhammer fan before Space Marine, and if anything, I'm an even bigger one now. The franchise has been an important part of my life and I wanted you, dear reader, to know this little context of myself and my relationship with Warhammer so when I tell you during my one-hour hands-on with Space Marine 2 I was grinning ear-to-ear, and my eyes were drying out due to them being locked on the Grimdark scenes unfolding before me, you may get a sense of just where I'm coming from as I share my thoughts fresh from playing a game I've thought about for almost 12 years.</p><p>While I wasn't able to record my own gameplay, it is clear from the snippet that I got to play that the developers at Saber are also fans themselves, with a drive to do Space Marine, its world, and the franchise justice, not just for long-time fans like myself, but for those new to Warhammer as well.</p><p>The first thing I noticed was Space Marine 2's attention to detail as the game opens up on Titus with his new squad on their way to support the Cadians on the planet's surface. I felt like the Once Upon A Time In Hollywood meme, pointing my fingers at the screen as I excitedly picked up on little details on Astartes armor or individual troops or tanks littered across the battlefield, but I believe it is with smart design and appreciation for the source that the game can also feel approachable to those with fresh eyes, too.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-goes-even-bigger-and-bloodier/1100-6517050/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Microsoft and mattress band Tempur have teamed up to create a gaming chair themed around Starfield, and it looks pretty incredible. The Dream Chair, as it's called, sports what Tempur calls a "NASA punk" vibe. This chair is not for sale, though, so don't get too excited.</p><p>The chair has a joystick on each armrest so people can maneuver the chair just how they like it without much effort. It's made to look like a spaceship cockpit, and it certainly has some style and looks like it could exist in the game. In addition to the chair itself, there is a center console with a bunch of buttons and a big screen. Wouldn't it be really fun to play Starfield like this?</p><p>The chair is on display in Cologne, Germany at Gamescom right now and then it'll move to the Saturn Xperion store in the same city next week. After that, it will move to the Tempur store in Westfield, Stratford in October 2023 where shoppers can sit down and enjoy its comfy glory.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ridiculous-starfield-gaming-chair-is-equipped-with-a-screen-cockpit-style-setup/1100-6517129/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Sony has officially announced the name and price for its upcoming Project Q handheld streaming device for PS5 games. The system is called PlayStation Portal, and it will cost $200. It is set for release sometime later this year.</p><p>Portal streams games from your PS5, so it's not a dedicated gaming device like Sony's PSP or PS Vita. But it is a way to play high-fidelity games on the toilet or in bed from your PS5. The system features adaptive triggers and haptic feedback just like the PS5's DualSense controller. It sports an 8-inch LCD screen that can reach up to 1080p/60fps, provided the Wi-Fi connection is strong and stable enough.</p><figure style="width: 2560px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4182234-ce6b14502d029b2369f5160f68f3df29dcc6d1e6-scaled.jpg"><img alt="Say hello to PlayStation Portal" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1179/11799911/4182234-ce6b14502d029b2369f5160f68f3df29dcc6d1e6-scaled.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Say hello to PlayStation Portal</figcaption></figure><p>Sony <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/08/23/playstations-first-remote-play-dedicated-device-playstation-portal-remote-player-to-launch-later-this-year-at-199-99/">said</a> PlayStation Portal is aimed at people who live in homes where the TV is frequently occupied or if they just want to play PS5 games in a different setting inside the same house. The PlayStation Portal plays your existing PS5 game library, but PlayStation VR 2 games are not supported.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-portal-sonys-new-sort-of-gaming-handheld-is-coming-this-year-for-200/1100-6517126/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Nintendo Switch Gets Official Denuvo Support To Curb PC Emulation

<p>Denuvo developer Iderto has announced that its suite of <a href="https://irdeto.com/news/denuvo-by-irdeto-now-registered-as-authorised-nintendo-switch-middleware">game protection software is now available to Nintendo Switch</a> developers, including software specifically aimed at preventing Nintendo Switch games from running on PC emulators.</p><p>Iderto made the announcement today, stating that its tools can be accessed via the Nintendo Developers Portal for existing and new games in development. The very first tool offered is the Nintendo Switch Emulator Protection, which helps prevent games from launching in emulators. This, Iderto says, will help developers close a loophole where Nintendo Switch versions of games are dumped and played on PC to circumvent Denuvo protection on respective PC versions of the same games.</p><p>"By blocking unauthorised emulations on PC, studios are able to increase their revenue during the game launch window, which is the most important period for monetisation," states Iderto. "The Nintendo Switch Emulator Protection will ensure that anyone wishing to play the game has to buy a legitimate copy."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-gets-official-denuvo-support-to-curb-pc-emulation/1100-6517127/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a> presents the <strong>Deck of Whispers</strong>, Bungie's own take on deckbuilding. Introduced in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-season-of-the-witch-adds-spooky-armor-a-hive-exotic-weapon-and-new-activities/1100-6517049/">Season of the Witch</a>, you can now find Major Arcana and Minor Arcana cards across the solar system. This mechanic allows to further customize your loadouts for certain activities.

## Destiny 2: Season Of The Witch Seasonal Challenges Guide - Week 1

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-season-of-the-witch-guides-season-pass-gear-exotics/1100-6517124/">Season of the Witch</a> has begun in Destiny 2, adding new matchmade activities, gear, and storylines to take part in. One of the big draws of a new season in Destiny 2 is that progress can unlock some terrific rewards on the premium and free tracks of the season pass, and one of the quickest ways to earn a substantial amount of XP is to complete seasonal challenges. Each week adds several of these optional objectives to the game, which primarily focus on the new matchmade activity, completing a new chapter of the ongoing storyline, and taking on enemies across the Solar system.</p><p>To kick off the first week of Season 22, you can dive into the first chapter of The Bladed Path quest. This gets you up to speed on recent events, introduces you to the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-altars-of-summoning-guide-how-to-complete-seasonal-activity-season-22/1100-6517119/">Altars of Summoning</a> activity, and ends with a big showdown against Hive and Vex forces that were subjected to experiments by Savathun. After you complete that activity, you can keep playing Altars of Summoning to earn more XP by opening chests in that event or in Savathun's Spire.</p><p>If you're confident in your aim, equip a scout or sniper rifle and start landing precision headshots to complete the Precision Calibration challenge, get multikills to generate Orbs of Power in Vanguard, Gambit, or Crucible playlists for another pursuit, and collect offerings across the system to earn some bonus XP. As a reminder, completing every seasonal challenge will award you with a bonus--and substantial--amount of Bright Dust, that can then be used on some great cosmetic items, like weapon ornaments, Exotic sparrows, and emotes.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-season-of-the-witch-seasonal-challenges-guide/1100-6517125/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p> Bungie's latest showcase introduced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-season-of-the-witch-adds-spooky-armor-a-hive-exotic-weapon-and-new-activities/1100-6517049/">a whole lot of changes, updates, and new content</a> on the horizon for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a> as it kicks off its Season of the Witch. Included in this is a suite of quality of life improvements aimed at enhancing Destiny 2's community, whether that's playing with friends, making new ones, or getting new players up to speed on the expansive game.</p><p>The changes are aimed at making sure every player can experience the Light and Darkness Saga to its fullest, as the narrative nears its conclusion. The first change Bungie is implementing is to make some activities, including campaigns and free-roaming destinations, Power-fixed, so players don't have to grind levels to experience them as intended. Activities like Nightfall, raids, and contest modes will continue to scale with player Power.</p><p>Activities that still use Power will have a new feature called Fireteam Power, where higher-level players can boost a team's overall power, allowing friends at different levels to experience more demanding activites together without facing a difficult challeng. Under this system, all players will be boosted close to the level of the team member with the highest Power Level. </p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-making-destiny-2-more-accessible-to-new-players-with-replayable-story-missions-fireteam-matching/1100-6517123/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Actors including Bella Ramsey, Stephen Fry, and Haley Atwell have signed up to a pledge intended to reduce the environmental impact of the film and TV industry. The pledge includes actions like taking trains over planes, sharing trailers, and bringing reusable water bottles and coffee cups on set, the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-66581883?xtor=AL-72-[partner]-[bbc.news.twitter]-[headline]-[news]-[bizdev]-[isapi]&amp;at_campaign_type=owned&amp;at_campaign=Social_Flow&amp;at_bbc_team=editorial&amp;at_medium=social&amp;at_format=link&amp;at_link_origin=BBCNews&amp;at_link_id=193B8044-4106-11EE-9411-610AFE754D29&amp;at_link_type=web_link&amp;at_ptr_name=twitter">BBC reports</a>.</p><p>The initiative comes in the form of a "green rider" drawn up by UK arts union Equity. A rider refers to a set of clauses that can be added to an actor's contract to specify their requirements on-set, with A-list riders often becoming infamous for highly specific, expensive, and ostentatious requests. The green rider is almost the opposite, encouraging actors to choose train travel over planes where possible, and even reducing "food and comfort requests" that require sending someone off set to fulfil.</p><p>In a statement on the rider, Bella Ramsey said it was "a practical route to positive change in the film and television industry in regards to sustainability."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tlou-actor-bella-ramsey-among-actors-pledging-to-cut-down-on-plane-trips/1100-6517122/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Mortal Kombat 1 Is Preserving Its History As Much As It's Reinventing It

<p> </p><p dir="ltr">Mortal Kombat has morphed and changed many times in its 30 years of existence. But through its various iterations--from 2D to 3D, with beat-em-up spin-offs and even a reboot in 2011--its identity has remained consistent with its two core tenets: scandalous and over-the-top violence, and dark, dire, and melodramatic storytelling. After playing about 90 minutes of Mortal Kombat 1, it's clear that NetherRealm Studios wants to stay true to this identity while completely reinventing itself. It has done this, most notably, with an emphasis on a more lighthearted tone, albeit one that is still absolutely drenched in guts and bone fragments, and a new twist on gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr">Mortal Kombat 1 is a fresh start for its universe, its characters, and even its combat. All of this is apparent in the first chapter of its new story mode, which is centered around a young Raiden (no longer the god of thunder in this new timeline) and Kung Lao, both of whom we get to see in a year zero-like setting as farmers in a small rural village. The game takes its time to show the relationship between the two, which is built on a sibling-like love and rivalry. That is, until things go awry and the Lin Kuei, a clan of assassins that is being led by Smoke, show up and demand protection money from a local restaurant. Of course, Kung Lao and Raiden step in to protect their turf. It's also in these brief moments we're given a glimpse of some new and not-so-prominent characters of the MK universe like Madame Bo, the town cook and resident martial art master, who has been teaching Raiden and Kung Lao. She's old, quirky, and tough as nails, and the moment she started thrusting punches and kicks in Smoke's face, I instantly fell in love with her (fingers crossed she's a playable character in the final roster).</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-is-preserving-its-history-as-much-as-its-reinventing-it/1100-6517109/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Ahsoka Series Premiere Easter Eggs: 8 Things You Missed In The First Two Episodes

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4181948-ahsokaeastereggsfirsttwoepisodes.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">In the series premiere of Ahsoka, we're following up on two story threads from two different Star Wars TV shows. The more obvious of the two threads comes from Star Wars: Rebels, which ended on a cliffhanger that sent the Imperial Grand Admiral Thrawn and series protagonist Ezra Bridger off into hyperspace toward a still-unknown fate. Our main protagonists here are Ahsoka Tano, Sabine Wren, and Hera Syndulla--all major Rebels characters.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Warning: The following contains spoilers for the first two episodes of Star Wars: Ahsoka on Disney+. If you have yet to watch the show, stop reading now.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The second thread is a bit more fresh. In the opening scene of the series we see a pair of Force-using, lightsaber-wielding baddies (named Baylan Skoll and Shin Hati) invade a New Republic cruiser and free a prisoner we've met before: a disciple of Thrawn named Morgan Elsbeth, who served as a one-off villain in Season 2 of The Mandalorian. These Force users don't belong to any existing Order that we know about--they seem to be mercenaries, for now.</p><p dir="ltr">All of these characters want one thing: to go to wherever Thrawn and Ezra ended up, which may or may not be in a different galaxy, and rescue the one that's on their side. So they spend much of these two episodes fighting over some kind of star map that allegedly leads to that location. By the end of the two-episode premiere, the map is in the hands of the bad guys, but our heroes are right on their tails.</p><p dir="ltr">Given that Ahsoka almost functions as a new live-action season of Rebels, most of the references to that animated series serve more as "previously on Star Wars: Rebels" sort of reminders than as true Easter eggs. But this is Star Wars--there are still plenty of real Easter eggs anyway. Let's dig in.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. Morgan Elsbeth</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4181951-ahsokamorganelsbeth.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> This character previously appeared in the 13th episode of The Mandalorian, dubbed "The Jedi." That's the episode where Ahsoka first met Din Djarin and Grogu--Elsbeth hired Djarin to kill Ahsoka, but instead they teamed up to take her down. But even after she was captured, Elsbeth kept her mouth shut about whatever she knew about Thrawn, despite Ahsoka's attempts to pry. Now, though, she's free.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. Actors who reprised their Rebels roles on Ahsoka</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4181955-ahsokapremiereeastereggsclancybrown.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Two well-known actors from Rebels return to play their characters on Ahsoka. The first is Clancy Brown as Lothal governor Ryder Azadi--Brown voiced the character in many episodes of Rebels, and he gets a brief cameo as the live-action version of the character.</p><p dir="ltr">The other is David Tennant as the voice of Ahsoka's droid Huyang. Since this is only a voice role in both shows, it only makes sense that they would want to keep Tennant around. He's pretty good at it.</p><p dir="ltr">Lars Mikkelson as Thrawn will be another example of this once he actually appears on this show, but that hasn't happened yet.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. HK droids</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4181956-ahsokahkdroids.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The bad guys on Ahsoka make heavy use of HK assassin droids wielding electrostaffs when they're doing their dirty work. These aren't the crappy, disposable battle droids we're used to--HK droids pose a challenge even for Ahsoka. HK droids originated in the video game Knights of the Old Republic and made frequent appearances in the sequel and The Old Republic MMO, but they're nearly nonexistent in the current canon. We did, however, previously see these specific models during Elsbeth's episode of The Mandalorian.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. The Nightsisters of Dathomir</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4181961-ahsokaeastereggsnightsisters.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>After Skoll and Hati free Elsbeth, they go to the remains of that ancient shrine that Ahsoka had just raided and wrecked. Elsbeth says it was built by the Nightsisters of Dathomir, who are sometimes referred to as Force witches. The Nightsisters originated in an old Expanded Universe novel from the 1990s called The Courtship of Princess Leia (it's as bad as it sounds), and they were occasionally a key faction in the Clone Wars series--Ahsoka knows them well, obviously.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. Darth Maul homage</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4181969-ahsokadarthmaul.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>During the first episode, the villainous Force apprentice Shin Hati is tracking down Sabine Wren and the map orb, and we get a scene of her standing in front of her ship consulting with a probe droid. It's gonna be tough for any Star Wars nerd to not think of a similar Darth Maul scene from The Phantom Menace when they watch this.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. A hyperdrive core from an SSD</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4181971-ahsokaeastereggshyperdrivecore.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>While Ashoka and Hera are investigating some of Elsbeth's former holdings on Corellia, they notice an unusually massive hyperdrive core sitting in the shipyard. So they ask the local corporate manager about it, and he tells them it's the hyperdrive core from "an SSD." He's not talking about a solid state drive here--in Star Wars, an SSD is short for Super Star Destroyer. The best known example of such a ship would be the Executor, Darth Vader's gigantic flagship in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. CLL, IW-37, HV-7 droids</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4181973-ahsokadroids.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>That same corporate guy namedrops a bunch of droid model numbers in quick succession, and he wasn't making up any of them. They're all lifter droids, in fact. A CLL droid is a binary load lifter seen in the original Star Wars film; an IW-37 is a load lifter with a pincer arm, as seen in Revenge of the Sith, and the HV-7 is an incredibly obscure pull from the Legacy Era supplement to the old Star Wars RPG from Wizards of the Coast. The Legacy Era consisted of a series of comics books set 130 years after Return of the Jedi--it was one of the last frontiers for the Star Wars Expanded Universe before Disney rebooted the whole thing.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>8. The Eye of Sion</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4181976-ahsokaeyeofsion.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The key to finding Thrawn, at least according to Elsbeth, is a ship called the Eye of Sion, which is apparently going to need that big hyperdrive to make the journey. This recalls a massive, Super Star Destroyer-sized ship called the Eye of Palpatine from an old novel called Children of the Jedi--in the old canon, the ship was used by remnant Imperial years about a decade after the events of Return of the Jedi in a bid to revitalize the Empire. But Children of the Jedi was a particularly weird story, and the parallels probably end there</p></h3></p><br />

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4181852-screenshot2023-08-22130805.png" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">From the confines of Gamescom Opening Night Live, horror fans got their latest look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/alan-wake-ii/">Alan Wake 2</a>, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/alan-wake-2-and-the-13-year-journey-to-make-it/2300-6461892/">sequel 13 years in the making</a>, which is finally arriving on October 27. As Remedy <em>loves</em> to hide secrets in its stories as much as we <em>love </em>to go looking for them, we're back with another trailer breakdown. This time, we managed to find a lot more than what we found when we did this <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/alan-wake-2-11-clues-you-may-have-missed-in-the-may-2023-trailer/2900-4756/">back in May</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">That's because, this time, we're heading back to the Dark Place, a place we already know fairly intimately . This is a very different-looking version of the metaphysical space than we saw before--resembling a very dangerous version of New York City--but it's familiar in that it still houses Alan, his darkest thoughts, and a seemingly limitless supply of things hoping to kill him.</p><p dir="ltr">For the uninitiated, this trailer dissection is perhaps not the best starting place. For that, you'll first want to check out our busy <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diving-deep-into-alan-wake-2/1100-6515195/">Alan Wake 2 hub</a>, which is loaded with exclusive articles, interviews, gameplay impressions, and plenty more--the type of stuff I suggest we cover despite how nerdy and in-the-weeds it gets. Somehow no one has told me I have to stop. I love my job.</p><p dir="ltr">From callbacks to Alan Wake's quasi-sequel to teases of new characters to, yes, even some more crossover with the Remedy Connected Universe, this trailer has a bit of everything for the Wake-obsessed gamer in your life--or in your heart. Without further ado, here are 23 clues and details we spotted in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/alan-wake-2-gamescom-trailer-takes-us-to-the-dark-place/1100-6516991/">Alan Wake 2's latest trailer from Gamescom 2023</a>.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The power of words</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4181926-aw2graffitti.png" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">In the opening shots of the trailer, we see a ton of graffiti, some of which we've seen in past trailers. These were clearly styled with intent behind them, as their words are not so obscure, even if we can't always be sure what they may mean. For a few examples, we see "Don't Write," "Around and Around," and "Return."</p><p dir="ltr">The formermost case likely refers to the Dark Place's wish for Alan to put away his typewriter, as the author has been trying to write his escape for over a decade. "Return" is, of course, the title of that story we see him begin to write at the end of the original game--and is also a reference to the Monomyth, or "Hero's Journey," we'll touch on again later in this recap.</p><p dir="ltr">"Around and Around" could refer to a few things. For one, it could reference how Alan's ongoing escape has him figuratively, or even literally, running in circles at times. It could also refer to a very important symbol on a particular door we mention below.</p><p dir="ltr">It should be noted that these opening shots also include a ton of loose newspapers, some of which have partial headlines visible, but I wasn't able to parse anything jaw-dropping from those bits. I did see mention of what seemed to say "demolished" or "demolition," but it's unclear to me how that may tie into the story, unless it's because the Dark Place's barrier is crumbling, giving Alan a window of opportunity to get out.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Night Springs revival</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4181925-aw2nightspringsreturn.png" /><br /><h3><p>Okay I promise not every entry will be as long as that first one. In this wider shot, we see a poster for Night Springs, the in-universe Twilight Zone-like anthology show, which Alan worked on for a time in his career. The bottom of the poster seems to say "New Season Coming Soon." Though this is all sort of in Alan's head and need not have any real-world significance, I do expect we'll get more in-game collectibles in the form of new Night Springs episodes to watch.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Nightless Night poster</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4181924-aw2movieposter.png" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">A movie poster appears on the wall for something called Nightless Night. There's a lot to say here so I'll try to be succinct. The tagline for the poster says "The heat of the murder was like a crown burning on his brow." Paired with the aesthetic of the poster, it seems to give off crime noir vibes, which is akin to what Alan was famous for writing with his <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/max-payne-is-in-the-alan-wake-2-trailer-sort-of/1100-6514594/">Alex Casey </a>books.</p><p dir="ltr">Also, the credits section for the poster are loaded with names we know, now styled in Finnish. Thomas Seine is Thomas Zane, Aleksi Kasa is Alex Casey, and it even features music from a band named Ahti and the Janitors. You may recall Ahti from Control. We know from that game that he's recently been spending time in Watery, Washington, Bright Falls' rival town. But how does Alan already know him enough to manifest his name on a poster drawn from his psyche? Or is Ahti capable of entering that metaphysical space at will?</p><p dir="ltr">It should also be noted that the image on the poster is clearly a re-colored version of the interior of Bird Leg Cabin from the first game. There's a ton of cool details here, even if they wind up as nothing but Easter eggs.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Alan's TV</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4181923-aw2tv.png" /><br /><h3><p>In his room within Bird Leg Cabin, Alan now has a 90's-style TV sitting on a desk. We know from other shots in this trailer that the TV is a LumiVista brand, which could loosely translate to "Light View," an apparent reference to the game's light and darkness themes and mechanics. Also the TV is lousy with VHS tapes beneath it for no reason we can yet discern, but it does seem to signal more of the 90's influence with which the game is said to have been made.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Oceanview Hotel/Motel</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4181922-aw2oceanview.png" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">In one of the most glaring teases of the trailer, we see Alan looking like John Wick storming through a door to shootâ€¦Alan? Is that Mr. Scratch or Alan wrestling with himself? Is there a difference? But more noteworthy is the symbol on the door. It's the same spiral we saw in the corridor of Control's Oceanview Motel, and was deduced by the game's sleuthing community to house the Alan Wake world behind it.</p><p dir="ltr">This basically confirms we'll be inside the Oceanview once more in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-alan-wake-2-fits-into-the-remedy-connected-universe/1100-6514866/">Remedy's latest connected game</a>, though from past trailers we know it seems to have undergone a name change fitting of its NYC location: the Oceanview <em>Hotel</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">Keep in mind that a popular theory suggests each locked door featuring a symbol on it within the Oceanview leads to a different Remedy connected story. Will we be opening even more of these doors in Alan Wake 2?</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Coffee World returns</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4181921-aw2coffeeworld.png" /><br /><h3><p>More times than I can recall by now, Coffee World has appeared in Alan Wake 2 imagery. New fliers for the company were even placed in the Alan Wake remaster a few years ago. It seems this Watery-based business will take on an important role in the sequel. My going theory has been that the coffee is laced with the Dark Presence and is helping the game's Cult of the Tree rapidly boost its number of devotees.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Deer masks return</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4181920-aw2cult.png" /><br /><h3><p>This is nothing too wild for those following along, but we do see another deer mask in this trailer, if only for a frame or two. These are known to be worn by members of the Cult of the Tree. The more interesting detail is who is wearing the mask. We see a better glimpse of that person's face later in this trailer, which we note below.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Mr. Door returns, as we always knew he would</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4181919-aw2bookdoor.png" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">We got a glimpse of this next section a few days ago in a Remedy press release, but here we see a lot more. Where to begin?</p><p dir="ltr">So, that's Mr. Door, a character mentioned, but not seen, in Control. Dylan Faden says he's met Mr. Door, who claims to be an interdimensional being who can "<em>shift</em>" through any of the many worlds at any time. That sounds a lot like Quantum Break's Martin Hatch, whose surname is a synonym for door and whose physical appearance, once played by the late great Lance Reddick, looks a lot like the Mr. Door we see here.</p><p dir="ltr">As far as I'm concerned, this confirms the theory that Hatch and Door are the same being, and as a legal matter, I suppose an interdimensional shapeshifter is a clean way to carry past characters you don't own into new projects you do own. There's still a lot more to learn of Door, but this one nagging question seems resolved at last.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Initiation</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4181917-aw2initiation.png" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Alan's next book, according to Door's late-night-TV-style promo shown here, is titled Initiation, which is the middle portion of Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey, sometimes known as the Monomyth, or, to Dan Harmon, the story circle. In Alan Wake, the writer was working on Departure, stage one of that story circle. At the end, he's working on Return, the final stage. Here he's promoting Initiation, the middle portion, in which the hero essentially dives head-first into the driving conflict, whereby they will later come out forever changed. It seems Alan knows he must undergo this initiation to give his return a fighting chance, according to the balance-obsessed magic of the Wake world.</p><p dir="ltr">A few other notes here: Door's show is called In Between with Mr. Door, further suggesting Dylan was being sincere. Also, who did Alan's book jacket art? That author credit is massive! Not really helping the claims of a problematic ego there, Al.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Play Me</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4181916-aw2playme.png" /><br /><h3><p>As perhaps another nod to stuff like Seven or gritty crime movies of the 90's, here Alan finds a creepy note that reads "Play Me" taped to a projector. The ensuing presentation seems to be footage of a level-headed Alan talking to himself. Perhaps Alan has left himself guidance given that his psyche is not always in a stable state.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The neighbor of the beast</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4181915-aw2665.png" /><br /><h3><p>Remedy has a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/controlgame/comments/cyb2xh/remedy_loves_to_reference_this_number_in_their/">long-running bit</a> of putting 665, or "the neighbor of the beast," in its games, dating as far back as Max Payne. Here we see it again, in the form of what might be a motel door's number. Will we learn it has more significance than a little nod to the studio's own history? Perhaps not, though it is prominently shown here.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Beneath the deer mask</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4181914-aw2mysteryperson.png" /><br /><h3><p>Here we get a look at what appears to be the person who was wearing the deer mask earlier in the trailer. Their long hair and the room's red lighting seem to match. But who is it? I feel like I'm overlooking something, but I'm just not sure. Maybe it's a new character, or maybe it's not. My other question would be what is it they're holding--a camera maybe?--and how does it disappear the way it does? Is this our world or the Dark Place?</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Ahma beer returns</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4181913-aw2ahma.png" /><br /><h3><p>We've referenced Ahma brand beer a lot this summer. Like Coffee World, it keeps popping up, and even did so in Control. Is Ahma also brewed with the sludgy darkness of Cauldron Lake or another local haunt? That could be it. Given how I stumbled on this visual when scrubbing the trailer frame by frame, I'm led to believe there are more hidden messages like this to find. Maybe I'll give it another pass.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Alan's familiar shirt</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4181912-aw2shirt.png" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Here's a neat tie-in: Alan is wearing the same black and white plaid shirt he wears throughout Alan Wake's American Nightmare, the 2012 quasi-sequel to the original game. Remedy considers the game canon, but if you needed more proof, look no further.</p><p dir="ltr">Also in this scene, we can see Alex Casey, played in part by Sam Lake, drinking coffee. It's not story-important, but according to Lake's Instagram Stories, this character detail was seemingly pulled directly from his own coffee-obsessed life.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Casey in the Dark Place</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4181911-aw2casey.png" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Here's a startling revelation: Casey appears to be in the Dark Place accosting Alan at one point. How can he get there? Or is it not really him? This is clearly something we're meant to ask, as to my memory, we haven't seen Saga there yet, only her partner. Is Casey getting there by way of the Overlap--a place where the Dark Place and natural world bleed over each other--or is he sprouting out of Wake's mind? After all, Casey was originally an Alan Wake-invented protagonist.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Dark Presence hunts</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4181910-aw2darkpresence.png" /><br /><h3><p>In this startling red shot seemingly unfolding in the dressing room for Mr. Door's show, we get a familiar first-person view of the Dark Presence assaulting Wake. In the first game, we'd hear those screams and see that blurry leap whenever we saw the world as the Dark Presence claiming a victim. So it seems even being stuck in the Dark Place hasn't meant Alan's been left alone from the story's central monster.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Monsters wear many faces</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4181909-aw2monster.png" /><br /><h3><p>We keep getting all these close-up shots of people's faces in Alan Wake 2 trailers, and here we see the creepiest one yet. In it, Alan's face withers away like lit firewood, revealing a darker, more sinister smile drenched in what seems like blood. Is this Mr. Scratch? Furthermore, all these mentions of faces have me worried someone else is not who they seem to be in the sequel. Does that explain our earlier question about Casey?</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Is this a library?</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4181908-aw2library.png" /><br /><h3><p>It's not as significant as other details here, but 10 months ago it appeared we <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/an-alan-wake-2-teaser-image-might-be-hiding-in-a-new-remedy-video/1100-6508279/">may have gotten a glimpse at a section of Alan Wake 2 in a Remedy-released video</a>. In it, we saw an early version of a third-person game set in what looked like the New York Public Library. This image from the trailer might be that same place, which would confirm that Alan heads to this real-world location at some point, albeit likely a Dark Place-set version of it. Does Alan have overdue books? It's just one of many lingering mysteries.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Overlap</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4181907-aw2overlap.png" /><br /><h3><p>As best I can tell from earlier snippets, the Overlap--where our world and the Dark Place collide, allowing for some to cross between them--features this deep red aesthetic. Combine that with the intersecting triangles we keep seeing, and it seems like Alan is shown here in the Overlap. But does that mean the Cult of the Tree, which seems to use this same symbol, is interested in the Dark Place? If so, for what purposes?</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>A Nightmare on Sleep Street</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4181906-aw2freddy.png" /><br /><h3><p>This is Remedy's first survival-horror game, and no matter what the story is actually conveying in this scene, it gave me big Freddy Krueger vibes. "Don't Sleep Again," says the distorted subway signage. The next frame features a different version, too: "Stop Writing Wake." The Dark Place is hellbent on keeping the writer trapped where he is. If only it had a glove made of knives, maybe it would have wrapped this up by now.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Wake in the woods</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4181905-aw2wakeinwoods.png" /><br /><h3><p>Here we curiously see Alan doing battle with a cult member, but it seems to be happening in the wilderness of Bright Falls. Does Alan escape the Dark Place so soon that it can be in the trailer, or is something else going on here?</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Casey's projection</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4181904-aw2caseyprojection.png" /><br /><h3><p>Here we see a very Control-style shadow projection of who appears to be Alex Casey. This doesn't give us any apparent answers but further asks the question of Casey's true role in this story. Can Special Agent Anderson trust him? Can Alan? Can anyone?</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The ritual</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4181903-aw2ritual.png" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Our final clue is not a visual, but rather a few spoken words. "This is the ritual to lead you on. Your friends will meet him when you're gone." It sounds like something the Cult of the Tree might say, but then why are they bringing up something Thomas Zane told Wake when he first got to the Dark Place? Referring to Mr. Scratch, Zane said Alan's "friends will meet him when you're gone."</p><p dir="ltr">That seemed like a healthy compromise at the time, but since then, Scratch has seemed to become the subject of urban legends that have twisted Alan's departure into the story of a killer who was never caught. What is the ritual, and whose side is the cult really on? I promised clues, but looking back on this project now, I have many more questions than I did when I started out.</p><p dir="ltr">Are you ready to unravel the mystery? Alan Wake 2 arrives on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and the Epic Games Store on October 27.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />
