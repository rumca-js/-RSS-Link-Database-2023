Who is Joe Rogan? I listened to countless episodes of his podcast to understand his past and his influence.

My next video is live on Nebula NOW! In this video, we used leaked and declassified documents to explore the run up to the Iraq war, and how the invasion of Iraq and removal of Saddam Hussein was planned within hours of the attacks on 9/11.
