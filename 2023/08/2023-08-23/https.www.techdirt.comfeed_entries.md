Clearview has suffered tons of self-inflicted damage during its relatively short life as a viable, if execrable, product. Always willing to put its worst foot forward, the company built an AI backbone to support its voluminous webscraping, gathering up everything that wasn&#8217;t locked down on the internet and applying its facial recognition algorithm to it.

So, yesterday we had the story of how, at Elon’s personal request, exTwitter is moving to get rid of link and snippet text in what had been known as Twitter Cards for news organizations. Musk claims that it’s for “esthetic” reasons, though in our article, we noted the uncanny timing of this decision coming just [&#8230;]

As a child, nothing warmed me more than my mother’s “Three C’s Soup”: Cabbage, Carrot, Carraway from Jane Brody’s Good Food Book: Living the High Carbohydrate Way (published in 1980 and still in print, no ebook version has yet been licensed). And when my mother died in late fall 2018, there was nothing I wanted [&#8230;]

Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut wrote an NY Times op-ed piece a few weeks ago (there’s so much nonsense all the time that it takes a little while to find the time to respond to all of it), claiming that “Algorithms are Making Kids Desperately Unhappy.” He wrote this in support of his “The Protecting [&#8230;]

Having clearly not learned many lessons from the ongoing and growing repercussions for false claims of election fraud, election conspiracy theorist Mike Lindell&#160;last week unveiled his new plan (see video) to &#8220;monitor&#8221; election polling places by using&#8230; drones.
