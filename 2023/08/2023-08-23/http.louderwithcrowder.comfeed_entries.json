He had a freak accident playing a pick-up game of basketball and was rushed to the hospital. He was to be the old white guy all the way to the right of the stage. As opposed to Asa Hutchinson all the way to the left of the stage. </p><p>Some of you may be wondering \"but I thought the North Dakota Governor was an absolute smokeshow.\" You're thinking South Dakota governor Kristi Noem, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kristi-noem-unprecedented-attacks\" target=\"_blank\">who is fiiiiiiine</a>. Doug Burham, I had no idea existed let alone was a candidate until he was announced yesterday. And I say that as someone who is entrenched in this junk.</p><p>How did this guy <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tonights-gop-debate\" target=\"_blank\">get on the debate stage</a>? It's one of the reasons why the RNC is useless and the debates are silly. The RNC sets rules and guidelines to wade through the unserious candidates who are just looking for their fifteen-minutes of PAY ATTENTION TO MEEEEEEEEE!</p><p>Burgum <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/doug-burgum-basketball-injury-gop-primary-debate-2024-2023-8\" target=\"_blank\">exploited those guidelines by donating</a> ten million dollars to his own campaign. Then he paid people $20 in gift cards if they donated $1 to his campaign so he could meet the donor threshold. And for that, he gets to take away precious TV time that could be given to cats like Ron DeSantis, Vivek Ramaswamy, or Tim Scott who at the very least has a puncher's chance.</p><p>Or, he would have gotten the chance. He has a high-grade tear of his Achilles tendon and can't stand up without crutches. Oh well. We here at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website were excited to hear his opinions on... I don't even have the snark.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">><span><span><span><span><span><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

While I'm well-skilled-ish in matters of political and cultural criticism, I discovered I am unfamiliar with the elventy-five different metrics that judge a beer's success. In June, there was only one metric where it was trending downward. Now, we have year-to-date basis, <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2023/08/22/bud-light-dethroned-by-modelo-after-dylan-mulvaney-fiasco/\" target=\"_blank\">according to the latest data from NielsenIQ</a>. Bud Light is out. Modello is in.\n</p><blockquote>\n\tModelo, which is distributed in the US by New York-based Constellation Brands, had an 8.34% share of dollars spent on beer compared to 8.28% for Bud Light through Aug. 12, NIQ reported.\n</blockquote><p>\n\tDon't get too excited. <a href=\"https://www.the-sun.com/money/8254224/who-owns-modelo-beer-ceo/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Modello is owned in the United States</a> by Constellation Brands. Outside of the United States, it's owned by... Anheuser-Busch. Plus we're sure Constellation Brands sells out to the same woke pandering to the radical left that every other corporation in America does.

Speaking as a right-wing sonuvabitch, as much as I'd like for us to take credit, we're not that organized.

Dylan Mulvaney and the leftist assistance to politicize every aspect of your life is out. </p><p>The question for all of us to ask is what we're doing to reach out to the 20% now.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

But <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tucker-carlson-asa-hutchinson\" target=\"_blank\">Asa Hutchinson was murdered by Tucker Carlson</a>, and I don't even know what a Doug Burgum is. </p><p>It starts tonight at 9:00 pm on Rumble or one of them cable news channels. But I know that you know that I know where you're going to be watching.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LWCnewswire/status/1694303033595715874\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Missing from the stage is frontrunner Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/donald-trump-backs-out-of-gop-primary-debate\" target=\"_blank\">who announced this week he won't be taking part in any debate</a>. For the other candidates, this can be both a blessing and a curse. Trump not being on stage means he won't be sucking all the oxygen out of the room, and other candidates have a chance to break through. However, that also means they need to break through. And without Trump there to make everything about Trump drama, the moderators will make everything about the other candidates' drama. Talk about issues? You must be new.</p><p>I also don't see anything happening tonight to affect the polls. With all the unearned media and with his status as the former president, Trump is going to remain #1 in public opinion polls for the rest of the year. The ONLY thing that will change the polls is the results of the Iowa Caucus. If someone other than Trump wins, the polls, and the race will be in flux until Super Tuesday. If Trump wins, good game everyone.</p><p>Without Trump there, that makes Ron DeSantis the \"frontrunner\" of the debate. He needs to just not have a \"Marco Rubio\" moment. Rubio in 2016 was tracking to potentially win the New Hampshire primary before he got disemboweled by Chris Christie at the last debate. A possible win turned into a FIFTH place finish. DeSantis's biggest problem heading into the debate is that he got f*cked by his SuperPAC leaking to the media what they want him to do. Now if he does things he was going to do anyway, like criticize one of his opponents or defend Trump against the Left's witch hunt, is it going to look like \"he's only doing what the SuperPAC said?\" The only Republicans NOT defending Trump against Biden's DOJ being weaponized against him are auditioning for a cable news job.</p><p>Vivek Ramaswamy is one of the two candidates I'm most interested in seeing tonight. He has had a number of breakthrough moments on the campaign trail and combating cable news journalismers, and a few polls have him #2 nationally. But the knives are starting to come out, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AGHamilton29/status/1694135739645087892\" target=\"_blank\">and there are a number of issues he changed his position on since last year</a>. This will be his first appearance on the national stage. Will he \"<a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/vivek-ramaswamy-eminem\" target=\"_blank\">lose himself in the moment</a>\" or will it be \"times up, over, blouww?\"</p><p>The other person is Tim Scott, and it goes back to the Iowa Caucus. He is number three with five months to go. But unlike the last three upset Caucus winners (which were the last three IA Caucus winners), Scott can then go to South Carolina where he is a US Senator and Republicans have voted for him statewide already.</p><p>I'd be very excited to vote for Chris Christie for president... in 2012. Eleven years later, while Trump is #1 in the polls, Christie is #1 in the highest UNfavorability rankings. His entire debate plan was to attack Trump live on stage. Otherwise, he has nothing to say. What he does without Trump there, we'll find out later tonight.</p><p>Everyone else? Meh. Nikki Haley may get spared from being cut out of the second debate depending on the South Carolina polls where she's the former governor. The other three, I don't even know why they are there for this one.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

It's tricky because everyone is entitled to their own opinion \u2014 but a lot of opinions don't feel based in anything except fear or propaganda.\"</em></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"773a7\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=35064318&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>It pairs well with <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jennifer-aniston-vaxhole\" target=\"_blank\">The One About Jennifer Aniston Being Sad People Call Her 'Liberal Vax-hole' Because She's a Liberal Vax-hole</a>.

Foxx posted about being betrayed in his personal life and a few randos on X claimed he was attacking Jews. Aniston -- who has proven that she WON'T be there for you, contrary to what the song says -- got wrapped up in it. Instead of calling bullsh*t claimed that she didn't like Foxx's post on purpose OR on accident.
