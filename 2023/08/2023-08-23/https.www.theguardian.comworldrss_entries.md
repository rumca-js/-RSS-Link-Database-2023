## India’s south pole moon landing is big business for global space race

<p>India has raised its spacefaring profile and will now be seen as low-cost provider for missions possible</p><p>For all the risks, for all that was riding on a successful landing, the descent to the moon’s surface was remarkably uneventful, if not exactly stress-free. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/aug/23/india-chandrayaan-3-moon-landing-mission">Vikram lander</a>, part of India’s Chandrayaan-3 mission, dropped steadily on its thrusters to the rock below, slowed to a hover as it approached the ground, and finally came to a rest on the dusty terrain.</p><p>When confirmation came that the lander was down, anxiety in the control room gave way to cheers and applause. With the soft touchdown, India becomes the first country to land a probe at the moon’s south pole, a rugged region where deep craters lie in permanent shadow and where ice could provide water, oxygen and fuel for future missions. The first will be on the moon itself, and in lunar orbit, but they could also supply trips to Mars, with the benefit that the materials do not need to be lifted off the Earth’s surface at great cost. It is a region of key scientific interest.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/23/india-south-pole-moon-landing-big-business-global-space-launch-market">Continue reading...</a>
