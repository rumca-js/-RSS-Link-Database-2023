To this day, I\u2019ve never been able to identify them. They\u2019re just people celebrating carnival. What they are doing is called daggering, a form of dancing in the Caribbean. It usually has a run-up and a jump, then a dancing motion. It\u2019s very common in Jamaican dancehall. This was an extreme version, performed on the top of a bus stop. They have since changed those bus stops as people would mount them and there were several accidents.

Taking place in Cologne, it\u2019s a very different beast to its American counterpart, aimed much more at the public (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/aug/22/like-going-to-glastonbury-gamescom-boosts-festival-feel-to-draw-gamers-back\">as Keza reports here</a>), and focusing on hands-on demos, rather than endless press conferences. The proof of that could be found in its opening night livestream on Tuesday, a sprawling jamboree of trailers and gameplay clips produced and presented by Geoff Keighley, a one-time journalist, Game Awards organiser and now apparently the only person allowed to make global game events.</p><p>What the night showed is that Gamescom is not quite as slickly stage managed as E3. Keighley was interrupted by stage invaders who demanded the release of GTA 6, and there were awkward segments including an interview with cosplayers. Then Zack Snyder was given several minutes to promote <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rHLOXbFZtI\">his forthcoming movie Rebel Moon</a>, which, to be fair, did look more like a video game than a lot of actual video games. And even though plenty of women were on stage, the night had an arch-dudebros-of-the-industry feel, with Todd Howard, Ed Boon, Troy Baker and Phil Spencer popping up, each one seemingly determined to use the exclamation \u201cinsane!\u201d more than any previous guest.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/aug/23/pushing-buttons-gamescom-2023-announcements\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/aug/23/pushing-buttons-gamescom-2023-announcements", "date_published": "2023-08-23T14:41:56.091631+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Kenyan festivities, wintering flamingos and a snacking panda: Wednesday\u2019s best photos", "description": "<p>The Guardian\u2019s picture editors select photo highlights from around the world</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/gallery/2023/aug/23/kenyan-festivities-wintering-flamingos-and-a-snacking-panda-wednesdays-best-photos\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/gallery/2023/aug/23/kenyan-festivities-wintering-flamingos-and-a-snacking-panda-wednesdays-best-photos", "date_published": "2023-08-23T13:38:24.909617+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "People\u2019s archive to collect memories of crime drama Taggart", "description": "<p>Glasgow Caledonian University project to \u2018give people chance to add their stories to programme\u2019s legacy\u2019</p><p>The menacing chords of the theme tune played over the title card of a brooding Glasgow skyline remain instantly recognisable: Taggart, one of the longest-running police dramas in the world, became a national institution across its staggering 27-season run.</p><p>But the series, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/may/12/taggart-axed-by-itv\">which finally wrapped in 2010</a>, made the city and its people stars and now to coincide with the 40th anniversary of its pilot, Glasgow Caledonian University is launching a people\u2019s archive to recognise the role the public played in the drama.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/aug/23/taggart-crime-drama-people-archive-glasgow-caledonian-university-collect-memories\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/aug/23/taggart-crime-drama-people-archive-glasgow-caledonian-university-collect-memories", "date_published": "2023-08-23T13:38:24.834501+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Shelf: The Kids\u2019 Show review \u2013 mayonnaise on your Oreo?

Environmentalists highlight the additional impacts of industrial sand extraction, activity which has been described as an \u201coutlier\u201d case within Europe by UN experts and which may be redistributing toxins in the lough bed. <br /><br />The lough, which at nearly 400 sq km has a surface area bigger than Malta, and its surrounding wetlands hold a considerable number of domestic and international conservation protections. But campaigners point to a serious lack of regulation and sharply declining wildlife as signs of long-term neglect and unintegrated thinking as regards the lough\u2019s management.<br /><br />A 2013 study by researchers at Queen\u2019s University Belfast found that the number of migratory winter birds had dropped by nearly 80% in a decade. It also highlighted a 66% fall in certain insect and snail species inhabiting the lough bed.<br /><br />\u201cLough Neagh is dying and it\u2019s dying in plain sight,\u201d said James Orr, Friends of the Earth NI\u2019s director.<br /><br />\u201cSo interrelated and long-term are Lough Neagh\u2019s problems that if it were a person it would be described as suffering from multiple organ failure. <br /><br />\u201cHow an ecosystem that is so immense, so strategic, so beautiful, so rich in heritage has been ignored, forgotten and abused for decades is the story of wild west exploitation.\u201d<br /><br />About two dozen organisations \u2013 spanning devolved government departments, councils and charities \u2013 have varying degrees of responsibility for Lough Neagh\u2019s management. But these groups are fragmented and siloed, campaigners say, with there being no agency or body that exercises executive control over the lough.<br /><br />The last major research facility at Lough Neagh, operated mainly by the University of Ulster at Tra\u00e1d Point near Ballyronan along the lough\u2019s north-western shores, closed more than a decade ago.<br /><br />The soil, bed and banks of the lough are owned by the Shaftesbury estate, whose claim to the water body dates back to the Plantation of Ulster in the early 1600s. The current Earl of Shaftesbury, Nicholas Ashley-Cooper, has in recent weeks indicated he would be open to selling the asset.<br /><br />Devolved administrations have explored public ownership of Lough Neagh a number of times since the 1970s, with the most recent bid floundering a decade ago.</p> <a

In fact, just such a fruitless mission inspired this week\u2019s quest. It\u2019s a shame, too: in my book, all ice-cream is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jul/16/it-feels-sinless-jay-rayner-britain-ice-cream-business-booming\">good ice-cream</a>, but there\u2019s something particularly joyful about a pink quiff of strawberry ice: British summer in a sticky, dripping cone.

In fact, the self-awareness of Washington\u2019s performance \u2013 as crafted and mannered as Olivier playing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Critic_(play)\">Mr Puff</a> at the Old Vic \u2013 is a part of how mesmeric it is, and that final heartstopping twist is a glorious showstopper from Ayer, the screenwriter whose masterpiece this film is. Around the same time, Quentin Tarantino and Roger Avary had been finding a kind of breezy, intoxicating irony and cynicism in violence; Michael Mann revelled in the military discipline and organisation of cops and criminals; Abel Ferrara located a desperate vision of evil in his Bad Lieutenant smoking the crack he had confiscated. But Ayer and Fuqua were doing something more old-fashioned, more rooted in a (distant) belief in due process and crime not paying.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/23/training-day-review-denzel-washingtons-finest-most-sinister-hour\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/23/training-day-review-denzel-washingtons-finest-most-sinister-hour", "date_published": "2023-08-23T08:12:51.344846+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "UK minister heads to India as post-Brexit trade talks reportedly ramp up \u2013 business live", "description": "<p>UK trade secretary Kemi Badenoch is expected to progress talks with Indian counterparts in Jaipur, during a meeting of G20 trade ministers</p><p>The combined drop in German business activity takes the composite PMI reading to 44.7, from July\u2019s 48.5.</p><p>Reuters is reporting that this is the steepest decline in business activity for more than three years, since May 2020.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/aug/23/uk-minister-kemi-badenoch-india-trade-talks-intensify-pmi-pwc-markets-sterling-pound-economy-ftse-business-brexit-live\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/aug/23/uk-minister-kemi-badenoch-india-trade-talks-intensify-pmi-pwc-markets-sterling-pound-economy-ftse-business-brexit-live", "date_published": "2023-08-23T08:12:51.328227+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Mundi Mundi Bash: rockin\u2019 and racing in the outback \u2013 in pictures", "description": "<p>More than 12,000 people attended the three-day festival near Broken Hill in far-western NSW headlined by Australian bands Icehouse and the Hoodoo Gurus</p><ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/gallery/2023/aug/06/garma-festival-2023-celebrating-past-present-and-future-in-pictures\">Garma festival 2023: celebrating past, present and future \u2013 in pictures</a></strong></li></ul> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/gallery/2023/aug/23/rockin-and-racing-in-the-outback-the-mundi-mundi-bash-in-pictures\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/gallery/2023/aug/23/rockin-and-racing-in-the-outback-the-mundi-mundi-bash-in-pictures", "date_published": "2023-08-23T07:07:36.720956+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Shakespeare\u2019s Globe\u2019s LGBTQ production of As You Like It \u2013 in pictures", "description": "<p>A glimpse behind the scenes of the predominantly young cast of the London theatre\u2019s LGBTQ-aware, gender-blind casting production of As You Like It, directed by Ellen McDougall.
