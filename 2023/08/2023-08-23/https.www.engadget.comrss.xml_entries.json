The series is a direct sequel to <em>Rebels</em> in almost every way. But while that's great news for fans, the downside is that newcomers to the wider <em>Rebels</em> verse, even those who've seen Ahsoka in <em>The Mandalorian</em> and <em>The Book of Boba Fett, </em>will have a hard time finding any emotional stakes.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img alt=\"Rosario Dawson in Ahsoka on Disney+.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/df904950-41e7-11ee-b7fd-7ad92e5fd5bd\" style=\"height: 1608px; width: 3840px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Lucasfilm</div></figure><p>With the previous live action Star Wars TV shows (including the enjoyable-yet-unneccessary <em>Obi-Wan Kenobi </em>series), Filoni and co-producer Jon Favreau tried to ease general audiences into deeper aspects of <em>Star Wars </em>lore. That was most successful in the first season of <em>The Mandalorian</em>, which was filled with new characters and simple emotional stakes. (Protect Baby Yoda, no matter what it takes!) But Filoni eventually managed to bring in some characters from his animated shows, including the nefarious bounty hunter Cad Bane.</p><p>For better or worse, <em>Ahsoka</em> feels like a riskier project than any of those other live action shows. Almost everyone refers to events and major characters from <em>Rebels</em>, without explaining much about who they are. We know that Grand Admiral Thrawn seems like a major new antagonist, but the show never says why. We later learn that <em>Ahsoka</em> is driven to find him because that may reveal the location of Ezra Bridger, the main character of <em>Rebels</em> who disappeared at the end of that series.

Ahsoka is Filoni's baby, after all, and he's too talented of a storyteller to have her tread water for a season. And I'll admit, even the excellent <em>Andor </em>took a few episodes to really rev things up.

And there are hints of interesting character dynamics moving forward.&nbsp;</p><p>In the years since Rebels ended, it turns out Ahsoka started training Sabine as a Jedi, but then abandoned her. It\u2019s a reflection of Ahsoka\u2019s own story, where she started as Anakin Skywalker\u2019s padawan before a (very complicated) series of events pushed her out of the Jedi Order. Can Ahsoka make up for her mistakes, or is she doomed to fail her student like her master failed her?</p><p>At the very least, <em>Ahsokai\u2019s </em>first two episodes are far more intriguing than the <em>Book of Boba Fett</em> or <em>Obi-Wan\u2019s</em> intros. Both of those shows felt superfluous \u2013 did we really need Boba Fett\u2019s backstory <em>and</em> redemption tale? Did seeing another Obi-Wan and Darth Vader duel really accomplish anything? At least <em>Ahsoka</em> is trying to push <em>Star Wars</em> into new territory.

The tools are common with PC titles but, until now, were unavailable for Switch developers.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Though Denuvo is useful beyond the prevention of emulation, that seems to be the primary intent here, with Irdeto touting a new dev portal called the <a href=\"https://irdeto.com/denuvo/nintendo-switch-emulator-protection/\"><ins>Nintendo Switch Emulation Protection program.</ins></a> The company calls it a \u201crevolutionary technology to protect games launching on Nintendo Switch from piracy.\u201d It also notes that Switch piracy hurts PC sales as well, as the games pirated from Nintendo\u2019s console are playable on PC, bypassing Steam, Epic and other official online retailers.</p><p>Now, this might be good news for Switch devs, but Denuvo <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-24-denuvo-anti-piracy-irdeto-acqusition.html\"><ins>has a spotty track record,</ins></a> despite boasting that it has protected more than 1,000 games from emulation. This is DRM software, plain and simple, so it\u2019s known to slow down performance when installed, leading some publishers to actually remove the middleware post-launch. Additionally, there\u2019s been some high-priority misfires with the software, with hackers cracking <em>Middle-Earth: Shadow of Wa</em>r in less than a day, and that\u2019s with Denuvo installed. It\u2019s also known for being quite expensive, likely putting the software out of reach for smaller studios and development teams.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch is over six years old, with a successor <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-says-itll-be-easy-to-transfer-over-to-its-next-console-211411270.html\"><ins>expected in the nearish future. </ins></a>In other words, why did this take so long? Nobody knows.

But the convenience of getting a new read instantaneously and carrying a full bookcase in your pocket is pretty appealing. Ereaders combine the best of paper and computers, and they\u2019re capable of storing thousands of books at a time. Amazon's Kindle ecosystem dominate this market, but that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t worthy competitors. Other companies, particularly Kobo, now make solid ebook readers, such as the Clara and the Elipsa, that might be better for your needs. We tested out some of the best ereaders available and are sharing our top picks to help you find the best buy.</p><h2>What to look for in an ereader</h2><p>Plenty of apps, including the Kindle app, will let you download and read digital books on a phone or tablet. But what makes ebook readers different is the screen: nearly all of them use technology from a company called E Ink. It manufactures electronic paper displays (EPD) composed of three sheets: one containing millions of microcapsules filled with black and white ink particles sandwiched between transparent electrode layers. When a charge is applied, either the black or white particles shift to the top, forming letters and the whitespace around them.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Because these displays are so different from standard LED panels, you can expect most ereaders to do a number of things well. They\u2019ll be easier to stare at for long periods of time and easier to read in direct sunlight. Also, since E Ink displays only require power to rearrange the ink, these devices have much longer battery lives than standard tablets: we\u2019re talking weeks, not days.</p><p>The ereader market is not as saturated as, say, the smartphone market, but there are still plenty of options out there and they do have small but important differences among them. They tend to range from around $100 to more than $400, though usually the higher end options are read/write <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html\">E Ink tablets</a>. Beyond price, you should consider physical properties like buttons, lights, storage and resolution, as well as how the software lets you find and access books.</p><h3><strong>Reading features</strong></h3><p>With any ereader, you\u2019ll navigate the OS via taps and swipes, and some add physical page-turn buttons. Most with built-in buttons have an auto-rotating screen so you can press with your right or left hand.</p><p>As E Ink technology has advanced, resolution has greatly improved \u2013 even the budget Kindle ereader has a 300 ppi display. You can still find models with lower resolution, but we don\u2019t recommend them.</p><p>Some ereaders have front LEDs that support light temperature adjustment. That means you can switch to a warmer light after the sun goes down, which will feel easier on the eyes. If you\u2019re concerned about blue light, you should go for a reader with that feature.</p><h3><strong>Other features</strong></h3><p>The capabilities of these pocket libraries have <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/kindle-scribe-update-adds-new-brushes-and-better-organization-210011764.html\">advanced</a> considerably since the early days. In addition to storing books, some let you browse the web, run apps and play music. The screen\u2019s frame rate can\u2019t handle gaming, but it\u2019s good enough to show you the Wikipedia entry for Constantinople while you read <em>Cloud Cuckoo Land</em>.</p><p>If you listen to audiobooks, you may want an ereader capable of playing them. Most of the models we tested have that ability, with the notable exception of the Nook ereader we tried. Keep in mind that audiobook files can take up more space than print files so you'll probably want a higher capacity device if you plan on doing a lot of listening.</p><p>Above all, you should consider where and how you intend to find books to read. Most ereaders make it easiest to shop through their own ebook store, but all of them (even <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazon-kindle-supports-epub-format-002501848.html\">Kindles</a>) will now let you download titles from other sources, like libraries, unaffiliated ebook sellers and free public domain sites.</p><figure><img alt=\"An assortment of ereaders, including ones from Kobo, Kindle, Boox, Nook and PocketBook are arranged on a tan bamboo desk with a white keyboard and black mouse in the background. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/c06d4490-cf16-11ed-96e7-3cba2c2f1226\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Amy Skorheim / Engadget</div></figure><h2>How to get books for your ereader</h2><p>Kindle, Nook and Kobo all have their own stores that you access directly from each brand\u2019s devices.

If the file includes digital rights management (which protects against unauthorized copying) you\u2019ll need to authorize your ereader, which requires using or creating a free <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2hlbHB4LmFkb2JlLmNvbS9tYW5hZ2UtYWNjb3VudC91c2luZy9jcmVhdGUtdXBkYXRlLWFkb2JlLWlkLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUxZGNjYmNkLWFjNjUtNGZjMC05OWQzLTZkOWNkMzg5YWNiMSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAdc_8x25JonTQFn98atBuZoAQe0WIiwK_QGoj2UYpSJj&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fhelpx.adobe.com%2Fmanage-account%2Fusing%2Fcreate-update-adobe-id.html\">Adobe ID</a>.

Overdrive recently announced that it will <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/e-book-library-app-overdrive-is-shutting-down-on-may-1st-194807737.html\">sunset its legacy app</a>, so Libby will be your one and only option if you access library books via Overdrive.</p><p><a href=\"https://help.kobo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017677053-Borrow-eBooks-from-the-public-library-using-your-Kobo-eReader\">Kobo</a> readers have built-in access to Overdrive, and that will not change despite the mobile app\u2019s shutdown. Once you\u2019ve linked your library card, the search function will include results for titles available from your local library; a few taps will upload your selections to your device for the length of the loan. I personally find it easiest to borrow the title I want through the Libby app on my phone. After that, the book pops up on my Kobo\u2019s home screen once the device syncs.</p><p>To read library books on a <a href=\"https://help.overdrive.com/en-us/0431.html\">Kindle</a>, you can either go through the Libby app or the Overdrive section of your library\u2019s website. Once you click Borrow, you\u2019ll see the option to \u201cRead now with Kindle,\u201d which takes you to Amazon\u2019s site to sign in. After that, the book will be delivered to your device the next time it connects to WiFi.</p><p>For other ereaders, you\u2019ll go through your library\u2019s Overdrive portal and download the ePub after clicking the Borrow button. You can then use the ADE process we described above. Devices that run external apps, like the Boox Leaf 2, allow you to read library books via the Libby app, just as you would on a smartphone or tablet.</p><p>You can also use the Libby app to borrow audiobooks, but you won\u2019t be able to access them through your ereader. (The exception is an ereader, like the Boox Leaf 2, that allows external apps). I found it was easier to listen to an audiobook on my phone anyway, regardless of whether I borrowed it through Libby or bought it from Kindle or Kobo.</p><figure><img alt=\"Four ereaders are arranged on a dark brown wooden table outside.

We look at what\u2019s available, what\u2019s new, and what shoppers and professional reviewers have to say. Then we narrow a list to the best candidates for hands-on testing.</p><p>I ended up getting eight ereaders, representing five different brands: Amazon, Kobo, Barnes &amp; Noble, Boox and PocketBook. I bought, borrowed and uploaded books for each device using the methods above. Over the course of four weeks I evaluated each one in the areas of book access, ease of reading, extra features and overall value.</p><p>Here\u2019s everything we tested:</p><ul><li><p><a

Clara 2E</a> when I was off the clock and reading for my own satisfaction. That alone doesn\u2019t make it the best ereader for most people, but the excellent design, performance and interface does. The Clara 2E is helpful from the moment you turn it on. It walks you through setting up an account so you can buy books, then asks about your recent favorite reads to improve its personalized recommendations.</p><p>It also tells you right away about its Overdrive integration that lets you check out ebooks from your library directly on the device. It was refreshing to be pointed towards something free, instead of just showing me more ways to spend money. The borrowing integration is seamless: you can find library books by searching for a title or browsing in the Overdrive tab in the Discover section, where the Kobo store lives.</p><p>The Discover tab and the Kobo store are nicely organized, with top sellers, deals and recommendations based on your history. Title pages are clean and uncluttered, giving you access to synopsis, reviews and preview samples. You can even mark a title as read, to deepen the algorithm's understanding of your preferences. Unlike Amazon\u2019s Kindle store, audiobooks and ebooks are in separate tabs. I would have liked to have them together, and would love it if Kobo did what Amazon does and offer a discount if you buy the audiobook and text version together.</p><p>The customization options on the Clara are just right \u2013 there aren\u2019t so many that it\u2019s overwhelming, but you can fine-tune things enough to make the device yours. Features like sleep screens, gesture controls, and headers and footers are all customizable. You can also decide how your library is organized. Navigation is intuitive and I rarely had trouble finding what I was looking for in the settings.</p><p>But what really sets the Clara 2E apart is the reading experience. It\u2019s lightweight and has a textured back for a sure grip, with one rear button controlling sleep, wake and power. The thin bezel makes the device compact enough to cradle in your hand like a smartphone, but is thick enough for your thumb to rest comfortably in a pinch grip.</p><p>On top of that, the front light is lovely. This model gives you both brightness and temperature adjustment, and the quality and subtlety of the glow creates a screen that\u2019s the closest to paper of any ereader I\u2019ve tried. You can also adjust the brightness on the fly by sliding your thumb up or down the left edge of the screen \u2013 such a simple feature, but one I used repeatedly. The text is crisp and the ghosting is minor. Text size, font style, line spacing and margins are minutely adjustable and available with a tap as you read.</p><p>Of all the readers, the Clara 2E was the most responsive to my touch. Rarely did it mistake a tap for a swipe or vice versa, and after I learned the controls, I was always brought exactly to where I wanted to go.</p><p>My favorite feature was how fast it woke up. Push the button and you immediately see the page you were last reading. Some ereaders make you push a button, swipe, then wait as the screen flashes and refreshes before finally loading your book. I like to fill spare moments by getting in a page or two, so a speedy wake is key. The page turns are also quick, though in a side-by-side comparison, the Kindle was just a touch faster.</p><p>For $140, the Clara 2E is pricier than other readers with six-inch screens. The standard Kindle is the exact same size and shape, and can be had for as little as $100 if you\u2019re willing to put up with constantly being served ads on your lockscreen. You\u2019ll pay $120 for the luxury of an ad-free model. The Kindle also isn\u2019t waterproof and has no warm light option. In contrast, the Clara has no ads, can handle an accidental dunk in the bathtub and won\u2019t kill your eyes with a ton of blue light.

When you buy both iterations of a title, you not only get a discount, but the Whispersync feature lines up where you are in the e-printed version with the narration, too. Say you listen for an hour and then want to read \u2013 the synchronization lets you pick up on-screen where you left off audibly. (Though we should point out that you can\u2019t listen and read simultaneously on the same device.) In tests, the feature was fairly accurate, getting me close enough on the page or in the audio to figure out my spot.</p><p>The standard Kindle doesn\u2019t feel particularly luxurious, but it doesn\u2019t feel cheap either. The shell has a velvety finish that doesn\u2019t collect fingerprints, but I found myself wishing it had more texture for a better grip. Navigating from a page to the menu isn\u2019t as speedy as Paperwhite or the Kobos we tried. And it takes a few moments to wake from sleep after hitting the button and swiping.</p><p>Page turns are quick, but the touchscreen gestures didn\u2019t always do what I wanted them to. I\u2019d often find the page skipping forward when I thought I\u2019d tapped to go back. There\u2019s no warm light, which didn\u2019t bother me during the day, but at night it felt like I was still staring at my computer.</p><p>Kindle\u2019s reading customization is great, letting you dial in the font, size and margins. You can even save a set of settings as a \u201ctheme,\u201d something not offered by other devices. I created one with larger text and wider line spacing called \u201ctired eyes.\u201d</p><p>Some people won\u2019t be bothered by the lock screen ads that come standard on every Kindle device (unless you pay to remove them). They\u2019re fairly innocuous, mostly promoting Kindle book deals or specific titles (it\u2019s not like you\u2019ll see promos for TVs or robotic pool cleaners). Personally, I like being able to set the sleep screen to the book cover of what I\u2019m currently reading, but it\u2019s easy to get over that if all you want is a more convenient way to consume books at the lowest price.</p><h3>Amazon Kindle</h3><ul><li><p>Screen size: 6\u201d</p></li><li><p>Resolution: 300dpi</p></li><li><p>Capacity: 16GB</p></li><li><p>Waterproof rating: None</p></li><li><p>Warm light: No</p></li></ul><h2>Best reader with buttons: Kobo Libra 2</h2><p></p><p>My first ereader was the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2009-02-26-amazon-kindle-2-review.html\">Kindle 2</a> with buttons everywhere, including a full keyboard \u2013 that was too many.

It has the same streamlined interface as the Clara 2E, including an easy setup and intuitive navigation. You basically get everything that\u2019s great about a Kobo device in a package that looks and feels premium.</p><p>One side of the reader has a wider bezel for the buttons and the screen rotates nearly instantly when you reorient the device, meaning you could have the buttons on the left, right or even bottom. Plus, if you want to lock the orientation when you\u2019ve finally decided on a position, it\u2019s a simple two-tap process. The wider bezel is also slightly thicker and slopes up at the edge, giving it a secure handhold. And I haven\u2019t even mentioned the textured, rubberized back. All together, the Libra is the most comfortable ereader I've ever held.</p><p>At seven inches, the screen is only a little bigger than the standard Kindle or Kobo Clara 2E, but I noticed the difference. Out of all the ereaders I tried, reading the Libra 2 most closely resembles reading a physical paperback, especially after you balance the warm and cool light. But a paperback won\u2019t adjust font size with a pinch or get brighter when you slide a finger along the margin like the Libra 2 will. The text and image clarity is nearly the best of the bunch \u2013 only the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Qb2NrZXRib29rLUdsYXJlLUZyZWUtRXllLUZyaWVuZGx5LVRvdWNoLVNjcmVlbi1UZWNobm9sb2d5L2RwL0IwQjU2VFkzQ1k_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tcjEtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUxZGNjYmNkLWFjNjUtNGZjMC05OWQzLTZkOWNkMzg5YWNiMSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAejK3RW8C3I2NfcYkoKBOjCWnEl397Ljr2xQyZfOT2Lb&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPocketbook-Glare-Free-Eye-Friendly-Touch-Screen-Technology%2Fdp%2FB0B56TY3CY\">PocketBook Era</a> was crisper. (That device also has a beautiful build. Unfortunately, the software doesn\u2019t yet match the aesthetics.)</p><p>The Libra 2\u2019s larger screen tempted me to use a few of Kobo\u2019s bonus features found in the More section of the main navigation. The web browser is in beta, and it displays simple websites easily, if slowly. The <a href=\"https://getpocket.com/login?src=web-client\">Pocket</a> integration lets you save articles from the web and then read them from the comfort of your Kobo. I used Martha Wells\u2019 Murderbot Diaries as fodder for this testing and one entry is only available as a short story on <em>Wired</em>. I saved the article via the web extension on my laptop, then opened it up on the Kobo. I could then read it like it was any other part of the series.</p><p>At $190, the Libra 2 is one of the more expensive ereaders. But if you\u2019re a voracious reader looking for a luxe experience, you won\u2019t do much better than this.

The tablet runs on a fork of Android 11 and doesn\u2019t hold your hand getting set up. The only books available through the onboard \u201cstore\u201d are free public domain classics. However, you can do far more with the Leaf 2 than you can with any standard ereader.</p><p>After enabling Google Play, I searched for and downloaded apps much like on a smartphone or tablet. I even grabbed ereader apps from other manufacturers, including Kobo and Kindle, and installed Libby to read books I had borrowed from the library. Through the built-in Neo web browser, I downloaded Project Gutenberg files, reading them with Boox\u2019s Neo reader. Via BooxDrop, I wirelessly transferred a few ePubs I had on my computer. In short, if there's an ebook you want to read, you can do so on the Leaf 2 in some way.</p><p>The device itself looks similar to Kobo\u2019s Libra 2 with a wider side bezel housing two page turn buttons. Those buttons are programmable, as are most touchscreen gestures. In fact, \u201ccustomizable\u201d might be the best way to describe the Leaf 2. In addition to a dizzying amount of options built into the operating system, other <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Onyx_Boox/\">Boox users</a> have created APK files to tweak and improve your experience.</p><p>The Leaf 2 has a soft, adjustable front light with temperature control and a flush, glare-free screen. The display is as speedy as can be expected with E Ink, and the overall UI is simple enough for anyone familiar with Android to master. The ever-present nav ball is a small, on-screen button that lets you access a few quick functions, and this is the only device we tried with a built-in speaker (yes, it can play Spotify).</p><p>Tech that requires somewhat advanced knowledge often gathers devoted fans, and Boox devices are no different. Get one and you\u2019ll join a club that laughs at proprietary ebook hurdles. You\u2019ll also have tons of possibilities to divert yourself with when you want to do something other than read.</p><h3>Boox Leaf 2</h3><ul><li><p>Screen size: 7\u201d</p></li><li><p>Resolution: 300dpi</p></li><li><p>Capacity: 32GB</p></li><li><p>Waterproof rating: None</p></li><li><p>Warm light: Yes</p></li></ul>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-ereader-130013808.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-ereader-130013808.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-08-23T16:51:10.889341+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Solo Stove cuts up to 40 percent off the price of its fire pits for Labor Day", "description": "<p>Solo Stove might just come to your aid if you're hoping for a smoke-free fire in your backyard (or at the beach) this Labor Day weekend.

Before becoming a household name in gaming circles, he cut his teeth working on the studio\u2019s long-running Armored Core series, serving as a planner on 2005\u2019s <em>Armored Core: Last Raven</em> and then as director on <em>Armored Core IV </em>and <em>Armored Core:</em><em>For Answer</em>.</p><p>Following the success of <em>Demon\u2019s Souls</em> and <em>Dark Souls</em>, FromSoftware went on to release two more <em>Armored Core </em>games, though Miyazaki wasn\u2019t directly involved in those projects. Since then, the studio has been busy building on the Souls series, culminating with the runaway success of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/elden-ring-has-sold-more-than-20-million-copies-215824304.html\"><em><ins>Elden Ring</ins></em></a>. Now, for the first time in nearly a decade, From is revisiting its mech franchise. <em>Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon</em> also marks the directorial debut of one of the studio\u2019s most promising up-and-coming talents \u2014 Masaru Yamamura the lead game designer on <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, </em>and a designer on <em>Bloodborne</em>. <em>Armored Core VI </em>is not a Soulslike, but a lot of its best ideas feel informed by <em>Sekiro </em>and <em>Bloodborne</em>. And if it\u2019s any indication of what\u2019s to come, Yamamura has a long career ahead of him as one of the studio\u2019s premier directors.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>If you\u2019re reading this review, there\u2019s a good chance that, like me, you haven\u2019t played an Armored Core game before. Even at its peak, the series never enjoyed the kind of global popularity Dark Souls achieved in the span of five years. But if you\u2019re curious if there\u2019s something here for you, the short answer is a resounding yes. However, as with almost all of From\u2019s games, a little \u2014 okay, a lot \u2014 of patience goes a long way.</p><p>Here\u2019s the thing you need to know about <em>Armored Core VI: </em>It is uncompromising. Like <em>Sekiro </em>before it, prepare to be frustrated until you wrap your head around how Yamamura wants you to approach combat. I\u2019ll admit, I died about a dozen times to <em>Armored Core VI\u2019s</em> first boss, which appears at the start of the game before I managed to eke out a victory. Even then, it took me several more hours before I felt like I had a narrow grasp of <em>AC 6\u2019s </em>interlocking weapon, piloting and mech assembly systems.</p><div id=\"50179921db5c44a19c30137ba6449c7b\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>Part of what makes From\u2019s latest so<em>&nbsp;</em>intimidating is that there\u2019s so much going on all at once. To give you a sense of the complexity involved, the game's mechs \u2014 called Armored Cores \u2014 can carry up to four weapons, and fire them independently of one another. Moreover, there are dozens of different weapons archetypes, each with its own set of tactical considerations. Missile pods, for instance, fire a salvo of rockets either at a single target or multiple enemies simultaneously. Since most feature a lengthy reload or cooldown animation, you can\u2019t rely on any one weapon alone to win an encounter. Each requires thoughtful consideration and use, all while keeping a hulking robot skillfully evading fire.</p><p>Movement is everything in <em>AC6</em>. Armored Cores have three different boosts available: one to increase their regular traversal speed, one to dash away from attacks and one that allows them to catapult themselves at enemies and quickly cover a lot of ground. They can also jump, and ignite their boosters to fly.</p><p>All of an AC\u2019s more advanced movement abilities consume energy, which is represented by a bar along the bottom of the interface. Landing on the ground will begin to quickly replenish that resource. Most enemies don\u2019t have anywhere near the mobility of the player\u2019s mech, but some can hit hard if they\u2019re allowed to land a shot. There\u2019s also a stagger mechanic within the game that applies to both the player and opponents. One difference between <em>AC6</em> and From\u2019s Soulsborne games is that dashing doesn\u2019t give invincibility frames. As a newbie to the series, the need to consider spacing on top of reacting quickly added to the game\u2019s learning curve.</p><p>Since you\u2019re not tied to the ground like you would be in <em>Dark Souls</em> or <em>Bloodborne</em>, combat is far more vertical than in any of From\u2019s other recent games. A lot of enemies have access to wide, horizontal sweeping attacks that you can\u2019t avoid through lateral movement. Conversely, gaining the high ground on opponents is often the most effective way to dispatch them. Knowing when to take to the air is probably the most important skill to grasp in AC6, and, if you\u2019re a Soulsborne veteran, likely the most difficult to learn as well.</p><p>How nimble an Armored Core is depends on the parts it\u2019s built from, and with hundreds of options to choose from, there\u2019s a lot of room for creativity. Some offer simple stat boosts while others change how a mech travels across the battlefield. For example, a set of quadruped legs allow an AC to hover in the air without consuming energy, a feature that\u2019s useful for missions that require a lot of aerial combat. By contrast, a mech with tank treads isn\u2019t great at getting off the ground, but it can drift after dashing and charge up a weapon without stopping.</p><div id=\"77681e5f5e1c40949bf463af4ae14c65\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>Like I said, there\u2019s a lot to learn and unpack. Thankfully, <em>Armored Core VI </em>is also one of FromSoftware\u2019s more accessible games. After the initial hurdle of the first boss, the first few missions that follow are smaller in scale, and feature less formidable enemies. At the same time, the game offers training missions that are there to illuminate the finer points of <em>Armored Core VI\u2019s </em>mechanics. At most, these take a few minutes to complete, and provide useful mech parts as rewards. It\u2019s a structure I felt eased me into the game before throwing harder challenges my way.</p><p>Yamamura and company have also wisely done away with some of the series\u2019 more hardcore elements. Past games featured a system that allowed the player to go into debt if they didn\u2019t play well. That\u2019s not something that\u2019s present in <em>AC6</em>. I found I always had spare funds to modify my mech, thanks to the amount of credits the game doled out for completing missions and the ability to replay them for even more money. It also helps that every component available to purchase can be sold for the same price it costs to buy it. As a result, I found I was free to experiment with different loadouts to find the combination that suited my playstyle without having to consider a punishing in-game economy.</p><p>AC6\u2019s mission structure also does a lot of heavy lifting to make the game more approachable. The inclusion of a checkpoint system meant I never lost much, if any, progress when I died (and I died a lot in my early hours). It\u2019s also possible to modify a mech between deaths without restarting a mission. Unless I was chasing an \u2018S\u2019 ranking when replaying a mission, that meant I was free to use one mech to reach a boss and another to defeat it. In fact, the game encouraged me to do exactly that after dying multiple times in a row to one boss I encountered midway through chapter one.</p><p>Still, there were some frustrations. Boss battles felt overly difficult relative to every other enemy, perhaps to balance the game\u2019s checkpoint system. Most opponents \u2014 including opposing Armored Cores \u2014 have a limited pool of attacks. Bosses throw out that script. To give you one example, Balteus, the final boss of the game\u2019s first chapter, starts with a moveset that consists of about a dozen attacks, a few of which flood the arena with homing missiles. When the battle enters its second phase, Balteus\u2019s moveset doubles and the boss becomes even more aggressive. It\u2019s a punishing encounter and a brick wall of an early-game skill check.</p><p>Sometimes the controls also don\u2019t feel up to the task of what <em>AC6</em> is asking you to pull off. It\u2019s especially noticeable if you go with what\u2019s known in-game as a \u201cdouble trigger\u201d build, which involves equipping an Armored Core with a pair of weapons that ideally should be fired in unison.</p><div id=\"2549dba506d64aa38deebfe0ec9b168b\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>By default, <em>Armored Core VI</em> maps all of a mech\u2019s weapons to left and right triggers, alongside the bumper buttons. The right analog stick, meanwhile, controls the camera and the square or X button is for dashing. The game includes a target assist mode that locks the camera to a single target, but it\u2019s not ideal to use when fighting more than one enemy. When I felt I struggled the most, it was because I had to give up control of the camera to boost away from an attack. It\u2019s possible to remap the controls, but I didn\u2019t find a configuration that worked as well as the default setup.</p><p>Those frustrations aside, I never felt like <em>Armored Core VI </em>was anything short of compelling. Even in its most challenging moments, the game gave me little victories to celebrate. It is an incredible achievement in game design and thematic cohesion, and, I think, a promise of what we can expect from FromSoftware\u2019s next generation of talent.</p><p><em>Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon </em>arrives on PlayStation, Xbox and PC<em>&nbsp;</em>on August 25th.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/armored-core-vi-fires-of-rubicon-review-fromsoftware-mech-game-150015742.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/armored-core-vi-fires-of-rubicon-review-fromsoftware-mech-game-150015742.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-08-23T15:46:08.258590+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Ex-OpenSea employee receives prison sentence for NFT insider trading", "description": "<p>Former <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/opensea/\">OpenSea</a> employee Nathanial Chastain has been sentenced to three months in prison over an <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/nft/\">NFT</a> (non-fungible token) insider trading scheme.

Sony claims that it's one of the first companies to offer consumer earbuds with this tech, which it says delivers &quot;an audiophile-level listening experience normally found in premium headphones for professional sound engineers.&quot;</p><figure><img alt=\"Sony's Pulse Elite headphones for PlayStation 5.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/651b9e70-41bc-11ee-afff-8569ad4fb5b4\" style=\"height: 772px; width: 1119px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sony Interactive Entertainment</div></figure><p>The Pulse Explore earbuds have dual mics and &quot;AI-enhanced noise rejection&quot; to filter out background noise. Naturally, they come with a charging case. The Pulse Elite has similar tech for handling background audio, along with a retractable boom mic. Sony is bundling in a charging hangar for the headphones too.</p><p>The company hasn't announced a release date for either device, other than to say it will announce those details soon. Be warned, though: the Pulse Explore earbuds are fairly pricey. They cost the same as the PlayStation Portal remote player in the US, UK, Europe and Japan.

The upcoming <a href=\"https://www.corsair.com/newsroom/press-release/elevate-your-workspace-corsair-announces-platform6-modular-computer-desk\">Corsair Platform:6 Modular Computer Desk</a> falls firmly in the latter category thanks to its six-foot wide surface, additional one foot by two and a third feet in extensions and further customizable options.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/corsair-expands-its-mechanical-keyboards-by-acquiring-drop-160524368.html\">Corsair</a>'s Platform:6 is a good option if you want a variety of features all from the same place \u2014 no cobbling around parts from different companies. Seriously, this desk might as well team up with Hasbro and learn to defend the planet because it would fit right in.

Android users on the other hand have a ton of makes and models to consider. So when you get a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-android-phone-130030805.html\">new Android device</a>, it\u2019s not always clear how to take a screenshot. For most, you can either use the physical buttons on the handset, or ask your handy virtual assistant to take one for you. Whether you have a Samsung, Google, Motorola or phone, here\u2019s how to take a screenshot on (almost) any Android device.</p><h2>How to take a screenshot using physical buttons</h2><p>Most Android devices have a power button and volume key \u2014 phones and tablets alike. In order to take a screenshot on most of these, press the Power button and Volume Down button at the same time. The screen will flash and a preview of the screenshot will appear at the bottom right corner. The image will go straight to your designated screenshots folder.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h2>How to take a screenshot using gestures</h2><p>While your Android phone may not have them turned on by default, you can use hand gestures to take a screenshot on many devices. On Samsung devices, turn on Palm Swipe to capture and then run your hand across the screen to take the screenshot.</p><p>Google Pixel phones (starting from the Pixel 4a 5G and newer) have a gesture called Quick Tap. This allows you to perform certain tasks just by double tapping the back of the handset. To find it, go to Settings, scroll down to System and select Gestures. Hit \u201cQuick Tap to start actions\u201d and toggle the switch to activate Quick Tap. This feature will default to taking screenshots, but you can change it to a number of other actions if you want.</p><figure><img alt=\"How to take a screenshot on an Android device\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/915811e0-4030-11ee-b7ff-ac8b33ec2600\" style=\"height: 1700px; width: 1800px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Julia Mercado / Engadget</div></figure><h2>How to screenshot using a virtual assistant</h2><p>Samsung\u2019s Bixby and the Google Assistant can take screenshots for you. Just say \u201cHey, Google\u201d or \u201cHi, Bixby\u201d and instruct them to take a screenshot. On Google devices, you will automatically get the option to share the image on any app of your choice. For Bixby users, you can instruct the assistant to share via a specific app by saying \u201cHi, Bixby. Take a screenshot and share it on Instagram,\u201d and the like.</p><h2>How to take a scrolling screenshot</h2><p>Both Samsung and Google have built-in ways to take a scrollable screenshot. This means you no longer have to take multiple images of one, long webpage to share with your friends. To take a scrolling screenshot, press the Power button and Volume Down at the same time, then a preview of the screenshot will appear at the bottom left.</p><p>On Google devices, it will give you the option to \u201ccapture more.\u201d On Samsung phones, there will be an arrow pointing down. When you tap that, you will get a preview of the entire page where you can adjust the edges to include what you want.</p><figure><img alt=\"How to take a screenshot on an Android device\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/a3f11e00-4030-11ee-b7dd-d528a8a8aba6\" style=\"height: 1700px; width: 1800px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Julia Mercado / Engadget</div></figure><h2>A bonus for Samsung users</h2><p>Samsung devices that come with an S Pen can take a screenshot using the stylus like a remote. Take out the S Pen, press and hold its button for at least three seconds and wait for the screen to flash. From there you can edit your image, annotating it with the pen or cropping it to your liking.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/how-to-take-a-screenshot-on-android-120035005.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/how-to-take-a-screenshot-on-android-120035005.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-08-23T12:32:28.669110+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Samsung's 57-inch ultrawide dual 4K gaming monitor arrives in October for $2,500", "description": "<p>The logical next step for widescreen gaming monitors is a model that can display the equivalent of two UHD (3,840 x 2,160) screens \u2014 and Samsung <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-ces-monitors-8k-57-inch-ultra-wide-odyssey-150046205.html\">teased just such a thing</a> earlier this year at CES 2023.

The end-to-end encryption (E2EE) standard, which <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/meta-testing-default-end-to-end-encryption-messenger-131733068.html\">first arrived a year ago</a>, will be available as standard to all users by the end of 2023.

With E2EE, though, the app itself visits the shared URL, pulls the relevant image and text information, then sends it. That slows the process down a touch, but it means users still get a full feature set but with the privacy of encryption.&nbsp;</p><p>Meta said it's also testing on-device recovery for encrypted chats, requiring users to set up a PIN or generate a code. It's also trialing an option to save chats on cloud storage services like iCloud. Meanwhile, Meta will complete its E2EE trifecta by also enabling it for Instagram DMs by the end of 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>That will effectively catch the company up to services like Signal, bringing end-to-end encryption fully into the mainstream.

According to <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-4-season-2-called-season-of-blood-adds-vampire-hunter-companion\"><em>IGN</em></a>, Rod Fergusson, who oversees the development of the franchise, players will get vampire powers and will face against a vampire lord in the new questline during the opening night of Gamescom 2023. Season 2 of the online action role-playing game is called &quot;Season of Blood,&quot; because yes, it does feature vampires.&nbsp;</p><p>Gemma Chan, actor and producer who starred in <em>Eternals</em> and <em>Crazy Rich Asians</em>, voices the vampire hunter companion Erys, who leads the fight against the new threat in the game's universe. The new season will also feature five new and returning endgame bosses, as well as updates to renown rewards, gem and stash storage, making it so that gems no longer take up space, as well as to resistance and status effects.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The main <em>Diablo IV</em> storyline that came out earlier this year featured a tale that takes place decades after the end of <em>Diablo III: Reaper of Souls</em>. It puts the player in the shoes of a wanderer who, due to certain circumstances, must now go after Lilith. That's the daughter of Mephisto, who was prominently featured in <em>Diablo II </em>as one of the Prime Evils the player must defeat. <em>Diablo IV</em> became the best-selling game in June when it came out, and Fergusson said the game, with the first season that's still ongoing, boasts 12 million players.&nbsp;</p><p>We'll have to wait and see if the second season will add more players to that number.
