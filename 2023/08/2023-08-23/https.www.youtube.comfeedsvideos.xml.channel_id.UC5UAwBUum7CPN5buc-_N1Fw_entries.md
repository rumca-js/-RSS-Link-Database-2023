My laptop and my desktop run Fedora workstation 38 with GNOME 44. 

For my servers, I have one running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. It's used for my Nextcloud server, it's hosted on Linode, and it's the backbone of all my digital life and the channel. My other server is used to host my podcast, the Linux and Open SOurce News podcast. That server is hosted on Linode, and runs Debian 11.

I also run HoloISO on a PC in my living room, that serves as my Linux gaming console.


First thing is Nextcloud. As I said, it's installed as a Snap, and it works beautifully. I don't get the updates as soon as they're out, but when I do get them, they're very well tested and I never had any issues with it. I'm currently on version 26.0.4, so Nextcloud Hub 4, not 5.

I mostly use Nextcloud as the platform to handle all my online accounts. It hosts my calendar, contacts, tasks, photos, notes, RSS feeds, passwords, and I also use it to share files with sponsors, or to share the link to the weekly patroncast I make for patrons and youtube members.

My other server hosts my podcast, using YUNOHOST and their Castopod app. Yunohost is a very simple, graphical dashboard to run one or many server applications, it basically just simplifies hosting stuff and has pre packaged apps to install stuff in one click.

To interact with other Nextcloud related stuff, I use a few apps. The first one is Iotas, it's a GTK application that plugs into Nextcloud notes and lets you take, well, notes, in simple, distraction free markdown. For RSS feeds, I use Newsflash, which is another GTK app.

I also, of course, use the Nextcloud desktop client to sync all my files to and from my computers, plus the Nautilus Nextcloud integration so I can generate a shared link for any file straight from the file manager. For tasks, I use Endeavour.

And on my phone, I also use the Nextcloud app to send all my photos automatically from my phone to a folder that is then synced to all my computers, and I use the official Nextcloud Notes app to have access to my scripts while I'm recording.

For audio, I use Audacity. It looks like crap, it's very old, but it does the trick, it has the 3 effects I need, a noise reduction tool, a compressor, and a normalizing tool.

For my thumbnails, it's obviously GIMP. It has a bad reputation among people who are familiar with photoshop, but as I've never used that thing, GIMP is really easy to use for me

And for recording my screen, it's OBS on every device.

When I happen upon an image I want to use that uses a format Resolve doesn't support, like WebP or AVIF, I use Converter to convert it to PNG.  For converting video files, I use ffmpeg in a terminal.

And when I need to re download one of my old videos that I didn't backup, I use Parabolic.

Now for a few smaller utilities. FOr virtual machines, I generally run them using GNOME Boxes, because it's really simple.

For my backups, I use Pika Backup. I also use Safing's portmaster. For editing text, I generally just use Nano in a terminal.

For music, I use YTM Music, because I pay for Youtube Premium to avoid ads on my TV, and it comes with a music streaming service, so might as well use it.


I won't talk much about the web browser, it's Firefox everywhere, even on my phone.

For my office suite, I use LIbreOffice, everyone knows about it.

For email and calendar, I moved to Thunderbird, seeing as version 115 is absolutely wonderful and well designed.
