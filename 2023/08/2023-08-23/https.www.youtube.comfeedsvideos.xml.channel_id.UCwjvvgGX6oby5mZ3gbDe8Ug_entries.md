First, let's have a look at a recent trade show in Shanghai. It was for household goods. To the surprise of the booth vendors, there isnâ€™t much traffic, not to mention foreigners. According to China's official data, in 2020, the number of foreigners working in Shanghai was 215,000, accounting for 23.7% of the total foreign population, ranking first nationwide.
The decline in the number of foreigners is particularly noticeable in major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. If concerns were previously seen in investment and jobs, there is now a clear sign of it in tourism.
