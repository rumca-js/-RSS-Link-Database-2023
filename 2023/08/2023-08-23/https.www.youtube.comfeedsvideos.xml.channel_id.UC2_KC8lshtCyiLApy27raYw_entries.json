AI!\n\nThat sounds like a good idea, right?\n\nLike, first we replace the Hollywood people, then we go for, I don\u2019t know, McDonalds workers, then Menards employees, and then just everybody else.\n\nI mean it sounds like a win win to me.\n\nNobody has to work, and the robots will actually get my Big Mac order right.
