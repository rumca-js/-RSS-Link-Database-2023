Well Hollywood people are striking, they want “money”.

This got me thinking, what if we just stopped paying people to do work, and replaced them, with robots? AI!

That sounds like a good idea, right?

Like, first we replace the Hollywood people, then we go for, I don’t know, McDonalds workers, then Menards employees, and then just everybody else.

I mean it sounds like a win win to me.

Nobody has to work, and the robots will actually get my Big Mac order right. I said no lettuce!
