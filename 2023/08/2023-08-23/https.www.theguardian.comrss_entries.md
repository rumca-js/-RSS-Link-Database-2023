So, 16 days from the World Cup they have spent the past four years preparing for, England arrive at their final warm-up game against Fiji on Saturday sixth in the world rankings, shepherded by a new coaching team who are on a run of three wins in seven, steeled by a defence conceding an average of four tries a game, sharpened by an attack that has scored that amount in their past 400 minutes and led by a captain – and starting fly-half – who is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/22/owen-farrell-england-rugby-world-cup" title="">banned from playing in two of their four group games</a>.

Could be it is the other teams in the group – Argentina, Japan, Samoa and Chile – quaking in their training boots because England are about to launch the most elaborate rope-a-dope since Muhammad Ali came out swinging in the eighth. Could be it is a couple of loose chariot wheels tumbling off down the hill. Or maybe it is just the resonant voice of the Rugby Football Union chief executive, Bill Sweeney. “Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair.” Or: “Some things weren’t quite clicking,” as Sweeney said after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/06/eddie-jones-sacked-as-england-rugby-union-head-coach" title="">the RFU sacked Eddie Jones </a>in December. “They weren’t working the way we all thought they were going to work.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/23/steve-borthwick-unconvincing-england-result-rfu-botched-plan-rugby-union">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘It’s not black and white’: is Carlos Ghosn a victim or a villain?

<p>A new four-part Apple TV+ docu-series charts the rise and fall of former Nissan and Renault boss turned disgraced international fugitive</p><p>It has been said in newspapers, cable news and by the wanted man himself: Carlos Ghosn’s story was made for the screen. The disgraced former Nissan and Renault boss’s escape from Japan while awaiting trial for alleged financial misconduct in December 2019 seemed like a sequence ripped from a Hollywood heist film – a meticulously arranged <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/31/carlos-ghosn-escaped-japan-hiding-in-a-musical-instrument-case">plot involving an audio equipment box</a>, a private jet and a close call with Japanese airport security. Its success was an embarrassment for Japanese authorities and the subject of both international consternation and intrigue.</p><p>Wanted: The Escape of Carlos Ghosn, a new docuseries from Apple TV+, does indeed dramatize the plot (including Ghosn’s POV in the box, scrunched in the dark with holes poked for air) with commentary from Ghosn and his smugglers: Mike Taylor, a Massachusetts-based ex-Green Beret with ties to Lebanon and, to a lesser extent, his son Peter. (Both Taylors were later extradited and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jul/19/carlos-ghosn-us-father-and-son-jailed-in-tokyo">convicted in Japan</a>, where they served nearly two years in solitary confinement, while Ghosn <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/nov/20/the-story-is-very-rich-ghosns-escape-to-freedom-has-come-at-a-cost">remained free in Lebanon</a>, which has no extradition treaty; the tension from such reversed fates animates the final episode of the series.) But over four episodes, the Apple series, based on the book Boundless: The Rise, Fall and Escape of Carlos Ghosn by the Wall Street Journal reporters Nick Kostov and Sean McLain, also explores the vast, murky terrain of international megawealth, corporate intrigue and shady financial dealings. Ghosn, who has dismissed the charges in Japan as a conspiracy to prevent his merger of Nissan with Renault, still faces an arrest warrant from France alleging misuse of corporate funds and money laundering, among other financial crimes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/aug/23/carlos-ghosn-docu-series-apple-tv">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Conservative fixation on shrinking the state is fiscally reckless and detached from political reality </p><p>Just as every problem resembles a nail to someone equipped only with a hammer, the faintest glint of good economic news entices Conservative MPs to call for tax cuts. Earlier this week, <a href="https://obr.uk/docs/dlm_uploads/July-PSF-commentary.pdf" title="">new data</a> showed that government borrowing in the second quarter of the year was £11.3bn lower than had previously been forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). The windfall is explained by higher revenues. That in turn is largely a function of frozen income tax thresholds – a stealthy tax rise that scoops more people into the higher rate as their earnings increase.</p><p>Tory MPs have not hesitated to call for cuts. Most frame the argument in terms of economic stimulus – the conviction that growth will be restored as people spend money that would otherwise have been deducted from their pay. Iain Duncan Smith made an auxiliary motive explicit: “If the economy is not growing we will lose the election,” <a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/rishi-sunak-jeremy-hunt-pressure-cut-taxes-public-finances-boost-2563886" title="">the former Tory leader said</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/23/the-guardian-view-on-tory-mps-and-tax-cuts-the-desperate-demanding-the-delusional">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A relaxed Ian Foster adopts the perfect tone when discussing Steve Hansen before New Zealand’s final World Cup warm-up</p><p>In New Zealand they are still slowly processing the idea of Steve Hansen, their former World Cup-winning coach, agreeing to help Australia in the lead-up to the World Cup. Even within the All Blacks camp itself, the jokes are starting to fly. “There must be something in it for him – or he lost a bet,” the lock forward Scott Barrett said drily, when asked to respond to this week’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/22/steve-hansen-wallabies-defection-new-zealand-all-blacks-prime-minister-chris-hipkins">unlikely sounding news</a>.</p><p>Ian Foster, the current All Black head coach, was also ready for the inevitable questions and rifled a decent backhand past his inquisitors at the Lensbury Club in Teddington. “Outstanding,” Foster replied. “He’s agreed to give me three pages of notes about what’s going on [with them]. I’ve got no issues. We might bring him in for a couple of days ourselves.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/23/all-blacks-ian-foster-world-cup-warm-up">Continue reading...</a>

## America on trial: the charges against Trump will decide the fate of a nation | Martin Kettle

<p>The US has no precedents for a former president in the dock, but there are echoes of France’s pursuit of Marshal Pétain</p><p>History teaches us few wider lessons. But there are rare exceptions. One of these is that for a nation to put its former leaders on trial is never straightforward. Although such cases are rare, when they do occur they frequently involve the pushing of pre-existing legal boundaries and the reshaping of constitutional norms and assumptions. The evolution of the doctrine of crimes against humanity after the Nuremberg trials in 1945 is the most significant modern example of this.</p><p>Both at the time they occur and subsequently, the arguments that surround trials of this kind are almost inescapably political to a significant degree. That was true of the trial and execution of Charles I in 1649, an event that divided England then; and some of those divisions of the 17th century can still be felt today. But it will unquestionably also be true of the trials of the former US president Donald Trump, of which the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/22/donald-trump-surrender-fulton-county-jail-thursday-night">latest step</a> is due to be taken in Atlanta on Thursday.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/23/america-trial-charges-donald-trump-us-president">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Snyder’s epic-looking Netflix effort comes complete with lightsabers and exotic space princesses. Can it revive a neglected style of film-making?</p><p>For a genre that pretty much inspired the entire blockbuster era, space opera has become weirdly hard to get hold of beyond Star Wars. After the original trilogy’s barnstorming success in the late 70s for Lucasfilm, there were umpteen abortive attempts by other studios to grab themselves some of that good space fantasy dollar, but nobody really got anywhere useful. Disney’s appalling The Black Hole is barely remembered these days, while Roger Corman’s Battle Beyond the Stars is perhaps memorable only for giving a certain James Cameron an early break on special effects. There was even a James-Bond-in-space movie, Roger Moore’s Moonraker, although it hardly registers as one of 007’s most scintillating adventures.</p><p>Flash forward to the present day, and space opera seems to have become the preserve of the small screen, thanks to Disney+’s endlessly satisfying conveyor belt of Star Wars spin-offs and retreads. We are promised <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/11/star-wars-the-cinematic-empire-prepares-to-strike-back">more movies set in a galaxy far, far away</a>, but there are no definitive start dates for production and certainly no mooted release dates.

<p>The cult singer is still living off Whole Wide World, his very first song – and it wasn’t even a hit. As the riotous raconteur releases a new album, he talks bloody marys, brake failures and near death by Covid</p><p>As Eric Goulden concedes, the last few years have been rather a mixed bag. On the plus side, his most famous song, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUFL8WSxTgY">Whole Wide World</a>, enjoyed yet another of its periodic leases of life. It was the first song he ever released, in 1977, one of a succession of classic punk-era singles that came out on the celebrated indie label Stiff. It didn’t make the charts but, thereafter, Whole Wide World simply refused to go away. It’s been covered by everyone from the Monkees to the Proclaimers to Green Day. It’s been translated into Italian and Finnish. And it has appeared on umpteen movie soundtracks – Will Ferrell sang it in Stranger Than Fiction.</p><p>This time, it turned up on a TV ad for travel company Expedia, starring Ewan McGregor. The commercial debuted during 2022’s Super Bowl, which was watched by 200 million people, with the inevitable knock-on effect: Whole Wide World’s streaming figures soared to over 16.3m on Spotify, 16m more than everything else Goulden has released in the intervening 46 years. “It’s fantastic,” he enthuses. “I mean, I could get very churlish and moan about it – ‘I’ve got all these other songs!’ And I have done in the past – ‘It was all downhill after that! I’m so much more than that!’ But thank God, because without it, I’m dead in the water.

Or, he could look at the statistics for 23-24 and note that, despite the Orwellian imposition of footballers being asked to actually play football for more than just over 50% of the advertised time, ball in play time in 23-24 in League Two is still just 56 minutes.

Ever since he’d returned from holiday in Santa Monica Rishi Sunak had been overwhelmed with a sense of despair. A futility no number of sessions on his Peloton could erase. He was meant to be living his best life. The tech-bro turned prime minister. The man who fell to Earth to save the UK from Boris Johnson and Liz Truss. Where was the gratitude for all he had done? At best, the country was totally indifferent to his efforts. At worst it was hostile.</p><p>Now he was reduced to ever more meaningless photo ops with people bewildered to know why he was there. It wasn’t as if he had anything new to say. How much longer could he go on announcing things that were probably never going to happen? Even he was struggling to believe in himself. Even he could see he was at his best when he was doing nothing.

<p>‘This trio are celebrating the Notting Hill carnival with a dance called daggering which is common in Jamaica. This bus stop has now been altered – to stop people mounting it during the carnival’</p><p>Technically, the first time I was at the Notting Hill carnival was in 1990. My mum went there when she was pregnant with me. I started going properly, though, when I was seven or eight. The first time I photographed it was 2014 but I messed up and didn’t get any shots. So I really went for it the next year. I was in the thick of the action. I’d just come from a confined space, almost like a mosh pit. As I stumbled out, I saw a group of youngsters climbing on top of a bus stop. I had to anticipate what was coming next. I needed to change lenses, which wasn’t ideal. As the trio on the left started moving, I bent down, put a different lens on, and started photographing.</p><p>It all happened so fast. I have no idea who the three people are. To this day, I’ve never been able to identify them. They’re just people celebrating carnival. What they are doing is called daggering, a form of dancing in the Caribbean. It usually has a run-up and a jump, then a dancing motion. It’s very common in Jamaican dancehall. This was an extreme version, performed on the top of a bus stop. They have since changed those bus stops as people would mount them and there were several accidents. This bus stop has been made into a glass one, to stop people getting on top of it during carnival.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/aug/23/extreme-dance-notting-hill-carnival-bus-shelter-emmanuel-coles-best-shot">Continue reading...</a>

Sign up here</a></strong></p><p>For many years, Gamescom was quietly known within the industry as “that other event” – a reference to the utter dominance E3 once enjoyed in the collective consciousness. Taking place in Cologne, it’s a very different beast to its American counterpart, aimed much more at the public (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/aug/22/like-going-to-glastonbury-gamescom-boosts-festival-feel-to-draw-gamers-back">as Keza reports here</a>), and focusing on hands-on demos, rather than endless press conferences. The proof of that could be found in its opening night livestream on Tuesday, a sprawling jamboree of trailers and gameplay clips produced and presented by Geoff Keighley, a one-time journalist, Game Awards organiser and now apparently the only person allowed to make global game events.</p><p>What the night showed is that Gamescom is not quite as slickly stage managed as E3. Keighley was interrupted by stage invaders who demanded the release of GTA 6, and there were awkward segments including an interview with cosplayers. Then Zack Snyder was given several minutes to promote <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rHLOXbFZtI">his forthcoming movie Rebel Moon</a>, which, to be fair, did look more like a video game than a lot of actual video games. And even though plenty of women were on stage, the night had an arch-dudebros-of-the-industry feel, with Todd Howard, Ed Boon, Troy Baker and Phil Spencer popping up, each one seemingly determined to use the exclamation “insane!” more than any previous guest.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/aug/23/pushing-buttons-gamescom-2023-announcements">Continue reading...</a>

It’s a success, too, an hour that touches on shyness, sadness and self-expression, but lightly, joyfully – and very much secondary to pranks, scampering around and administering custard pies to each other’s faces.</p><p>Key to its effectiveness is the sense that the duo (Rachel WD and Ruby Clyde) enjoy their juvenile audience’s company, and the opportunity it affords for a playful, open and uncynical performance. They don’t labour to flog the show to the kids; they let the kids come to them – to their daft physical comedy sketch about wrestling, their capering airport security skit, or their hide-and-seek number about Rachel being shadowed by a – well, I’ll let you find that out for yourself. The disparate parts are held together by running jokes and motifs, like the one about their sketches all tending to the same cheesy conclusion. Or there’s Rachel’s inability to play anyone but herself, and Ruby’s immunity to practical jokes, all of which (mayonnaise on an Oreo; water squirted to the face) are catnip for their kiddie crowd.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/23/shelf-the-kids-show-review-pleasance-courtyard-edinburgh">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Agencies say toxic blue-green algae, thought to be driven by farm runoff and sewage, recorded at levels not seen since 1970s</p><p>Northern Ireland’s Lough Neagh, the largest lake <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Lough-Neagh">in the British Isles</a>, has been hit by recorded levels of potentially toxic blue-green algae that regional agencies say have not been seen since the 1970s.</p><p>Campaigners say the lake is “dying in plain sight” as vast algal blooms choke the aquatic life and bird and insect wildlife plummets. <br /><br />The blooms are thought to be driven by slurry and other runoff from nearby farmland, as well as discharges of human sewage at the body where Northern Ireland sources nearly half of its drinking water. <br /><br />A new study showing that the temperature of the lough’s water has risen 1C since 1995, however, suggests that climate change and clearer waters as a result of an invasive zebra mussel species may also be contributing factors. Environmentalists highlight the additional impacts of industrial sand extraction, activity which has been described as an “outlier” case within Europe by UN experts and which may be redistributing toxins in the lough bed. <br /><br />The lough, which at nearly 400 sq km has a surface area bigger than Malta, and its surrounding wetlands hold a considerable number of domestic and international conservation protections. But campaigners point to a serious lack of regulation and sharply declining wildlife as signs of long-term neglect and unintegrated thinking as regards the lough’s management.<br /><br />A 2013 study by researchers at Queen’s University Belfast found that the number of migratory winter birds had dropped by nearly 80% in a decade. It also highlighted a 66% fall in certain insect and snail species inhabiting the lough bed.<br /><br />“Lough Neagh is dying and it’s dying in plain sight,” said James Orr, Friends of the Earth NI’s director.<br /><br />“So interrelated and long-term are Lough Neagh’s problems that if it were a person it would be described as suffering from multiple organ failure. <br /><br />“How an ecosystem that is so immense, so strategic, so beautiful, so rich in heritage has been ignored, forgotten and abused for decades is the story of wild west exploitation.”<br /><br />About two dozen organisations – spanning devolved government departments, councils and charities – have varying degrees of responsibility for Lough Neagh’s management. But these groups are fragmented and siloed, campaigners say, with there being no agency or body that exercises executive control over the lough.<br /><br />The last major research facility at Lough Neagh, operated mainly by the University of Ulster at Traád Point near Ballyronan along the lough’s north-western shores, closed more than a decade ago.<br /><br />The soil, bed and banks of the lough are owned by the Shaftesbury estate, whose claim to the water body dates back to the Plantation of Ulster in the early 1600s. The current Earl of Shaftesbury, Nicholas Ashley-Cooper, has in recent weeks indicated he would be open to selling the asset.<br /><br />Devolved administrations have explored public ownership of Lough Neagh a number of times since the 1970s, with the most recent bid floundering a decade ago.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/23/lough-neagh-dying-in-plain-sight-say-campaigners-due-to-vast-algal-blooms">Continue reading...</a>

## Grief changes people in different ways’: London drill star Blanco on prison, moral panic and his Portuguese roots

<p>A founder of the influential Harlem Spartans, Blanco was a massive subcultural star before time inside and the loss of his father prompted a search for new musical inspiration</p><p>In 2018, during the two years that Joshua Emmanuel Pinto João Eduardo, or Blanco, spent in prison, he had an epiphany. He decided to move away from making hardened UK drill music – a genre that he’d helped to popularise as a leading architect of the teenage collective Harlem Spartans – and tap into his Portuguese-language roots. “Drill was fun when I was doing it with people, you bounce off each other,” he says. “But doing it by myself, I couldn’t find any passion. I found passion for the Brazilian sound.”</p><p>Losing loved ones while incarcerated had forced him to reflect. When Blanco’s father died in March, he attended the funeral handcuffed to a prison officer. “Going around the coffin with someone who didn’t even know my dad was crazy. My dad always used to say certain things that were important about family. And obviously, in his last moments, I didn’t even get to see him in hospital. That was my fault,” he sighs. His friend Latwaan Griffiths or Latz, a fellow member of Harlem Spartans, was murdered in July 2018. “Prison was a mistake. I didn’t want to go back,” Blanco says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/23/i-found-a-passion-for-brazilian-sound-blanco-the-london-drill-star-inspired-by-his-own-history">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Women’s role in espionage, largely written by women, leans less on explosions and more on perception, nuance and explorations of sacrifice – though they still kick ass</p><p>Spy fiction is a genre of titans: Rudyard Kipling, W Somerset Maugham, John Buchan, Ian Fleming, Graham Greene, Len Deighton, John le Carré. That list will structure most histories of the genre. However, it is only half the picture, reflecting neither the true history of spy fiction nor espionage itself. These authors and their most famous heroes are all male. But for as long as there have been spies, there have been female spies. In the growing espionage machine of the 20th century, we see women in every area, from surveillance and propaganda, to code breaking and cryptography, and agent and double agent. Today’s spy world considers diversity a strategic asset.</p><p>As a child, I bought Fleming’s From Russia With Love in Pan paperback because I wanted to try writing spy fiction. I read Fleming on repeat, falling in love with his characterisation and vivid style. I would make notes on my neighbours – luckily very tolerant people – and turn their movements into mystery stories. In my imaginary games, I wasn’t a “Bond girl” – I was James Bond. I wanted to be the hero, not a supporting character.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/23/top-10-female-spies-in-fiction">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Despite the hatred the Australian attracts, there’s still an air of expectation that hovers around him even as his career continues to stall</p><p>When Australia launch their Fiba World Cup campaign against Finland on Friday, 10 years since Ben Simmons’s last two appearances with the Boomers, they will at last be led by a tall point guard with freakish ball handling skills who’s been hailed as a “generational talent”. But it will be Josh Giddey – 6ft 8in, 20 years old, fresh from two stellar opening seasons with Oklahoma City, and the youngest player in NBA history <a href="https://olympics.com/en/news/oklahoma-city-rookie-josh-giddey-nba-history">to score a triple double</a> – running the Boomers’ offense. Simmons – 6ft 10in, 27, beset by repeated physical and mental setbacks, and the most fined NBA player of all time – <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/37936174/ben-simmons-play-fiba-world-cup-australian-boomers">will miss the World Cup</a> to recover from a nerve impingement in his back.</p><p>Giddey represents the future of Australian basketball. Simmons was the future once, but increasingly it seems he is the past – a past that promised so much and delivered only in fits and starts. In his five full (or full-ish) seasons in the NBA, Simmons has shown all the versatility and durability that was expected of him when he emerged with Louisiana State University: but as a meme rather than as a player. There have been, to be fair, glimpses of the talent that saw the 76ers make him the No 1 overall pick in the 2016 draft: the falcon-like court vision, the power under the boards, that godly passing range and rolling, liquid comfort with the ball in hand. But Simmons has missed two full seasons: the first in 2016-17 thanks to injury, and the second, in 2021-22, owing to a combination of injury and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/oct/05/ben-simmons-holdout-philadelphia-76ers-nba">breakdown of his relationship with 76ers management</a>. Since he was traded to the Nets in early 2022, Simmons has spent most of his time in the treatment room, surrounded by accusations that he is simply too weak for the NBA, a quitter. He earned $35m last season but <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/simmobe01/gamelog/2023">started on the bench towards the end of 2022-23</a> before being shut down due to injury.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/23/ben-simmons-brooklyn-nets-nba-boomers-basketball">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Strawberry ice-cream used to be nearly as common as vanilla, but now seems scarce. Luckily, Felicity may have found the definitive way to make it at home</p><p>I don’t know when strawberry ice-cream started to disappear from freezers, but I suspect some of the blame can be laid at the door of “a couple of old hippies from Vermont”, as the Daily Mirror described Ben and Jerry on the brand’s entry into the UK market back in the mid-1990s. Fruit flavours, it seemed, were out, chocolate cookie dough and nut butter crunch were in, and, 30 years later, it’s surprisingly hard to find a tub of plain old strawberry. In fact, just such a fruitless mission inspired this week’s quest. It’s a shame, too: in my book, all ice-cream is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jul/16/it-feels-sinless-jay-rayner-britain-ice-cream-business-booming">good ice-cream</a>, but there’s something particularly joyful about a pink quiff of strawberry ice: British summer in a sticky, dripping cone. Happily, it’s a lot easier to make than it is to track down in shops.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/aug/23/how-to-make-the-perfect-strawberry-ice-cream-recipe-felicity-cloake">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After a dismal 2022, success has come to Cardiff via increased interaction between the men and women</p><p>BBC viewers will finally get to see Welsh Fire’s women play this weekend. The Cardiff side weren’t allotted a live broadcast from the group games, ironic given they have contributed most of the highlights on their side of the tournament. On Sunday they secured their place in the knockout stages, having lost only one of their first six games, and will now face either Southern Brave or Northern Superchargers – to whom they lost on Tuesday – in Saturday’s eliminator at the Oval.</p><p>Their five wins this season are almost twice as many as they had previously registered in the tournament’s history. Last year brought a single consolatory victory, although that was one more than the men’s side managed.

## Endo can be a success at Liverpool – and a better buy than Caicedo | John Duerden

<p>Midfielder was impressive in Bundesliga and captains Japan but Asian players rarely get the credit they deserve</p><p>Some have suggested it was a panic buy. Sky Sports said that you had to feel for Liverpool’s fans and one UK newspaper talked of “an initial sense of shock mixed with <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2023/08/17/liverpools-18m-signing-wataru-endo-jury-out-jorg-schmadtke/">hints of ridicule and even despair</a>”. It reflects a fairly underwhelming response to Wataru Endo arriving at Anfield. After missing out on Moisés Caicedo the move may have lacked a certain glamour and excitement especially when it involved a 30 year-old player but it also does not help that he is Asian and from a part of the football world still underrated. If Endo had been Argentinian, German or French it is likely there would have been far more fanfare.</p><p>Yet the versatile defensive midfielder is a top-class player, one of the best in the Bundesliga with Stuttgart. In the last two seasons in Germany he won more aerial duels than any other player in his position, had more clearances, more headed clearances and ranked highest for possession won. If that wasn’t impressive enough he was second in terms of touches, tackles and passes. It should also be mentioned that being the captain of a club in one of the big five European leagues – no mean feat for an Asian player given the huge cultural differences they encounter on and off the pitch – shows a certain level of professionalism, leadership and determination.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/23/endo-can-be-a-success-at-liverpool-and-a-better-buy-than-caicedo">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Empire proves a distorting lens through which to view Britain’s fraught history of race relations</p><p>To a certain kind of imperial historian, empire is everywhere. Like latter-day John Hobsons, they believe they alone are keeping alive the anti‑imperial tradition, courageously defying the curmudgeonly nostalgics sipping gin and tonic in the home counties like nabobs of old. But Hobson wrote his famous Imperialism: A Study in 1902, when empire was approaching its zenith and few among his peers counted as anti-imperialist. The same can’t be said of his contemporary heirs.</p><p>“Britain is in denial,” Charlotte Lydia Riley tells us. “The British people as a whole tend to be resistant, when asked outright, about any reappraisal of their nation’s imperial past.” It might be more accurate to say instead that hold-outs like Robert Tombs periodically wax eloquent about the days of the Raj in the Spectator. But the odd apologist apart, polls show that most Britons are indifferent to empire these days; only a third are “proud” of it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/23/imperial-island-by-charlotte-lydia-riley-review-cruel-britannia">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Happy memories are weaponised with lethal consequences in the H Is for Hawk author’s stylish co-written techno-thriller</p><p>Helen Macdonald is best known for their award-winning memoir <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/23/h-is-for-hawk-helen-macdonald-review" title="">H Is for Hawk</a>, which describes training a goshawk after the unexpected death of their father: a haunting, expressive account of grief, raptors and healing. Macdonald’s latest, co-authored with the US writer Sin Blaché, is a very different kind of book: a fast-paced techno-thriller, with a high body count, zippy dialogue and an intriguing central mystery. H Is for High-Octane Adventure, then.</p><p>We might call this book science fiction, although neither of the two fantastical conceits upon which the story is premised is exactly <em>scientific</em>. One is that the protagonist, Sunil Rao, possesses the ability to know whether any given statement is true or false. There are limitations to his power: “emotional states”, he tells us. “There’s a lot of vagueness with those. Can’t track them.” Still, it’s a pretty impressive superpower: “what I <em>can</em> do is judge the veracity of propositional statements about the world. Written, spoken, even implied.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/23/prophet-by-helen-macdonald-and-sin-blache-review-fun-high-octane-sci-fi-thriller">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Despite being an EV convert, fearmongering made me anxious before my holiday. But the summer road trip reaffirmed my faith</p><p>When my son suggested a road trip this summer around the UK and Ireland, I wasn’t sure. He wanted to go from our home in Brighton to Manchester, Edinburgh, Belfast, Dublin, Dingle on Ireland’s west coast, Rosslare on Ireland’s east coast, and Cardiff. We worked out a route and looked at booking hotels, a treehouse, a campervan and a lighthouse; we’d visit friends and family; and we’d explore the capital cities of four nations – it sounded amazing. The only problem was that we’d be doing it in our electric car <strong>– </strong>and it holds less than 100 miles’ worth of charge.</p><p>I’m a convert, but even I was affected by the fearmongering that haunts the electric vehicle market. A <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12257083/DAILY-MAIL-COMMENT-Rethink-rush-ban-petrol-vehicles.html">relentless campaign</a> in the rightwing media against government plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/21/uk-plans-to-bring-forward-ban-on-fossil-fuel-vehicles-to-2030">in 2030</a> reflects the views of an increasingly desperate <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/oct/25/tories-received-13m-from-fossil-fuel-interests-and-climate-sceptics-since-2019">fossil fuels lobby</a>, and I <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/28/leading-the-charge-can-i-make-it-from-lands-end-to-john-ogroats-in-an-electric-car">had read</a> story after <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/cars/1803631/rishi-sunak-petrol-diesel-car-ban-electric-car-charging-bays">story</a> about a lack of working chargers in the UK. I took out a second breakdown policy when I realised that mine covered only one callout in any 28-day period. I expected an adventure, and to come back with tales to tell, like running out of charge halfway up a mountain, or making friends for life with a random farmer as the car took all night to charge on their three-point socket.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/23/uk-ireland-electric-car-electric-vehicle-road-trip">Continue reading...</a>

Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/india">India</a> is looking for a deal that would help improve access for its own manufactured goods and services, as well as work visas.</p><p>It depends what else is in the pot … You wouldn’t rule it out because you might have other interests that made that sensible. There are goods and services that we want to export to India that could create huge wealth in the UK if we got the chance to do that.</p><p>You’ve got to look at these things in the round. You can’t just say, where do we stand on visas without, for example, financial services. Or, for example, whisky exports. What’s in the pot in the round? Take a view of that and ask, ‘Is this deal in the interests of the UK?’ If it is, great. If it’s not, then don’t sign it for the sake of signing one.

<p>She quit Broadway musical of the Lindsay Lohan classic to preserve her mental health and has just released her debut album. It’s a time of high anxiety, the brutally candid songwriter admits</p><p>Snow Angel, the debut album by US musician and actor Reneé Rapp, doesn’t pull its punches. Three songs in, the 23-year-old is airing out an old friend with exaggerated, vitriolic vim: “You’re the worst bitch on earth,” she sings over Poison Poison’s breezy acoustic pop, “I hate you and your guts.”</p><p>Over the course of Snow Angel – which puts her firmly in the realm of emotionally candid young pop singers such as Billie Eilish and Olivia Rodrigo – Rapp also criticises herself and ex-partners, writing raw, sophisticated songs in an attempt to make up for a childhood in which she was told she was “too emotional” by everyone around her. She has long been cursed with “really caring what people think, in a way that does not serve me”, she says. So, whenever she is worried about sending the wrong message with her music, she tries to remember: “I’m not making art to say this is my moral high ground and this is what I believe and agree with – I’m making art to be like, damn, this is what I’m feeling right now.” she says. “That doesn’t mean I’m proud of those feelings, but they are what they are – and that’s just art at the end of the day.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/23/everything-stresses-me-out-renee-rapp-eating-disorder-criticism">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Popular midfielder returns for Europa Conference League playoff to face club he helped win first Scottish Cup in 114 years</p><p>There were 85 minutes on the clock and Aston Villa were already four goals to the good on Sunday when the home crowd burst into another huge cheer. The reason? The sight of John McGinn hotfooting it from one side of the pitch to the other carrying a St John Ambulance medical bag belonging to a paramedic busy treating Philippe Coutinho. A moment that chimed with his character but also his hunger: Villa smelt a fifth. Super John McGinn, indeed, as the terrace chant goes.</p><p>McGinn is guaranteed another rousing reception on Wednesday when the Villa captain returns to Hibernian for the first time as a player, in the first leg of a Europa Conference League play-off. McGinn made his name at Easter Road, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/21/rangers-hibernian-scottish-cup-final-match-report" title="">helping Hibs to secure their first Scottish Cup</a> in 114 years, but has burnished his reputation since a £2.7m switch to Villa five years ago.

While centre-right parties may not have much in the way of ideas to resolve <a href="https://www.phenomenalworld.org/series/the-polycrisis/">Europe’s polycrisis,</a> they do still know how to fight for power. Their instinctive drive for self-preservation means conservatives are radicalising, particularly over issues of race, in order to cut off their insurgent rivals.</p><p>Take France, where the formerly dominant Les Républicains (LR) party has entered a death spiral, with its last presidential candidate, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2022/apr/10/french-election-2022-projected-result-and-latest-results">Valerie Pécresse</a>, failing to reach even the 5% vote threshold required to get her deposit back.

In fact, the self-awareness of Washington’s performance – as crafted and mannered as Olivier playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Critic_(play)">Mr Puff</a> at the Old Vic – is a part of how mesmeric it is, and that final heartstopping twist is a glorious showstopper from Ayer, the screenwriter whose masterpiece this film is. Around the same time, Quentin Tarantino and Roger Avary had been finding a kind of breezy, intoxicating irony and cynicism in violence; Michael Mann revelled in the military discipline and organisation of cops and criminals; Abel Ferrara located a desperate vision of evil in his Bad Lieutenant smoking the crack he had confiscated. But Ayer and Fuqua were doing something more old-fashioned, more rooted in a (distant) belief in due process and crime not paying.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/23/training-day-review-denzel-washingtons-finest-most-sinister-hour">Continue reading...</a>

## Theater Camp review – deeply charming and hilarious stage kid mockumentary

<p>Molly Gordon and Nick Lieberman have made watching bad acting a thrill in this zippy and joke-filled film about jazz-handing theatre kids</p><p>There is a lot of bad acting, in a good way, in Molly Gordon and Nick Lieberman’s deeply charming and very funny mockumentary, set (oddly enough) at a theatre camp in upstate New York. Gordon and Ben Platt play two teachers who met at the camp years ago and became best friends. Just as the summer’s cohort of jazz-handing theatre kids is about to descend, the camp’s redoubtable owner (Amy Sedaris) is dazzled by strobe lights and goes into a coma. This leaves the entire operation in the hands of her tech-bro son (Jimmy Tatro), who drawls that he’s “never really vibed” with the camp, but is just about bright enough to realise it’s in deep trouble with the bank.</p><p>As he tries to sort out the mess, the few staff members he hasn’t fired get on with teaching their charges how to become true thespians. One of the many pleasures of the film is that the kids in it actually look like kids, not short 24-year-old actors wearing braces; and they aren’t bratty. They all throw themselves with disarming intensity into their chosen <em>metiers</em> (one tiny boy already fancies himself a big-time agent), and seem generously unaware of the camp’s tattiness.</p><p>Theater Camp is released on 25 August in UK and Irish cinemas, and on 7 September in Australian cinemas.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/23/theater-camp-review-deeply-charming-and-hilarious-stage-kid-mockumentary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The country’s property crisis is causing damage that requires Xi to make liberal or market reforms</p><p>The long days of summer are proving to be rather too long for the government in Beijing. In an attempt to stabilise the faltering real estate market, the authorities announced earlier this week <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/21/china-cuts-interest-rate-economy-central-bank-rate">a modest decline in interest rates</a> that was underwhelming in scale and intent.</p><p>Those who recall the bad old days in which the west was buffeted by successive crises such as those involving Northern Rock, Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers will recognise the futility of lower interest rates in stemming systemic problems in real estate and finance when the problem has nothing to do with interest rates being too high.

Niven found himself inwardly repeating a question uttered countless times by him and his parents: “Oh, Gary – what have you done now?”</p><p>Gary, who was 42, was in the intensive care unit of his local hospital in Irvine, Ayrshire. He had rung the emergency services in the early hours saying he was depressed and had been trying to kill himself. An ambulance crew arrived 14 minutes later and took him to hospital where he was triaged as non-urgent and put in a room by himself. While waiting for a doctor to arrive, Gary again attempted suicide. After being found unconscious, he was put in a medical coma from which he never woke up.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/23/o-brother-by-john-niven-review-a-blistering-memoir-of-sibling-grief">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Traws Eryri, a 140-mile mountain biking route in north-west Wales, heads away from the tourist trails and highlights the region’s rugged, changeable beauty</p><p>As befits a landscape that has been regularly repurposed and reimagined over millennia of dynamic human use and interaction, Eryri (or Snowdonia) is woven like a Welsh blanket with a multitude of tracks and paths. There are Neolithic ways leading to burial mounds, Roman roads past stone forts, snaking trails through coppiced woodland to abandoned mineral workings, drovers’ roads over bleak moorland, old narrow-gauge railway tracks and slate paths haunted by the ghosts of miners walking home from slate quarry to slate cottage. Somehow, Traws Eryri (Trans Snowdonia), a new 140-mile (225km), mainly off-road bikepacking route from Machynlleth to Conwy across the great mountain fastness of north-east Wales, manages to follow them all.</p><p>The route, which launches on 23 August, was developed by Cycling UK, which is making a habit of creating excellent long-distance, multi-day cycling adventures. Traws Eryri follows <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/nov/01/cycling-king-alfreds-way-the-new-off-road-trail-around-wessex">King Alfred’s Way</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2021/sep/03/how-to-escape-the-crowds-in-cornwall-on-a-bike-west-kernow-way">West Kernow Way</a> and the Great North Trail, among others, and will be on the hot list of “must do” British exploits for two-wheeled explorers.
