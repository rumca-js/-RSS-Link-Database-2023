<p id="w5JLnC">The rumored device, which is apparently called Project Moohan internally, is supposed to offer a mixed reality experience powered by the Android platform. It has reportedly been in the works since at least last year, tracking with the <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/samsung-google-and-qualcomm-team-up-on-a-new-mixed-reality-platform/">vague announcement Google, Samsung</a>, and Qualcomm made earlier this year about creating a mixed reality platform.</p>

  <p id="korPzP">Gmail may add an extra verification step when you try to do things like adding a forwarding address and editing your filters, Google announced <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/08/stronger-protections-for-sensitive-gmail-actions.html">in a blog post on Wednesday</a>.

  <p id="i1oqjw">Tornado Cash developers Roman Semenov and Roman Storm have been charged with three conspiracy counts in an indictment unsealed today. Storm has been arrested and Semenov remains at large, according to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/tornado-cash-founders-charged-money-laundering-and-sanctions-violations">a statement from the Southern District of New York</a>.</p>
<p id="RD2AE6">Tornado Cash is a so-called “mixer,” a privacy service meant to obscure the trail of ownership for cryptocurrency that passes through it. The mixer “knowingly violated” US sanctions and “laundered more than $1 billion in criminal proceeds,” according to a statement from US Attorney Damian Williams. “While publicly claiming to offer a technically sophisticated privacy service, Storm and Semenov in fact knew that they were helping hackers and fraudsters conceal the fruits of their crimes.”</p>

  <p id="VErI0k">In its latest earnings call, Peloton reported a net loss of $242 million for the quarter. It also lost 29,000 subscribers from last quarter and had a higher-than-anticipated monthly churn of 1.4 percent. While some of that was attributed to summer doldrums, Peloton noted that costs for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/11/23720231/peloton-recall-pl-01-bike-fitness">a recent bike seat post-recall</a> “substantially exceeded” initial expectations to the tune of $40 million. An estimated 15 to 20 thousand members also chose to pause their subscriptions ahead of receiving replacement seats. </p>
<p id="s7mdAh">But speaking of recalled products, Peloton CEO Barry McCarthy said in <a href="https://investor.onepeloton.com/static-files/3f464ec7-507f-47e2-a5ae-45c35feb1711">its quarterly shareholder letter</a> that the company plans to resume US presales of the Tread Plus this holiday season for a retail price of around $6,000.

They’re officially called the Pulse Explore and will be priced at $199.99, though the company isn’t yet sharing exactly when they’ll be available (or even up for preorder). That’s as much as the Portal device itself and substantially more than any of Microsoft’s first-party Xbox audio peripherals.</p>

But the Odyssey Neo G9 name might also sound familiar because Samsung released a 49-inch model <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22587089/samsung-odyssey-neo-g9-49-inch-curved-gaming-monitor-price-specs-release-date-features">under the same name in 2021</a> that <em>only </em>offered the combined resolution of two 1440p displays.</p>
