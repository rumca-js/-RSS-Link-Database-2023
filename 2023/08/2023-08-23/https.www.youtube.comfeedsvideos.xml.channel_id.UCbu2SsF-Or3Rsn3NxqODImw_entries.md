In Armored Core VI Fires Of Rubicon, we play through chapter 1's mission "Operation Wallclimber", and achieve S Rank with minimal damage taken.

In this video we use a lightweight reverse jointed Armored Core in a duel wielding "Double Trigger" build, along with double missile pods and Boost Kicks to overwhelm every opponent along the way. We also take down the boss JUGGERNAUT without taking any damage during the boss fight. Armored Core 6 releases August 25, 2023 on PS4/5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

Mortal Kombat 1 is doing more than just restarting its timeline to reinvent itself. Instead, it preserves what's made it special over its 30-year existence while delivering its deepest combat system yet. 

Mortal Kombat has morphed and changed many times in its 30 years of existence. But through its various iterations--from 2D to 3D, with beat-em-up spin-offs and even a reboot in 2011--its identity has remained consistent with its two core tenets: scandalous and over-the-top violence, and dark, dire, and melodramatic storytelling. After playing about 90 minutes of Mortal Kombat 1, it's clear that NetherRealm Studios wants to stay true to this identity while completely reinventing itself.

The above preview takes a look at the first chapter of the Mortal Kombat 1's story mode which features Kung Lao, and the all new single player mode Invasions. Similar to MK11's Towers of Time mode, Invasions mode is a series of battles under a wide array of challenges and objectives, with each fight featuring different circumstances for the player to overcome.
