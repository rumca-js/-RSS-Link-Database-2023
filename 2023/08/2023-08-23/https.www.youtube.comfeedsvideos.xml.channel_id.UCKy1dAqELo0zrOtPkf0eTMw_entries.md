Madden NFL 24 reviewed by Wil Borger on PlayStation 5. Also available on Xbox Series X/S and PC.

Note: The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of Madden 24 do not have the same features.

"Madden NFL 24 makes several much-needed improvements to the on-field experience thanks to fantastic additions to animations and AI, but it still suffers from the same problems it always has once you get off the field: everything here is just done better in every other sports sim, even the other ones made by EA, and this year’s tweaks just aren’t enough to make up for the series’ continued feeling of sameness and lack of progress. To continue the metaphor, Madden feels like a decent but not great football team: content to coast. If it were in the right division I could see it sneaking into the playoffs, or overperforming in a good year. But it’s the kind of team that typically gets eliminated in the first round. The on-field game might be the best it’s ever been, but there are too many off-field issues here to ignore, and with each passing year it feels more and more like they’ll never be fixed. Perpetually, Madden seems like it could be a contender with time and the right changes, but right now it feels like an also-ran. And you don’t win the Super Bowl like that."

IGN's resident Pokémaniac Joshua Yehl takes you on a tour of Creatures, the Pokémon TCG headquarters. He sees the beautiful reception area and talks to the Illustration Team, playtesters, and lead game, plus he tries his hand at modeling a Magnemite from clay, and the result is... well, you'll just have to see it for yourself.

If you've ever wondered how the Pokémon TCG is made, then take a behind-the-scenes look at what goes on at Creatures, Inc. It's the place where they design and create new Pokémon trading cards, from classics such as Pikachu and Charizard, to new fan favorites that everyone loves unconditionally like Quaxly, Quaxwell, and Quaquaval.

Joshua is a competitive Pokémon TCG player, so going on this tour was a dream come true. He's overly obsessed with the best meta cards and only cares about tournament-winning decks, but could this trip to Creatures warm his heart and make him see the true beauty of Pokémon? Probably not!
