To continue the metaphor, Madden feels like a decent but not great football team: content to coast. If it were in the right division I could see it sneaking into the playoffs, or overperforming in a good year. But it\u2019s the kind of team that typically gets eliminated in the first round. The on-field game might be the best it\u2019s ever been, but there are too many off-field issues here to ignore, and with each passing year it feels more and more like they\u2019ll never be fixed. Perpetually, Madden seems like it could be a contender with time and the right changes, but right now it feels like an also-ran.
