  <p id="v2mRfT">The Google Pixel Watch 2 could get <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-watch-2-specs-3352481/">much better battery life</a> thanks to a new, more efficient processor and may even gain ultra-wideband (UWB) support, according to the typically-reliable <a href="https://twitter.com/za_raczke/status/1687810931911262208?s=46&amp;t=g01btXivdkkmtc6rgtfM-w">Kamila Wojciechowska</a>, writing for <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-watch-2-specs-3352481/"><em>Android Authority</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p id="umiAQo">The new leak says the rumored Pixel Watch successor will use the more efficient 4nm Qualcomm Snapdragon W5 Plus chip, backing up <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/30/23742793/pixel-watch-2-fitbit-sense-2-qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-plus">previous reports</a>. </p>

  <p id="aGM7oZ">Lucid Motors has announced it is reinstating “original pricing across the full air lineup,” dropping the price of two of its vehicles below $100,000, according to a press release the company shared with <em>The Verge.</em> The new base prices, “while supplies last,” will be $125,600 for the Air Grand Touring (down from $154,000), $95,000 for the Air Touring (down from $107,400), and $82,400 for the Air Pure (down from $87,400). </p>
