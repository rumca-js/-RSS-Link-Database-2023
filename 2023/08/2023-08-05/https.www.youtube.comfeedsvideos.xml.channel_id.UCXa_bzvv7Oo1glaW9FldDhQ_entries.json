The early days were good \u2013 Shadow Fall was the first PS4 game to surpass one million sales, with units sold reaching 2.4 million by March 2014. \n\nGraphically speaking, Killzone: Shadow Fall still looks incredible, and with a few neat ideas, gameplay tweaks, and a robust multiplayer system the overall experience was decent too. \n\nThing is, Killzone: Shadow Fall has been largely forgotten in the decade since release. This feature attempts to provide an explanation as to why the series trailed off following Shadow Fall\u2019s release, discusses its shortcomings, and points out the stiff competition it faces from other more well-known FPS titles.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzn-v5ti_R4", "date_published": "2023-08-05T13:30:31+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/mzn-v5ti_R4/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Atomic Heart: Annihilation Instinct DLC Review - The Final Verdict", "description": "Annihilation Instinct, the first paid DLC for Mundfish's Atomic Heart, is now available for Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, PS5 and PC. It continues the story of P-3, as it were, by venturing to the Mendeleev Complex and introducing a new \"enemy\" in NORA. Players must traverse the limited new areas to fix in-game malfunctions.\n\nYou may think there's more to the core premise, but that's more or less it, wrapped in a fetch quest with few new enemy types, two weapons and a boss. It's not terrible, but on top of highlighting some of the flaws with the game's structure - from the writing to the combat - Annihilation Instinct doesn't provide all that much bang for your buck.\n\nCheck out our review of the DLC to learn more.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C_SC8HdqFQ", "date_published": "2023-08-05T07:15:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/9C_SC8HdqFQ/hqdefault.jpg"}]
