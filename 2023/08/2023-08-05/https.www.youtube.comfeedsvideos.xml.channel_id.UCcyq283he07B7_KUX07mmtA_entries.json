It's colorless, has a much thicker stalk, and is harvested mainly throughout Central Europe for just three months of the year. During this brief period, farms in the area and restaurants around the world offer white-asparagus dishes on their menus. \n\nChef Erwin Schr\u00f6ttner from Cafe Katja in New York City says white asparagus is much juicier than the green variety, and he serves his stalks freshly peeled, boiled, and smothered in hollandaise sauce with various side dishes. But because white asparagus has to be grown in a specialized way that keeps the stalk underground for longer periods of time, these meals come at a premium. Farms like Jakobs-Hof in Beelitz, Germany, work around the clock to make sure their asparagus stalks maintain their pure white color and are of the highest quality.\n\nMORE SO EXPENSIVE VIDEOS:\nWhy Kamebishi 20-Year-Aged Soy Sauce Is So Expensive | So Expensive | Insider Business\nhttps://youtu.be/57yJA0_XU_g \nWhy Ayam Cemani Chickens Are So Expensive | So Expensive | Insider Business\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsDuXBMOdNs\nWhy Grade A Maple Syrup Is So Expensive | So Expensive Food | Insider Business\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCzx_MTtb_U\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#insiderbusiness #Germany #food \n\nBusiness Insider tells you all you need to know about business, finance, tech, retail, and more.\n\nVisit our homepage for the top stories of the day: https://www.businessinsider.com\nInsider Business on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/businessinsider\nInsider Business on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/insiderbusiness\nInsider Business on Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/businessinsider\nInsider Business on Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Business_Insider/5319643143\nInsider Business on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@businessinsider\n\nWhy White Asparagus Is So Expensive | So Expensive Food | Insider Business", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnDov0FCZk8", "date_published": "2023-08-05T16:00:30+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/OnDov0FCZk8/hqdefault.jpg"}]
