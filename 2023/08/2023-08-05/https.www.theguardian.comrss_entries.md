<p>For ages, bad posture has been assumed to cause back pain. Now some physiotherapists are rethinking what we should be doing with our spines</p><p>On the first day of classes at physiotherapy school, all students are made to strip down to their underwear. It’s not a hazing ritual, but it is an initiation of sorts. Unclothed, the students are told to study each other. Who slouches? Who has a flat back? Who suffers from forward head position?</p><p>Posture, students are taught, is the key to good health and a strong back. It will be their job, when they graduate, to correct it. People with back pain, they are told, tend to have weak muscles in their backs, leaving their spines vulnerable.

Unfortunately, it has taken more than two and a half years to call the disgraced former president to account for his actions after his loss to Joe Biden. This delay has enabled Trump and his supporters to link last week’s criminal indictment to the 2024 election campaign. They denounce it as a politically motivated bid to torpedo the Republican frontrunner’s attempted comeback.</p><p>Like so much of what Trump says, this is a blatant lie – though sadly, many Americans believe it. Biden has scrupulously distanced himself from the multiple investigations into his predecessor’s conduct. For too long, the attorney general, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/merrick-garland" title="">Merrick Garland</a>, whose justice department operates independently of the White House, failed to act – hoping, perhaps, that the Trump-Maga phenomenon would fade.

Sleep deprivation leads to ill-health but our 24/7 society is inflicting it on more and more of us<p>I barely thought about sleep in my 20s; whether I got four or eight hours didn’t seem to make much difference to how I felt the next day. A couple of decades later and it’s a different story: a night spent tossing and turning leaves me headachey and prone to travel sickness and brain fog.</p><p>These hangover-style symptoms that worsen with age are our body’s way of telling us we’re missing out on something important. Research shows that sleep is no less fundamental to physical and mental wellbeing than diet and exercise. It is driven by two biological rhythms: sleep/wake homeostasis, which is determined by when we last slept, and <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/circadian-rhythm/sleep-drive-and-your-body-clock" title="">circadian rhythm</a>, the body’s internal 24-hour clock which is triggered by light and dark, and controlled by the part of our brain that regulates hormone levels that affect body temperature, appetite and sleepiness.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/05/social-jetlag-sleep-deprivation-plaguing-society">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sarina Wiegman’s tactical switch risks playing to their last-16 rivals’ strengths but her tight-knit defence should be up to the job</p><p>As one of seven teams to have qualified for all nine Women’s World Cups, Nigeria will not regard themselves as underdogs against England on Monday.

## Thomas Morris: ‘I’ve just done a story from the view of a seagull’

<p>The short story writer and former Stinging Fly editor on the respect afforded the arts in Ireland, how his stories often take him by surprise and his love of the Welsh football team</p><p>Thomas Morris, 37, was born in south Wales and lives in Dublin. Ali Smith called his 2015 debut, <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/we-dont-know-what-were-doing-9780571317028">We Don’t Know What We’re Doing</a></em> – stories set in his home town of Caerphilly – “heart-hurtingly acute” and “laugh-out-loud funny... one of the most satisfying collections I’ve read for years”. In his new collection, <em>Open Up</em>, protagonists include a seahorse, a would-be vampire and a lonely 5ft 3in Manchester United fan whose only female friend accuses him of misogyny. Recently named one of <em>Granta</em>’s best young British novelists (“I can see myself writing novels at some point,” he tells me), Morris is a former editor of Irish literary magazine the <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/20/homesickness-by-colin-barrett-dance-move-by-wendy-erskine-reviews">Stinging Fly</a></em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/20/homesickness-by-colin-barrett-dance-move-by-wendy-erskine-reviews">, </a>where he gave debuts to Sally Rooney<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/20/homesickness-by-colin-barrett-dance-move-by-wendy-erskine-reviews">, Nicole Flattery </a>and<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/20/homesickness-by-colin-barrett-dance-move-by-wendy-erskine-reviews"> Wendy Erskine</a> among others.<br /><br /><strong>How did </strong><em><strong>Open Up</strong></em><strong> come together?</strong><br />These stories have taken time – one took four years and probably went through 82 drafts – and only two have been published; very few journals want a 12,000-word story about a man who identifies as a vampire. After my first book I needed a change, artistically and in life. Editing the<em> Stinging Fly,</em> I was reading 1,000 short stories a year. Having spent 11 years in Ireland, I moved back to my mum’s in Wales to write a second book with a little bit of prize money I’d won. In retrospect I can see the difficulties that were coming – she lived on a farm on a mountain and I can’t drive. As the money dwindled, my life got smaller and smaller and I felt very low physically and mentally. The stories aren’t autobiographical – I’m not a vampire – but they maybe dramatise that stuckness. I don’t know if it’s the moment we’re in; a lot of people in my life seem to feel anxious and confused, like: “What is any of this?” I was writing for them as much as for me.<br /><strong><br />What led you to write a story from the perspective of a seahorse?</strong><br />When I’m writing, I default to a kind of earnest realist first person that tries hard to be literary. At some point I get bored and start joking to myself: “Why not write about seahorses for a bit of relief from the Very Important Work over there?” And then the story on the left is the one that starts coming together – being caught by surprise seems to be the way for me to write. I’ve just done a story for radio from the point of view of a seagull, and one of the things I enjoy about that mode is that I can’t use my go-to small details like having someone scratch their chin or sigh during a conversation; I actually have to think, well, how does a seahorse hold its head?<br /><br /><strong>Why is football so important to your characters?</strong><br />In the past 10 years the Welsh football team has given me more pleasure than anything else in my life. I’ve long said it’s my hope to write Aaron Ramsey’s autobiography as and when he’s ready for it – we’re from the same town, he went to my school and what he and the Welsh team did has been so inspiring to me. For Big Mike [a character in one story], watching Manchester United in the 1999 Champions League final on YouTube is like putting on a nice pair of woollen socks – it’s all OK, Solskjaer will score. For me, growing up in south Wales, being a United supporter was a lovely source of comfort from afar. To have that consistent reassurance that whenever things were going to shit, I could turn on <em>Match of the Day</em> and United will win... There’s a reason so many children are glory hunters.<br /></p><p><strong>Did you always want to write?</strong><br />I started writing in earnest – apart from Welsh-language poetry as a teenager – when I moved to Dublin [in 2005] and had my own computer for the first time. I’d worked all year to save to go to college and the day before moving, I bought a laptop. Suddenly there was a space [where] I could write and my brother wasn’t going to be looking at it in the middle of the night. The first week, I found myself starting to write out fragments of memories or little experiences. I realised if I started sticking them together, there was some momentum and from there I just started fictionalising. On some level I was trying to wrap my head around the strangeness of having left Wales, but I never sat down thinking I’ll write in order to work these things out.<br /></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/05/thomas-morris-ive-just-done-story-from-the-view-of-a-seagull-open-up">Continue reading...</a>

A dilapidated property, built in 1902, makes the grade as a family home<p>Bill and Hayley Kingston bought their atmospheric house in Kent in 2017. Originally an Arts and Crafts schoolhouse built in 1902, it was in a poor state of repair. Divided into two residential properties during the 1970s, its interior bore little resemblance to any original layout. But Hayley had a clear idea of how it could look and hired architects to help realise her vision.</p><p>“It had an odd identity and didn’t seem to know what it was, but the fact that it wasn’t a standard semi-detached house appealed,” she recalls. Hayley was creative director of <a href="https://www.dencreative.com/" title="">Den Creative</a>, the digital agency she and her husband founded together before she stepped back to put more time into raising their children after the third was born. It was then that working on the design for the house became her creative outlet. Nowadays the family comprises Etienne (10), Sylvie (8) and Astrid (3), plus Dusty the dog and Mittens the cat.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/aug/05/arts-and-crafts-schoolhouse-renovation-in-kent-proves-a-class-act">Continue reading...</a>

<p>(Blue Note)<br />The Philadelphia drummer reunites his much-praised quintet for an uplifting tribute, featuring lush vibes, funky jams and irrepressible energy</p><p>Band-leading drummers have a tendency to be over-present, to get in the way of the actual music. Not so Johnathan Blake. The 47-year-old Philadelphian, who has backed everyone from Lonnie Smith to Q-Tip, remains a team player even with his own group. <em>Passage</em> reconvenes <a href="https://www.johnathanblake.com/projects-pentad">Pentad</a>, the quintet behind Blake’s much-praised 2021 Blue Note debut, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/nov/05/johnathan-blake-homeward-bound-review-blue-note">Homeward Bound</a></em>: bassist Dezron Douglas, vibes player Joel Ross, Cuban pianist David Virelles and alto sax tyro Immanuel Wilkins. A tribute to his late father, violinist <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/20/arts/music/john-blake-jr-versatile-jazz-violinist-dies-at-67.html">John Blake Jr</a>, it’s a vibrant, varied set in which all five players get to shine.</p><p>Its centrepiece is the title track, composed by John Blake Jr but never recorded, which moves from a ruminative intro to a rumbustious jam in which Wilkins evokes the bebop melodicism of Charlie Parker and later atonal developments. Although never sombre, there’s a wistful theme to much of the album – there on Muna &amp; Johna’s Playtime, a nod to Blake’s children; on <a href="https://youtu.be/eOnXDOws5AA?list=OLAK5uy_kprEmLaS28srLxM8LssjUtHA26toA8SAM">Tears I Cannot Hide</a>, a composition by the late <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/07/arts/music/ralph-peterson-jr-dead.html">Ralph Peterson Jr</a> (another drummer) and a showcase for Ross’s lush vibes; and on the funky West Berkely St, named after Blake’s childhood home. For contrast comes the Latinate Tiempos and the jaunty, itchy Groundhog Day.

<p>People scoffed at the idea of electric vehicles for the masses. But now a Tesla hatchback has outsold the Toyota Corolla</p><p>An intriguing <a href="https://uk.motor1.com/news/669260/tesla-model-y-best-selling-car-q1-2023/">news item</a> dropped into my inbox this week. It said that in the first quarter of this year, an electric vehicle (EV) had become the biggest-selling car in the world, outselling the Toyota Corolla. I know, I know, dear reader: you think this is non-news of the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claud_Cockburn">Small earthquake in Chile, not many dead</a>” variety. But to those of us condemned to follow the tech industry, three things are significant about it: the vanquished car was a Corolla, the EV was a Tesla (the Model Y hatchback), and the runner-up is made by Toyota.</p><p>The poor Corolla gets a lot of disdainful looks from petrolheads, who tell rude<a href="https://upjoke.com/toyota-corolla-jokes"> jokes</a> about it and view the vehicle as bland, unimaginative and boring. Normal people, however, have consistently <a href="https://motorandwheels.com/reasons-toyota-corolla-is-popular/">regarded it</a> as one of the best compact cars available, with good fuel economy, impressive reliability and excellent luggage capacity. And they have backed that judgment with their wallets for many years.

Films such as <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jun/26/bridesmaids-review">Bridesmaids</a></em> and <em>Road Trip</em> did more than simply put lipstick on a familiar formula – they tapped into the very specific tensions that result when the closed circle of lifelong female friendship is breached. Now the reins of the genre have been passed again, this time to a quartet of Asian Americans who work their way through cultural confusion, petty jealousies and most of a basketball team during a trip to China.</p><p>High-achieving lawyer Audrey (Ashley Park) was adopted from China by a white American couple and has a tenuous connection with her Asian roots (her favourite band is Mumford &amp; Sons). Her Chinese-American childhood best friend, Lolo (Sherry Cola), is a budding artist who weaves her cultural identity into confrontationally “sex-positive” works that nobody buys.

<p>Ben Wheatley’s prehistoric shark sequel comes adrift in a surfeit of new lizardy threats, a clunking screenplay and a total lack of onscreen chemistry</p><p>It’s hard to imagine that a film in which Jason Statham kicks a juggernaut-sized prehistoric shark in the teeth might turn out to be a colossal bore, but here we are. Despite the Stath-v-megalodon foot-to-face interaction; despite numerous shots of gigantic, battle-scarred fins hurtling at speed towards the camera; despite Ben Wheatley – a man who knows his way around pulpsploitation flicks – in the director’s seat, the sequel to the deep-sea monster attack movie <em>The Meg</em> is a dinosaur-shaped dud.</p><p>In the quest to be bigger, scarier and showier than the first film, <em>The Meg 2</em> brazenly steals from other pictures (think <em>Jurassic Shark</em>) and throws a bunch of extra creatures into the mix. Not only are there multiple megalodons; there is a pack of ocean-dwelling fish-lizard-creatures so savage that they seem to have an extra set of teeth on their chins. There’s an unheralded tentacled monster that appears out of nowhere to beef up the third-act climax.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/05/meg-2-the-trench-review-another-fin-mess-for-jason-statham">Continue reading...</a>

But now the battleground has shifted. For some, what was once just a simple process of pasting up a silly or striking poster in order to get noticed has been weaponised, as tastes change and sexual politics becomes more controversial. As a result, at this year’s festival, some of the more provocative imagery printed by performers has already been censored or even defaced.</p><p>Posters, including those displaying a lineup of bare buttocks, a large pair of breasts, a woman wearing cat paws and a drag queen children’s entertainer have all become embroiled in censorship rows and gender disputes as the festival begins this weekend.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/05/edinburgh-festival-fringe-acts-outraged-by-censorship-of-provocative-posters">Continue reading...</a>

## Labour MP Chris Bryant on cleaning up parliament, and why he’s not afraid to pick a fight

<p>The MP for Rhondda on homophobia in the church, family trauma and his own flawed record</p><p>Chris Bryant can clearly remember the moment – 3.29pm, 3 November 2021. That was when the Labour MP and chair of the standards committee feared that democracy was done for. The previous week, an investigation by the parliamentary standards commissioner, Kathryn Stone, had found that Conservative MP Owen Paterson had committed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/oct/26/owen-paterson-faces-suspension-breaking-lobbying-rules" title="">“an egregious case of paid advocacy”</a> to benefit two companies he was paid to advise, including the health firm Randox. Bryant’s committee recommended Paterson be suspended from the Commons for 30 sitting days, and now was the time for the house to vote on it. But prime minister Boris Johnson wasn’t happy with the findings or the recommendation, so the Tories did a very Johnsonian thing. They ripped up the rulebook. Former Conservative minister Andrea Leadsom proposed an amendment to pause Paterson’s suspension and set up a new Tory-led committee to examine how investigations should be carried out in future. Simple. If you don’t like justice, change the judiciary.</p><p>“It was really dangerous, what they proposed to do,” Bryant says today. “I still find it shocking that some Tories who I quite respect put their name to the amendment to scrap our committee, create a new one, no lay members on it, and with a Tory majority, chaired by a Tory MP, John Whittingdale. He rang me and said, ‘Well nobody asked me!’” The amendment was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/nov/03/tory-mp-owen-paterson-avoids-suspension-boris-johnson-sleaze-row" title="">passed by 250 votes to 232</a>. It was the first time the Commons had rejected a recommendation from its own disciplinary committee to suspend an MP for misconduct. “A lad said to me in the gym in the Rhondda the other day, when the Boris Johnson report came out from the privileges committee, saying he’d deliberately misled the house over breaches of lockdown rules, ‘If he gets away with this, there’s literally no point in voting ever again.’ And that’s what the Owen Paterson moment felt like for me.” The amendment was followed by an uproar. Paterson resigned the next day and order was briefly restored.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/aug/05/labour-chris-bryant-interview-code-conduct-book">Continue reading...</a>

And especially in summer. I enjoy gnocchi for this very reason – it’s a fast but brilliant readymade “ingredient” that is sympathetic to a lot of different flavours. In today’s case, I’ve teamed it up with a series of fresh vibrant greens, from Tenderstem to peas and from rocket to parsley, and made it richer and more exciting using a spot of cream and mustard.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/aug/05/vegan-gnocchi-with-summer-greens-recipe-meera-sodha">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The fringe can take its toll, but it’s all good material, right? Whether it’s pukey kisses, sleeping through a gig, or politician-induced paranoia, Ed Byrne, Paul Sinha, Olga Koch et al have lived to tell the tale. Plus! Ten shows to see this year</p><p>My worst fringe was in 2012 before I was even a twinkle in the eye of the comedy gods. I was at university and I wanted to be a Very Serious Actor in Very Serious Plays so spent all of my time in drama society productions. I was cast as one of the leads in a terrible piece of new writing about women’s mental health, and me and the rest of the cast lived 13 to a five-bed flat. I coped by going out and getting drunk every night, mostly ending up blacked out with my face in a bowl of plain pasta.<br /><br />One night I had my first encounter with Buckfast and got to sleep at 7am. I had to be up at 10am to flyer our show; we thought it would be a good idea to pace the Royal Mile in straitjackets to reflect the “hashtag themes” of the play.<br /><br />By the time it got to the performance I was feeling rough and, moments before I went on stage, I felt the Buckfast wield its power and I threw up. Unfortunately I had to kiss the other lead, my best friend, who’d just seen me being sick in a bucket. As we leaned in, she viscerally communicated “I hate you, you stink” with her eyes while I tried to communicate “I’m so sorry!!!” with mine. She didn’t talk to me for the rest of the run.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/05/comedians-worst-edinburgh-ed-byrne-grace-campbell-john-robins-olga-koch-paul-sinha">Continue reading...</a>

## From Here to Eternity at 70: an unusually soulful, feel-bad blockbuster

<p>Fred Zimmerman’s sturdy adaptation of James Jones’s army melodrama remains an underrated slice of homoerotic, bittersweet war-is-hell film-making</p><p>Seventy years ago, in the midst of mass critical adulation and storming box office for From Here to Eternity, the Guardian published one of the film’s few tepid reviews. “No doubt no army in a free country was at its best in pre-war years,” wrote the paper’s unnamed film critic, “but surely no unit of the American Army was quite so corrupt as this account would have us believe.” The acting and directing were “first-class”, the critic acknowledged; the film itself “[defied] credibility”.</p><p>Viewed in 2023, Fred Zinnemann’s big, muscular melodrama of Hawaiian barracks life in the months leading up to the bombing of Pearl Harbor has inevitably dated a bit – though perhaps not as much as the Guardian’s concern that it did the US army a bit dirty. Adapted from a sprawling, near-900-page bestseller by James Jones – the soldier turned author who witnessed the bombing first-hand – the somewhat streamlined film cleaned up Jones’s more damning portrait of corruption and abuse in army ranks. That was in large part so as to secure the army’s cooperation while filming on location at Schofield Barracks, and to gain access to the archival military footage of the attack that makes the film’s finale so jolting. The novel itself, meanwhile, had been censored by its publisher before going to press: in particular, multiple passages detailing homosexual activity and even sex work among soldiers were scrapped, restored only in a revised digital edition in 2011.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/05/from-here-to-eternity-at-70-an-unusually-soulful-feel-bad-blockbuster">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The effervescent goalkeeper is relishing the World Cup last-16 tie having made a huge impression at the tournament</p><p>Not many goalkeepers have played in two consecutive World Cups by the age of 22. Nor do they own the accolade, achieved at 18, of being the youngest goalkeeper in Women’s World Cup history to keep a clean sheet.

<p>The Reuters cameraman embraced the opportunity to capture life with his family in Sicily, where he grew up</p><p>With two decades’ experience as a Reuters cameraman and visual journalist, Antonio Denti says he found the transition to using his phone as a camera jarring. “I was brought up in the analogue days and was quite hostile to the idea. I’ve been in St Peter’s Square twice when the white smoke announced the election of a new pope. I covered the 2004 tsunami, conflict in Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq, Israel, Gaza. It was my job to report to those back home who could not see for themselves. Now phones can do that, and often they are held by people in the right place, at a more powerful time, long before I get there.”</p><p>Over time, however, he embraced this new opportunity to capture life, particularly with his family. He took this photo when visiting his parents, who live in Sicily. “It is a very special stretch of coast because Mount Etna, Europe’s most active volcano, hovers over it like a spirit. The coast is stark and black, made of sharp rocks in tormented shapes. In the second world war, Germans used this area as a military outpost, but for me it’s where I grew up, where I learned to both love and fear the sea.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/aug/05/antonio-dentis-best-phone-picture">Continue reading...</a>

So I made a healthy decision to buy some workout equipment online and slowly wean myself off bathtime.</p><p>Looking on Facebook Marketplace, I found a pilates reformer, a sort of bed on rails, a lie-down trampoline, with resistance straps for your arms and legs. They are usually very expensive – at least A$2,000 (£1,560) – but this one was listed for A$500. Absolute bargain!

<p>The enjoyably daft sci-fi twister starring Ben Affleck is a good jumping-off point for classic intrigues ranging from The 39 Steps and JFK to Soylent Green and The Net</p><p>Conspiracy thrillers can excel in two ways. Some strike with enough chilling plausibility to change the way you see the world, or at least the powers controlling it, while others delight with the sheer foil-hatted bonkersness of their plotting.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/hypnotic-2023">Hypnotic</a></strong>, an elaborately loopy sci-fi conspiracy twister from B-movie stalwart Robert Rodriguez, falls firmly and unapologetically into the latter category. Audiences weren’t persuaded – it tanked in cinemas – but I think it has the makings of classic midnight-marathon fodder. This is, after all, a film about a gruff cop (a remarkably straight-faced Ben Affleck) gradually uncovering, in the course of investigating his daughter’s disappearance, an elite group of hypnotists behind a spate of bank heists and more seismic world events. Things somehow get more absurd from there, in what plays like a delirious fusion of Christopher Nolan and <em>The Twilight Zone</em>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/05/hypnotic-and-the-best-conspiracy-thrillers">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Shaherazade is a rebel with an ever-evolving cause in this novelisation of the classic tales</p><p>Every creative artist knows what it is to work under a deadline, and the harshest deadline of all is presented by one’s own mortality. The quick-witted storyteller of Arabian Nights – or One Thousand and One Nights, which is preferred because several stories originated from beyond the Arab world – responded with creative ingenuity to just that predicament. It has probably inspired more translations, retellings and adaptations across cultures, generations and genres than any other text. It has influenced the works of Leo Tolstoy and Jorge Luis Borges, Marcel Proust and Salman Rushdie, Angela Carter and AS Byatt, and many more beyond the western canon.</p><p>Each new version seeks to do something different for its readership in terms of outright entertainment, literary craft, aesthetic pleasure and historical revisionism. Some succeed on some of those levels, but it is rare to find a rendition that, quite breathtakingly, comes close to doing it all. The last such work was a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/dec/15/new-arabian-nights-translation-to-strip-away-earlier-versions-racism-and-sexism" title="">translation by Yasmin Seale</a> – the only female translator of this text – who finally gave us a version without the orientalism, racism and sexism. Every Rising Sun, a novelised adaptation by Jamila Ahmed, continues what Seale began. A scholar of medieval Islamic history, Ahmed also adds historical context to her debut work.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/05/every-rising-sun-by-jamila-ahmed-review-a-feminist-take-on-one-thousand-and-one-nights">Continue reading...</a>

## Alone: the amazingly dangerous survival show where you might get eaten by a bear

<p>Becoming a human buffet is just one of the terrifying worries that contestants have in this UK version of the hit reality series. And yet, watching it feels very soothing</p><p>Alone (Sunday, 9pm, Channel 4) is reality TV with stakes so high that the contestants spend each night worrying they are about to be eaten by wild animals. If that’s not enough to get you watching then I’m not sure what is. If you had to script an episode of Alone, you’d start with someone going: “Shit, is that a bear?”, then they’d say: “I didn’t think this would be so hard”, then they’d get so hungry that they try to eat a twig, then they’d say: “Shit, I think that is a bear” and on it goes. It is repetitive, predictable, and I love it.</p><p>The format is well established in the US, where there have been 10 seasons, most of which made their way on to the recesses of various subscription services over here. It’s a survival show but without the superficial camaraderie of the ones where people are forced to join forces to knock up a raft out of cabers and dental floss. Here, 11 people who have an interest in the great outdoors or want to push themselves out of their everyday routines – though the sensible among us may argue that a pottery course would be a happy medium – agree to be dropped miles apart in an inhospitable wilderness. For its UK debut, the contestants arrive on the fringes of the Arctic Circle in Canada with no food, no water and only 10 chosen items to keep them going. In order to win £100,000, they have to simply stick it out for the longest. Viewers are getting value for money. While some contestants mess it up within hours, others endure it for a spectacularly lengthy period of time. The record on the US Alone is 100 days.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/aug/05/alone-the-amazingly-dangerous-survival-show-where-you-might-get-eaten-by-a-bear">Continue reading...</a>

## Why I keep returning to Kas, Turkey’s unspoilt seaside hideaway

In those days, Kaş was where you went for a proper night out – inevitably ending in a knuckle-whitening taxi journey back in the early hours.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/aug/05/why-i-keep-returning-to-kas-turkeys-unspoilt-seaside-hideaway">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Zuni Cafe’s iconic roast chicken salad gets the zero-waste treatment</p><p><a href="http://zunicafe.com/">Zuni Cafe</a>’s roast chicken and bread salad is one of San Francisco’s, if not California’s, most iconic dishes.<strong> </strong>And understandably so: perfectly roasted chicken on top of a bed of dressed salad and croutons soaked in chicken dripping. In my low-waste version, I make the dressing mainly from the chicken fat and without olive oil, and roast the bird on top of the bread, so it absorbs as much flavour as possible.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/aug/05/how-to-use-chicken-fat-in-us-most-famous-salads-zuni-cafe-chicken-bread-salad-zero-waste-cooking">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A dozen blurry snaps of hedges, all my payslips from 1985 and five teabags. What a fascinating life I have led thus far …</p><p>I am sitting on the porch of my father’s house in Connecticut, in stifling heat, thunder rumbling in the distance, with a pile of papers on my lap. The topmost paper is my kindergarten report card from 1968, carefully filled out in my teacher Miss Sherman’s tidy hand. “Timmy is easily upset,” she writes. “If he has trouble with a zipper he cries quietly rather than seeking help.”</p><p>I look up at my sister, who is sitting in the chair opposite. “I didn’t realise there was so much of it,” I say.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/aug/05/tim-dowling-my-sisters-have-taken-a-stand-on-my-share-of-the-stuff-in-the-attic">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Mungrisdale, Cumbria:</strong> The next generation of Lakes farmers, we hope, is learning about the benefits of hedgerows and fens</p><p>In this wet period, we are lucky to have a mostly dry evening for our farm walk at Low Beckside Farm, Mungrisdale. The walk is one of a series of events for people who want to be part of the next generation of farmers here. I have organised the event with the Farmer Network and the Lake District National Park Authority as part of my National Trust role as future farming partnership manager.</p><p>As well as working on our family farm, both my son Hector and I have full-time jobs elsewhere, meaning our farm work must be done in the early mornings, evenings and weekends. There is a long tradition of farmers with a “side hustle”; looking back in census records I can see many of my ancestors also worked in mines as well as having a farm. Hector works for the Ernest Cook Trust, a charity that owns the farm and provides educational farming opportunities for people in Cumbria.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/05/country-diary-simple-farming-measures-bring-in-the-voles-and-nesting-birds">Continue reading...</a>
