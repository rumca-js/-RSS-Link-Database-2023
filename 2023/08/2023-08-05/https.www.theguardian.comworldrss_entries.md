<p>Ukrainian drones reportedly strike ship in Kerch Strait near bridge to Crimea as national security advisers from over 40 countries meet in Jeddah</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/05/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-528-of-the-invasion">At a glance: what we know on day 528 of the invasion</a></li></ul><p>Welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This is Mark Gerts with the latest. Our top stories this morning:</p><p>A Russian tanker was hit by Ukrainian drones in the Kerch Strait, according to Russian officials. The attack briefly halted traffic on the Kerch Bridge, which links Russian-occupied Crimea to the Russian mainland.</p><p><strong>A Russian landing ship was struck and disabled in the country’s Black Sea port of Novorossiysk by an unmanned Ukrainian boat, known as a sea drone,</strong> Kyiv said. The 112-metre Olenegorsky Gornyak from Russia’s Northern Fleet, which has been used to transport troops and military hardware into occupied Ukrainian ports, was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/04/ukraine-says-it-has-put-russian-warship-out-of-action-in-sea-drone-attack">said to have been sufficiently damaged</a> to have been put out of combat action.</p><p><strong>Onboard camera footage appeared to confirm the success of the night attack on the ship.</strong> Images of a Russian warship tilting to its side emerged shortly after the strike and footage was published by the Unian news agency from the head of the marine drone appearing to show it moving stealthily across the Black Sea towards the ship and hitting it at its centre. Satellite imagery also appeared to show a Russian landing ship leaking oil while docked at a Black Sea port.</p><p><strong>US bank JP Morgan this week stopped processing payments for the Russian Agricultural Bank, Russia said on Friday.</strong> JP Morgan had handled some Russian grain export payments for the past few months with reassurances from Washington. However, that cooperation stopped this week, Russia’s foreign ministry said on Friday. “The direct channel between the Russian Agricultural Bank and JP Morgan … was closed on 2 August,” foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova was quoted by Russian media as saying.</p><p><strong>Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, visited a combat zone in Ukraine to inspect a command post and meet senior military officers, the army said on Friday.</strong> Shoigu got an update on the situation on the front and “thanked commanders and soldiers … for successful offensive operations” in Lyman in eastern Ukraine, it said, without mentioning when the visit took place.</p><p><strong>At the Russia-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, the UN nuclear watchdog said it had “finally” been granted access</strong> requested a month ago and that it had found no explosives after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/04/un-nuclear-watchdog-searches-for-explosives-at-zaporizhzhia-plant">claims of mines being planted</a> around the infrastructure.</p><p><strong>A court in Russia has extended Alexei Navalny’s prison sentence by 19 years</strong> and sentenced him to a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/04/russian-court-extends-alexei-navalny-sentence-in-penal-colony">special regime with the harshest prison conditions</a> in the country. Navalny was found guilty on six counts, including inciting and financing extremism, creating an illegal NGO, the rehabilitation of nazism and inciting children to dangerous acts. He and his supporters have rejected the charges as being politically motivated.</p><p><strong>An associate of Navalny who worked for his YouTube channel also stood trial in a Moscow court on Friday. </strong>Daniel Kholodny, a TV technician, was found guilty of organising an extremist group and sentenced to eight years in prison, Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta reported.</p><p><strong>Diplomatic tension between Poland and Belarus escalated as Warsaw claimed that two Belarusian helicopters had violated its international airspace</strong> on Tuesday. Ukraine’s SBU security service also accused Russia of preparing to stage a “false flag” attack at the Mozyr oil refinery in Belarus in order to draw Belarus into the war in Ukraine.</p><p><strong>Western and Ukrainian diplomats received a boost, however, following the announcement China would be represented in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia for a meeting of national security advisers</strong> seeking to agree on the main principles for a future peace settlement. Russia is not attending.</p><p><strong>Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie visited Ukraine on Friday and met with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy</strong> in an attempt to underscore US support for Kyiv by one of the people bidding to be the next Republican president of the US.</p><p><strong>Soprano Anna Netrebko, once among the Metropolitan Opera’s biggest box office draws, has sued the New York opera company</strong> and general manager Peter Gelb, alleging defamation, breach of contract and other violations related to the institution’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/04/russian-soprano-anna-netrebko-met-opera-russia">decision to drop her</a> following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/aug/05/russia-ukraine-war-live-russian-tanker-hit-by-drones-saudi-arabia-talks-will-be-difficult-says-kyiv-envoy">Continue reading...</a>
