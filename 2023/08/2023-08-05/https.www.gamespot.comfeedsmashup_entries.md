<p dir="ltr">With half of 2023 behind us, Wizards Of The Coast took the opportunity to announce the future of Magic: The Gathering at its Gen Con 2023 panel. However, not only did the company reveal their plans through 2026, but it also confirmed three huge names in gaming for its ever-growing Universes Beyond portfolio: Assassin's Creed, Final Fantasy, and Fallout.</p><p>Fallout will receive the MTG treatment first, and it will be represented through a set of Commander decks set to release in March 2024. Following names like Warhammer 40K and Doctor Who, the Fallout Commander decks will feature a mixture of brand-new and reprinted cards, all featuring characters, enemies, factions, and locations from Bethesda's post-apocalyptic saga.</p><figure style="width: 960px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4174880-assassinscreed-1.jpg"><img alt="Magic: The Gathering X Assassin's Creed teaser image" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4174880-assassinscreed-1.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Magic: The Gathering X Assassin's Creed teaser image</figcaption></figure><p>Assassin's Creed will come next, as a full booster set spanning the entire AC universe will launch in July 2024. The set will include both new and reprinted cards, all featuring new Assassin's Creed-themed artwork, and the new cards will be "mechanically unique" according to WOTC. Assassin's Creed will be the second non-WOTC IP to receive a full booster set, and it follows the also recently released The Lord Of The Rings: Tales Of Middle-earth.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-fallout-and-final-fantasy-are-coming-to-magic-the-gathering/1100-6516565/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Alongside the year's biggest fighting game event in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-watch-evo-2023-every-tournament-announcement-and-exhibition/1100-6516393/">Evo 2023</a>, Razer announced that its all-button Hitbox-style fighting game controller, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kitsune-All-Button-Arcade-Controller-Desktop/dp/B0CCWPPKRM">Razer Kitsune, is now available for preorder on Amazon</a>. It was first revealed back in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/razer-kitsune-fight-stick-revealed-street-fighter-editions-available/1100-6514731/">June this year</a>, and also showcased the three editions available--two of which are Street Fighter 6 collaborations. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kitsune-All-Button-Arcade-Controller-Desktop/dp/B0CCX2DMXV?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20">standard Razer Kitsune</a> goes for $300 while the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kitsune-All-Button-Arcade-Controller-Desktop/dp/B0CCWPPKRM?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20">Chun-Li edition</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kitsune-All-Button-Arcade-Controller-Desktop/dp/B0CCWSJB9Y?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20">Cammy edition</a> go for $330 each. All versions are compatible with PlayStation 5 and PC.</p><p>Razer is capitalizing on the rising popularity of leverless fighting game controllers--instead of featuring an arcade-style stick for directional inputs, these controllers map directions to four distinct buttons. This allows for quicker, more precise inputs and mitigates errant inputs that can sometimes happen on gamepads or fight sticks, although it does take some getting used to. Below, you can check out all three versions of the Razer Kitsune below with links to their preorder pages.</p><h2>Razer Kitsune - Street Fighter 6 Cammy Edition</h2><figure style="width: 1865px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1574/15747411/4174950-razerkitsunecammyedition.jpg"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/4174950-razerkitsunecammyedition.jpg" /></a></figure><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kitsune-All-Button-Arcade-Controller-Desktop/dp/B0CCWSJB9Y?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20">See at Amazon</a> </div><h2>Razer Kitsune - Street Fighter 6 Chun-Li Edition</h2><figure style="width: 1896px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/4174949-razerkitsunechunliedition.jpg"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/4174949-razerkitsunechunliedition.jpg" /></a></figure><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kitsune-All-Button-Arcade-Controller-Desktop/dp/B0CCWPPKRM?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20">See at Amazon</a> </div><h2>Razer Kitsune - Standard Edition</h2><figure style="width: 1491px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1574/15747411/4174951-razerkitsune.jpg"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/4174951-razerkitsune.jpg" /></a></figure><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kitsune-All-Button-Arcade-Controller-Desktop/dp/B0CCX2DMXV?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20">See at Amazon</a> </div><p>The Razer Kitsune features a super-thin profile, Chroma RGB lighting around the base of the chassis, and a detachable USB cable that also has a clasp to secure it in place.

<p>Choosing your main character’s class in a role-playing game is often the most important (and first) major decision you’ll make. With a universe as expansive as The Forgotten Realms, where <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/">Baldur’s Gate 3</a> takes place, there are also lots of classes to choose from. From classics like Fighter, Wizard, and Rogue, to more niche classes, such as Warlock, Bard, and Druid, there is <em>a lot</em> of flavor here, and there are many powerful abilities spread throughout the roster.</p><p dir="ltr">If you have trouble picking, or simply want to make an informed decision, I’m here to help. With 12 fully-customizable classes to choose from, as well as seven pre-made characters with unique stories of their own, I’ll go through what each class does, their power (relative to other classes), and which one you should choose for your lengthy journey through Faerun.</p><div><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a href="https://www.gamespot.com">hide</a>]</span><ul class="collapse in" id="toc_list"><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com">Baldur’s Gate 3 - Which Class To Pick</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Baldur___s_Gate_3___Which_Class_To_Pick">Baldur’s Gate 3 - Which Class To Pick</h2><p dir="ltr">The 12 selectable classes in Baldur’s Gate 3 are as follows:</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-class-tier-list-best-classes-and-which-one-you-should-pick/1100-6516555/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
