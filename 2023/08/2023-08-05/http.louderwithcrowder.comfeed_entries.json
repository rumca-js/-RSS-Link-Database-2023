Megyn Kelly talked about Bud Light, causing a leftist tabloid to attack and Keith Olbermann to scream \"PAY ATTENTION TO MEEEEEEEEEEEEE\" from his kitchen.</p><p>Megyn Kelly has a daily podcast that runs anywhere between one to two hours. On one of those shows, Kelly spent eight minutes talking with Andrew Klavan about Joe Rogan and Bud Light. It turns out Rogan, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-rogan-bud-light\" target=\"_blank\">can't decide if the Bud Light boycott</a> is silly or <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-rogan-dylan-mulvaney\" target=\"_blank\">if the company sold out their middle-class customer base</a>. Leftist tabloid The Daily Beast got its feels over it, and used it as an excuse to lash out at Kelly's credibility.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/justinbaragona/status/1687525677388484609\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Perhaps they don't understand how a daily show works. When you talk for five to ten hours a week, you cover all sorts of topics. Some days, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNc88lHcXfA\" target=\"_blank\">that means interviewing a presidential candidate</a>. Other days it means discussing a popular cultural issue. On no days is Kelly in the mood to suffer fools: \"<span style=\"background-color: initial;\">She continues to earn more than </span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">@justinbaragona</span> or <span style=\"background-color: initial;\">@keitholbermann</span> will ever gross in their lifetime, all while happily married & raising her own children.\"</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/megynkelly/status/1687614416554999808\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The reason why Olbermann was brought into it was because he was lobbing water balloons from sidelines. Filled with his own urine. That the wind blew back and caused them to splatter on his hallway walls. Now his apartment smells like both cat AND human piss.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KeithOlbermann/status/1687528320328495104\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Olbermann is fond of making fun of Megyn Kelly's appearance. Kelly, on the other hand, I don't think can ever top the last time she stole KO's soul: \"No one would marry you. And you have no children. You have a cold, lonely life in which you\u2019ve become a bitter, bitter man.\"</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gregissnacking/status/1651064749977751557\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Words</p>", "link": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/megyn-kelly-daily-beast", "date_published": "2023-08-05T13:10:22+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "http://louderwithcrowder.com/feed/", "title": "Defiant Jason Aldean surprises restaurant with acoustic performance of anti-woke anthem \"Try That in A Small Town\"", "description": "<img src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=34787366&amp;width=1200&amp;height=600&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C75\" /><br /><br /><p>Leftists have lost their touch cancelling people. <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/roseanne-barr-signs-with-elon-musk\" target=\"_blank\">Roseanne Barr is getting a new show</a>.

The artist surprised a restaurant in Tennessee with a live, acoustic performance.</p><p>Quick side note, since it deals with who the cancelers are. Once you are done here, check out David Brooks' piece \"What if we're the bad guys here?\"  It's the elitist equivalence of this:</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"e1786\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=34787379&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>Aldean appeared for the grand opening of his new \u201cJason Aldean\u2019s Kitchen and Rooftop Bar\u201d in the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee.

Turns out that the more the Left hates something, the more Americans love it. Either that or Americans just want to enjoy good music.
