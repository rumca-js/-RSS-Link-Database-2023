It´s about damn time!

Day 5 has been great, lots of progress and we are getting closer to the real timing tests for the proto.

The prototype is designed to answer the age old question: Can I play tight music using a very strong flywheel? The new flywheel have 20x more moment of inertia compared to the MMX Flywheel.

We are recording at the wonderful location of Siegfrieds Mechanical Music Museum in Rudesheim Am Rhein, Germany. The museum will livestream the upcoming Wintergatan meetup 4-6 august on their youtube channel, check it out here: https://www.youtube.com/@Musikkabinett
