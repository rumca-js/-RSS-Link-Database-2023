  <p id="s03QOP"><em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</em> will be released on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, EA CEO Andrew Wilson announced during the company’s Q1 earnings call on Tuesday. The game launched in April on PS5, Xbox Series X / S, and PC but skipped Sony and Microsoft’s older hardware, so with this new release, people who haven’t upgraded to the newer consoles will eventually be able to check out the game.</p>
<p id="yr0mhG">However, we don’t know exactly when <em>Jedi: Survivor</em> will be coming to older consoles. Here’s Wilson’s quote about the release: “Thanks to the strength of this legendary franchise and community demand, our development team has committed to bringing this Jedi experience to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.”</p>

<p id="IAwonQ">The company’s new CEO, <strong>Robert Kyncl</strong>, was most recently the chief business officer of YouTube, where he helped transform the platform into one of the biggest names in creator monetization and streaming music. Before that, he was vice president of content at Netflix, working on partnerships as it entered the streaming era.</p>

  <p id="qquVHJ">The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is probing reports that 2023 Tesla Model 3 and Model Y vehicles lose their steering control while driving. Approximately 280,000 vehicles could be affected by the results of the investigation, the agency reports.

<p id="sTehuY">NHTSA says it has received 12 complaints alleging loss of steering control and power steering in the vehicles. Five people filed complaints alleging an inability to steer the vehicle, while an additional seven people said a loss of power resulted in steering difficulties. </p>

Offshore wind resources are plentiful enough to generate up to a quarter of the nation’s electricity by 2050, in time to help meet global climate goals. </p>
<p id="q4N4lB">It will take a monumental effort to reach those goals, with very little offshore wind capacity installed in the US today. And the industry is currently facing mounting political and financial challenges even after the Biden administration moved to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22725234/biden-offshore-wind-boost-united-states-coastlines">open up</a> much of the country’s shoreline to offshore wind development. </p>

  <p id="a9b3O7">If you’re in the market for a premium console from either Sony or Microsoft, now is the perfect time to pick one up. For the first time we’ve seen, both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X are on sale — each currently selling for $449.99 ($50 off). The disc drive-equipped PS5 is discounted at <a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monoprice.com%2Fproduct%3Fp_id%3D44917" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Monoprice</a>, while you can get Microsoft’s flagship Xbox on sale from <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/microsoft-xbox-series-x-game-console-8k-hdr-1-tb-ssd/apd/ab365503" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dell</a>.</p>
<p id="HMDolE">It’s refreshing to see both consoles running on deals that don’t require bundling with a game or added accessories. After they were so hard to get for around two years thanks to shortages, they’re now easily buyable and 50 bucks off — no fuss, no muss.</p>

The changes are available globally on mobile web and desktop.</p>
<p id="cqMguc">The updates could make Reddit better for those who stumble upon it through a search engine, whizlogic said. “These people are often looking for community-verified content on their mobile, tablet or desktop devices. While some people in this group know Reddit and are seeking it out specifically, many others visit Reddit infrequently or are just finding it for the first time.”</p>

He wasn’t right when he tried to rename PayPal in 2000 and create an internet upstart in banking; he’s not right now, either. But that isn’t going to stop him from trying to Show Us.</p>
<p id="n8lGTf">Musk says he wants to rename Twitter X, and the Twitter logo has already changed on the app to a Unicode X. There’s some history here with Musk and X: when Peter Thiel defenestrated him from PayPal, it was because Musk wanted to rename PayPal.

In <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/08/pixar-adobe-apple-autodesk-and-nvidia-form-alliance-for-openusd/">a press release</a>, the companies announced the formation of the <a href="https://aousd.org/">Alliance for OpenUSD</a>, which will drive the “standardization, development, evolution, and growth” of <a href="https://www.pixar.com/usd">Pixar’s Universal Scene Description (USD) technology</a>.</p>
<p id="phhkXn">Pixar describes USD as the “first open-source software that can robustly and scalably interchange 3D scenes” while incorporating various assets, sources, and animations.

  <p id="Vvv6mF">Meta’s Oversight Board is urging the company to take a stricter stance against content that normalizes gender-based violence after discovering a Facebook post mocking an injured woman had remained on the platform for almost two years without being viewed by a human moderator. <a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/813577783586004-oversight-board-overturns-meta-s-original-decision-in-image-of-gender-based-violence-case/">On Tuesday</a>, the board asked Meta to address a gap within its bullying and harassment policy that seemingly permits content promoting gender-based violence by “praising, justifying, celebrating, or mocking it” to slip through its moderation practices.</p>
<p id="KnOJ44">An image depicting a woman with “visible marks of a physical attack, including bruises on her face and body” was published on Facebook in May 2021, alongside a caption in Arabic that alludes to her husband being...</p>

  <p id="SjuOVg">Anker didn’t exactly knock it out of the park with its first 3D printer, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23612429/ankermake-m5-review-3d-printer">the AnkerMake M5</a>, but today, it’s trying again.

  <p id="kv3NhL">Fitbit’s been going through a lot of changes over the past year — and it looks like that’s only going to continue. The Google-owned app is getting a total redesign this fall, and select Fitbit users may see an invite to try a beta version starting today.</p>
<p id="8KtASr">For starters, Fitbit is reorganizing how it presents your data. Going forward, the app will be divided into three tabs: Today, Coach, and You. The Today tab isn’t changing too drastically from what it is now, but the main metrics you see up top can be customized to highlight different focus areas. For example, if you want to sleep better, you’ll see your Sleep, steps, mindfulness, and Zone Minutes first thing. If your goal is to improve your heart health, the app will instead emphasize...</p>

  <p id="dKdwsm">The world of portable speakers is vast and varied — a fact that is immediately apparent if you punch the words “Bluetooth speaker” into Google or Amazon. Thankfully, if you’ve been scouring the web for something affordable that will still sound better than your phone, <strong>Sony’s SRS-XB100 speaker </strong>is on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C29CL98P/ref=ewc_pr_img_1?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;psc=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/ckhcSYRvFAa">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://electronics.sony.com/audio/speakers/wireless-speakers/p/srsxb100-l/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">direct from Sony</a> for as little as $48 ($12 off), its lowest price to date.</p>

The rugged little speaker offers up to 16 hours of continuous battery life and IP67 dust and water resistance, too, making it as suitable for an outing in the park as a pool party in your own backyard.
