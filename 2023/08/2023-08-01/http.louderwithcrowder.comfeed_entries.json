Yet this one includes strippers, bananas, and eating bananas that came out of strippers. You can guess from where.</p><p>Lizzo believes in body positivity for me and not for thee, according to a new lawsuit filed by three former dancers. They also allege sexual harassment and a hostile work environment.</p><p>The fat-shaming came in the form of a \"concern\" that the dance wasn't committed anymore. Turns out the word \"lazy\" is a dog whistle.</p><p><a href=\"https://variety.com/2023/music/news/former-lizzo-dancers-sexual-harassment-weight-shaming-lawsuit-1235684625/\" target=\"_blank\">According to the lawsuit</a>: \u201cIn professional dance, a dancer\u2019s weight gain is often seen as that dancer getting lazy or worse off as a performer. Lizzo\u2019s and Ms. Scott\u2019s questions about Ms. Davis\u2019s commitment to the tour were thinly veiled concerns about Ms. Davis\u2019s weight gain, which Lizzo had previously called attention to after noticing it at the South by Southwest music festival.\"</p><p>For reference, this is Lizzo:</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"d6eea\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=34743966&amp;width=980\" />\n</p>\n<p>Then there is the degeneracy. <a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2023/08/01/lizzo-sued-by-dancers-for-allegedly-forcing-them-to-watch-sex-shows/\" target=\"_blank\">The lawsuit highlights</a> a trip to Amsterdam where \u201c\u2026 things quickly got out of hand. Lizzo began inviting cast members to take turns touching the nude performers, catching dildos launched from the performers\u2019 vaginas, and eating bananas protruding from the performers\u2019 vaginas.\u201d</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"e43f5\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=34745023&amp;width=980\" />\n</p>\n<p>More like \"this one time at band camp....\" Amirite?</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"c1e4f\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=34745125&amp;width=980\" />\n</p>\n<p>What is most humorous about this lawsuit is that exactly two months ago, the plus-sized diva threatened to <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2023-06-01/lizzo-quit-music-locks-twitter-account-body-shaming-comments\" target=\"_blank\">quit the music business if people didn't stop fat shaming her</a>. Fans and trolls aren't allowed to call her lazy or worse off as a performer. Only she can do that!</p><p>Lizzo didn't respond to anyone who asked for comment. The fat-shaming thing is fun because... I mean, look at her. But I can see how that would be hard to prove in court. The banana out of the vagina thing has at a club with eyewitnesses. Whether any of them were too high to remember anything is what discovery is for.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

McConaughey seems like a decent dude. But when <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dont-believe-matthew-mcconaughey\" target=\"_blank\">it comes to gun rights</a>, he's both wrong and easily confused. </p><p>McConaughey was a guest on ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week\u201d to discuss the \"Green Lights Grant Initiative\" he started to help schools get grants to increase safety and security. It's in response to the tragic Uvalde killings where children were slaughtered in school <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/uvalde-shooting-ten-minutes\" target=\"_blank\">because authorities wouldn't use their guns to take down the killer for over an hour</a>. They even <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/uvalde-shooter-funeral-director\" target=\"_blank\">stopped someone who wanted to use his gun the save the day</a>.</p><p>The actor points to the \"Bipartisan Safer Communities Act\" which was supposed to provide funds for schools to increase security and mental health services. Twelve schools applied. ZERO has been approved for funding from the government. McConaughey saying \"what the f*ck\" is why he was invited on the show. But of course, <a href=\"https://www.dailywire.com/news/matthew-mcconaughey-wants-to-change-the-term-gun-control-to-pass-more-gun-control\" target=\"_blank\">talk turned to gun control</a>.</p><p>Stop me if you've heard this one before:</p><blockquote>\"I changed the word from \u2018control\u2019 to \u2018responsibility.' Control sounds like a mandate and nobody wants a mandate. No one wants to be controlled. But responsibility is still something that we can all go, yeah, \u2018I\u2019ll take responsibility\u2019, and a lot of the far-right or the Republicans, they almost feel like responsibility is a value that they have ownership of and it\u2019s a sense of almost pride and honor to be responsible.\"</blockquote><p>M'kay. Two things. One, I don't know who these far-right or Republicans that McCounghey thinks he's responsibility-splain too. If there is one thing most of us have managed to stay unified in our defense of the Second Amendment.</p><p>Two, does my dude really think he invented calling something by a different name to hide the Left's true agenda? That's ALL they do. They don't keep it a secret. Not unlike his \"genital mutilation\" is now \"gender-affirming care.\"</p><p>McConaughey didn't even invent doing it for gun control. Leftists have been attempting to make \"common sense gun reform\" a thing for years. I know it's gun control. You know it's gun control. They think they're fooling someone.</p><p>The saddest thing is this isn't the dumbest gun-related thing McConaughey has said. In 2018 <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/matthew-mcconaughey-supports-gun-control-at-austin-marchforourlives\" target=\"_blank\">while speaking at a March for Our Lives rally</a>, he claimed it wasn't about taking people's guns away. A month later he realized that<a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/matthew-mcconaughey-supports-gun-control-at-austin-marchforourlives\" target=\"_blank\"> the movement WAS about taking guns away</a>. But instead of admitting he should have done more research, claimed the movement was being \"hijacked.\" </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

An odd choice since in Dylan's portrayal of a woman he presented as someone too ditzy and basic to know what March Madness was, as opposed to any of the thousands of women who love college basketball.</p><p>2. A podcast appearance of now-former Bud Light VP Alissa Heinersceid came to light. <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-vice-president-marketing\" target=\"_self\">The now disgraced marketing elitist lashed out at Bud Light customers as \"fratty\" and \"out of touch</a>.

There is a trend with progressives where the only way to be \"inclusive\" and \"for everyone\" is to sh*t on the people who currently enjoy a product. It's called the <a href=\"https://boundingintocomics.com/search/kathleen%2bkennedy\" target=\"_blank\">Kathleen Kennedy</a> method.</p><p>3. No one at any level of AB, ABInBev, or Bud Light thoughts to utter four simple words: \"Sorry, we f*cked up.\"</p><p>\n\tAfter Bud Light's role as the #1 beer in America was sabotaged by people who don't drink Bud Light and hate people who do drink Bud Light because they want their customers to be someone else entirely, the company is in a position where they \"need to focus on a new crop of drinkers.\" People who enjoy the taste of a glass of water if you swished around dirty pennies in it have Coors Light and Miller Lite to choose from. Others are hopefully turning local and checking out any of the local breweries in their neighborhood.</p><p>I say Bud Light owns it and goes hard in the other direction. Make Dylan Mulvaney the official Queen of Beers. Bring in former VP Melissa Weinerchild to say \"You're goddamned right I think you rubes are fratty and out of touch.\" And target to a niche audience of upper-class elitists and gender identity-obsessed progressive zoomers who demand their political worldview be validated by everything and everyone.<br />\n</p><p>The company will never admit it made a mistake.

I'm sure <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chris-pratt-cancelled-twitter\" target=\"_blank\">the usual suspects will be on the attack</a> over him speaking at the event by lunchtime.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/prattprattpratt/status/1686175360663375872\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n<blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dwyermacklin/status/1686027359009316865\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Pratt gave a powerful testimony of his Faith and what accepting Jesus into his life has meant.</p><p>\"It has truly made the difference in my life. It has grounded me in a way that I honestly could never have been grounded. I live in this crazy world with all you folk and I see the weirdest stuff in Hollywood. And I'm really grateful I have that anchor. Jesus has been after me my whole life.\"</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lexapower/status/1685853531536769024\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I look forward to seeing how much content is created bashing Pratt for praising Jesus without also affirming the Sisters who bash Jesus and call it family-friendly entertainment.</p><h3>I turned off the internet for June. What happened with the sisters of the what now?</h3><br /><p>You may remember the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence from such blog posts last this 2019 classic, \"<a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/another-child-sex-offender-discovered-at-drag-queen-story-time\" target=\"_self\" title=\"view post: ANOTHER Child Sex Offender Discovered at 'Drag Queen Story Time'\">ANOTHER Child Sex Offender Discovered at 'Drag Queen Story Time'</a>.\" The \"Sisters\" <a href=\"https://www.outkick.com/los-angeles-dodgers-lgbtq-pride-night-sisters-perpetual-indulgence-apology-invite/\" target=\"_blank\">frequently dress as Jesus, Mary and other religious figures</a>, and brag about mocking the Stations of the Cross, and even the Eucharist. The Dodgers had uninvited them from Pride Night when it was brought to the team's attention that this is considered offensive to millions of people.</p><p>NOTE: <strong>No one complained about the Dodgers having a Pride night.</strong> It was just this one group of blasphemous queens.</p><p>After the \"Sisters\" were uninvited, leftist politicians got involved and the team was forced to bend the knee and invited them back with a full-throated apology. LGBTQ activist bullies demand you support their every kink, or else.</p><p>Eventually, Pride Night happened and there <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dodgers-pride-night-protest\" target=\"_blank\">were more people protesting the Sisters outside</a> than there were to see them get their award inside. The Sisters were snuck in and honored over an hour before the first pitch was thrown.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.
