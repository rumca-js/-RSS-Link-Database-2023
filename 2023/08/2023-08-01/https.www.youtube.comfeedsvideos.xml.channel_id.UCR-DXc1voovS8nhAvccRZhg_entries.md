LTX 2023 blew away my expectations. Definitely a great comeback after the pandemic break. Despite sometimes long lines, the enthusiasm and kindness shown by all those I met were amazing.

I didn't expect to meet so many people and have so many great conversations on the floor. I had to duck out a couple times just because the sheer energy was so high, lol.
