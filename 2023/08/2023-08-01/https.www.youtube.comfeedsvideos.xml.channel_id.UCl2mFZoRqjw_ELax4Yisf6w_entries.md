00:00 - Intro
03:58 - Why people are mad at marcan?
05:26 - Why do we distrust or assume the worst of Apple?
05:33 - Apple lobbyists speaking disingenuously to legislators
06:50 - Error 53
07:40 - Error 53 had nothing to do with security
08:15 - If Apple doesn't know how their devices work - how should we?
08:50 - Why Error 53 NEVER passed the smell test as a "security feature"
10:50 - Distinction between Apple's error vs. independent's error
11:35 - No anti-intellectualism
11:55 - Even if the repairman was wrong about the why, he's right about the outcome
12:18 - Where we're coming from
12:55 - Let's discuss the engineering decisions
14:10 - This ends the same way regardless of who at Apple did it
14:50 - Apple's history of unnecessary decisions cutting against repair
15:05 - Apple's hiding of error codes/diagnostics
16:20 - WE HAVE NO INFORMATION ON HOW THESE DEVICES WORK!
17:18 - Apple's own techs think the charge port is attached to the motherboard
17:50 - What we're asking for - open lines of communication
18:14 - The first time isn't malice - the 10000th time is
18:55 - Apple's repair systems are bad, that's not malicious
19:25 - When it happens 10k+ times and you ignore it, it's malicious
20:03 - I understand & respect Marcan's point
20:20 - I'm not throwing the repair person under the bus, because Apple created this situation to begin with
21:02 - We could put all of this aside and start from scratch.
22:51 - Conclusion: how I WISH I could reply to journalists
25:53 - A sad attempt to shill merch

## Apple has been referring customers to scammers for YEARS; let's end that today
