We&#8217;ve long believed in the power of online platform interoperability and the power it gives to users to curate their own experiences. One of the prime examples of this is Block Party, created by Tracy Chou, which has had to suspend its operations following ExTwitter&#8217;s API changes. Tracy joined us on the podcast once before [&#8230;]

There’s so much to dig into on this one. First off, just to state my own bias upfront, I’m not a fan of the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH). Literally just a few days ago I wrote about one of its highly questionable studies and how it’s being used (badly) to justify a terrible [&#8230;]

Censorship has always been the name of the game when governments push &#8220;fake news&#8221; laws.

But, in reality, governments just want more options [&#8230;]

Speech has consequences. Elon Musk has decided to reenable accounts suspended for posting CSAM while at the same time allowing the most basic of CSAM scanning systems to break.

For 25 years secrecy surrounding the encryption algorithms used in TETRA kept researchers [&#8230;]

As some of you might have seen, this past weekend, the NY Times ran a very nice profile about me, written by Kashmir Hill. There’s not much to say about it, other than it was an interesting (if somewhat awkward-feeling) experience to be the subject of a story, rather than the journalist covering it. But [&#8230;]
