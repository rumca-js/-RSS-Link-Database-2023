All you have to do is grate your oblong piece of produce, cook it down with butter, and toss it with some spaghetti, along with starchy pasta water. It turns out you can do the same song and dance with ripe peaches, and the results are delightful.</p><p><a href="https://lifehacker.com/turn-a-peach-into-a-sweet-and-summery-pasta-sauce-1850693637">Read more...</a></p>
