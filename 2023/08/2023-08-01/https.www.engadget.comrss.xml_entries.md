<p>If your idea of relaxation involves opening cardboard boxes, you're in for a good time. Humble Games and Witch Beam have <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayHumbleGames/status/1686440615356092434">confirmed</a> that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/unpacking-heads-to-phones-and-tablets-later-this-year-192946616.html"><em>Unpacking</em></a> is coming to iOS and Android on August 24th. You can <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcHMuYXBwbGUuY29tL3VzL2FwcC91bnBhY2tpbmcvaWQ2NDUwMDU4MTM1IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4ZjY2YTIwOS03ZjllLTQyZmEtOTYyYS03NjhhMWQ1ZDBmMzYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZgVKbp_8xmMlxkhNdWlfaEozxJSt_XhA57bsRfHT1H1&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Funpacking%2Fid6450058135">pre-order</a> the iOS version for $10 today. This has been a long time in coming given that the game first arrived on consoles and PCs in 2021, but it may be worthwhile if you're new to the concept.</p><p><em>Unpacking</em> is, at its heart, a hybrid puzzle and home decoration game. You have to find space for items as an unseen person moves into a new abode. There's no time limit or other pressure, and it can be very soothing as you set up a child's bedroom or the family kitchen. However, it's particularly clever for the way it tells its story. You're learning about a woman's life by seeing where she goes and what she brings with her, rather than dialog. As the title is almost entirely wordless, it's accessible to a wide range of people.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="c2d36e6820c34dabb916361e923a6b1c"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>The game isn't changing significantly with the move to mobile. However, the developers argue <em>Unpacking</em> is "perfect" for touch as you can drag objects with your finger and sense the world through haptic feedback. Whether or not that's true, the portability may be appealing. This may be the most appropriate game to play when you've just moved to a new place — you can fire it up while your usual gaming hardware is still packed away.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/zen-moving-game-unpacking-comes-to-android-and-ios-on-august-24th-214513079.html?src=rss

Sega’s classic maraca-shaking rhythm franchise is seeing a renaissance this year as the new installment arrives on Apple platforms and Nintendo Switch on the same day. A VR port for Meta Quest, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vr-assassins-creed-stranger-things-and-ghostbusters-arrive-on-meta-quest-later-this-year-174119442.html">announced</a> in early June, is also scheduled to launch sometime this fall.</p><p>“Shake it with your maracas and groove to 40 hit songs from the world’s most popular genres,” the game’s App Store description reads. Exclusive songs for the Apple version include “The Edge of Glory” by Lady Gaga, “Daddy” by Psy (of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-12-21-gangnam-style-one-billion-views.html">“Gangnam Style”</a> fame) and “The Walker” by Fitz and the Tantrums. The Apple Arcade version’s title, <em>Samba de Amigo: Party-To-Go</em>, emphasizes its portable nature. The Switch version is called <em>Samba de Amigo: Party Central</em>, while the Meta Quest version is simply <em>Samba de Amigo</em>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Neither Sega nor Apple has said much about how gameplay details may differ between Apple’s variant and the other platforms, except that the Apple Arcade version will exclusively have the series’ first story mode. “Embark on a quest with Amigo to return lost music to the world,” the blurb reads.</p><figure><img alt="Marketing still for Sega’s Apple Arcade game ‘Samba de Amigo: Party-To-Go.’ Samba (with a purple face and retro-futuristic sunglasses) jams out with glow sticks as a spiral of rhythm guidance appears as an HUD overlay.

## MrBeast sues his fast food chain for selling 'inedible' burgers

<p>YouTube star <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtubes-top-trending-videos-technoblade-will-smith-slap-dream-mrbeast-mark-rober-encanto-080158954.html">MrBeast</a> (aka Jimmy Donaldson) may be as well known for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fall-guys-specialeffect-competition-ninja-190309081.html">his collaborations</a> as he is his videos, but one of those partnerships is souring quickly. <em>Bloomberg</em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-31/mrbeast-sues-his-food-delivery-partner-over-inedible-burgers?sref=10lNAhZ9">reports</a> the creator is suing Virtual Dining Concepts, the &quot;ghost kitchen&quot; (a food service that operates from other restaurants) that runs his delivery-only MrBeast Burger fast food chain, for allegedly tarnishing his brand. VDC was supposedly more interested in rapid expansion than maintaining quality, leading to subpar food that reflected badly on its namesake. He wants a judge to terminate the licensing agreement and shut down the business.</p><p>MrBeast points to numerous reviews that call the burgers &quot;inedible,&quot; &quot;revolting&quot; and similarly less-than-flattering descriptions. &quot;Thousands&quot; of customers have reportedly complained about raw meat, cold fries, missing ingredients and items that never showed. Some locations couldn't get the branding right, delivering orders in generic containers or even 7-11 bags.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The YouTuber's lawyers claim VDC either refused or was incapable of fixing quality issues when he got in touch. He adds that he hasn't received &quot;a dime&quot; from MrBeast Burger despite being owed royalties, and that the virtual chain frequently uses branding and registers trademarks without consent. VDC has allegedly been reluctant to support fledgling brick-and-mortar restaurants as they'd cut into its profits. It's using the MrBeast name to attract other celebrities, according to the lawsuit.</p><p>We've asked VDC for comment. MrBeast formed the partnership in 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced many people to switch to delivery food. It was a way to help (and capitalize on) fans while giving restaurants more business at a time when in-person dining wasn't an option. MrBeast Burger would share its revenues with hosts, rather than competing directly with those brands.</p><p>Ghost kitchens will carry on regardless of the lawsuit's outcome. They let entrepreneurs launch restaurants with only a small physical footprint, and lean on services like DoorDash and Uber Eats for delivery. However, the legal action illustrates what can go wrong with these outlets — without a retail presence, they aren't always subject to the same scrutiny as their conventional counterparts.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mrbeast-sues-his-fast-food-chain-for-selling-inedible-burgers-203055288.html?src=rss

## Meta is reportedly planning an Abe Lincoln chatbot as part of a public AI push

<p>Meta is preparing to launch AI-enabled chatbots with unique personalities, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fa76c8ce-cdfd-458c-baec-73dceb2d2ad5"><ins>according to a report by </ins><em><ins>Financial Times.</ins></em></a> What’s more? It looks like the first chatbot released will be none other than Abraham Lincoln, so you’ll be able to ask good ole Honest Abe his thoughts on Barbenheimer or whatever. The company is also reportedly creating a surfer personality expressly for making travel plans.</p><p>This is an attempt to boost engagement across Meta’s social media platforms, as human-like discussions tend to be more interesting than droll robotic responses. The company hasn’t announced which of these platforms would host Abe Lincoln and his pals, though <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-is-working-on-ai-personas-for-instagram-messenger-and-whatsapp-223316961.html"><ins>previous reports indicated</ins></a> Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp would be recipients of this new technology. Meta staffers are calling these chatbots “personas” and they could launch as soon as September.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>These personas will provide a new way to search and they’ll even offer recommendations, similar to how current chatbots work, though ChatGPT and the rest don’t have Abraham Lincoln on the payroll (just don’t ask him about the best local opera houses.)</p><p><em>FT</em> notes that the chatbots could also collect vast amounts of personal data, something <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-ftc-wants-to-ban-meta-from-profiting-from-kids-data-180720686.html"><ins>Meta has never shied away from.</ins></a> After all, you’ll likely share more personal details with a human-like companion than one devoid of personality.

## The award-winning Feminist Frequency is shutting down after 14 years
 - [https://www.engadget.com/the-award-winning-feminist-frequency-is-shutting-down-after-14-years-185321464.html?src=rss](https://www.engadget.com/the-award-winning-feminist-frequency-is-shutting-down-after-14-years-185321464.html?src=rss)

<p>Feminist Frequency announced today that it’s shutting down. The nonprofit, founded in 2009 by Executive Director Anita Sarkeesian as an outlet for media criticism of video games and other pop culture, expanded through the years to include podcasts, gaming resources, and an Online Harassment Hotline. Although the organization’s industry resources will remain on <a href="https://feministfrequency.com/">its website</a> indefinitely, the hotline will close at the end of September, and the remainder of Feminist Frequency will wind down by the end of 2023.</p><p>“I started this project to fill a need that was missing in the media criticism and video games space,” Sarkeesian wrote in a press release today. “Over the past decade and a half, along with an invaluable team of staff members and industry partners, we’ve accomplished so much to be proud of. Feminist Frequency grew into something I never could have anticipated when it began all those years ago. At this point, I think it’s important to share that exhaustion and burnout — not uncommon in the nonprofit world — have taken their toll.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The organization added that Jae Lin, director of the confidential emotional support hotline, will continue to run <a href="https://gameshotline.org/respec/">ReSpec</a>, the hotline’s accountability support space. In addition, a private event at next year’s Game Developers Conference will honor Feminist Frequency’s accomplishments through the years.</p><p>Sarkeesian founded Feminist Frequency while studying for her master’s degree at York University in Toronto. In 2010, she began producing <em>Tropes vs. Women</em>, a series of videos examining misogynistic storytelling trends in movies and television. But a 2012 Kickstarter campaign to fund a video series <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn4ob_5_ttEaA_vc8F3fjzE62esf9yP61">highlighting the same problems in the gaming industry</a> raised the organization’s profile dramatically — for better and worse.</p><figure><img alt="Activist and Feminist Frequency founder Anita Sarkeesian in a video thumbnail for the series &#x002018;Tropes vs. Women in Video Games.&#x002019; She faces the camera on the right as images of Zelda and Princess Peach dressed as Link and Mario sit on the left." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/aa9e7e20-3098-11ee-9ef3-194ec17a20d4" style="height: 720px; width: 1280px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Feminist Frequency</div></figure><p>The campaign <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/566429325/tropes-vs-women-in-video-games/description">shattered</a> Sarkeesian’s $6,000 fundraising goal in less than a day. And while the video series boldly confronted the growing industry’s casual objectification and minimization of female characters (and real-world abuse towards female gamers), it also triggered a backlash from the darkest segments of society that her work singled out — helping to spawn the harassment campaign known as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-01-15-nightline-investigates-gamergate-online-harassment.html">Gamergate</a>. Sarkeesian quickly became a favorite target of abuse — online and off. In 2014, someone <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-09-17-anita-sarkeesian-gdc14-bomb-threat.html">sent a bomb threat</a> because she was a scheduled speaker at the Game Developer’s Choice award ceremony. The same year, she was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-10-15-anita-sarkeesian-speech-canceled-following-threats-safety-conce.html">forced to cancel a speech</a> at Utah State University based on loose security after a student sent an email threatening “the deadliest school shooting in American history” if the event continued. The FBI even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-27-fbi-releases-redacted-report-of-its-gamergate-investigation.html">got involved</a>.</p><p>“Harassment is the background radiation of my life,” Sarkeesian <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141126142636/http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-11-26/anita-sarkeesian-battles-sexism-in-games-gamergate-harassment">told</a><em>Bloomberg</em> in 2014. “It is a factor in every decision I make. Any time I tweet something, or make a post, I’m always thinking about it. When I post our videos, it’s a consideration. It affects where I go, and how I behave, and how I feel walking down the street every day.”</p><p>Despite the abusive ambiance, Sarkeesian continued the organization’s work to highlight injustices and provide resources. Intel <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-01-08-the-most-important-news-at-ces-is-a-300-million-response-to-gam.html">partnered with Feminist Frequency</a> in 2015 as part of a $300 million campaign to help promote career opportunities and positive representation for women and minorities. Feminist Frequency <a href="https://peabodyawards.com/feministfrequency/">received a Peabody Award</a> for Digital and Interactive Storytelling last year. And, although far too slowly, the industry has made gradual progress. “The work we’ve done to effect change in the industry made a difference, and all of us at Feminist Frequency and the Games and Online Harassment Hotline are hopeful to see improvements continue to be made,” she wrote today. “But the time has come to close this chapter and rest before starting the next phase of my professional life.”</p><p>Reflecting on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-04-27-tropes-vs-women-in-video-games-says-goodbye.html">the end of the <em>Tropes vs. Women in Video Games</em> series</a> in 2017, Sarkeesian said, “It hasn’t all been for the better, but some of it definitely has. There are conversations happening now, among players and among creators, that weren’t happening before.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-award-winning-feminist-frequency-is-shutting-down-after-14-years-185321464.html?src=rss

<p>Modern gaming controllers are expensive, costing anywhere from $60 to $180, depending on the feature set. So it’s a huge bummer when one breaks and you have to shell out money for a replacement. Microsoft is taking a huge leap into the world of self-repair by <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=67071605-d4df-494e-8d9c-c9c236b8bb38&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Microsoft&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NzA3MTYwNS1kNGRmLTQ5NGUtOGQ5Yy1jOWMyMzZiOGJiMzgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWljcm9zb2Z0LmNvbS9lbi11cy9zdG9yZS9iL3hib3gtcmVwYWlyLXBhcnRzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5NjE0Y2Y0MS01ZjlhLTRmZDQtODQyNi0xMWI2MjM2NzhlMmEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAd7-oJp6euNFloCLL9wjUnTiN9V8ZdsZ84MAk3Y65OnJ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fb%2Fxbox-repair-parts"><ins>offering replacement parts for Xbox gamepads,</ins></a> along with downloadable instructions and step-by-step tutorial videos, which should save gamers some cash in the long run. This program impacts standard Xbox Wireless Controller models and the Xbox Elite Series 2 Wireless Controller.</p><p>The Microsoft store offers replacement boards, sticks, buttons, covers and more, handling issues from stick drifting to stuck shoulder buttons and beyond. In the past, you’d have to replace the gamepad entirely or rely on risky third-party fixes. Prices range from $24 for button sets to $60 for a circuit board and motor assembly unit. You can even replace the vibration motor for $35. Additionally, replacement cases are available, but only in black and white.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The program is already live, <a href="https://twitter.com/WorkWombatman/status/1686114452708724736?s=20"><ins>according to product lead Brad Rossetti,</ins></a> so if you have any broken Xbox controllers laying about, now is the time to see about fixing them up.

## Amazon's virtual healthcare service is now available in every state

<p>Amazon's approach to digital healthcare is now available nationwide. The company has <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-clinic-available-nationwide">expanded</a> Clinic to all 50 states as well as Washington, DC. You can also have clinician video visits across the country in addition to text-only conversations in 34 states. Both avenues are available through Amazon's website and mobile app.</p><p>As launched in November, Clinic is meant to provide treatment for over 30 commonplace health issues such as birth control prescriptions, migraines and pink eye. You choose a telehealth provider, fill out an intake form and get in touch with a clinician. You don't need an appointment or insurance, and the cost is visible before you reach out. Amazon hopes you'll fill any necessary prescriptions through its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-pharmacy-134356646.html">in-house Pharmacy</a> service, but any third-party pharmacy is an option. Help with more conditions is due in the &quot;coming months,&quot; the company adds.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Clinic is part of a long-running effort on Amazon's part to cover many aspects of healthcare. It <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-28-amazon-buys-pillpack-healthcare-online-pharmacy.html">bought PillPack</a> (the basis of Pharmacy) in 2018, and between 2019 and 2022 provided a Care telehealth service to its own employees as well as other companies. Amazon more recently closed its $3.9 billion <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-completes-one-medical-acquisition-163431975.html">purchase of One Medical</a>, turning it into a primary healthcare provider with a physical presence, virtual options and lab testing. In the right circumstances, you might only have to interact with Amazon businesses.</p><p>These moves have drawn scrutiny from regulators. Although the Federal Trade Commission said it wouldn't challenge the One Medical acquisition in February, it warned that it was still investigating the merger for possible anti-competition and privacy issues that come from access to health data. The Commission said it might challenge the deal later if it found concerns. For now, though, Amazon's healthcare ambitions aren't facing major resistance — it's now an alternative to conventional clinics, at least for everyday problems.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/amazons-virtual-healthcare-service-is-now-available-in-every-state-171827351.html?src=rss

## The best smart light bulbs for 2023
 - [https://www.engadget.com/best-smart-led-light-bulbs-143022856.html?src=rss](https://www.engadget.com/best-smart-led-light-bulbs-143022856.html?src=rss)

<p>One of the best places to start when building a smart home ecosystem is smart light bulbs. Not only are they relatively low priced compared to other IoT gadgets, often costing between $10 and $50 a bulb, but they can also completely change the feel of your home. You can go from boring and analogue to colorful and automated within minutes, and there are endless possibilities when it comes to using smart light bulbs to create funky-colored light scenes, setting schedules and more.</p><p>But like the rest of the smart home space over the last few years, there are now more players in smart lighting than ever before. We tested out some of the most popular smart lights on the market and found that most of them are quite good, but there are differences in compatibility, color quality and mobile app usability that are worth considering before deciding which smart bulb system will be the best buy for your home.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>What to look for in smart light bulbs</h2><h3>Connectivity (To hub or not to hub)</h3><p>One of the biggest appeals of smart lights is being able to control them from your phone. Most of them are able to do so by connecting to it via WiFi or Bluetooth, or via an external hub, which handles the connection for them. Bluetooth connectivity limits the range in which you’ll be able to control the light, so it’s only best for a limited number of bulbs and ones you don’t expect to control when you’re away.</p><p>WiFi smart lights are easy to set up and can be cheaper overall since they don’t require a hub to connect them. However, having something like a central Zigbee hub can make your whole system more reliable since its connection is separate from your home’s WiFi network. For that reason, hub-based bulbs tend to be more expandable, so we mainly recommend those if you want to eventually have dozens of smart lights around your home.</p><h3>White or color?</h3><p>Most smart bulbs you’ll find today are “white and color” bulbs, meaning they can glow in vibrant blues, pinks, greens and everything in between, as well as shine with different temperatures of white. But there are some white-only bulbs out there, and they are often a bit more affordable than their color counterparts. While we recommend springing for the white-and-color devices, if you’d prefer white only, make sure you’re getting a bulb that can span the color temperature spectrum (typically from about 2000 to 5000 Kelvin), offering you various levels of warm and cool white light.</p><h3>App features</h3><p>One of the perks of smart lights is the amount of control you have over them thanks to their various app-connected capabilities. Most companion apps let you do things like set lighting schedules, group individual lights into room designations and create your own custom light “scenes” with different colors. But we have seen other features that aren’t as ubiquitous like vacation mode for automatically turning lights on and off to enhance your home security, and sync with media, which changes the colors of lights depending on the music you’re listening to or the game you’re currently live-streaming.</p><h3>Smart home compatibility</h3><p>If you use a smart assistant like Amazon’s Alexa or the Google Assistant regularly, make sure the smart lights you get work with your favorite. All of the bulbs we tested supported both Amazon’s and Google’s virtual assistants, allowing you to use voice commands to turn lights on and off, dim them and more. The wildcard here is Siri and Apple’s HomeKit; while numerous smart bulbs have added HomeKit to their list of compatible connections, not all lights support Apple’s smart home system.</p><h3>Expandability</h3><p>We alluded to this above, but you’ll want to consider how many smart lights you eventually want in your home. Some brands and lighting systems are easier to expand than others, and we generally recommend going for hub-based bulbs if you plan on putting smart lights in every room in your home. If you’re only looking to deck out your home office or living room with some fancy lights, WiFi options should serve you well. Thankfully, these are some of the most affordable smart home devices you can get, so even if you don’t have a clear answer to this question now, you can reconsider your options down the line if you do decide to outfit your home with multiple smart bulbs.</p><h2>Best overall: Philips Hue White + Color Ambiance</h2><p></p><p>If you’ve done any research into smart lights, you’ve probably come across <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9QaGlsaXBzLUh1ZS1CbHVldG9vdGgtY29tcGF0aWJsZS1Bc3Npc3RhbnQvZHAvQjA3UVY5WEI4Nz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1ncy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYzE3ZGQ0MmEtMjdjOS00ZWJjLWJkYzAtOWE0M2M2ZDI0YzA4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAQKLiQdjMORv95p41OUxPUt4jIe2cH5EvxXjRYP4fZ7j&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPhilips-Hue-Bluetooth-compatible-Assistant%2Fdp%2FB07QV9XB87">Philips Hue bulbs</a>. The range is popular for a variety of reasons, and we agree they’re the best smart light bulbs you can get thanks to their wide compatibility, easy to use mobile app and their expandability. Particularly, if you know you want to outfit more than one room in your home with these IoT devices, Philips Hue is the way to go.</p><p>The first thing that’s important to know about Hue bulbs is that they are now Bluetooth enabled. That means you can buy a few to try out first, then easily expand your system with a hub when you want to add more lights to your home. Previously, the hub was required for any and all lights, but now it’s much easier to dip your toe into the range before fully taking the plunge.</p><p>Like all of the other smart lights we tested, you only need to screw in a Philips Hue bulb, turn on your light, and follow the instructions in the mobile app to start using it. Even if you only have the lights in one room to start, we still recommend grouping them into their own “room” in the Hue app so you can easily control the entire space’s environment at once.</p><p><a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9QaGlsaXBzLUh1ZS1CbHVldG9vdGgtY29tcGF0aWJsZS1Bc3Npc3RhbnQvZHAvQjA3UVY5WEI4Nz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1ncy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYzE3ZGQ0MmEtMjdjOS00ZWJjLWJkYzAtOWE0M2M2ZDI0YzA4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAQKLiQdjMORv95p41OUxPUt4jIe2cH5EvxXjRYP4fZ7j&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPhilips-Hue-Bluetooth-compatible-Assistant%2Fdp%2FB07QV9XB87">Hue’s White + Color</a> bulbs provide a range of warm to cool whites and millions of colors to experiment with in your smart home. Colors are rich and vibrant, and Philips’ pre-programmed scenes, such as Energize, Bright and Relax, let you quickly emulate your old “dumb” lights with different warmth levels of white light. You can pick from a number of color scenes in the app, too, but it’s also easy to create your own color temperature. So if you’ve always wanted to flood your office with a rainbow of vibrant colors while you’re live-streaming on Twitch, you can find the precise presets you want, save them and then turn them on with just a few taps in the app.</p><p>The Hue app is pretty easy to use, and the bulbs support voice commands from Amazon’s Alexa and the Google Assistant. That means you don’t even have to open the app to control your lights; you can simply use voice control and say “Alexa, turn off the bedroom lights” and only the lights in that designated room will extinguish. You’ll be able to add up to 10 bulbs to your system using Bluetooth alone – at which point you’ll have to add a Philips Hue hub into the mix to support up to 50 lights. The hub also enables things like HomeKit connectivity, light schedules and automations, home and away modes and syncing with movies and music.</p><p>Arguably the most useful of those features is automations, which lets you set on/off schedules for your lights, including automatically turning the lights off when you leave the house. It’s understandable why Philips would make these few features exclusive to those with Hue hubs – adding a hub into the mix makes the system more reliable, allowing you to do more with increasing numbers of connected lights, plus it will encourage many to invest in a hub and more Hue bulbs over time. We like Hue’s hub not only for its reliability, but also because it allows finer and more flexible control over your devices. So if you’re on vacation and want to turn on your living room lights to see what’s going on, you can do that.</p><p>Expandability goes beyond the number of lights you have in your smart home: It also includes multiple smart bulbs you can install outside, too. The Hue range has a ton of indoor and outdoor light bulbs to choose from, including recessed lights, outdoor pedestal and flood lights, light strips and more. It’s one of the few ranges available today that gives you a ton of options to make every bulb in and out of your home smart, which is important to consider if you know you want to go all in on the smart light front.</p><p>But that brings us to the biggest downside of Philips Hue, which is the price. Hue bulbs are on the expensive side, with a two-pack of White + Color Ambiance bulbs costing $80. If you’re looking for cheap bulbs to test out smart lighting, some of our other top picks below, like the Kasa smart light bulb, will be better choices since most of them have lower prices per bulb. However, if smart lighting is something you want to invest in going forward, we recommend going with one of Philips’ Hue starter kits: the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9QaGlsaXBzLUh1ZS1TdGFydGVyLUNvbXBhdGlibGUtQXNzaXN0YW50L2RwL0IwOTVLUVNYWUg_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZ3MtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImMxN2RkNDJhLTI3YzktNGViYy1iZGMwLTlhNDNjNmQyNGMwOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQL-pui21HZF1vUC5rEEgjkEBsX6zl4Zo8WKfF5yhXES&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPhilips-Hue-Starter-Compatible-Assistant%2Fdp%2FB095KQSXYH">White + Color Ambiance starter kit</a>, including three bulbs, a hub and a smart button, comes in at $180, which is cheaper than if you were to buy all of those components separately.</p><h2>Runner up: LIFX Color A19</h2><p></p><p>Overall, LIFX’s color smart lights are similar to Hue’s White + Ambiance bulbs in that they’re easy to set up, they offer striking, saturated colors and work with three major platforms: Alexa, Google Assistant and HomeKit. But the main difference is the LIFX bulbs are WiFi only, so you can’t connect them to a hub even if you wanted to, and some are slightly more expensive than Hue devices.

While that may not mean much to you, it’s worth mentioning because mobile apps are the way most people interact with their smart lights on a daily basis. The homepage features all of the room groups in your household, along with the names of the lights in each room. You can easily turn a whole room, or a specific light, on with just a tap, and do the same for all of the lights in your smart home.</p><p>LIFX lights support scheduling, so you can program lights to work for you so you rarely (if ever) have to control them manually, plus there are a plethora of scenes and effects to choose from. While all of the color lights we tried had pre-made scenes or presets ready to go in the app, Philips Hue and LIFX clearly had the most out of them all. Personally, I found LIFX’s scenes and additional effects to be a bit more fun and engaging than Hue’s. You can pick from scenes like “spooky” or “pastel” and use effects like “strobe” if you want to make your living room feel a bit more like a nightclub. While most people probably won’t use these niche scenes and effects on a regular basis, they’re great perks to have when you’re entertaining or just want to set the right vibe for your next movie night or game-streaming session.</p><p>LIFX has a <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9zdG9yZXMvbm9kZS85MDI5ODMwMDExP2llPVVURjgmZmllbGQtbGJyX2JyYW5kc19icm93c2UtYmluPUxJRlgmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZ3MtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImMxN2RkNDJhLTI3YzktNGViYy1iZGMwLTlhNDNjNmQyNGMwOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYADPCWjJK-X-559-kI6ulGQTqZzglIKB8lkURHJg2M-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fstores%2Fnode%2F9029830011%3Fie%3DUTF8%26field-lbr_brands_browse-bin%3DLIFX">number of products</a> in its ecosystem, from standard A19 bulbs to lightstrips to candles. It has switches, too, so you can physically control your smart lights if you wish. But Philips Hue has all of those options too and more, including not just switches, but standalone floor lamps, outdoor spotlights, downlights, light bars and motion sensors. You’ll have more options with Hue if you want to convert all of your home’s lights to smart ones, and have multiple ways to control them, too.</p><h2>Best budget: TP-Link Kasa Smart WiFi Light Bulb</h2><p></p><p>TP-Link’s Kasa brand is known for its solid yet affordable smart home devices and its smart lights are no different. We tested out the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9LYXNhLVNtYXJ0LUNoYW5naW5nLURpbW1hYmxlLUNvbXBhdGlibGUvZHAvQjA4VEI4WjVIRj90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1ncy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYzE3ZGQ0MmEtMjdjOS00ZWJjLWJkYzAtOWE0M2M2ZDI0YzA4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAUs4nz_l_NZXPfTFwuGgGq-hzPaiJLEsPQWCXOZyBmq9&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FKasa-Smart-Changing-Dimmable-Compatible%2Fdp%2FB08TB8Z5HF">WiFi-only multicolor smart light bulbs</a> and found them easy to install and use, and they provide a bunch of features at an affordable price; a four-pack of multicolor bulbs will only set you back $40.</p><p>Besides having a simple installation process, Kasa’s multicolor smart lights stayed reliably connected the whole time we tested them and the companion mobile app is simple and clean. All of the main functions for each light live in that bulb’s dedicated page in the app, allowing you to change brightness, white levels, color, schedules and more without navigating through a bunch of different menus. Changing colors is nearly instantaneous, and the light changes as you drag your finger across the color wheel in the app. Editing the four presets you’re able to save takes only a few taps, as does grouping multiple bulbs into rooms and creating lighting schedules. For the latter, if you do set on/off schedules, the app will show you the next step in that schedule (i.e., off at 8:35pm) next to each individual light.</p><p>There’s also a handy “usage” section in each light’s page that shows you the bulb’s energy use over time, plus an estimate of how much energy you’re saving by using a smart light instead of a regular one. This is something that would be fun to observe over many weeks and months of using these bulbs, especially if conserving energy is one of the main reasons you invested in smart lights in the first place.</p><p>TP-Link claims you can connect “unlimited” smart devices to its mobile app, which technically means you can have as many Kasa smart lights in your home as you’d like. We only tested a few together, so we can’t say for sure how dozens of connected devices would affect app speed and light response time. These are WiFi-only bulbs, which means connecting them to a Zigbee hub isn’t an option, so keep that in mind before deciding to invest in a house-full of these gadgets. It’s also worth noting that these lights aren’t compatible with Apple’s HomeKit, although you can control them using Alexa and Google Assistant commands.</p><h2>Best all white: LIFX White E26</h2><p></p><p>Maybe you don’t want to bother with colored lights. If that’s the case, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwODY1VFJENUw_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZ3MtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImMxN2RkNDJhLTI3YzktNGViYy1iZGMwLTlhNDNjNmQyNGMwOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAASTMwC65XBa7Qey988tEYbgemsv7y1T9uqIA_rsoF_fZ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0865TRD5L">LIFX’s White E26</a> is your best bet. You get all of the non-color features in the mobile app that we explained above, including schedules and virtual assistant controls, but in a more basic LED light bulb that only costs $10.</p><p>My biggest gripe is that it doesn’t span the cool-to-warm temperature range that other white bulbs do. Rather, you’re stuck with just one shade of white: 2700K, which is on the warmer side. This makes the LIFX bulb better for intimate settings like a bedroom or a living room, but since it’s not overly warm, it could work in a home office, too. It’s also dimmable, so you can control its brightness.</p><p>If you have a specific use case in mind for your smart lights that doesn’t involve a rainbow of colors, then a LIFX bulb will more than suffice. They would work well in a child’s room, for instance, allowing you to set wake-up and sleep schedules that gradually turn on and off the lights, or in a home office where you just want a bit more control over your lights without extra frills.</p><h2>Honorable mention: Sengled Smart Light Bulbs</h2><p></p><p><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TZW5nbGVkLUNoYW5naW5nLUFzc2lzdGFudC1SZXF1aXJlZC1FcXVpdmFsZW50L2RwL0IwOTFGUVJCVEw_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZ3MtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImMxN2RkNDJhLTI3YzktNGViYy1iZGMwLTlhNDNjNmQyNGMwOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAW-a8TYKAV1J3qL9HPNPmEIUF5E60u00YSgxGK6nrQv_&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSengled-Changing-Assistant-Required-Equivalent%2Fdp%2FB091FQRBTL">Sengled’s Smart Light Bulbs</a> deserve a shout because they’re essentially more affordable versions of the best bulbs mentioned here, just with a few compromises.

The nearly two-foot tall lamp can be customized with up to three colors of light at once, plus it supports a full array of cool and warm hues as well. Shine it towards a wall to set the mood with colored lights during your game night, or use it to give yourself sufficient lighting during your next Zoom meeting – you can make it as fun or as practical as you need. It also supports effects like “candle” and “fireplace,” both of which produce moving light that emulates flickering flames. We also appreciate that the Signe lamp is a totally standalone device, like most of Philips’ new Hue bulbs: you don’t need a Hue bridge to use it. But if you have one, you’ll be able to do things like control the lamp when you’re away from home.</p><p>The Signe lamp is a splurge, though, coming in at over $200.

You can expect to pay $25 to $50 for a basic, multi-color, 16.4-foot light strip and the price will go up from there depending on how many segments the strip has, the color range it supports, if it’s WiFi-connected and other additional features. Govee’s M1 Light Strip is on the higher end of the spectrum, coming in at $110 for 16.4 feet of light, but it still costs less than arguably its biggest competitor: Philips’ Hue Light Strips, which come in at <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9QaGlsaXBzLUh1ZS1CbHVldG9vdGgtTGlnaHRzdHJpcC1Db21wYXRpYmxlL2RwL0IwOENLSldTRlM_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZ3MtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImMxN2RkNDJhLTI3YzktNGViYy1iZGMwLTlhNDNjNmQyNGMwOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAVU4xTfnggJbb54IFCX6ZX3PoPetCquQIsVjGf5G4vFI&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPhilips-Hue-Bluetooth-Lightstrip-Compatible%2Fdp%2FB08CKJWSFS">$80 per 6-foot strip</a>.</p><p>I was impressed by not only the color spectrum the M1 Light Strip supports, but also how bright it is. This strip gets almost blinding, and I usually had it operating at just 75 percent of its full brightness. While you can’t control each individual light on the strip, you can customize all 15 segments in the Govee app.</p><p>The sheer number of options and effects Govee provides is remarkable: the “effects lab” gives you pre-made basic colors, scenes that mimic sunrises, starry nights, different kinds of movies like thrillers and dramas, gaming genres and more. On top of that, you can make your own custom scenes (and choose to share them with others in Govee’s Explore page) as well as your favorite colors and hues that you can save for frequent use. The strip’s color is saturated and vibrant – combine that with the overall brightness and it was easily able to give my office an attractive, ambient glow when positioned around the periphery of my couch.</p><p>Aside from the higher price tag, my only other complaint about the M1 light strip is actually Govee’s mobile app. It’s a bit chaotic and takes some getting used to, so it might not be the best choice for anyone that wants something basic. However, I was able to get the hang of all the controls, and then some, after about a half hour.

<p>Ford has resumed F-150 Lightning production after a retooling period. Following a six-week shutdown to expand and prep the plant for quicker turnarounds and higher output, the automaker has <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2023/08/01/ford-restarts-expanded-rouge-electric-vehicle-center--f-150-ligh.html">reopened</a> its Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan. That should help Ford meet the demand for the popular EV after its recent <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-drops-f-150-lightning-prices-by-up-to-10000-140701730.html">$10,000 price drop</a> spurred a sixfold spike in orders.</p><p>Starting this fall, the automaker says the Dearborn plant can produce the F-150 Lightning at an annualized rate of 150,000 units — triple its previous output. Although it will still fall well short of that number this year due to the shutdown and slower speeds pre-revamp (it estimates 70,000+ units for 2023), the company expects the production spike to make waiting times less of a headache. Ford recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-expects-to-reach-its-ev-production-goal-a-year-later-than-planned-101804539.html">adjusted expectations</a>, bumping back its estimated date for reaching its goal of 600,000 total EVs produced to sometime in 2024 from its original 2023 target date.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="A Ford line graph showing anticipated (rising) production of the F-150 Lightning for the rest of 2023." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/88ef0220-3086-11ee-bf9f-a85cffab7932" style="height: 2812px; width: 5000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Ford</div></figure><p>Ford says the factory’s improved capacity will also help it to offer more popular trim levels like <a href="https://www.ford.com/trucks/f150/f150-lightning/models/f150-xlt/">XLT</a>. In addition, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-f-150-lightning-pro-electric-pickup-100041871.html">Lightning Pro units</a> are now available through retail channels, and “new trim levels are set to join the lineup soon.”</p><p>Part of the plant’s output boost will come from new equipment. The Rouge Electric Vehicle Center now has machines to “automatically measure and validate exterior body fit for margin and flushness precision,” a first for Ford’s North American plants. The factory also has an extra station to validate wheel alignment and headlamp aim for driver-assist tech. In addition, the plant now employs 1,200 new workers, a likely boon for productivity and the Detroit-area economy.</p><p>Ford says it’s also increasing output at its nearby Rawsonville Components Plant and Van Dyke (Mich.) Electric Powertrain Center. The automaker expects battery pack and EV power units to “match the scale of F-150 Lightning assembly at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center.”&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ford-resumes-f-150-lightning-production-after-a-six-week-shutdown-163541170.html?src=rss

<p>The official Fitbit app is <a href="https://blog.google/products/fitbit/introducing-the-all-new-fitbit-app/"><ins>getting a major redesign</ins></a> with an emphasis on simplicity, personalization and motivation. The refresh splits everything into three tabs, to reduce visual clutter and make it easier to use. There’s the Today tab, the Coach tab and the You tab, each offering access to unique metrics and activities.</p><p>The Today tab collects all of your preferred stats and metrics so you can check everything out at a glance. This is fully customizable, so change up the displayed stats to suit your personal goals. Though called “Today”, you also get a bird’s eye view into health trends over the past month or year, via charts, graphics and icons.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Coach tab is all about motivation, with curated lists of workouts and mindfulness sessions. You can filter these workouts based on your availability, owned equipment and overall fitness and health goals. Fitbit Premium subscribers can access more content than free subscribers, such as dance cardio classes.</p><p>Finally, there’s the You tab. This is where you access your achievement badges and various progress metrics, in addition to connecting with other Fitbit users and changing up personal information. The company says everything here is kept private and won’t even be leveraged for Google ads data.</p><p>It’s worth noting that the refresh will not change which features are free and which are only for premium subscribers. The redesign is already going out to select Fitbit users as a beta product before the global launch this fall. There are more changes coming to the platform in the future. Starting next year, users will have to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-users-can-log-in-with-their-google-accounts-starting-on-june-6th-173329923.html"><ins>login to Fitbit apps with Google credentials,</ins></a> as the Fitbit brand is being phased out.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-app-gets-a-major-redesign-with-an-emphasis-on-simplicity-161412464.html?src=rss

## YouTube is adding more creator tools to Shorts to help it take on TikTok

<p>YouTube has released several creation tools for Shorts, such as ones that give users the ability to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-shorts-remix-videos-web-tablet-viewer-170010114.html">remix most videos</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-shorts-voiceover-narration-190351673.html">add voiceovers</a>, ever since it was launched in an effort to make it a more veritable TikTok rival. Now, the video-hosting platform is in the process of expanding its arsenal of creation tools even further. The first addition is Collab, which lets users record short-form videos in a split screen format with other Shorts or regular clips.&nbsp;</p><p>All users have to do to create a Collab video from an eligible Short or YouTube content is to hit Remix and then choose the new format. TikTok, of course has long had a split-screen effect that lets people divide the screen into multiple frames. Well, YouTube's Collab is rolling out today and will continue making its way to users coming weeks to challenge TikTok's version. iOS users are getting the format first, but Android users will follow.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The platform is also adding a tool that lets users quickly build off of and remix existing Shorts. They only have to tap the Remix button and select &quot;use sound&quot; in the Shorts player to automatically surface the audio and effect used in the clip they just watched. Users can then apply both sound and effect to their own post. In addition, YouTube will start testing a new recomposition tool in the coming weeks designed to simplify transforming horizontal videos into vertical Shorts. The tool will give creators a way to adjust the layout, zoom and crop of the segment they want to use after they've chosen a video to remix, giving them an easy way to reshare old footage in a new format. They can also choose to use the new split screen effect for the video they're recomposing.&nbsp;</p><p>Aside from these new creator tools, YouTube is testing a new mobile-first vertical live experience for viewers, as well. Audiences will be able to see previews of vertical live videos in the Shorts feed with this new experience, and if they tap to expand it, they'll find a scrollable feed of more live videos. YouTube is hoping this could boost discoverability for creators and calls it is a great opportunity to make money for those who recently joined its Partner Program. The new mobile-first experience will make its way to more and more viewers over the coming months.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/youtube-is-adding-more-creator-tools-to-shorts-to-help-it-take-on-tiktok-160023789.html?src=rss

<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/nhtsa/"><ins>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</ins></a> is investigating <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/tesla/"><ins>Tesla</ins></a> following a dozen reports about 2023 model year Model 3 and Model Y vehicles encountering steering issues. The agency opened a preliminary evaluation (PE) after drivers claimed they were either unable to steer their vehicle or that they suffered a loss of power steering.</p><p>&quot;Five reports indicate an inability to steer the vehicle. Seven additional reports cite loss of power steering resulting in increased effort to control the vehicle,&quot; <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2023/INOA-PE23014-4415.PDF">the NHTSA said</a>. &quot;A PE has been opened to assess the scope, frequency, manufacturing processes and severity associated with this condition.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>No deaths or injuries were reported in connection with these incidents, as <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/08/01/tesla-under-investigation-nhtsa-over-12-reports-model-3-y-losing-steering-control/"><em><ins>Electrek</ins></em></a> notes, but one led to a crash or fire. Some 280,000 vehicles are included in the scope of the investigation, which could result in a recall. Tesla doesn't have a communications department that can be reached for comment.</p><p>This is hardly the first time that the NHTSA has looked into Tesla safety issues.

The company has also caught the attention of the Department of Justice. In January, Tesla <a href="https://www.engadget.com/justice-department-tesla-autopilot-full-self-driving-subpoena-165637940.html">confirmed</a> that the DOJ requested documents related to Tesla's Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features.</p><p>Meanwhile, last month, Tesla <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2023/07/24/tesla-recalls-model-s-x-and-y-for-misaligned-cameras/"><ins>issued</ins></a> a voluntary recall for more than 1,300 Model S, X and Y vehicles it built this year due to misaligned cameras. The company <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2023/RCLRPT-23V489-8374.PDF"><ins>said</ins></a> the issue &quot;may cause certain active safety features to be unavailable, including automatic emergency braking, forward collision warning and lane keeping assist, without alerting the driver to their unavailability.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/us-regulators-are-investigating-tesla-over-model-3-and-model-y-steering-issues-154015361.html?src=rss

<p>It’s been a year and change since the release of the enhanced Nintendo Switch OLED model, with its larger 7-inch screen, longer battery life and some much-needed design tweaks. While it’s not a must-have upgrade from the original, it is the best buy for first-time Switch owners. But whether you’re a newcomer to the system or upgrading from the five-year old first-gen model, you’ll want to make the most of your $350 investment with a few well-chosen Switch OLED accessories. We’ve outlined our favorites below.</p><h2>SanDisk microSD card</h2><p></p><p>With only 64GB of on-board storage, you’re going to want to get a microSD for your Switch OLED to store downloaded games, save files and screenshots. And with the redesigned slot it’s easier than ever to put it in or take it out of the system, too. You can use pretty much any microSD card with your Nintendo Switch, but the Nintendo-branded ones from SanDisk are solid, and you can get a <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TYW5EaXNrLU1pY3JvU0RYQy1NZW1vcnktTmludGVuZG8tU3dpdGNoL2RwL0IwN1FENlI1TDc_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZTMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImQxMzY0NTg2LTk0YjYtNDBjNC1iZjc4LTg5Y2Q3NjA0MTNkMiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAd6KwZ5HHeGtuSJ7cxDBQ54pm9TbsbtHkN9I325d3-oW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSanDisk-MicroSDXC-Memory-Nintendo-Switch%2Fdp%2FB07QD6R5L7">256GB model</a> at a pretty affordable rate right now.

But if you don’t have one, or find it a little too bulky, I’m still going to recommend the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDg2TTREUTdSP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWUzLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMTM2NDU4Ni05NGI2LTQwYzQtYmY3OC04OWNkNzYwNDEzZDIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAeytyEJQ6Ovw4V7ceCavLWliAQazQQkpUXyrZ1afskEf&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB086M4DQ7R">Arctis 1</a> from SteelSeries as a good option for the Switch. It sounds great, is super comfortable and stylish, and the included USB-C dongle is still easier than connecting to the console via Bluetooth. At $100, it’s also reasonably priced for a gaming headset.</p><h2>Razer Barracuda X</h2><p></p><p>Like the Arctis 1, the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9SYXplci1CYXJyYWN1ZGEtV2lyZWxlc3MtTXVsdGktUGxhdGZvcm0tSGVhZHNldC9kcC9CMDk2TjZRNTFOP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWUzLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMTM2NDU4Ni05NGI2LTQwYzQtYmY3OC04OWNkNzYwNDEzZDIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAcbeCc2JabIRygBuI8rjyAawv696zhBKHhfGgjcTEryG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FRazer-Barracuda-Wireless-Multi-Platform-Headset%2Fdp%2FB096N6Q51N">Barracuda X</a> uses a USB-C dongle to connect to your console. Unlike the Arctis, though, this headset comes in assorted colors like quartz pink and white, the latter of which matches the Switch OLED’s panda-colored Joy-Cons. Aside from that, it’s just as solid as the Arctis 1, with 40mm drivers and a super light but sturdy design that feels and looks great on your noggin.</p><h2>PowerA Joy-Con charging dock</h2><p></p><p>One thing that Switch owners quickly realize is that if they want to play games with friends, they’re going to want some extra Joy-Cons on hand. But the Switch console itself can only charge one set at a time. Why not increase your capacity by adding this charging station to your setup (it plugs right into your Switch dock), with space for <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Db250cm9sbGVyLUNoYXJnaW5nLU5pbnRlbmRvLVN3aXRjaC1XaXJlbGVzcy1yZWNoYXJnZWFibGUtZHAtQjBCNVJZVkhYRy9kcC9CMEI1UllWSFhHP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWUzLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMTM2NDU4Ni05NGI2LTQwYzQtYmY3OC04OWNkNzYwNDEzZDIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZyhePN_DJ2YekxBugDKtPkNp28FM16Dgc0Js8i4q2_X&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FController-Charging-Nintendo-Switch-Wireless-rechargeable-dp-B0B5RYVHXG%2Fdp%2FB0B5RYVHXG">two Joy-Cons and a Pro controller</a>, which means you'll never have to deal with a dead Switch controller again. That’s perfect for games like <em>Towerfall</em>, <em>Party Golf</em>, <em>Super Bomberman R</em> and of course, <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>.</p><h2>Turtle Beach Battle Buds</h2><p></p><p>If you’re an on-the-go Switch gamer who’d rather not drag around a full-size headset but still craves high-end audio, know that most accessory makers are releasing earbuds made especially for gaming – though your existing wireless earbuds will still, in many cases, do a bang-up job. If you do want a dedicated pair made especially with gaming in mind, these <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9UdXJ0bGUtQmF0dGxlLUdhbWluZy1IZWFkc2V0LU1vYmlsZS1OaW50ZW5kby9kcC9CMDdNTUYyQ0ZOP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWUzLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMTM2NDU4Ni05NGI2LTQwYzQtYmY3OC04OWNkNzYwNDEzZDIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQ1we0_PTAn7NPsQcm-73fm3m9BIT6uXDGG1_mNdg73b&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FTurtle-Battle-Gaming-Headset-Mobile-Nintendo%2Fdp%2FB07MMF2CFN">wired buds from Turtle Beach</a> have sports tips so they’ll stay firmly in your ear while you’re walking or shouting at the competition on the included mic. But you may not have to shout, since that microphone is a detachable model that you can bend toward your mouth, instead of the usual fiddly in-line mic that most wired headphones come with these days.</p><h2>iVoler Tempered Glass Screen Protector</h2><p></p><p>The Switch OLED’s screen is beautiful enough that you’ll definitely want to give it an extra layer of protection. Because it’s slightly larger than the screen on the standard Switch, you’ll need to make sure you get a screen protector that’s specifically made for the OLED model, and I also recommend a tempered glass kit because it’s more durable than plastic.

## Meta's Oversight Board recommends stronger rules on gender-based violence

<p>Meta's Oversight Board is <a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/813577783586004-oversight-board-overturns-meta-s-original-decision-in-image-of-gender-based-violence-case/">calling</a> for changes to the social media giant's policies on gender-based violence. In addition to overturning the decision to preserve a Facebook post making light of domestic abuse, the panel has recommended Meta create policies cracking down on content that &quot;normalizes&quot; the violence by celebrating, justifying or mocking it. The board members also want Meta to clarify that its anti-harassment provisions include serious physical injuries as &quot;medical condition[s].&quot;</p><p>The findings come in response to a 2021 Iraq post 'joking' about a woman being beaten for making a mistake writing to her husband. The woman in the photo was a Syrian activist, and the post contained a hashtag used for pro-women discussions in the country. A Facebook user reported the content three times in February this year, but the report was automatically closed as the complaint wasn't reviewed. Meta only pulled the post after the Oversight Board selected the user's appeal for review.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The board is concerned the post wouldn't have violated Meta's policies on harassment if the woman were fictional or couldn't be identified. Moreover, the post went untouched for two years and didn't get a human review when it was originally reported earlier this year. This implies Meta &quot;does not prioritize&quot; this kind of violation, according to the board.</p><p>We've asked Meta for comment on the ruling, including whether or not it intends to implement the recommendations. The company has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/metas-oversight-board-says-the-companys-rules-are-slowly-changing-for-the-better-100059192.html">adopted Oversight Board recommendations</a> before, although it has been criticized for an alleged lack of transparency and delays in sharing information.</p><p>The Oversight Board has requested significant changes to Meta's behavior in recent months. It asked Meta to rethink the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oversight-board-asks-meta-to-reassess-what-covid-19-misinformation-it-removes-120032687.html">COVID-19 misinformation it removes</a>, and has pressed for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-oversight-board-instagram-trans-non-binary-bare-chest-covered-nipples-161509910.html">more inclusive rules on adult nudity</a>.

<p>There’s some positive news for those who have been holding off from buying a new gaming console, as well as folks who had trouble finding a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/playstation-5/"><ins>PlayStation 5</ins></a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/xbox-series-x/"><ins>Xbox Series X</ins></a> since the systems arrived in late 2020. Not only are both consoles more readily available these days after Sony and Microsoft resolved some of their supply issues, they're each available for $50 less than usual. That means the disk version of the PS5 has <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c481f8c7-0c3b-4dbb-afc6-0373c0dea6e3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Monoprice&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjNDgxZjhjNy0wYzNiLTRkYmItYWZjNi0wMzczYzBkZWE2ZTMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubW9ub3ByaWNlLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0P3BfaWQ9NDQ5MTcmIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkZTIyNDI2NC04MDgxLTRhMzQtYTc0Yy1lOGY1MDdjMzFjN2QifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAbbi79cdy0tFrdB65km7x6UFPnSRZAKWpK5lOM5BzkX8&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monoprice.com%2Fproduct%3Fp_id%3D44917%26"><ins>dropped from $500 to $450</ins></a>, which is the console's first discount in the US outside of bundles that include a game.</p><p></p><p>When the PS5 debuted, we gave it a score of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-playstation-5-review-130048353.html"><ins>87 in our review</ins></a>, but Sony has improved the experience since then by rolling out many new features. For instance, in a new beta version of the PS5 firmware that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-ps5-beta-adds-support-for-dolby-atmos-8tb-ssd-storage-and-more-113512511.html"><ins>just went live</ins></a>, Sony added support for Dolby Atmos, increased the additional M.2 SSD storage capacity up to 8TB and introduced a welcome controller accessibility feature.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The PS5’s DualSense controller is an excellent bit of kit. It deepens the feeling of immersion thanks to features like adaptive triggers (which add tension to things like pulling back a bow’s drawstring) and haptic feedback, which can replicate sensations like falling rain or footsteps through vibration tech.</p><p>None of this would matter without great games and the PS5 now has many of them, including <em>Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart</em>, <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>, <em>Elden Ring</em> and many more. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-spider-man-2-story-trailer-teases-more-venom-more-villains-and-more-drama-040056520.html"><em><ins>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</ins></em></a> is right around the corner as well. The PlayStation Plus program now includes an extensive library of games you can access for a monthly or annual fee on the Extra and Premium tiers, while all but a few PlayStation 4 games work on the system as well.</p><p>As for the Series X, that's compatible with hundreds of Xbox games going all the way back to Microsoft's original 2001 console. Xbox Game Pass is a major selling point for the system, as the subscription offers access to all of Microsoft's first-party games on the day of release (perhaps <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-puts-internal-trial-over-microsoft-activision-deal-on-hold-230513417.html"><ins>soon to include</ins></a> Activision Blizzard titles like the Call of Duty series), as well as a wide range of third-party games.</p><p>The Xbox Series X, which is also <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=b1bb23c9-a2d4-4e4e-bfac-7a560ebe7641&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Dell&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJiMWJiMjNjOS1hMmQ0LTRlNGUtYmZhYy03YTU2MGViZTc2NDEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGVsbC5jb20vZW4tdXMvc2hvcC9taWNyb3NvZnQteGJveC1zZXJpZXMteC1nYW1lLWNvbnNvbGUtOGstaGRyLTEtdGItc3NkL2FwZC9hYjM2NTUwMy9nYW1pbmctZ2FtaW5nLWFjY2Vzc29yaWVzPyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZGUyMjQyNjQtODA4MS00YTM0LWE3NGMtZThmNTA3YzMxYzdkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAbr_IRnTKyY7TuH50EFkpvIdG95NwJi97aSaQ31AcmJ_&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fmicrosoft-xbox-series-x-game-console-8k-hdr-1-tb-ssd%2Fapd%2Fab365503%2Fgaming-gaming-accessories%3F"><ins>on sale for $50 off at $450</ins></a>, is the most powerful gaming console around (we initially <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-series-x-review-microsoft-140045437.html"><ins>gave it a review score of 87</ins></a>). It too has its fair share of quality console exclusives, from the Halo series and <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em> to <em>Hi-Fi Rush </em>and <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>.

It’s worth considering whether the PS5 or Xbox Series X’s exclusives are more compelling to you, how invested you are in the PlayStation or Xbox ecosystems already and if the lure of PlayStation Plus or Xbox Game Pass is compelling enough to pull you in either direction. Perhaps you already have one console and were waiting for a deal on the other. Nonetheless, these are solid discounts on two consoles that have actually become <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-is-increasing-xbox-series-x-and-game-pass-prices-in-most-countries-182635680.html"><ins>more expensive</ins></a> in many markets over <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-raises-playstation-5-pricing-082732792.html"><ins>the last year</ins></a>.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter and </em><a href="https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src"><em>subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em> for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ps5-and-xbox-series-x-consoles-are-50-off-right-now-144035016.html?src=rss

<p>If you’ve ever been derailed from an on-time departure by a set of lost keys or misplaced wallet, you’ll benefit from a Bluetooth tracker. These small gadgets attach to your stuff and use your smartphone to keep tabs on where they are. There aren’t a ton of players in the field yet, but we tested out some of the most popular options to find our top picks and help you decide which is the best Bluetooth tracker for you.</p><h2>What to look for in a Bluetooth tracker</h2><p>Bluetooth trackers are small discs or cards that rely on short-range, low-energy wireless signals to communicate with your smartphone. Attach one to your stuff and, if it’s in range, your phone can “ring” the chip so you can find it. These tracking devices offer other features like separation alerts to tell you when you’ve left a tagged item behind, or where a lost item was last detected. Some can even tap into a larger network of smartphones to track down your device when you’re out of range. Depending on what you want the tracker to do, there are a few specs to look for when deciding which to get.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h3><strong>Device compatibility</strong></h3><p>Like most things from the folks in Cupertino, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtags-trackers-first-look-hands-on-130036848.html">AirTags</a> only work with products in the Apple ecosystem. The company has opened up <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cHBvcnQuYXBwbGUuY29tL2VuLXVzL0hUMjExMzMxIzp-OnRleHQ9U3VwcG9ydGVkJTIwdGhpcmQlMkRwYXJ0eSUyMHByb2R1Y3RzJnRleHQ9VGhlJTIwZm9sbG93aW5nJTIwcHJvZHVjdHMlMjBhcmUlMjBjb21wYXRpYmxlLHdpdGglMjB0aGUlMjBTREQlMjBGaW5kaW5nJTIwc3lzdGVtIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2M2IxMjRmOC0yNjVkLTQ5YTctOWQxMS01MmU2NzFiZWMwYzYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAcs6otxYTaPJkVFkCTdYh98uCdvHslF2hmlbiiNv9pbj&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com%2Fen-us%2FHT211331%23%3A%7E%3Atext%3DSupported%2520third%252Dparty%2520products%26text%3DThe%2520following%2520products%2520are%2520compatible%2Cwith%2520the%2520SDD%2520Finding%2520system&amp;uuid=fDQCO0BMVEVlXsrB8153">access</a> to its Find My network to third-party manufacturers, including Chipolo, though. Its One Spot and Card Spot finders work with Apple's large tracking network, but only pair with Apple devices. Chipolo’s classic trackers will work with either Android or Apple devices, as will Tile trackers.</p><h3><strong>Finding network</strong></h3><p>Crowd-sourced finding capabilities are what make headlines, with stories about recovering stolen <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/05/09/airtag-stolen-gear/">equipment</a> or tracking lost luggage <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/couple-tracking-lost-luggage-journey-apple-airtag-wow-viewers-1733614">across the globe</a>. Using anonymous signals that ping other people’s devices, these Bluetooth tracking devices can potentially tell you where a tagged item is, even if your smartphone is out of Bluetooth range. Apple’s Find My network is by far the largest, with over a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-count-over-1-billion-045552737.html">billion</a> iPhones in service all running Apple’s Find My app by default. So unless an iPhone user opts out, their phone silently acts as a location detector for any nearby AirTags.</p><p>While Android phones <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/android-dominates-globally-but-apples-gaining-ground-102346830.html">outnumber</a> iPhones globally, they don’t have a similar, unified network yet. During this year’s I/O conference, Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-io-2023-everything-announced-at-the-event-193758196.html">announced</a> upcoming upgrades to its Find My Device network, starting with better anti-stalking measures, some of which it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-rolls-out-anti-stalking-measures-for-airtag-and-other-bluetooth-trackers-194936293.html">recently debuted</a>. The complete roll out of the FindMy-rivaling network has been delayed until the end of this year. We know of a few trackers that will take advantage of the new system and once they’re available, we’ll test them out and update this guide.</p><p>In the meantime, Tile offers the second-largest finding grid, with every smartphone that runs the Tile app acting as incognito locators. After Life360 <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=7d4ad158-ef3c-4076-800c-a48ae1e8937e&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Life360&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI3ZDRhZDE1OC1lZjNjLTQwNzYtODAwYy1hNDhhZTFlODkzN2UiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGlmZTM2MC5jb20vYmxvZy90aWxlLWpvaW5zLWxpZmUzNjAvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2M2IxMjRmOC0yNjVkLTQ5YTctOWQxMS01MmU2NzFiZWMwYzYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUTqZnrTq_j9lZCvmXv0wW7fTw_pRZ9WHKm3VdGluDyk&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.life360.com%2Fblog%2Ftile-joins-life360%2F">acquired</a> Tile, the 47 million users of that app were added to the 50 million existing Tile users, creating a sizable network.</p><p>In our tests, AirTags offered nearly real-time location data and were quickest to find items abandoned in spots around Albuquerque, including a bar, bookstore and coffee shop in Nob Hill, along with various outdoor hangouts on UNM’s campus. Bluetooth tracking Tiles were able to locate our lost items most of the time, though not with the same pin-point accuracy as AirTags. Chipolo’s Spot trackers operate on the same Find My network and perform on par with the AirTags.</p><p>Chipolo’s classic trackers, on the other hand, don’t have much of a crowd-sourced network to speak of. Yet as we used the trackers, the size of the finding network started to feel less important in the face of typical, everyday use cases. It was their ability to out-perform in every other way that boosted Chipolo’s classic trackers to the top of our list.</p><figure><img alt="An assortment of bluetooth trackers arranged in a grid on a wooden background. Trackers include black Tile trackers in various shapes, two silver and white AirTag trackers and a round blue Chipolo tracker attached to a set of keys with a multitool key chain.

A separation alert lets you know when you’ve traveled too far from your tagged items, which is useful if you want to make sure your laptop bag, or jacket or umbrella always comes with you when you leave the house.</p><p>These notifications work when you’re out and about too. If you’ve got a tracker in your wallet and walk out of a restaurant without it, the separation alert should kick in, resulting in fewer lost items. This feature also tells you where your tagged item and phone were last paired, allowing you to retrace your steps if you happen to miss the alert.</p><p>Each tracker handles left-behind items differently. Both AirTags and Chipolo include the feature by default. Tile trackers require a yearly <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9a27b27f-6486-47c7-9cdc-0c4040bd9690&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Tile&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5YTI3YjI3Zi02NDg2LTQ3YzctOWNkYy0wYzQwNDBiZDk2OTAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGlsZS5jb20vZW4tdXMvcGxhbnMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjYzYjEyNGY4LTI2NWQtNDlhNy05ZDExLTUyZTY3MWJlYzBjNiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAS3gS-ptxLvKi9M17Nfp7mkMV8Ej-2v8XP5fJ2qSd8Fr&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tile.com%2Fen-us%2Fplans&amp;uuid=Jg5abHgGg2GW29IW10154">subscription</a> to enable the alerts (currently $30 per year). Both AirTags and Tiles allow you to turn off separation alerts at certain locations, meaning you can set your home as a “safe” place where items can be left behind, but alerts will still trigger elsewhere. Chipolo doesn’t offer safe locations, but you can toggle out-of-range alerts on a per-item basis.</p><p>In our tests, the Chipolo sent an alert after we got between 250 and 450 feet away from our tagged item. AirTags alerted us between the 600- and 1,400-foot mark. And Tiles sent a notification after about an average of 1,500 feet. Tile notifications were not consistent on an iPhone, but worked well when operating with an Android phone.</p><h3><strong>Connectivity, volume and design</strong></h3><p>The feature you may use most often is the simple “find my keys” function. If you have your phone, but no idea where your tagged keys are, you can tap a button in the tracker’s app to make the tracker ring. Tile and Chipolo classic trackers will also let you double click the device itself to make your phone ring, but AirTags and Chipolos running on the Find My app don’t offer this feature.</p><p>The volume of the tracker may determine whether you can find an item buried in your couch cushions or in a noisy room. AirTags have a reputation for being on the quiet side, and that aligned with what we saw (measuring roughly 65 decibels). Chipolo’s keychain-style tags, both the Apple-only version and the device-agnostic version, and the Tile Slim wallet tracker were the loudest, measuring between 83 and 85 decibels.</p><p>Design will determine what you can attach the tracker to. AirTags are small, smooth discs that have no way of securing to anything without accessories, which are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html">numerous</a>, but that is an additional cost to consider. Both Chipolo and Tile offer trackers with holes that easily attach to your key ring, and both companies also offer card-shaped versions designed to fit in your wallet. Batteries are replaceable for AirTags, Chipolo One and Tile Pro. Tile Mate and all card-shaped trackers don’t have replaceable batteries, which means you’ll have to replace the entire unit whenever it dies. <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3BlYmJsZWJlZS5jb20vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2M2IxMjRmOC0yNjVkLTQ5YTctOWQxMS01MmU2NzFiZWMwYzYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYa8jjhHxuQK8FJhfeAcbhRErxJiGnQTNySgp26XM-Ya&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fpebblebee.com%2F">Pebblebee</a> trackers are rechargeable. We’re currently testing them and will update this guide to share how they stack up.</p><h3><strong>Stalking and stealing</strong></h3><p>AirTags have recently gotten a lot of attention for bad actors <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtag-stalking-police-reports-190022315.html">planting</a> them on people in order to stalk them. While this fact may not influence your buying decision, any discussion of Bluetooth trackers should note what steps <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cHBvcnQuYXBwbGUuY29tL2VuLXVzL0hUMjEyMjI3IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2M2IxMjRmOC0yNjVkLTQ5YTctOWQxMS01MmU2NzFiZWMwYzYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAe9wp3dHWI77shmqqj-OBkY-SU2Wc70hbQ2fXQmBCFSp&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com%2Fen-us%2FHT212227">Apple</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-rolls-out-anti-stalking-measures-for-airtag-and-other-bluetooth-trackers-194936293.html">Google</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tile-tag-scan-and-secure-anti-stalking-175822554.html">Tile</a> have taken to address the issue. If an AirTag is detected <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-is-convinced-my-dog-is-stalking-me-143100932.html">moving with you</a> and apart from its owner, the device will ring to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-update-hidden-airtags-easier-to-locate-092003140.html">alert you</a> of its presence. Whether you have an iPhone or an Android phone, as long as you have location services and Bluetooth turned on, you’ll automatically get an alert with no further steps required. Tile offers a similar feature through its standard app, and it doesn’t require a Tile account to search for suspicious nearby trackers.</p><p>Recently, Tile launched a feature called Anti-Theft Mode, which enables you to render one of its trackers undetectable by others. That means if someone steals your tagged item, they won’t be able to use the anti-stalking features to find its precise location and disable the tracker. Of course, that potentially makes a Tile easier to use as a stalking device, so in order to enable the feature, you have to verify your ID and agree to a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tile-thinks-a-1-million-fine-will-deter-stalkers-from-using-its-trackers-181857358.html">$1 million penalty</a> for misuse.</p><p>In general, a Bluetooth tracker may or may not be the best option for combating theft. Anecdotal stories abound in which people have recovered stolen goods using a tracker — but other tales are more <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/exclusive-man-tracks-his-stolen-motorcycle-in-brooklyn-then-gets-in-fight-with-suspected-thieves/?uuid=msvElrzASiWkkNSa23031">cautionary</a>. Apple still doesn’t promote its trackers or finding networks as a way to deal with theft. GPS trackers, on the other hand, are typically marketed for just that purpose.</p><h2>How we tested</h2><p>Before deciding on which trackers to test, we researched the field, looking at user reviews on Amazon, Best Buy and other retailers, along with discussions on sites like Reddit. We also checked out what other publications had to say on the matter before narrowing down our picks to Apple AirTag, Tile and Chipolo trackers.</p><p>Here’s the full list of every tracker we

Card</a></p></li></ul><p>After acquiring the trackers, I tested each one over the course of a few weeks using both an iPhone 11 and a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. I recreated likely user experiences, such as losing and leaving items behind at home and out in the city. I planted trackers at different spots near downtown Albuquerque, mostly concentrated in and around the University of New Mexico and the surrounding neighborhood of Nob Hill. Each test was performed multiple times, both while walking and driving and I used the measure distance feature on Google Maps to track footage for alerts. I paid attention to how easy the app was to use, how reliable the phone-to-tracker connection was and any other perks and drawbacks that came up during regular use.</p><h2>Best Overall: Chipolo One</h2><p></p><p>Hands-on testing is great at smashing assumptions, and that’s what happened with the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9DaGlwb2xvLU9ORS1Mb3VkZXN0LVJlc2lzdGFudC1CbHVldG9vdGgvZHAvQjA4MzJZQ1dIVj90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1sYS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNjNiMTI0ZjgtMjY1ZC00OWE3LTlkMTEtNTJlNjcxYmVjMGM2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAXaM4TT3CVg8yhY8pi_F3NLzIp7Xm13WreEHB94PoILh&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FChipolo-ONE-Loudest-Resistant-Bluetooth%2Fdp%2FB0832YCWHV">Chipolo One</a>. This tracker’s crowd-sourced finding network cannot compare with Apple’s AirTag or Tile. In fact, when I left the Chipolo for 24 hours just outside the busy student union at UNM, I was never alerted that a member of the Chipolo <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2NoaXBvbG8ubmV0L2VuLXVzL3BhZ2VzL2NvbW11bml0eSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNjNiMTI0ZjgtMjY1ZC00OWE3LTlkMTEtNTJlNjcxYmVjMGM2In0&amp;signature=AQAAATI2APUmcRWwTBLUMtXwsVojoxx3nxv3q3QP9ocvldHZ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fchipolo.net%2Fen-us%2Fpages%2Fcommunity&amp;uuid=Tu5i2PguJiSroJue24173">community</a> had detected my item. But as I used it and pictured how most people would use a tracker on a daily basis, the device proved its worth and earned its spot on my keyring.</p><p>The One is a small and colorful plastic disc with a hole. It works with both Apple and Android devices and requires an app which is simple to use and easily pairs new trackers. The app and tracking experience on an iPhone and a Galaxy phone were nearly identical, working equally well on both platforms. It rang the loudest of all the trackers, so lost items were quickly found around the house. Unlike other trackers, there was never a delay between pressing the Ring to Find button and hearing the trill. The ring delay for AirTag was never more than a few seconds and Tiles would generally connect and ring after no more than ten seconds. While that’s not a deal-breaking delay, it could add to the stress of rushing out the door.</p><p>Where the Chipolo One truly set itself apart was with its separation alerts. I would only get a half to two blocks away (or an average of 350 feet) before getting an alert asking if I’d forgotten an item. Neither AirTag nor Tile ever beat Chipolo to the punch. The alerts were consistent whether I was forgetting an item at home, at a coffee shop, or inside my car.</p><p>As far as losing stuff out in the wild, it will get you back to the spot where your phone and tracker were last paired. That means if you miss an alert or don’t have them turned on, Chipolo will give you directions (via your maps app) and take you right to where you left your item. In one test, I had a friend hide the tracker nearby when I wasn't looking. I left the area and returned hours later, using the last location information to lead me within a few feet of the tracker’s precise location. Ringing the tracker then made it easy to find. Of course, if someone walks off with your tracked item, the Chipolo will be harder pressed to help you out.</p><p>If you’re concerned about lost <a href="https://www.engadget.com/faa-apple-airtags-allowed-in-checked-baggage-181915494.html">luggage</a> when you travel or if you worry you may lose things on trains or buses, this isn’t the tracker for you because of its much smaller finding network. But if you’re looking for a dead simple way to find your keys and make sure your jacket leaves the bar when you do, the Chipolo One is hard to beat.</p><h2>Best for iPhones: AirTag</h2><p></p><p><a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BcHBsZS1NWDUzMkFNLUEtQWlyVGFnL2RwL0IwOTMzQlZLNlQvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWxhLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2M2IxMjRmOC0yNjVkLTQ5YTctOWQxMS01MmU2NzFiZWMwYzYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAc5ZzLNwjJG6mIN9XaVHPNjo0oFXgfIKSOkLROnt2XGg&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-MX532AM-A-AirTag%2Fdp%2FB0933BVK6T%2F&amp;uuid=4lk4kIolrELtraHg28175">AirTags</a> work with iOS' Find My app, so they don’t require any additional downloads. If you’ve used the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-share-location-iphone-143002231.html">Find My app</a> before, you’ll likely understand how this works. These are the quietest of the trackers we tested and each time you press the Play Sound button, the tags only ring for seven seconds. You’ll need to keep pressing if you don’t find your item right away and AirTags can’t be used to ring your phone.</p><p>As for separation alerts, AirTags were consistent, always delivering a “left behind” alert when I traveled about 1,200 feet away, or about three square blocks, without an item. You can turn off separation alerts for any given tracker, as well as designate certain locations, such as your home or workplace, as exceptions for the notifications.</p><p>One feature that AirTags have that no other tag offers is the ability to tap into the ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless protocol. This allows you to play a fun game of hot and cold with an item when it’s within about 25 feet of your iPhone. Directional arrows and a diminishing distance meter on your iPhone’s screen point you to an item without having to ring it. This worked reliably about 75 percent of the time in my tests; sometimes it was just easier to ring the item when the directional finding couldn’t keep a lock on the tracker.</p><p>UWB is supported by iPhone models 11 and later and while newer Galaxy and Pixel phones also support UWB, no Android-compatible tracker has yet been released. In 2021, Tile <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tile-pro-ultra-wideband-tracker-new-devices-100025451.html">announced</a> one that would, but has since missed its promised release window of “early 2022.”</p><p>AirTag’s ability to locate a lost item out in the city is almost eerie. I had someone (who was not carrying an iPhone) take my bike with a tracker hidden under the seat to a location a little over a half mile away. I set out a few minutes later and toggled on Notify When Found in the Find My app. Within three minutes, I received a notification that the bike had been “seen” near an address. Tapping on Directions navigates to Apple Maps, which took me to a spot about 30 feet from the bike. Had it been obscured from view, I could have then used the Find Nearby button to activate the UWB locating features. Ringing the tag was too quiet to hear on the sidewalk.</p><p>If you want the same scary-precise community finding features, but with a louder ring and a hole in the tracker, the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9DaGlwb2xvLUNhcmQtU3BvdC1CbHVldG9vdGgtVHJhY2tlci9kcC9CMDlaVFo0N0s0P3JlZl89YXN0X3N0b19kcCZ0aD0xJnBzYz0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWxhLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2M2IxMjRmOC0yNjVkLTQ5YTctOWQxMS01MmU2NzFiZWMwYzYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAeFl8KreCE_w4Lj5S59_oP7B-RPSj1oVEOUvrPy8g3FF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FChipolo-Card-Spot-Bluetooth-Tracker%2Fdp%2FB09ZTZ47K4%3Fref_%3Dast_sto_dp%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1&amp;uuid=hjdRjnNYxcmrOvp929176">Chipolo One Spot</a> is a solid option. It doesn’t offer UWB capabilities, however, and the separation alerts are the same as with AirTags (letting you get 1,200 feet away before a ping, versus an average of 350 feet with our top rec, Chipolo One classic).</p><h2>Best for Android: Tile Pro</h2><p></p><p>Tile will work with either Android or Apple devices, but the experience is much better on Android. Certain connectivity issues and a lack of alerts that plagued the iPhone experience did not show up in tests with the Galaxy phone. One caveat to note is that Tile requires a subscription to enable separation alerts. Tile Premium goes for $3 per month or $30 per year and includes location history and item reimbursement of up to $100 on items that you register with the company, they’ll also send out a fresh battery once a year. Tile stands out as the only tracker company offering reimbursement — even without a subscription, they’ll pay out <a href="https://tileteam.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051207613-Tile-Basic-Reimbursement">up to $25</a> for items that you register with them.</p><p>The <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9UaWxlLVBvd2VyZnVsLUJsdWV0b290aC1XYXRlci1SZXNpc3RhbnQtQ29tcGF0aWJsZS9kcC9CMDlCMldMUldYP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWxhLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2M2IxMjRmOC0yNjVkLTQ5YTctOWQxMS01MmU2NzFiZWMwYzYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdXOdxTBtCAHitdmq1AiKoc-LvadwEGqV7YICfAZdRqN&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FTile-Powerful-Bluetooth-Water-Resistant-Compatible%2Fdp%2FB09B2WLRWX&amp;uuid=5vr4VqSpWIAMS3ju32179">Tile Pro</a> is a key-fob shaped device with a metal keychain hole that feels sturdy. The Pro’s ring was just a few decibels quieter than the Tile Mate (78 versus 82 decibels), but the connectivity range was better with the Pro, and it was more accurate in finder network tests. On top of that, this is the only current Tile device with a replaceable battery, which lasts about one year.</p><p>For the lost-item tests, I had a friend take the Pro to random locations. After turning on the Notify When Found feature, an alert would arrive between five and ten minutes later saying my lost item was “found by the community.” The map details were typically accurate within about 100 feet or so, though it occasionally thought the Tile was at a business next door to where it actually was. Without the UWB feature, precision finding of an item was trickier. In one test, the tracker ended up in a noisy pub. While the directions pointed me to the right location, it would have been difficult to find the item if I hadn’t spotted my friend, as the ring function was useless among the din.</p><h2>Best wallet tracker: Tile Slim</h2><p></p><p>The <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9UaWxlLTEtUGFjay1CbHVldG9vdGgtV2F0ZXItUmVzaXN0YW50LUNvbXBhdGlibGUvZHAvQjA5QjJOWUozVD90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1sYS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNjNiMTI0ZjgtMjY1ZC00OWE3LTlkMTEtNTJlNjcxYmVjMGM2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAX3Nom_KP_hYwX1AS5BU_ZI5CO7F4TF2k3EiqENgBpfZ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FTile-1-Pack-Bluetooth-Water-Resistant-Compatible%2Fdp%2FB09B2NYJ3T&amp;uuid=8WzIVx2N4Tb90fyI35181">Tile Slim</a> is louder than both the Pro and the Mate, and nearly equals the loudest tracker we tested, the Chipolo One. It works with both Android and Apple devices and its thick credit card shape fits in the slots of a typical wallet (though it often won’t connect when inside an RFID-blocking wallet). The separation alerts you’ll get if you pay for a Tile subscription activate at about the same distance as the Tile Pro, letting you get around 1,500 feet away before pinging you about a left-behind item. When using an iPhone with Tile trackers, separation alerts rarely came and connectivity between the phone and tracker was spotty at best, even in close proximity.

## The Morning After: Water-soluble circuit boards could have a huge impact on e-waste

<p>German semiconductor maker Infineon Technologies announced it’s making printed circuit boards (PCBs) that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/water-soluble-circuit-boards-could-cut-carbon-footprints-by-60-percent-201845709.html">dissolve in water</a>. Sourced from UK startup Jiva Materials, the plant-based Soluboard could provide a new way for the tech industry to reduce electronic waste.</p><p>Jiva’s biodegradable PCB is made of natural fibers and a halogen-free polymer with a much lower carbon footprint. A team at the University of Washington College of Engineering and Microsoft Research created a mouse using a Soluboard PCB as its core. The researchers found the Soluboard dissolved in hot water in under six minutes. The process also makes retrieving the valuable metals attached to it easier. “After [it dissolves], we’re left with the chips and circuit traces, which we can filter out,” said UW assistant professor Vikram Iyer, who worked on the mouse project.</p><p>It’s early days for the technology. And maybe I’m a Debby-downer (and clumsy), but it could increase the drama of me spilling coffee on my laptop.</p><p>– Mat Smith</p><p>​​<em>You can get these reports delivered daily direct to your inbox. </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em>Subscribe right here!</em></a></p><p>​​</p><h3>The biggest stories you might have missed</h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-eco-friendly-phone-cases-150016494.html">The best eco-friendly phone cases for 2023</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/mazda-stops-selling-its-only-ev-in-the-us-182657731.html">Mazda stops selling its only EV in the US </a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/this-free-plugin-uses-ai-to-generate-music-samples-from-text-prompts-165058168.html">This free plugin uses AI to generate music samples from text prompts</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-safety-driver-involved-in-fatal-self-driving-car-crash-pleads-guilty-212616187.html">Uber safety driver involved in fatal self-driving car crash pleads guilty</a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-amp-is-trying-to-reinvent-radio-194634553.html">Amazon’s Amp tries to reinvent radio as an app</a></h2><h3>Over a year since launching invite-only, it goes mainstream.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-amp-is-trying-to-reinvent-radio-194634553.html"><figure><img alt="TMA" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/7282dd80-3050-11ee-9dff-bbc7581a965b" style="height: 451px; width: 675px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure></a><p>Last spring, Amazon launched its live audio-streaming platform, Amp.

<p>After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-threatens-to-sue-anti-hate-group-over-its-research-125645342.html">threatening to do so</a>, X Corp (aka Twitter) has filed a lawsuit against The Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-01/musk-s-x-sues-non-profit-that-tracks-hate-speech-over-report"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> has reported. It claimed that the anti-hate group is illegally &quot;scraping&quot; its servers and cherry picking hateful posts as part of &quot;a scare campaign to drive away advertisers,&quot; according to documents filed in San Francisco federal court. X Corp. is asking for unspecified monetary damages and an injunction barring the CCDH from accessing its data.</p><p>The Center <a href="https://counterhate.com/research/twitter-fails-to-act-on-twitter-blue-accounts-tweeting-hate/">published</a> a research article in June asserting that X allowed explicitly racist and homophobic posts despite policies to the contrary, even after they'd been reported. However, X responded that the CCDH used poor methodology, and failed to study all 500 million posts on the service each day. It also maintained that the Center was taking funding from competitors or foreign governments as part of an &quot;ulterior agenda,&quot; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/31/technology/twitter-x-center-for-countering-digital-hate.html">according</a> to <em>The New York Times</em>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In a new <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2023/a-new-era-of-transparency-for-twitter1">blog post</a> called &quot;Protecting the public’s right to free expression,&quot; Twitter/X explained its reasoning for filing a legal claim against CCDH. &quot;X is a free public service funded largely by advertisers. Through the CCDH's scare campaign and its ongoing pressure on brands to prevent the public’s access to free expression, the CCDH is actively working to prevent public dialogue,&quot; the post states.</p><p>It went on to note that the CCDH scraped its data, accessing it without authorization from <a href="https://partners.twitter.com/en/partners/brandwatch">Brandwatch</a>, a Twitter partner that provides &quot;consumer &amp; market insights,&quot; &quot;brand monitoring&quot; and more. It added that CCDH's &quot;'research' cited in a<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-19/twitter-s-surge-in-harmful-content-a-barrier-to-advertiser-return"></a><a href="https://twitter.com/technology/status/1681610101348528129?s=46">Bloomberg article</a> 'contained metrics used out of context to make unsubstantiated assertions about X (formerly Twitter).'&quot;</p><p>&quot;That’s why X has filed a legal claim against the CCDH and its backers,&quot; it stated. It also accused the CCDH of &quot;targeting people on all platforms who speak about issues the CCDH doesn’t agree with,&quot; &quot;attempting to coerce the deplatforming of users whose views do not conform to the CCDH's ideological agenda&quot; and more.&nbsp;</p><p>In a <a href="https://counterhate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Letter-to-A.-Spiro-from-R.-Kaplan-re-CCDH.pdf">letter</a> published earlier today, the CCDH countered Twitter's earlier allegations. It noted that it never claimed to be conducting a comprehensive study, and documented the methodology it did use. It wrote that X didn't provide any specific examples, and said it doesn't accept funding from companies or governments. It further stated that it &quot;will not be bullied,&quot; will continue publishing its research and that a lawsuit with &quot;frivolous&quot; claims could prove risky.</p><p>&quot;The public has the right to know if and how @ElonMusk’s leadership has led to more hate speech on Twitter,” the nonprofit tweeted earlier. &quot;By threatening us, Musk is trying to hide the truth about his own failures. Platforms must be held accountable for spreading hate &amp; lies.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/elon-musks-x-corp-sues-anti-hate-group-over-its-research-060156126.html?src=rss

## 'Bomb Rush Cyberfunk' arrives on the PlayStation and Xbox in September

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-indie-world-august-2021-showcase-192608269.html"><em>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</em></a>, the upcoming game from Team Reptile with major <em>Jet Set Radio</em> vibes, is also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jet-set-radio-like-bomb-rush-cyberfunk-gets-september-release-on-playstation">heading</a> to PlayStation and Xbox. It was initially announced for Switch and PC with a release date of August 18th. Now, the developer has revealed that PlayStation and Xbox gamers only have to wait a couple of weeks more, because the title will be released for their consoles two weeks later, on September 1st.&nbsp;</p><p>Team Reptile describes <em>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</em> as a world wherein &quot;self-styled graffiti crews equipped with personal boostpacks are battling each other for control of the streets.&quot; Its theme, gameplay and art style are all reminiscent of the Dreamcast classic <em>Jet Set Radio</em>, which was released back in 2000. In the upcoming funkstyle game, players can explore the five main boroughs of New Amsterdam to spray graffiti, do dance battles and face off rival crews.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>They can also expand their crew by finding new members around the city as they go around on inline skates, skateboards or bikes. (And yes, they can use the environment to do tricks.) Another layer of gameplay is that players have to evade militarized police as they move, which gets harder to do the longer they play because law enforcement scales up the more they vandalize the streets.&nbsp;</p><div id="851aac8555de4b3da7bb4135eec26952"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/bomb-rush-cyberfunk-arrives-on-the-playstation-and-xbox-in-september-045525170.html?src=rss
