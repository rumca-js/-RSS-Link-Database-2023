Woot Woot! We are getting started on a really fun week with some IRL building of a Flywheel prototype. The prototype is designed to answer the age old question: Can I play tight music using a very strong flywheel? The new flywheel have 20x more moment of inertia compared to the MMX Flywheel.

We are recording at the wonderful location of Siegfrieds Mechanical Music Museum in Rudesheim Am Rhein, Germany. The museum will livestream the upcoming Wintergatan meetup 4-6 august on their youtube channel, check it out here: https://www.youtube.com/@Musikkabinett
