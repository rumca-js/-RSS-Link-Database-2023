While turning the iconic PlayStation game into a TV series might sound practically impossible, the creators clearly understood and aced the assignment: Craft a narrative that incorporates vehicular combat, a killer clown, quasi-supernatural elements, and nostalgia for late-'90s/early-'00s American culture, and top it off with a dollop of dark humor. Be stupid and crass, but not incoherent.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><em><strong>Warning: The following contains spoilers for the new Twisted Metal series on Peacock. If you haven't seen it yet, steer clear.</strong></em></p><p dir=\"ltr\">And wouldn't you know, they pulled it off--at least partly due to them hiring the right people. Developers Paul Wernick and Rhet Reese, who also wrote Zombieland and Deadpool, specialize in this type of self-aware, fourth-wall-breaking, smartass humor.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Ironic fan service is enough to suck you in and keep you watching, at least for the first few episodes. But halfway through the 10-episode season, you also realize that you've come to care for these bizarre characters, especially co-leads John Doe (Anthony Mackie) and Quiet (Stephanie Beatriz). And by the time there's a multi-car rumble in a massive parking lot, and Sweet Tooth lights his head on fire, you're completely invested--on a visceral level, sure, but on an emotional level, as well.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Still, as much as we loved the story being told and the characters telling it, there's of course tons of Easter eggs for fans of the video game franchise in there, too. Here are the 56 best references to Twisted Metal and Easter eggs that we were able to track down while watching the Peacock series. Did we miss any? Let us know in the comments.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. Ridgepointe</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172475-1.png\" /><br /><h3><p>When we first meet John Doe, he's crashing through shops in the Ridgepointe Centre mall. This is a central location in the Twisted Metal: Black (2001) level \"Suburbs.\"</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. OG Game</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172476-2.png\" /><br /><h3><p>One of the stores that John Doe crashes through is an EB Games, and the case for the original Twisted Metal (1995) lands on his windshield.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. Pink Trails</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172477-3.png\" /><br /><h3><p>In Twisted Metal: Black (2001), the homing missiles create pink smoke trails, which distinguishes them from the fire missiles, which have orange trails. We see both trail types in the Peacock series, depending on which missiles the combatants are firing.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. Shotgun</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172479-4.png\" /><br /><h3><p>John Doe uses a sawed-off shotgun in the opening scene. Twisted Metal (2012) was the first game in the franchise to distinguish mounted guns from sidearms, which you could customize before each new level.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. Three Rivers</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172482-6.png\" /><br /><h3><p>The Three Rivers outpost that John delivers dog food to is a reference to the real-life Three Rivers community in Tulane County, California, which is bordered on its north side by national parks. If you look closely, you can see a national park sign that reads \"South Entrance,\" implying that the Three Rivers community fenced itself in or near the park when the power went down.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. Calypso is Real?</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172483-7.png\" /><br /><h3><p>There are multiple graffitied signs in the series that state \"CALYPSO IS REAL.\" In the games, Calypso is the mysterious benefactor who organizes the Twisted Metal tournaments and grants the winners' wishes, often in darkly ironic ways. At the very end of the Peacock series, we see Calypso's back, and he appears to have the long black hair that he wore in Twisted Metal (2012).</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. Talon</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172484-8.png\" /><br /><h3><p>Based on the color scheme, the downed helicopter in this shot is Talon, an unlockable vehicle in Twisted Metal (2012).</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>8. John Doe</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172485-9.png\" /><br /><h3><p>In the series, John Doe doesn't remember his childhood\u2014his earliest memories are from when he was in a car accident as a child. In Twisted Metal: Black (2001), the John Doe character also has amnesia. The main difference here is that in Black, he had an entire adult life and discovers that he used to be an undercover FBI agent.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>9. Evelin</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172486-10.png\" /><br /><h3><p>Evelin, which is John's original car in the series, is a 2002 Subaru WRX. It has no equivalent in the games.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>10. Raven</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172487-11.png\" /><br /><h3><p>In the series, Raven is the villainous leader of New San Francisco. In Twisted Metal: Black (2001), Raven is a teenage girl who enters the tournament to avenge her best friend Kelly, who drowned when bullies threw her into the water. She drives the Shadow car in the game.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>11. Kelly</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172488-12.png\" /><br /><h3><p>The bar where Raven meets John is called Kelly's, a clear reference to her deceased friend.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>12. Doll</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172489-13.png\" /><br /><h3><p>This shot from the final episode, where we see Raven sewing a doll, is a reference to her ending in Twisted Metal: Black (2001), where she uses a voodoo doll to torment and eventually kill Kelly's bullies.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>13. Shadow</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172490-14.png\" /><br /><h3><p>In the series, the Shadow car is not driven by Raven. Instead, it is driven by new character Quiet and her brother Loud.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>14. Agent Stone</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172491-15.png\" /><br /><h3><p>In the series, Agent Stone is a crazed mall cop who dishes out a twisted brand of justice to the outsiders he pulls over. In Twisted Metal: Black (2001), he is a virtuous man, who feels deep guilt and shame for killing a child in a raid gone wrong. In both timelines, he drives the Outlaw car.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>15. Chief Bratton</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172492-16.png\" /><br /><h3><p>The police chief that Agent Stone mentions during his monologue to Quiet is a real person. His name is William Bratton, and he served two terms as New York City's police commissioner. He is the current Chair of the Homeland Security Advisory Council.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>16. Agent Shepard</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172493-17.png\" /><br /><h3><p>Stone's lackey in the series is based on Agent Shepard, who drives the Crimson Fury car in Twisted Metal: Head-On (2005). In the game, he is a principled federal agent who enters the tournament to bring Calypso to justice.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>17. Brother and Sister</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172494-18.png\" /><br /><h3><p>In the series, the two cops who obey Agent Stone are Carl and Jamie Roberts. They are the first two drivers for the Outlaw car in Twisted Metal (1995) and Twisted Metal 2 (1996), respectively.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>18. Mapmaker</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172495-19.png\" /><br /><h3><p>The color scheme and style of the maps that John retrieves from the Mapmaker recalls the Green Book travel guide--a real-life book that helped keep black travelers safe in the mid-1900s by cautioning readers against sundown towns and other unsafe locations.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>19. God Mode</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172512-20.png\" /><br /><h3><p>When Evelin stalls on the road, John Doe inputs the invincibility code from Twisted Metal 2 (1996) to get her moving again.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>20. Sweet Tooth</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172516-21.png\" /><br /><h3><p>The Peacock series gives Sweet Tooth his classic ice cream truck. In Twisted Metal (2012), the bobblehead on top detaches and can be used as a flaming homing missile.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>21. Samoa Joe</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172540-22.png\" /><br /><h3><p>Sweet Tooth is brought to life by two actors. Will Arnett performs the voice, and professional wrestler Samoa Joe performs the body and movement.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>22. Blackfield Asylum</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172544-23.png\" /><br /><h3><p>We see that Sweet Tooth used to be a resident of Blackfield Asylum, and his real name is M. Kane. In Twisted Metal: Black, Calypso recruits all of his contestants from Blackfield Asylum. In Twisted Metal (2012), we learn that Marcus Kane is the former name that Sweet Tooth used before he became a serial killer, after which he began calling himself Needles.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>23. Paper Bag</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172545-24.png\" /><br /><h3><p>Sweet Tooth's best friend is Harold, a brown paper bag. It's bizarre, but it is actually taken directly from the original game, in which Sweet Tooth requests Harold from Calypso after winning his tournament.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>24. Checkered Suit</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172546-25.png\" /><br /><h3><p>Sweet Tooth's white checkered suit that he wears to his \"show\" is based on his costume in Twisted Metal III (1998).</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>25. Sisqo</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172547-26.png\" /><br /><h3><p>One of the best jokes in the second episode is when John Doe and Sweet Tooth share their mutual appreciation for Sisqo's \"The Thong Song,\" and Unleash the Dragon (1999), Sisqo's solo debut album. \"Unleash the Dragon\" shipped over 5 million copies within four years of its initial release.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>26. Remote Control</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172548-27.png\" /><br /><h3><p>The RC cars outside of Radioshack during the Agent Stone flashback are a reference to Twisted Metal: Small Brawl (2001), a more family-friendly version of Twisted Metal that pits remote-controlled cars against one another instead of real cars.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>27. Teddy Bear</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172549-28.png\" /><br /><h3><p>In the series, Agent Stone accidentally kills a child, and a bloody teddy bear implies what happened instead of showing us the body. Twisted Metal: Black (2001) uses the same visual motif of a bloody teddy bear when Agent Stone accidentally shoots a child during a botched raid.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>28. Mike &amp; Stu</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172550-29.png\" /><br /><h3><p>Mike and Stu are two of Agent Stone's failed lackeys in the series. In the game, they are the drivers for the monster truck called Hammerhead in Twisted Metal 2 (1996).</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>29. Thrills and Spills</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172551-30.png\" /><br /><h3><p>Agent Stone agrees to meet Quiet at the Thrills and Spills Adventure Park, which is also a deathmatch level in Twisted Metal (2012).</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>30. Watykins</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172552-31.png\" /><br /><h3><p>John Doe refers to the nuclear Watykins lightning that habitually strikes the eastern United States. This is also a reference to Watykins Harbor, one of the levels in Twisted Metal (2012).</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>31. Blankman</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172553-32.png\" /><br /><h3><p>The movie that John and Quiet watch in the movie theater is Blankman, a Wayans comedy starring Damon Wayans and David Alan Grier that opened in 1994.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>32. Hanson</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172554-33.png\" /><br /><h3><p>Quiet professes her fondness for mid-90s boy band Hanson, and she singles out Track 2 of their album Middle of Nowhere as being particularly catchy. Track 2 is \"MMMBop,\" which hit #1 on the Billboard charts in the United States.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>33. Watts</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172555-34.png\" /><br /><h3><p>Amanda Watts is the resident gearhead and de facto leader of the truck caravan in the series. In the game, Watts is a thrillseeker who's on a constant search for a faster ride. She drives the Twister car in Twisted Metal 2 (1996).</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>34. Twister</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172478-35.png\" /><br /><h3><p>We see the Twister car under a tarp, and Watts drives the car herself at the climax of the season finale. It is an IndyCar-styled race car with open wheels.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>35. Amber Rose</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172480-36.png\" /><br /><h3><p>John gets sent on an errand to see Amber Rose, who grows medicinal plants and poisons. In Twisted Metal III (1998), Amber Rose is an activist who enters the tournament to end it and stop its negative impact on the environment. She drives the Flower Power car.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>36. Flower Power</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172556-37.png\" /><br /><h3><p>We can see the Flower Power car in the background of this shot.

Granny Dread</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172557-38.png\" /><br /><h3><p>Granny is one of the founders and \"old timers\" of the truck caravan. She is the driver of monster truck Hammerhead in Twisted Metal III (1998).</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>38. Fellow Droogs</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172558-39.png\" /><br /><h3><p>The slow-motion sequence where Sweet Tooth and his followers take over one of Stone's outposts to the sound of classical music is inspired by a similar sequence in Stanley Kubrick's dystopian film A Clockwork Orange (1971)</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>39. Charlie Kane</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172559-40.png\" /><br /><h3><p>The flashback to Sweet Tooth's childhood reveals that his father was a taxi cab driver. This is a reference to Charlie Kane, who drove the taxi cab Yellow Jacket in Twisted Metal (1995). In Twisted Metal: Black, Charlie is retconned to be Sweet Tooth's father.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>40.

Bloody Mary</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172564-45.png\" /><br /><h3><p>And lastly we see Blood Mary, John Doe's former girlfriend.

If you substitute \"Weapons\" for \"Special,\" which is essentially the same thing, these are the same statistical measurements that nearly every game in the Twisted Metal franchise uses to rank its vehicles.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>49. Roadkill</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4172570-50.png\" /><br /><h3><p>The Roadkill vehicle, which Quiet and John build together, is John Doe's vehicle in Twisted Metal: Black (2001).

During publisher Electronic Arts' earnings briefing, the company announced that developer Respawn is now in the \"early stages\" of bringing the Star Wars game to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.</p><p>Jedi: Survivor launched at the end of April this year for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. The game enjoyed generally favorable reviews, but the PC version left something to be desired in terms of performance. EA released multiple patches to address the issues over time.</p><p>The announcement from Respawn and EA today about bringing Jedi: Survivor to older consoles probably came as a surprise to some. In February, game director Stig Asmussen told <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PLAYgamingmag/status/1622922699092766720\">Play Magazine</a> (<a href=\"https://gamerant.com/star-wars-jedi-survivor-ps4-xbox-one/\">via GameRant</a>) that Respawn was skipping PS4/Xbox One so the company could take full advantage of the superior processors and memory of the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S compared to the PS4 and Xbox One. Asmussen said Respawn was hoping to achieve a \"true new-gen experience\" with Jedi: Survivor.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-survivor-coming-ps4-and-xbox-one/1100-6516463/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-survivor-coming-ps4-and-xbox-one/1100-6516463/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-08-01T21:05:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "6 Greatest WWE Summerslam Moments Of The Modern Era", "description": "<p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15976769/4172469-fy9wphlwqaadonz.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Ah, Summerslam! WWE's second-biggest flagship show of the year has given fans memorable moments that rival even Wrestlemania's, and it's easy to see why. Summerslam is the event where Honky Tonk Man's legendary Intercontinental Championship reign came to an ultimate end, it's where TLC II gave us some of the wildest Jeff Hardy moments, provided mat classics that are still go-to matches decades later (looking at you Bret Hart and Mr. Perfect), and of course, the lavish wedding of Randy Savage and Miss Elizabeth.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">While it may feel like it's tough to compete with WWE's Attitude Era Summerslams or even earlier instances of the show in the Golden Era, the modern era has given it some of the most memorable moments in the company's history. It's where champions have been made and legacies formedThe fact that we're in the midst of some of the hottest angles going in wrestling today, makes this year's Summerslam a do-not-miss event that features matches that could easily end up as just as iconic years down the road.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">On August 5, the WWE will host the 35th Summerslam from Detroit, featuring a Wrestlemania rematch between Cody Rhodes and Brock Lesnar, WWE Undisputed Universal Champion Roman Reigns puts his title on the line against Jey Uso, and a Summerslam rematch from 2016 with Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins puts his World Heavyweight Championship against Finn Balor.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Looking back at the Summerslam events of the modern era, we've narrowed down the six biggest and best moments from the biggest party of the summer. Did we miss your favorite? Add it in the comments!</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. Jon Stewart Turns Heel To Help Seth Rollins</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15976769/4172463-john-stewart.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>This is the match that gave us Seth Rollins' iconic \"Rollins The White\" gear (that was followed by a barrage of Power Ranger memes), but it was also Rollins' biggest title defense at that time. Rollins had cashed in his Money in the Bank briefcase to win the WWE World Heavyweight Championship at Wrestlemania and now he was facing off against the poster child of WWE, and United States Champion, John Cena.</p><p>Throughout the night, former host of The Daily Show Jon Stewart had been shown attending and enjoying the show with his son. Stewart said that he's a huge fan and couldn't wait for Cena to beat Seth. The Daily Show host and the WWE Champion had been semi-feuding until this point, with Rollins even making an appearance on Stewart's show. Now though, with both titles on the line, Rollins wanted to solidify his reign as champ.</p><p>During the match, a ref went down and Stewart appeared in the ring. It looked like he was there to prevent Rollins from winning; instead, he rammed Cena with a steel chair. The Architect emerged from the match with his arm raised and two championships in his possession, making him the first co-holder of the WWE and United States Championships.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. Brock Lesnar Brings The Farm To Roman Reigns</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15976769/4172465-roman-reigns-summerslam-ring-tractor-july-31-a.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>2022's Summerslam featured one of the biggest Wrestlemania rematches of all time with Roman Reigns and Brock Lesnar adding another chapter to their already storied history. The pair had made previous Summerslam history back in 2018 when Roman ended Lesnar's historic 504-day reign as Universal Champion.</p><p>Now, Roman's Undisputed Universal Championship was on the line and the Tribal Chief had never been stronger, with a two-year reign already under his belt. Elaborate entrances are forever part of WWE, so when Lesnar came into the arena riding on his tractor, it received a huge pop from fans.</p><p>However, the mood went from uproarious to straight-up nuclear eruption when Lesnar used the tractor to lift the ring--while Roman was still inside of it. Lesnar came up short once more against Roman, but his tractor is now immortal in the WWE Universe.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. Becky Lynch Becomes The Man</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15976769/4172462-becky-lynch-charlotte-summerslam-2018.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Becky Lynch had always been the odd woman out in The Four Horsewomen group consisting of her, Charlotte Flair, Bayley, and Sasha Banks. She never captured the NXT Women's Championship and was seen at the bottom of their hierarchy, with Flair being crowned at the top.</p><p>Lynch eventually became the inaugural Smackdown Women's Championship, but still wasn't quite making an impact in the women's division. Those years of frustration finally hit their peak as Lynch turned on her friend Charlotte Flair, moments after The Queen captured the Smackdown Women's Championship from Carmella in a Triple Threat match, where it was Lynch that caught the pinfall.</p><p>The frustrated former 'Lass Kicker' beat Flair down, releasing all that energy and pent-up resentment towards Charlotte, and received a thunderous roar from the crowd that night. Lynch cemented herself as a force to be reckoned with, adorning herself with the moniker The Man, a nickname taken from Charlotte's father, Ric Flair. Becky would become the centerpiece of the women's division for the next two years, even main-eventing Wrestlemania and becoming the first Undisputed Women's Champion.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. Daniel Bryan Wins The Big One, Loses The Big One</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15976769/4172464-ecrvaw3wwaayrmk.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Daniel Bryan had become an indie sensation when he finally signed with WWE in 2009. He eventually won the World Heavyweight Championship and United States Championship, yet the WWE Championship still escaped him. But his time came at Summerslam 2013\u2026for a moment anyway.</p><p>John Cena was the champ at the time, as was the case for much of the 2010s, and Daniel Bryan was billed as the ultimate underdog. The story told was that the McMahons did not see Bryan as a big star and reminded him every chance they got. When it came down to Cena and Bryan, even then Bryan was told he didn't belong in the main event.</p><p>However, the B-plus Player, as they nicknamed him, outperformed the Franchise Player to capture the WWE Championship in a match that featured Triple H as referee. It was a short-lived victory, though, as Triple H hit Bryan with a Pedigree as then-Mr. Money in the Bank Randy Orton slid into the ring for the easy pin and another championship reign.</p><p>Orton was joined by the McMahons and the Authority was born. Instead of stopping Bryan's momentum, though, taking the title away from the beloved star sparked the birth of the \"Yes Movement\" among fans, which made Bryan a star and sent him on a trajectory to main event Wrestlemania 30.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. Suplex City Is Built On The Back Of John Cena</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15976769/4172461-cenalesnar.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>To say Brock Lesnar had an incredible 2014, maybe the best year of his career, could be an understatement. He ended the undefeated streak of The Undertaker at WrestleMania 30 and turned his raw strength and focus to the WWE World Heavyweight Champion John Cena at Summerslam.</p><p>It was one of the most brutal matches ever to be featured under the Summerslam name--and one of the shortest.</p><p>Lesnar practically destroyed Cena, taking him for a ride for 16 consecutive German suplexes. That was the night Lesnar's famed \"Suplex City\" catchphrase was born, and the first citizen was none other than the WWE Champion. There was no Super Cena here. No heroic comeback, no finding that inner strength to triumph and retain his title. No, Cena was beaten into submission and conquered as the Beast held the WWE title high once again.</p><p>Suplex after suplex after suplex after suplex AFTER suplex\u2026Lesnar would hold the title for another eight months before losing it to Seth Rollins at Wrestlemania 31 in an impromptu triple threat match involving Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins, who cashed in his Money in the Bank briefcase to pull off \"the heist of the century.\" In the months leading up to that, however, Lesnar carved his own legacy as a modern-day god taking on--and conquering--WWE's biggest stars and competitors. Still, it all started with taking out WWE's poster child in the most dominant way possible.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. Roman Reigns' Great Heel Turn</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15976769/4172468-ss_08232020jg_37825.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>2020 was a transition year for WWE, for sports\u2026and, well, really the world in general. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the real world had to adapt and keep people safe. Taking notes from the rest of professional sports, WWE constructed its Thunderdome stadium featuring fans who would show up on large LED screens instead of empty arenas as it had been doing.</p><p>For Summerslam that year, the main event was Braun Strowman against Bray Wyatt, who was still under his Fiend persona, for the Universal Championship. The subpar and weird match aside, which pitted former Wyatt Family members against one another, it was the surprise of the return of Roman Reigns that forever changed the WWE landscape.</p><p>Reigns had been gone for five months, returning to deliver a spear to the Fiend after the match. Roman then turned his sights to Strowman, hitting the Monster with multiple chair shots. Lastly, Reigns executed one final spear on The Fiend before hoisting up the Universal Championship.</p><p>On Smackdown, Roman could be seen talking to a hidden advisor, who was quickly revealed to be Paul Heyman. Their alliance took the WWE by storm as they molded the championship scene into their image as Reigns would soon challenge for the Universal Championship in a triple threat match and now has retained that title for more than 1,000 days.</p></h3></p><br />", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/6-greatest-wwe-summerslam-moments-of-the-modern-era/2900-4825/", "date_published": "2023-08-01T20:31:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Fort Solis Is A Slow-Burn Horror Story In A Classic Sci-Fi Setting", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">It doesn't seem to matter how many times I've seen it; an abandoned, often eerily sterile space station set as the backdrop to a mystery always pulls me in with ease. <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/fort-solis/\">Fort Solis</a>, a sci-fi horror adventure game featuring an impressive voice cast, is the latest in a long lineage of stories set in such environments, and after playing the game's first chapter, I'm eager to unravel the mystery set on its titular martian base.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Despite being billed as an indie game from studio Fallen Leaf, Fort Solis feels much bigger.

Exoprimal takes the opposite approach, only sharing a slice of what it has to offer for the first few hours of gameplay, risking people bouncing off due to a lack of content. It holds back its best moments and more interesting missions for anyone willing to put in the work. Intense and exciting surprises await those who put in the time to reach them--something that it's well worth doing.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Exoprimal is a 5v5 shooter, except that the majority of your time will be spent shooting hordes of AI-controlled dinosaurs and not the enemy team. Players race to complete a series of objectives, culminating in a final one that sometimes has PvP elements. Most missions follow this structure, with a few special missions taking place later in the story that deviate from this formula.</p><div>          </div><p dir=\"ltr\">The gameplay itself is primarily about fighting off hordes of dinosaurs, utilizing your suits specific loadout. The different Exosuits can drastically change the feel of combat, with damage focused suits utilizing a regular machine gun, grenade launcher, or melee weapons. The tank and healer classes each have their own weapons and feel, but with the addition of either a shield ability or healing ability. But the difference between Exosuits, like the counter-focused tank Murasame and the machine gun wielding Krieger tank, is more than enough to make each suit feel fresh in combat. All this brings a nice variety to gameplay, with the shooting itself feeling solid and the different enemies and weak points rewarding accurate shooting.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/exoprimal-review-prehistoric-warfare/1900-6418097/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/exoprimal-review-prehistoric-warfare/1900-6418097/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-08-01T16:49:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope DLC 3 Reveal Trailer", "description": "<img height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1352/13527689/4172307-rayman_sparksofhope.jpg\" width=\"480\" /> Rayman is back!

However, Larian Studios confirms that there's a whole other path that you could take--one that embraces the mind flayer inside instead of rejecting it. It's a hidden skill tree outside of the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-illithid-powers-illithid-wisdom-guide/1100-6515892/\">typical Illithian Powers</a>.</p><div>          </div><p>On <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/3655285307835439472\">Steam</a>, Larian goes into detail about how the hidden skill tree works. You already have one parasite inside you, but you need to consume even more to strengthen your Illithid Powers. These critters can be found throughout the Forgotten Realms inside of jars, pools of brine, and skulls of other mind flayer-infected folk. Each parasite can unlock a new node in the hidden skill tree.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-explains-mind-flayer-hidden-skill-tree-in-baldurs-gate-3/1100-6516428/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-explains-mind-flayer-hidden-skill-tree-in-baldurs-gate-3/1100-6516428/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-08-01T13:03:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "One Of The Best Games In Years Just Came To Game Pass", "description": "<p>The calendar has rolled over to August, and with that, another high-profile game has been added to the Xbox Game Pass library.
