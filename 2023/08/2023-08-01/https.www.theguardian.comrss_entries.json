Three amplified instruments \u2013 electric bass, electric guitar and synthesiser \u2013 represent the ways in which the sun\u2019s power reaches Earth, from radio waves to cosmic particles. Sounding suitably massive, these stimulate responses in the earthly, unamplified instruments of the rest of the orchestra: one tune for flutes and unison strings sounds like birdsong. Skye draws on a plethora of musical traditions \u2013 west African, Persian classical, Balinese. A solo cello plays a simple melody whose notes are tuned according to an unfamiliar, non-western scale; cellos and basses make drums out of the bodies of their instruments. It\u2019s rhythmically powerful stuff, at times an invitation to dance.

That\u2019s not the only surprise; the judges have chosen to spotlight some little-known debuts in the place of major novels. While it feels reductive to read the longlist in terms of what\u2019s not included, many will have expected to see Zadie Smith\u2019s September novel The Fraud, and Tom Crewe\u2019s acclaimed debut The New Life, among others.</p><p>The presence of four Irish writers, meanwhile, is far from surprising (and that\u2019s without the inclusion of Anne Enright\u2019s fine forthcoming novel The Wren, The Wren, or Claire Kilroy\u2019s scorching tale of new motherhood, Soldier Sailor). Sebastian Barry is a veteran author who pushes himself with each new book, and Old God\u2019s Time is a devastating, dreamlike study of the lifetime repercussions of historic childhood abuse in Catholic institutions. Paul Murray, loved for 2010\u2019s tragicomic Skippy Dies, writes the novel of his career with The Bee Sting, which uncovers a family\u2019s slow-burning secrets against a backdrop of climate anxiety \u2013 in terms of pure page-turning pleasure, this is probably the most enjoyable novel on the list. Elaine Feeney\u2019s How to Build a Boat explores the meaning of community and outsiderdom through one boy\u2019s story, while Paul Lynch\u2019s Prophet Song, scheduled for September, is a chilling study of Ireland becoming a fascist state.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/01/booker-prize-2023-irish-debuts-groundbreaking-sci-fi\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/01/booker-prize-2023-irish-debuts-groundbreaking-sci-fi", "date_published": "2023-08-01T08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "\u2018No timeframe\u2019 on delayed opening of Bibby Stockholm asylum barge", "description": "<p>Transport minister says barge in Portland going through \u2018final checks\u2019 amid row over safety concerns</p><p>A UK government minister has said he \u201ccannot put a timeframe\u201d on when the Home Office will open a controversial giant barge meant to house asylum seekers, which has been further delayed for checks.</p><p>The initial plan had been move people on to the Bibby Stockholm in Portland, Dorset, from this week, with numbers due to rise gradually over the coming months to the point where the vessel would eventually holds about 500 men.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/01/no-timeframe-on-delayed-opening-of-bibby-stockholm-asylum-barge\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/01/no-timeframe-on-delayed-opening-of-bibby-stockholm-asylum-barge", "date_published": "2023-08-01T07:36:39+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Mystery object found washed up on remote Australian beach identified as space debris", "description": "<p>The huge cylinder, which was found near Green Head, north of Perth, Western Australia, is most likely from an Indian rocket, space agency says</p><ul><li>Get our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/29/email-newsletters-guardian-australia-best-daily-news-emails-newsletter-free-sign-up-inbox-subscribe-headlines?CMP=cvau_sfl\">morning and afternoon news emails</a>, <a href=\"https://app.adjust.com/w4u7jx3\">free app</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/full-story?CMP=cvau_sfl\">daily news podcast</a></li></ul><p>A large chunk of space debris that washed up on a remote West Australian beach is mostly likely from an Indian launch vehicle, the Australian Space Agency says.</p><p>The cylinder, about 2.5m high and partly made of a gold-coloured woven material, was found earlier in July near Green Head, about 250km north of Perth.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/29/email-newsletters-guardian-australia-best-daily-news-emails-newsletter-free-sign-up-inbox-subscribe-headlines?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/29/email-newsletters-guardian-australia-best-daily-news-emails-newsletter-free-sign-up-inbox-subscribe-headlines?CMP=copyembed\"> </a><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/29/email-newsletters-guardian-australia-best-daily-news-emails-newsletter-free-sign-up-inbox-subscribe-headlines?CMP=copyembed\">email newsletters for your daily news roundup</a></strong></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/aug/01/mystery-object-australian-beach-identified-indian-rocket-space-debris-western-australia-green-head\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/aug/01/mystery-object-australian-beach-identified-indian-rocket-space-debris-western-australia-green-head", "date_published": "2023-08-01T07:13:47+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Hold your nerve on Lords reform, Keir Starmer, or we\u2019ll never see the back of Boris Johnson\u2019s cronies | Frances Ryan", "description": "<p>If Labour\u2019s leader only targets hereditary peers, the likes of Charlotte Owen and others who shouldn\u2019t even be there will survive</p><p>Bad news for fans of unelected legislatures: Labour is considering abolishing hereditary peers.

The daughter, Dandy, has told her social media followers that she wished she had the means to have the president assassinated; her mother, Anita, who scrutinises Dandy\u2019s habits of eating, speech, and dress obsessively while failing to conceal the fact that she is doing so, is desperate to impress on her daughter that \u201cher dual burdens, being Black and female, meant she had to be more careful and intelligent than any other sort of person\u201d; while Anita\u2019s husband, Horace, tries to be more droll and serene in his panic as he doles out \u201csweeping fatherly wisdom\u201d. \u201cBefore Dandy could protest, the rice cooker beeped out a tinny version of Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.

The holy pause occasioned by this appliance\u2019s tinny tune captures something precise and intimate about what a family can share even in the midst of the complex generational disputes that are one of Brinkley\u2019s recurrent preoccupations. The space hollowed out by the beeping nursery rhyme, around which the three characters fall silent for a spell, becomes a version, a tiny exemplification, of what Brinkley\u2019s stories manage to achieve. Like all the finest exponents of the short form, from Isaac Babel to Alice Munro, the scope and scale of the works collected in <em>Witness </em>is a central feature of their achievement: each is a brief and localised gathering akin to the trio suspended around the rice cooker, an experiment in the lives that can be held together \u2013 both the characters\u2019 and the reader\u2019s \u2013 by the tune of Brinkley\u2019s words.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/01/witness-by-jamel-brinkley-a-master-of-intimate-interactions\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/01/witness-by-jamel-brinkley-a-master-of-intimate-interactions", "date_published": "2023-08-01T06:00:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Indian sanitation workers clean up with \u00a31.2m lottery win", "description": "<p>An impulsive decision to collectively buy a single lottery ticket resulted in the friends from Kerala collectively hitting the jackpot</p><p>The 11 women had never felt luck was on their side.
