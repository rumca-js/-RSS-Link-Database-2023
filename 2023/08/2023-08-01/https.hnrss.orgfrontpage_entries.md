## Show HN: Magic Loops – Combine LLMs and code to create simple automations
 - [https://magicloops.dev](https://magicloops.dev)
 - RSS feed: https://hnrss.org/frontpage
 - date published: 2023-08-01T16:57:08+00:00

<p>Howdy! We built this as an experiment in personal-programming, combining the best of LLMs and code to help automate tasks around you. I personally use it to track the tides and get notified when certain conditions are met, something that pure LLMs had trouble dealing with and pure code was often too brittle for.<p>We created it after getting frustrated with the inability of LLMs to deal with numbers and the various hoops we had to jump through to make ChatGPT output repeatable.<p>At the core, Magic Loops are just a series of "blocks" (JSON) that can be triggered with different inputs (email, time, webhook), then operate on those inputs using a combination of LLMs and code, and then output those results (email, text, webhook). Under the hood, the LLM calls are using GPT-4 via OpenAI and the code is run in sandboxed (no internet) Docker containers in AWS.<p>You have full control over each step of the loop, but you can also create (or attempt to create) a Magic Loop by simply describing what you want. We use GPT-4 to break that request into feasible steps, and then create a Magic Loop scaffold. Of course, you should still validate the loop before publishing it!<p>We've seen some neat use cases already:<p>- "Text me when the tide is less than 1ft between 7am and 7pm at Fort Funston"<p>- "Summarize an email using this format and forward it to this address"<p>- "Text me every time our store does more than $1000/day in volume on Shopify"<p>- "Take specific data from Cloudflare, format it, and send it to Mixpanel every hour"<p>We hope you enjoy what's essentially an experiment at this point. If folks like the concept, we're thinking about open sourcing it so you can run the loops locally with the code runtimes you wish (rather than in our code runners).<p>Let us know what you think, and more importantly, what you wish to build or automate!<p>Cheers,
Adam & Mihai</p>

<p>For example:<p>I've used 3+ code editors on MacOS and prefer sublime text over VScode, coteditor, xcode.<p>I've used Chrome, Firefox and Safari all within the past year, and I prefer Chrome and Safari.<p>I've used 3+ voice transcription apps, the ones I prefer are 'just press record' and Otter.ai, I can't remember the names of the others I used - but I downloaded a bunch of Whisper based ones and non-whisper based ones on the iOS app store.<p>I've used 3+ messaging apps, I like iMessage and Telegram, I prefer those over Signal and WhatsApp.<p>I've used 3+ interfaces for GPT, and I prefer the OpenAI playground over ChatGPT, chatbot-ui, typingmind, openplayground, Poe, and a few others I can't remember.<p>I think it's important to note that for me these are all preferences. I'm not saying one of these tools are objectively better. I am saying that for me they are better, and I prefer them.<p>What are areas of products, tools, developer tools, APIs, anything, where you've personally used 3+ tools, and what did you prefer, and what did you not prefer, if you can still remember?</p>

## Show HN: PromptTools – open-source tools for evaluating LLMs and vector DBs
 - [https://github.com/hegelai/prompttools](https://github.com/hegelai/prompttools)
 - RSS feed: https://hnrss.org/frontpage
 - date published: 2023-08-01T16:23:15+00:00

<p>Hey HN! We’re Kevin and Steve. We’re building PromptTools (<a href="https://github.com/hegelai/prompttools">https://github.com/hegelai/prompttools</a>): open-source, self-hostable tools for experimenting with, testing, and evaluating LLMs, vector databases, and prompts.<p>Evaluating prompts, LLMs, and vector databases is a painful, time-consuming but necessary part of the product engineering process. Our tools allow engineers to do this in a lot less time.<p>By “evaluating” we mean checking the quality of a model's response for a given use case, which is a combination of testing and benchmarking. As examples:
- For generated JSON, SQL, or Python, you can check that the output is actually JSON, SQL, or executable Python. 
- For generated emails, you can use another model to assess the quality of the generated email given some requirements, like whether or not the email is written professionally. 
- For a question-answering chatbot, you can check that the actual answer is semantically similar to an expected answer.<p>At Google, Steve worked with HuggingFace and Lightning to support running the newest open-source models on TPUs. He realized that while the open-source community was contributing incredibly powerful models, it wasn’t so easy to discover and evaluate them. It wasn’t clear when you could use Llama or Falcon instead of GPT-4. We began looking for ways to simplify and scale this evaluation process.<p>With PromptTools, you can write a short Python script (as short as 5 lines) to run such checks across models, parameters, and prompts, and pass the results into an evaluation function to get scores. All these can be executed on your local machine without sending data to third-parties. Then we help you turn those experiments into unit tests and CI/CD that track your model’s performance over time.<p>Today we support all of the major model providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, HuggingFace, and even LlamaCpp, and vector databases like ChromaDB and Weaviate. You can evaluate responses via semantic similarity, auto-evaluation by a language model, or structured output validations like JSON and Python. We even have a notebook UI for recording manual feedback.<p>Quickstart:<p><pre><code>  pip install prompttools
  git clone https://github.com/hegelai/prompttools.git
  cd prompttools && jupyter notebook examples/notebooks/OpenAIChatExperiment.ipynb
</code></pre>
For detailed instructions, see our documentation at <a href="https://prompttools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://prompttools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</a>.<p>We also have a playground UI, built in streamlit, which is currently in beta: <a href="https://github.com/hegelai/prompttools/tree/main/prompttools/playground">https://github.com/hegelai/prompttools/tree/main/prompttools...</a>. Launch it with:<p><pre><code>  pip install prompttools
  git clone https://github.com/hegelai/prompttools.git
  cd prompttools && streamlit run prompttools/ui/playground.py
</code></pre>
We’d love it if you tried our product out and let us know what you think! We just got started a month ago and we’re eager to get feedback and keep building.</p>

## Ask HN: Did anyone write a book in Nano?

<p>I discovered that some people deliberately choose to write stories in terminal-based text-editors like Nano or Vim, because it forces you to spend more time on honing the story instead of being distracted by formatting and other fancy features. I'm attracted to this idea, in the same way that the dwm window manager forces me to focus my attention.<p>I was curious to know if anyone here actually did that, and what their experience was. Did it make you more productive? Was the editing process a mess? Any anecdotes?</p>

## Launch HN: Tiptap (YC S23) – Toolkit for developing collaborative editors
 - [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36957204](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36957204)

<p>Hi HN! We're Nick, Patrick, Philip, Sebastian, Sven, and Timo from Titap (<a href="https://tiptap.dev/">https://tiptap.dev/</a>), an open source developer toolkit for building collaborative editing apps. Our editor framework, based on ProseMirror, is at <a href="https://github.com/ueberdosis/tiptap">https://github.com/ueberdosis/tiptap</a>, and our real-time collaboration backend, based on Yjs, is at <a href="https://github.com/ueberdosis/hocuspocus">https://github.com/ueberdosis/hocuspocus</a>.<p>Building editor interfaces like Notion or Google Docs in your web app takes a lot of work and time. Our open source tools and cloud services let you build collaborative content editing faster—in days or weeks, rather than months or years. And this is just for the editor. If you want real-time collaboration or other advanced features like version history in your editor, the overall workload quickly escalates—you will need a robust and serious backend infrastructure that requires even more time to set up and maintain. This doesn’t make sense for most frontend developers or most startups.<p>We spent eight years as a digital agency developing applications with complex content editing functionality. We learned the hard way how limited the existing editors were. After building Tiptap as a headless editor framework with an extension-based architecture, we needed to allow multiple users to edit content simultaneously, which got complicated. There was no simple solution that could be integrated quickly. So we built that too.<p>The Tiptap editor is based on the JS framework ProseMirror, which is a good foundation for editors. The learning curve for ProseMirror is steep because it's complicated to understand and lacks simple APIs and documentation. It takes a lot of code around ProseMirror to develop a modern user experience. We’ve taken care of that for you.<p>Tiptap is headless, so it will work with whatever frontend or design you have in mind—we make no assumptions about your UI. You can use it to develop block-based editors like Notion, classic interfaces like Google Docs, or whatever you need. It's also framework agnostic, so you can use it with React, Vue, etc., or vanilla JavaScript. And it's highly customizable through our extension architecture. We also provide an API to access ProseMirror's internals through Tiptap if you want to dig deep into the core.<p>Adding real-time collaboration to your editor is as easy as installing and configuring an extension. Our collaboration backend, called Hocuspocus, uses Yjs. This is a widely used implementation of CRDTs (conflict- free replicated data type). Hocuspocus makes it easy to set up a Node.js websocket server to handle communication between multiple peers to synchronize data. Like the Tiptap editor, Hocuspocus is designed to be extensible according to your needs. Also, Hocuspocus can work independently of Tiptap with other editors like Lexical or Slate.<p>An earlier version of Tiptap got discussed a couple years ago at <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26901975">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26901975</a>. We’ve been enjoying wider adoption since then. For example, Substack uses Tiptap for their editor that allows creators to write content on substack.com, and YC uses Tiptap in their Bookface forum (which is basically HN for YC alums).<p>With the Tiptap Cloud, we offer managed backend services if you don't want to build and maintain every feature yourself. For real-time collaboration, we provide a cloud infrastructure with multiple datacenter regions where you can deploy Hocuspocus. The Tiptap AI integration beta is a service where you connect your OpenAI API key to our backend and install the Tiptap editor AI extension to get AI writing experience in your editor. Here’s a demo: <a href="https://ai-demo.tiptap.dev/">https://ai-demo.tiptap.dev/</a><p>We invite you to explore Tiptap's capabilities in your app, contribute to its open source development, and (hopefully!) join our welcoming community. We'd love to hear what you've already built with Tiptap or what's stopping you from creating something with it :-) We look forward to all of your comments!</p>
