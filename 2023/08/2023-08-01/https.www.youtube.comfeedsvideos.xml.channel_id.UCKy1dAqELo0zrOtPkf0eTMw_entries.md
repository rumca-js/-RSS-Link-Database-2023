## How the FTC Screwed Up the Xbox/Activision Case

Now that the FTC vs. Microsoft battle over the Microsoft/Activision deal is over, we'll take a deep dive into how the FTC screwed up the Xbox/FTC trial. 

We're sure everyone knows that the Xbox/FTC verdict turned out to be a win for the Activision/Blizzard deal, but this video will dive into the particulars of Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley's opinion. Everything is going to be discussed, from the true competitors of the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, to Xbox Game Pass, to xCloud, to the flawed logic of the FTC, which resulted in them inadvertently proving Xbox could lose money by making Call of duty exclusive.

We'll also talk about the effects from the FTC vs Microsoft/Activision case as they relate to Xbox, obviously, but also PlayStation and the PS5.

For all things, Xbox news, be sure to keep it locked to IGN.

Battle Shapers is the first game from Metric Empire, and it’s best described like this: “what if you crossed the gameplay of Doom Eternal with the boss-stealing powers and general vibe of Mega Man and added a little bit of Roguelite structure for flavoring?” Mix in an absolutely gorgeous art style reminiscent of Overwatch in the best possible way and Battle Shapers is a unique, fast-paced FPS that might have you saying “just one more run” way, way past the time you should be going to bed.
