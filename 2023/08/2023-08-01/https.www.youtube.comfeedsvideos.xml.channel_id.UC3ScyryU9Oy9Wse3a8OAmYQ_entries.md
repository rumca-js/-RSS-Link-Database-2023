In the 2011 documentary “Flying Cheaper,” FRONTLINE examined the outsourcing of major airline repair work to U.S.-based contractors who kept costs low by using unlicensed mechanics and to foreign-based maintenance operations, from China to El Salvador. FRONTLINE correspondent Miles O’Brien investigated reports of undertrained mechanics, foreign workers who couldn’t read English language repair manuals, inadequate FAA oversight and the use of unauthorized airline parts.

“Flying Cheaper” was a co-production with the Investigative Reporting Workshop that was produced by Rick Young and Catherine Rentz. Miles O’Brien was the correspondent. Rick Young was the writer. Leslie Atkins was the editor. Raney Aronson-Rath was series senior producer. David Fanning was executive producer.
