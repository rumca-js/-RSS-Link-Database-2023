<p>Derby and Bolton are well equipped to challenge for automatic promotion but Port Vale and Cambridge could find it tough</p><p>This time last year <strong>Derby County</strong> were hurriedly trying to put pieces together after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/01/derby-out-of-administration-as-david-clowes-seals-exciting-takeover">a much-needed takeover</a> and, although relief ultimately turned to disappointment after missing out on the playoffs on the final day, a tilt at the title looks a distinct possibility. Sonny Bradley, club captain at Luton last season, Curtis Nelson and Callum Elder are fine acquisitions in defence and Paul Warne’s side should be hard to beat. <strong>Portsmouth</strong> had the makings of a fine team but also fell short last season so after a busy summer – with 11 new faces, including Regan Poole from Lincoln – they look well-placed to challenge.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/01/league-one-2023-24-preview-the-contenders-hopefuls-and-strugglers">Continue reading...</a>

Actor whose television character Pee-wee Herman delighted children and their parents in the 1980s<p>One of the most subversive and original figures in 1980s popular culture was a whey-faced, cherry-lipped, matchstick-thin child-man who wore a red bow tie, white tasselled loafers and a shrunken grey suit, and lived in a giant playhouse with sentient furniture and a floating head. This was Pee-wee Herman, created and played by the actor Paul Reubens, who has died aged 70 of cancer.</p><p>The character appeared on stage in The Pee-wee Herman Show during the early 1980s but did not become known internationally until the release of the film Pee-wee’s Big Adventure (1985), which marked the doolally debut of the director Tim Burton. US cinema in the Reagan era drew heavily on the iconography of the 50s and early 60s, whether for purposes sweet (Back to the Future, Peggy Sue Got Married) or unsavoury (Blue Velvet, Parents); this big-screen outing for Pee-wee, who was already suffused with the spirit of bygone children’s shows such as Howdy Doody and Captain Kangaroo, fell somewhere in between. As with the stage and TV incarnations, the film’s undercurrent of kinkiness and innuendo never contaminated its air of gleeful innocence.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/01/paul-reubens-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Olympic sprint champion died during childbirth earlier this year. But she was far from an anomaly in a troubled US health system</p><p>The last time Tianna Madison saw Tori Bowie alive was at a meet in Gainesville, Florida. This was in April 2021 – back when the rival sprinters were on separate quests to regain the form that powered them to gold in the 4x100m at the 2016 Olympics. Bowie was one of track and field’s most striking personalities, a speed demon as well as a style icon, the elite runner whose go-to accessory was a colorful hair scarf. Madison always looked forward to sharing the spotlight with her. There were hugs, pleasantries and no hard feelings when Madison beat Bowie in the 100m – the pair finished second and ninth, respectively</p><p>“At a meet, I always want to circle back and catch up with people,” Madison says. “But it’s also <em>work</em>; you race, you’re sweaty, exhausted, hungry …”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/01/tori-bowie-death-childbirth-black-mothers-pregnancy-us">Continue reading...</a>

<p>D Smith’s effortless documentary, eloquently explained by its glamorous subjects, covers the whole spectrum of experience</p><p>Shot in a curiously warm monochrome that accentuates the statuesque glamour of its interviewees, the documentary builds a collective portrait of several Black trans women who have all at one point been sex workers. Directed, shot and edited by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/19/trans-film-maker-d-smith">D Smith</a>, a transgender woman who used to be a producer in the music industry, and made on a G-string budget, the film covers a lot of ground in a relaxed, effortless way. It kicks off with a horrifying and then surprisingly funny true story told by Liyah Mitchell about how she encountered a client with a gun on him – and attacked him, fearing she was about to be shot. Long story short, the gun was only for his self-protection and they ended up having sex anyway.</p><p>But not all the anecdotes are so amusing and blithe. There is plenty of discussion of the dark side of sex work, from the way it can numb workers emotionally to tales of friends who contracted HIV and later died of Aids, or were killed by violent clients. Truly, this covers the whole spectrum of experience, all of it eloquently explained by the subjects, an assortment of women who tell their truths about clients who can’t be honest with themselves, their complicated relationships with friends, family and cis women, the legacy of slave culture, and their favourite portable electric shavers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/01/kokomo-city-review-black-trans-women-tell-their-truths-d-smith">Continue reading...</a>
