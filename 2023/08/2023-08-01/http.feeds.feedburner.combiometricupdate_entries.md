		Rwanda has launched a call to tender for the digitization of the country’s civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) archiving system under the Rwanda Digital Acceleration Project.

The Rwanda Information Association Authority (RISA), which made the announcement via a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rwanda-digital-acceleration-project_tender-for-digitization-of-civil-registry-activity-7087699345071849472-Tcuh/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">LinkedIn post</a>, says bidding for the contract will be done exclusively via a dedicated digital procurement system.

The bidding deadline is September 13, 2023.

The contract will be funded partly by a pair of $100 million loans from the World Bank’s International Development Association and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), and the funder requests that bidding for the contract be done in compliance with its anti-corruption prescriptions.

The bid announcement is part of a 147-page document explaining administrative and technical details related to how the bidding process should be done.

RISA says the contract will be awarded to the bidder with the “most advantageous bid” not only in terms of meeting qualification criteria, but also in terms of “the lowest evaluated costs.”

Rwanda launched a digital birth registry in 2020, and the country <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202209/nigeria-rwanda-progress-in-national-childbirth-registration-programs">aimed for 100 percent birth registration</a> by the end of last year.

According to the tender issuer, the project seeks to ensure that all civil registry documentation from when the country gained independence in 1962, to 2020, are scanned to produce images which will be indexed and meta data entry in the CRVS system.

“The digitized records will be accessed in the CRVS database and will be used for the searching of specific records in the civil registries for enrollment in the single digital. The project is expected to rid the sector offices of bulky, dusty and at times stinky books,” a section of the bid document reads. There are an estimated 40,000 to 45,000 such books, stored at 418 sites, and holding between 10 and 12 million records.

Once digitized, the system will, among other things, provide a fast, more accurate and comprehensive data search and results to stakeholders by scanning the civil registry archives and record books, and indexing and data integration to the CRVS system.

The Rwanda Digital Acceleration Project is a digital transformation project designed to increase access to broadband and selected digital public services and strengthen the country’s digital innovation ecosystem.

It comprises four components which include digital access and inclusion, digital public service delivery, digital innovation and entrepreneurship, and the project management component which has to do with financing the project management costs.

The World Bank is committing $200 million to the project.

		Pledges by the UK government that its use of biometric data in law enforcement would be limited to, for example, the most serious crimes, are beginning to sound hollow.

The Times is <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/shoplifters-face-prison-under-crime-crackdown-ggdbv3j99">reporting</a> that police minister Chris Philp wants live facial recognition used in prosecuting shoplifters. He <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/facewatch-caught-in-more-controversy-after-closed-door-meeting-with-uk-home-office">met with Facewatch</a> Founder Simon Gordon and Home Office officials recently to discuss the technology’s potential benefits. Photos of known shoplifters should be compared to the police's national biometric database of criminals.

Quoting national crime statistics, The Times says 339,000 cases of shoplifting were recorded during the 12 months ending with February. Only 14 percent of those cases ended with charges being filed. Fifty-four percent were closed with no subject being identified.

The British Retail Consortium, however, says the problem is far worse.

Eight million instances of shoplifting in the United Kingdom happened in the 12 months ending with February. Losses total about £1 billion, or US$1.3 billion.

Only London's Metropolitan and <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202205/south-wales-police-claim-success-with-facial-recognition-app-trial">South Wales police</a> use live facial recognition software. Both departments <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/uk-mps-examine-met-police-use-of-facial-recognition">use</a> <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/nec">NEC</a>'s Neoface V4.1 for biometrics matching.

Shoplifting is gaining attention in a way that would go hand in hand with facial recognition.

Richard Holden, a transport minister, feels that more shoplifters should go to jail even if it means building more prisons, according to The Times piece.

## Facial recognition used to streamline roll call in Brazil schools

		The school roll call as most know it is being transformed by face biometrics. In Paraná, Brazil, over 200,000 students were processed daily during the pilot phase of a new facial recognition-based attendance system developed by <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/valid">Valid</a> and <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/innovatrics">Innovatrics</a>. It has cut down roll call time by as much as 80 percent, according to a <a href="https://www.innovatrics.com/resources/lightweight-facial-recognition-automates-roll-calls-at-schools/">case study</a>.

Innovatrics' compact neural network for direct face detection on devices authenticates identity by processing kilobytes of data instead of transmitting an entire video stream that could be several megabytes. Teachers can now use a mobile app on their phone developed by the government and take one to four pictures of an entire class.

The detection software extracts each students' face from the photos. Average face detection takes one millisecond and face extraction averages 100 milliseconds<strong>.</strong> Faces are compared to photos in a watchlist. The software marks identified students present or absent. Names left unticked are manually checked by teacher. Parents also have the app.

The program eliminates the need for traditional physical hardware, which can have access-control benefits. It also reportedly has zero hardware maintenance costs, while the traditional system used 17,000 servers worth over $500,000. The system has the potential to be implemented in more than 2,100 schools, affecting almost one million students.

Other countries where biometrics have been used for school attendance-taking include <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202001/indian-states-deploy-facial-recognition-for-election-polls-biometric-attendance-system-in-schools">India</a> and <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202301/kuwait-picks-contractor-for-biometric-attendance-system-in-public-schools">Kuwait</a>.

## BioID liveness detection to be used in Bavarian social robot study

		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/bioid">BioID</a>'s biometric liveness detection technology will be used to enhance the social capabilities of "humanoid" social robots for a study led by the FORSocialRobots research network. The network will analyze six applications of the technology in relevant social fields — monitoring, logistics, production, service, retirement homes, and dementia centers.

The goal of the study is to extract and structure social skills and transfer them to different robots operating in different scenarios.

Liveness detection will be used to enable systems to recognize if a real person or a recaptured representation of a person is in front of them. BioID's API distinguishes images or motion mimicked by photos and videos from real faces. It can block masks, avatars, deepfakes, and other spoofing attempts by analyzing two selfies taken by any standard camera. This will help ensure that the robot only assists actual people.

To achieve this, researchers will extract the necessary social skills between humans and machines, structure them as machine-readable, and then use AI tools to represent them. They will then research the social skills for situational and empathetic communication as well as adaptive and proactive interaction before making them available in the form of "microservices," so that they can be used in a technical system.

The skills will then be simulated in a virtual environment to check functionality and evaluate them safely with "test persons."

The study is scheduled to begin on January 1, 2024 and will run for three years. The network is funded by a grant of roughly 1,980,000 euros (roughly US$2,173,525) from the <a href="https://www.forschungsstiftung.de/">Bavarian Research Foundation</a>.

FORSocialRobots is competing with another research group funded by the foundation, FORNeRo, which focuses on the ergonomic integration of robotics in clinical workflow settings. Together, these two groups and seven other technology projects will receive a combined 8.5 million euros (roughly US$9,329,898).

“Turning innovative research approaches into concrete applications for entrepreneurial and social practice is entirely in line with our high-tech agenda of the Bavarian state government," says Minister of Economics Hubert Aiwanger, the recently appointed deputy chairman of the foundation council, in a release.

		U.S. and Egyptian officials are pushing for AML and KYC regulation to combat fraud and other illicit financial flows, though the American measures have yet to be approved.
<h2>Egypt requires digital ID for fintech, non-bank finance</h2>
The Financial Regulatory Authority of Egypt issued several decrees regulating the development and use of fintech within non-banking financial services and activities.

Decree 139 of 2023 outlines requirements for the digital infrastructure of non-banking financial institutions and further establishes governance, risk management and cybersecurity frameworks. It also requires that non-banking institutions enter a service level agreement with its customers and establish a 24/7 customer service center.

Decree 140 requires non-banking financial service firms to have a license certifying that they have processes established to verify digital IDs and keep records of their use. The digital identity process outlines multi-factor authentication requirements based on risks, and including biometrics.

Decree 141 establishes a registry for companies using fintech for outsourcing services. Registered entities must ensure data security and customer privacy. They must also get liability insurance. A registration fee of 25,000 Egyptian pounds (US$809) "for each sector of activity" according to an analysis <a href="https://www.clydeco.com/en/insights/2023/07/egypt-financial-regulatory-authority">article</a> from international law firm Clyde &amp; Co. The registration is valid for one year.
<h2>Bipartisan digital asset AML act to extend rules combatting crypto fraud</h2>
In the U.S., Sens. Roger Marshall, Elizabeth Warren, Lindsey Graham and Joe Manchin reintroduced the bipartisan Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act for consideration. It is designed to mitigate risks to national security by closing loopholes that can be used to finance of terrorism, drug trafficking and other criminal activities, according to a release.

If passed, the act would extend responsibilities of the Bank Secrecy Act, including KYC requirements, to digital wallet providers, validators, and other participants that facilitate digital transactions.

The act would also require banks to verify customer identities for unhosted wallets that would otherwise bypass <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/aml-fines-rise-in-uk-fraud-risks-widen-digital-id-efforts-expand">AML checks</a>. Anyone engaging in a transaction greater than $10,000 through one or more offshore accounts would need to file a report with the Internal Revenue Service.

The bill has been endorsed by the Major County Sheriffs of America, AARP and Global Financial Integrity, among others.

<img alt="smart camera edge device retail" class="attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="667" src="https://d1sr9z1pdl3mb7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/03144630/smart-camera-edge-device-retail.jpg" width="1000" />
		Amid a worrying rise in retail crime, retailers are adopting facial biometrics as a preventive measure. A case study from RecFaces shows that such systems can identify thieves and reduce theft-related losses by 50 percent. As law enforcement often struggles to respond to theft incidents promptly, these systems fill a crucial gap, identifying thieves and alerting security personnel in real-time while adhering to regulatory requirements to ensure data privacy, RecFaces says.

In their <a href="https://nrf.com/research/national-retail-security-survey-2021">2021 retail survey report</a>, the National Retail Federation (NRF) provides some alarming statistics. According to the report, 64 percent of respondents observed a surge in losses from organized criminal groups since 2016, while 53 percent reported an escalation/increase in theft. Furthermore, 82 percent of the survey participants reported an increase in the severity of attacks and the use of weapons.

The often-delayed response of the police to shoplifting incidents leaves retail businesses vulnerable to theft. Store employees, wary of potentially armed perpetrators, avoid personally confronting suspects, while law enforcement personnel respond to incidents only after the criminals have escaped. Additionally, theft cases below a specific monetary value are often deemed low-priority and go uninvestigated.

Retailers have taken several measures to address the increasing incidence of crime in their industry. These tactics include embracing security measures like anti-theft systems, on-site monitoring, and facial recognition technologies.

Facial recognition systems have been highly effective in preventing theft and robberies. For example, a major <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202304/uk-civil-society-considers-which-ai-controversies-we-need-goes-back-to-the-lfr-well">retail store chain</a> reports that its facial recognition system prevents thousands of crimes each month.

<a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/facial-recognition-market-101061">Fortune Business Insights predicts</a> that the global market for facial recognition technology will achieve a remarkable $12.92 billion by 2027, with a compound annual growth rate of 14.8 percent over 2019. Further, RecFaces cites a prediction by <a href="https://inkwoodresearch.com/reports/latin-america-biometrics-market/">Inkwood Research</a> that face biometrics technology will be particularly successful in Latin America, with its market to reach $8 million by 2027-2028, exceeding the global growth rate.

A notable Latin American case study comes from Jockey Plaza, a shopping center in Curitiba, Brazil, spanning 200,000 square meters, accommodating 400 stores and 28 food establishments.

To combat theft, the facility collaborated with <a href="https://francazasecurity.com/">Francaza</a>, a Brazilian integrator, and <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/recfaces">RecFaces</a>, a facial recognition solution developer, to implement <a href="https://recfaces.com/products/id-guard">Id-Guard</a> facial identification software. The system, which integrates with the center's video surveillance and analytics systems, offers biometric identification, real-time and retrospective face search, and stoplisting capabilities.

RecFaces' Id-Guard operates only with biometric templates to perform identification operations. Reverse conversion of a biometric template to an actual facial image is not possible. This data storage method adheres to international <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/gdpr">GDPR</a> data protection regulations and is supplemented by AES-256 standard encryption mechanisms, according to the case study.

Using the new system, Jockey Plaza experienced a 50 percent reduction in shoplifting instances, faster crime resolutions and increased security system efficiency, leading to a payback period of less than three years for the project.

"The moment a person on the stop-list enters the camera's field of view, the operator is immediately notified. Based on our experience, implementation of Id-Guard saves security specialists time as they no longer have to spend hours sifting through video footage when investigating incidents," says Francaza’s CIO, Cristiano J S Maffessoni.

		In an interview with <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/dutch-chipmaker-proposes-biometric-uidai-project/articleshow/102241611.cms?from=mdr">Times of India</a>, Hitesh Garg, VP and country manager of <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/nxp-semiconductors">NXP Semiconductors</a> India, disclosed that NXP is currently engaged in preliminary discussions with the Indian government concerning a project linked to the Unique Identification Authority of India (<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/uidai">UIDAI</a>) authentication. The project under consideration aims to develop a chip-based UIDAI authentication system incorporating biometric data.

Garg revealed that NXP has already successfully implemented a biometric authentication system for electronic passports in India, Bangladesh, and Europe, which he believes could also be adapted for the UIDAI project. Peru is also issuing <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202207/peru-issues-7m-digital-id-cards-with-id3-biometrics-nxp-chips">digital ID cards</a> that support biometric authentication with NXP chips.

Furthermore, Garg expressed NXP Semiconductors' commitment to becoming a technology partner in various upcoming Indian chip-manufacturing initiatives. "Our research and development workforce globally stands at 12,000 people, with 35 percent of this talent based in India. We remain open to investing in Gujarat and collaborating with the local ecosystem when the right opportunity arises," he states.

The potential implementation of a chip-based biometric authentication solution could significantly enhance the security and efficiency of UIDAI services, reinforcing the Indian government's efforts to ensure secure digital identification for its citizens.

## Still dealing with leak fallout, NADRA officials resist investigations

		There appears to be no central government policy in Pakistan for how to handle a catastrophic divulging and selling of citizens' personal data. Or maybe there is no agreed upon checklist.

Either way, following the reported vulnerability of every Pakistani's personal information held by the nation's ultimate data authority, it is unclear who can or should investigate the crime.

In fact, it is difficult from a distance to know when this leak, which, if reports are accurate, could affect all 240 million Pakistanis. <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202111/nadra-rejects-biometric-database-hacking-allegation-seeks-explanation">Large leaks</a> of <a href="https://dailytimes.com.pk/1080379/nadra-confirms-data-theft-of-pakistan-army-chiefs-family/">personal data</a>, allegedly absconded from the National Database Registration Authority, seem to have happened periodically since at least 2018.

It is difficult to ascertain with confidence when this landmark leak of digital ID data took place.<em> Biometric Update </em>has reached out to NADRA to clarify the details of the latest breach.

<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/pakistan-id-agency-head-resigns-citing-polarized-political-environment">Alarming news bulletins</a> involving NADRA, Pakistan's central government digital ID database, have been popping up since the beginning of July.

Perhaps the most alarming of them are articles describing in-fighting and turf wars.

The Federal Investigation Agency wants to look into the matter, but according to numerous accounts, NADRA is either slow-walking cooperation or <a href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/2428025/pac-concerned-over-nadra-data-leak">refusing</a> to share any data at all.

It appears a government inquiry was underway, but, according to local news outlet The Express Tribune, a High Court judge ended the inquiry.

Noor Alam Khan, chair of the parliament's Public Accounts Committee, is said to have told the FIA to show the judge the personal information of his family's that has been leaked.

The leak and resulting confusion have not derailed NADRA, however.

Officials this week <a href="https://www.nation.com.pk/31-Jul-2023/local-govt-nadra-sign-mou-to-improve-public-services">announced</a> they have signed a memo of understanding between its staff and those of the Department of Municipalities and Rural Development about improving the collection of birth and death certificates.

## Kenya targets Feb. 2024 for new digital ID rollout, sign-up optional

		The Kenyan government says it plans to register all citizens for a new digital ID program by the end of this year, and the new digital ID cards will be issued from at least February 2024.

The country’s Cabinet Secretary for Information, Communication and Digital Economy, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/digital-id-key-in-kenyas-digital-transformation-agenda-eliud-owalo">Eliud Owalo</a>, made the announcement recently as he unveiled the government’s one-year status report on its digital transformation exploits, The Standard <a href="https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/national/article/2001478381/digital-identity-cards-are-not-mandatory-cs-owalo-says">reports</a>.

According to Owalo, it will be up to Kenyans to choose whether they want to sign up to the digital ID program or not. However, the government’s objective, he said, is to ensure that citizens have easy access to public and private sector services, even from the comfort of their homes.

The Huduma Namba digital ID, which the new system seeks to replace, was compulsory.

“We will not force any Kenyan to take a digital identity. No, the onus will be on you to decide whether or not you want to get government services through your digital identity based on your bio-data or you want to physically visit government offices,” the news outlet quotes the cabinet secretary as saying.

He explained that Kenya is rolling out the new ID system in line with the experience taped from countries such as Belgium, Estonia and Pakistan, where similar projects have been successfully implemented.

Owalo said although scepticism may arise partly as a result of the bitter experience from the controversial Huduma Namba ID project, “we believe that we can leverage on skills, competencies, and capabilities within Kenyans themselves and undertake these programs.”

He also gave assurances that the government is making sure funds are not spent carelessly on the project.

The new digital ID project is part of a mega digital transformation plan which recently saw the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/cyberattack-on-kenyas-digital-infrastructure-continues">digitization of 5,000 government services</a>, accessible via a digital government platform launched recently by President William Ruto.

Owalo said there are plans to digitize 9,000 more services under the plan, NTV Kenya <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA8uL0gZsJQ">reports</a>.

With the new system, government officials will also be able to use a digital signature platform to sign official documents even while away from their duty posts, Owalo added.

“The digital ID system we are talking about is not the same like the Huduma Namba,” Owalo emphasizes.

The status report chronicles what the government has been able to do so far in terms of the digital transformation drive, as well as the road still ahead to be covered.

## Philippines urged to consider biometric voter authentication during 2025 polls

		The Commission on Elections of the Philippines (Comelec) is seeking to upgrade its election management system with the procurement of a Fully Automated System with Transparency Audit and Count (FASTrAC).

The move has been described as laudable but a Computer Science Associate Professor at the University of the Philippines, Rommel Feria, is wondering why the election agency is not going for a system that would allow voter verification and authentication to be done using biometric data collected during voter registration.

In a <a href="https://mb.com.ph/2023/7/31/from-pcos-to-fas-tr-ac">comment</a> for the Manila Bulletin, Feria says the Terms of Reference (TOR) for the supply of the equipment makes no mention of biometrics, “which means that the machine will not be equipped with the biometric scanner, nor will it securely store the mathematical representation of the biometric data on the machine.”

“Imagine utilizing the biometrics of authorized personnel when logging in on the machine instead of a username, password and the USB hardware key? I do not know why Comelec has wasted this opportunity to fully use the data they have collected,” the academic muses.

Comelec has even suggested <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/philippines-wants-to-add-iris-biometrics-to-tackle-double-voter-registration">adding iris biometrics</a> to the voter registration system to improve its ability to find double registrations.

Apart from the issue of biometrics, Feria also questions why the Comelec is going for proprietary software for the new system, instead of one in which “the full software stack of the machine can be audited completely by using free, open-source software.”

Thirdly, Feria notes that the TOR make no mention of how potential vulnerabilities with the new system can be fixed. He however expresses the wish to see these and many other questions addressed during the pre-bid.

In a related story, a Filipino elections watchdog, the National Movement for Free Elections (NAMFREL), has also called on Comelec to ensure a fully transparent procurement process and one that will be fair to both local and international potential bidders, according to <a href="https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2023/07/31/2285189/comelec-should-ensure-transparent-fully-auditable-2025-midterm-elections-namfrel">Philstar Global</a>.

The entity has also called for congressional action that will make it possible for Filipino firms to bid for the contract, urging the election agency to also consider the factors of “cost-effectiveness, accessibility and inclusivity, reliability, security, safety, and fairness” in the procurement process.

While NAMFREL has insisted that the system to be acquired must be auditable, it recommends that it shouldn’t be based on proprietary or locked-in technology which could make reviewing it difficult, echoing Professor Feria.

The outfit has also called for the process to be competitive enough in order not to appear to favour one bidder over another.

		Technical and policy standards for digital identity are emerging and evolving, boosting the prospects for interoperable digital IDs, and correspondingly drawing in more organizations that see a benefit from that interoperability to encourage its development.

The vision for a “Global Assured Identity Network” shared by six digital identity organizations is presented in the new “<a href="https://openid.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/GAIN-in-2023.pdf">GAIN in 2023</a>” white paper.

The Cloud Signature Consortium, Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF), OpenID, Open Identity Exchange and Secure Identity Alliance collectively represent many of the largest and most influential businesses and stakeholders in the ID market. These organizations have agreed to provide guidance and spaces for community collaboration.

There are an increasing number of organizations, including banks, governments, and wallet providers, that can make use of interoperable policy and technical standards for digital identity, according to the paper. At the same time, those standards have matured, making room for more interoperability testing.

That is the context in which the 30-page paper, edited by <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202304/idpartner-corrals-a-posse-to-close-3-1-million-seed-round">IDPartner</a> Co-founder and CPO Elizabeth Garber, OIX Chief Identity Strategist <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/how-uks-diatf-can-boost-e-signatures-evidentiary-value">Nick Mothershaw</a>, SIA Marketing and Communication Director Stephanie Labriolle and <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/thales-digital-identity-and-security">Thales</a> Standardization Expert Deborah Comparin, has been released.

A proof-of-concepts working group has over 40 participants, trust frameworks have been analyzed, and tools to establish stronger trust between entities have been developed over the past two years by GAIN.

Major contributions reviewed in the paper include a demonstration of cross-border data transfers, progress towards the development of identities for organizations that deliver high trust and can be used beyond financial services, and work on how trust frameworks in different countries can provide a basis for trusted interactions.

The paper focusses on how to bridge “<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202206/eic-2022-openid-foundation-and-oix-map-islands-of-trust-for-digital-id">islands of trust</a>,” trusting counterparties, smart policy interoperability and open collaboration and governance.

The GAIN <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202209/gain-one-year-in-demos-successful-but-plenty-of-work-ahead-to-reach-global-interoperability">POC Community Group</a> has tested a working prototype connecting digital ID systems in Germany, Italy and Japan. It will work on operationalizing the PoC, bridging the emerging “islands,” including digital wallets, and look into other trust establishment models.

OIX is examining trust frameworks in Canada, the EU, Singapore, UK and U.S. to assess the potential for an “Open Policy Rules Exchange Framework.”

The paper concludes with an invitation to non-profits in the field of identity to participate in GAIN’s collaborations.

		<em>By Arif Mamedov, President and CEO at <a href="https://regulaforensics.com/">Regula Forensics, Inc.</a> </em>

From July 19 to July 21, the Legal Identity, Biometrics &amp; Border Management Conference 2023 took place in the heart of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Hosted by EUROFRONT, the invite-only event gathered representatives of government authorities responsible for identity and border management in the LatAm region.

The EUROFRONT program, funded by the European Commission, is a platform for peer learning and sharing best practices and experiences between regions. The aim is to create collaborative networks with local, national, and regional stakeholders, promote Integrated Border Management, and fight against trafficking and smuggling of migrants.

During three days, representatives from eight countries — Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, and El Salvador — as well as the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and INTERPOL, shared their expertise, as well as the latest official information on migration data and trends.

Regula was invited to the event as a partner of the IOM. Here’s a breakdown of some of the highlights of the conference.
<h2>Strengthening the foundations of identity management</h2>
The conference began with an emphasis on the importance of robust identity management systems. Government officials from LatAm countries highlighted their efforts to establish comprehensive legal identity frameworks that not only guarantee security but also promote inclusivity and protection of individual human rights.

The absence of official documents proving the legal identity of a person can often make it impossible for millions of people around the world to enjoy their rights. Facilitating access to legal identity for migrants is a fundamental requirement for a human rights-based approach.

While border control measures tend to focus on enforcing immigration laws, effective identity governance goes beyond borders. The goal is to create a strong link between individuals and their legally registered identities, contributing to more effective implementation of security policies, while guaranteeing fundamental rights.

Countries shared their experiences in implementing national identity programs, showcasing success stories that have facilitated access to essential services while bolstering security measures against identity fraud.
<h2>Leveraging biometrics for enhanced border control</h2>
A central theme of the conference was the utilization of biometric technologies to fortify border management strategies. Biometrics was extensively discussed as a reliable tool to identify and verify individuals at border crossings.

Attendees had the opportunity to witness live demonstrations of cutting-edge biometric systems, highlighting their accuracy, efficiency, and potential to significantly expedite border processes.
<h2>Addressing ethical and privacy concerns</h2>
As biometrics and digital identity systems advance, so do the ethical and privacy implications. With an increasing reliance on data-driven technologies, conference participants engaged in thoughtful dialogues on the need for responsible data governance, the responsible use and sharing of biometrics, and the preservation of individual privacy rights. This was a critical concern, especially considering the interconnected nature of data-sharing agreements between nations for cross-border identification.
<h2>Enhancing regional cooperation</h2>
Collaboration between the states was highlighted as an essential factor in creating robust and interconnected identity and border management systems. Representatives from various countries discussed the potential for regional cooperation to address common challenges, share best practices, and streamline cross-border travel while maintaining the highest standards of security.
<h2>Innovation showcase: Regula's contribution</h2>
As a trusted partner of IOM, Regula played an instrumental role in the conference by showcasing their cutting-edge identity verification technologies.

Regula's solutions, centered around document authentication and biometric verification, garnered significant attention from participants. Most of them were interested in the functionality of document readers that already have proven traction being integrated with MIDAS, the IOM border management system.

In addition to the showcase, the company gave a presentation on the facial morphing threat, a document forgery method that can potentially enable different people to use the same credentials.

The presentation also highlighted the ease of use, accuracy, and robustness of the Regula 4325 device, especially the possibility of detecting morphed photographs in real time.

High interest in the topic, along with strong networking, underlines the participants' commitment to advancing secure identity solutions in the LatAm region and beyond.
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
The Legal Identity, Biometrics &amp; Border Management Conference 2023 in Buenos Aires was a resounding success in fostering knowledge exchange, promoting regional collaboration, and encouraging the adoption of innovative technologies in identity and border management.

With the collective determination of government authorities, industry experts, and international organizations, the conference has taken a step closer to achieving enhanced security, streamlined border processes, and protected individual rights across the Latin American region.

As participants return to their respective countries armed with newfound insights, the path to a safer, more inclusive future becomes clearer than ever before.
