But there are a number of scenarios where it makes sense to download videos for later viewing. If you want to watch a video on the train or bus, for example, or if films threaten to disappear from a media library. The <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Video-Audio-Downloader-software-YouTube/dp/B0C46GX5J4&amp;xcust=2-1-2012328-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">$19.99 Video and Audio Downloader Pro 2 software</a> was made for just those cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The software can download audio and videos not just from YouTube, but also from all public media libraries and save them on your local storage. In our testing, this worked smoothly even while downloading several videos simultaneously, and even with 8K resolution videos. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Downloading media is not possible if the videos are behind a paywall, however; Video and Audio Downloader Pro 2 cannot download Netflix or Disney Plus videos, for example. This is also explained in the documentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Downloading playlists from YouTube is a new function in version 2 of the software and worked without any problems in our testing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Operating the software couldn&rsquo;t be any simpler. You simply surf to a video (or playlist) in your browser, copy the link from its address bar, and paste it into the input field of the software.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Video-Audio-Downloader-software-YouTube/dp/B0C46GX5J4&amp;xcust=2-1-2012328-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Video and Audio Downloader Pro 2</a> offers a simple download option for free streaming videos that are not behind a paywall.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"cta wp-block wp-block-button\"><a class=\"cta__btn\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Video-Audio-Downloader-software-YouTube/dp/B0C46GX5J4&amp;xcust=2-1-2012328-7-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Get Video and Audio Downloader Pro 2 at Amazon for $19.99</a></p>\nPersonal Software</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2012328/video-and-audio-downloader-pro-2-review.html", "date_published": "2023-08-01T17:44:06+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Autonomous SmartDesk Pro review: A stylish, spectacular standing desk", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n<div class=\"review\" id=\"review-body\"><span class=\"review-title\">At a glance</span><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"experts-rating\">Expert's Rating</h3><div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n<div><div class=\"review-columns\"><div class=\"review-column\"><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"pros\">Pros</h3><ul class=\"pros review-list\"><li>Attractive yet solid design</li><li><span>Good range of height adjustment</span></li><li>Extensive customisation options</li></ul></div><div class=\"review-column\"><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"cons\">Cons</h3><ul class=\"cons review-list\"><li>Frustrating initial setup</li><li>Height adjustment could be more intuitive</li></ul></div></div></div><h3 class=\"review-subTitle review-subTitle--borderTop\" id=\"our-verdict\">Our Verdict</h3><p class=\"verdict\">The SmartDesk Pro is a stylish, well-built standing desk with a range of heights to suit almost everyone.

If you don&rsquo;t mind a smaller height range and shorter warranty, you may well be happy with the cheaper model.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading toc\" id=\"features-design\">Features &amp; design</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mains-powered&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Height range 66.5 &ndash; 132cm&nbsp;/ 26.2&rdquo; to 52&rdquo;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Up to four saved positions&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The SmartDesk Pro is a electrical-powered, motor-driven standing desk. So if you ever want to adjust its height, you&rsquo;ll need to have it plugged in. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The perk of that is that, unlike desks such as the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techadvisor.com/article/722886/bakker-elkhuizen-work-move-desk-home-review.html&amp;xcust=2-3-2015662-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bakker Elkhuizen Work &amp; Move</a>, you don&rsquo;t need to put in any effort yourself to raise or lower the desk: just a push of a button will do the trick.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Autonomous SmartDesk Pro review\" class=\"wp-image-2013318\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/autonomous-smartdesk-pro-review-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Autonomous</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Counting the desktop, it can range from 26.2-inches to 52-inches in height, which is a pretty impressive range. I&rsquo;m 5&rsquo;11&rdquo;, and the desk goes lower than I can comfortably sit and higher than I could realistically stand. Despite the motor, it&rsquo;s impressively quiet while adjusting too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A small control panel on the right-hand side lets you raise and lower the desk, and also includes four buttons for custom saved settings. You could easily set ideal sitting and standing heights for two different people.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>The desk goes lower than I can comfortably sit and higher than I could realistically stand</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The only odd downside to these is that just pressing the button doesn&rsquo;t move the desk to the right spot &mdash; you have to hold the button the whole time, and then the motor will stop once it hits the correct height. It&rsquo;s a minor annoyance, but quickly becomes tedious.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the US, the desk is available with a choice of three different desktop sizes. But they&rsquo;re not all available internationally: in the UK, only the middle size is available sale. It&rsquo;s still generously sized at 135x74cm, though, and fits my dual monitor work setup.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Autonomous SmartDesk Pro review\" class=\"wp-image-2013304\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/autonomous-smartdesk-pro-review-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Autonomous</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The top comes in a range of both solid color, wood, and bamboo finishes, while the steel frame is available in white, black, or grey. Between all those choices, you should be able to get a style that suits your home office.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever finish you pick, the desk has a sleek, modern look. It also benefits from useful cable management holes to help you keep everything tidy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading toc\" id=\"setup-build-quality\">Setup &amp; build quality</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Setup takes up to an hour&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Slightly unclear instructions&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If I have a major complaint, it&rsquo;s that setting up the SmartDesk Pro took more time, effort, and tools than I would have liked.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Setting up the SmartDesk Pro took more time, effort, and tools than I would have liked</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a fair few bits you&rsquo;ve got to screw, wire, and assemble, and the company&rsquo;s included instructions are at times cryptic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mounting the frame onto the desk was especially troublesome, with no guidelines given on how to line everything up right. It only really requires fairly basic DIY skills, but it is a step above your average Ikea flatpack in difficulty.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once assembled it is at least pretty solid &mdash; well, assuming you do it about right &ndash;s helped by the solid steel legs and wide feet. There&rsquo;s an occasional light wobble to the table top (hard to avoid entirely) but never the feeling that things might actually go wrong.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Autonomous SmartDesk Pro review\" class=\"wp-image-2013311\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/autonomous-smartdesk-pro-review-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Autonomous</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading toc\" id=\"price-availability\">Price &amp; availability</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the US, the SmartDesk Pro starts at $499. That gets you the smallest 43&times;24-inch tabletop, while the 53&times;29-inch regular model I tested costs at least $599. There&rsquo;s also a 70.5&times;30-inch XL version starting at $949. All three are available from the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.autonomous.ai/standing-desks/smartdesk-2-business&amp;xcust=2-3-2015662-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Autonomous store</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prices in the rest of the world are based on conversions from the US price, so will vary depending on the exchange rate.&nbsp;In the UK, only the regular model is available, starting at &pound;718.80 via the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.autonomous.ai/en-GB/standing-desks/smartdesk-2-business&amp;xcust=2-3-2015662-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Autonomous store</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s a pretty fair price considering everything you&rsquo;re getting, but there are more affordable standing desks out there, including Autonomous&rsquo; own SmartDesk Core. It starts at <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.autonomous.ai/standing-desks/smartdesk-2-home&amp;xcust=2-3-2015662-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$399</a>/<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.autonomous.ai/en-GB/standing-desks/smartdesk-2-home&amp;xcust=2-3-2015662-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">&pound;538.80</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading toc\" id=\"verdict\">Verdict</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Autonomous SmartDesk Pro is a solid standing desk that&rsquo;s definitely worth considering. Its customization options are a key strength, with plenty of different finishes, sizes (if you&rsquo;re in the US) and heights all available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Four preset heights make moving between them easier, but having to hold down the button quickly gets annoying. That&rsquo;s the only day-to-day frustration, though &mdash; after the complicated setup, there&rsquo;s very little to complain about here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for an attractive, versatile standing desk that&rsquo;s still solidly built, the SmartDesk Pro could be for you. Just make sure it&rsquo;s the right Autonomous desk for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor&rsquo;s note: This review originally appeared on techadvisor.com.</em></p>\n\nComputer Accessories</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2015662/autonomous-smartdesk-pro-review-standing-desk.html", "date_published": "2023-08-01T17:26:54+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Smart Answers: GenAI tool makes it easier to find the info you need on PCWorld", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Today PCWorld is launching Smart Answers, a chatbot tool that helps you get more from our content. It&rsquo;s built using Generative AI and existing content written by our human editors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way we interact with content is changing. It wasn&rsquo;t so long ago you would have sifted through a printed magazine for advice on the latest consumer technology, yet it felt like a revolution when those old mags switched over to digital and online editions. These days, everything you could ever want to read is on the internet&mdash;or just as likely on YouTube or TikTok. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The difficulty comes in finding trustworthy, up-to-date information that precisely and immediately answers your question, and most of us tend to rely on search engines and algorithms to figure that out for us, with varying degrees of success. But faced with a page full of links to visually similar content, you&rsquo;re still a step away from the information you need&mdash;two steps, in fact, if you need to further refine your query.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smart Answers is our new reader service that turns content discovery on its head. You control the questions, the answers, and the delivery. It&rsquo;s like having a PCWorld editor at your beck and call, allowing you to request and receive specific content on demand. So, why wait for the content to find you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&rsquo;ve worked in partnership with <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://miso.ai/&amp;xcust=2-3-2013610-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">MISO.AI</a> to develop Smart Answers, a GenAI tool (see <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.infoworld.com/article/3689973/what-is-generative-ai-the-evolution-of-artificial-intelligence.html&amp;xcust=2-3-2013610-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\">What is GenAI?</a>) that draws <em>only </em>on <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://foundryco.com/&amp;xcust=2-3-2013610-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\">Foundry</a>&lsquo;s complete catalog of English-language content (written by humans) to answer your natural-language questions.

You can ask it anything, from what is the best laptop for gaming to which printer should you buy for your home office, or even when is the next CPU family coming out, or how do you speed up your PC. You&rsquo;ll get an answer in seconds. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s like having a PCWorld editor at your beck and call&hellip; why wait for the content to find you?</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ask it a follow-up question too, if you like, or browse the recommended reading for more detail on the topic. Smart Answers is clever enough to work out what you may want to ask next, and it will even show you best pricing for related products and services to avoid you having to search it out yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smart Answers has been trained on the type of tech-related questions our readers are likely to ask. Ask it a silly or irrelevant question, and you&rsquo;ll either get a silly or irrelevant answer, or no answer at all. Our priority is to ensure Smart Answers is able to adequately respond to questions on the topics we do cover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though Smart Answers is intrinsically linked to our editorial content, our editorial function stands independently. No article published on this site has been created using GenAI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Extensive testing has been conducted by our editors over a period of many months, with our feedback used to retrain the model. We wouldn&rsquo;t be rolling this out today if we were not confident that the answers it provides are as trustworthy, as if they had come direct from our editorial team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This cycle of testing, feedback and retraining is ongoing, and will be important as we continue to add functionality to Smart Answers. Today our <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/smart-answers\">Smart Answers page</a> goes live, but over the coming week you will also find a Smart Answers block on our home page and within our articles. And this is just the start of a process that will ultimately put you in charge of your own content experience across Foundry-owned sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, the real testing comes from you. We&rsquo;ll be analyzing all search data collected by Smart Answers, and cross-checking the quality of responses, but we&rsquo;d also love to hear your feedback.

Unlike ChatGPT, Google Bard and other GenAI tools that source their information from all over the web, Smart Answers has been trained only on content written by Foundry journalists. It responds to queries posed in natural language with a summarized answer and links to related information.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">2.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading toc\" id=\"what-is-genai\">What is GenAI?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>Short for Generative AI, GenAI is a type of artificial intelligence that is able to mimic the neural networks of the human brain and, through machine learning of existing content, generate entirely new content in the form of text, images, video and audio. When given a prompt, such as a piece of natural-language text, the computational power of GenAI allows it to deliver an answer much faster than can the human brain. </p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">3.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading toc\" id=\"can-i-trust-smart-answers\">Can I trust Smart Answers?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>Yes. Smart Answers provides answers based on articles written by Foundry journalists and does not use data from any external sources, which could be unreliable or subject to copyright concerns. Extensive testing has gone on behind the scenes to help train the model, so we are satisfied that it is able to provide reliable information. We&rsquo;ve also worked hard with partner MISO.AI to eliminate &ldquo;hallucinations,&rdquo; which are misleading or wholly incorrect answers that may be given when the answer is not known or the data required to answer the question is incomplete.

Smart Answers cannot exist without the expert content written by Foundry journalists.

If you don&rsquo;t mind the lackluster battery life, this is a great laptop for watching movies and writing research papers on. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/624297/acer-swift-3-review-a-16-inch-laptop-for-the-rest-of-us.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAcer Swift 3 SF316-51 review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-separator\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart-item product-chart-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper--title product-chart-title \" id=\"asus-vivobook-pro-15-best-gaming-laptop-under-1000\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAsus Vivobook Pro 15 &ndash; Best gaming laptop under $1,000\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"large-pro-cons-product-chart-section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproduct-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper--large\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Asus Vivobook Pro 15 - Best gaming laptop under $1,000\" class=\"product-chart-item__image\" height=\"843\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Lenovo-IdeaPad-Slim-7-Carbon-overview.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1265\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-columns\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tGood productivity performance\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tSuperb display\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tRugged design\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tGreat battery life\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tBoring aesthetics\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tUnimpressive 720p webcam\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tUnreliable fingerprint scanner\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tPoor port selection\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__information \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-label\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$1099.99\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"not-amp\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://shop.asus.com/us/90nb0uv2-m004k0-vivobook-pro-15-oled-k3500-11th-gen-intel.html?&amp;xcust=2-2-394735-6-611633-11291&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$919.99 at  Asus</a><a class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/321564/633495/10014?prodsku=6486646&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.bestbuy.com%2Fclick%2F-%2F6486646%2Fpdp&amp;intsrc=CATF_4831&amp;subid1=2-2-394735-6-611633-11291\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$919.99 at  Best Buy</a><a class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/321564/1175784/1036?prodsku=ASK35PHDB51&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fask35phdb51.html&amp;intsrc=CATF_9102&amp;subid1=2-2-394735-6-611633-11291\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$929.99 at  Adorama</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>The Asus Vivobook Pro 15 provides an outstanding price-to-performance ratio. Sporting a Ryzen 7 processor, an RTX 3050 GPU, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB M.2 NVMe hard drive, this laptop includes a lot of the same performance components of higher-end alternatives but for much cheaper. While the performance features are admirable, what makes the Vivobook Pro 15 stand out from the rest of the sub-$1,000 crowd is the stunning 15.6-inch OLED display. It&rsquo;s almost unheard of to get an OLED screen on a laptop for this price and it doesn&rsquo;t disappoint either, giving crisp visuals and a near-perfect contrast ratio.</p>\n\n<p>The overall design of the Vivobook Pro 15 is a little lackluster, but that&rsquo;s not what this laptop is about. Asus wasn&rsquo;t trying to beat premium laptops on design or build quality with this model. They instead wanted to load it with so much power and performance that the design doesn&rsquo;t didn&rsquo;t matter&mdash;and it was a success. For the price of a budget-friendly gaming laptop, the Asus Vivobook Pro 15 gives you the power and features of a much more expensive midrange option.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/611294/asus-vivobook-pro-15-oled-review-oled-and-rtx-at-a-reasonable-price.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tASUS VivoBook Pro 15 OLED Ultra Slim Laptop review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-separator\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart-item product-chart-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper--title product-chart-title \" id=\"acer-aspire-3-best-under-500\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAcer Aspire 3 &ndash;

Well, with its affordable price point, decent performance, and robust build, the Acer Aspire 3 is an excellent option for under $500. In our testing we were surprised by its solid, durable feel and suitable work productivity performance. The spacious full-sized keyboard and trackpad is quite nice, too. While the battery isn&rsquo;t outstanding, our tests showed that it can provide up to eight hours of charge without having to be plugged in&mdash;that&rsquo;s solid and enough for most full workdays. Performance is fast enough for general-use tasks like writing emails and browsing the web, but that is about the limit. Still, if the basics will do and you&rsquo;re shopping around for a solid everyday laptop that won&rsquo;t break the bank, the Aspire 3 is definitely worth a look.   </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1989517/acer-aspire-3-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAcer Aspire 3 (2022) review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-separator\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart-item product-chart-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper--title product-chart-title \" id=\"lenovo-chromebook-flex-5-best-chromebook\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLenovo Chromebook Flex 5 &ndash; Best Chromebook\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"large-pro-cons-product-chart-section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproduct-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper--large\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5 - Best Chromebook\" class=\"product-chart-item__image\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/lenovo-chromebook-flex-5-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1500\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-columns\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tAttractive design\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tAffordable\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tPunchy audio\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tExcellent keyboard\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tMediocre performance\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tSubpar battery life\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__information \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-label\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$389\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"not-amp\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/321564/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;subid1=2-2-394735-6-564191-11281&amp;u=https://goto.walmart.com/c/321564/1285387/9383?prodsku=334577104&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLenovo-Chromebook-Flex-5-13in-Laptop-Intel-i3-10110U-4GB-RAM-64GB-SSD-Chrome-OS%2F334577104&amp;intsrc=CATF_9768\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$329.96 at  Walmart Affiliate Program</a><a class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086383HC7?tag=pcworld02-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$344.97 at  Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>The Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5 is a good mid-range Chromebook. It&rsquo;s fast enough for web browsing, editing documents, and so on. That said, it can &ldquo;feel taxed by demanding tasks.&rdquo; When our tester opened up multiple tabs, he noticed a sag in performance. The port selection, however, is nice combination of old and new. It has two USB-C ports, a single USB-A port, a 3.5mm combo audio jack, and a microSD card reader. As for the keyboard, our tester liked the &ldquo;crisp and taut&rdquo; feel of the keys. Although this laptop is a 2-in-1&mdash;meaning the screen can fold back to make it function more like a tablet&mdash;it weighs about 3 pounds, which is on the heavier side for a convertible laptop. It may not be the most portable laptop in the world, but that flexibility can still be nice for applications that favor a tablet form factor.  </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/564116/lenovo-chromebook-flex-5-review-the-reasonable-choice.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLenovo Chromebook Flex 5 review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-separator\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart-item product-chart-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper--title product-chart-title \" id=\"hp-chromebook-x2-11-da0023dx-best-folio-style-chromebook\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHP Chromebook x2 11 da0023dx &ndash; Best folio-style Chromebook\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"large-pro-cons-product-chart-section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproduct-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper--large\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"HP Chromebook x2 11 da0023dx - Best folio-style Chromebook\" class=\"product-chart-item__image\" height=\"3024\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hpchromebook-hero.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"4032\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-columns\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tGorgeous 2K touchscreen\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tSolid performance\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tExcellent battery life\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tRobust design\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tTrackpad is too sensitive at times\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tLight on ports\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__information \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-label\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$599\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"not-amp\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B2BLH1ZB?tag=pcworld02-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$229.95 at  Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>Ah, folio-style laptops. While some may find the detachable-keyboard design a pain to deal with, our reviewer really liked this one. The HP Chromebook x2 11 is one of the best 2-in-1 laptops you can buy. The tablet&rsquo;s aluminum chassis feels rugged and like it&rsquo;ll last quite a while. The detachable keyboard took some getting used to, but ended up being fine for long typing sessions. The rear plate, which transforms into a kickstand that holds up the tablet for hands-free use, connects to the back of the tablet via magnets. The reviewer found the connection to be both clean and strong. As for the performance, it&rsquo;s about what you&rsquo;d expect out of a Chromebook.

Made from 30 percent post-consumer recycled materials, it is blazing a path for more eco-friendly options in our personal electronics. It&rsquo;s no slouch in the performance department either, sporting a Core i7 CPU, Intel Iris Xe Graphics, a solid 16GB of RAM, and a surprisingly large 1TB M.2 SSD. The only real drawbacks are the odd decision from Acer to solder on the RAM so it can&rsquo;t be upgraded in the future, and the fact that it comes with some unwelcome bloatware. But both issues are minor and the bloatware can be removed with just a little bit of effort after purchase. Overall, the Acer Aspire Vero 14 provides decent performance and makes the decision to buy a new computer weigh a little less on your conscience thanks to its eco-friendly design.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1358891/acer-aspire-vero-14-review-from-trash-to-treasure.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAcer Aspire Vero 14 review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-we-tested\">How we tested</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The PCWorld team puts each and every Windows laptop through a series of benchmarks that test GPU and CPU performance, battery life, and so on. The idea is to push the laptop to its limits and then compare it against others we&rsquo;ve tested. Chromebooks, on the other hand, go through a series of web-based tests. It wouldn&rsquo;t be fair or possible to run the same kinds of tests on a Chromebook, as they&rsquo;re Chrome OS-based machines. Below, you&rsquo;ll find a breakdown of each test and the reasons why we run them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"windows-laptops\">Windows laptops</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>PCMark 10</strong>: PCMark 10 is how we determine how well the laptop handles lighter tasks like web browsing, word processing, spreadsheets, and so on.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>HandBrake</strong>: HandBrake is more intensive than PCMark 10. It basically measures how long a laptop&rsquo;s CPU takes to encode a beefy 30GB file. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cinebench</strong>: Cinebench is a brief stress test of the CPU cores. It does this by rendering a 2D scene over a short period of time.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>3DMark</strong>: 3DMark checks if 3D performance remains consistent over time by running graphic-intensive clips. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Video rundown test</strong>: To gauge battery life, we loop a 4K video using Windows 10&rsquo;s Movies &amp; TV app until the laptop dies.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chromebooks\">Chromebooks</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>CrXPRT 2</strong>: The CrXPRT 2 benchmark tests a Chromebook&rsquo;s battery life. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Speedometer 2.0</strong>: This test determines a Chromebook&rsquo;s web browser performance. It simulates this by adding, completing, and removing a to-do list.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Basemark Web 3.0</strong>: This benchmark gauges how well a Chromebook can handle web-based applications. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Kraken 1.1</strong>: Kraken 1.1 is a JavaScript performance benchmark. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Jetstream 2</strong>: Jetstream 2 is a combination of WebAssembly and JavaScript benchmarks. This is a way to gauge how well a Chromebook runs advanced workloads.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-to-pick-a-laptop-under-1000\">How to pick a laptop under $1,000</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ah, here we are at the million dollar question. Do you spring for a basic Chromebook or go for a Windows laptop with more features? Well, it really depends on your personal lifestyle and what you plan on using your laptop for. For example, Chromebooks are a great low cost option for those who just want the basics. I use a Chromebook as my primary work laptop, as it has everything I need for both editing and writing. If you travel a bunch for work, it&rsquo;s probably a good idea to invest in a laptop with solid battery life. If you&rsquo;re still unsure, don&rsquo;t sweat it. I&rsquo;ve put together a list of quick tips below. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What laptop type should I choose?<strong> </strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s traditional clamshells, 2-in-1&rsquo;s, Chromebooks, and much more. The displays on convertible laptops (aka 2-in-1&rsquo;s), for example, can swing around 360 degrees. This allows you to use the laptop like a tablet. They can also be propped up like a tent for viewing movies or participating in video calls. Chromebooks, on the other hand, exclusively run Google&rsquo;s web-focused Chrome OS and are generally used for everyday tasks. All you need is a Gmail account and boom, you&rsquo;re in. There are pros and cons to each of them. Chromebooks are affordable and generally have good battery life whereas convertibles are normally lightweight and portable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Ho</strong>w do I pick a CPU?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If it&rsquo;s CPU power you&rsquo;re looking for, look for processors with higher numerical names. A Core i7 is more suited to gaming and more intense work than everyday tasks. Intel processors are available in Core i3, Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9. The higher the number, the more powerful the CPU. If you don&rsquo;t need a ton of power, Intel Core i5 processors are your best bet, as they offer good performance at a decent price. Basic office and web work gets along just fine on a Core i3. As for AMD options, the Ryzen 3 is good for basic productivity and web browsing, while Ryzen 5 chips rival Intel&rsquo;s Core i5 as solid all-arounders. If you need more power, the Ryzen 7 chip is well suited for content creation like video editing. Finally, if you&rsquo;re dealing with 4K video, spring for a Ryzen 9. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-about-gpus\">What about GPUs?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You&rsquo;ll want a discrete graphics card for hardcore gaming or editing videos. It&rsquo;s separate from the processor, so you can expect higher performance out of it. Integrated graphics, on the other hand, are attached to the CPU and uses less power as a result. This is perfectly fine for everyday tasks, especially if you&rsquo;re not doing anything that&rsquo;s graphics-intensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-much-ram-should-i-look-for\">How much RAM should I look for?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>8GB of RAM is zippy enough for general use. If you&rsquo;ve got a gaming laptop, 16GB of RAM is the way to go, and content creators will want even more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-about-battery-life\">How about battery life?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you plan on taking your laptop anywhere with you, aim for something that can last 10 to 12 hours on a single charge. That&rsquo;s more than a full work day, so it should theoretically get you through long flights or a day of classes. Obviously, more is always better. Just know that the bigger the battery, the heavier the laptop.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-kind-of-ports-should-i-look-for\">What kind of ports should I look for?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A wide array of ports is always a plus in my book, as it eliminates the need for an adapter. I&rsquo;d recommend a laptop that has both USB-C and USB-A. An HDMI port is good, too. This is especially useful for hooking up to an external monitor.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-block faq-block\"><h2 class=\"faq-block-title\" id=\"faq\"> FAQ </h2><hr class=\"block-horizotal-divider\" />\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">1.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"do-chromebooks-make-good-gaming-laptops\"> Do Chromebooks make good gaming laptops? </h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>The short answer is no, but it really depends on the type of gaming you intend to do. Chromebooks will handle web games and Android games just fine. But if you&rsquo;re looking to play the latest high-powered 3D games, a Chromebook won&rsquo;t suffice, because a) it doesn&rsquo;t run Windows, and b) it probably has insufficient graphics power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All that said, Google is working hard to bring cloud gaming to Chromebooks. Cloud gaming services use a remote PC or console to play games streamed through the cloud down onto the Chromebook. Until this service becomes more popular, though, Chromebooks will not be able to compete in the gaming arena.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">2.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"can-integrated-graphics-be-used-for-gaming\"> Can integrated graphics be used for gaming? </h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>Yes, some of the latest processors with integrated graphics can run modern PC games at reasonable settings. For example, Intel&rsquo;s latest Iris Xe line of processors with integrated graphics have been shown to run some of the latest games at 1080p and 30 fps. Be careful, however, as not all integrated graphics are up to the task.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intel and AMD&rsquo;s integrated graphics have made huge leaps in recent years with regard to gaming performance. If you&rsquo;re on a budget or looking for an ultra thin laptop with integrated graphics you can still game on, we recommend checking out <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/633378/laptop-graphics-battle-amd-rdna-2-vs-intel-iris-xe.html\">Intel&rsquo;s Core 12th-gen Iris Xe or AMD&rsquo;s brand new Ryzen 6000 RDNA 2.</a></p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">3.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-size-laptop-is-best\">What size laptop is best?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>This is really personal preference. If you intend to travel a lot with your laptop then a smaller, more portable size in the neighborhood of 13 to 14 inches is recommended. If you want to do gaming on a laptop, then you should look for something in the 15 to 17 inch range. Also, keep in mind the weight of the laptop before you buy it. Ultra thin laptops can weigh a featherlight 2 pounds while beefy gaming computers top the scales at three or four times that.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">4.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-is-an-ultrabook\">What is an Ultrabook?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>Originally a marketing term coined by Intel, it refers to a thin and lightweight laptop that fits somewhere between a tablet and a premium notebook. Ultrabooks typically come with more productivity features than tablets and are designed to be more portable than larger, heavier business laptops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultrabooks are usually around 2cm thick, come with an Intel processor and a fast SSD, have longer than average battery life, and retail for consumer-friendly prices. However, there are so many different Ultrabooks available nowadays that these specifications have become more like general guidelines rather than rigid standards.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n\nGaming Laptops, Laptops</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/394735/best-midrange-laptops-affordable-notebooks-for-work-school-and-gaming.html", "date_published": "2023-08-01T16:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Ultimate backup: Archival M-Discs store your data for 1000 years", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Storing data for the long term is vital.

Digital storage media such as <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407542/best-ssds.html\">hard drives and SSDs</a> can degrade and fail over time.

Therefore, the first way to deal with order confirmation messages should be to go to your Amazon account. There, under &ldquo;Returns and orders,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll find a list of the orders you have actually placed. If you don&rsquo;t see a record of the fake order, the scam is quickly exposed. (If you <em>do </em>see an unauthorized order there, contact Amazon customer service and change your password immediately.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"do-not-disclose-personal-data-by-email-or-telephone\">Do not disclose personal data by email or telephone</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The same thing applies to a request to confirm personal data by email or telephone. If Amazon actually requires personal information, you&rsquo;ll find a notification asking for it in your Amazon account. That is the <em>only </em>place you should divulge sensitive information such as account data, or where addresses should be confirmed and changed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"report-fraud\">Report fraud</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon and many other companies offer the possibility to report suspicious communication.

To do this, right-click on the start menu, then select &ldquo;Device Manager&rdquo; and search for the connected device under &ldquo;USB Controller.&rdquo; Right-click on the device and next select &ldquo;Update driver software.&rdquo; Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the process. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><strong>Further reading: </strong><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/402858/the-best-usb-c-hubs-for-your-laptop-tablet-or-2-in-1.html\">The best USB-C hubs and dongles</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"USB-Stick\" class=\"wp-image-1980119\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/pcw08_USB-Anschluss.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><p><span> </span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If updating the connected device&rsquo;s drivers doesn&rsquo;t solve the problem, uninstall the drivers and install them again.

Every device you have plugged in consumes power and generates heat. So, to cool your home during the summer, you should consider some cheap ways to lower indoor temperatures, and ensure you&rsquo;re not using more power than necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many appliances that you think are turned &ldquo;off&rdquo; may actually be &ldquo;on&rdquo; in some capacity, sucking power and emitting heat. And when you&rsquo;re using them, they generate even more heat. In the sections below, we&rsquo;re going to offer everything from a few holistic solutions to suggestions for new devices that might identify where you&rsquo;re wasting power&mdash;lowering your power bill and keeping your house cool at the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"upgrade-your-lighting-if-you-havent-already\">Upgrade your lighting if you haven&rsquo;t already</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You probably know the basics. Unplugging as much as you can saves power, and swapping out older, inefficient appliances for newer more efficient ones can reduce heat and save money. But how much? An older 100W bulb has a surface temperature of about 200 to 250 degrees, and older readers know that the original Kenner Easy-Bake oven actually used light bulbs as a heating element. Upgrading your home to LED bulbs can save a ton in terms of power and heat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The question of how much heat appliances produce isn&rsquo;t an easy one to answer. One <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.quora.com/How-many-degrees-will-a-70-watt-light-bulb-increase-the-temperature-of-an-8x12-foot-room-in-an-hour-if-the-room-starts-at-74-degrees-Fahrenheit&amp;xcust=2-3-2009832-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">guess</a> says that a single 70W bulb can heat a room by one degree Fahrenheit; another <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.quora.com/How-much-does-a-100W-light-bulb-chan&amp;xcust=2-3-2009832-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">suggests</a> 4 degrees for a 100W bulb. But a laptop&rsquo;s power supply can range from 45W on up to 200W or so, with gaming desktops soaring into the 700W range. Displays can consume up to 200W apiece. So that should give you a ballpark of how much your gadgets are heating up your home.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"light bulb\" class=\"wp-image-2011115\" height=\"795\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/light-g2b0e86cc9_1920.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Pixabay / vickylazovich</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the more insulation you add to your home to block <em>externa</em>l heat from coming inside, the more you trap whatever heat your appliances produce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some devices are more <em>efficient</em> than others, meaning that they produce little waste heat relative to the power they consume. But very, very few of them will label their efficiency on the box, and it&rsquo;s not something that&rsquo;s usually tested. So, in general, you should assume that the more power a device consumes, the more heat it will generate. And both are bad.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-much-power-do-your-electronics-consume-find-out\">How much power do your electronics consume? Find out</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To understand the problem, buy yourself an inexpensive watt meter like the $16.99 <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Poniie-PN1500-Electricity-Electrical-Consumption/dp/B07VPTN8FZ/?tag=pcworld02-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Poniie PN1500</a>. (Kill-A-Watt is another name brand, and the $34 <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/P3-International-P4460-Electricity-Monitor/dp/B000RGF29Q/ref=sr_1_7?tag=pcworld02-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kill-A-Watt P4460</a> is both inexpensive <em>and</em> ships in multipacks.)</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Poniie Power Meter\" class=\"wp-image-2011080\" height=\"822\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Poniie-PN2500-power-monitor.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Poniie / Amazon</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Plug the meter into the wall, and the appliance or PC into the meter itself. You should instantly begin to see how much power it uses. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that many devices have both standby modes and active modes, and you&rsquo;ll want to measure both. You&rsquo;ll also want to understand how much power the PC or appliance consumes over the course of a day. A good power meter logs this information, so leave it plugged in! You can even program the meter with the rate amount your power company charges, to understand how much you&rsquo;re paying per appliance, per day. (Unfortunately, we can&rsquo;t find one that promotes &ldquo;time of day&rdquo; variations that adjusts for the peak rates some energy providers charge during high-usage periods.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our recommendation is the Poniie PN2500. With a NEMA 5-15 rating, it can actually measure the power consumed by an EV while charging. Even better (and this matters!) the PN2500 is wireless with an app you can casually monitor throughout the day. If you <em>don&rsquo;t</em> want a wireless power meter, make sure you have one with a backlight, as many outlets aren&rsquo;t placed in well-lit spaces.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"cta wp-block wp-block-button\"><a class=\"cta__btn\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C619YRRM/?tag=pcworld02-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Get the Poniie PN2500 for $49.99 at Amazon</a></p>\n\n\n<p>We&rsquo;re going to bet that your power investigations have revealed your PC as a big culprit of excess power and heat. We&rsquo;re going to attack both problems in several ways. Some of these may seem ludicrous, but again &mdash; these are presented with your comfort in mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"swap-to-a-chromebook-to-save-power-and-keep-your-office-cool\">Swap to a Chromebook to save power and keep your office cool</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a Chromebook, pull it out. A Qualcomm Snapdragon Gen 2&rsquo;s Arm processor is rated at 8W. A Core i5-1350P consumes 28W, and 64W under load. You may snicker when Arm executives brag about saving power and being more efficient, but it will all make sense when your apartment is pushing 85 degrees indoors. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Acer Chromebook Spin 315\" class=\"wp-image-2011078\" height=\"713\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Acer-Chromebook-Spin-315.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Amazon</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea of running a Web app isn&rsquo;t just for the convenience; letting Microsoft or Google&rsquo;s cloud shoulder your computing load makes sense during a massive heatwave.

So take it down a notch by <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394854/how-to-turn-on-power-mode-in-windows-11-for-increased-performance.html\">adjusting the Windows power slider</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Windows 11 Power slider\" class=\"wp-image-2011088\" height=\"739\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Windows-11-power-slider.png\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">This system, currently set for maximum (&ldquo;best&rdquo;) performance, can be dialed down to the minimal &ldquo;Recommended&rdquo; level.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Windows 10 and Windows 11 allow you to reduce the performance and power consumption of your PC by turning down the performance in the Windows Settings menu. Most Surface devices ship with the power slider turned down to its lowest setting by default, but other laptop makers don&rsquo;t. You can adjust this yourself, either via Windows Settings or the built-in utility apps that ship with your laptop, such as the Lenovo Vantage software or HP&rsquo;s Omen utility. Either way, you can cut power when you need to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you <em>do</em> own a gaming laptop, also double-check that Windows is using the less powerful, cooler integrated GPU for virtually every app. Go to <em>Settings &gt; System &gt; Display &gt; Graphics</em>, and make any adjustments to the apps listed there that you need to. Windows is probably managing each app appropriately, but you can always check. You don&rsquo;t need an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 to render a Web site.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"run-your-laptop-on-battery-to-keep-cool\">Run your laptop on battery to keep cool</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to manually adjust your laptop&rsquo;s power consumption, there&rsquo;s another way. Unplug! Your laptop will automatically shift into a lower-power mode while on battery, dimming the screen more quickly, dialing down the CPU power, and so on. This isn&rsquo;t a great solution when using an external display, but other than that, it&rsquo;s a quick-and-dirty power hack. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Windows 11 energy recommendations\" class=\"wp-image-2011087\" height=\"939\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Windows-11-energy-recommendations.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">You can apply all of Windows&rsquo; suggestions to save power and energy in a single click.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Another way to save power is to apply the new Windows 11 energy recommendations.

Unfortunately, they&rsquo;re not cheap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&rsquo;ve probably heard of external power banks or batteries. Many are designed for smartphones, providing 5 to 20 watts or so of external charging power. But an external battery designed for laptops can power your PC during the times of day when electricity costs the most. Instead of traditional external battery packs that supply 5 to 20W to charge a phone, you&rsquo;ll want one that matches the input power of your laptop&rsquo;s power supply: 60 to 90W. These aren&rsquo;t cheap, but we&rsquo;ve included our recommended model below as a solution. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"cta wp-block wp-block-button\"><a class=\"cta__btn\" href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fanker-powercore-iii-elite-25600-mah-87w-usb-c-pd-portable-charger-black%2F6433261.p%3F&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Get the Anker PowerCore III Elite 25600 for $149.99 at Best Buy</a></p>\n\n\n<p>We haven&rsquo;t talked about solar installations (as they easily cost several tens of thousands of dollars for a single-family home).

Because they&rsquo;re designed to save you money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You simply can&rsquo;t unplug your refrigerator during the day to save power. But you can unplug other devices that you truly aren&rsquo;t using &mdash; or use a smart plug to prevent them from getting any power at all. Any device left plugged in consumes some amount of standby power, with some devices using more than others to remain connected or in a sleep state to power on quickly. It&rsquo;s this &ldquo;vampire&rdquo; power we&rsquo;re attacking next.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smart plugs are the answer. Our sister site TechHive knows what <a href=\"https://www.techhive.com/article/583524/best-smart-plugs.html\">the best smart plugs to buy</a> are. Here, you have choices: do you simply want options to turn off devices when not in use? Analytics and other capabilities? Maybe. But what a smart plug simply does is replace the need to yell at your kids, your spouse, or (gulp) yourself to turn off those dang lights, <em>and</em> prevents that old TV from sucking down unnecessary electricity when not in use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We promised &ldquo;cheap&rdquo;, and this is TechHive&rsquo;s best cheap smart plug: the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.wyze.com/products/wyze-plug&amp;xcust=2-3-2009832-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wyze Plug 2-pack</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"cta wp-block wp-block-button\"><a class=\"cta__btn\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.wyze.com/products/wyze-plug/&amp;xcust=2-3-2009832-7-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Get the Wyze Plug (2-Pack) for $16.99</a></p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"other-ways-to-keep-cool-at-home\">Other ways to keep cool at home</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&rsquo;t forget about other low-tech ways to keep your house cool, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Californians know that you open your windows at night or in the morning (be safe!) to let the cool air in, then close up your windows the next morning to &ldquo;trap&rdquo; the cool air. What&rsquo;s really going on is that the objects in your home are acting as a heat sink: not radiating heat away, but storing it &mdash; or the lack of heat, more precisely. It takes more energy to cool a hot room than to keep a cool room cool. (The ocean has been a massive heat sink for decades, incidentally, as the world warms up.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One tip I use: Check the weather forecast the night before, and what the expected temperature will be and when. Set an alarm on your phone for when the temperature begins to heat up. When I wake up, I open the windows until my alarm goes off, reminding me to close the windows.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Hessaire MC18M evaporative cooler\" class=\"wp-image-2011097\" height=\"771\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hessaire-MC18M.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">An evaporative cooler is one way to cool down a house in the drier parts of the country.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Amazon</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Evaporative cooling works in a dry heat of California and Arizona, which is why you see &ldquo;spritzers&rdquo; blowing mist at restaurants and bars.

If you&rsquo;re looking for something a bit more upscale, you might try one of the evaporative cooling fans on Amazon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, if there&rsquo;s too much humidity in the air, your home or apartment may not feel as cool as it could. Removing humidity via a dehumidifier also allows your body to cool off via sweating, a cooling technique that&rsquo;s less effective if there&rsquo;s too much moisture in the air. Make sure you run your bathroom fan for a while after taking a shower, to vent the excess humidity.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"cta wp-block wp-block-button\"><a class=\"cta__btn\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Hessaire-Products-MC18M-Mobile-Evaporative/dp/B078HFGJ3T/?tag=pcworld02-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Get the Hessaire MC18M Evaporative Cooling Fan for $174 on Amazon </a></p>\n\n<p class=\"cta wp-block wp-block-button\"><a class=\"cta__btn\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/BREEZOME-Dehumidifiers-Dual-Semiconductor-Dehumidifier-Auto-Off/dp/B0BXSHJNPW/?tag=pcworld02-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Get the Breezome Dehumidifer for $49.99 on Amazon</a></p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"keep-your-home-cool-through-window-insulation\">Keep your home cool through window insulation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Windows are often a key entry point for summer heat. If you own single-pane uninsulated windows, that heat can come right through them. While you can buy expensive insulated windows, there&rsquo;s a three-pronged approach to insulating windows that you can try first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My California home has a western-facing exposure, so we&rsquo;ve had success with an exterior solar shade that&rsquo;s been treated to block as much ultraviolet light as possible. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Coolaroo Solar Shade\" class=\"wp-image-2011102\" height=\"751\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Coolaroo-solar-shade.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">A solar shade isn&rsquo;t that difficult to mount, and can provide the shade for your windows and exterior walls that a tree might normally provide.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Amazon</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>A solar shade can be attached to a wall or hung from underneath a roof overhang. It can&rsquo;t shade your roof like a tree would, but it can certainly keep your home cooler during that 3 PM-7 PM window when the afternoon sun is low in the sky, and the temperature is at its hottest. It also blocks sunlight from hitting your windows <em>and</em> walls, depending on how you&rsquo;ve mounted them. And, of course, it can be rolled up in the winter or to allow any breeze to cool your home at night.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"cta wp-block wp-block-button\"><a class=\"cta__btn\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Coolaroo-436612-Cordless-Southern-Protection/dp/B005X634VS/?tag=pcworld02-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Get the Coolaroo 6'x6' Exterior Solar Shade for $64.16 on Amazon</a></p>\n\n\n<p>Inside, you have a couple of options for keeping your home or home office cool by insulating your windows. First, you can opt for clear insulating film &mdash; this will keep your house warm in the winter and cool in the summer, providing that you have interior air conditioning. But this film won&rsquo;t reflect the sun&rsquo;s UV radiation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The clear 3M Window Insulation Kit is a popular choice on Amazon, which seals five windows. It can be applied with a hair dryer so that it clings to the window. Just think it through: once the film is applied, you won&rsquo;t be able to open the window without cutting it and/or removing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can opt for a UV blocking film, which typically is applied on the inside of the glass. This doesn&rsquo;t seem to insulate, just block UV radiation from entering your home. While the manufacturer touts the privacy aspect (people outside won&rsquo;t be able to see through your windows) this doesn&rsquo;t seem to be totally reliable.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Heat blocking film\" class=\"wp-image-2011104\" height=\"767\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Heat-blocking-film.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Xiawei&rsquo;s thermal film doesn&rsquo;t have name recognition, but it seems to do the job according to reviews.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Amazon</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Weirdly, there just don&rsquo;t seem to be many window insulating films that advertise the ability to block UV radiation <em>and</em> insulate your home, though the Xiawei film we&rsquo;ve highlighted below seems to do just that. Also note that you almost certainly won&rsquo;t be able to apply a window film over the top of the 3M kit we&rsquo;ve highlighted, so choose one or the other.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"cta wp-block wp-block-button\"><a class=\"cta__btn\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/3M-Indoor-Window-Insulator-5-Window/dp/B00002NCJI/?tag=pcworld02-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Get the 3M Window Insulator Kit for $21.88 on Amazon</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"cta wp-block wp-block-button\"><a class=\"cta__btn\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Blocking-Blackout-Protection-Reflective-Explosion-Proof/dp/B09M3RN44F/?tag=pcworld02-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Get the Xiawei Heat Control Film for $14.99 on Amazon</a></p>\n\n\n<p>Thermal shades or blackout curtains are the third option. A thermal shade can slide down over the window, but it needs to be closely fitted or else any heat it traps will just leak through the gaps. (A thermal film reflects the heat outside.) Nevertheless, a thermal shade acts like a blanket, providing additional insulation between the cool interior and the hot exterior.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"buying-an-air-conditioner-will-keep-your-house-cool\">Buying an air conditioner will keep your house cool</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, of course, there are traditional air conditioners. Many homes come with central air, but if yours doesn&rsquo;t, you may have to make some choices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One problem: Portable A/C units vent out through a window, which can complicate the window film and thermal shades we&rsquo;ve highlighted above. You&rsquo;ll have a choice between a &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; window-mounted unit, a portable model, or minisplit units that can be mounted on a wall and ducted outside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A portable A/C unit is also expensive; <em>Good Housekeeping&rsquo;s </em>value <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/appliances/g21286604/best-portable-air-conditioner/&amp;xcust=2-3-2009832-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">pick</a> for best air conditioner, the TCL 5P93C, is $298 at Walmart.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"cta wp-block wp-block-button\"><a class=\"cta__btn\" href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/321564/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;subid1=2-3-2009832-7-0-0&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/TCL-5-000-BTU-Smart-Portable-Air-Conditioner-White-W5P93/1453285040/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Ger the TCL 5,000 BTU Portable Air Conditioner for $298 at Walmart</a></p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"stay-frosty\">Stay frosty</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What we want you to take away is this: Every device in your house is fighting a war against your air conditioner. The more power they consume, the more heat they put out. The more heat they put out, the harder any existing cooling solution you have has to work. It&rsquo;s a lose-lose situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the solutions we&rsquo;ve proposed require planning and attention on your part, but many don&rsquo;t!

It&rsquo;s no easy feat to lead with a superlative like that and back it up. FastestVPN strives to be a top VPN and at least on the surface, it makes a persuasive case for itself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company is based in the Cayman Islands, which bodes well for privacy and security. The service also offers a solid premium feature set, with 10 simultaneous connections, P2P optimized servers, no logs, and stated promises to unblock region locks on most of the top streaming platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><em>Note: This review is part of our <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/3198369/best-vpn-services-apps-reviews-buying-advice.html\">best VPNs</a> roundup.

Upon first opening the application in Windows, you&rsquo;ll find a list of countries you can connect to in the main screen, making it easy to get started right away. Off to the right you&rsquo;ll find the FastestVPN trademark lightning-bolt button to connect, along with basic info about the connection (IP address and server location). In the top-right you&rsquo;ll have three buttons for the home screen, account info, and settings.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"FastestVPN\" class=\"wp-image-1485626\" height=\"493\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/settings.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"815\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><p>FastestVPN provides three protocol options and an auto option, which chooses the best of the three for your tasks.</p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">FastestVPN</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The settings screen is similar to what we&rsquo;ve seen in previous versions of the app. Here you can switch your VPN protocol between IKEv2, TCP, UDP, and Auto. The Auto protocol option is new and when chosen will theoretically give you the best protocol among the other three according to your given tasks.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>For only $40 for a lifetime plan, FastestVPN is certainly worth considering.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Below the VPN protocol options are checkboxes for things such as an <em>Internet kill switch</em> as well as options to <em>Launch at start</em>up, <em>Redial automatically if connection drops</em>, and <em>Auto connect after launch</em>&mdash;all standard fare for most modern VPN applications. The kill switch is a nice feature though and isn&rsquo;t provided by all VPN services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for servers, it&rsquo;s a little unclear how many servers FastestVPN actually has. It claims &ldquo;Servers Available in 39+ Countries and 55+ Locations,&rdquo; but we found that what servers are actually available will depend somewhat on the device and application you are using. Additionally, it has a limited number of streaming-specific servers and D-VPN (Double VPN) servers that bounce your connection through more than one server to provide double encryption.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"FastestVPN\" class=\"wp-image-1485627\" height=\"631\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Supported-Devices.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"840\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><p>FastestVPN has app support for a ton of devices.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">FastestVPN</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>FastestVPN has done a great job providing app support for a ton of devices. These range from the standards such as Windows, MacOS, iOS, and Android, to others such as Linux, Roku, and Amazon Firestick, among others. It even has browser extensions for Chrome and Firefox.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, one area that seems to be missing from all of FastestVPN&rsquo;s apps is information regarding each specific server&rsquo;s load or latency figures. This is useful if you&rsquo;re looking to connect to the fastest server in a given location, and frankly it&rsquo;s a missed opportunity in the application design. Regardless, the applications are straightforward and easy to use across all devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One other quirk we noticed was a problem with the Windows application when installing. It seems that it may not have the proper certification with Microsoft, which causes Windows Defender to flag the application and present an error message that halts the installation process. This is easy enough to bypass, but may be confusing at first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>FastestVPN also provides a few bonus features such as helpful 24/7 chat and email support, a free password manager, and up to 2TB of cloud storage.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fastestvpn-performance\">FastestVPN: Performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In our performance tests we compared the base speed of our internet to that of different server locations across the world to see how our internet speed connected to a VPN compares to our base internet speed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last time around we saw FastestVPN hitting 45 percent of the base speed in our tests averaged across all locations. At the time, that was a huge bump from the 30 percent base speeds in our initial review of the service.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This time around we didn&rsquo;t see quite the same jump, but we did notice a slight improvement of up to 49.5 percent of the base download speed when connected to FastestVPN&rsquo;s servers. Furthermore, we saw an admirable 68 percent of the base upload speed. These are solid numbers and FastestVPN&rsquo;s recent upgrade to 10Gbps+ speed servers is obviously making a difference for its users.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"FastestVPN\" class=\"wp-image-1485628\" height=\"634\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Streaming-Servers.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1021\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><p>FastestVPN has specific servers to use to unblock streaming sites.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">FastestVPN</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>FastestVPN does an alright job at getting around region locks and geo-restricted content. Using its normal servers was rather hit or miss when trying to access sites such as Netflix and Disney+. Some servers were able to bypass the region locks while many others were actively blocked and the streaming sites wouldn&rsquo;t load properly. That being said, FastestVPN (at the time of writing) has seven streaming-specific servers, which all worked just fine in our tests. The only issue here is that if you want to access content from countries other than these streaming-server locations, you may be out of luck. But just recently, FastestVPN has updated their streaming-specific servers to include more major channels including Hotstar, BBC iPlayer, and Amazon Prime, among others, so they are making strides in the right direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fastestvpn-security-and-privacy\">FastestVPN: Security and privacy</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"FastestVPN\" class=\"wp-image-1485629\" height=\"608\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Security-Features.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><p>FastestVPN security features.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Sam Singleton</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>FastestVPN&rsquo;s official business location is the Cayman Islands. This might sound kind of sketchy at first glance, but the company says that this was on purpose in order to avoid any laws requiring them to keep browsing records on its customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company&rsquo;s privacy policy states that it does not log any information about its customers. The only thing the company keeps, it says, is the email address you use to sign up for the service. In mid-2023 FastestVPN completed an independent audit by AltisIT to successfully verify their no-logs policy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The service uses the industry standard AES 256-bit encryption and comes with IPv6 and DNS leak protection. Our DNS leak tests proved that there were no IP or DNS leaks while using the VPN. This is important as IP and DNS data leaks can allow for outside parties to know your true location and watch your activity while online.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fastestvpn-final-thoughts\">FastestVPN: Final thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>FastestVPN has improved upon its service since the last time we tested it, but there are some areas that still need improvement. It&rsquo;s obvious that it doesn&rsquo;t have the same resources as some of the largest VPN services, but nonetheless it&rsquo;s still able to make the core VPN features work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite what is stated in its name, it may not be the fastest VPN, nor does it have the most robust feature set. But that&rsquo;s not the main draw anyways. The company seems to know where it stands in the marketplace and it&rsquo;s leaning heavily on privacy and cost.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It offers enough speed and security for most everyday uses, and extras such as free Cloud storage and a password manager are welcomed additions. Ultimately, it&rsquo;s the price that will appeal to most people and for only $40 for a lifetime plan, FastestVPN is certainly worth considering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Editor&rsquo;s note</em></strong><em>: Because online services are often iterative, gaining new features and performance improvements over time, this review is subject to change in order to accurately reflect the current state of the service.
