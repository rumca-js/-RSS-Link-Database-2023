You can find a quiet spot and roll with the family or join in with the official egg rolls on the hour. \n\nIt may sound wacky and exciting but that's because it is! With each year differing from the next, you never know what to expect. You are, however, guaranteed a great Easter Monday out.\n\n\nJoin as a member to support this channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8abMPJmTPmsaSc7j-lwIhQ/join\n\nMusic: Mozart, K239", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTVuihAFDe0", "date_published": "2023-08-30T06:45:35.239486+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Nineteenth century videos.
