EA’s annual football franchise might be changing its name from FIFA to EA Sports FC with its upcoming instalment, but the way of the series has always been to bring smaller, iterative improvements to its tried-and-tested formula year on year rather than introducing radical reinventions, and it seems like that will continue to be the trend with the upcoming EA Sports FC 24. 

In the lead up to the football sim’s launch, EA Sports has revealed plenty of details about what this year’s game will be improving with its on-pitch gameplay, and what sorts of changes and improvements we can expect to its variety of modes. Here, we’re going to talk about that, and how EA Sports FC 24 is going to change things up from FIFA 23 and its predecessors.

With all the hype around Starfield, it's easy to forget that this is Bethesda Game Studios' first new IP in 29 years. It's the developer's first space-faring RPG on a grand scale, with over 1000 planets to explore. You can build starships, board other ships, become a pirate, trade in illegal contraband, explore the universe and much more.

However, it's even more interesting how many incredible examples of attention to detail are available from Starfield Direct's Deep Dive from this past June and recent interviews. Whether it's your parents taking after you, holding your breath while aiming to reduce O2, or more, there is a lot to unpack, and that's before we get into the game.

Here are 20 examples of attention to detail in Starfield. It releases on September 6th for Xbox Series X/S and PC.
