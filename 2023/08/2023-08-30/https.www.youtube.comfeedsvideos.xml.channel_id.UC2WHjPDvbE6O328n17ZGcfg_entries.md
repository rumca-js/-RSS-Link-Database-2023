Last year I built an AI that shoots me in the face with a nerf gun when I get distracted, but it’s not working. I’m still finding myself getting distracted, so I figured I’d take a slightly different approach. Instead of punishing me for getting distracted, how about I redirect that towards the distractions themselves.
I'll redirect the nerf gun to target the door as a deterrent against distractions. As software engineers, we must innovate. Consider this: each sip of your morning coffee takes about 4 seconds. That's 1oz per sip, 8oz per cup, and for developers, roughly 4 cups daily. This totals 128 seconds wasted daily just sipping coffee. Introducing the coffee dispenser: a water gun that delivers an ounce of coffee straight into my mouth every 5 minutes.
This system employs artificial intelligence in the form of real-time object det
