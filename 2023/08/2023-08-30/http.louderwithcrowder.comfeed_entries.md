<p>The reason this is an "issue" is because of DeSantis supporters on X comparing DeSantis talking about the hurricane to Trump talking about himself. Which even from a political standpoint is stupid. Trump only caring about Trump isn't news, and Trump only caring about Trump DOESN'T MOVE THE POLITICAL NEEDLE

Case in point: I bet you didn't even notice we haven't sh*t on late-night hosts in a while. Or that there haven't been late-night talk shows to sh*t on. Or that Hollywood is on strike. Good for you being too busy carrying on with your life!</p><p>We hope you enjoyed it while it lasted. The five tenors of douche -- Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, Seth Meyers, John Oliver, and Jimmy Fallon -- have united for a podcast. Since the writers are on strike, they have no one to write their jokes. Which is odd, because the Democrat National Committee wrote most of them.
