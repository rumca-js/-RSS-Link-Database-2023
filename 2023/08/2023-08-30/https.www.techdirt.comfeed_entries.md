Last July,&#160;we noted how&#160;media reform activists had petitioned the FCC to revoke Fox News’ local broadcast license in Philadelphia.

The states have gone rogue. In the last year alone, at least nine states enacted internet censorship laws. And more legislators are promising to take up the cause. But these laws are directly at odds with the First Amendment’s command that the government shall not abridge the freedom of speech.&#160; Undeterred, states passed laws restricting [&#8230;]

Cops and cop tech providers like to pretend the things they use and the things they do are so black ops the public should not be allowed to discuss them with anyone, much less the defendants, judges, and juries being asked to weigh evidence and render verdicts in criminal trials. A lot of supposedly secret [&#8230;]

We need a federal anti-SLAPP law and strong state anti-SLAPP laws in all 50 states. And we need that as soon as possible. Anti-SLAPP/free speech law may not be as sexy these days as antitrust law, but, well, law shouldn’t be particularly sexy. Or involve much sex at all. Joshua Wright apparently felt otherwise.

Former T-Mobile CEO John Legere&#160;repeatedly promised in print&#160;that the Sprint merger would result in a&#160;massive&#160;surge in new jobs. In a rambling missive that took aim at deal critics predicting job losses, the charming, potty-mouthed ex-CEO proclaimed that critics were lying, and that the deal would be “job positive from day one” and every day thereafter.

I swear, with some of the trademark stories we cover, it ends up feeling like we should have Yakety Sax playing on loop in the background for the readers. That&#8217;s certainly my sense when it comes to The Day Before&#8216;s trademark struggles as of late. Where to start? Well, let&#8217;s start with the basics: is [&#8230;]
