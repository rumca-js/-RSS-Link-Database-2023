All models (save for perhaps a new SE) could ditch the notch and start using the Dynamic Island cutout that debuted in the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max. There\u2019s no word on the return of the iPhone mini, and we may have to wait until next year to see the rumored iPhone Ultra.</p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apples-iphone-15-event-is-set-for-september-12th-161028116.html\"><figure><img alt=\"TMA\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/c3008710-470e-11ee-87fd-4149c06a3e75\" style=\"height: 405px; width: 675px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Apple</div></figure></a><p>Apple may finally phase out the Lightning port with the iPhone 15, making a long-awaited switch to USB-C.

You can do that on any iPad, but the steps are different depending on the model you have. If your iPad has a home button (or not), there are a couple of tricks to remember for taking screenshots. If you have an Apple Pencil, it\u2019s easy to take a screenshot with it and quickly edit the image \u2014 and there\u2019s even a virtual home button that can help you, too.
