We don’t think so.</p><p>Furthermore, this particular moorland is a site of special scientific interest, and preventing walkers from straying off the public right of way on to vulnerable heathland is surely a good thing.

<p>Swarna Khare vows never to use online travel agents again after buying ticket for already-full plane</p><p>Like thousands of others caught up in Monday’s air traffic control chaos, Swarna Khare is more than £1,000 out of pocket. However, she claims her case has been made substantially worse after she used an online agent to buy a last-minute replacement flight from Rome back to London – only to find that it appeared to have been massively oversold, denying her boarding for a second time.</p><p>The 35-year-old pharmaceutical executive from Woking had spent a week travelling around Italy and was scheduled to fly back from Rome with British Airways at 9pm on Monday evening.

<p>Too-tight suits for men, too-high heels for women: does dressing up have to be such an ordeal?</p><p></p><p>I was wandering around York one morning last week. The clouds were low and dark and heavy with more than rain. The dog’s nose was a-twitch. My brow was furrowing deeper than usual. There was some serious tension in the air. What could it be? The city was as busy as ever but, hang on, what’s this? The pubs packed out well before midday? What for, elevenses? A smartly dressed couple passed me. He looked grave, like he might be off to a funeral, but her outfit was too colourful for mourning. And, without breaking their brisk step, she was troughing urgently on a Marks &amp; Spencer sandwich. Ah yes, of course! It was race day.</p><p>The blokes were, to a man, sporting suits worn in the manner of blokes the world over who rarely wear suits. That is, worn uncomfortably, on account of their suits’ sizing being a tribute to younger, slimmer, happier days. I sit very tightly in this

<p>Finding your way without the social template of romantic love is a tough challenge, but writers from Deborah Levy to Hanya Yanagihara offer clues to how it can be done</p><p>For most of us, the idea of romantic love has lost hardly any of its allure. It continues to be the focus of our collective fantasies. It is, perhaps, the most essential component of what most people understand happiness to be. But more people live alone now than at any other time in history. People like me. Many of us, willingly or not, have said goodbye to the grand idea of love. Even if some of us still believe in it.</p><p>But can you really live a good life alone, without a romantic relationship? How sustainable is a model like that? And how do you learn to live with being alone without it hurting, without lying to yourself? These were the questions that I didn’t know the answers to when I started writing my book, Alone. But I knew that I needed to find them. Some of the answers I found in literature – in

<p>A film about a murderous sloth rampaging through a sorority house is smarter and funnier than one might expect</p><p>The magic of cinema is in its ability to take our world, in all its messy complexity, and reflect its core truth back to us. Cinema opens our eyes. It can teach us empathy, open our eyes to wider issues. It can change us. Or it can give us a film about a killer sloth with a samurai sword, which is honestly quite a lot better.</p><p>On paper, Slotherhouse (that’s right, it’s a pun on the word “slaughterhouse”, but with sloths) has The Asylum written all over it. It has the potential to be a cheaply made, lowest common denominator Sharknadoalike; a great title and an outrageous premise that, in reality, amounts to a stunt-cast non-actor emoting in a single location for an hour to fill the gap between the three VFX shots you already saw in the trailer. Even if you actively enjoy the idea of watching a sloth murder a bunch of people, Slotherhouse still won’t be somethin

And to perform it <em>from memory</em>…? Aurora Orchestra’s conductor on recapturing the thrill of a piece once deemed unplayable</p><p>Ever since Igor Stravinsky’s ballet The Rite of Spring burst into life on a balmy Parisian evening in May 1913, it has delighted, shocked and thrilled audiences like few other works of art, rightly earning its title as <em>the </em>watershed moment in 20th-century orchestral music. Over the decades it has inspired brilliant choreographers, received many thousands of performances in concert halls around the world and been recorded nearly 200 times.

Stars of the Lid, though, made it sound like the most inviting proposition in the world.</p><p>The ambient duo of Brian McBride and Adam Wiltzie last released music together 16 years ago, yet fans loyally hung on for more. They were masters of slo-mo sublimation, able to conjure great cumulonimbuses of sound, tall and broad and imposing without a storm ever breaking out. Stars of the Lid pulsed along without drums and conveyed deep wisdom in steady gulps. That reflected, writes Wiltzie over email from his home in Brussels, his partner’s power “of emotional connection”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/30/brian-mcbride-the-stars-of-the

There will be no new property taxes or wealth tax.

But it’s not necessarily school-related stress or nerves about leaving home that is causing them to worry. It’s something more fundamental: for an increasing number of students the question troubling them is “Where am I going to live?” Student housing – a residence room, a shared house, a small flat – was once a given.

If this is indeed how South African Test cricket dies then let’s be quick about it.</p><p>Cricket’s landscape would be unrecognisable without South Africans. Not only have the Proteas provided some of the greatest exponents of the craft, but exports and expats have shaped the destinies of other nations as well.

He is also a rather stately and well-nourished figure – when his doctor asks him if he feels tired in the medical checkup scene at the beginning of this film, Maigret actually answers: “Sometimes … whe

The sophisticated Venn diagram of sexual expression that he vaguely imagines is tested to destruction by the simple reality of human feelings.</p><p>The setting is Paris; Franz Rogowski plays Tomas, a brilliant, but mercurial young director whom we see in an opening

<p>A trip focusing on slow immersion in the natural world is the perfect way to unwind and restore mental harmony for this busy mum</p><p>A railway station concourse is a stressful place. Trains come and go, announcements call out, screens flicker, lights flash and people run in different directions. Yet it was this chaotic scene that I was being asked to imagine on a mindful walking weekend in north-east Wales – one designed to help me unplug from stressful situations and learn tricks to sooth my senses in day-to-day life. I lifted my head to look at the assembled group – my friend Cerys, Nicky (who runs her own hospitality business), Claire, whose company started this tour, and Belinda Gammon, a mindfulness guide and therapist. We were high on a hill above the hamlet of Llanarmon Dyffryn Ceiriog in north Wales, where only the sound of wind-rustled leaves could be heard.</p><p>“Think of your mind as being this station,” said Belinda in a slow, soothing tone. “Your thoughts are the tra

Then she told me how much she hated it …</p><p>In 2010, the year Mark Zuckerberg said privacy was no longer a social norm, my child was born. I had no intention of doing anything online that would compromise my daughter’s privacy, but I had never been a parent before and lived 5,000 miles away from where I grew up. Social media was my lifeline, and a place to share her development with our widespread loving family. I transcribed funny and sweet verbatim dialogues between us and posted them for my inner circle. I had become a “sharent” – a parent who publishes information about their child online. What harm could it do?</p><p>While I was writing a book about digital afterlives, though, I began thinking about how our online identities are shaped from our first moments, often by other people.
