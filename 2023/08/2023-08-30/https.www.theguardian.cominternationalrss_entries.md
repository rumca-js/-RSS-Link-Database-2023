<ul><li>Tourists set record total for a T20 international at Kingsmead</li><li>Debutant Tanveer Sangha takes four for 31 in Durban</li></ul><p>Mitch Marsh produced a blistering captain’s knock and Tanveer Sangha made a dream debut as Australia crushed South Africa by a record 111 runs in the series-opening T20 match in Durban. Marsh thumped an unbeaten 92 off 49 balls and Tim David (64 off 28 balls) also joined in on the fun as Australia posted 226 for six at Kingsmead on Wednesday night.</p><p>In reply, South Africa were bowled out for 115 in 15.3 overs, with Sangha (four for 31) and Marcus Stoinis (three for 18) doing the damage.

<p>If in doubt turn to the £106.8m world champion sitting on the bench. It was the equivalent of money shouting through a megaphone when Enzo Fernández entered the fray after 65 minutes of watching Chelsea toil against the side sitting fifth in League Two. Mauricio Pochettino was in no mood to be caught out and, hard though AFC Wimbledon fought, a feisty Carabao Cup tie was only going one way once Fernández was on.</p><p>It was the Argentinian whose goal carried Chelsea into the third round, though not before Wimbledon had given them a fright by taking an early lead. The visitors were awkward, Harry Pell delivering a comically spiky performance in the middle, and Chelsea were nervy until Noni Madueke drew them level from the spot. Pochettino was a relieved man at the end, especially as. Wimbledon had chances to force penalties.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/30/chelsea-afc-wimbledon-carabao-cup-match-report">Continue reading...</a>
