Hello and welcome to, TUESDAY NEWSDAY! Your number one resource for the entire week's worth of VR news. Looks like It may actually happen. APPLE SEEMS TO FINALLY BE HITTING HARD with their headset. It's gonna cost a lot, it may be unappealing to some, but inevitably this will have a massive impact on the entire VR ecosystem. Meta also talk about their entrance into VR 2.0 with Quest 2, Quest Pro, and Quest 3. We also have some other fun projects from the NadexNade, PSVR2 PC news, and VRCHat!

hope you enjoyed!
