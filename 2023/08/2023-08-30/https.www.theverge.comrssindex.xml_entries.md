  <p id="8pCXx4">Apple employees will soon stop providing assistance to customers via X — formerly Twitter — as well as YouTube and the Apple Support Community online forum, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/30/apple-social-media-support-report/"><em>MacRumors</em> reports</a>, citing anonymous sources.</p>
<p id="xCZDrl">Apple reportedly plans on getting rid of its social media support advisor roles, including the paid community specialist role for the Apple Support Community, later this year. Over 150 employees will be affected, though <em>MacRumors </em>reports that Apple will offer these workers an opportunity to switch to a phone-based support role. </p>

  <p id="bAGNv5">The road to a world with only electric vehicles doesn’t run through the US. It runs through China. In China, nearly 30 percent of all car sales are EVs. In the US, it’s just 7 percent. How did China so thoroughly smoke the US when it comes to EVs?</p>

  <p id="ofGNmn">The Fairphone 5 is the latest sustainably produced and repairable handset from Dutch smartphone company Fairphone. Like its previous devices, the Fairphone 5 is made with ethically sourced materials by workers who are given a living wage bonus and is designed to be easy to repair with a lengthy software support period. But this year’s model is specced-out much more like a modern midrange smartphone, with an OLED display, fast 30W charging, and dual 50-megapixel cameras at the rear.</p>

  <p id="jokXlF">I thought I had malware on my main Windows 11 machine this weekend. There I was minding my own business in Chrome before tabbing back to a game and <em>wham</em> a pop-up appeared asking me to switch my default search engine to Microsoft Bing in Chrome. Stunningly, Microsoft now thinks it’s ok to shove a pop-up in my face above my apps and games just because I dare to use Chrome instead of Microsoft Edge.</p>
<p id="34iQ0v">This isn’t a normal notification, either. It didn’t appear in the notification center in Windows 11, nor is it connected to the part of Windows 11 that suggests new features to you. It’s quite literally a rogue executable file that has somehow appeared in c:\window

  <p id="lsFpjU">The Steam Deck’s biggest weakness <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23513517/steam-deck-long-term-test-valve">is battery life</a> — and yet somehow, every challenger has failed to raise that bar. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23604799/ayaneo-2-review-handheld-gaming-pc">The Ayaneo 2 showed us</a> that AMD’s Ryzen 6800U wasn’t ready to compete; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23719210/asus-rog-ally-review">the Asus ROG Ally revealed</a> that AMD’s Z1 Extreme couldn’t pull ahead if Asus insisted on matching the Steam Deck’s 40 watt-hour battery pack. </p>
