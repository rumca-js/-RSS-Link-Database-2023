<p>When Sennheiser debuted <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-23-sennheiser-ambeo-soundbar-review.html">the original Ambeo Soundbar</a> in 2019, it was the company's only living room speaker to carry its immersive audio tech. It was also very expensive at $2,500.

<p>The contactless payment system for New York City’s subways has a security hole. Anyone with access to someone’s credit card number can see when and where they entered the city’s underground transit during the last seven days. The problem lies in a “feature” on the website for OMNY, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-31-apple-pay-iphone-new-york-city-subway-mta-omny.html">tap-to-pay system for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA)</a>, which allows you to view your recent ride history using only credit card info. Further, subway entries purchased using Apple Pay — which gives merchants a virtual number instead of your real one — still somehow link to your physical credit card number.</p><p>The MTA’s loose implementation could allow stalkers, abusive exes or anyone who hacks into or purchases a person’s credit card information online to find out when and where they typically enter the subway.

<p>Garmin is launching the Venu 3 and smaller Venu 3S smartwatches today with a greater focus on sleep-tracking and personalization. In particular, it's adding a proactive sleep coaching feature and nap detection. The latter is noteworthy, considering most modern smartwatches from companies like Apple, Samsung, and Google can track your sleep, but only at night. With the Venu 3 series, you'll be able to rest easy knowing your daytime slumber can also be tracked, if that's your kind of thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The company's new sleep coach considers factors such as a user's daily activity levels, sleep history, and heart rate variability (HRV) – which is a sleep metric new to the Venu series. The coach will provide recommendations on the amount of sleep you’ll need to make it through the next day. The naps that the Venu 3 detects will also go towards replenishing energy levels as tracked by the company’s “Body Battery” tool, which quantifies energy levels on a scale of 1-100 depending

<p>If you’ve recently bought an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-ipads-how-to-pick-the-best-apple-tablet-for-you-150054066.html">iPad</a> and now use it for everything, you probably have run into a case where you’ve needed to take a screenshot. You can do that on any iPad, but the steps are different depending on the model you have. If your iPad has a home button (or not), there are a couple of tricks to remember for taking screenshots. If you have an Apple Pencil, it’s easy to take a screenshot with it and quickly edit the image — and there’s even a virtual home button that can help you, too. Here are all of the ways you can take a screenshot on an iPad.</p><h2>How to take a screenshot on an iPad without a home button</h2><p>Like the latest iPhones, most of the newest iPad models like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-mini-6th-generation-2021-review-130009170.html">iPad mini</a> don’t have a home button.

<p>Google has published a photo of the Pixel 8 Pro before it has even unveiled the device... on the day Apple announced that it was going to launch the iPhone 15 on September 12th. An account on X (formerly Twitter) called <a href="https://twitter.com/android_setting">Android Setting</a> (via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/30/23851805/google-store-pixel-8-pro-leak-porcelain"><em>The Verge</em></a>) has spotted a photo of a person holding a beige-colored phone against their ear on a <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b3JlLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vdXMvY2F0ZWdvcnkvc3Vic2NyaXB0aW9ucz9obD1lbi1VUyZwbGk9MSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOWY0M2FmNzMtOWRjMS00Yjg0LTgzODgtMzg1Y2UyOTA0NmE2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAbkdohNLwvYoKiD6YTAqZjO2T0oM4qu-0uLztDZSbFO6&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.google.com%2Fus%2Fcategory%2

## Fairphone 5 is boring… how exciting!

<p>It’s been years and years since the bleeding edge of the smartphone world was truly exciting. The industry may want us to salivate over its latest 5G, 108-megapixel, folding-screen masterpiece, but my mouth remains bone dry. To me, it’s because the ceiling of what’s possible hasn’t risen much in the last four or five years, but the floor has maintained its slow creep northward. On paper, the just-announced Fairphone 5 has the specs you’d expect from a mid-range handset. But now that’s not really a penalty since you’re also getting a modular, sustainably-made and potentially upgradeable handset built by people paid a fair(er) wage for doing so. It’s just a smartphone, like any other. On one hand, that makes the new Fairphone 5 boring, but from this perspective, <em>boring can be good</em>.</p><p>Ten years into its mission to build a “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-06-ethical-smartphone-conscious-consumption.html">better</a>” smartphone, it’s not clear if Fairphone still ne

<p>Sony has just split its small form-factor full-frame <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a-7-c-review-smart-small-clumsy-153031933.html">A7C series</a>, now offering two lower-cost versions of higher-end cameras — much as it did with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonys-12-megapixel-full-frame-zv-e1-is-a-low-light-vlogging-beast-140009036.html">ZV-E1 vlogging camera</a>. The <a href="https://pressroom.pixelshift.studio/sony-electronics-releases-two-new-alpha-7c-series-cameras">new models</a> are the 33-megapixel A7C II (based on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a7-iv-mirrorless-camera-review-163026066.html">A7 IV</a>), and the 61-megapixel A7C R, a mini-me version <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a7r-v-review-awesome-images-improved-video-unbeatable-autofocus-150058082.html">of the A7R V</a>. Both are nearly as powerful as the larger versions and offer key ergonomic updates, but lack a few features that pros may find essential.&nbsp;</p><h3>Sony A7C R</h3><
