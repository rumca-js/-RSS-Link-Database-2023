<p>If you've ever had to write a program which interfaces directly with hardware —
perhaps while writing a program for an MCU or embedded system or a kernel
driver — you may have noticed a few common patterns in register map behaviour
and design. I'm not sure anyone has ever really collected them together, so I
decided to make a list of all the ones I can think of.</p>
