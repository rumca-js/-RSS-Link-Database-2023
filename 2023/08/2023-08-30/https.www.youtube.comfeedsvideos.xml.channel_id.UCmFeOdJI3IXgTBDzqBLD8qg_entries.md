This video delves into the themes of modernity and postmodernism as reflected through the character Patrick Bateman in the film American Psycho. As a Wall Street investor employed by a major corporation, Bateman appears to be the epitome of success, yet his façade of mental stability is disintegrating. Despite his considerable wealth and investment in art and material luxuries, Bateman finds that money can't buy him contentment. This underlying tension is one reason why "Sigma Male" compilations featuring American Psycho are gaining popularity.
