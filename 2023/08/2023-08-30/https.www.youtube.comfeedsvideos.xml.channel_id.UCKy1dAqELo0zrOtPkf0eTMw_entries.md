## What's Going On With Starfield's 'Boundary Reached' Drama? - IGN Daily Fix

In today's Daily Fix:
Starfield isn't even out yet and it's already stirring up drama. Gameplay reportedly featuring a 'Boundary Reached' message is making the rounds online, causing some to accuse Bethesda of misleading the degree of exploration players will have in the game. But of course there are two sides to every story, and many have come to the games defense, suggesting skeptical players to wait until reviews are out before jumping to conclusions. In other Xbox news, the $1 Game Pass trial plan is apparently no more. We're not sure if it's temporary, or if the plan is gone for good, but considering Starfield's release later this week and that it'll launch on Game Pass on Day 1 makes this decision worthy of some eyebrow raising. And on the Nintendo side of things, the Switch has eclipsed the venerable Wii in U.S. sales, and putting it just shy of the Xbox 360's lifetime sales. Oh, and be on the lookout for a new Nintendo Direct this week!
