In other Xbox news, the $1 Game Pass trial plan is apparently no more. We're not sure if it's temporary, or if the plan is gone for good, but considering Starfield's release later this week and that it'll launch on Game Pass on Day 1 makes this decision worthy of some eyebrow raising. And on the Nintendo side of things, the Switch has eclipsed the venerable Wii in U.S. sales, and putting it just shy of the Xbox 360's lifetime sales.
