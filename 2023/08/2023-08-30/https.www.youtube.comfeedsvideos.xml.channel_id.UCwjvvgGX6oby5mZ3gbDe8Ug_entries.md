This is the power of the Zhongrong Trust crash. Wealthy Chinese of middle or even higher classes can be wiped out in two months. State-owned Zhongrong International Trust, a giant in China's trust industry, is a large seller of financial products. The assets under its management were US$108 billion by the end of 2022. The crisis is the latest alarm in the market. According to the stock exchange filings, the company recently failed to make interest and principal payments totaling $14 million to three listed Chinese companies in connection with four trust products it managed.

On the Nanjing subway, a woman was given a ticket for drinking water on the subway. When a journalist inquired about it, Subway authorities responded by saying that eating and drinking were prohibited on trains. Water is a form of drink. Once spotted, one must be fined. If passengers are thirsty, they can get off the train drink on the platform, and come back up when done. 
The crazy operation of imposing fines will undoubtedly and significantly add to the burden of running a business. Consumers suffer in the end. They have to shell out more money for spending. Fines might lead business operators to cut back on quality, or, worse, close the businesses, resulting in less supply of products and a continual rise in the unemployment rate.
