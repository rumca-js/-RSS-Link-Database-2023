Featuring interviews with many of its players, adventurers and miscreants, the documentary \u2014 made by director C.B. Stockfleth, producer Lance Bangs and executive producer Rob-Hatch Miller \u2014 doesn't so much explain Elephant 6 but defines a transparent dream. Some mysteries and myths are dispelled, but mostly, we meet the weirdos in love with warping the world. \n\nThe Elephant 6 Recording Co. documentary will receive its YouTube premiere via NPR Music on Aug. 31, 2023, and can be viewed 12 hours afterward. NPR Music producer (and Elephant 6 nerd) Lars Gotrich will moderate the chat room. At the request of the film's distributors, this video will only be available to watch in the U.S. \n\n\nFound out more about the movie:\nhttps://www.elephant6movie.com/\n\nHear the Elephant 6 Orchestra in concert:\nhttps://www.npr.org/2008/10/27/96105602/the-elephant-6-orchestra-in-concert", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2OgTac8dQE", "date_published": "2023-08-28T13:40:04.722611+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": "NPR Music", "album": "NPR Music", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/w2OgTac8dQE/hqdefault.jpg"}]
