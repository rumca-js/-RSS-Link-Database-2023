  <p id="AXLT8v">Google appears to be working on a satellite SOS feature for Google Messages that would let users text emergency services from remote areas without a conventional cell signal. As spotted by developer <a href="https://twitter.com/neil_rahmouni/status/1695959688683176166">Neïl Rahmouni</a>, early code in the Google Messages app <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-messages-satellite-messaging-garmin-3358491/">shows work</a> on an integration with Garmin and its emergency Garmin Response service. Google also appears to have <a href="https://twitter.com/neil_rahmouni/status/1692315362698654033">started work</a> on a UI for messaging emergency responders.</p>
<p id="EQnFn8">Garmin’s emergency service uses the Iridium satellite network, which Iridium says is capable of delivering a signal “anywhere on Earth.” There is a big catch, though, when it comes to using satellite SOS services from Garmin: it requires a $15 per month subscription on Garmin’s own devices. So while this would be a great...</p>

  <p id="PWPdgh">What if you could have a conversation with your notes? That question has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/25/23845590/note-taking-apps-ai-chat-distractions-notion-roam-mem-obsidian">consumed a corner of the internet recently</a>, as companies like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/21/23767248/dropbox-ai-dash-universal-search">Dropbox</a>, Box, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/16/23460904/notion-ai-notes-writing-machine-learning">Notion</a>, and others have built generative AI tools that let you interact with and create new things from the data you already have in their systems. </p>
<p id="qwrKhO">Google’s version of this is called <a href="https://notebooklm.google.com/">NotebookLM</a>. It’s an AI-powered research tool that is meant to help you organize and interact with your own notes. (Google originally <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/10/23718707/google-io-2023-project-tailwind-personal-ai-notebook">announced it earlier this year</a> as Project Tailwind but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/12/23792382/google-notebooklm-tailwind-ai-notes">quickly changed the name</a>.) Right now, it’s really just a prototype, but a small team inside the company has been trying to figure out what an AI notebook might look like.

  <p id="ylaVMI">Dolby Atmos is about to get a whole lot more adaptable. Today, Dolby is announcing Dolby Atmos FlexConnect, which it describes as “a new feature that seamlessly pairs together a TV’s sound system with accessory wireless speakers to deliver a more extensive and immersive Dolby Atmos sound experience.” Since it factors your TV speakers into the equation, FlexConnect doesn’t require a soundbar at the center of everything. TCL will become the first TV manufacturer to offer FlexConnect with its upcoming 2024 TV lineup, and it also plans to release a line of wireless speakers optimized to support the feature.</p>
<p id="cEfqvy">Dolby says that FlexConnect “intelligently optimizes the sound for any room layout and speaker setup, offering the freedom to place one...</p>
