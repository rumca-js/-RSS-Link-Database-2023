<p>Way back in 2015, Google launched <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-08-17-google-project-sunroof.html">Project Sunroof</a>, an ingenious Maps layer that combined location, sunlight and navigation data to show how much energy solar panels installed on a home’s roof might generate — it could be your house, could be your neighbor's, didn’t matter because Google mapped it out for virtually every house on the planet. This was a clever way to both help advance the company’s environmental sustainability efforts and show off the platform’s technical capabilities.</p><p>On Tuesday at the Google Cloud Next event, the company will officially unveil a suite of new sustainability APIs that leverage the company’s AI ambitions to provide developers with real-time solar potential, air quality and pollen level information. With these tools, “we can work toward our ambition to help individuals, cities, and partners collectively reduce 1 gigaton of their carbon equivalent emissions annually by 20

<p>Americans have grown more worried about AI in the last nine months. A new <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SR_23.08.28_views-of-ai_topline.pdf">survey</a> from the Pew Research Center indicates 52 percent of respondents are more concerned than excited about rising artificial intelligence use, up 14 points since December. Meanwhile, only 10 percent say they’re more excited than worried, while another 36 percent described their views as equally balanced. “Concern about AI outweighs excitement across all major demographic groups,” the Pew Research Center wrote in a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/08/28/growing-public-concern-about-the-role-of-artificial-intelligence-in-daily-life/">blog post</a> today.</p><p>It’s been an eventful nine months since the Pew Center last surveyed people about AI.

<p>In March, OpenAI sought to head off concerns that its immensely popular, albeit hallucination-prone, ChatGPT generative AI could be used to dangerously amplify political disinformation campaigns through an update to the company's <a href="https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies">Usage Policy</a> to expressly prohibit such behavior. However, an investigation by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/08/28/ai-2024-election-campaigns-disinformation-ads/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a> shows that the chatbot is still easily incited to breaking those rules, with potentially grave repercussions for the 2024 election cycle.</p><p>OpenAI's user policies specifically ban its use for political campaigning, save for use by &quot;grassroots advocacy campaigns&quot; organizations.

Today, Dolby has announced a new Atmos feature that will function similarly, pairing TV speakers with any wireless speakers you have in the room. Officially dubbed Dolby Atmos FlexConnect, the tech will debut first on 2024 TCL TVs.</p><p>Dolby explains that FlexConnect "intelligently optimizes the sound" based on the layout of the room and location of any speakers. The company says the technology will free users from the sonic limitations of room size, furniture positioning or the location power outlets. FlexConnect will allow speakers to be placed anywhere in a room and calibrate each of them to the TV speakers. This creates a customized Dolby Atmos sound profile unique to each user's home.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Dolby says setup is quick and easy as acoustic mapping is done using microphones inside the TV. Those components locate each speaker before performing the aforementioned audio calibration. The company explains that the result should be more consistent immersive sound no matter where you're sitting in the room.&nbsp;</p><p>FlexConnect isn't just boosting the center channel either. Instead, the feature is adjusting the sound for each speaker, even the ones inside the TV. If the system notices that a pair of speakers are at the front of the room, for example, it can tweak the audio so that the TV handles the bulk of the dialog and the speakers take on the rest of the front soundstage. If there are two speakers near the back of the room, the TV then handles dialog and those sounds that need to come from the front of the room.&nbsp;</p><p>One item that could play a key role with Dolby Atmos FlexConnect is interoperability. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-soundbars-ces-2023-dolby-atmos-060025755.html">Samsung's Q-Symphony</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-ht-a7000-soundbar-ht-a9-home-theater-system-140038379.html">Sony's Acoustic Center Sync</a> both require you to have a compatible soundbar and TV made by those companies. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-sc9-se6-soundbars-first-look-ces-2023-164512242.html">LG's Wow Orchestra</a> works the same way. If this new technology is open to manufacturers to integrate in their products like Dolby Atmos as a whole, it would great if users could pair a TCL TV with a Sennheiser soundbar — just as one example. As you might expect, TCL plans to debut wireless speakers to accompany its upcoming FlexConnect-compatible TVs.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/dolby-atmos-will-use-your-tv-to-expand-living-room-speaker-setups-123021095.html?src=rss

## The Morning After: ‘GTA VI’ hacker leaked game footage with a Fire TV Stick

<p>All you need to leak footage from a highly anticipated, multimillion-dollar game is an Amazon Fire TV stick and a cheap UK hotel. That massive <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rockstar-grand-theft-auto-6-leak-155755703.html"><em><ins>Grand Theft Auto VI</ins></em></a> leak came from Arion Kurtaj, a member of hacking group <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uk-police-charge-two-teens-in-connection-with-lapsus-hacking-group-case-113521533.html"><ins>Lapsus$</ins></a>. And he managed to do so while already on bail for allegedly hacking NVIDIA.</p><p>The 18-year-old infiltrated GTA creators Rockstar Games, even announcing himself as an &quot;attacker&quot; in the company's Slack channel. While on bail, he was not allowed internet access, but he circumvented that with a Fire TV Stick (as well as a newly purchased smartphone and keyboard) from a hotel, just outside Oxford, UK.</p><p>Further details of the attack became public following a seven-week trial and his being found guilty of hacking Rockstar, Revolut and Uber. A 17-year-old was also convicted but, unlike Kurtaj, is still out on bail. Lapsus$ comprises mostly teenagers from Brazil and the UK — Kurtaj and the unnamed 17-year-old are two of seven members arrested in the UK. Between 2021 and 2022, Lapsus$ also allegedly hacked Samsung, T-Mobile and Microsoft. The group’s motives seem to vary from attack to attack but appear to be a mix of financial gain through blackmail and sheer amusement.</p><p>It’s also unclear how much Lapsus$ has made from its cybercrimes. No companies have publicly admitted to paying the hackers.</p><p>– Mat Smith</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/gta-vi-hacker-leaked-footage-using-a-fire-tv-stick-in-a-budget-uk-hotel-room-121548381.html"><ins>https://www.engadget.com/gta-vi-hacker-leaked-footage-using-a-fire-tv-stick-in-a-budget-uk-hotel-room-121548381.html</ins></a></p><p>​​<em>You can get these reports delivered daily direct to your inbox. </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em>Subscribe right here!</em></a></p><p>​​</p><h3>The biggest stories you might have missed</h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/is-war-games-homeworld-3s-secret-weapon-153005414.html"><ins>Is ‘War Games’ Homeworld 3’s secret weapon?</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-cheap-phones-130017793.html"><ins>The best cheap phones for 2023</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-containing-big-tech-tom-kemp-it-rev-ai-regulation-143014628.html"><ins>Hitting the Books: Why AI needs regulation and how we can do it </ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-password-manager-134639599.html"><ins>The best password managers for 2023 </ins></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/engadget-podcast-sony-playstation-portal-123056370.html">Engadget Podcast: Is Sony’s PlayStation Portal a huge mistake?</a></h2><h3>Another PlayStation handheld?</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/engadget-podcast-sony-playstation-portal-123056370.html"><figure><img alt="TMA" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/3999d3d0-458a-11ee-80fb-696dc26234b9" style="height: 303px; width: 675px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure></a><p>This week, Sony announced the PlayStation Portal, a $200 handheld that can only stream games from your PS5.

Along with <em>Part Two</em>, <em>Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire</em> and <em>Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim</em> have been pushed back to April 12th and December 13th, 2024, respectively, largely to accommodate <em>Dune: Part Two</em>.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/dune-part-two-delayed-until-march-2024-following-writer-strikes-075730012.html"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-solar-orbiter-spacecraft-may-have-discovered-what-powers-solar-winds-114504839.html">The Solar Orbiter spacecraft may have discovered what powers solar winds</a></h2><h3>The spacecraft has imaged picoflare jets for the first time.</h3><h3></h3><p>You’ve probably heard of solar winds, but the origin of these streams of charged particles remains a mystery, even decades after their discovery. The images captured last year by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) instrument aboard ESA's and NASA's Solar Orbiter, however, may have finally given us the knowledge to explain what powers these winds. In a paper published in <em>Science</em>, a team of researchers described a large number of jets coming out of a dark region of the sun. They’re called picoflare jets because they contain around one-trillionth the energy the largest solar flares can generate. These picoflare jets reach speeds of around 100 kilometers per second, lasting between 20 and 100 seconds. The researchers believe they have the power to emit enough high-temperature plasma to be a substantial source of our system's solar winds.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-solar-orbiter-spacecraft-may-have-discovered-what-powers-solar-winds-114504839.html"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-after-gta-vi-hacker-leaked-game-footage-with-a-fire-tv-stick-111524232.html?src=rss

Basically, it's super comfortable to wear for long periods of time. The M5 also has double the number of processors and microphones devoted to noise canceling as its predecessor — noticeably blocking out most noises you'd encounter day-to-day.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The sound quality is also top-notch on the M5s, with 30mm carbon fiber drivers managing the audio and overall more depth to each song. Using the DSEE Extreme has a small impact here, too, with it barely impacting the quality of the music.

## Judge tosses Republican lawsuit against Google over Gmail spam filters

<p>Last year, the Republican National Committee (RNC) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-republican-national-committee-sues-google-over-gmail-spam-filters-173722812.html">filed a lawsuit</a> against Google accusing it of political bias over its Gmail spam filters. Now, a federal judge has dismissed that lawsuit, noting that Google was effectively protected by Section 230 of US law, and that the RNC had not &quot;sufficiently pled that Google acted in bad faith&quot; by filtering out campaign emails, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/08/24/rnc-google-lawsuit-dismissed-spam-filter/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a> has reported.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the lawsuit, Google intentionally marked &quot;<a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/10/22/rnc-lawsuit-google-spam-filter-blocks-email">millions</a>&quot; of RNC emails as spam, so the group sought reimbursement for &quot;donations it allegedly lost as a result&quot; of that. As evidence, it cited a study finding that Gmail was more likely than Yahoo and other mail systems to mark Republican emails as spam. (One of the study's authors <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/25/republicans-seized-study-proof-googles-bias-its-authors-say-it-being-misrepresented/">told the <em>Post </em>last</a> year that its findings were cherry-picked.)</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Calling the lawsuit a &quot;close case,&quot; US District Court judge Daniel Calabretta said the RNC had &quot;failed to plausibly allege its claims&quot; that Google's spam filtering was done in bad faith. Google said that the emails in questions were likely flagged as spam because of user complaints, and cited RNC domain authentication issues and frequent mailouts as other potential issues.&nbsp;</p><p>The court also decided that RNC emails could be deemed &quot;objectionable&quot; based on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-11-did-ai-kill-off-spam-and-we-just-didn-t-notice.html">CAN-SPAM Act</a>, and the fact that Google flagged them as such was covered by Section 230, which provides immunity to online platforms from civil liability based on third-party content. All that said, the judge said Republicans could still amend the lawsuit to better establish a lack of good faith by Google.&nbsp;</p><p>Interestingly, during last year's mid-term US elections, Google created a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-political-campaign-emails-spam-fec-approval-183735778.html">loophole</a> allowing political campaigns to dodge Gmail spam filters. However, the RNC <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/13/23403259/google-gmail-republicans-gop-spam-filtering-program-midterms">reportedly</a> didn't take advantage of the program. Google has since ended the experiment, following <a href="https://www.fec.gov/files/legal/aos/2022-14/202214C_01.pdf">largely negative</a> feedback from the public.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/judge-tosses-republican-lawsuit-against-google-over-gmail-spam-filters-075622648.html?src=rss
