But when she\u2019d ask him about songwriting theory or his memories of collaborators, he\u2019d deflect with a joke or a roundabout story that would put his emotion in indirect terms while still signaling the depth of his feeling. She soon found that it was more productive to discuss the ideology behind his elaborate melodies than their history or construction. \u201cWayne never liked to talk about the music,\u201d Alavi says. \u201cThat just left everything else.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/aug/28/wayne-shorter-saxophone-zero-gravity-amazon\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/aug/28/wayne-shorter-saxophone-zero-gravity-amazon", "date_published": "2023-08-28T13:45:19.743822+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": "The Guardian", "album": "The Guardian", "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Viktor Orb\u00e1n-influenced university plans outpost in London", "description": "<p>Exclusive: Branch will be part of attempts to spread Hungarian leader\u2019s populist philosophy across Europe</p><p>Attempts by Viktor Orb\u00e1n to spread his populist philosophy across Europe have reached the UK, with an outpost of a heavily Orb\u00e1n-influenced educational institute planned for London, along with significant sponsorship for groups linked to rightwing Conservatives, the Guardian has learned.</p><p>Sources have said a Hungarian cultural centre near Trafalgar Square is expected to include a branch of Mathias Corvinus Collegium (MCC), a private university sometimes likened to a madrasa for young Orb\u00e1n-sympathising scholars and future leaders.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/aug/28/viktor-orban-influenced-university-plans-outpost-in-london\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/aug/28/viktor-orban-influenced-university-plans-outpost-in-london", "date_published": "2023-08-28T13:45:19.717030+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": "The Guardian", "album": "The Guardian", "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Masala chickpeas and biryani: Rukmini Iyer\u2019s budget Indian recipes", "description": "<p>Enjoy today\u2019s thrifty dishes individually or pair them and serve up a feast: a starter or side of lemon dal, crisp chickpeas and pitta chips, and a spicy tomato and mushroom biryani</p><p>Two Indian-inspired recipes for you this week.
