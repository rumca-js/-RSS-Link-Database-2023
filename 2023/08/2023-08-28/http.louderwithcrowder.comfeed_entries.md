	We had wondered what had happened to 2022 LWC Woman of the Year Kayla Lemieux. The high school teacher trying to live his, her, and/or xir authentic life with fake Z-cup chesticles (and rock-hard nipples) in front of high school students. Kayla had been put on leave without pay over the distractions causing the school when this video went viral.

Kayla is back teaching at a new school and causing chaos there, where students now need to talk into an intercom in order to be let in.
</p><h3>What's Kayla Lemieux's story?</h3><br /><img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="321aa" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=35375684&amp;width=980" /><p>
	At the heart of the Lemieux brouhaha is the age-old question "What is a woman?" If you believe a woman is any man who says he's a woman, then Kayla is a shining example of beautiful and brave tolerant equity. If you believe a woman is born. that way, then a dude parading around kids with comically large fake titties in inappropriate and gross.

<p>One person who is, at the very least, not playing the gun control nonsense is Jacksonville Sheriff T.K. Waters. I'm sure the Left and the media (but I repeat myself) were excited to see he was the sheriff when news broke. They probably feel less so after what he said about the weapon used.</p><p>"The story is always about guns. People are bad. This guy's a bad guy. If I could take my gun off right now and I lay it on this counter, nothing will happen. It'll sit there.
