<p>Google has begun testing new features such as autocorrect, improved file search, and even adaptive charging within the latest version of Chrome OS, meaning those features will arrive on the stable versions of Chromebooks soon.</p>



<p>The new features are part of Chrome OS M116, available now <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://chromeos.betacommunity.com/releases/12&amp;xcust=2-2-2044462-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">for download</a> and testing.  </p>



<p>The new features include:</p>



<p><strong>Autocorrect</strong>: Autocorrect is now enabled by default for those apps that use English as a primary language, automatically fixing typos, spelling, and other errors. Grammar, however, is not affected.</p>



<p><strong>Improved search within the Files app</strong>: You can now search across bot

<p>Be careful what messages you read in Skype&mdash;at least when you&rsquo;re on your smartphone. A flaw in the mobile app can reveal your IP address to another person unbeknownst to you. All it takes is opening a message with a link in it. And Microsoft is apparently not prioritizing this issue as a security vulnerability.</p>

<p>Our PC storage drives won&rsquo;t last forever and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s always a good idea to use backup software to keep your data safe. The best Windows backup software can cover our butts when our primary drive finally up and dies.</p>



<p>While Apple&rsquo;s Time Machine provides users with an effective, set-it-and-forget-it recovery system, Microsoft users aren&rsquo;t so lucky. Instead, users are stuck deciding the best way to keep their data safe with a patchwork system of restore points, recovery discs, and file backups.&nbsp;Thankfully, a number of excellent third-party backup options have cropped up in recent years to help solve the woes of Windows users. </p>



<p>Below you&rsquo;ll find a list of our favorites, which come with easy-to-use and attractive designs as well as a full range of file and image backup capabilities. We&rsquo;ve even in

<p>As soon as you switch Game Mode on, the behavior of the operating system changes. Windows update no longer performs installations of new drivers, and Windows no longer notifies you of upcoming necessary restarts. In addition, any running games are treated with higher priority by the CPU and GPU, and Windows reduces the resources for processes running in the background. </p>

Apparently, AMD&rsquo;s Radeon graphics division is done with the RDNA 3 platform <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1431755/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-radeon-rx-7900-xt-review-rdna-3.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">just eight months after introducing it</a>.

<p>The lifespan of data on a USB flash drive depends on many factors: Under ideal conditions, data should remain preserved on a high-quality USB stick for at least 10 years or even longer. But what exactly does that mean and under what conditions does this hold true? </p>



<p>USB sticks or flash drives store data using NAND flash memory, in the form of binary valuesd (zeros and ones) in memory cells. Interestingly, it is electrons trapped in a kind of &ldquo;floating gate&rdquo; that represent these values. But these electrons can &ldquo;leak&rdquo; over time. This causes the data to degrade because it becomes harder to read whether the charge state represents a one or a zero. </p>

<p>Buying a new graphics card is usually a big investment. For this reason, you should think carefully in advance about which GPU is right for you. Here are seven mistakes you should avoid when buying a graphics card. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="1-is-the-graphics-card-the-limiting-factor-at-all">1. Is the graphics card the limiting factor at all?</h2>



<p>If your PC does not deliver the desired performance in applications or games, the graphics card does not necessarily have to be the limiting factor. The processor, the main memory, or insufficient cooling can also slow down your PC. In those cases, installing a stronger GPU will only give you a small increase in performance, if any at all. So before you decide to buy a new graphics card, you should first check whether the GPU is actually the problem. We explain how you should proceed in this article: <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1955495/pc-bottlenecks-cpu-or-cpu-limiting-gaming-performance.html">How can I tell if the CPU or GPU is limiting my gaming?</a></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="2-is-a-new-graphics-card-worth-it-at-all-or-should-i-buy-a-new-pc">2. Is a new graphics card worth it at all or should I buy a new PC?</h2>



<p>Once you have identified the graphics card as a weak point, the next question is whether an upgrade makes sense at all or whether buying a new PC makes more sense. Ultimately, this depends heavily on whether you can simply replace the graphics card or whether you will then also need a stronger power supply unit and/or a larger housing. You can find out which compatibilities you need to consider in the next paragraph.</p>

</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="3-pay-attention-to-compatibility">3. Pay attention to compatibility</h2>



<p>In order to be able to install the graphics card of your choice in your PC, a few conditions must be met:</p>



<ul>
<li>Does your power supply deliver sufficient power and have the necessary power connections? To answer this question, you need to compare the graphics card manufacturer&rsquo;s recommendation with the nominal values of your power supply unit. Unfortunately, it is not usually possible to read out which power supply unit is installed in your PC via software; you have to unscrew the PC and look. Before you do this, you must ground yourself &mdash; e.g. on a radiator &mdash; and disconnect the PC from the power supply. Then remove the rear side panel of the PC case and locate the power supply unit &mdash; usually at the back, installed at the bottom of the case. As a rule, there is writing or a sticker on the side of the power supply unit that indicates the specific model. Using the name, you can find the desired information on the manufacturer&rsquo;s website. </li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Is there enough space in the case for the graphics card? If there is not enough space in your PC case, you may not be able to install the graphics card you want. For this reason, you should definitely check before buying. If you know the model designation of your enclosure or even have the manual at hand, it is easy to find out from the manufacturer&rsquo;s specifications. You will have to check the maximum possible length and height for installing a graphics card in your enclosure against the GPU manufacturer&rsquo;s specifications for the dimensions of its product. If you don&rsquo;t know which PC case you have, you can always measure it yourself.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>The third point is optional, but it will affect the performance of the graphics card in your PC. You should also check which PCIe generation your processor and motherboard support. Although PCIe is backwards compatible, which means that you can also use a graphics card with PCIe 4.0 in a PCIe 3.0 slot, this will result in performance losses.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Last but not least, you should consider whether the desired graphics card even provides the appropriate connections for your monitor. The most common standards today are HDMI, DisplayPort, and USB-C. For older connections such as DVI or VGA, you will have to resort to adapters. But that&rsquo;s not all, because there are also differences in the HDMI and DisplayPort standards: <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/457147/hdmi-vs-displayport-which-display-interface-reigns-supreme.html">HDMI vs. DisplayPort: Which display interface reigns supreme?</a></li>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="4-the-right-graphics-card-for-the-purpose">4. The right graphics card for the purpose</h2>



<p>If you know exactly what you want to do with the graphics card and how much performance you need, you can save a lot of money. For example, a dedicated graphics card is not necessary for everyday office tasks, surfing the internet, streaming content, or simple browser games. The graphics unit integrated in many CPUs is perfectly adequate for this. </p>



<p>If you are a casual gamer or want to edit a video now and then, you can&rsquo;t avoid a dedicated graphics card, but you probably don&rsquo;t need a top model. If, on the other hand, you own a 1440p or UHD monitor with 144Hz or even more and also want to play the latest games with the best possible details or you regularly edit 8K videos or create complex 3D renderings, then a top model is the right choice for you. Our graphics card comparison will help you make the right choice:</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="5-how-much-video-memory">5. How much video memory?</h2>



<p>The topic &ldquo;size of the video memory&rdquo; also depends strongly on your field of application. However, you should not make the mistake of evaluating a graphics card solely on the basis of the size of the VRAM. As a rule, a larger video memory is an indication of better performance, but you should also take into account the memory bandwidth, the number of computing units, the clock rates, and the feature set. The current entry-level graphics cards from AMD and Nvidia offer 8GB of video memory on a 128-bit memory interface.</p>



<p>This is sufficient for casual gamers who do not always need to play with the best possible graphics settings. The entry-level models are more problematic for creative users, as the comparatively small memory interface limits the memory bandwidth. Depending on the applications, you may be better off with a graphics card of the previous generation because of the 256-bit interface, even if these cards are also equipped with only 8GB of video memory. </p>



<p>If, on the other hand, you want to play the latest games with the highest possible settings and activated ray tracing, then we have to advise against graphics cards with 8GB video memory, even when gaming in 1080p resolution. In our experience, this size is no longer sufficient in more and more games; we recommend 10 to 12GB VRAM instead. In 1440p resolution, this is again our minimum recommendation; you are better equipped for the future with 16GB. This amount is usually sufficient for 4K gaming at the moment, but more VRAM can&rsquo;t hurt for upcoming games. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="6-efficiency-is-reflected-in-the-electricity-bill">6. Efficiency is reflected in the electricity bill</h2>



<p>Especially in times of rising electricity prices and global warming, you should consider power consumption and the resulting efficiency when buying a graphics card. If you play a lot of games on your PC or often use the GPU to full capacity with creative applications, this can show up on your electricity bill at the end of the year. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="7-if-you-buy-cheap-you-buy-twice">7. If you buy cheap, you buy twice</h2>



<p>The old adage &ldquo;if you buy cheap, you buy twice&rdquo; also applies to a certain extent to the purchase of a new graphics card. Not because cheap graphics cards break quickly, but because you may find out after a short time that you would have been better off buying a more powerful graphics card. So when buying a new graphics card, always consider its future viability, if your wallet allows it. </p>

<p>If your PC is too weak for the newly purchased game and you decide to buy a new graphics card that only meets the minimum requirements, you must firstly reckon with the fact that it will only be enough for the lowest graphics settings. Secondly, it can happen that only a short time later another game comes on the market that you absolutely want to play and that has even higher requirements, in which case you will have to upgrade again. So it&rsquo;s never wrong to plan for a little buffer in the GPU&rsquo;s computing power.</p>

<p>The MSI Prestige 16 Studio is another entry in the popular 16-inch, 16:10 laptop category geared either toward content creators or gamers. With a high-resolution, miniLED panel, the Prestige 16 Studio is positioned toward the former, but a low-wattage RTX 4060 GPU and the lack of RGB lighting are the only deterrence to gamers looking to make use of this reasonably priced, highly capable laptop.</p>



<p>Priced at $2,000, our Prestige 16 Studio test system boasts a loaded component lineup with an Intel Core i7-13700H CPU and RTX 4060 graphics alongside an ample RAM and SSD capacity. The roomy miniLED display with its QHD+ resolution offers ample workspace, and the 165Hz refresh rate delivers smooth visuals for both video editors and gamers. Competing 16-inch models such as the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1525530/samsung-galaxy-book3-ultra-review.html">Samsung Galaxy Book3 Ultra</a> or <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/697179/asus-vivobook-pro-16x-oled-review-a-practical-creator-laptop-with-a-brilliant-display.html">Asus VivoBook Pro 16X OLED</a> offer OLED display and superior build quality, however, while a more gaming-focused model such as the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2022733/acer-predator-helios-neo-16-review-low-cost-but-with-all-the-frills.html">Acer Predator Helios Neo 16</a> delivers a full-wattage RTX GPU and faster frame rates.</p>

</ul>



<p>MSI sells two configurations of the Prestige 16 Studio. The entry-level model costs $1,899.99 (currently <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://us-store.msi.com/Prestige-16Studio-A13VE-040US&amp;xcust=2-1-2037298-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">on sale for $1,799.99 at MSI</a>) and features a Core i7-13700H processor, 32GB of RAM, RTX 4050 graphics and a 1TB SSD. Our test model costs $100 more and upgrades the GPU to a RTX 4060 and doubles the SSD capacity to 2TB. Both models feature a 16-inch miniLED panel with a 16:10 aspect ratio, 2560&times;1600 resolution and a 165Hz refresh rate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One note on the RTX 4060 GPU: it&rsquo;s set to run at 55 watts, which is a fraction of the graphic processor&rsquo;s maximum TGP of 140 watts. The relatively thin-and-light enclosure of the Prestige 16 Studio is the likely cause for dialing back the wattage of the GPU as an effort to keep thermals in check. Our test system&rsquo;s cooling fans frequently spun during intensive graphics loads. It&rsquo;s one of the noisier laptops I&rsquo;ve tested this year. And I felt the cooling fans could have done even more because the system quickly got hot when engaged in media editing and gaming.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="msi-prestige-16-studio-subdued-silver-design">MSI Prestige 16 Studio: Subdued, silver design</h2>



<p>The Prestige 16 Studio features an unstated design. It&rsquo;s a plain slab of silver aluminum with black keys and minimal branding. Its look has none of the flash of a gaming laptop. There&rsquo;s no sculpted vents or aggressive angles, although the back corners are tapered somewhat. Despite its all-metal enclosure, there&rsquo;s some flex to the Prestige 16 Studio&rsquo;s keyboard deck and lid. It doesn&rsquo;t feel as solid as other large aluminum laptops such as the Dell XPS 17 or HP Envy 16.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI Prestige Studio lid" class="wp-image-2037338" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MSI-Prestige-16-Studio-lid.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p>The one (only?) benefit of having a slightly less rigid chassis is a lighter travel weight. The Prestige 16 Studio weighs 4.7 pounds, which is lighter than the average 16-inch 16:10 laptop. By comparison, the HP Envy 16 weighs five pounds and the Acer Predator Helios Neo 16 is a full pound heavier at 5.7 pounds. Still, it&rsquo;s not the lightest 16-inch 16:10 laptop we&rsquo;ve tested. The Samsung Galaxy Book3 Ultra weighs only four pounds and the Asus VivoBook Pro 16X OLED weighs 4.3 pounds.</p>



<p>When you open the Prestige 16 Studio, the bottom edge of the display lifts the back edge of the keyboard deck up a bit. This not only helps with airflow but also creates a slight angle to make typing a bit more comfortable. The keys offer shallow travel with a soft feel &mdash; but with enough snappiness to provide the requisite tactile feedback to allow for speedy touch typing.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI Studio Prestige keyboard" class="wp-image-2037340" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MSI-Prestige-16-Studio-keyboard.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p>MSI squeezes in a narrow number pad of questionable value. One key is shortened to accommodate the numpad, but it&rsquo;s a big one &mdash; the right Shift key. That&rsquo;s a key I use with great regularity, and it took me some time to get accustomed to hitting the shortened Shift key with my right pinky finger. I&rsquo;d prefer to have the keyboard centered below the display. Since this RTX-based system is overkill for most number crunchers, I doubt many would-be Prestige 16 Studio owners would make much use of the numpad.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI Prestige Studio numpad" class="wp-image-2037341" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MSI-Prestige-16-Studio-numpad.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p>The keyboard offers three-level backlighting so you can dial in the LEDs to your exact specifications based on the ambient light, from a dim back office to a pitch black airplane cabin on a redeye flight. Gamers looking for a midrange gaming laptop will be disappointed to learn that the backlights are white with no option to customize the look of the Prestige 16 Studio with RGB lighting.</p>



<p>The touchpad is roomy and centered on the keyboard deck and not below the keyboard minus the numpad. I was initially worried that my right palm resting on the touchpad would accidentally move the cursor, but my fears were unfounded. The touchpad has excellent palm rejection, and the cursor stayed put as I typed.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="msi-prestige-16-studio-big-screen-miniled">MSI Prestige 16 Studio: Big-screen miniLED</h2>



<p>With a tall 16:10 aspect ratio and fine QHD+ resolution, the 16-inch display provides a large workspace. It really feels roomy. It&rsquo;s also a miniLED panel that is extremely bright. In SDR mode, it reached a peak brightness of 460 nits, and it hit 700 nits&nbsp;in HDR mode. Images and text looked crisp, and colors appeared accurate. Black levels looked good but not quite to the inky degree you&rsquo;d get with an OLED panel. And with the 165Hz refresh rate, videos and games showed smooth movement.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI Prestige Studio display" class="wp-image-2037345" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MSI-Prestige-16-Studio-display.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p>The webcam above the display has a 1080p sensor, but its image was so grainy I was convinced it was a 720p camera. On the positive, the Prestige 16 Studio has a kill switch on its left edge that cuts the power to the camera so you can protect your privacy when you aren&rsquo;t using the webcam. The camera offers IR capability so you can use facial recognition for easy, secure logins. And if you&rsquo;d prefer to use your finger for such things, there&rsquo;s a fingerprint reader to the right of the touchpad.</p>



<p>With its big and bright display, the Prestige 16 Studio could hold some appeal as an entertainment laptop, but sadly its weak stereo speakers less its appeal in this regard. The two downward firing speakers get loud enough to fill a small room, but you begin to lose clarity at around 75 percent of maximum volume. And even at less than full volume, they sound tinny with no bass response and muddied high and mid tones.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI Prestige Studio ports" class="wp-image-2037346" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MSI-Prestige-16-Studio-ports.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p>The Prestige 16 Studio offers both USB Type-A and Type-C ports, but the two USB-C ports lack Thunderbolt 4 support. They are USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 ports with a 20Gbps transfer speed &mdash; half that of Thunderbolt 4. In a nod for content creators, the laptop offers a microSD card slot.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="msi-prestige-16-studio-performance">MSI Prestige 16 Studio: Performance</h2>



<p>Our MSI Prestige 16 Studio&nbsp; test system features a Core i7-13700H CPU and GeForce RTX 4060 graphics along with a generous 32GB of RAM and a spacious 2TB SSD. The Core i7 processor is a member of Intel&rsquo;s high-performance, 45-watt H series. It features Intel&rsquo;s hybrid architecture with performance and efficiency cores; it has six performance cores, eight efficiency cores, and a total of 20 processing threads.&nbsp;The RTX 4060 is a midrange GPU in Nvidia&rsquo;s latest GeForce 40 series. As mentioned earlier, it&rsquo;s set to run at 55 watts to keep thermals in check inside the Prestige 16 Studio&rsquo;s thin enclosure. By comparison, the gaming-focused Acer Predator Helios Neo 16 features an RTX 4060 GPU running at its maximum of 140 watts.<br /></p>



<p>The Prestige 16 Studio got off to a steady start in testing. On PCMark 10, it posted a score in the mid-7,000s that was right in line with other laptops with the same CPU. Basic office apps and multitasking are easily handled by the&nbsp;Prestige 16 Studio.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="MSI Prestige Studio PCMark 10 results" class="wp-image-2037350" height="619" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MSI-Prestige-16-Studio-PCMark.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="898" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p>Our HandBrake benchmark tests how a laptop is able to handle crushing CPU loads over a lengthy period&mdash;in this case, transcoding a 30GB MKV file to a format suitable for Android tablets using HandBrake, the free video encoding utility. The Prestige 16 Studio turned in a disappointing HandBrake result, taking longer to complete the transcoding task than all but the Dell XPS 17.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="MSI Studio Prestige Handbrake results" class="wp-image-2037351" height="601" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MSI-Prestige-16-Studio.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="906" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p>Next up is Cinebench, another CPU-intensive test but one that renders a complex 2D scene over a short period of time. The Prestige 16 Studio did a bit better on Cinebench than it did on HandBrake but was still a significant amount behind two competing laptops from Acer and MSI with the same CPU.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="MSI Prestige Studio Cinebench results" class="wp-image-2037352" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MSI-Prestige-16-Studio-Cinebench.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="905" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="msi-prestige-16-studio-graphics-performance">MSI Prestige 16 Studio: Graphics performance</h2>



<p>On our graphics and gaming tests, you&rsquo;ll be able to see the performance the Prestige 16 Studio gives up by using a lower-wattage RTX 4060 GPU. On 3DMark&rsquo;s Time Spy test, the Prestige 16 Studio trailed the Acer and MSI laptops that feature full-throttle RTX 4060 graphics. It was able to top the Dell XPS 15, but its RTX 4070 GPU runs at only 40 watts.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="MSI Prestige Studio 3DMark results" class="wp-image-2037357" height="601" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MSI-Prestige-16-Studio-3DMark.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="905" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p>On our real-world game benchmarks, the Prestige 16 Studio posted a playable framerate on Shadow of the Tomb Raider but not on the more demanding Metro Exodus test. It bested the Dell XPS 15 and its low-wattage RTX 4070 GPU but trailed the gaming laptops full-wattage GPUs on both of our gaming tests.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="MSI Prestige Studio Shadow of the Tomb Raider results" class="wp-image-2037359" height="619" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MSI-Prestige-16-Studio-SoTR.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="899" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>

<p>To test a laptop&rsquo;s battery life, we loop a 4K video using Windows 11&rsquo;s Movies &amp; TV app, with the laptop set to Airplane mode and earbuds plugged in. We set the screen brightness at a relatively bright 250 nits to 260 nits, which is a good brightness for watching a movie in an office with the lights on. The Prestige 16 Studio lasted more than 8 hours, which is average for its size and component lineup based on a high-powered Intel H-series CPU and not the more efficient U-series chip.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="MSI Prestige Studio battery life results" class="wp-image-2037361" height="619" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MSI-Prestige-16-Studio-battery-test.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="898" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="msi-prestige-16-studio-should-you-buy-it">MSI Prestige 16 Studio: Should you buy it?</h2>



<p>The MSI Prestige 16 Studio is a great pick for content creators looking for a low-cost, large-screen laptop. Its miniLED panel is impressively bright for creating and editing HDR content, and the 16-inch 16:10 size offers a large canvas on which to work. You&rsquo;ll need to accept a less-than-stellar build quality, however, and be okay with slower data transfers with the lack of Thunderbolt 4 support. And you&rsquo;ll want to keep a pair of headphones handy because A. the speakers are pretty terrible and B. the laptop gets loud under load.&nbsp;</p>
