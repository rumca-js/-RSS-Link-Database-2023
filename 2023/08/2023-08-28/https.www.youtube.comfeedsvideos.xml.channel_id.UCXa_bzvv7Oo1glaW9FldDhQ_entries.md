Sprawl is a first-person shooter set in a dystopian future. The game features fast-paced action, parkour, and a retro-inspired art style that makes use of low-resolution textures in conjunction with modern rendering and lighting techniques that give it a unique look. When it comes to its core gameplay, however, Sprawl isn’t looking to reinvent the wheel, and is instead happier refining the classic mechanics we know and love.

The story revolves around disgraced super-powered agent SEVEN, who is trying to survive against a number of different government factions that are trying to kill her. SEVEN is essentially tasked with just killing her way through countless enemies. The story doesn’t really do much more than give you an excuse to kill, but when it comes to a retro FPS, an excuse is all you really need.

Mortal Kombat 1 is perhaps the biggest title in the series, and it's starting with a clean slate by rebooting the universe. Existing characters have new relationships, and though touted as a world of peace, there are still plenty of bloody battles to experience.

With all the unique mechanics that Mortal Kombat 11 offers, it's interesting to see what Mortal Kombat 1 is doing differently. The movement has become faster, and the new Kameo Fighter system allows for tagging separate characters with unique moves. What else is changing, especially all these years later?

Mortal Kombat 1 launches on September 19th for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC. Let's examine several differences from its predecessor, including the upcoming DLC characters.

A massive, sprawling open world is pretty much a guarantee in any Bethesda Game Studios RPG, and Starfield is taking that guarantee to heart, in a way that no previous BGS game has done. The Settled Systems are promising to be a vast playfield full of things to do, systems to play around with, and content to get lost in, exhibiting a variety not only in what you will see, but also what you’ll be doing across its endless expanses. 

In the lead up to Starfield’s launch, BGS has revealed and spoken about a few key locations that players will be exploring in the game, and here, we’re going to take a look at those locations, their stories, and what we can expect from them when Starfield is finally in our hands.
