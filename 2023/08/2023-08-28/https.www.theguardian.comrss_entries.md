<p>Protesters arrested after blocking route to festival, leading to fiery exchanges and threats</p><p>The road into Burning Man is a rural, two-lane highway winding through north-west Nevada. Approximately 80,000 people make an annual pilgrimage to the beloved bacchanal, many hauling trailers and RVs across miles of scorching desert in order to make it to their fabled Gomorrah. This year, however, climate activists temporarily halted the influx of eager festivalgoers, blocking the road with a 28-foot trailer and causing a bumper-to-bumper traffic jam for over an hour. They clashed with outraged Burning Man attendees as well as Nevada rangers.</p><p>In recent years, Burning Man has drifted from its hippy roots and become better known for luxury RVs, wild orgies, and Silicon Valley bros. Protestors from the Seven Circles –a coalition of activists representing the climate groups Extinction Rebellion, Rave Revolution, and Scientist Rebellion – demanded that Burning Man ban private jets and

The action picks up precisely where we left off at the end of the second series, namely a snogging sesh in the middle of a big pond, as Matafeo’s Jessie finally gets (back) together with her on-off love interest, film star Tom Kapoor, with whom she had a one-night stand in the show’s first episode. Cue a pacy montage charting the giddy highs, then inescapable lows, of their relationship, before Tom walks out of their shared home for good.</p><p>When we rejoin her two years later, Jessie seems largely over it. But Tom’s departure has had an existential impact on the show itself: surely we must now also wave goodbye to the titular conceit – whether t

Few of their objects were made for them but rather to be owned, used, enjoyed and traded.

We were told that this would scare off the mother when she was doing the rounds of offspring she had left at various spots in the fields.

<p>Three siblings return to the home in the forest where their father was murdered with an axe and their mother disappeared</p><p>A Scandi entry in the cabin-in-the-woods horror subgenre, Joonas Pajunen and Max Seeck’s feature debut starts out in rather familiar territory. Years after a gruesome tragedy where their father is bludgeoned with an axe and their mother disappears, three siblings return to the site of the crime: their childhood home nestled in the depths of a mysterious forest.</p><p>For much of its slow-burn running time, The Knocking ploughs the furrow of the reductive trauma plot that has weighed down many contemporary horror films. The tense reunion stirs up past secrets and resentments, and the characters are defined less by memorable traits than merely by revelations of the abuse they endured as children. The visuals are pretty much forgettable also, with overuse of that one stylistic device familiar from a litany of scary movies: an aerial drone shot of a car speeding

<p>World champion’s victory in F1 Dutch Grand Prix should stand as a memorable step in his inevitable successful title defence</p><p>Lewis Hamilton is adamant he dwells little on the past, his recollection of myriad victories and record-breaking moments indistinct and uncertain such is his forward focus. After the Dutch Grand Prix at the weekend Max Verstappen, who shares a champion’s trait in relentlessly anticipating the next challenge, will nonetheless surely have reason to indulge in a pleasing reminiscence of this race when the twilight years beckon.</p><p>As the wins tick over for Verstappen – 46 and counting – h<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/27/max-verstappen-wins-dutch-f1-gp-to-delight-of-orange-army">is victory in Zandvoort </a>was a celebration writ large in vivid orange.

<p>First it was culture warriors moaning about cappuccinos; now it’s a top Tory knocking Notting Hill carnival. For the sake of the whole of Britain, can we please change the subject?</p><p>A lot of the opening moves in the culture war were predicated on the idea that normal people hate Londoners. There were suddenly so many new words for us, all of them pejorative, often for puzzling reasons you could only really understand with your gut: “metropolitan elites”; “experts”; “cappuccino-drinkers” which later became “latte-sippers”; “north London lawyers”, in which the city itself had helpfully been rolled into the insult; “Westminster bubble”, which pretended to slate politicians but atmospherically tainted anyone at all proximal to Westminster.</p><p>The capital was a byword for inauthenticity, a natural habitat for the wealthy and the remote.

Such a show would have been unthinkable when Leeds (and its older counterpart, Reading) were steadfastly rock festivals, but the event has transformed to suit an ever-younger audience in bucket hats and zany outfits, here for a post-GCSE blowout and traditional rite of passage.</p><p>With genres from pop to rap to dance well represented, this year’s hits range from Wet Leg’s Krautrock-informed indie anthems to Belfast electronic duo Bicep’s beautifully visually enhanced techno.

## ‘How a man grew to greatness’: the incredible story of saxophonist Wayne Shorter

<p>In a new Amazon docuseries, executive-produced by Brad Pitt, the late music legend tells his story of triumph and tragedy</p><p>Dorsay Alavi met the saxophone virtuoso and composer Wayne Shorter in 1995, when she was hired by Verve Records to direct a video in support of his album High Life. So began a three-decade friendship that continued to blossom as she and her camera followed him on a 2002 concert tour, with “many conversations over the years”. But when she decided to make him the subject of a more intimately personal documentary – which premiered over the weekend on Amazon Prime as the three-part Wayne Shorter: Zero Gravity – she encountered a simple yet daunting stumbling block.</p><p>“It required some finesse to talk with him, especially with direct questions about musicians in the past or the tragedies of his life,” she tells the Guardian via Zoom from Los Angeles. “I had to prepare myself for Wayne to evade those questions, but there was a level of trust there … It never went how I thought it was going to go.” She describes Shorter as a “very generous” chatterbox motivated by genuine interest, all too happy to get the life story of takeout delivery drivers and telemarketers. But when she’d ask him about songwriting theory or his memories of collaborators, he’d deflect with a joke or a roundabout story that would put his emotion in indirect terms while still signaling the depth of his feeling. She soon found that it was more productive to discuss the ideology behind his elaborate melodies than their history or construction. “Wayne never liked to talk about the music,” Alavi says. “That just left everything else.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/aug/28/wayne-shorter-saxophone-zero-gravity-amazon">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Two brothers drive to Alaska to sell a haul of stolen drugs and gain a higher price – if they don’t neck them all on the way</p><p>There are definitely irksome components in this microbudget drama set largely inside a creaking Cadillac, but there are redeeming features as well. In the debit column, there are way too many vaguely admiring montages that show the sibling central characters Jake (Scott Monahan, also the film’s director and producer) and John (Dakota Loesch, also the film’s screenwriter) ingesting a pharmacopeia of drugs, from “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxycodone">roxy</a>” to heroin. Likewise, a lot of the naturalistic dialogue is a tad repetitive, like the long debates over whether they should sell all the drugs they have stolen (currently hidden in teddy bears in the trunk of the Caddy) in Los Angeles or Anchorage, Alaska. In the latter city, their illicit haul would fetch a much higher price – but only if they don’t neck it all first on the way.</p><p>A lot rides on whether viewers can find these two crazy, mixed-up twentysomething kids interesting or sympathetic enough to make it worth riding along with them for a journey that takes a very wrong turn two-thirds of the way in. A passing reminiscence about their late mother “towards the end” when she always wore a headscarf, suggests post-traumatic grief nibbling away at their psyches in the background, but does that really excuse both men’s tendency towards sudden, pointless violence?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/28/anchorage-review-drug-fuelled-roadtrip-takes-a-very-wrong-turn">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From tedious blind dates to dud clinical trials, the right kind of failure always helps</p><p>You’ve probably heard the cheerful quotes: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/winston-churchill" title="">Winston Churchill</a>, with his “success is stumbling from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm”, or CS Lewis, who wrote “failures are finger posts on the road to achievement”. What about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/billie-jean-king" title="">Billie Jean King,</a> who enthused “losing a tennis match isn’t failure, it’s research”? Maybe you find yourself thinking, “Sure. Easy to say when you’re famous and successful.”</p><p>For most people, failure is pretty simple: it’s bad, even shameful. Life is going well if you’re <em>not</em> experiencing failures, and we think that avoiding failure is obviously the right goal. We worry about what it says about us when we get something wrong (we’re not good enough!). The social stigma of failure exacerbates that spontaneous reaction.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/28/the-big-idea-why-we-need-to-learn-to-fail-better">Continue reading...</a>

There have been highs – after a tentative return last year, most people feel the fringe has found its feet again and audiences are back in bigger numbers.

They sold out their namesake variety night, while two of their acts, Jordan Gray and Emily Wilson, received glowing reviews and Edinburgh comedy award nominations. This year, the group built on that momentum, bringing 17 shows, including Edinburgh comedy award nominee <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/22/martin-urbano-apology-comeback-tour-review-a-hilariously-gross-web-of-confusing-characters">Martin Urbano</a>, and are likely to have sold out 11 of those.

Speaking with writer Matthew Polly for his definitive 2018 biography, Robert continued: “Bruce was like a wild horse that had been tied up.”</p><p>This quote doubles as a perfect description for the dazzling way in which Lee – who died 50 years ago at 32 from cerebral oedema – fought on-screen. A demonic whirlwind of flying kicks, vengeful, air-popping nunchucks, feral animal noises (something Lee invented to unsettle his opponents) and double-fisted punches that hit enemies with the elegance of a championship fencer, Lee cemented martial arts in the global mainstream. And despite his short life, he smashed through the barrier that previously held back so many Asian actors in Hollywood.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/aug/28/they-should-be-called-bruce-em-ups-how-bruce-lee-shaped-fighting-games">Continue reading...</a>

The punk frontman sits alone in the cluttered makeshift studio in the basement of his Los Angeles home, hunched over his desk in sandals and an obnoxiously bright green tank top, his face glued to his computer monitor. There’s a neon sign on the wall behind him that reads: “It’s 420 Somewhere.” He replays the same 15 seconds of audio over and over, clicking his mouse around to fiddle with various levels and sounds, making imperceptibly tiny tweaks. Hours pass like this. Every once in a while he breaks the silence by grumbling “Fuck” or “Shit” under his breath.</p><p>Rosenstock’s new album, Hellmode, will be released in just a few weeks, but right now it’s his day job, scoring the music for the Emmy-nominated animated series <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/02/craig-of-the-creek-an-endearing-funny-and-imaginative-kids-show-for-fans-of-hilda-and-bluey" title="">Craig of the Creek</a>, that’s keeping him busy.

<p>The Dutch player comes into this year’s US Open undefeated in singles since February 2021 and has her sights set on victory once again</p><p>Dutch wheelchair tennis champion Diede de Groot is so dominant within her sport that she’s capable of literary alchemy – she transmutes hyperbole into fact. For example, although de Groot enters this year’s US Open as the tournament’s five-time reigning champion, it might be more accurate to describe her as the reigning “everything” champion. She’s won every singles tournament she’s entered this year – just as she did in 2022.</p><p>In fact, de Groot hasn’t lost a singles match since February 2021, a streak that stretched to 111 matches (and counting) after her victory in last month’s Wimbledon final. During that span, she’s won 12 consecutive grand slam tournaments, along with gold medals at the Paralympics and the European Para Championships. And, if she wins the US Open again in the coming days, de Groot will secure her <em>third</em> <em>consecutive</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)">calendar-year grand slam</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/28/diede-de-groot-tenniss-everything-champion-eyes-13th-straight-grand-slam">Continue reading...</a>

<p>What’s not to love about a fruit that’s plentiful, free and so very versatile? Get picking!</p><p></p><p>I used to live across the road from a park overrun with brambles. They weren’t wild blackberries, but some kind of cultivar that had broken free, people said, from allotments during the second world war. That meant the berries were bigger and ripened considerably earlier than the wild ones. People started picking them in late July, and after a couple of years I started to blindly follow their example.</p><p>Collecting them was easy; the difficulty lay in figuring out what to do with them. Generally, after suffering an acute failure of imagination, I would produce eight to 10 jars of blackberry jam, most of them given away at Christmas to people who must have suspected I held some kind of grudge against them. No matter: as long as you get little kids to make your labels for you, people feel uncomfortable complaining.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/aug/28/berry-good-17-wonderful-ways-with-blackberries-from-crumbles-and-cakes-to-mousses-and-muffins">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Running on fumes after yet another night battling insomnia, noisy neighbours or small children? We’ll get you through the day</p><p>The world is full of advice on how to get a good night’s sleep, but sometimes doing so just isn’t possible. If you are struggling with a sleep disorder, are a shift worker or have a toddler who wakes every few hours, being told how to sleep well can be galling. For others, despite feeling knackered all day, a fourth episode of The Bear can seem more appealing than going to bed.</p><p>How do you know if you are sleep-deprived? For some people, the answer will be obvious; for others, it may be less so. Russell Foster, a professor of circadian neuroscience at the University of Oxford, specifies three signs that you are probably not getting enough sleep: “Feeling that you don’t perform at your peak during the day; oversleeping on free days; or craving a nap during the day.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/aug/28/tired-grumpy-self-medicating-with-kitkats-and-coffee-heres-how-the-experts-handle-sleep-deprivation">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The DeepMind co-founder calls for the ‘containment’ of new technology in a heartfelt and candid exploration of what the future may hold for us</p><p>What is it with wave metaphors? Technological determinists – people who believe that technology drives history – love them. Think of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/03/alvin-toffler-obituary">Alvin Toffler</a>, who saw the history of civilisation as a succession of three such waves (agricultural, industrial and post-industrial). The idea is of immense power, unstoppable, moving inexorably towards us as we cower before its immensity, much as the dinosaurs must have done when they saw the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/oct/26/terrawatch-asteroid-dinosaurs-global-mega-tsunami-impact">mile-high tsunami</a> heading in their direction.</p><p>Mustafa Suleyman says he is not a determinist, but at times he sounds awfully like one. “At its heart,” he writes at one point, “technology emerges to fill human needs. If people have powerful reasons to build and use it, it will get built and used. Yet in most discussions of technology people still get stuck on what it is, forgetting why it was created in the first place. This is not about some innate techno-determinism. This is about what it means to be human.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/28/the-coming-wave-by-mustafa-suleyman-review-ai-synthetic-biology-and-a-new-dawn-for-humanity">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From characters’ irrepressible horniness to a deeply confusing instigating incident, Ryan Hendrick’s hiking slasher has all the hallmarks of a dud</p><p>‘Oh and Rhona … remember, the secret is to never look back,” says sinister hitchhiker Carla (Nicolette McKeown), as she climbs a cliff. “You mean down,” someone corrects her. Yes, we get the point, given that half the characters in the film are nursing past traumas, from random acts of rural brutality to Middle Eastern combat theatre flashbacks. But such is the unsubtle way of Ryan Hendrick’s overblown Highland horror; it can’t settle for simply being a stripped-down descent into wilderness atavism. It also chucks in an irrepressibly horny crew of hikers, creepy Scottish folktales and gratuitous Homeric quotations for good measure.</p><p>The real killer is the highly implausible instigating incident. Rhona (Lauren Lyle) and pals set off on to the moors to locate the family cabin she has been bequeathed, despite grim memories of the area. But then tensions, especially simmering sexual jealousy, rise when they lose their bearings and combat veteran Carla takes matters into her own hands. It’s not really clear why she takes such drastic action, other than the need – with her insistence that they are now bound together by this terrible event – to get these sorry daytrippers marching even further towards backwoods peril.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/28/mercy-falls-review-hiking-horror-scottish">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Explosion of sports betting in US represents a rising threat, with PGA Tour needing to fiercely protect integrity of competition</p><p>Jay Monahan speaks so sparingly that the PGA Tour commissioner had plenty of time to plot and plan precisely what his message would be during traditional end-of-season media duties in Atlanta last Tuesday. When pressed on even light detail of how a framework agreement between the PGA Tour, the DP World Tour and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Group may take on more formal status, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/22/jay-monahan-believes-deal-between-pga-and-liv-will-be-completed-on-time" title="">Monahan was completely noncommittal</a>. The 53-year-old may soon realise, if he has not already, that Saudis bearing billions do so with more than a passing interest in how their buck is being deployed. He who pays the piper, and all that.</p><p>What Monahan appears very keen to stress is that he is working for the good of the PGA Tour. This is fair enough, in theory – the organisation pays him $14m a year, according to the most recent report – but belies the sense that elite golf is now all about a collective good. Monahan at least left the impression the DP World Tour, LIV and various other related parties have to fall into line.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/aug/28/golf-gambling-sports-betting-pga-tour-jay-monahan-phil-mickelson-jon-rahm">Continue reading...</a>

<p>West Ham’s successful summer transfers, Bissouma’s revival and Kalajdzic’s well-timed Wolves comeback</p><p>It’s a while since Newcastle began a game against Liverpool as favourites, but that was their status pre-match, a situation they attacked with typical intensity. But with the visitors threatening an equaliser, Eddie Howe had a decision to make: close the game down, or seek a clinching goal? In the event, he did a bit of both, making like-for-like or defensive changes, but without ordering his players to stop pressing. Darwin Nuñez twice found space in behind his back four, and though it required a little good fortune and two fantastic finishes for his team to have the game snatched from them, with more emphatic instructions, the hosts might have seen out the win. Howe may have only got the Newcastle job because better-qualified candidates were busy, but he has done a superb job since. Given the nature of both football and his bosses, in order to keep it he should change his mentality to that of a big-club manager – and fast. <strong>Daniel Harris</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/28/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action">Continue reading...</a>

## Baby sleep has become a sign of parenting competence – and a source of shame | Lucy Pasha-Robinson

<p>Admitting my two-year-old still wakes at night can elicit a gasp of horror. Expectations around infant sleep are often way off</p><p>Expecting your first baby? An inescapable truth is that you are about to lose a lot of sleep. You will know by now that seasoned, weather-beaten parents relish sharing this news. “It’s all about survival in the early days,” friends would say, when I was pregnant. “Enjoy those lie-ins while you can!”</p><p>By the time my daughter arrived, I had collected a small armoury of tools for the battle against her anticipated wakefulness. Swaddles, blackout blinds, a white-noise machine; for months after she was born, I used apps to obsessively track her <a href="https://www.happiestbaby.com/blogs/baby/wake-windows">“wake windows”</a> and sleep totals to the minute, determined to crack the code for a good night’s sleep. When I think back to her first summer, I’m transported to my in-laws’ attic bedroom, where I spent hours in the dark, sound machine blaring, rocking her – willing her – to nap. But no matter what I did, my daughter never slept well, and I nearly drove myself mad in pursuit of discovering <em>why</em>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/28/baby-sleep-parenting-competence-shame">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Hani Hape has recreated the infamous photographer’s overtly sexual photographs of female nudes – using naked men instead. But the results, while fascinating, raise even more issues</p><p>In John Berger’s highly regarded book Ways of Seeing, he closed his chapter on the nude by posing a challenge: “Choose from this book an image of a traditional nude. Transform the woman into a man. Either in your mind’s eye or by drawing on the reproduction. Then notice the violence which that transformation does. Not to the image, but to the assumptions of a likely viewer.”</p><p>It seems a simple experiment. Can we change white into black and black into white, flip the script and see it anew?

<p>Alf Ramsey<em> </em>– still the only manager of any England side to lead the country to World Cup glory<em> – </em>is the complex central figure in Duncan Hamilton’s elegiac account of the shadow that fell across the coach and his players after 1966</p><p>Duncan Hamilton’s account of England’s World Cup victory of 1966 is written in sorrow, and in anger, and in a melancholy acceptance of what befell the sporting heroes of yesteryear. It is sometimes agonising to read, because we are made aware of how the bright star of a single summer’s day is set against the long haul of lives drifting into eclipse. Agonising, but also absorbing. Like all the best football books, <em>Answered Prayers</em> is not just about football; it’s about hope and despair, friendship and enmity, and the character it takes to handle them.</p><p>The particular character it concerns is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/alf-ramsey">Alf Ramsey</a>, the man who masterminded the England team’s finest hour. Hamilton begins by visiting his statue, obscurely situated in Portman Road, Ipswich, ignored by all but the pigeons. Yet in life it would be Ramsey’s fate to endure much worse than bird shit. Born poor in Dagenham in 1920 – his father was described in the census as a “hay &amp; straw dealer”, like an indigent from Henry Mayhew – he was driven by football and self-improvement, carefully planing down the edges of his cockney accent. After a distinguished playing career (Southampton, Spurs, 32 caps for England), he joined unfancied Ipswich Town as manager in the mid-1950s and within six years had engineered a remarkable ascent from the old Third Division to First Division champions in their debut season.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/28/answered-prayers-england-and-the-1966-world-cup-duncan-hamilton-review-agonising-and-absorbing">Continue reading...</a>

<p>My husband and I have wasted a full month of our lives watching MasterChef Australia and My Kitchen Rules. We don’t even like cooking!</p><p>‘We can’t go on like this,” I said to my husband yesterday, urgently. “This” being our pandemic-induced addiction to Australian TV cooking competitions. We’re hopelessly in thrall to Aussie MasterChef and My Kitchen Rules (a sort of supercharged Come Dine With Me) and have consumed countless hours of each. Well, I suppose I could count: we’ve watched perhaps 15 seasons of 50-plus episodes and each episode lasts an hour. That’s a full month of our lives measured out in dodgy fondants, oven malfunctions and a truly regrettable number of savoury ice-creams. How many times have I shouted “Never shell prawns under time pressure!” in exasperation? How many times has my husband tutted as candidates swoon over the “sexy” French chef and host Manu Feildel, claiming he looks like a plumber he knows? So many, too many.</p><p>My rock-bottom moment was prompted by the depraved extremes now required to get our fix. I downloaded another obscure streaming platform with an appalling interface last week (it doesn’t even have a “continue watching” feature, imagine), and I could have written several novels in the hours I’ve spent watching a stupid beer advert featuring “Barcelona singer Bad Gyal”. All for what? A brief hit of some beardie from the Northern Territory back in the mid-2010s wondering whether macadamia crumb is an appropriate “textural element” for his kangaroo rendang. Then there is the fact that the My Kitchen Rules host Pete Evans became an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/chef-pete-evans-criticised-for-trying-to-sell-15000-light-device-to-fight-coronavirus">antivax conspiracy theorist and crank</a>.

<p>Fiona Allen fell in love with drama as a little girl. Half a century later, she seized the chance to live her dream</p><p>When Fiona Allen was seven, her parents took her to the theatre in Inverness, where they lived, to see a production of AA Milne’s story The House at Pooh Corner. Instantly, Allen fell in love. “The moment I saw Christopher Robin come into the white spotlight, I was starstruck,” she says. But although she took part in school and college plays, she never thought it could lead to a career. Instead, she studied business at university and joined the civil service, working for the Land Register of Scotland until she retired in 2012. Her newly free time reignited a decades-old spark. “I still wanted to do something with my brain so I went back to university to study theatre and performance,” says Allen, who’s now 72.</p><p>That year, she took part in a folk drama workshop and discovered mumming, an ancient masked form, in which male actors travel through villages, performing simple plays, often in exchange for food or shelter. “It’s a simpler story than conventional plays. It has one central conflict and sword fight, rather than slow character development. It’s steeped in history and involves more improvisation because the play is always tailored to a local audience,” says Allen.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/aug/28/a-new-start-after-60-i-retired-and-became-an-actor-in-a-mask">Continue reading...</a>

## More cancer screenings sounds like good news. But can the NHS cope with them? | Christina Pagel

<p>Earlier detection means more successful treatment – but also a drain on resources for an already creaking health service</p><p>This month, it was reported that England’s existing screening programme for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/aug/09/screening-programme-has-prevented-20000-cases-of-bowel-cancer-in-england?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Other">bowel cancer</a> for 60 to 74-year-olds had prevented 20,000 cases of bowel cancer over the past 10 years. This comes amid an ongoing effort in England to <a href="https://view-health-screening-recommendations.service.gov.uk/bowel-cancer/">extend bowel cancer screening</a> to those aged between 50 and 59. And in June, the NHS national director for cancer <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-65775159">welcomed a new blood test</a> currently being trialled in the UK that can detect 50 types of the disease.</p><p>More cancer screening seems like unqualified good news: generally, the earlier cancer is diagnosed, the higher the chance of successful treatment. However, there are harms that come with screening, too, both for people being screened and for the NHS as a whole that should be mitigated against. I am certainly not discouraging people from taking up screening offers, but expansion of screening programmes must come with concrete plans about delivery. This requires extra NHS fundingand capacity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/28/cancer-screenings-nhs-detection-treatment-health-service">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Using family photographs, journals, letters and handwritten lyrics, a new book sheds fresh light on the great singer’s life – while hinting at the tragedy to come. We publish exclusive images from the often heartbreaking work</p><p></p><p>In the middle of the new book Amy Winehouse: In Her Words, there is a list of ambitions, penned when the late singer was a 16-year-old student at The Brit School. Some of them are standard teenage dreams: she wants to own a house in South Beach, Miami, and “300 pairs of shoes”; she wants fabulous hair – and her designs on a then-famous pop star are expressed in very forthright terms indeed. She seems more interested in becoming an actor than a musician – she wants to work with Michael Madsen and Steve Buscemi and “do a movie where I look ugly” – although she does express a desire to collaborate with Missy Elliott and producer Timbaland. Perhaps the most striking entry is No 12: “To have people look up to me.”</p><p>She certainly achieved that: 12 years after her death, Winehouse is still, by consent, the most influential British pop artist of the 21st century, revered by Lana Del Rey, Sam Smith, Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars, credited by Adele with “paving the way for artists like me”. We are still surrounded by echoes of her music: whenever you hear a bluntly confessional female singer-songwriter, or a retro-soul affectation in an arrangement, or a pop singer with a slurred, prematurely aged vocal style – and you hear those things all the time in 2023 – it’s more than likely <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/13/best-album-21st-century-amy-winehouse-back-to-black">Back to Black</a>, her 2006 album, is somewhere in their musical DNA.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/28/diaries-amy-winehouse-tragedy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Despite constant death threats, documentary-maker Shea has been investigating  the world’s most notorious misogynist since 2019. But even he was shocked by what he uncovered working on his latest film</p><p>‘You’d be forgiven for looking at Andrew Tate, especially at our age, and thinking: ‘This guy must be some niche figure,’” Matt Shea tells me, in a meeting room at the BBC headquarters in central London. What a courteous young film-maker, I think, because he is 31 and I am <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/07/i-am-50-today-and-i-no-longer-care-what-anyone-thinks-about-my-age" title="">old enough to be his mum</a>. “But there was a recent survey by Hope Not Hate which found that <a href="https://hopenothate.org.uk/andrew-tate/" title="">52% of 16- and 17-year-old boys in the UK</a> have a positive view of Andrew Tate, and were more likely to have heard of him than they were Rishi Sunak.”</p><p>I struggle to believe this: Tate is an ultra-misogynist provocateur, currently <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-65959097" title="">charged in Romania with human trafficking</a> and forming an organised crime ring, with investigations ongoing into the trafficking of minors. He is also an obvious blowhard and attention-seeker, and I know enough teenagers to think that surely more than half of them would despise him on that basis alone. I’m wrong, though. Shea continues: “And that number goes a bit higher when [the respondents are] younger, similar surveys all across the world. US, Australia, India: he’s huge all across the world. You may not have heard of Andrew Tate, or you may have heard of him but think it’s universally accepted that he’s a bad person. But your children, your nephews, they are watching him right now and they may not have the same view.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/aug/28/to-his-followers-this-man-is-a-messiah-matt-shea-on-his-long-fight-to-expose-andrew-tate">Continue reading...</a>

I was deeply saddened and devastated, but not surprised.</p><p>The region where this dreadful event occurred has been one of the fastest warming areas on Earth, and as temperature records are being broken year after year, a catastrophe of this kind was a matter of time. For nearly two decades, scientists have developed models to predict the potential impact of raising temperatures on emperor penguins to establish what the future would hold for these magnificent birds.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/28/emperor-penguin-extinction">Continue reading...</a>

<ul><li>Hovland collects $18m bonus on taking FedEx Cup in Georgia</li><li>‘What a finish, what a guy,’ says Europe captain Luke Donald</li></ul><p>The finest fortnight of Viktor Hovland’s career has boosted European hopes of reclaiming the Ryder Cup in Rome. On putting performance alone, the 25-year-old must be striking fear into previously bullish Americans.</p><p>Hovland, who shot a closing 61 to win the BMW Championship last weekend, backed up his heroics with comfortable success at the Tour Championship. A euphoric Hovland therefore took delivery of the FedEx Cup and $18m bonus as attached. The Norwegian has catapulted himself firmly into the world’s elite; which will be much to the delight of Luke Donald, Europe’s Ryder Cup captain. Less than a month will pass before Hovland, Donald and the rest of the team land in Italy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/28/viktor-hovland-strolls-to-tour-championship-to-boost-ryder-cup-hand">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Passageways built under Taipei’s famous Grand Hotel during the Chiang Kai-shek era are attracting tourists keen to know their history</p><p>Over the years there have been many rumours about the secret tunnels under Taipei’s Grand Hotel. Some say they were secret passageways to the presidential office five kilometres away. Others say they led to the Songshan airport or a secret military base. Now, the rumours are that the tunnels will shelter VIPs should the city come under attack from China’s People’s Liberation Army.</p><p>The tunnels were built in the 1970s, as part of a major renovation of the hotel, amid the twin fears of the cold war and a Chinese attack. They were designed to provide an escape for Chiang Kai-shek, the ageing authoritarian leader of the Republic of China (Taiwan’s formal name) and any world dignitaries who happen to be visiting. Construction was completed in 1973, just two years before Chiang’s death.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/28/secret-escape-slide-for-taiwans-former-leader-draws-in-the-crowds-just-dont-ask-for-a-go">Continue reading...</a>
