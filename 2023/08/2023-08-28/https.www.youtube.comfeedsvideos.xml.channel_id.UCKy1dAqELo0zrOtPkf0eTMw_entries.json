Also available on PlayStation 4, Xbox, PC, and Switch.\n\nSea of Stars is an excellent tribute RPG that channels the best parts of its \u201890s-era forebears like Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy 6, and even Star Ocean: The Second Story. Because of that, it\u2019s fair to say that its world, graphical style, and mechanics aren\u2019t wholly original, but there are enough interesting twists in its 30-hour story to make for a rich and enjoyable experience of its own merit. This isn\u2019t just nostalgia fodder. That said, its twitchy combat can be difficult to get a handle on, and once you do, it only stays interesting for so long before its limited customization options make it start to feel just a little repetitive. That\u2019s made up for by a strong soundtrack, an approachable and endearing story, and a wide number of fun zones and boss fights that make this a trip worth taking.\n\n#SeaOfStars #Review", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sr2by2oOFI", "date_published": "2023-08-28T14:09:21.409202+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Ign - YouTube", "album": "Ign - YouTube", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/1sr2by2oOFI/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Space Nation Online: 4 Minutes of Cinematic Alpha Build Gameplay", "description": "Get a look at four minutes of alpha-build gameplay from Space Nation Online, the upcoming space-combat MMORPG from Roland Emmerich (Independence Day), Jerome Wu (World of Warcraft), Tony Tang (Warframe), and Marco Weber (The Thirteenth Floor) that aims to be at the center of a new sci-fi transmedia universe.\n\n#SpaceNationOnline #Gameplay", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9x6L2aFLKPk", "date_published": "2023-08-28T13:10:49.730101+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Ign - YouTube", "album": "Ign - YouTube", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/9x6L2aFLKPk/hqdefault.jpg"}]
