		Passengers flying from Helsinki to Croatia and the United Kingdom can now show a digital ID instead of an ID card or passport.

Finland's pilot of digital travel credentials began August 28, allowing passengers on Finnair to London, Edinburgh and Manchester to pass through border control using their phone.

Croatia is also participating in <a href="https://raja.fi/en/dtc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the pilot</a> at the border checkpoints of Zagreb International Airport this fall.

The project is limited to border control at Helsinki’s Vantaa Airport. Passengers will need to download an app, register with the police using their passports and take a selfie.

Digital credentials were slated for a pilot on KLM Royal Dutch Airlines flights between the Netherlan

		Law enforcement in the U.S. used <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/clearview-ai">Clearview AI</a>’s facial recognition in a recent investigation of sexual offences against children, which drew in the involvement of police in Australia. The experience may be reopening the debate about whether law enforcement in the country should also have access to the biometric tool.

An Australian former detective told Australia’s <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=gWpXevs7rZc">7News</a> that the investigation, led by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/us-homeland-security-is-using-clearview-ai-to-crack-pedophile-cold-cases">Homeland Security Investigations</a> (HIS) unit, resulted in the identificatio

		Companies are pitching biometric payment solutions as a solution to fraud and theft. But their fast expansion is making some consumers and privacy advocates wary – especially when companies do not offer alternative payment options. By 2026, almost <a href="https://www.goodeintelligence.com/report/biometrics-payments-market-technology-analysis-adoption-strategies-and-forecasts-2021-2026/">$5.8 trillion</a> in payments are expected to be made using biometrics each year, according to a Goode Intelligence forecast.

The latest example comes from California. Biometrics fintech firm<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/popid"> PopID</a> invited scrutiny at a student event at the University of Southern California (USC) campus in Los Angeles after leaving no choice to

		Patrick Höijer is out as CEO of software-and-sensor maker Precise Biometrics. Höijer reportedly quit on amicable terms just more than a year after taking the chair.

<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/precise-biometrics">The company</a> has suffered several years of faltering business fundamentals, including net losses.

		Deepfake fraud's still rising, with the latest example uncovered in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, insiders warn that detection tools must improve at examining darker skin.

Hong Kong police have cracked the first case in that financial hub involving deepfakes to deceive banks and other lenders.

Police arrested six people who doctored eight stolen images alongside pilfered Hong Kong ID cards and proofs of address and income. The suspects allegedly used fraudulent documents to apply for at least 20 loans online. One of the applications was approved for a HK$70,000 (US$8,937) loan, the South China Morning Post <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3232273/hong-kong-police-arrest-6-crackdown-fraud-syndicate-using-ai-deepfake-technology-apply-loans" rel="noop

		Little progress has been recorded for a bill in the U.S. state of Missouri that would protect biometric information from misuse by businesses.

The Biometric Information Privacy Act, (House Bill 1047) introduced to Missouri's lower house in February, has <a href="https://house.mo.gov/Bill.aspx?bill=HB1047&amp;year=2023&amp;code=R" rel="noopener" target="_blank">languished</a> in the Emerging Issues Committee since May.

From the steam-powered First Industrial Revolution to the digitalization and automation of Industry 4.0, our modern world has been continually redefined by a series of rapid advances that have demanded a recalibration of societal norms and practices.

With its breakneck pace and widespread capability for disruption, AI technology fits this pattern of technological upheaval. Its analytical process and ability to mimic human cognition means AI has near-endless potential. In the biometrics field, AI analytics is delivering unparalleled speed and accuracy for verification.

As technology weaves itself into the very fabric of our lives, it brings both profound opportunit

		As the European Union inches toward the completion of its <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/ai-act">Artificial Intelligence Act</a>, human rights organizations are warning about the risks posed by mass biometric surveillance while countries such as Spain are introducing new agencies dedicated to supervising AI.

The Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), a non-governmental organization focused on digital rights, warns that the debate around biometric surveillance – one of the most controversial issues within the AI Act – is far from decided.

		Outgoing UK Biometrics and Surveillance Camera Commissioner Fraser Sampson says in a response to the consultation on biometric information by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner that the idea of establishing a biometrics code of practice is a good one. The details of the new regulatory framework will be important, however, and ensure biometrics use is permissible and publicly acceptable.

The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/opc-consultation-on-biometric-information-commissioner-response/commissioner-response-to-the-opc-consultation-on-biometric-information">policy paper</a> from Sampson notes that the capabilities of biometric surveillance systems are growing at an accelerating pace, and accordingly so is their effectiveness.
