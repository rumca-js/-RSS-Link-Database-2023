Now, she's got beef with the prince.</p><p>\"There's a big focus on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her. So, we didn't do that this time. It's really not about the love story at all, which is really, really wonderful ...

There is a belief that it is deliberate. The movie is a holdover from the Bob Chapek, the former CEO who went to war with GOP presidential candidate Ron DeSantis and lost. Like all of the movies that <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/little-mermaid-south-korea\" target=\"_blank\">have gone broke for going woke</a>, they know <em>Snow White </em>is going to be a disaster and this is them getting ahead of it. It would explain why they originally said those photos of the six mystical creatures and Peter Dinklage (<a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/snow-white-dwarf-actor\" target=\"_blank\">who made sure no other dwarf would be in the movie</a>) were fake. No one in the new regime <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/disney-snow-white-photos\" target=\"_blank\">believed Disney would do something so stupid</a>.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emzanotti/status/1690742518747385856\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Everyone knows what happens next. Ziegler's PR team picks out a few tweets of people leaving mean comments on social media and claim she's being bullied. The studio then tries to use that to promote the movie. Even though the hatred over how much <a href=\"https://www.tmz.com/2023/08/12/rachel-zegler-hating-on-snow-white-compared-halle-bailey/\" target=\"_blank\">Zeigler hates Snow White is bipartisan</a>.</p><p>And look, I'm not the one who will be losing money on this. Neither niece is going to drag me to it. I'll stop caring as soon as I press the publish button on this post. But I have to ask, what's the point? If you are going to take a movie people have loved for generations and change EVERYTHING ABOUT IT, why bother?</p><p><span></span>If you want a woke, feminist fairytale, create new content. You can still call the character Snow White. \"Snow\" can be a nickname for how she blows away the patriarchy. And the seven dwarves can be seven short kings she's competing against for a vice president of marketing job at <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light\" target=\"_self\">Bud Light</a>.</p><p>Again, this is Disney's investor's money to set on fire. It affects me zero other than for cheap content. But still, I just don't get the point.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.
