<p><strong>Assembly George Square, Edinburgh</strong><br />Seventies spy novels, sexually frustrated poultry, an April Fools’ Day breakup … it’s all here in the sophomore show from Rosie Nicholls and Sullivan Brown</p><p>Do you need some framing device or overarching concept to sell a sketch show these days? It looks as if double-act Grubby Little Mitts have a corker on their hands at the start of Hello, Hi, which sets up two porous realities: the placid present moment and some nightmare sketch-comedy realm – all panic and delinquent behaviour – bursting out of two boxes centre-stage. It’s a high-stakes and whirlwind start to this sophomore show from Rosie Nicholls and Sullivan Brown, but it’s not a conceit they choose to sustain for the whole show.</p><p>We’re soon back in the territory of one sketch after another, with the only connecting tissue Nicholls and Brown’s warmth, between-scene backchat, and, particularly in Nicholls’ case, performing flair. Some standout scenes are all her, like the one in which she fences around a romantic proposal with so many qualifiers that she traps herself. A later solo scene pastiching sexist 70s spy novels is less buoyant.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/13/grubby-little-mitts-review-edinburgh-festival-sketch-comedy-assembly-george-square">Continue reading...</a>

At that point Sarina Wiegman’s team stopped being the familiar faces in the draw, the mother country, the cultural brethren. They are the Poms.

<p>So unworthy of our attention are the notorious Soviet spies behind the hit ITV drama that this look at their life even manages to make the ex Tory PM look good. Can we stop this now?</p><p>I must confess to a bit of a blind spot when it comes to understanding the apparently enduring – if the appearance of yet another documentary about them in the year of our Lord 2023 is anything to go by – appeal of the Cambridge Four. The great unmasking of Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean, Kim Philby and Anthony Blunt as Soviet agents took place largely in the 50s and 60s, and the last of them died in 1988. To those born after the event, it feels like ancient and baffling history, the fundamentals of which are easy to grasp (bunch of pricks get enamoured of communism at university, fail to grow out of it, betray their country but are surrounded by enough similar pricks to escape due censure) and so dispiriting that most of us prefer to turn away and concentrate on the many better things in life instead. But to a certain demographic (the prick-adjacent? The namelessly frustrated who dream of doing something as big, as disruptive as selling big, disruptive secrets to the Russians instead of distributing memes on the internet?) they remain entrancing. Like a Bloomsbury set for centrist dads.</p><p>But this demographic is surely ageing. A new audience must be found, the prickish torch passed! And so to The Real Spies Among Friends, an hour-long documentary narrated by who else but that master of prickish characters Roger Allam. It is a companion piece to the drama series <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/08/a-spy-among-friends-review-dont-take-your-eyes-off-this-star-packed-espionage-thriller">A Spy Among Friends</a>, which centres round Guy Pearce as Kim Philby and Damian Lewis as Nicholas Elliott – the former’s best friend who believed in his innocence so deeply that he actually brought him back into MI6 even after it was, uh, pretty clear he helped Maclean and Burgess defect to Moscow just before they were due to be arrested for handing over literal suitcasefuls of top-secret secrets to the Russians since about 1940.</p><p>The Real Spies Among Friends aired on ITV1 and is <a href="https://www.itv.com/watch/the-real-spies-among-friends/10a3398">available on ITVX</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/aug/13/the-real-spies-among-friends-review-the-person-who-comes-out-of-this-documentary-best-thatcher">Continue reading...</a>

By the age of 20 she was ranked No 1, a status she consolidated thoroughly by occupying the spot for 71 weeks. Having rounded off her storied career by winning a long-awaited first grand slam at the 2018 Australian Open, content with all that she had achieved in the sport, Wozniacki retired at 29 in 2020.</p><p>Yet after three years of retirement, during which she gave birth to two children, Wozniacki is back.

<p><strong>Assembly Roxy, Edinburgh</strong><br />The US writer, comedian and actor’s cabaret show includes potent songs about sexuality, identity and police violence</p><p>Triple-threat doesn’t begin to describe the abilities of Larry Owens, a writer, singer, comedian, Broadway star and more besides. The Baltimore man originated the main role of Usher in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/06/sex-strange-loop-queer-black-broadway-megasmash-michael-r-jackson-lion-king-usher">hit musical A Strange Loop</a> and appeared in the TV comedies <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jun/01/abbott-elementary-review-the-gags-come-so-thick-and-fast-they-take-your-breath-away">Abbott Elementary</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/31/search-party-hipster-murder-mystery-satire-all4">Search Party</a>, all while honing his musical-comedy craft on the same New York cabaret circuit as recent Edinburgh favourite <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/dec/30/comedian-catherine-cohen-interview">Cat Cohen</a>. His skills are as blazing as Cohen’s, even if this fringe debut is not the finished article.</p><p>It’s arguably more showcase than show, with Owens hurling at us song after song – now angel-voiced, now raising the rafters. This stuff is engineered for whoops and cheers, a response which, if not forthcoming, Owens will openly insist upon. His opening number heralds his uncategorisable individuality: he’s “too white for black people, too poor for rich people”, and – take a deep breath – “too self-actualised to be recognised by the marginalised identities white men made to define me”. Later tracks hymn his transactional relationship with his therapist, or find him pastiching Billie Eilish and Lil Nas X in comic songs about, respectively, the opioid epidemic and having a homophobic mum.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/13/larry-owens-review-assembly-roxy-edinburgh-festival-cabaret">Continue reading...</a>

Both Andy Burnham and Sadiq Khan have pursued policies at odds with the leader of the opposition. Keir Starmer has openly attacked both of them as a result. Unlike MPs or councillors, mayors are not subject to a whip. And Sir Keir, it seems, does not like their independence.</p><p>I am the independent metro mayor of the North of Tyne. It was independent behaviour that painted a target on my back and led the Labour party to block me. I do not fit the media label of a Corbynista – I’m noted for working cross-party and landing the best funded devolution deal in England. For setting up a venture capital fund and landing inward investment on the one hand, while working well with trade unions and the voluntary sector on the other. Strong on climate action, but great on taxpayer value for money. Tories, Liberal Democrats and independents openly praised my work and pragmatic approach long before Labour blocked me.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/aug/13/independent-politicians-cannot-be-silenced-by-westminster">Continue reading...</a>

Artist whose unmistakable record sleeve designs contributed to the tumultuous impact of the Sex Pistols in the 1970s<p>The outbreak of musical and social anarchy in the UK triggered by the arrival of the Sex Pistols in the 1970s was not merely a musical phenomenon, but a sociological and political one too. Pivotal to the group’s tumultuous impact was the graphic design work of Jamie Reid, whose artwork for the band was as thrilling and unforgettable as their music, and who has died aged 76.</p><p>Reid’s sleeve for the November 1976 single Anarchy in the UK, with its ripped Union Jack pierced by safety pins holding the band name and song title in blackmailer-style cut-up lettering, set the tone (Reid also contributed ideas to the song’s lyrics). But his most enduring coup was the sleeve for the second single, God Save the Queen (May 1977), depicting the monarch (and based on a portait by the royal photographer Peter Grugeon) in her Silver Jubilee year, blindfolded by the song’s title, and rendered mute by having her lips sealed by the words “Sex Pistols”.

<p>The move to a back three has worked well but there is a lack of creativity, and how will they deal with the Australia fans?</p><p>There were concerns about England’s backline before the start of the World Cup, with the Euro 2022 captain Leah Williamson out injured and Millie Bright not having played a competitive game since March because of a knee injury. Conversely, England’s defensive stability has been a highlight of their campaign. Sarina Wiegman’s side have conceded just twice in normal time and the decision to switch to a back three, utilising the forward-thinking Lucy Bronze and Rachel Daly as wing-backs, has proved a master stroke. The three centre-backs – Jess Carter, Millie Bright and Alex Greenwood – have all been superb with Carter probably England’s best one v one defender during the tournament and Bright a towering rock with the capacity to push forward through the middle. However, Greenwood’s performances warrant extra praise. The left-footed former full-back has arguable been England’s best player. She has completed more successful passes and more attacking passes than any other player in the tournament. What a difference from a year ago when she was forced on to the bench during the Euros as the partnership between Williamson and Bright blossomed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/13/sarina-wiegman-england-womens-world-cup-football-australia">Continue reading...</a>

Best of all is the throbbing, synth-driven Car Chase. As with all of <a href="https://www.pilofficial.com/#/">PiL</a>’s recent albums, <em>End of World</em> is frustratingly hit and miss – the staccato glam-rock stylings of The Do That are particularly annoying – but then you suspect that the arch contrarian Lydon wouldn’t have it any other way.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/13/public-image-ltd-end-of-world-review-a-frustratingly-mixed-bag-john-lydon-hawaii">Continue reading...</a>

## Should I worry about my BMI?

<p>Devised almost 200 years ago, body mass index is used as a marker of health by many, yet called useless by others. What’s the truth?</p><p>If I were writing about 200 years ago, the title of this column would be Should I worry about my Quetelet Index?. That’s what BMI, the body mass index, was known as when the statistician and sociologist Adolphe Quetelet devised it in the 1830s. But Quetelet never intended the measure as a means of medical assessment. Two centuries later, plenty of experts will tell you that it doesn’t exactly work as advertised either. So is it time to throw it out altogether, or can it still tell us something useful about our health?</p><p>To get the basics out of the way, your BMI is simply your mass (in kilos) divided by the square of your height (in metres), expressed in the units kg/m2. According to the NHS, a calculation in the healthy weight range is between 18.5 and 24.9 – though this can differ slightly among ethnic groups. Obviously, this doesn’t work as well as a measure for children, old people or pregnant women, but where things get trickier is among groups with higher muscle mass and bone density, who can often be classed as “obese” or “overweight”, even when they are sporting a well-defined six pack.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/aug/13/should-i-worry-about-my-bmi">Continue reading...</a>

It was the novel’s toughness – the brutal sudden deaths unleashed by the 1918 flu pandemic, or Ursula’s marriage to a violent abuser – that prevented it from dissipating into whimsy and created a more fluid, generative sense of what chance and choice might signify in fictional terms.</p><p>Foregrounding the artifice that underlies all imaginative worlds is not, however, to be attempted lightly. It’s a lesson that Franklin, a recurring character in these 11 linked stories written over several years, finds when he embarks on his own Great Novel, a series of “What if?” scenarios governed by chaos theory that quickly collapses into its own chaotic indeterminacy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/13/normal-rules-dont-apply-by-kate-atkinson-review-food-for-thought-but-such-small-portions">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Observer film critic on his hero, who died last week aged 87, a man dedicated to telling stories his way and who had a wicked sense of humour</p><p>In his excellent 1990 biography, <em>Hurricane Billy: The Stormy Life and Films of William Friedkin</em>, writer Nat Segaloff quotes the Oscar-winning film-maker as wryly observing: “You know what it’s going to say on my tombstone? It’s going to say ‘The Man Who Directed <em>The Exorcist.’</em>” As someone who has spent a lifetime declaring <em>The Exorcist </em>(1973) to be the greatest movie ever made, I understand how it might perhaps have overshadowed a career that was as long as it was varied.</p><p>Yet Friedkin, whom I first met back in the 1990s when I was a starstruck fan (which I remained), did so much more than helm the movie that changed my life – and the lives of many others. He proved himself one of the most fearless and inventive directors of his generation, working in a string of genres – from musical comedy to serious psychodrama; political satire to police thriller; stage play adaptations to tales of supernatural terror – with equal ease and enthusiasm.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/13/my-friend-billy-mark-kermode-remembers-exorcist-director-william-friedkin">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Henry Moore Institute, Leeds</strong><br />Crouching calligraphy, a radiant riposte, a 12-step interrogation of strangers… words take shape in myriad ways as 18 artists explore what happens when poetry and sculpture collide</p><p>There is a beautiful work in <strong><a href="https://henry-moore.org/whats-on/the-weight-of-words/">The Weight of Words</a></strong>, a show about the overlap between poetry and sculpture, that consists entirely of a single noun printed in grey on a page. “Stilllife” is the word – every letter, except for the first and the last, running together in a fence of shadowy verticals.</p><p>It alludes to the art of still life painting, of course, where drooping flowers are supposed to double as memento mori. But more than that, it speaks of life stilled to the point of death. The ashen colour is nearly fading away, and turns out to be the grey of something less vital than paint. Czech artist Pavel Büchler made this work in 2017 using only dust. A tiny filament stands just proud of the surface, turning the work into sculpture.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/aug/13/the-weight-of-words-henry-moore-institute-leeds-review">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘It’s cheap therapy, innit!’: comedian Mawaan Rizwan on family, adulthood  and his brilliant new TV series

Comic Mawaan Rizwan has never taken to adulthood. His childlike way of exploring life’s complexities has won him legions of fans and a ‘trippy’ new BBC series that finds the funny in family drama – co-starring his mum<p>If one event has shaped Mawaan Rizwan’s approach to comedy to date, it was receiving advice from a clown, eight years ago on the outskirts of Paris. “I’d been doing quite straight standup until then,” the 30-year-old comic explains, “but I was bored. Then I got myself a place on a course run by this ancient clown teacher, Philippe Gaulier.”</p><p>Without industry contacts or time at drama school, Rizwan had long taken every opportunity that might help him carve out a creative career. So he turned up at the prestigious <a href="https://www.ecolephilippegaulier.com/" title="">École Philippe Gaulier</a>, unsure what awaited him. “There were 30 students. We were taught how a circus is full of acts with skills and props, but the clown can only turn to their own idiocies and vulnerabilities. And Gaulier would always turn specifically to me and say: ‘Mawaan, you don’t have to pretend to be stupid to make us laugh. You are naturally very, very stupid.’”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/aug/13/comedian-mawaan-rizwan-on-family-adulthood-and-his-brilliant-new-tv-series">Continue reading...</a>

Interested in the Mark Ronson school of producing slick, digitised versions of disco and soul, they earned a Mercury prize nomination for their eponymous 2014 debut<br />, and have since produced hit singles such as the strings-laden <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcsfftwLUf0">Busy Earnin’</a> and the funk-inflected <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-lWzQd_xeQ">Keep Moving</a>. Consistently upbeat and supremely commercial, Jungle’s tunes have made for energetic live shows as well as perfect background fodder for adverts by global brands like Peloton.</p><p>Their fourth album, <em>Volcano</em><em>, </em>continues the theme, with head-nodding 70s funk breakbeats (Dominoes), wistful, guitar-strumming soul (Back on 74) and euphoric disco choruses (Every Night), all ripe for radio play. It’s confidently produced, but Jungle’s consistency leaves their record sanitised, lacking the grit and yearning emotion that makes disco and soul so enduring. There are gestures towards something deeper –<em> </em>rapper Roots Manuva rattling his baritone at the end of You Ain’t No Celebrity, or the harsh, thumping bass of Holding On – but largely, <em>Volcano </em>trades on Jungle’s same, safe formula. There is little new in the nostalgia of these 14 tracks.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/13/jungle-volcano-review-slick-safe-and-ripe-for-radio-play">Continue reading...</a>

Yet the nu-metal elders transform this elegant <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/feb/02/hike-yorkshire-happy-valley-calderdale-halifax-todmorden-walk">Calder Valley</a> market hall into a cauldron of irresistible new-millennium noise.</p><p>Back in 2000, the Jacksonville quintet’s third album, Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water, made them one of the biggest bands on the planet, and Fred Durst one of the most contentious characters in music. The band caught some retrospective flak again last year after the release of Netflix’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/03/netflix-trainwreck-woodstock-99-review-the-festival-documentary-that-feels-like-a-disaster-movie">Trainwreck: Woodstock 99</a> – a docuseries capturing the carnage of that doomed festival. They were accused of inciting riots during their performance, though Durst has maintained his band’s innocence, saying the organisers were looking for a scapegoat. “All drinks are free for the next 45 seconds but water’s $10,” he quips tonight, in an apparent reference to the festival’s infamously inflated prices.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/13/limp-bizkit-review-piece-hall-halifax-nu-metal">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The photographer’s new book documents a successful campaign to block a development at Crystal Palace Park. The bestselling author, who joined the protest, argues its spirit is more vital than ever</p><p>The main thing I remember about the protest camp at Crystal Palace was its proximity to the transmitter tower, which gave everyone headaches and was believed to be responsible for a mildly dystopian atmosphere on site. I was only there for two days, travelling up with other activists from Brighton in response to an alert of a possible eviction. My friend Tom and I spent the night in a treehouse, wearing climbing harnesses inside our sleeping bags, throbbing with adrenaline. We were braced for the arrival of police vans and cherrypickers, used to drag protesters from the trees. I don’t remember sleeping much, though by dawn it was obvious it had been a false alarm.</p><p>The camp was established in 1998 to protect five hectares (12 acres) of parkland from destruction for a proposed £56m leisure complex. Its enticements included a 20-screen cinema and parking for more than 1,000 cars, necessitating the elimination of 200 mature trees. Local people opposed to Bromley council’s plans for their cherished park had raised £35,000 for a judicial review to overturn the planning process. When the high court rejected their case, protesters stepped in to protect the site.</p><p>Matthew Williams, known as General Survival, left school when he was nine to become an eco warrior and lived in the treetop house with his mother and older brother.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/13/eco-warriors-london-1998-1999-janine-wiedel-olivia-laing-crystal-palace-protest-camp">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Almeida, London</strong><br />This huge community collaboration tries to put a positive spin on the difficulties of ageing, helped by a wonderfully rebellious script</p><p>In <em><a href="https://almeida.co.uk/whats-on/24-day/">24 (Day): The Measure of My Dreams</a></em>, the stage is thronging with participants as if there had been a coup at the Almeida – community theatre as it ought to be. The show centres on Islington in north London, and writer Annie Jenkins and director Jack Nurse have pulled off an exuberant celebration of – and with – its residents. They have collaborated with organisations such as <a href="https://www.allchangearts.org/">All Change</a>, <a href="https://cardboardcitizens.org.uk/">Cardboard Citizens</a> and <a href="https://www.arsenal.com/community">Arsenal in the Community</a>, and the pair have form: they were involved in the Almeida’s admirable <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/13/nora-a-dolls-house-royal-exchange-manchester-review-the-key-workers-cycle-almeida-legacy-maria-friedman-menier-chocolate-factory">The Key Workers Cycle</a> in 2022.</p><p>This is a feelgood story with sadness at its core. Liz, in her 70s, is married to Eddie, who lives with dementia (touchingly informed by the real experience of “Stephen”) and has moved into Highbury House care home. We meet her as she attends a hospital appointment where, in a reversal of what you might expect, she keeps an NHS radiographer waiting with her nervy chat. We have to wait, too, before hearing that cancer has spread to her bones.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/13/24-day-the-measure-of-my-dreams-almeida-community-theatre-review-a-feelgood-story-with-sadness-at-its-core">Continue reading...</a>

## Haunted Mansion review – theme park ride spinoff gives up the ghost

<p>Justin Simien’s chiller based on a Disney attraction is a grimly efficient intellectual property cash-in that’s devoid of scares</p><p>This latest version of <em>Haunted Mansion</em> is the second film (after an Eddie Murphy-starring 2003 version) to be based on a Disney theme park ride that has also spawned a Muppet Halloween special, a comic book series and a video game. And if you’re wondering what inspiration could possibly still be eked out of this already thoroughly plundered property, the answer is not a whole lot.</p><p>LaKeith Stanfield stars as Ben, a grieving widower and an astrophysicist turned New Orleans tour guide. Rosario Dawson does battle with malign spirits and an equally antagonistic wig in the role of Gabbie, the single mother who, along with her quirky, lonely little boy, moves to Gracey Manor in New Orleans. Gabbie and Ben find themselves trapped in the mansion, along with several hundred ghosts and a chillingly dead-eyed and phoned-in performance from Owen Wilson. This is a grimly efficient IP cash-in that defuses any potential scares with a hot-pink colour palette and a bunch of oddly specific and distracting product placements.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/13/haunted-mansion-review-theme-park-spinoff-gives-up-the-ghost-lakeith-stanfield-owen-wilson-rosario-dawson">Continue reading...</a>

The council that commissioned her is, it seems, utterly delighted with the result. “We want young creative people to get a little bit of the Keith and Mick spirit and pursue their dreams,” said Jeremy Kite, the leader of Dartmouth borough council, as locals slowly took in the pair’s bronze vests, their outsize pouts and pointedly splayed legs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/aug/13/gimme-sculpture-new-statues-of-jagger-and-richards-are-a-dud-but-here-are-eight-of-britains-best">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Elite former agents Gal Gadot, Jamie Dornan and Alia Bhatt are parachuted into dazzling locations around the world in this high-action Netflix romp</p><p>Who watches the watchers? Who offers covert support to the unwitting secret services when they get themselves into scrapes? According to Tom Harper’s uneven but enjoyable high-tech espionage action romp, there’s a mysterious organisation known as the Charter, controlled by an all-seeing supercomputer and made up of elite former agents, which swoops in to tidy up where governments, security agencies and rogue entities have made a bit of a mess of things.</p><p>And if that all sounds a bit <em>MI</em> does AI, that’s presumably the point. There’s very little that’s original in this Bond-alike adventure, which has a fine time of it parachuting ace hacker Rachel Stone (Gal Gadot), MI5 veteran Parker (Jamie Dornan) and computer prodigy Keya Dhawan (Alia Bhatt) into various stunning locations around the world (Reykjavik takes the most punishment). The screenplay is a rudimentary thing – scaffolding to support the set pieces – that starts to creak whenever it attempts any depth of character. But the action is terrific, with a screaming, tyre-shredding extended car chase around Lisbon’s tight, cobbled alleys a breathless and exhilarating highlight.</p><p>In select cinemas and <a href="https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81416533">on Netflix</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/13/heart-of-stone-review-tom-harper-gal-gadot-jamie-dornan-uneven-but-enjoyable-bond-alike-adventure">Continue reading...</a>

No one is ordinary when you get to know them<p>This summer I became a teacher, which would have sat badly with all the teachers who told me I’d never amount to anything. I’ve been teaching life writing all over the place: bouji retreats, online classes, university courses and festivals. A lesser mind would buckle under the responsibility of the job, the fear of having nothing to say. But as I remind the sallow face in the mirror every morning as I slip a Berocca under each eyelid: baby’s gotta make that cheddar. Also baby’s gotta get significantly better at paperwork.</p><p>I love my subject, which helps. The confessional form is the genre <em>de nos jours</em>. It’s elastic, taking in literary memoir, journalling, personal essays, even autofiction and Instagram captions. Of course, any life in writing is lucrative and glamorous. As I upcycle a heap of final-demand energy bills into makeshift toilet paper, I rally.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/13/rhik-samadder-what-i-leant-teaching-life-writing-lessons">Continue reading...</a>

This year, Nat McCleary’s <strong><a href="https://www.eif.co.uk/events/thrown">Thrown</a></strong> shows very different Scottish faces. Look, no men!</p><p>Johnny McKnight’s snappy production begins with women hurtling across the stage in satin fighting gear, but though the play is full of jousting for position, its focus is on cooperation. Uniformity is the opposite of the point as a group of females gather to learn how to do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_backhold">backhold wrestling</a> in preparation for the Highland Games. Imogen is rich and black and mourning her twin sister; Chantelle is poor and white, struggling with memories of her alcoholic mother, avid for leopard-skin leggings and a small dog that won’t go out of fashion. Jo’s Jamaican mother is dead; she has a white father, knows Gaelic and is aiming for a job in London; Chantelle, her oldest girlfriend, calls her Coco Pop. Helen is white and elderly (when she turns up for practice she is told “the knittin group is in the next room”) and always wanted to be a wife. The white coach (Lesley Hart is particularly strong) roars about clearing energy channels and is not sure whether she feels more male or female.

<p>If departing the EU has failed to deliver, why is the UK still so divided? Seven years on, we ask behavioural psychologists if cognitive dissonance can be overcome</p><p>One of the most significant political events of the past few months, it has seemed to me, wasn’t strictly a bit of politics at all, but an emotional catch and quaver in the voice of a politician. The politician was the Conservative MP Steve Baker and the sudden sob in his throat came about during a TV interview about the efforts to resolve the Northern Ireland protocol.</p><p>Baker, you will recall, was one of the most strident voices in the Brexit argument, a leader of the Tory European Research group, the ERG, which frustrated Theresa May’s efforts to find a compromise deal with the EU. The sob in his voice and the tears in his eyes prefaced a short, heartfelt confession about the extreme private stress that those Brexit machinations – and subsequent arguments over Covid lockdown – had caused him. Speaking subsequently to the <em>Times,</em> Baker expanded on that state of mind. “I felt absolutely worthless,” he said. “I felt repugnant, hateful, to blame for all of the troubles that we had, absolutely without any joy, constantly worried about everything to the point of mental torment. A constant state of panic attacks and anxiety. It’s not a state anyone should live in.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/aug/13/brexit-brain-science-psychology-divided-uk-debate">Continue reading...</a>

<p>UK households are under pressure at a time when charities are needed more than ever but there are still ways to contribute</p><p>Many charities have had a tough time of it during the cost of living crisis. It is clear that lots of people still want to support good causes, and that charities and voluntary organisations are needed more now than ever. But it is also clear that there is less money and time to go round.</p><p>The Benefact Group’s <a href="https://benefactgroup.com/fundraising-resources/charity-fundraising-articles/value-of-giving-report/">value of giving report</a> for 2022 showed that, although more people donated to charity last year, they gave less.

<p>String of vacancies at regional arts venues grows as funding and staffing crisis worsens</p><p>Running a theatre has become a seriously unappealing job, according to many of those working at Britain’s performance venues. While larger institutions, such as the Barbican, RSC and National Theatre, can still attract and keep good artistic directors, regional theatres and arts centres are struggling. A job heading of one of these offers the same stress, accountability and long hours, but on a smaller budget and with a smaller salary.</p><p>Burnout and disillusionment are now widespread, according to insiders including dancer Kenneth Tharp, who ran The Place, near London’s Euston station, until 2016. Last week, Tharp pointed out on Twitter (now known as X), that there had been a “huge churn of artistic directors (some after relatively short tenures)”, citing 14 venues in the past two years.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/13/worry-as-uk-theatre-bosses-quit-in-droves">Continue reading...</a>

It’s not the generation gap that counts: setting boomers against the younger cohorts just masks inequality<p>When did we start to think of society primarily as a collection of age cohorts? Take any recent attempt to capture the people of Britain and we tend to be shown a block strafed with three great horizontal divides: one canyon between 58- and 59-year-olds (generation X and boomers), a second great rift between the ages of 42 and 43 (millennials and gen X), and yet another unbreachable gap between 26 and 27 (gen Z and millennials).</p><p>Within each block, by contrast, you will be told that a group encompassing some 15 years and all levels of society is practically homogenous. Members of generations are accorded the same agenda, the same set of advantages and disadvantages, and even – like a new branch of astrology – the same personality. “I’m not a millennial,” a friend told me recently, though his date of birth put him smack within that cohort. What he meant, it turned out, was that he thought of himself as a stoic.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/13/millennials-dont-all-suffer-alike-what-really-divides-them-is-privilege">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In a daring mixture of memoir, fiction and fact, the Stasiland author re-examines the short life of George Orwell’s first wife, Eileen O’Shaughnessy, in an effort to give her a voice</p><p>In the summer of 2017, Anna Funder found herself sinking under the weight of a to-do list that would be familiar to any working mother: three children; house repairs; elderly relatives; visiting family – all with “work deadlines ticking under every waking minute”. Seeking respite from this domestic “peak overload”, Funder – a human-rights lawyer whose first nonfiction book, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jun/20/features.review1">Stasiland</a></em>, won the Samuel Johnson prize in 2004 and whose novel <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/16/all-i-am-anna-funder-review">All That I Am</a></em> was shortlisted for the Impac Dublin award and the Commonwealth Book prize – is drawn back to George Orwell, a writer she has “long loved”. She turns to Orwell’s life and work in the hope of boosting her own flagging writerly mojo, but her attention snags unexpectedly on a previously unremarked absence: the figure of his wife, Eileen O’Shaughnessy. “How is it that she remains invisible?”</p><p>There are numerous difficulties in bringing Eileen back into focus, Funder soon discovers. The most obvious is that her achievements and contributions have been consistently downplayed or omitted, not only by the six major biographies of Orwell (all written by men), but by Orwell himself, both in his published works and his private notebooks.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/13/wifedom-by-anna-funder-review-mrs-orwell-comes-up-for-air">Continue reading...</a>

Private cross-party meetings for politicians worried about the erosion of sex-based rights encouraged the Labour leader to start speaking up at last<p>Did Keir Starmer finally realise what being a leader meant this summer? No, not the Labour leader’s heroic <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/holidaying-keir-starmer-helps-find-30684672" title="">rescue of a lost dog</a> while on holiday, but his decision to enter the bitter gender debate and back a reversal of his party’s policy on allowing people to self-declare a new gender identity on official documents.</p><p>For the past few years, Starmer has largely avoided talking about it, save to complain that the debate is “too toxic”. It certainly has far too much poison in it, but Starmer is one of the people with the most power to change that by coaxing the debate in a better direction. It’s just taken him a while. There has been a visible change in the party since its national policy forum dropped the self-identification policy in July. Its MPs and activists now say they feel more confident in saying biological sex is important, after years of fearing a furious backlash from across the party.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/13/keir-starmer-gender-politics-labour">Continue reading...</a>

## Lip oils: 10 of the best

The new hero product moisturises and hydrates while offering a glossy finish<p>The beauty market is saturated with products for your lips: lipsticks, lip gloss, lip balm and lip masks, to name a few. But how do you know which one is the best for you? Let me introduce the new hero product, the lip oil. Lip oils have become popular, gaining attention for their ability to moisturise and hydrate while offering a glossy finish. Brands like Dior have waved the flag for this shift with their sell-out glow oil. Unlike traditional balms, lip oils are formulated with nourishing oils such as jojoba or argan, which provide long-lasting hydration. They’re also an excellent alternative for those who don’t like the sticky feel some lipglosses can leave – we all had that phase as teenagers, so let’s not repeat it. Some lip oils come with added benefits, such as plumping or anti-ageing properties. They are best for people who prefer a natural, dewy look over a matte finish. Overall, the lip oil is a great addition to any beauty routine for those who want to keep their lips hydrated and glossy but still chic.</p><p><strong>1.

<p>She cancelled her honeymoon to star in A Streetcar Named Desire with four days’ notice – then won the 2023 Critics’ Circle best actress award. She talks to the Observer’s theatre critic, an early champion, about her next move</p><p>Patsy Ferran is now most celebrated for a theatrical coup. Stepping tremendously into the lead role in <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jan/22/a-streetcar-named-desire-almeida-review-rebecca-frecknall-paul-mescal-patsy-ferran-anjana-vasan-watch-on-the-rhine-donmar-ellen-mcdougall-patricia-hodge">A Streetcar Named Desire</a></em> days before opening at the Almeida in January this year, she became, alongside Paul Mescal, part of a production which broke ticket-sales records – and dismantled the traditional idea of a classic heroine. Her professional debut nine years earlier was equally striking. In March 2014 London’s Gielgud theatre was crammed with fans of 88-year-old Angela Lansbury, appearing in <em>Blithe Spirit</em> as Noël Coward’s gargoyle ghost hunter. Then the maid came on, swivelling in all directions, wildly loopy and alarming. Ferran made the tiny part a focus for the spookiness of the play. It was as if spirits had unwired her. Yet perhaps it was she who was doing the unwiring? She looked as if she was hoovering up the ectoplasm.</p><p>Such physical fluency is rare on the British stage, where actors are more likely to be distinguished by vocal elasticity. Ferran’s particular talents – she won the Critics’ Circle award for best actress this year for <em>Streetcar</em> and for best newcomer in 2015 – are also evident off stage. As we talk, her hands are winging away in their own conversation. She could have done this interview wordlessly.

Britain depends on the kindness of strangers to get by in the world. It doesn’t have to be like this<p>Britain has its back against the wall to an extent unparalleled in its peacetime history. In all the other financial struggles we have faced – the currency crises of 1931, 1949, 1976 and 1992 – we could fight our way out by belt-tightening and devaluing the pound within a structure of secure trading relationships, anchored first by empire and later the EU.</p><p>Our international assets exceeded our liabilities by a huge degree. Our national debt was well structured, built on long-term bonds whose servicing requirements were always manageable. We retained great industrial strengths. We were fundamentally creditworthy. Even when the financial crisis broke in 2007/8, the low national debt meant the country could put its balance sheet behind its banks and bail them out.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/13/uk-stop-kidding-ourselves-rich-nation-gone-bust">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Labour chair of the standards committee can rub people up the wrong way with his pomposity, but his manifesto for restoring decency to parliament is nothing if not reasonable</p><p>How rotten is our democracy? <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/aug/05/labour-chris-bryant-interview-code-conduct-book">Chris Bryant</a> knows better than most what the answer should be to this. The chair of the House of Commons standards committee gave an impassioned speech about the importance of integrity when MPs were debating whether to suspend Owen Paterson for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/oct/26/owen-paterson-faces-suspension-breaking-lobbying-rules">breaking lobbying rules</a> back in November 2021 – but he has long been concerned about the standing of parliament. In fact, as he reminds us in his new book, <em>Code of Conduct: Why We Need to Fix Parliament – and How to Do </em><em>It</em>, “the first motion I tabled as an MP in 2001 called for parliamentary reform”. This book is mostly concerned with how standards have disintegrated significantly since then, especially in the past three years of Conservative psychodrama. It is also one of those books that end up being called “part memoir, part manifesto”, as Bryant reflects on his time as an MP while also setting out his prescriptions to heal politics.</p><p>Bryant is an obsessive parliamentary pedant – the Westminster equivalent of those people who wear T-shirts declaring: “I’m judging your bad grammar.” In his first, considerably longer, book, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/04/parliament-biography-chris-bryant-review-westminster-history">Parliament: The Biography</a></em>, he wasted no time in correcting urban myths about the Palace of Westminster, writing with the bouncy satisfaction of someone who knows they know more than the reader that “the red lines in the carpet of the House of Commons are not two sword lengths apart and are a Victorian innovation”. But he also illustrates his points in this book using the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/sugababes">Sugababes</a> and <em>RuPaul’s Drag Race</em> – as well as the sort of biblical references you would expect from a former curate. At times, he goes into more detail than a reader who is concerned about good politics might care for, including on how a man of the cloth might become an MP.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/13/code-of-conduct-by-chris-bryant-review-a-parliamentary-pedants-plan-for-fixing-britains-politics">Continue reading...</a>

Nearly half of marriages in the UK end in divorce. It can be acrimonious, expensive and hard on family. But it also heralds a new start. Here, a dozen divorcees reflect on what they’ve lived through<p>Divorce is a harsh word, and a deceptive one. It sounds so clear cut, so final. But divorce, as all those who have been touched by it will know, is usually a long time coming. Its ripple effects are felt by everyone involved: children, friends and family, long after the decree absolute is signed. Some of those ripple effects can however be extremely positive, if and when the hurt and loss have abated. A shedding of old skin, bringing a redefined self into the world, looking to a new future.</p><p>It is the complexity of divorce that documentary photographer Harry Borden set out to explore in his new book <em>On Divorce</em>. In it he talks to 47 individuals, including his own son, about their experiences and the impact of “the split”. The end of Borden’s own marriage in 2009 was “absolutely horrendous”, at least initially. “I felt completely full of shame,” he says, “and really knocked off my path. My wife and I had been a very good team together. I was really lonely and felt like a failure.” But since then “a new and astonishing friendship” has blossomed with his former wife.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/aug/13/divorce-people-reflect-on-what-they-lived-through-harry-borden-photographic-essay">Continue reading...</a>

## Fair-weather vegans should remember it’s a diet, not a fad | Barbara Ellen

Sales are falling, partly because the ethics of meat-free food have been overlooked in the hunt for the next trendy lifestyle<p>At the risk of seeming unreasonable, may curses rain down on the fair-weather vegan. Vegan food sales are slipping.

Rightwing pressure on women to have more children has no place in a world facing ecological and social catastrophe<p>Kenan Malik’s article is an excellent expose of the rise in rightwing populism across the globe (“<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/06/conservative-calls-women-more-babies-hide-pernicious-motives" title="">Conservative calls for women to have more babies hide pernicious motives</a>”, Comment). Coercive pronatalism – pressures to compel women to have more children – inspired by nationalism, xenophobia, militarism or market fundamentalism is at an all-time high, and is a threat to reproductive rights everywhere. The decline in fertility rates is cause for celebration because it represents greater gender equality and greater reproductive autonomy in countries where it occurring.</p><p>This is a distant reality for the more than 250 million girls and women who do not have access to education, autonomy or reproductive health care services in order to decide whether and when to have children. A globally unified effort to elevate reproductive rights, not squash them for ideological agendas, is what is urgently needed. In addition, the billions of dollars going towards such coercive pronatalist policies would be better used towards climate mitigation efforts, rewilding, supporting an aging population and assisting the more than 1 billion people expected to become climate refugees in the coming decades. On a planet facing numerous ecological and social catastrophes, bemoaning a decline in national fertility rates is a reprehensible distraction.<br /><strong>Nandita Bajaj</strong>, executive director, Population Balance<br />Toronto, Canada<br /></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2023/aug/13/reproductive-rights-under-threat-observer-letters">Continue reading...</a>

## Grilling stuff: southern French red wines for barbecues

As the coals sizzle, these reds really come into their own - all you need now is some sunshine<p><strong>Château Capitoul, IGP Pays d’Oc, France 2021, £9, <a href="https://www.coop.co.uk/">The Co-op</a> </strong>Such has been the justified trepidation about wildfires in southern France this summer, with soaring temperatures and tinderbox leaves covering the forest floors, local authorities across the region had taken the very sensible decision to outlaw any outside cookery, especially, barbecues, when I visited in late July. No such problem in the UK in this thus-far limply damp summer, of course, and it’s a mildly consoling irony for chilly Britons that, should we ever get a weekend clear enough for a barbecue, southern French reds are among the best candidates to drink with smoky grilled meat. There’s something, certainly, about the grape varieties that the vignerons of Provence and the Languedoc-Roussillon use either alone or, more usually, as a blend, that,make for fundamentally savoury, herbal, spicy, brambly fruited combination wines that work so well with, say, rosemary and garlic-marinated, spit-roasted lamb. And in the juicy, youthful case of Château Capitoul, is fantastic value for money, too.</p><p><strong>Domaine Gayda Altre Cami Grenache Noir, IGP Pays d’Oc, France 2020, £26.99, <a href="https://www.cambridgewine.com/">Cambridge Wine Merchants </a></strong>The Château Capitoul brings together syrah, grenache and carignan, but each of them works on its own. A recent standout syrah from this vast winemaking region is the aptly named Domaine les Yeuses Syrah Les Epices, IGP Pays d’Oc 2020 (£12.95, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SDCellars/">South Down Cellars</a>) which has the classic Languedoc syrah combination of freshly milled black pepper spice and aniseed-infused berries and currants. Much of the best grenache in southern France, meanwhile, is found in the Pyrenean lands of the Roussillon towards the border with Spain, a part of France with a strong Catalan feel, hence the name of the gorgeous grenache that is Altre Cami (which means ‘another path’ in Catalan), a pure, polished, fragrant expression in both the 2020 and (just released) 2021 vintages.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/aug/13/grilling-stuff-southern-french-red-wines-for-the-barbecue">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This small Portuguese restaurant has a big heart – and serves fantastic seafood</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.lisbontapas.co.uk/">Lisbon Tapas</a>, 6 Church Street, Wrexham LL13 8LS (01978 362264). Small plates £5.75-£9.95, mains £14.95-£26.95, pastel de nata £4.10, wines (litre) from £19.95</strong></p><p>Sometimes the sheer likability of a place trumps everything. Yes, some of the bread may bear a striking resemblance to the low-GI stuff sold by one of the supermarkets. And you may not be entirely sure what the red pepper hummus is doing on the menu of an ostensibly Portuguese restaurant. But doubts like these can be quietly smothered by something else: not just the good dishes, of which there are a fair few, but also the intangibles; mostly the sense of a place that is genuinely pleased to see you, and wants you to have a nice time. And so to <a href="https://www.lisbontapas.co.uk/" title="">Lisbon Tapas</a>, pressed up against the imposing gates to St Giles’ church in Wrexham. It’s a small restaurant where silent video walking tours of the Portuguese capital play on TV screens, where the sturdy house white comes in chilled carafes at a price that reminds you what eating out used to be like, and where dinner ends with a free shot of one of those ill-advised liqueurs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/aug/13/jay-rayner-restaurant-review-lisbon-tapas-wrexham-a-very-nice-time">Continue reading...</a>

## The Observer view on Ron DeSantis, Shakespeare and sex: ‘Man, proud man… Most ignorant of what he’s most assur’d’ | Observer editorial

Application of the Florida governor’s ‘don’t say gay’ law has led to the banning of plays such as Romeo and Juliet in some schools<p>You imagine that Shakespeare might have had some fun with Ronald Dion DeSantis. The Florida governor is attempting to win the Republican nomination for the US presidency by first stoking nasty and divisive “culture wars”. His campaign would no doubt have been fertile ground for a writer who delighted in dramatising the self-destructive fallout of “vaulting ambition” and in ruthlessly exposing the “smile and smile and be a villain” strategies of grinning populists.</p><p>The latest application of the governor’s homophobic 2022 “Parental Rights in Education Act” – widely known as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/19/florida-education-board-approves-expansion-dont-say-gay-bill" title="">“don’t say gay”</a> law because it prohibits discussion of sexual orientation or gender identity in classrooms – has led some Florida school boards to remove Shakespeare plays from the curriculum and the library, in order to avoid anything “racy or sexual”. <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> has been deemed beyond the pale in this regard (and don’t get the governor and his book-banning minions started on the non-binary shenanigans in <em>Twelfth Night</em> and <em>As You Like It</em>). Floridian students will therefore no longer be free to spend enlightening afternoons pondering the textual notes to Mercutio’s various pieces of amorous advice to his pal, Romeo: “If love be rough with you, be rough with love. Prick love for pricking and you beat love down”; or, that favourite of school students down the ages: “If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark. /Now will he sit under a medlar tree,/ And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit/ as maids call medlars when they laugh alone./ Romeo that she were, O, that she were/ An open-arse, or thou a popp’rin pear.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/13/observer-view-on-ron-desantis-shakespeare-sex-censorship-florida-schools">Continue reading...</a>

## Ania Magliano: I Can’t Believe You’ve Done This review – the haircut that launched a thousand laughs

<p><strong>Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh</strong><br />Audiences will fall for upbeat stooge Magliano, who delivers a fun, well-wrought follow-up to last year’s sellout show – and ends on a perspective-shifting twist</p><p>When is a haircut not just a haircut? Ania Magliano’s new show spins off from one catastrophic trip to the hairdresser, when British reserve kept her stumm while her tresses were hacked ruthlessly from her head. So far, so likable lightweight standup fare, you might think – and you could say the same about most of Magliano’s show, which follows <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/06/ania-magliano-review-skilled-off-key-laughs-from-affable-rising-star">last year’s sellout debut</a>. An upbeat account of the self-reinvention she embarked on after her salon calamity, it makes no claim other than to share a few confidences and raise some laughs – until a late reversal, which invites us to reconsider the hour through a different lens entirely.</p><p>You could consider that a devious late grafting on of final-act gravitas. But to my mind, the twist is artfully accomplished by Magliano, investing (more) emotional significance into her hour at no expense of levity. Rather this than the heavy hearts on sleeves by which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/08/drew-michael-review-pleasance-dome-edinburgh">trauma comedy is often weighed down</a>. Yes, Magliano talks therapy, surgery and romantic disappointment in I Can’t Believe You’ve Done This – but with a light touch, and plenty of detours into relatable observational standup, about gossip and WhatsApp voice notes. There’s a dotty story about a threesome that never was, which paints our host as endearingly demure. There’s a section on her recent breast reduction procedure, which majors in beady curiosity about her surgeon’s motives, and climaxes in an arresting image of Magliano at the peak of both self-realisation and personal hygiene indignity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/13/ania-magliano-i-cant-believe-youve-done-this-review-pleasance-courtyard-edinburgh">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With history to be made a group of young players showed nerves of steel in the shootout to clinch a spot in the semi-final</p><p>Penalty shootouts are fastidiously prepared long before they arrive. Every player picks their target, hammering in practice shots again and again until the precise movement is etched into their muscle fibres. But with her name 10th on the list of 11 Matildas penalty-takers, Cortnee Vine did not really think she would have to step up.</p><p>Yet after 19 penalty kicks and the shootout score at 6-6, Australia’s eyes turned to the 25-year-old as she dutifully made her way to the spot.

<p>It’s not only creatives whose work can be fuelled by a bit of downtime</p><p>As a freelancer, I often have days when I just work for my employer. A story is assigned to me, I write professionally, impersonally, efficiently – and then I have days when I write for myself; I choose what I want to say and how, and who to send it to for publication.</p><p>One is productive. It consistently results in published work and payment. The other is hit and miss. Rejection and self-doubt abound. On those days, it’s tempting to procrastinate – take walks, do chores, text friends, read books ... Even when I write a story that I’m happy with, I can’t always give it an ideal home.
