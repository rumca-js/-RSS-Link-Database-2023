First and most important: <em>Installer</em> absolutely positively does not work without you. I\u2019m going to do my best to find great new stuff every week, but I\u2019m also hoping you\u2019ll tag me in funny posts, DM me hilarious memes, and email me (<a href=\"mailto:installer@theverge.com\">i...</a></p>\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/13/23828624/installer-newsletter-callsheet-nerf-lego-arc\">Continue reading&hellip;</a>\n  </p>", "link": "https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/13/23828624/installer-newsletter-callsheet-nerf-lego-arc", "date_published": "2023-08-13T12:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}]
