Trudo Lemmens, health law specialist, University of Toronto

“What was originally conceived as an exceptional practice in medicine has quickly become normalised” 

“Even before the law is set to be expanded to include mentally ill patients, we already have worryingly high numbers of people dying,” 

Argues that Canada's approach is far more permissive than comparator nations, including Belgium and the Netherlands. 

“We've failed to sufficiently safeguard against the medicalisation of ageing.”

The new law enacted last year stipulates that, starting in March, 2023, MAID will be expanded to include patients with mental illnesses.

First deaths expected 17th march 2024
