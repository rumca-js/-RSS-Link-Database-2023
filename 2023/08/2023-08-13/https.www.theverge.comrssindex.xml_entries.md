  <p id="d54S9o">Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a Threads post today that “<a href="https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/Cv5CV3-rMKb/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">it’s time to move on</a>” from Elon Musk’s cage fight antics. “We can all agree Elon isn’t serious,” he wrote, adding that the refusal of the X (formerly Twitter) owner to confirm a date and his offer to “do a practice round in my backyard instead” shows how unserious he is. </p>
<p id="EnhwP4">This followed a pair of screenshots of text messages between the billionaires that were posted to X today by user <a href="https://twitter.com/cb_doge/status/1690684441931239424">DogeDesigner</a> and, later, <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1690747345674137600">Musk himself</a>. The thread showed Musk offering a “practice bout” next week at Zuckerberg’s house, to which Zuckerberg responded by telling Musk that if he wants a “real MMA fight” he should train on his own and let Zuck know when he’s “ready to compete.” </p>

  <p id="JwtSeZ">Apple is reportedly testing an M3 Ultra chip with a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-08-13/apple-event-september-12-2023-apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-watch-x-later-ll9geb3n">significant CPU bump</a> from 24 cores in the M2 Ultra to 32 cores in the next generation version of the chip, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>’s Mark Gurman in today’s <em>Power On </em>newsletter. Developer logs reportedly also show a base configuration with 64 GPU cores and a top-end version with 80 GPU cores for Apple’s big desktop chip. </p>
<p id="ipDvID">You can get an M2 Ultra Mac with a 60-core or 76-core GPU right now, making the next version of the chip a more modest improvement, from a graphics-processing standpoint, versus last year’s leap. The M2 Ultra at its top configuration saw a 12-core jump from the 64-core GPU of a maxed-out M1 Ultra Mac Studio. </p>
<p id="qdspjG">That’s not to say computers with the new chip will be creaky...</p>

Instead, Apple is working on a thinner “Apple Watch X” with magnetic watch band attachment points, a blood pressure sensor, and a microLED screen either in late 2024 or even 2025, Gurman says. </p>
<p id="vYrdmH">The old mechanical attachments of all Apple Watches so far have been great for allowing customers to reuse their old bands for years, but Gurman says they eat up space the company could use to shrink the wearable and beef up the battery and internal components.

  <p id="rqZ398">Hi friends! Welcome to the first-ever edition of <em>Installer</em>. My hope here every week is to be your guide to all the best and <em>Verge</em>-iest stuff in the world. My original pitch for this was just “what if we just found all the cool apps/videos/creators/whatevers every week and put it all in one place,” and that’s what <em>Installer</em> is here to be.</p>
<p id="4wRHsd">Normally, these won’t start with a long preamble about How It All Works, but seeing as we’ve never done this before, I’ll try and explain things as we go. First and most important: <em>Installer</em> absolutely positively does not work without you. I’m going to do my best to find great new stuff every week, but I’m also hoping you’ll tag me in funny posts, DM me hilarious memes, and email me (<a href="mailto:installer@theverge.com">i...</a></p>
