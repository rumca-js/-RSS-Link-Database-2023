As arguably the fastest player the league has ever seen, the running back forever known as CJ2K was a one-man highlight reel, turning would-be six-yard gains into 50+ yard touchdowns all season long. But if you watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz_rH2irras&amp;ab_channel=SportsProductions\">those highlights</a>, you'll find a common theme: Titans wideout Kenny Britt was so often downfield blocking, creating vital running lanes through which CJ would weave with his unrivaled quickness. Britt is an unsung hero of CJ's historic season. In <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/madden-nfl-24/\">Madden 24</a>, it's been great to find players can now enjoy similarly helpful downfield blocking like never before. This fix to the running game is precisely the sort of tangible improvement I hope for with every new Madden game. But examples such as this are overshadowed by a lack of major additions to Madden's suite of features and modes.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">That improvement to blocking has been a minor bullet point of EA's marketing in the run-up to release and is known as the Tactical Blocking System, essentially referring to an overhaul of how the AI linemen and other blockers target which defenders to remove from the play. This is easily my favorite new toy in Madden as its changes are apparent and make the ground game, or running after the catch, much more lifelike than before. But the publisher didn't hype up this change as much as others. Instead, EA buried this highlight behind two returning features: minigames and Superstar mode.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In neither case is their return nearly as helpful or interesting as some of the on-field tweaks. In the case of minigames, I find their return to be uneven at best. On one hand, a full Training Camp simulation that gives Franchise players a faster track to player improvements is at least rewarding, but the minigames themselves range from fun and clever to boring and simple. With bronze, silver, and gold medals correlating to XP earned for the player, it's worth playing for the XP attached to those awards, but some of the minigames are much better or worse than others.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/madden-nfl-24-review-one-yard-forward-two-yards-back/1900-6418106/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/madden-nfl-24-review-one-yard-forward-two-yards-back/1900-6418106/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-08-21T20:41:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Grab 33 Classic Children's Adventure Games For Just $45", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">If you were born in the '90s or early 2000s, chances are Humongous Entertainment's classic computer games are among your earliest video game memories, and thanks to recent ports and releases, the many tales of Putt-Putt the Car, Freddi Fish, Pajama Sam, and more are playable on modern PC operating systems and consoles, making it easy to share these child-friendly point-and-click adventures with the young gamers in your life.

And, skeleton CGI aside, it holds up very well. Slick, sleek and violent, Blade has style to spare. From the opening fight scene in the blood-soaked vampire club, to the final look at Blade hunting vampires in Moscow, every shot in the movie is framed like the splash page of a comic book.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The action, filled with slow-motion sparring and shooting, is more Hong Kongese than American, both in the way that it's filmed and in the way that it's cut together. Extended shots show off long sequences of punches, counters, and reversals that tell a story on their own, rather than being shoehorned between the exposition.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The movie received mixed reviews from critics at the time of its release, but the fans loved it, which resulted in two sequels. An MCU Phase Six reboot, starring Mahershala Ali as Blade, is currently scheduled to debut on February 14, 2025. Nothing says \"happy Valentine's Day\" like vampire mayhem.</p><p>Here are 17 Easter eggs and bits of trivia about Blade--a superhero film ahead of its time. Did we miss any good ones? Let us know in the comments. And while you're at it, take a look at what we <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/blade-movie-trivia-9-facts-you-probably-didnt-know/2900-2273/\">previously learned about the movie</a> from producer Robert Engelman and cast member Eric Edwards.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. Mom's ID</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4181228-1.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Early in the film, we see Blade's mother being brought to the hospital, after an attack by a vampire induces labor. If we pause the film, we can see from her ID that her full name is Vanessa Brooks.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This is different from Blade's origin in the comics; there, Vanessa is a pregnant brothel worker who goes into labor at the brothel. When the \"doctor\" arrives, it's actually Deacon Frost, who bites and infects her.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. Shannon Lee Cameo</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4181229-2.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The medical resident in this shot is played by Shannon Lee, the daughter of martial arts legend Bruce Lee.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. Traci Lords Cameo</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4181230-3.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Racquel, the woman who lures men into the vampire nightclub, is played by former adult actress Traci Lords. Between 1984 and 1986, Lords appeared in a number of adult films, with it only being revealed in 1986 that she was under age 18 while appearing in them. The films made during that time were banned in the United States. After her time in the adult film industry, Lords had roles in mainstream movies like Cry-Baby, Virtuosity, and Underworld. She also appeared on Married\u2026with Children, Roseanne, and Melrose Place.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. Dodge Charger</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4181231-4.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Blade's car is a modified 1968 Dodge Charger. The Dodge Charger has a long, proud history in American action cinema, starring in Cannonball (1976), the Dukes of Hazzard franchise, and most recently the Fast and Furious franchise.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. Hominis Nocturna</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4181232-5.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Whistler refers to the vampires as \"Hominis Nocturna,\" which roughly translates from Latin as \"Men of the Night.\"</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. Blade's Map</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4181233-6.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>We see Blade looking at a map of the city, and if we pause the film, we can see that the location is New Orleans.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. Crosses Don't Work</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4181234-7.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>We learn in the movie that vampires predate Christianity, and have been around for \"thousands of years.\" That explains why crosses \"don't do squat\" to vampires, despite popular folklore stating otherwise. It also broadens vampires to a more worldwide phenomenon, as opposed to only existing in a Westernized context.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>8. Director Cameo</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4181235-8.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Director Stephen Norrington cameos in this scene, where he plays a vampire who bites a woman in public.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>9. Chin Chin</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4181236-9.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The song that the Japanese schoolgirl band, Bang-Wa Cherry plays is called \"Chin Chin,\" which is Japanese slang for \"penis.\"</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>10. Pearl Costume</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4181237-10.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The massive Pearl costume took actor Eric Edwards about 45 minutes to put on--he had to coordinate getting into it with two puppeteers, who controlled the left and right arms.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>11. Mortal Kombat</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4181238-11.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The movie playing on the TV in Frost's Lair is Mortal Kombat (1995).</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>12. Cardboard Cutouts</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4181239-12.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The faces that we see in the subway are cardboard cutouts, except for one of them--digital animation supervisor Richard Baily has an uncredited cameo.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>13. Dead By Dawn</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4181240-13.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Wesley Snipes' one-liner in this scene is a reference to the Evil Dead franchise, which uses the phrase \"dead by dawn\" as a common callback. The full name for Evil Dead II (1987) is Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>14. Lobby Scene</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4181241-14.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The lobby scene in The Matrix (1999) shares some striking similarities with this scene, where Blade storms Frost's compound. Both include the SWAT armor-clad guards, the slow motion shooting, and the use of water to accentuate the action. They also both have high-octane techno music--originally, the Blade filmmakers wanted Prodigy to score the movie, but the band was unfortunately unavailable.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>15. Sexy Bite</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4181242-15.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The scene where Blade bites Karen has explicit sexual undertones. Sexuality has long been part of vampire lore, and similar to how Little Red Riding Hood was used as a cautionary tale for girls against predatory men, vampire tales were used as cautionary tales against sexual promiscuity. This scene subverts the trope and reimagines the vampire attack as a consensual act that intimately bonds the two participants.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>16. La Magra?</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4181243-16.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The movie's original ending had Frost actually turn into La Magra, a whirling dervish of blood. Due to negative test screening responses, they redid the ending with the Frost vs. Blade sword fight instead. The original ending is available on the physical media home releases.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>17. Body Count</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4181244-17.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>In total, 88 people and vampires die over the course of the film.</p></h3></p><br />", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/blade-25th-anniversary-17-easter-eggs-and-trivia-from-the-marvel-vampire-movie-classic/2900-4840/", "date_published": "2023-08-21T19:15:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Watch John Cena Shoot A Helicopter Out Of The Sky In New Movie Trailer", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Director Pierre Morel, known for Taken, is switching gears with his latest film, Freelance.

The sequel adds motorcycling, contextually destructible environments, and a revamped parry system to the katana-slicing, parkour-jumping, and wall-grappling formula of the original. You will also wander in the desert landscape outside the cyberpunk city of Dharma Tower. You can get a sneak peak at what this might look like, as well as some potential narrative teases in the new story trailer.</p><p>As you might expect, there are various <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2144740/Ghostrunner_2/\">preorder options</a>. The cheapest is the Base edition, which costs $40. Preorders will include two sword skins and two hand skins. The Deluxe edition retails at $50 and includes all the Base edition goodies plus four hand skins, four swords skins, and a personalized hologram displaying your username. The Brutal edition runs (no pun intended) at $70. All the previous bonuses are included and you can start the game 48 hours early on October 24.

Then again, so do bad things. If you need proof of that, take a look at the list of TV shows canceled every single year. In 2022, over 100 shows were either canceled or announced as ending. Some of them were excellent; others weren't so great and met their ends early. Now, in 2023, cancellations by networks and streaming services are off to a massive start.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">With the year still young, plenty of TV shows are already meeting their end. Some, like Vampire Academy, failed to attract the audience to necessitate a second season. Meanwhile, long-running shows like Mayans, Titans, and Doom Patrol have announced they are entering their final seasons.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">It can sometimes be hard to keep up with which shows have gotten the axe. Luckily for you, GameSpot has your back. Take a look below at all of the shows canceled or announced as ending in 2023 so far below. We will continue to keep this updated as the fates of more shows are announced throughout the year. And while you're at it, take a look at <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-110-tv-shows-canceled-or-ending-in-2022/2900-3928/\">everything canceled in 2022</a>, as well as a <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-20-netflix-tv-shows-canceled-in-2022/2900-3977/\">special look at what Netflix cut last year</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Don't be sad your favorite shows are leaving us--be glad you had them in the first place. And given that a lot of these are on streaming services, be glad you can continue watching them over and over again until your eyes bleed Hopefully, they don't get pulled at some point.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. 1899 (Netflix)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4091462-1899_s1_e3_00_38_54_03.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Premiered on: November 17, 2022</p><p>Canceled after 1 season.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2.

The version of the first Metal Gear Solid is apparently a straightforward port of the PlayStation version: resolution, aspect ratio, frame rate, and all.

In order to claim the ultimate prize, Luffy will have to assemble his own crew, find a ship that's seaworthy enough to sail the Grand Line, and outwit dangerous rivals seeking the same treasure he's after.</p><p>So far, the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflixs-one-piece-trailer-sets-sail-for-the-grand-line/1100-6516180/\">One Piece trailers</a> have teased a few of Luffy's antagonists from the early Manga arcs. McKinley Belcher III plays Arlong, a Fishman who pushes Luffy's rubber powers to the limit in the original arc, Captain Kuro and his knife-hands are teased in one shot, and Axe Hand Morgan can also be seen getting his metal jaw kicked in a brief scene.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-piece-documentary-shows-how-the-netflix-show-came-together/1100-6517015/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-piece-documentary-shows-how-the-netflix-show-came-together/1100-6517015/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-08-21T13:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Looks Like Konami Doing It Right", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Metal Gear Solid is one of the most renowned names in video games, and Konami knows it. Years after its reportedly acrimonious split from series creator Hideo Kojima, the publisher is paying homage to the series along two separate paths. Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, one of the most revered games in the series, is getting a remake subtitled Delta. But more presently, Konami is putting out the Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol. 1, a compilation of the classic MSX/NES games along with the first three games in the Metal Gear Solid series.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">While Konami is no stranger to compilations--having recently released Castlevania and Contra collections--it does certainly feel like the publisher knows it has something precious on its hands with Metal Gear Solid. As a result, this one is particularly reverent, packing in loads of historical artifacts while letting the games speak for themselves.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">To start, it's worth pausing to note just how many Metal Gear games this includes. The 8-bit Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2, along with the off-brand Snake's Revenge, together serve as a virtual museum of the series' deepest roots. The three MGS games are nicely preserved and given a clean and sleek UI menu to navigate the games and their various extras. The games themselves are essentially untouched, with a presentation similar to the PS3's HD Editions. There is a brief content warning at the start of every game, noting that some elements may be insensitive by today's standards, but other than that they appear to be direct transfers of the original content. Naturally, the UI has been touched up as well to correspond with the modern controllers. I played the compilation on Nintendo Switch.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-looks-like-konami-doing-it-right/1100-6517014/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-looks-like-konami-doing-it-right/1100-6517014/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-08-21T07:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}]
