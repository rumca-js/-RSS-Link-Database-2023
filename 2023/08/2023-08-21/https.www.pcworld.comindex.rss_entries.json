At least a few people, presumably, since Google and its manufacturing partners have made &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348040/google-unveils-a-wave-of-cloud-gaming-chromebooks.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">gaming Chromebooks</a>&rdquo; for a year or so. But with some screen upgrades and RGB keyboards, these machines are very clearly intended to be used with cloud services like GeForce Now, Xbox Game Pass, and Google&rsquo;s own ill-fated Stadia. It looks like more conventional gaming laptops, complete with dedicated graphics cards, were in the pipeline. Unfortunately, they&rsquo;ve now been unceremoniously axed in the early development process. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The news comes via developer commentary on <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/ec/+/4727767&amp;xcust=2-2-2037042-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Google&rsquo;s public Chromium Gerrit</a>. &ldquo;Clean house on some dead [mother]boards,&rdquo; writes the developer. &ldquo;Herobrine, Hades, and Agah are all canceled.&rdquo; As <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/chromebooks-with-nvidia-gpus-get-the-chopping-block-too/?expand_article=1&amp;xcust=2-2-2037042-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">About Chromebooks reports</a> (via <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/gaming-chromebooks-with-nvidia-gpus-apparently-killed-with-little-fanfare/&amp;xcust=2-2-2037042-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Ars Technica</a>), these codenames corresponded to motherboard designs destined for future ChromeOS-powered laptops or tablets, a frequent method for eagle-eyed Google fans to get a peek at upcoming hardware specifications. These three particular motherboards had discrete Nvidia laptop GPUs powering their graphics. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google has been working on <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/625264/heres-how-to-play-steam-games-on-a-chromebook.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">getting a version of Steam running in Chrome OS</a> for a while. The system is still in beta now, available to test out, but there&rsquo;s a reason that it hasn&rsquo;t graduated to the stable channel after nearly a year. Getting the complex Linux version of the software to play nice on typically low-powered Chromebooks is a bit of a headache, with the official documentation still listing issues with window placement, external monitors, UI scaling, audio and online chat, and Valve&rsquo;s ubiquitous Easy Anti-Cheat system. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/steam-on-chromeos/&amp;xcust=2-2-2037042-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Only twenty models get the official blessing</a> and external storage still isn&rsquo;t supported, a big problem when PC game installation sizes are exploding and Chromebooks might have as little as 64 gigabytes of onboard storage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, of course, the big hurdle is that lack of discrete graphics card support, which means games played locally must be limited to older titles or new games with extremely basic visuals. The abandonment of these in-development laptop motherboards doesn&rsquo;t automatically mean that Google&rsquo;s not interested in more Chromebook gaming in the future &mdash; AMD and Intel both make discrete graphics for mobile, after all. But if you&rsquo;re hoping to fire up <em>Baldur&rsquo;s Gate III</em> on your Chromebook anytime soon, you&rsquo;ll have to do it via the cloud. </p>\n\nChromebooks</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2037042/google-axes-chromebooks-with-discrete-nvidia-gpus.html", "date_published": "2023-08-21T14:51:49+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Save 37% on this MSI wireless gaming mouse and charging dock", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re looking to upgrade your gaming space with a new wireless mouse and charging dock, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place.

The current Chrome version is not even recognized by SafeErase 18, while, Firefox is partially recognized but not supported. Opera isn&rsquo;t recognized or supported either. This leaves the outdated, insecure Internet Explorer 11 and Microsoft Edge as the only browsers that delete data well like you&rsquo;d expect. The browser support is absolutely questionable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>At least the other things work</strong>. The annoying drag and drop bug of of SafeErase 17 when deleting files and folders is fixed now. Even in earlier versions of SafeErase, SSDs were given a special place: &ldquo;SolidErase&rdquo; works in a resource-saving way because only one write process is carried out on SSDs you&rsquo;re wiping.

And that&rsquo;s increasingly making them targets. Browser extensions, while incredibly popular for the tools and tweaks they add, are an easy vector to get spyware and other nasty stuff loaded onto your computer with minimal effort. Google&rsquo;s latest security measure in Chrome aims to make it easier to spot potentially malicious extensions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/extension-safety-hub/&amp;xcust=2-1-2036992-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Chrome developer blog</a>, Chrome version 117 will introduce a trio of new checks whenever a new extension is installed. It&rsquo;ll check to see if the extension has been removed from the Chrome Web Store by its developer or if it was removed manually for violating Google&rsquo;s extension policies or being marked as malware. Users will also be able to manually review the extensions they&rsquo;ve already installed via an alert in the &ldquo;Privacy and Security&rdquo; settings menu. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"chrome settings check now button\" class=\"wp-image-2037017\" height=\"310\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/chrome-settings-check-now-button.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"663\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Google</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The change won&rsquo;t affect the most common pain point for malicious extensions, those that are distributed and downloaded outside of Google&rsquo;s sanitized Chrome Web Store system. Such tools aren&rsquo;t always malware, but it&rsquo;s a frequent source of it, with Chrome extensions either mirroring legitimate ones with added payloads or designed to facilitate some kind of illicit activity. And finding an extension n the Chrome Web Store is no guarantee of its cleanliness, either &mdash; <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/443467/spammers-buy-chrome-extensions-and-turn-them-into-adware.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">extensions have been found loading up adware there</a>, usually when the original developer sells the tool to a new owner. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even so, the extra measures will be appreciated for anyone who wants an extra layer of browser (or in the case of Chromebooks, operating system) security. The new tools will debut for most users in the next Chrome update, but <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/google/google-chrome-to-warn-when-installed-extensions-are-malware/&amp;xcust=2-1-2036992-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">as Bleeping Computer notes</a>,, you can try them out in version 116 with some tweaks in the chrome://flags interface. </p>\n\nSecurity Software and Services</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2036992/chrome-will-warn-you-about-malware-infested-extensions.html", "date_published": "2023-08-21T13:31:14+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Is an 80 Plus Platinum-rated power supply overkill?", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>The 80 Plus rating is a voluntary certification for power supplies that indicates their efficiency and quality.

However, it&rsquo;s not an outright failure, as it&rsquo;s pretty lightweight for a 15-inch laptop.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Samsung has had great success with its Galaxy Book computers in recent years. Several of them have received top marks in my tests and I run the lively, luxurious and above all wonderfully light OLED 13-inch <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/693933/samsung-galaxy-book2-pro-360-review-a-thin-light-powerful-beauty.html\">Galaxy Book 2 Pro from 2022</a> as my own laptop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Galaxy Book3, released in late winter, doesn&rsquo;t have much in common with it, apart from the manufacturer and the name. This is a significantly simpler built computer that, despite a similar price, does not live up to my high expectations at all. It is indeed relatively thin and light, at least for a 15-inch computer, weighing only 3.46 pounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But where you usually see luxurious light metal chassis in Samsung&rsquo;s laptops, the Galaxy Book3 is a mix of aluminium and plastic. And it feels plasticky in the &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; places, like in the suspension and hinges for the screen, as well as in the unusually dumb keyboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, the keyboard is neat and tidy, with a compact numeric keypad on the side, and an on button with a built-in fingerprint reader in one corner, where it&rsquo;s not likely to be accessed accidentally. On the narrow sides are what I&rsquo;d call a standard set of external connections, two type c and two type a USBs, an HDMI port and a 3.5 mm common headphone and microphone port.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Looking for more options?

A compact mobile phone charger is included.

But it&rsquo;s one of the weaker ones, a Core i5-1355U, built for cooler and more power-efficient operation than for sustained high performance. It&rsquo;s great for browsing and running Office, but challenging it with high-resolution photo editing or video editing will be a challenge, and it can be a bit of a drag. Although it is possible. But with only two so-called performance cores to handle the most demanding processes, it&rsquo;s not ideal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The processor, with a moderate 15 watts of base power, does a good job of keeping power consumption down when it&rsquo;s not maxed out. A full working day of browsing, Excel work, emailing, and occasional video streams is enough for the battery without much trouble. And packing the small charger for emergencies is easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"samsung-galaxy-book3-display-audio\">Samsung Galaxy Book3: Display, audio</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A contributing factor to good battery life is an energy-efficient screen. It can light up to about 300 cd/m2, which isn&rsquo;t quite enough for daylight outdoors, but is more than enough for indoors. And if you turn down the brightness a bit, it doesn&rsquo;t strain the battery more than marginally. But then again, it&rsquo;s a pretty simple monitor. 1080p resolution, 60 Hz frame rate, and no great color space to speak of. It can handle just over 60 percent of the srgb color scale, so other than web and office graphics, the experience is limited.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Black surfaces are not as deeply black as some better IPS and PLS panels can manage, and there is some white point shifting at different viewing angles. However, if you don&rsquo;t have high demands on colour and dynamics, this is a pleasant, flicker-free screen you can spend many hours in front of.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Samsung Galaxy Book3 sk&auml;rm\" class=\"wp-image-2017711\" height=\"742\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/P_20230802_150436.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The screen is not a fun experience. Pale colours and mediocre viewing angles.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mattias Inghe</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The sound is also acceptable, but not in the higher divisions. It is pleasant, provides good stereo and good balance between bass, midrange and treble. But without much pressure in either. It drops out small details in music I play, and effects and rumbles in film trailers are reproduced correctly, but without any real weight. You can get audio enhancement with Dolby Audio, but it&rsquo;s off by default. Turning it on provides some equaliser control, but the hardware is the limit.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"samsung-galaxy-book3-galaxy-ecosystem\">Samsung Galaxy Book3: Galaxy ecosystem</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Samsung is keen to make the Galaxy Book computers part of its ecosystem of Galaxy mobiles, tablets and accessories. So there&rsquo;s a bunch of apps and features that enable this. You can quickly share media with other Galaxy devices, expand the screen of a Galaxy tablet, and control different devices from each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s smart and convenient if you have the right gadgets around. I tested several of the features with a Galaxy Z Fold 5 I have in for testing, and they work as promised. I still haven&rsquo;t figured out how to use them, but perhaps my lack of imagination is the limit.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Samsung Galaxy Book3 tangentbord\" class=\"wp-image-2017712\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/P_20230802_150547.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Number keys next to the regular keyboard.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mattias Inghe</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Samsung also has its own suite of programs that are intended to add value to the computer, but I&rsquo;m more doubtful about what they actually add. Samsung Gallery is an image viewing program where Windows already has two good ones. Samsung Studio Plus allows you to edit video, but the value of that add-on has diminished as Clipchamp is now part of Windows. I can also do without the search function and Bixby support. In any case, there is no significant bloatware in the computer, except for the frequent 30-day McAfee Livesafe, and an Amazon link. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"samsung-galaxy-book3-performance\">Samsung Galaxy Book3: Performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cinebench R23, CPU</strong>: 7,427 points<br /><strong>Cinebench</strong> <strong>R23, CPU and core</strong>: 1,661 points<br /><strong>Geekbench 6</strong>, CPU: 8,460 points<br /><strong>Geekbench 6, CPU and core</strong>: 2,223 points<br /><strong>Geekbench 6, GPU</strong>: 15,314 points<br /><strong>Disk read</strong>: 2,199.18 MB/s<br /><strong>Disk write</strong>: 1,194.66 MB/s</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"the-pricier-book3-ultra-is-a-beautiful-beast-of-a-laptop\">\n\t\t\t\t\tThe pricier Book3 ultra is a beautiful beast of a laptop\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"samsung-galaxy-book3-ultra\">Samsung Galaxy Book3 Ultra</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Samsung Galaxy Book3 Ultra\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"1039\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Samsung-Galaxy-Book3-Ultra-product.png\" width=\"1674\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__pricing-details  \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/321564/633495/10014?prodsku=6531072&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.bestbuy.com%2Fclick%2F-%2F6531072%2Fpdp&amp;intsrc=CATF_4831&amp;subid1=2-1-2030757-5-1515863-11290\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$2399.99 at  Best Buy</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p><em>This review was translated from Swedish to English and originally appeared on pcforalla.se.</em></p>\n\nLaptops</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2030757/samsung-galaxy-book-3-review.html", "date_published": "2023-08-21T10:30:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "SheetGPT is ChatGPT for Google Sheets and it\u2019s less than $50 now", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>By now you&rsquo;ve no doubt heard of ChatGPT.
