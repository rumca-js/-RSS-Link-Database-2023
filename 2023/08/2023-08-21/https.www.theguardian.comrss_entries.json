It doesn\u2019t matter: what\u2019s broken is the Home Office itself | Simon Jenkins", "description": "<p>Rishi Sunak is reportedly facing growing pressure to sack the home secretary. But the troubles go much deeper than that</p><p>If you had hired as many different builders in the past five years as Britain has hired home secretaries, you would assume your house was deeply flawed. Yet the latest, Suella Braverman, one of four in that time, has managed 10 months under Rishi Sunak and is <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/suella-braverman-must-go-tories-call-rishi-sunak-oust-home-secretary-reshuffle-looms-2557836\">reportedly</a> under pressure to be sacked. It is hard to imagine how a senior minister in a controversial department can operate when those around her think she is about to go. To put it mildly, the job should be held by someone with the authority to act. The habit of Boris Johnson and now Sunak of using cabinet jobs not as a reward for competence but in return for loyalty has been disastrous. The Home Office is not alone. In the past four years Britain has had six education secretaries and three transport secretaries. No wonder the British government is a mess.</p><p>Sunak\u2019s appointing of a hard rightwinger to the high-profile position of home secretary, just a few days after she had been forced to resign from the same post, might have been politically wise had there been a plausible policy in place.

That classic trope of games being a socially isolating experience, primarily within the purview of angry, pallid teenage boys, seems increasingly tired and outdated \u2013 because it is. Video games are no longer a niche, nerdy pastime. Much the opposite: they are one of, or perhaps <em>the</em> defining entertainment medium of the 21st century. <a href=\"https://explodingtopics.com/blog/number-of-gamers\">One estimate</a> puts the total number of people across the globe who play video games at 3.09 billion, with <a href=\"https://www.theesa.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2022-Essential-Facts-About-the-Video-Game-Industry.pdf\">data from the US</a> suggesting that two-thirds of American adults play them, with a fairly even split between men and women.</p><p>But, even though we\u2019ve moved past the most strongly negative characterisations of video games and become more accustomed to them, they\u2019re still viewed with a certain level of suspicion. And we\u2019re still presented with a seemingly endless cycle of scare stories in the news about their detrimental effects. I\u2019m a firm believer in the huge potential of video games as a force for good in our lives, and I\u2019ve <a href=\"https://iconbooks.com/ib-title/lost-in-a-good-game/\">written before</a> about the benefits they can have \u2013 their ability to connect us and to allow us to explore and understand our emotions and attitudes. Nevertheless, the broad-level discussion about their impact seems to be at an impasse: games are becoming ever more popular, while commenters are often stuck in a simplistic back and forth about whether they are good or bad for us.</p><p>Pete Etchells is a professor of psychology and science communication at Bath Spa University.
