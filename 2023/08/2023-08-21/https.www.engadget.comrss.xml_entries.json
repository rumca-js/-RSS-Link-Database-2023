The Wii U was languishing well in third place in the console wars and, after considerable pressure, the company was making its first tentative steps into mobile gaming with <em>Miitomo</em> and <em>Super Mario Run</em>. Fast-forward to today: The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-oled-review-130025998.html\">Switch</a> is likely on the way to becoming the company\u2019s best-selling \u201chome console\u201d ever, and seven Switch <em>games</em> have outsold the Wii U console. Everything\u2019s coming up Nintendo, then, thanks to the Switch\u2019s unique hybrid format and an ever-growing game library with uncharacteristically strong third-party support.</p><p>However, the Switch's online store isn't the easiest to navigate, so this guide aims to help the uninitiated start their journey on the right foot.

It streamlines many of the clunky aspects from earlier games and gives players plenty of motivation to keep shaping their island community. As you'd expect, it also looks better than any previous entry, giving you even more motivation to fill up your virtual home and closet. The sound design reaches ASMR levels of brain-tingling comfort. And yes, it certainly helps that <em>New Horizons</em> is an incredibly soothing escape from reality when we're all stuck at home in the midst of a global pandemic.</p><h2>Bayonetta 3</h2><p></p><p><em>Bayonetta 3</em> is a delicious amplification of the series\u2019 most ridiculous themes. It indulges in absurdity without disrupting the rapid-fire combat or Bayonetta\u2019s unrivaled sense of fashion and wit. <em>Bayonetta 3</em> is joyful, mechanically rich and full of action, plus it allows players to transform into a literal hell train in order to take down massive beasts bent on destroying the multiverse. Bayonetta elegantly dances her way through battles, dropping one-liners and shooting enemies with her gun shoes in one moment, and turning into a giant spider creature the next.</p><p>The Bayonetta series just keeps getting weirder, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s losing its sense of satisfying gameplay along the way. In the franchise\u2019s third installment, Bayonetta is powerful, confident and funny; she\u2019s a drag queen in a universe loosely held together by witchcraft, and the chaos of this combination is truly magical.</p><h2>Neon White</h2><p></p><p>Like all good games, Neon White is simple to learn, and difficult to master. The basic ask is that you vanquish every demon from a level and head to a finish marker. It plays like a fast-paced first-person shooter, with the complexity coming from your weapons, which are cards that can either fire or be spent for a special movement or attack ability. The real challenge comes from the scoring system, which grades you based on the time you took to complete a level.</p><p>There are just shy of 100 levels, all begging to be learned, repeated and perfected. Despite its first-person shooter visuals, it plays out more like a cross between Trackmania and a platformer. You'll quickly turn that bronze medal into a gold, and then an \"ace\" that is supposedly your ultimate target. Then you'll see the online leaderboards and realize you've left some seconds on the table. <em>Then</em> you'll randomly achieve the secret red medal on a level, say \"oh no\" and realize that there's a hidden tier of perfection for you to attain. <em>\u2013 Aaron Souppouris, Executive Editor</em></p><h2>Paramormasight</h2><p></p><p>If you enjoy visual novels, diverging storylines and maintaining a near-constant level of vigilance to everything a game tells you, <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/paranormasight-the-seven-mysteries-of-honjo-switch/\">Paranormasight</a> is a wild ride. <em>Paranormasight: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo</em> ties together nine (don\u2019t ask) Japanese folktales, spirits, curses and, well, ukiyoe block prints. You\u2019ll hop between multiple characters once you\u2019ve completed the tutorial-style first story, although you\u2019ll inevitably return to this one in the search of clues and hints. Even the style of presentation fits in with the Japanese Twilight Zone vibe. The illustrations have frayed red, blue and green outlines that imitate old TVs. You\u2019ll confront others who hold lethal curse powers creating anime-style stand-offs, as you either try to sneak your way out of danger or get other curse-bearers to fall into your trap. Eventually, it all comes together to a smart conclusion, and we hope there are further <em>Paranormasight</em> chapters to come. <em>\u2014 Mat Smith, UK Bureau Chief</em></p><h2><strong>Metroid Prime Remastered</strong></h2><p></p><p><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOVlaTlJRN1MvcmVmPW94X3NjX2FjdF90aXRsZV8xP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWRwLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0YzllYTc3Ny0yNGMyLTQ0YmUtOTM2ZC1iZDVhNTQ0MzVjY2YifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAcsTIIYT_EzC1pZtCiFpztOIDJvX5U3eD0K2v2Slvr9q&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB09YZNRQ7S%2Fref%3Dox_sc_act_title_1\"><em>Metroid Prime Remastered</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>modernizes one of Nintendo\u2019s greatest games, overhauling its models, textures and lighting for HD (while staying at a locked 60 fps) and adding a more comfortable dual-stick control scheme. It leaves the core game alone otherwise, which is a very good thing. <em>Metroid Prime</em> remains a masterwork in atmosphere, one that captures the wonder and isolation of encountering an alien world through someone else\u2019s eyes. Though there is some combat as bounty hunter Samus Aran, this is more of a first-person exploration game than a first-person shooter. Some 20 years on, slowing down and taking in the world of Tallon IV\u2019s details remains entrancing. <em>\u2014 Jeff Dunn, Senior Commerce Writer</em></p><h2><strong>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</strong></h2><p></p><p><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9LaXJieS1hbmQtdGhlLUZvcmdvdHRlbi1MYW5kL2RwL0IwOVJNTUJaQlI_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZHAtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjRjOWVhNzc3LTI0YzItNDRiZS05MzZkLWJkNWE1NDQzNWNjZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAARaSlNh6Z9nrYBIn5GPweF6Zh2rAiT1QQlXH4-qJudgK&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FKirby-and-the-Forgotten-Land%2Fdp%2FB09RMMBZBR\"><em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</em></a> brings Nintendo\u2019s lovable pink blob into 3D. Its structure is far less open and fluid than <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, but the game is similarly playful in spirit. The big hook is \u201cmouthful mode,\u201d wherein Kirby swallows and assumes the form of certain objects to get through specific stages. Apart from simply being amusing \u2013 enjoy \u201cCoaster-Mouth Kirby\u201d or \u201cBolted-Storage-Mouth Kirby\u201d \u2013 the way this repurposes ordinary materials and presents new sensations is delightful. \u201cPipe Mouth Kirby\u201d turns a pipe in a rolling cylinder of destruction, \u201cWater-Balloon Mouth Kirby\u201d turns you into a giant wobbly mass, and so on. While it starts recycling by the end, most of the game parades through new ideas in that classic Nintendo way. Though the story isn\u2019t Pulitzer stuff, its ending is wonderfully absurd. And like most <em>Kirby </em>games, it\u2019s breezy enough for folks of all skill levels but not a total cakewalk on the default difficulty. \u2014 J.D.</p><h2>Astral Chain</h2><p></p><p>I was on the fence about <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Bc3RyYWwtQ2hhaW4tTmludGVuZG8tU3dpdGNoL2RwL0IwN05RRjc0TTM_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZHAtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjRjOWVhNzc3LTI0YzItNDRiZS05MzZkLWJkNWE1NDQzNWNjZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAR3jcHvEHVPju10gNjSLwIo_zbdlzxjIKKSe76NJpQvv&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAstral-Chain-Nintendo-Switch%2Fdp%2FB07NQF74M3\"><em>Astral Chain</em></a> from the day the first trailer came out until a good few hours into my playthrough. It all felt a little too generic, almost a paint-by-numbers rendition of an action game. I needn't have been so worried, as it's one of the more original titles to come from PlatinumGames, the developer behind the Bayonetta series, in recent years.</p><p>In a future where the world is under constant attack from creatures that exist on another plane of existence, you play as an officer in a special force that deals with this threat. The game's gimmick is that you can tame these creatures to become Legions that you use in combat. Encounters play out with you controlling both your character and the Legion simultaneously to deal with waves of mobs and larger, more challenging enemies. As well as for combat, you'll use your Legion(s) to solve crimes and traverse environments.</p><p><em>Astral Chain</em> sticks closely to a loop of detective work, platforming puzzles and combat \u2014 a little too closely, if I'm being critical \u2014 with the game split into cases that serve as chapters. The story starts off well enough but quickly devolves into a mashup of various anime tropes, including twists and arcs ripped straight from some very famous shows and films. However, the minute-to-minute gameplay is enough to keep you engaged through the 20-hour or so main campaign and into the fairly significant end-game content.</p><p>Does <em>Astral Chain</em> reach the heights of <em>Nier: Automata</em>? No, not at all, but its combat and environments can often surpass that game, which all-told is probably my favorite of this generation. Often available for under $50 these days, it's well worth your time.</p><h2>Celeste</h2><p></p><p><a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9DZWxlc3RlLU5pbnRlbmRvLVN3aXRjaC1EaWdpdGFsLUNvZGUvZHAvQjA3OVoxTFBTUD90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1kcC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNGM5ZWE3NzctMjRjMi00NGJlLTkzNmQtYmQ1YTU0NDM1Y2NmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAWFejBQXp6O_1u7hRKhOJl3hSxgiqT92BCYIIYgHmpVz&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCeleste-Nintendo-Switch-Digital-Code%2Fdp%2FB079Z1LPSP\"><em>Celeste</em></a> is a lot of things. It's a great platformer, but it's also a puzzle game. It's extremely punishing, but it's also very accessible. It puts gameplay above everything, but it has a great story. It's a beautiful, moving and memorable contradiction of a game, created by MattMakesGames, the indie studio behind the excellent <em>Towerfall</em>. So, <em>Celeste</em> is worth picking up no matter what platform you own, but its room-based levels and clear 2D artwork make it a fantastic game to play on the Switch when on the go.</p><h2>Dragon Quest XI S: Echoes of an Elusive Age</h2><p></p><p><a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9EcmFnb24tUXVlc3QtWEktRWx1c2l2ZS1EZWZpbml0aXZlLU5pbnRlbmRvL2RwL0IwN05RR0RYUlk_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZHAtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjRjOWVhNzc3LTI0YzItNDRiZS05MzZkLWJkNWE1NDQzNWNjZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATtEkVVMJKVpot09mb9yKTD4LQufirePuQJHccNZsP8L&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDragon-Quest-XI-Elusive-Definitive-Nintendo%2Fdp%2FB07NQGDXRY\"><em>Dragon Quest XI</em></a> is an unashamedly traditional Japanese role-playing game. Most of the characters are established RPG tropes: mute protagonist-who\u2019s-actually-a-legendary-hero, sister mages, mysterious rogue and the rest. Then there\u2019s the battle system, which has rarely changed in the decades of the series. (There\u2019s a reason that this special edition features a 16-bit styled version of the game: The mechanics and story work just as well in more... graphically constrained surroundings.) While the story hits a lot of familiar RPG beats, everything takes an interesting turn later on. And through it, the game demands completion. RPGs require compelling stories, and this has one. It just doesn\u2019t quite kick in until later.</p><p>This eleventh iteration of the series also serves as a celebration of all things Dragon Quest. Without getting too deep into the story, the game heavily references the first game, taking place in the same narrative universe, just hundreds of years later.</p><p>The Switch edition doesn\u2019t offer the most polished take on the game \u2014 it\u2019s available on rival consoles \u2014 but the characters, designed by Akira Toriyama of Dragon Ball fame, move around fluidly, in plenty of detail despite the limits of the hybrid console. And while it\u2019s hard to explain, there\u2019s also something just plain <em>right</em> about playing a traditional JRPG on a Nintendo console.</p><h2>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</h2><p></p><p><a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9GaXJlLUVtYmxlbS1Ib3VzZXMtTmludGVuZG8tRGlnaXRhbC9kcC9CMDdETTdLRDRXP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWRwLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0YzllYTc3Ny0yNGMyLTQ0YmUtOTM2ZC1iZDVhNTQ0MzVjY2YifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAcEmBmuXrAF337sijYudHXk7PJvCm_WJALON4PEQBCKN&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFire-Emblem-Houses-Nintendo-Digital%2Fdp%2FB07DM7KD4W\"><em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</em></a> is a must-play game. Developer Intelligent Systems made a lot of tweaks to its formula for the series' first outing on the Nintendo Switch, and the result of those changes is a game that marries Fire Emblem's dual personalities in a meaningful and satisfying way. You'll spend half your time as a master tactician, commanding troops around varied and enjoyable battlefields. The other half? You'll be teaching students and building relationships as a professor at the finest school in the land.</p><h2>Hades</h2><p></p><p><a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9IYWRlcy1MaW1pdGVkLU5pbnRlbmRvLVN3aXRjaC9kcC9CMDhYMks2QjFaLz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1kcC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNGM5ZWE3NzctMjRjMi00NGJlLTkzNmQtYmQ1YTU0NDM1Y2NmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAARN3_44YA2YDwg5CRuQcGC5oNhErQG-MNoqunBPg3PYS&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHades-Limited-Nintendo-Switch%2Fdp%2FB08X2K6B1Z%2F\"><em>Hades</em></a> was the first early access title to ever make our best PC game list, and the final game is a perfect fit for Nintendo\u2019s Switch. It's an action-RPG developed by the team behind <em>Bastion</em>, <em>Transistor </em>and <em>Pyre</em>. You play Zagreus, son of Hades, who's having a little spat with his dad, and wants to escape from the underworld. To do so, Zagreus has to fight his way through the various levels of the underworld and up to the surface. Along the way, you\u2019ll pick up \u201cboons\u201d from a wide range of ancient deities like Zeus, Ares and Aphrodite, which stack additional effects on your various attacks. Each level is divided into rooms full of demons, items and the occasional miniboss.</p><p>As <em>Hades</em> is a \u201croguelike\u201d game, you start at the same place every time, with the levels rearranged. With that said, the items you collect can be used to access and upgrade new weapons and abilities that stick between sessions. <em>Hades</em> initially caught our attention just for its gameplay: You can jump in for 30 minutes and have a blast, or find yourself playing for hours. As the game neared its final release, the storytelling, world-building and its general character really started to take shape \u2014 there\u2019s so much to do, so many people to meet and even some romance stuffed in there. You could play for hundreds of hours and still have fun.</p><h2>Hollow Knight</h2><p></p><p>This was a real sleeper hit, and one of very few Kickstarter games to not only live up to but exceed expectations. <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Ib2xsb3ctS25pZ2h0LU5pbnRlbmRvLVN3aXRjaC9kcC9CMDdRSFhNM0pZP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWRwLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0YzllYTc3Ny0yNGMyLTQ0YmUtOTM2ZC1iZDVhNTQ0MzVjY2YifQ&amp;signature=AQAAASK479VKqSlkjjATizIaol_0AHoFXK1ZFdFESa_HNadL&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHollow-Knight-Nintendo-Switch%2Fdp%2FB07QHXM3JY\"><em>Hollow Knight</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>is a 2D action-adventure game in the Metroidvania style, but it's also just a <em>mood</em>. Set in a vast, decrepit land, which you'll explore gradually as you unlock new movement and attack skills for your character, a Burtonesque bug-like creature. Short on both dialogue and narrative, the developers instead convey a story through environment and atmosphere, and it absolutely nails it.</p><p>You'll start out feeling fairly powerless, but <em>Hollow Knight</em> has a perfect difficulty curve, always allowing you to progress but never making it easy. For example, it borrows the Dark Souls mechanic where you'll need to travel back to your corpse upon death to retrieve your \"Geo\" (the game's stand-in for Souls), which is always a tense time. Throughout it all, though, the enemies and NPCs will never fail to delight. For a moody game, it has a nice sense of humor and levity imbued mostly through the beautifully animated and voiced folks you meet. Given its low cost and extremely high quality, there's really no reason not to get this game. Trust us, it'll win you over.</p><h2>Into The Breach</h2><p></p><p>When is a turn-based strategy game not a turn-based strategy game? <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9JbnRvLUJyZWFjaC1OaW50ZW5kby1Td2l0Y2gtRGlnaXRhbC9kcC9CMDdIMlJDTEpYP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWRwLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0YzllYTc3Ny0yNGMyLTQ0YmUtOTM2ZC1iZDVhNTQ0MzVjY2YifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZ6A7FscFue0kj6YIjiivOsIamIRL74fBR7IQQLGJ5pb&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FInto-Breach-Nintendo-Switch-Digital%2Fdp%2FB07H2RCLJX\"><em>Into the Breach</em></a>, an indie roguelike game where you control mechs to stem an alien attack, defies conventions, and is all the better for it. While its core mechanics are very much in the XCOM (or Fire Emblem, for that matter) mold, it's what it does with those mechanics that's so interesting. A traditional turn-based strategy game plays out like a game of chess \u2014 you plan a move, while predicting what your opponent will do in return, and thinking ahead to what you'll do next, and so on, with the eventual goal of forcing them into a corner and winning. At the start of every <em>Into the Breach</em> turn, the game politely tells you <em>exactly</em> what each enemy character is going to do, down the exact square they'll end on and how much damage they'll inflict. There are no hit percentages, no random events, no luck; each turn is a puzzle, with definitive answers to how exactly you're going to come out on top.</p><p><em>Into the Breach </em>battles are short, and being a roguelike, designed to be very replayable. Once you've mastered the basics and reached the end, there are numerous different mechs with new attack and defense mechanics to learn and master as you mix-and-match to build your favorite team. If you're a fan of either puzzle or turn-based strategy games, this is a must-have.</p><h2>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</h2><p></p><p><a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDZXTExIWEM5P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWRwLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0YzllYTc3Ny0yNGMyLTQ0YmUtOTM2ZC1iZDVhNTQ0MzVjY2YifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAbqryi76xo7iqi0OSiZFdJ2qtoRw36MWbouVYggK6l2N&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB06WLLHXC9\"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild</em></a> signals the biggest shift in the series since the Nintendo 64's <em>Ocarina of Time</em>, and it might well be one of the best games of the past decade. It pulls the long-running series into modern gaming, with a perfectly pitched difficulty curve and an incredible open world to play with. There's crafting, weapons that degrade, almost too much to collect and do and a gentle story hidden away for players to discover for themselves. Even without the entertaining DLC add-ons, there's simply so much to do here and challenges for every level of gamer.</p><h2>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</h2><p></p><p><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9MZWdlbmQtWmVsZGEtS2luZ2RvbS1TdGFuZGFyZC1OaW50ZW5kby9kcC9CMEJYODU0SllaLz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1kcC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNGM5ZWE3NzctMjRjMi00NGJlLTkzNmQtYmQ1YTU0NDM1Y2NmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAWPjwUrgyhi8sycGkwFARF9PiunQPeZyJve7bTveeitj&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLegend-Zelda-Kingdom-Standard-Nintendo%2Fdp%2FB0BX854JYZ%2F\"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em></a> was a wild reinvention for one of Nintendo\u2019s most revered franchises, and it didn\u2019t take long for the company to announce it had a direct sequel in the works. The end result is <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, a game that remixes <em>BotW</em> in some completely unexpected ways. You\u2019re still exploring Hyrule and can travel to almost any point you can see, and there are still dozens of small shrines to clear and bigger quests you can tackle in any order you like.</p><p>But there\u2019s also a vast underworld as well as a mysterious sky world full of islands to explore, and these new locales provide fresh challenges and dangers distinct from what you find in Hyrule proper. And Link has several new skills to give him the upper hand, including, well, Ultrahand. This lets you grab almost anything and stick it to other objects, letting you build all manner of contraptions, both practical and absurd. Ultrahand opens up a huge variety of solutions to every puzzle you come across in the game, and the moment when you find the right solution to what\u2019s impeding you is even more satisfying than it is in past Zelda games. <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> simply takes just about everything that was great about <em>Breath of the Wild</em> and ratchets it up to the next level. <em>\u2014 Nathan Ingraham, Deputy Editor</em></p><h2><strong>Disco Elysium Final Cut</strong></h2><p></p><p><a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9EaXNjby1FbHlzaXVtLUZpbmFsLUN1dC1OaW50ZW5kby1Td2l0Y2gvZHAvQjA5UDRDSDFGQj90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1kcC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNGM5ZWE3NzctMjRjMi00NGJlLTkzNmQtYmQ1YTU0NDM1Y2NmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAQSloMMKVvqLiBVAHQD0T2YxWtZgpQ9TCSdEvIjiECHm&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDisco-Elysium-Final-Cut-Nintendo-Switch%2Fdp%2FB09P4CH1FB\"><em>Disco Elysium</em></a> is a special game. The first release from Estonian studio ZA/UM, it's a sprawling science-fiction RPG that takes more inspiration from D&amp;D and <em>Baldur's Gate</em> than modern combat-focused games. In fact, there is no combat to speak of, instead, you'll be creating your character, choosing what their strengths and weaknesses are, and then passing D&amp;D-style skill checks to make your way through the story. You'll, of course, be leveling up your abilities and boosting stats with items, but really the game's systems fall away in place of a truly engaging story, featuring some of the finest writing to ever grace a video game.</p><p>With the <em>Final Cut</em>, released 18 months after the original, this extremely dialogue-heavy game now has full voice acting, which brings the unique world more to life than ever before. After debuting on PC, PS5 and Stadia, <em>Final Cut </em>is now available for all extant home consoles \u2013 including Nintendo\u2019s Switch. Loading times are a little slower than on other systems, so it might not be the absolute best platform to play it on, but <em>Disco Elysium</em> is an experience unlike the rest of the Switch library, which is why it makes it on this list.</p><h2>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</h2><p></p><p><a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9NYXJpby1LYXJ0LURlbHV4ZS1OaW50ZW5kby1EaWdpdGFsL2RwL0IwMU4xMDM3Q1Y_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZHAtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjRjOWVhNzc3LTI0YzItNDRiZS05MzZkLWJkNWE1NDQzNWNjZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAW8YM_F6RFQfAdeTnF8fGsF8NAwrfCWh1NDrqu6ew53s&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMario-Kart-Deluxe-Nintendo-Digital%2Fdp%2FB01N1037CV\"><em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe's</em></a> vibrancy and attention to detail prove it's a valid upgrade to the Wii U original. Characters are animated and endearing as they race around, and Nintendo's made bigger, wider tracks to accommodate up to 12 racers. This edition of Mario Kart included gravity-defying hover tires and automatic gliders for when you soar off ramps, making races even more visually thrilling, but at its core, it's Mario Kart \u2014 simple, pure gaming fun. It's also a great showcase for the multitude of playing modes that the Switch is capable of: Two-player split-screen anywhere is possible, as are online races or Switch-on-Switch chaos. For now, this is the definitive edition.</p><h2>OlliOlli World</h2><p></p><p><em>OlliOlli</em> and its sequel, <em>OlliOlli 2: Welcome to Olliwood</em>, were notoriously difficult to master.

Developer Roll7 made a game that\u2019s significantly more approachable than the original titles \u2014 but one that keeps the twitch-response gameplay and score-chasing highs intact for those who crave them.</p><p>It\u2019s hard to sum up exactly what makes <em>OlliOlli World</em> so compelling, but the game mixes serious challenges with moments that let you really get into that elusive flow state, where you\u2019re just pulling off tricks, riding rails and generally tearing through a course without thinking too much about what you\u2019re doing. The music, sound effects, art style, level design and variety of moves you can pull off all contribute to this vibe \u2014 and even though the game looks entirely different from its predecessors, the end result is the same: skateboarding bliss.</p><h2>Super Mario 3D World + Bowser\u2019s Fury</h2><p></p><p><a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TdXBlci1NYXJpby0zRC1Xb3JsZC1Cb3dzZXJzLUZ1cnkvZHAvQjA4SkNaS1RRVz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1kcC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNGM5ZWE3NzctMjRjMi00NGJlLTkzNmQtYmQ1YTU0NDM1Y2NmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAARXXJoTVtkNmLtCudO6r_x5ITfcqG3hm0igXTYdBnGUH&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSuper-Mario-3D-World-Bowsers-Fury%2Fdp%2FB08JCZKTQW\"><em>Super Mario 3D World</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>was unfairly slept on when it originally launched in 2013, mostly due to the fact very few people had a Wii U. It's a superb translation of old-school retro Mario mechanics into 3D (<em>Mario 64</em> is a masterpiece, yes, but unless you're a speed-runner it doesn't quite have the pace of the NES and SNES games). It's also a great multiplayer game, as you can play in co-op mode with three other players and race through levels \u2014 the winner of each level gets to wear a crown in the next.</p><p>With the move to the Switch, and Nintendo finally starting to figure out online gaming, you can now do that remotely, which is a huge plus. The bigger addition is <em>Bowser's Fury</em>, an all-new game of sorts that plays more like a blend of <em>Super Mario Odyssey </em>and <em>3D World. </em>There are some really creative challenges that feel right out of <em>Odyssey</em>, blended with the lightness and speed of the Wii U game. (It should be noted that <em>Bowser's Fury</em> is also only good for one or two players, unlike the main game.) We'd recommend <em>3D World</em> just on its own, but as a package with <em>Bowser's Fury,</em> it becomes a much better deal.</p><h2>Super Mario Odyssey</h2><p></p><p><a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TdXBlci1NYXJpby1PZHlzc2V5LU5pbnRlbmRvLURpZ2l0YWwvZHAvQjA3MktHNDVKRD90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1kcC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNGM5ZWE3NzctMjRjMi00NGJlLTkzNmQtYmQ1YTU0NDM1Y2NmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAXw-FHdr-Y2SRpbBsHQF2m9yxlHshmkmrMS3o_D79zBp&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSuper-Mario-Odyssey-Nintendo-Digital%2Fdp%2FB072KG45JD\"><em>Super Mario Odyssey</em></a> might not represent the major change that <em>Breath of the Wild</em> was for the Zelda series, but it\u2019s a great Mario game that's been refined across the last two decades.

But that core joy of Mario, figuring out the puzzles, racing to collect items and exploring landmarks, is here in abundance.</p><h2>Super Smash Bros.

Ultimate</em>, ensuring thrilling battles (once you've sorted handicaps) for everyone involved.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-nintendo-switch-games-160029843.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-nintendo-switch-games-160029843.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-08-21T18:35:53+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The cozy cat game that escaped from Valve", "description": "<p>Imagine a game that might be described as the opposite of <em>Half-Life 2</em>,<em> Left 4 Dead</em> or <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em>. These are first-person shooters set in wartorn, post-apocalyptic cities, so their inverse might be a third-person game with no weapons at all, set in a warm, buzzing metropolis of friendly characters, maybe starring an adorable cat. Weirdly, the result could look a lot like <em>Little Kitty, Big City</em>, the first project from former Valve designer Matt T. Wood.</p><p>In nearly 17 years at Valve, Wood helped build and ship the company\u2019s most notable titles, including<em> Left 4 Dead</em>, <em>Left 4 Dead 2</em>, <em>Portal 2,</em><em>CS:GO </em>and both episodes of <em>Half-Life 2</em>. He was a founding member of the <em>CS:GO</em> project and worked on that series for six years; he was pivotal in crafting <em>Portal 2</em>\u2019s co-op mode, and he created choreography and combat scenes in Half-Life and Left 4 Dead. Level design was one of his specialties.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Wood left Valve in mid-2019, and today he\u2019s the head of his own game development company in Seattle, Washington, Double Dagger Studio. He didn\u2019t plan on starting his own studio post-Valve, and he certainly didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be building and self-publishing a game about an adorable cat. But, he is, and it's called <em>Little Kitty, Big City</em>.</p><p>\u201cIt really is more about cozy exploration,\u201d Wood told Engadget. \u201cThe game has aspects of platforming, but it's very light platforming. It's more about exploring vertically, and exploring nooks and crannies. I've done a lot of things throughout my career, but one of the things I spent a lot of time doing was level design in video games, so I have a lot of personal interest in creating spaces that feel fun to explore, to sort of poke around in.\u201d</p><div id=\"d1712f3d32114b4eba73f62b468c001c\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p><em>Little Kitty, Big City</em> has Saturday-morning-cartoon vibes, with hand-animated scenes and a clean, friendly art style. The main character, Kitty, has wide green eyes, inky fur and batlike ears, and they\u2019re on a mission to find their way home to an apartment complex in the center of a bustling downtown. However, procrastination is highly encouraged. <em>Little Kitty, Big City</em> is an open-world game filled with adorable animals to befriend, people to pester, quests to complete and hats to wear.</p><p>The hats are embellished bonnets that come in various forms, including a fish head, a half-shucked corn cob, little devil ears, a cowboy situation, a hedgehog and even some root vegetables. Kitty\u2019s face endearingly pokes through the center of each hat, and they can be equipped at will throughout the game. Aside from a few unique cases, there are no stats attached to the hats \u2014 wearing the ladybug head doesn\u2019t grant Kitty movement speed, and the construction hat doesn\u2019t add bonus armor. Mostly, they exist to be cute.</p><p>\u201cAs a game designer, you kind of sit down and go, what is the purpose of this thing that you're doing?\u201d Wood said. \u201cYou always need a function, a purpose, a reason for doing the thing. I think 10 years ago, I would have said, OK, hats are gonna give you this ability, or, like, there's going to be all of this gameplay tied to all this stuff. And while that is true for some things regarding the hats, largely, they're cosmetic. It was refreshing to come to that conclusion to say, no, these are just for fun.\u201d</p><figure><img alt=\"Little Kitty, Big City\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/6a562430-4047-11ee-bffb-74ae840d35a8\" style=\"height: 1080px; width: 1920px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Double Dagger Studio</div></figure><p>Wood\u2019s long history at Valve contextualizes his current role as the founder of an independent studio, and his years inside the insular company have helped shape his approach to game design.</p><p>Valve is a unique behemoth, even in the AAA space. It owns Steam, which functions as a bottomless bank; it\u2019s a private company, so it doesn\u2019t have shareholders to appease; and it\u2019s the steward of iconic franchises including Portal, Half-Life, Counter-Strike, Left 4 Dead, Team Fortress and Dota 2 (many of which are on Wood\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9).</p><p>\u201cValve is not a typical large game studio,\u201d Wood said. \u201cYou have a lot of autonomy and freedom to do things there. But, you still sort of live within that direction that Valve goes in.\u201d</p><p>Valve\u2019s internal structure has long been the subject of myth and legend among video game fans, with the company\u2019s founder Gabe Newell in the role of messiah and the Valve Handbook for New Employees as its sacred text. The handbook <a href=\"https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/publications\">made its way online</a> in 2012 and went viral for its Libertarian-inspired corporate ideals \u2014 it outlined a flat hierarchy at Valve, suggesting employees had the ability to manage themselves and work on their dream projects at any given time. This cemented Valve\u2019s reputation as an ultra-rad, super-cool<em>&nbsp;</em>video game company in the public eye, and this perception persists today.</p><p>In practice, this structure has resulted in an incredibly rich company that doesn\u2019t produce much. It\u2019s a running joke that Valve can\u2019t count to three: <em>Half-Life 2: Episode Two</em> and <em>Team Fortress 2</em> came out in 2007, <em>Left 4 Dead 2</em> came out in 2009, and <em>Portal 2</em> came out in 2011. In 2020, Valve debuted <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em>, a VR game exclusive to the studio\u2019s Index hardware, and after <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/valve-tf2-bots-crisis-video-180003369.html\">ignoring an extremely disruptive bot invasion</a>, the company rolled out an update to <em>TF2 </em>this summer, largely comprising community-made maps and assets. Meanwhile, Steam has been printing money while maintaining Valve\u2019s deathgrip on the PC marketplace.</p><figure><img alt=\"Little Kitty, Big City\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/6a589530-4047-11ee-bf6f-87f9e3e467b3\" style=\"height: 1080px; width: 1920px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Double Dagger Studio</div></figure><p>When Wood talks about the fun and freedom he feels building<em> Little Kitty, Big City</em>, he compares it with a top-down rigidity and complacent bureaucracy he experienced in Valve\u2019s production line. Here\u2019s how he described it:</p><p>\u201cValve talks a lot about, like, you can do anything you want. And it's like, well \u2014 that's never true. You know, Valve has a direction and they have a trajectory. And so, for me, it was realizing that the direction that Valve was going in was not a place that I wanted to be long-term. Because I\u2019d been there for a long time and they were sitting on their laurels a little bit, and it's like they weren't really challenging themselves, taking risks or doing anything. Steam\u2019s making a lot of money so they don't really have to, but I was not OK with that. And after many years of trying to figure out how to manage that, I decided, you know, it's important for me to go and make my own decisions for a while.\u201d</p><p>Wood made it clear that he appreciated the opportunities and stability that Valve provided him, and overall he called it a \u201cgreat company.\u201d It\u2019s easy to see why so many talented game developers are drawn to Valve, a studio with unlimited resources, a laissez-faire management style and a library of prestigious IP. Working at an established studio also means there are plenty of experts around to check your progress and offer advice, and these are fail-safes that Wood doesn\u2019t have any longer as an independent developer.</p><p>\u201cThat can be a bit scary,\u201d Wood said. \u201cBut it's been great. I love working with a small team focused on a game where, to us, it's different. To me, it's a challenge.\u201d</p><figure><img alt=\"Little Kitty, Big City\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/18f6bb30-4048-11ee-bed7-bda3f4c44af1\" style=\"height: 1080px; width: 1920px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Double Dagger Studio</div></figure><p>Wood said that even though he likely works more now, he also has more energy and passion for his projects than he did in his final five years at Valve. <em>Little Kitty, Big City</em> represents a litany of game-design firsts for Wood, including the fact that it\u2019s a mini open world and it has zero combat. There are now seven full-time team members at Double Dagger Studio, plus a few contributors, and they all found each other naturally, by Digital Age standards \u2014 Wood shared early ideas of <em>Little Kitty, Big City</em> on Twitter, and interested developers got in touch.</p><p>\u201cAt first I did reach out to some of my co-workers who had left Valve already and they were interested, but like \u2014 this was a common theme about reaching out to people who used to work at Valve, is that most people when they leave Valve, they're kind of done,\u201d Wood said.</p><p>Despite <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/indie-games-have-entered-the-era-of-bespoke-publishing-170639414.html\">the current surge</a> of indie-focused publishers like Annapurna Interactive, Devolver Digital, Private Division, Humble, Netflix and Raw Fury, Wood is self-publishing <em>Little Kitty, Big City</em> under Double Dagger Studio. That\u2019s not to say he didn\u2019t explore a potential partnership \u2014 he actually made it all the way to final contract meetings with one publisher in particular, but in the end, he turned the deal down.</p><p>\u201cIt didn't make any sense,\u201d Wood said. \u201cBecause what they were able to do, for me, absolutely did not justify the money that they were gonna take. And so it was really hard to find a publisher that made sense. I think that the difference between where I was in my career, and where someone maybe right out of school would be, is that I walked away from Valve with a chunk of money that I said, \u2018I'm gonna invest that into a company.\u2019 And so I didn't have to rely on a publisher to spend $100,000 on a year of development or whatever. I did have that freedom and space to say no.\u201d</p><figure><img alt=\"Little Kitty, Big City\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/6a5e6190-4047-11ee-bbaf-bd22d5b8f19c\" style=\"height: 1080px; width: 1920px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Double Dagger Studio</div></figure><p>This year alone, <em>Little Kitty, Big City</em> was announced for Switch, it had a successful showing at Summer Game Fest, and it\u2019s getting some fresh swag in the form of <a href=\"https://www.makeship.com/products/little-kitty-plush\">a Makeship campaign</a> offering an exceedingly cute Kitty plush and a salmon-shaped, zip-up catnip toy. The Double Dagger team is finishing the game while Wood oversees it all, no safety net in sight.</p><p>When we first started talking, Wood described<em> Little Kitty, Big City</em> as something like <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> or <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>, a game about a lost soul trying to find their way home and meeting a colorful cast of characters along the journey.

That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you should put off buying a machine if you need one now, as history indicates, Apple will likely continue to sell and market previous-generation devices. For those who aren\u2019t preoccupied with needing the latest edition, the Apple laptops we recommend here should give you years of reliable use. Based on our testing, here are the best MacBooks for everyone from students to power users.</p><h2><br />Best overall: MacBook Air M2</h2><p></p><p>Our resident laptop expert Devindra Hardawar called the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS8yMDIyLUFwcGxlLU1hY0Jvb2stTGFwdG9wLWNoaXAvZHAvQjBCM0JWV0o2WS8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tdmwtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImE2ZGNhYjI1LTBkNzMtNGRhMi05OGJhLThhNGJkOGNiODY0ZCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAaNkgrrG9NWMcefckvhwPK3gpuQZ_4KqPp6ddPNQS7Ch&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2F2022-Apple-MacBook-Laptop-chip%2Fdp%2FB0B3BVWJ6Y%2F\">MacBook Air M2</a> a \u201cnear-perfect Mac\u201d <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/macbook-air-m2-review-2022-130040098.html\">in his review</a>, awarding it a high score of 96. It\u2019s the newer of the two Air models Apple still sells, and notably a better buy than the 13-inch MacBook Pro, as the latter is both heavier and more expensive. The Air was built around the new M2 chip and completely refreshed for 2022 with a new, squared-off design that <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/macbook-air-m2-hands-on-192857444.html\">ditches the wedge</a> shape.</p><p>The 13.6-inch Liquid Retina screen hits up to 500 nits, making it both bigger and brighter than the previous generation. The 60Hz refresh rate doesn\u2019t deliver the butter-smooth scrolling you get on Pro models, but it\u2019s lovely nonetheless. The quad speaker array pumps out great sound, filling a room at max volume without distortion, and the three-mic array does a good job of picking up your voice for video calls. The 1080p webcam is an improvement over previous generations. It even beats our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-laptops-120008636.html\">top Windows laptop</a>, Dell\u2019s XPS 13 Plus which still sports a 720p camera, but Devindra found the image the Air captures to be drab.</p><p>Despite being thinner than ever, the M2 Air manages to hang on to its 3.5mm headphone jack and includes two USB-C Thunderbolt ports and a MagSafe connector. That means you don\u2019t have to block a potential data port while charging. The battery life is ample, lasting 16 hours and 30 minutes in our rundown test, which should be more than enough for a day (or two) of work.</p><p>The M2 processor gives the Air enough speed to play games, particularly those from Apple Arcade. Streaming and cloud gaming work well through Safari, and you\u2019ll find a handful of compatible titles on Steam. However, many of the bigger AAA releases still aren\u2019t compatible with Macs \u2013 though Apple is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/06/apple-execs-on-m2-chips-winning-gamers-and-when-to-buy-a-mac/\">looking to change</a> that. Our review unit performed well in benchmark tests, beating the Air M1 and nearly matching the performance of the 13-inch MacBook Pro M2. It\u2019s a fanless system which means it\u2019s quiet, but to keep things cool, the CPU does have to be throttled occasionally.</p><p>Overall, it\u2019s an excellent choice for everyday use and can handle most tasks. Of course, if you\u2019re planning on doing intensive video editing, you\u2019ll likely want something more powerful, such as the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=0eee6f60-6f21-4ba6-b70e-cc15b39bf860&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Adorama&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIwZWVlNmY2MC02ZjIxLTRiYTYtYjcwZS1jYzE1YjM5YmY4NjAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWRvcmFtYS5jb20vYWNtbmVxM2xsYTMuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTZkY2FiMjUtMGQ3My00ZGEyLTk4YmEtOGE0YmQ4Y2I4NjRkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAVVNv9rtuH9rSXo2a6Ew15Gk9tKtDhoe8B3sPboFgmgy&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Facmneq3lla3.html\">MacBook Pro M2</a>, but the Air is arguably the best multipurpose, ultraportable laptop that Apple makes.</p><p>Our review MacBook Air had an M2 chip with a 10-core GPU, along with 16GB of memory and 1TB of storage. <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=95276f3c-7b79-4c1e-803f-981cd9f7a968&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=B%26H+Photo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5NTI3NmYzYy03Yjc5LTRjMWUtODAzZi05ODFjZDlmN2E5NjgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmhwaG90b3ZpZGVvLmNvbS9jL3Byb2R1Y3QvMTcxMDM0My1SRUcvYXBwbGVfbWJhbTJtbl8xN18xM182X21hY2Jvb2tfYWlyX20yLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImE2ZGNhYjI1LTBkNzMtNGRhMi05OGJhLThhNGJkOGNiODY0ZCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAUmdbrRM1FOETlKvQuHoo5Lmrd4pURjP8PEw9-uXKi0W&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1710343-REG%2Fapple_mbam2mn_17_13_6_macbook_air_m2.html\">That configuration will run you $1,799</a>.

The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-15-inch-review-a-bigger-screen-makes-a-surprising-difference-130033172.html\">new laptop</a> does everything that 13-inch model does well, while giving you a larger screen to work with in a still-svelte package. It doesn't side-step the very Apple issue of having a little less RAM and storage than we'd prefer in its base model (8GB, 256GB SSD), but that doesn't hold it back. It's one of the best MacBooks we've used recently and it gives fans of the Air lineup a new configuration to consider. And since it\u2019s starting price is only $200 more than that of the 13-inch Air, the jump isn\u2019t as cost-prohibitive as, say, the 14-inch MacBook Pro, which starts at a whopping $2,000.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/macbook-air-m2-review-2022-130040098.html\"><strong>Read our full review of the 13-inch Apple MacBook Air M2</strong></a></p><h2>Best budget option: MacBook Air M1</h2><p></p><p>The <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BcHBsZS1NYWNCb29rLTEzLWluY2gtMjU2R0ItU3RvcmFnZS9kcC9CMDhONUxOUUNYP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXZsLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhNmRjYWIyNS0wZDczLTRkYTItOThiYS04YTRiZDhjYjg2NGQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAReEXoe33_QT6x1DOD1ZdEai0pci9piLnJJPveMW55Sv&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage%2Fdp%2FB08N5LNQCX\">MacBook Air M1</a> may not have the most current Apple silicon, but it gets so much right that it\u2019s still an excellent laptop, and probably the best MacBook for college students. It earned a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-140031323.html\">high score of 94</a> in our review and Devindra declared it one of the fastest ultraportables you could buy at the time. Of course, now that the M2 is on the scene, its numbers are comparatively less impressive \u2013 but with a base price of $999 (and often on sale for less), it\u2019s a relatively affordable way for students or those with tight budgets to snag an entry-level machine that's both fast and capable.</p><p>The Air\u2019s 13.3-inch Retina display looks beautiful and is ideal for binge sessions. The laptop\u2019s sturdy, wedge-shaped unibody case weighs just 2.8 pounds, making it easy to take to class or work. You can even fire it up in the quietest library without making a sound, thanks to a heat sink and passive cooling that eliminate the need for a fan. The keyboard offers a satisfying amount of depth despite its thin profile and the trackpad is smooth.</p><p>The performance of the M1 chip really makes the MacBook Air M1 stand out. It\u2019s impressively responsive, launching apps nearly instantly and running them effortlessly. Safari delivers a slick browsing experience, loading complex pages quickly. The M1 chip is also behind the Air\u2019s long battery life. We managed to get 16 hours and 20 minutes during our video rundown test, which should be more than enough to get you through a full-day grind.</p><p>Of course, it\u2019s not without drawbacks. The M1 Air houses a 720p webcam, which isn\u2019t as sharp as the M2 Air\u2019s 1080p camera and it only comes with two Thunderbolt ports and a headphone jack. If you\u2019re charging your computer, there\u2019s only one available plug for accessories.

WD also doesn't offer a 2TB card like Seagate does, so you'll need to consider the competition if 1TB just isn't enough.

However, if you're new to the console, the tricky part is knowing what titles and peripherals are worth your time.

It will help you stop nerves from fraying and is a must for any multiplayer game. The options for gaming headsets are vast, so we recommend picking one with a solid track record. SteelSeries recently <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/steelseries-arctis-7-7plus-annoucement-195740872.html\">updated its iconic Arctis 7</a> headset with the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=e8351d9d-883b-4d2b-9ca2-def694c65fa7&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=SteelSeries&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJlODM1MWQ5ZC04ODNiLTRkMmItOWNhMi1kZWY2OTRjNjVmYTciLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9zdGVlbHNlcmllcy5jb20vZ2FtaW5nLWhlYWRzZXRzL2FyY3Rpcy03cC1wbHVzPyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYjQ1ZTBkYmEtOWZmOC00OWQ4LTlkNDUtOWE3MTRlMzU0NjMwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAZkWcO6gPJtoE4GRcc03SBJFhP9ly3h6v1Y705pGM_pF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsteelseries.com%2Fgaming-headsets%2Farctis-7p-plus%3F\">7P+</a> which has improved battery life and a USB-C port for charging. What the company <em>didn't </em>change was the headband design that many people credit for making the Arctis 7 one of the more comfortable headsets on the market. The 7P+ costs the same as the standard 7+ variant, but also adds full support for the PS5's Tempest 3D audio technology.</p><h2>WD Black SN850</h2><p></p><p>Sony recently released an update to allow PS5 owners to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-ps-5-ssd-storage-expansion-firmware-update-ps4-remote-play-135032853.html\">expand their console's internal storage</a>. And it's a good thing, because the 667GB of usable storage the console comes with can feel limiting quickly. We already published a comprehensive guide on the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-ps5-ssd-expansion-upgrade-150052315.html\">best SSDs</a> you can buy for your PlayStation 5. You'll want to check that article out for a step-by-step guide on how to upgrade your SSD. But if you want to make things as simple as possible, your best bet is a Gen4 M.2 NVME SSD with a built-in heatsink. One of the better plug-and-play options is the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOFBIU1ZXN0svcmVmPW94X3NjX2FjdF90aXRsZV8xP3NtaWQ9QVRWUERLSUtYMERFUiZ0aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWU0LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiNDVlMGRiYS05ZmY4LTQ5ZDgtOWQ0NS05YTcxNGUzNTQ2MzAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUw3krPhvLRh64slxm7YihORKbiYwdC9qNqyxGsFuMI3&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB08PHSVW7K%2Fref%3Dox_sc_act_title_1%3Fsmid%3DATVPDKIKX0DER%26th%3D1\">SN850 from WD Black</a>. It checks off all the compatibility requirements listed by Sony and is reasonably priced, too.</p><h2>Samsung T7 SSD</h2><p></p><p>If you don't feel comfortable opening your PS5 to install a new SSD, another option is to purchase an external solid-state drive. Keep in mind that <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wbGF5c3RhdGlvbi5jb20vZW4tY2Evc3VwcG9ydC9oYXJkd2FyZS9wczUtZXh0ZW5kZWQtc3RvcmFnZS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImI0NWUwZGJhLTlmZjgtNDlkOC05ZDQ1LTlhNzE0ZTM1NDYzMCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAeuvMVb0tDrkV6Maoxe-9yhXyvRioDmB2pzWHLcDkMp4&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.playstation.com%2Fen-ca%2Fsupport%2Fhardware%2Fps5-extended-storage%2F\">you can't play PS5</a> games from an external drive. However, it takes less time to copy one over from an SSD than it does to download it from the PlayStation Store. One of our favorite portable drives is the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDg3NFlKUDkyP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWU0LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiNDVlMGRiYS05ZmY4LTQ5ZDgtOWQ0NS05YTcxNGUzNTQ2MzAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAU7Be52VhKJTXIv2Paq07vkfGNeezGTgYN-hUJOHuTxa&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0874YJP92%3F\">Samsung T7</a>. It can write files at a speedy 1,000 MB/s and comes with a shock-resistant enclosure to protect the drive from physical damage. If you plan to use the SSD exclusively for storing games, you can save money by buying the standard model instead of the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TQU1TVU5HLVJlc2lzdGFudC1QaG90b2dyYXBoZXJzLU1VLVBFMlQwUy1BTS9kcC9CMDlWTEhSNEpDP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWU0LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiNDVlMGRiYS05ZmY4LTQ5ZDgtOWQ0NS05YTcxNGUzNTQ2MzAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAS8o7ALvHEIl3VSeBiOlTizAWdaRGDJG_Ve6Ah8KVaPh&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSAMSUNG-Resistant-Photographers-MU-PE2T0S-AM%2Fdp%2FB09VLHR4JC\">Shield variant</a>, which has a ruggedized exterior for extra protection for those who are always on the go.</p><h2>DualSense Charging Station</h2><p></p><p>While you can charge your <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9EdWFsU2Vuc2UtV2lyZWxlc3MtQ29udHJvbGxlci1QbGF5U3RhdGlvbi01L2RwL0IwOEZDNkM3NVk_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZTQtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImI0NWUwZGJhLTlmZjgtNDlkOC05ZDQ1LTlhNzE0ZTM1NDYzMCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAay3DiU1XCbhfnSgG-YkoJm0H-YJcpxaUh-GNRjDSoSD&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDualSense-Wireless-Controller-PlayStation-5%2Fdp%2FB08FC6C75Y\">DualSense controller</a> with the USB-C cable that comes with your PS5, a more elegant solution is the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9EdWFsU2Vuc2UtQ2hhcmdpbmctU3RhdGlvbi1QbGF5U3RhdGlvbi01L2RwL0IwOEZDNlk0Vkc_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZTQtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImI0NWUwZGJhLTlmZjgtNDlkOC05ZDQ1LTlhNzE0ZTM1NDYzMCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAASJVP5_KV2w6svhmvvZGAFQP_9DZSYzas170VPX5x8wc&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDualSense-Charging-Station-PlayStation-5%2Fdp%2FB08FC6Y4VG\">DualSense Charging Station</a>. It can store and charge two controllers simultaneously. In that way, you can always have a second PS5 controller ready to go if the one you're currently using runs out of battery. The charger will also free up the USB ports on your PS5 for other accessories.</p><h2>Elden Ring</h2><p></p><p>Unless you spent very little time on the internet this year, it\u2019s safe to say it was impossible to avoid the conversation around <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDk3NDNGOFA2P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWU0LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiNDVlMGRiYS05ZmY4LTQ5ZDgtOWQ0NS05YTcxNGUzNTQ2MzAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAd8W66VoNB9iJSflHamonuk4xav-Jhw3lxYEktm6iib1&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09743F8P6\"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>. After putting about 100 hours into FromSoftware\u2019s latest, I can safely say the praise is warranted. Like a lot of other people, I was tired of Western-style open-world games and their endless checklists by the time I got around to playing <em>Elden Ring</em>, but its take on the genre was anything but tired. As I stumbled my way through the game\u2019s dark caves, ruined cathedrals and enchanted forests, I felt like there was a discovery waiting for me across every hill and river. That\u2019s a feeling I haven\u2019t had since I was a kid playing through the <em>Ocarina of Time</em> and <em>Majora\u2019s Mask</em>.</p><p>If that\u2019s not enough to convince you to try <em>Elden Ring</em>, know that the game\u2019s maximalist approach makes it the most approachable FromSoftware release to date. Whenever you\u2019re stuck on a boss, you can go elsewhere to level your character and master the game\u2019s punishing combat.</p><h2>God of War Ragnar\u00f6k</h2><p></p><p>Did you think Sony\u2019s latest exclusive would be absent from this list? <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMEI2MjI4WEJNP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWU0LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiNDVlMGRiYS05ZmY4LTQ5ZDgtOWQ0NS05YTcxNGUzNTQ2MzAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWB-8RmbELIUhSVL_uxLOsQsgLE0eT4x8vn_FBO_sQiw&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0B6228XBM\"><em>God of War Ragnar\u00f6k</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>can sometimes suffer from pacing issues and <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy55b3V0dWJlLmNvbS93YXRjaD92PWNaZ2pSY1lHa1k4IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiNDVlMGRiYS05ZmY4LTQ5ZDgtOWQ0NS05YTcxNGUzNTQ2MzAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdcGQ3XvwH9yNNLchoRgVNYPN6BZR9BAgpmTFqAmqmZN&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DcZgjRcYGkY8\">overly chatty NPCs</a>, but there\u2019s no denying that Santa Monica Studio has crafted another heartfelt chapter in the story of Kratos and Atreus. The PS5 is also the best place to play <em>Ragnar\u00f6k</em>. On Sony\u2019s latest console, the game ships with two rendering modes and support for variable and high frame rates. Provided you own a relatively recent TV, those features make it possible to play the action RPG at up to 90 frames per second in some situations. That\u2019s a level of technical proficiency we haven\u2019t seen in a lot of AAA console games.</p><h2><em>Death's Door</em></h2><p></p><p>With a title that evokes the end of all things, you might think <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deaths-door-playstation-november-23-213345948.html\"><em>Death's Door</em></a> is a bleak game. But that couldn't be further from the truth. Buoyed by a beautiful soundtrack and art style, it's one of the most thoughtful and pleasant <a href=\"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10003808\">indies</a> I've played recently. Developer Acid Nerve's tribute to <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> and <em>Dark Souls</em> is a must-play for those who love to lose themselves in a world of mystery and intrigue.</p><h2><em>Ghosts of Tsushima Directors Cut</em></h2><p></p><p>You've played games like <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOThHMzRHQlQvcmVmPW94X3NjX2FjdF90aXRsZV8xP3NtaWQ9QVRWUERLSUtYMERFUiZwc2M9MSZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1lNC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYjQ1ZTBkYmEtOWZmOC00OWQ4LTlkNDUtOWE3MTRlMzU0NjMwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAb0q4LpzjYdGDVdzqmqDuVTg8J-TQzQipz93ANEYN1j2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB098G34GBT%2Fref%3Dox_sc_act_title_1%3Fsmid%3DATVPDKIKX0DER%26psc%3D1\"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></a> before. It borrows from the familiar open-world formula popularized by Assassin's Creed and other Ubisoft titles. But that's not a knock against it. Far from it, Sucker Punch's latest is so easy to recommend because it executes the open-world concept flawlessly. The studio has created a beautiful playground steeped in Feudal Japanese culture, myth and history for players to explore, with something interesting to find beyond every ridge. Combat is also a highlight, allowing you to play either as honorable samurai, terrifying assassin or a mixture of both. And once you have finished Tsushima's touching single-player story, there's the excellent Legends multiplayer mode to keep you busy for the long haul.</p><h2><em>Hades</em></h2><p></p><p>If you pick up only one game from this list, make it <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wbGF5c3RhdGlvbi5jb20vZW4tdXMvZ2FtZXMvaGFkZXMvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiNDVlMGRiYS05ZmY4LTQ5ZDgtOWQ0NS05YTcxNGUzNTQ2MzAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAXFbbN3TBBisIy41PK6evbjUAQi7PY5KX6t2-pUY7U1a&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fhades%2F\"><em>Hades</em></a>.
