The most excitement from my commute to my office is a hungry cat screaming at me while I try to make coffee and prepare for another day of Facebook-throttling content. So, I miss out on <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/gun-man-traffic-light\" target=\"_blank\">things like this</a>: freeway traffic being brought to a standstill over two women getting into fisticuffs.</p><p>And that's before the footrace starts.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FightHaven/status/1693759890131386628\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You know the deal. It's a viral video, allow for missing context and whatnot. The context I'm most curious about is how this fight started. Because it takes place in the middle of a freeway, and shawty with the shorty-shorts doesn't look like someone who was driving. Unless her man was driving, only he's beta and, after cutting someone off, sat in the car while his girlfriend did all the work. </p><p>Either that, or the one in white is the \"other woman\" and picked an awkward time to confront her boyfriend's wife. And how did she know they would be driving down the freeway at that moment and manage to run into the middle of traffic? These are the questions we need answered.</p><p>I feel bad for the one in white because we've all been there. You pick a fight with someone more significant than you, and then the moment of clarity smacks you upside the head that... I just picked a fight with someone bigger than me. Fight or flight. She chose flight. Until she found herself eating pavement. Hey, it happens.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

That brings us to the next part.</p><p>Even Trump's harshest critics not employed by cable news or the Lincoln Project view it all as a political witchhunt.

It's just the new rules. These are the rules of engagement put forth by the Left and the media (but I repeat myself). No one with an (R-State) after their name is going to attack Trump because he's the current target of these new rules.

John Rich (legit the reason I'm into country music) also does things on his own, and he dropped X about it.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnrich/status/1693252105560092953\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is why I hate when people say the \"woke\" music industry. The music industry is you, your guitar, and your hustle. Or in The Marine Rapper's case, his beat composer. It's a matter of naming your price. If you want billions of dollars and major stadium tours, then you may have to decide if not being allowed an opinion is a fair trade off. If you want to just make a living providing for your family by sharing music, f*ck the industry.</p><p>One of the best pieces of advice I've ever heard comes from Dave Chappelle's dad.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brodigan/status/1693300316282692065\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As Anthony says: \"People in the music industry give me blank stares when I brush off 8 million dollar offers. I don't want 6 tour buses, 15 tractor trailers and a jet. I don't want to play stadium shows, I don't want to be in the spotlight. I wrote the music I wrote because I was suffering with mental health and depression. These songs have connected with millions of people on such a deep level because they're being sung by someone feeling the words in the very moment they were being sung. No editing, no agent, no bulls--t. Just some idiot and his guitar. The style of music that we should have never gotten away from in the first place.\"</p><p>Now we need to see Oliver Anthony and the Marine Rapper on stage together.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

Not just that debate, but any debate this cycle.</p><p>Many people are saying Trump is too chicken to have his record challenged (not draining the swamp, not locking her up, turning his presidency over to Fauci, school lockdowns, small business lockdowns, the Trump schmaccine, blindly signing spending bills like the CARES Act which led to 2020's mail-in voting, a string of electoral defeats since 2016, etc.). I'm not saying that, but many people are. </p><p>According to the former president, even though the first votes aren't for five months, because he is ahead in public opinion polls -- many of which have been conducted by the corporate media -- <a href=\"https://redstate.com/bobhoge/2023/08/20/trump-touts-strong-poll-numbers-i-will-therefore-not-be-doing-the-debates-n2162847\" target=\"_blank\">he does not need to debate his opponents</a>. </p><blockquote>New CBS poll has me out by \"legendary\" numbers...

Because it Proved Trump was Right</a></p><p>As of right now, it appears Trump's handpicked establishment RNC Chair Ronna Romney-McDaniel isn't going to do anything about this, and is even letting Trump send surrogates to spin for him at a debate he refuses to go to. Fox News is also planning to use Trump clips instead of having the candidates who did show up talk about issues that matter to voters.</p><p>It will be interesting to see how the other GOP candidates respond.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brodigan/status/1687056710890815489\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My personal opinion is that this is a mistake on Trump's part. Primary polls are notoriously unreliable, and while Trump might be in the lead now, it's a soft lead. The first votes aren't until January, and while Trump may be the most popular now when a pollster asks a voter who they like, primary voters are known to take their time before deciding who they pull the lever for.</p><p>As today's Des Moines Register Iowa Caucus poll shows, while Trump is up overall, five months is an eternity in politics.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarcACaputo/status/1693567535298306367\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are also variables to consider if Trump gets the nomination. What about when Joe Biden says he's not going to debate? Or when CBS News airs something critical of the former president? Do they go back to being fake news? Will Biden be too scared to debate before the American people?</p><p>If I was Donald Trump, I'd show up and debate and dominate all my opponents. At least until people start voting. Once the voting starts and he still has such a dominant lead, then he can say the race is over and it's time to unite.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.
