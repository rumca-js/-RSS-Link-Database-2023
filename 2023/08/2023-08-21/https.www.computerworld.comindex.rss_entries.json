The problem is that once a Mac is stuck in that mode, it\u2019s necessary to use a second Mac and Apple Configurator to get the machines going again.</p><p>In Sonoma, this is less of an issue because the relevant Configurator tools are now built into the Finder (though you will still need a second Mac to run the software).</p><h2>USB-C cable still required</h2>\n<p>The good news is that connecting a second Mac to the bricked machine will no longer require you to download and install Configurator; you\u2019ll only need a USB-C cable. Pop the cable into the rescue Mac and shut down the Mac you hope to bring back, then connect the cable to that second machine and follow the specific DFU instructions for your Mac, as detailed within <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/apple-configurator-mac/apdd5f3c75ad/mac\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">this extensive Apple Support post</a>.</p><p class=\"jumpTag\"><a href=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/3705209/macos-sonoma-beta-hints-dfu-boost-for-mac-admins.html#jump\">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>", "link": "https://www.computerworld.com/article/3705209/macos-sonoma-beta-hints-dfu-boost-for-mac-admins.html#tk.rss_all", "date_published": "2023-08-21T15:31:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/03/apple-configurator-2-icon-100879998-small.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.computerworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Why and how to create corporate genAI policies", "description": "<article>\n\t<section class=\"page\">\n<p>As a large number of companies continue to test and deploy generative artificial intelligence (genAI) tools, many are at risk of AI errors, malicious attacks, and running afoul of regulators \u2014 not to mention the potential exposure of sensitive data.</p><p>For example, in April, after Samsung\u2019s semiconductor division allowed engineers to use ChatGPT, workers using the platform leaked trade secrets on least three instances, according to\u00a0<a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/samsung-chatgpt-leak-details\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">published accounts</a>.
