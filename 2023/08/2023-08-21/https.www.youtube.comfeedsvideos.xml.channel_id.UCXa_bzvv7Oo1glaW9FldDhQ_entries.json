And with Ride 5 being the series\u2019 first game that\u2019s exclusive to current-gen consoles, expectations are naturally high for the sequel. \n\nWe\u2019re happy to report that Ride 5 definitely stands tall as a worthy successor to what came before, and it makes great use of Epic\u2019s Unreal Engine to bring some gorgeous visuals to life. While the developer has taken a more iterative approach with its upgrades as opposed to a radical overhaul, the end result is quality stuff nonetheless. We have tested the game on PS5, and with this video- we break down individual elements of Ride 5\u2019s visual presentation.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDX3yrhvo70", "date_published": "2023-08-21T15:30:14+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/UDX3yrhvo70/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Why Starfield Will Be The Biggest Game of the Year", "description": "Any time you\u2019re playing a Bethesda Game Studios RPG, if there\u2019s one thing you can take as a sure shot guarantee, it\u2019s that the world you\u2019ll be exploring will be brimming with rich lore and worldbuilding to make it all come alive.\n\nAnd though the upcoming Starfield is obviously going to set itself apart from past BGS titles in several ways simply by virtue of being a completely new thing, that\u2019s the one area where we can safely expect to have a pretty good idea of what we\u2019ll be in for. \n\nBethesda has already spoken plenty about Starfield\u2019s setting, the Settled Systems, and the many NPCs that will populate that setting, and here, we\u2019re going to take a look at each one and go over everything that we know about them so far.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcA_PhUg4r4", "date_published": "2023-08-21T09:30:11+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/gcA_PhUg4r4/hqdefault.jpg"}]
