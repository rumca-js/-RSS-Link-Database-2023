<p>Two people injured after Ukrainian drone falls on house in Moscow; Greece to train F-16 pilots</p><p><strong>At least two people were injured on Monday when parts of a Ukrainian drone fell on a house in the Moscow region,</strong> the local governor said. Nearly 90 plane flights in and out of the capital were disrupted after Russia said it jammed a Ukrainian drone in the Ruzsky district west of the capital and destroyed another one in the Istrinsky district nearby.</p><p><strong>Posts on Russian social media channels indicate that Russian mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin has published his first recruitment video for the Wagner group since organising a short-lived mutiny against defence officials in Russia.</strong> A video posted Monday on Telegram messaging app channels that are believed to be affiliated with Prigozhin shows a person who appears to be the 62-year-old mercenary leader saying the Wagner group is “hiring real strongmen” and “making Russia even greater on all continents, and Africa even more free”. Prigozhin’s comments and some posts in the pro-Wagner channels suggested it was filmed in Africa.</p><p><strong>The Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, said Russian war crimes that have taken place in Ukraine “must be punished under international law”. </strong>During a press conference with Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Monday, Mitsotakis added that he “unreservedly condemned” Russia’s aggression in Ukraine.</p><p><strong>Greece will take part in training of Ukrainian air force pilots for F-16 jets, Zelenskiy said on Monday. </strong>Denmark and the Netherlands on Sunday announced they would supply the first F-16s to Ukraine. “Today, we have the important result for aviation coalition. Greece will participate in training of our pilots for F-16. I am grateful for this proposal,” Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, said during his joint press conference with the Greek PM in Athens.</p><p>Denmark’s decision to supply Ukraine with American F-16 fighter jets to fend off Russia’s invasion<strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/aug/21/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-zelenskiy-f-16s-moscow-nuclear-threat?page=with:block-64e324c98f08af8aaccf0e29#block-64e324c98f08af8aaccf0e29">represents an “escalation” of the conflict</a></strong>, Russia’s ambassador to Denmark, Vladimir Barbin, reportedly said.</p><p><strong>The Ukrainian president said during a visit to Sweden that Kyiv was “getting closer” to obtaining Swedish Gripen fighter jets</strong>. “Our soldiers are already starting to test them,” Zelenskiy said in his nightly address on Sunday, adding that he had discussed the matter with Sweden’s prime minister, Ulf Kristersson. Sweden, though, has not made any commitment to supply Gripens to Ukraine.</p><p><strong>On Monday in Copenhagen, Zelenskiy thanked Danish politicians on Monday for helping his country resist Russia’s invasion</strong>. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/aug/21/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-zelenskiy-f-16s-moscow-nuclear-threat?page=with:block-64e336d18f0897043a8e0c9d#block-64e336d18f0897043a8e0c9d">Ukraine’s president said</a> that if Russia succeeded, other parts of Europe would be at risk from the Kremlin’s military aggression. “All of Russia’s neighbours are under threat if Ukraine does not prevail.”</p><p><strong>Ukraine’s forces are repelling Russian attacks and have retaken several square kilometres on the eastern front over the past week, </strong>deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/aug/21/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-zelenskiy-f-16s-moscow-nuclear-threat?page=with:block-64e2ff038f0897043a8e0b19#block-64e2ff038f0897043a8e0b19">said on Monday</a><strong>.</strong> Ukrainian forces were advancing south of Bakhmut, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/10/ukraine-forces-capture-parts-of-bakhmut-from-russian-forces-kyiv-claims">the city occupied by Russian forces in May after a bloody months-long struggle</a>, and had liberated another three square kilometres over the past week, she said.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/22/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-545-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The editor of one of Russia’s independent newspapers, Dmitry Muratov, has risked his life to report on abuses of power against the odds. This is his remarkable but terrifying story</p><p>In 2021, Dmitry Muratov, editor-in-chief of the independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta, was jointly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/10/journalists-maria-ressa-and-dmitry-muratov-receive-nobel-peace-prize">awarded the Nobel peace prize, alongside the Philippines’ journalist Maria Ressa</a>. It marked, said the Nobel committee, “another existential point for democracy”, and the award was a rallying cry for truth, freedom of the press and holding power to account. The Price of Truth is a compelling documentary that follows Muratov and his work as the Russian invasion of Ukraine, giving real insight into how the war is seen on Russian soil, as well as internationally.</p><p>First, we meet Muratov, a brisk and bear-like man under immeasurable strain, who nevertheless finds moments of dry humour among the horrors, in the immediate aftermath of an attack in the carriage of a train in Moscow in April 2022. A man has poured red paint laced with acetone all over Muratov, damaging his eyesight, while another filmed the assault. The message, as he understood it, was: “Shut up, and keep your newspaper quiet.” At the time, Novaya Gazeta was still in operation; by the end of this film, every workaround that Muratov tried to find, in order to keep it publishing, has come to a dead end.</p><p>The Price of Truth was on Channel 4 and is available on All 4</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/aug/21/the-price-of-truth-review-this-gripping-look-at-russian-journalism-was-too-dangerous-to-finish-filming">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Far from ‘just another one of those slave stories’, this is a deeply woven whodunnit murder mystery. It is also a story about love, disfranchisement, and who holds the narrative</p><p>The late-Georgian stage is set for a fine gothic thriller, as a servant is dragged screaming from her blood-sodden mistress’s bed and arrested for the murders of her and the master of the house, who is splayed out on the floor downstairs. The accused, grief-stricken and protesting her innocence, is thrown into the filth of the nearest prison – and thereby hangs the entire tale.</p><p>Indeed, The Confessions of Frannie Langton, adapted by Sara Collins from her 2019 novel of the same name, is a fine gothic thriller. The mysterious murder is in place. There is Pooky Quesnel as the housekeeper Linux, who makes Mrs Danvers look like Amelia Bedelia. There is also a missing boy; hints of unspeakably loathsome practices in the background; and a slow-burning, illicit Sapphic relationship to leaven the mix without lowering the tension.

<p>The Line of Duty star is no stranger to breaking barriers, but will he be able to break the US? Jessop and his film-maker brother pitch a movie to a hotshot producer to find out</p><p>Tommy Jessop certainly isn’t shy about trying new things. Viewers may recognise him from his gripping portrayal of murder suspect Terry Boyle <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/mar/21/line-of-duty-recap-series-six-episode-one-oh-ac-12-how-weve-missed-you">in the final seasons of crime drama Line of Duty</a>. It was made all the more memorable by the fact that it was an exciting and multi-faceted role – something that is rarely afforded to actors with learning disabilities. He has starred opposite Nicholas Hoult in the BAFTA-nominated BBC drama Coming Down The Mountain, he was the first actor with Down’s syndrome to tour theatres as Hamlet, and has thrown himself into advocacy work – campaigning for the rights of people with Down’s syndrome. Breaking barriers is something that Jessop is no stranger to.</p><p>He still has a few tiny aspirations up his sleeve, though. “My new dream is to be the next Bond,” we see Jessop announce while onstage receiving an Honorary Doctorate of Arts at the University of Winchester. Narrowing his eyes, he turns to the side and puts his index fingers together in the classic Bond pose: “James Bond. Shaken, but not stirred.”</p><p>Tommy Jessop Goes To Hollywood aired on BBC One and is available on BBC iPlayer</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/aug/21/tommy-jessop-goes-to-hollywood-review-a-charming-attempt-to-create-a-down-syndrome-superhero-movie">Continue reading...</a>

<ul><li>American beats Jackson and Fraser-Pryce from outside lane</li><li>Britain’s Dina Asher-Smith trails in disappointing eighth</li></ul><p>Ever since Usain Bolt’s retirement, track and field has been desperate for a way to reenter the sporting mainstream. Over 10.65 extraordinary seconds it finally hit the jackpot. It came in the form of the 23-year-old Sha’Carri Richardson, the most flamboyant, brilliant and controversial talent the sport has seen for years, who powered home from lane nine to win a thrilling first 100m world title.</p><p>No one has ever disputed the American’s talent – or star power given she has 2.4 million Instagram followers. Two years ago she was one of the favourites for the Tokyo Olympics, only for her dreams to go up in smoke when she tested positive for marijuana at the US trials following the death of her mother. First she missed the Games.

<p>Rise of European superclubs raised the bar to undreamed level with Spain’s devastating show of strength and the US in decline</p><p>Lucy Bronze and Ona Batlle held each other. One in defeat and one in victory, one with a medal she wanted and one with a medal she did not. But in that moment they were not rivals or adversaries, just Lucy and Ona: friends, soulmates, former Manchester residents, and in very short order teammates at Barcelona.<br /><br />And as both sets of players embraced <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/20/spain-england-womens-world-cup-final-match-report">after Sunday’s draining final</a>, there was more than a degree of familiarity between them. Bronze has been joined by Keira Walsh at Barcelona, who provided eight of Spain’s finalists. Hannah Hampton grew up in Spain and spent part of her childhood in the Villarreal academy. Batlle has just spent three years at Manchester United playing with the likes of Katie Zelem, Ella Toone and Mary Earps.</p><p>As the curtain comes down on a month-long feast of football, this is in many ways the broader story of this World Cup: the most global and connected tournament that has taken place in women’s football. There may have been 32 nations taking part but in reality their players were representing more than 40 league systems around the world, from Kazakhstan to Iceland, Ecuador to Saudi Arabia. This cultural cross-pollination, an unprecedented movement of players across national borders, taking their styles and influences with them, has helped to contribute to perhaps the richest and certainly the most unpredictable World Cup in memory.<br /><br />This is a phenomenon that works in many directions. Open borders mean fewer secrets: where once a group game against Haiti might have been a step into the unknown, England’s analysts had ample footage of their prospective opponents from the 14 of them who ply their trade in France. But it also allows players from emerging nations to hone their skills at a higher level: Colombia’s irresistible adaptability was forged not just at home but in Spain and the United States, where 14 of them have played.

The central strand of Frances concerns a break-up: in the opening scene, the title character takes a phone call from her ex, Frank, asking to meet after two months’ separation. It blows her world apart. Ramoso then turns for advice to Frances’ best friend, played by an audience member. The story is then re-told from Frank’s perspective, before the estranged lovers meet to battle for control of the breakup narrative.</p><p>At <a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/laura-ramoso-frances">Pleasance Dome, Edinburgh</a>, until 28 August.

How many birthdays can I miss?</p><p>No matter the joy, the adrenaline, the rush, the guilt over feeling guilty when you’re doing a job you love and that others would give up a limb for, those questions still hit you. Regularly. In many ways, doing the job I do allows me spend time with my kid in ways that those working nine to five can’t. I’m here, I’m there, from matches to training grounds, but I’m able to help do the school runs, to be present day-to-day, but the tournaments take an emotional and physical toll. It is long days, late nights, thousands of words, mistimed video calls home, unhealthy eating, lots of travel, late-night podcast records, tempered only by the football, the players and the camaraderie between journalists.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/aug/21/womens-world-cup-was-a-long-trip-but-worth-it-to-help-move-the-game-forward">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on 'unretirement': older workers could help with labour shortages | Editorial

<p>Ministers need to better target policies to encourage economically inactive 50- to 64-year-olds back to work</p><p>The disappearance of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/20/the-guardian-view-on-britains-missing-workers-they-may-never-come-back" title="">565,000 mostly older people</a> from the UK’s labour force was one of the problematic effects of Covid. For most people, work is one of the things that gives their lives shape and meaning – as well as providing them with an income. For such a large number of older people not to need to work also points to rising generational inequality. In other countries, employment levels recovered more quickly to pre-2020 levels, making the UK an outlier. But while <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/uklabourmarket/august2023" title="">evidence</a> in the past few months points to a <a href="https://ifs.org.uk/articles/new-data-show-signs-over-50s-returning-workforce" title="">reversal of this trend</a> – and the rise of “unretirement” – there is no room for complacency.</p><p>Government initiatives aimed at addressing the issue have achieved little. In March, the Treasury came up with the idea of “returnerships” – a variant on apprenticeships aimed at coaxing mature people back to workplaces. But in reality this did not amount to much more than a new label for existing training. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/politics/ministers-accused-of-failing-in-attempts-to-tempt-over-50s-back-to-work-4261245" title="">fewer than one in 20</a> of participants in the government’s “skills bootcamps” – employer-led short courses aimed at equipping jobseekers for the opportunities in their area – are aged over 55.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/21/the-guardian-view-on-unretirement-older-workers-could-help-with-labour-shortages">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on the Chinese economy: it looks bad. What we can’t see may be worse | Editorial

<p>Political tightening and an anti-espionage law make it harder for outsiders to gauge the situation. How accurately can insiders do so?</p><p>A spate of recent statistics shows that the Chinese economy is faring poorly. The country was supposed to rebound after ditching its draconian “zero Covid” policies, but, after an initial revival, things have gone awry. Earlier this month it <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/08/chinese-economy-expected-to-have-slipped-into-deflation-as-recovery-falters" title="">slipped into deflation</a>. Key indicators, including industrial production, investment and retail sales, came in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/15/china-economy-july-industrial-output-fixed-asset-retail-data.html" title="">well below expectations</a>.</p><p>The most concerning figure, however, is the one that we can’t see. The youth unemployment rate <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/15/china-unemployment-rate-youth-economy" title="">was suspended from</a> the monthly economic data release, having reached a record 21.3% in June – suggesting not only that July was grimmer, but that improvement is not expected soon. The government has <a href="https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1691341030925193216" title="">stopped publishing swathes of statistics</a> in recent years. While there are many reasons for that, and while some may still be released to data firms, it has probably helped to bury some bad news, and makes it harder to cross-reference information. Chinese economists are also under pressure to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b2e0ad77-3521-4da9-8120-1f0c1fdd98f8" title="">avoid discussing negative indicators</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/21/the-guardian-view-on-the-chinese-economy-it-looks-bad-what-we-cant-see-may-be-worse">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In a new exhibition at the Whitney, 11 diverse artists explore ‘trust and also its failure’ through their work</p><p>Vulnerability, intimacy, and most of all trust are essential – albeit fraught – parts of our most important relationships. They can bring about the kind of connections that make life rich and meaningful, and they are what allow human beings to truly support one another, but they are also extremely complicated and often challenging to navigate. Through an intergenerational and diverse group of 11 artists, the Whitney’s new exhibit, Trust Me, offers audiences a chance to examine these concepts and their many different sides.</p><p>“Something that I hope people will come into the show and hold onto is the idea that trust is not always rewarded,” said Kelly Long, exhibition organizer and senior curatorial assistant at the Whitney. “This is a show about trust and also its failure. Who is the speaker? Who is asking for trust? Who is ordering trust? These are the questions that I hope people will take forward.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/aug/21/whitney-museum-new-york-trust-me-exhibit">Continue reading...</a>

The Screen Actors Guild (Sag-Aftra) is concerned with the use of digital likenesses, particularly after Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the guild’s chief negotiator, said studios proposed to pay background actors for a day’s work to use their images in perpetuity.

<p>After 21 years,  this celebration of musical eclecticism and reverence in nature earns its devoted fanbase once again</p><p>The national park in which it takes place has changed name to Bannau Brycheiniog, but 21 years in, most else about Green Man remains reassuringly the same. Subtle evolution, not revolution, has been the steady success of this 25,000 capacity all-ages celebration of musical eclecticism and reverence in nature: it’s practically as much a part of the Powys landscape as the soaring mountains that wrap the site in their misty embrace.</p><p>Green Man tickets sold out almost immediately this year before any artists were even announced – no mean feat in tight economic times. There’s no denying that prices have crept upwards sharply (£6.50 a pint of Growler). Yet Green Man’s core values hold strong. Sponsorship is eschewed. Sustainability, inclusivity (the lineup is gender balanced; two of the three main-stage headliners are female) and laid-back good vibes reign. Emerging artists, zeitgeisty heavy hitters and heritage heroes alike are platformed to often much bigger crowds than they would typically reach, and usually seize their moment.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/aug/21/green-man-festival-review-self-esteem-julie-byrne-devo">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Rishi Sunak is reportedly facing growing pressure to sack the home secretary. But the troubles go much deeper than that</p><p>If you had hired as many different builders in the past five years as Britain has hired home secretaries, you would assume your house was deeply flawed. Yet the latest, Suella Braverman, one of four in that time, has managed 10 months under Rishi Sunak and is <a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/suella-braverman-must-go-tories-call-rishi-sunak-oust-home-secretary-reshuffle-looms-2557836">reportedly</a> under pressure to be sacked. It is hard to imagine how a senior minister in a controversial department can operate when those around her think she is about to go. To put it mildly, the job should be held by someone with the authority to act. The habit of Boris Johnson and now Sunak of using cabinet jobs not as a reward for competence but in return for loyalty has been disastrous. The Home Office is not alone. In the past four years Britain has had six education secretaries and three transport secretaries. No wonder the British government is a mess.</p><p>Sunak’s appointing of a hard rightwinger to the high-profile position of home secretary, just a few days after she had been forced to resign from the same post, might have been politically wise had there been a plausible policy in place. On the leading electoral issue of immigration there was not. Whoever dreamed up this month’s headline-grabbing event of “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/13/how-the-small-boats-week-unravelled">small boats week</a>”, as if it were a yachting festival, should be fired.

<p>Otto Baxter’s gruesome Victorian romp – complete with sweary musical numbers – is loosely based on his life. It’s a unique, monster-filled scare-fest, with its own incredibly moving documentary</p><p>In 2009, Otto Baxter gave an interview to the BBC’s disability website Ouch! in which he outlined his ambitions: the 21-year-old hoped to one day become a porn star, make a rock record, star in Phantom of the Opera and direct “the greatest horror film ever”.</p><p>More than a decade later and there is no X-rated, thrash-metal version of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s musical on the horizon. But Baxter <em>has</em> made one of the most unusual horror films you’re likely to see. The Puppet Asylum is a 30-minute short inspired by Jack the Ripper, A Nightmare on Elm Street and, crucially, his own experience of living with Down syndrome.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/aug/21/otto-baxter-horror-film-debut-down-syndrome">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ignore Piers Morgan. Most people aren’t angry about the royal no-show – they just want to take our future king down a peg or two</p><p>A certain amount of indignation was only to be expected, post-World Cup, about the disparities in the treatment of the men’s and women’s games. Not to get too granular about it, because male footballers get paid so much that sometimes the world runs out of currency and has to top up their pay with panda cubs, and female footballers get paid slightly less than primary school teachers, I definitely expected at least some murmurs about fairness and equality, maybe even the spectacle of a Lioness bringing an equal pay claim to tribunal, which might not succeed but would be fun to watch.</p><p>The question I was not expecting was “Where was Prince William at the World Cup final?”, still less to hear it endlessly examined, by news anchors, bigmouths, football pundits and politicians. Who was the angriest, between <a href="https://twitter.com/jonsopel/status/1692936850824908994?s=42&amp;t=CP-tV_2DixDOz-AXnopIlA">Jon Sopel</a>, who tweeted: “Happy to accept might be impossible for the PM, given other commitments.

## Boygenius review – Phoebe Bridgers, Julien Baker and Lucy Dacus meet hysteria with humour

<p><strong>Gunnersbury Park, London</strong><br />The US supergroup have legions of fans swooning – literally – as they crown a summer of female cultural-dominance with an epic outdoor show</p><p>If there is a better after-party to England losing the World Cup on Sunday morning than seeing Boygenius play to 25,000 fans, it’s hard to picture it. The US songwriting supergroup of Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers and Lucy Dacus trade in both intimate commiserations and a celebration of female interdependence that runs counter to the concept of singular male brilliance that gave them their cheeky band name. They chose Irish songwriter <a href="https://music.youtube.com/channel/UC-Y7eF7wB80dLjgILw0VsRg">Soak</a>, US alt-pop star <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/07/ethel-cain-preachers-daughter-interview">Ethel Cain</a> and pop trio <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jun/26/muna-muna-review-pulsating-with-newfound-freedom">Muna</a> to support them today: all queer artists, a bill reflected in a very polite crowd primarily comprised of girls, goths and gays (and England shirts). This spiritual sister to Lilith Fair feels like an apt conclusion to a summer defined by women succeeding on an epic scale, from the England squad to blockbuster, headline-dominating tours by Taylor Swift, Beyoncé and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/14/sza-review-voyage-of-a-lifetime-with-genre-busting-rb-superstar">SZA</a>, to Greta Gerwig’s Barbie painting the box office pink.</p><p>Gunnersbury Park is, Baker estimates, the trio’s biggest show ever, and there’s almost something incongruous about it: these three songwriters often sing in close-woven harmonies, and keep a similarly tight lyrical focus, from an imminent ex’s unbearable “keys on the counter, your dirty dish in the sink” in Dacus’s Please Stay, to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0utmCIxfHgc">Emily I’m Sorry</a>, a Bridgers-led track about a crisis in the back seat of a car that seems to shudder with the precariousness of the situation. They have just one EP and an album, this year’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/02/boygenius-the-record-review-julien-baker-phoebe-bridgers-lucy-dacus">The Record</a>, and many of their Americana-tinged songs proceed with a crushed, under-covers smallness, or a nostalgic dreaminess reminiscent of Sheryl Crow’s 90s hits. Yet the response among the crowd is one of abject hysteria – there are tattoos of Bridgers’ lyrics, and a woman wearing wings to cosplay as the lyric “always an angel, never a god” – reflecting a generational hunger to hear these small, never-ending embarrassments blown up sky-sized. One of the biggest yell-alongs comes in Emily I’m Sorry, as Bridgers sings, “I’m 27 and I don’t know who I am.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/21/boygenius-review-phoebe-bridgers-julien-baker-and-lucy-dacus-meet-hysteria-with-humour">Continue reading...</a>

So right there, there’s a problem.</p><p>If Donald Trump is leading in the polls, and he’s your opponent, then kissing his butt is not going to help you win.</p><p>Had a great time in Des Moines [Iowa] yesterday or this week at the Iowa state fair. And what people want is someone who’s willing to be honest. What people want is folks that are not afraid of Donald Trump and who are going to articulate a vision for a future and talk about the issues of the day that are impacting them, and not just focusing on Donald Trump’s legal baggage.</p><p>Here’s what we’re learning. There’s a good chunk of people that are never going to vote for Donald Trump, and there’s folks that like Donald Trump, voted for him twice, still like him as a person, and don’t think he has a chance in a rematch against Joe Biden.</p><p>And that’s what I’m looking forward to talking about: not only his problems but articulating what the GOP needs to be doing, so we prevent a trend that has been happening for the last 20 years. And that’s losing the general election popular vote.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2023/aug/21/trump-republican-debate-georgia-biden-hawaii-fires-politics-live-updates">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Is Elon Musk’s vision for the future a libertarian fantasy or scientific imperative?</p><p>The question of human settlement on Mars is, for many people, not “if” but “when”. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk" title="">Elon Musk</a>’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/spacex" title="">SpaceX</a> company began speaking of the Mars Colonial Transporter around 2012. Its latest incarnation, the prototype for a massive spaceship called Starship that can house up to 100 passengers and crew, took off from Texas in April but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/apr/20/elon-musks-spacex-launches-test-flight-for-rocket-that-could-bring-people-to-mars" title="">exploded before reaching Earth’s orbit</a>. Whether that counts as a success or not depends on who you ask, but it testifies to Musk’s determination to see a human presence on Mars in the next decade.</p><p>His view that colonising the cosmos is humankind’s ultimate and inevitable destiny is widely shared. The moon, lacking an atmosphere, short on water, and with weak gravity, is not a very attractive stepping stone, but Mars has none of those drawbacks and is considered a much more viable place to build the first off-world settlement. “Once the exclusive province of science fiction stories and films,” <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/hq/library/find/bibliographies/space_colonization" title="">according to Nasa</a>, “the subject of space colonisation has rapidly moved several steps closer to becoming a reality thanks to major advances in rocket propulsion and design, astronautics and astrophysics, robotics and medicine.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/21/the-big-idea-should-we-colonise-other-planets">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>The O2, London<br /></strong>Arriving 90 minutes late, Asake seems frustrated during his too-safe set, which included a tribute to the two people killed at his last show in the capital<strong><br /><br /></strong></p><p>Much is staked on Asake’s return to London tonight. Outside, police approach attendees asking if they attended the Nigerian Afrobeats superstar’s show in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/21/asake-concert-crush-what-happened-london-brixton-o2">Brixton last December</a>, where a crush killed two people, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/14/brixton-o2-academy-will-remain-shut-while-police-investigate-crush">Gaby Hutchinson and Rebecca Ikumelo</a>, and if they would be prepared to give evidence. It’s a confronting reminder that the events of that night are still subject to an ongoing investigation. The wisdom of an arguably premature return to London already in question, it’s in Asake’s interests to be sensitive and deliver on the back of his acclaimed new album, the texturally rich, hook-laden <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/15/asake-work-of-art-review#:~:text=Every%20song%20on%20Work%20of,Believe%20is%20a%20striking%20earworm.">Work of Art</a>.</p><p>But the show is immediately mired by his lateness, a full 90 minutes after he was due on stage, leaving him just 35 minutes to perform. There is speculation that this is due to concerns over crowd control outside the venue. (On a livestream of the gig, Asake says: “Safety is my top priority tonight.”) When the show does begin, it starts with a tribute to Hutchinson and Ikumelo: actors dressed in white flood the stage, Aina More gives a spoken-word performance detailing the events in December and news footage plays in the background. It merges into an appeal by the Metropolitan police, and feels cold and artless: Ikumelo’s sister <a href="https://gbr01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Frachaeliku_%2Fstatus%2F1693398185052418310&amp;data=05%7C01%7C%7C1b7456ad45864d1878aa08dba21a281c%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C638282005453612578%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=kWgqkAWknmDHJ4XZqOiLYw%2FMVd%2Bozpaw4q26HQD1zdw%3D&amp;reserved=0">has since said</a> that Asake has not kept in touch with her family, despite using her personal videos in his show.

<p>These criminal entanglements are not only means but ends – not a sideshow, but the heart and soul of Trump’s campaign</p><p>On 16 or perhaps 17 July 2024, in Milwaukee, the Republican national convention will likely nominate as its presidential candidate a convicted criminal. When Donald Trump ascends the podium to accept the nomination for his third time he will probably have been found guilty months earlier of having staged an attempted coup to overthrow American democracy – “conspiring to overturn the legitimate results of the 2020 presidential election, obstruct the certification of the election results, and discount citizens’ legitimate votes”, in the words of special counsel Jack Smith.</p><p>The US district court judge Tanya Chutkan has announced that she will set the trial date at the next hearing on Trump’s case on 28 August. Smith has sought a 2 January 2024 start date for a trial to last an estimated six weeks into mid-February. Trump’s attorneys have preposterously suggested a date in April 2026. If Judge Chutkan fixes the trial for any time before 1 June 2024, Trump will accept the Republican nomination after its verdict is rendered.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/21/trump-election-giuliani-sidney-blumenthal">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This drama about an underdog-understudy forced to clean studios has real ballet dancers but the story is less realistic than Angelina Ballerina</p><p>This saccharine drama pivots around aspiring ballerina Sam (Juliet Doherty), who we meet as she is about to go on stage to dance in a production of The Red Shoes (presumably a version of the Matthew Bourne ballet-drama). But in one of those dramatic twists of fate that would set even the Brothers Grimm’s eyes rolling, her sister Annie calls to wish her good luck seconds before she takes the stage – and then promptly gets hit and killed by a passing car.</p><p>Obviously, this rather ruins Sam’s big night, and she gives up on dancing altogether. She subsequently falls in with a teenage tearaway named Eve (Lauren Esposito) who, like Sam, is a young American living in Australia for reasons left inexplicably vague. A sequence of screenwriting contrivances wash Sam back up at her old dance academy, run by termagant dance mistress Miss Harlow (Carolyn Bock, a hoot), and Sam is compelled to wash the floors as a form of community service for a shoplifting offence. Whaddya know; before long she’s back in the toe shoes, taking over a role when mean-girl rival Gracie (Primrose Kern) is injured and it turns out only Sam knows the choreography.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/21/the-red-shoes-next-step-review-corny-ballet-themed-drama-can-bust-a-move">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Very wonderful, very toxic’: how AI became the culture war’s new frontier

<p>While the far right claims artificial intelligence has become too ‘woke’, experts argue it’s not a sentient being with its own viewpoints</p><p>When Elon Musk introduced the team behind his new artificial intelligence company xAI last month, the billionaire entrepreneur took a question from the rightwing media activist Alex Lorusso.

## New York is building the world’s tallest jail in Chinatown. Can anyone stop it?

<p>Planners say the facility will help heal the criminal justice system. But local residents see a brutal symbol of incarceration</p><p>For nearly two centuries, New York City’s Chinatown has been home to a quintessentially American story: immigrant workers and their families living shoulder-to-shoulder in low-slung tenements. Workers like Dennis Chung, the owner of Pasteur Grill and Noodles, a Vietnamese pho joint he’s run at the neighborhood’s western edge for 27 years – weathering disasters like 9/11, Hurricane Sandy and Covid.</p><p>Now another symbol of the American condition is taking shape, directly across from Chung’s shop: a vast new jail. At about 300ft, the new structure is expected to be the tallest correctional facility in the world. And Chung says it could be the thing that finally sinks his business. “With the jail on top of the pandemic, it might be over,” he tells me in Cantonese.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/21/new-york-jail-chinatown-rikers-island">Continue reading...</a>

## Rachel Roddy’s recipe for bread, tomato, cucumber and watermelon salad | A kitchen in Rome

<p>An ancient solution for using up old bread – panzanella – forms the backbone of this attractive, textured southern Italian salad </p><p>The first time I visited Jo’s house, there was something soaking in a tub on the draining board. From a distance it looked like sponges, or short sections of the natural loofah that hung around our bathroom in the 1980s, which, at the time, reminded me of a chewed corn on the cob. But, up close, I realised it was bits of bread floating like rafts in the blue tub of water.</p><p>I don’t think I had ever heard the word <em>panzanella</em> before. Jo explained that age dictates the quantity of water: the older the bread, the more it requires. Several days-old bread needs only swishing under a tap to dampen it back to life, while older, <em>raffermato</em> – that is, firmed-up-but-still-rippable – bread needs a cup or so of water pouring over. Hard or rock-hard bread, meanwhile – the sort that seems to say: “Go on, try me” to both hands and knives – needs fully soaking and/or immersion for the water to penetrate the crumb and make it soft again. This is also why, once softened, the bread needs squeezing, so the final consistency is damp crumbs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/aug/21/bread-tomato-cucumber-and-watermelon-salad-recipe-rachel-roddy">Continue reading...</a>

My mother took me to the local animal rescue centre, just to have a look at the dogs we could adopt. The moment Sylvester saw us, his whole body started wagging, not just his tail.</p><p>He was a mongrel who had been abandoned by his previous owner but it was obvious from the length of his body that one of his parents must have been a dachshund – and whenever he was excited, as he was that day, his whole body would waggle back and forth around his head with joy, in a sort of S-shape.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/aug/21/the-pet-i-will-never-forget-sylvester-the-dog">Continue reading...</a>

## Let’s ditch the tired tropes about video games – and research their impact properly | Pete Etchells

<p>No, gaming isn’t a niche, violence-inducing pastime, it’s the defining entertainment medium of our time. We should treat it as such</p><p>Over the past few years, it feels as if there has been a subtle shift in the way that we view video games. That classic trope of games being a socially isolating experience, primarily within the purview of angry, pallid teenage boys, seems increasingly tired and outdated – because it is. Video games are no longer a niche, nerdy pastime. Much the opposite: they are one of, or perhaps <em>the</em> defining entertainment medium of the 21st century. <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/number-of-gamers">One estimate</a> puts the total number of people across the globe who play video games at 3.09 billion, with <a href="https://www.theesa.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2022-Essential-Facts-About-the-Video-Game-Industry.pdf">data from the US</a> suggesting that two-thirds of American adults play them, with a fairly even split between men and women.</p><p>But, even though we’ve moved past the most strongly negative characterisations of video games and become more accustomed to them, they’re still viewed with a certain level of suspicion. And we’re still presented with a seemingly endless cycle of scare stories in the news about their detrimental effects. I’m a firm believer in the huge potential of video games as a force for good in our lives, and I’ve <a href="https://iconbooks.com/ib-title/lost-in-a-good-game/">written before</a> about the benefits they can have – their ability to connect us and to allow us to explore and understand our emotions and attitudes. Nevertheless, the broad-level discussion about their impact seems to be at an impasse: games are becoming ever more popular, while commenters are often stuck in a simplistic back and forth about whether they are good or bad for us.</p><p>Pete Etchells is a professor of psychology and science communication at Bath Spa University.

<p>Giving up on eternal life made me realise I had one chance to achieve something meaningful. For me, that was a submission of a different kind</p><p>“Are you the people who don’t have blood transfusions?” was the first thing most people asked if any of us mentioned our religion. We weren’t supposed to say “yes”, because we weren’t meant to allow our faith to be defined by what we didn’t do. We were supposed to emphasise the positives, such as the promise of eternal life on Earth.</p><p>But the inconvenient fact was that we weren’t<em> </em>allowed blood transfusions.

<p>A few pots of thyme, basil, nasturtiums or marigolds can lift a late-summer baked chicken, a green bean salad, or peaches and honey</p><p>August, and the garden comes into the kitchen. Basil that has basked in the sun all summer long is used with lemon zest to season baked marrow; dill flavours a citrus dressing for prawns, and the dried leaves of thyme, mint and lavender buds add fragrance to a dish of baked chicken. Now is also time to roast peaches or apricots with thyme and honey, and bring edible flowers – there are more than you may think – into the kitchen to add a summer fragrance to leafy salads.</p><p>I grow herbs in pots, in light, gritty compost to provide the fine, nutritionally poor soil on which rosemary, thyme and marjoram do so well. Those that benefit from richer soil, the basil and mint family, still need good drainage (herbs hate getting their feet wet) so growing in pots is ideal, as you can provide the soil they like best.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/aug/21/nigel-slater-recipes-homegrown-herbs-flowers-baked-chicken-peaches-honey">Continue reading...</a>

Having spent 11 years as a tennis professional, scaling the top 10 in singles and doubles, she is not far from being classed as a veteran of her sport.

Now 43, her passion for the sport is so great that her motivation is undimmed. Williams trailed by a double break in both sets, 1-4 in the first set and 1-5 in the second, before recovering to win 6-4, 7-5 and secure her first top-20 win in four years.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/aug/21/venus-williams-and-stan-wawrinka-lead-posse-of-inspirational-veterans">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh</strong><br />Abdulrashid is emerging as one of comedy’s most honest chroniclers of life’s complexities and contradictions</p><p>There are few acts in Edinburgh right now quite like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/mar/02/bgt-standup-sensation-nabil-abdulrashid-black-winston-churchill-complaints">Nabil Abdulrashid</a> – perhaps because he avoided the fringe (partly by choice, partly financial exigency) until deep into his career. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toJEByRJeGQ">Britain’s Got Talent finalist</a> has not had his instincts moulded over years of engagement with a festival that is, generally speaking, white, middle-class and liberal. Does that sound like I’m making excuses for a comic with more rough edges than a sanding block? Well, I find the 37-year-old such an interesting standup: now thoughtful, now misanthropic; aggressive but tender; and always marked by a bloody-minded refusal to play to anyone’s rules but his own.</p><p>There’s no point pretending The Purple Pill is a structured and coherent hour; it isn’t. And there’s plenty in it that I find off-putting. Abdulrashid ranting at opportunistic comics with newly diagnosed ADHD, or sneering at reviewers who’ve criticised his work? That all lands a bit self-righteously for me. When he blames the audience for laughing at his corporal punishment jokes – well, that’s a rich cake to have and eat at once.</p><p>At <a href="https://www.pleasance.co.uk/event/nabil-abdulrashid-purple-pill">Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh</a>, until 27 August</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/edinburgh-festival-2023+tone/reviews">All our Edinburgh festival reviews</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/21/nabil-abdulrashid-the-purple-pill-review-blt-finalist">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Pep Guardiola has invented another new role, while Fulham are hoping to reinvigorate Raúl Jiménez </p><p>Nicolas Jackson looks a lovely footballer, an intelligent runner with soft feet, physical prowess and a lively imagination. But he is not – yet – a killer, enjoying the aesthetic beauty of the game more than the front-post runs, penalty-spot pulls and scuffed finishes that must become his stock in trade; no serious centre-forward should allow Enzo Fernández to claim what should be the certain goal of a spot-kick. Alongside him, meanwhile, Raheem Sterling is unlikely to score prolifically in any team not managed by Pep Guardiola. When you factor in Christopher Nkunku’s injury, Mykhailo Mudryk and Noni Madueke’s callowness and Mauricio Pochettino’s preferred 3-5-2 formation, it’s hard to see how Chelsea will be prolific enough to do serious damage this season. On the other hand, though, Moisés Caicedo will soon settle despite a disastrous debut cameo, and any team that has him, Fernández and Carney Chukwuemeka on the prowl in front of three centre-backs should have enough to win most games. <strong>Daniel Harris</strong></p><p><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2023/aug/20/west-ham-v-chelsea-premier-league-live">West Ham 3-1 Chelsea: match report</a></em></p><p><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/19/manchester-city-newcastle-premier-league-match-report">Manchester City 1-0 Newcastle: match report</a></em></p><p><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/19/tottenham-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report">Tottenham 2-0 Manchester United: match report</a></em></p><p><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/19/wolves-brighton-premier-league-match-report">Wolves 1-4 Brighton: match report</a></em></p><p><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/19/liverpool-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report">Liverpool 3-1 Bournemouth: match report</a></em></p><p><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/20/aston-villa-everton-premier-league-match-report">Aston Villa 4-0 Everton: match report</a></em></p><p><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/19/fulham-brentford-premier-league-match-report">Fulham 0-3 Brentford: match report</a></em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/21/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Archaeologists fear dangerous precedent if court approves new beach facilities at site of Phaselis on the Mediterranean coast</p><p>The construction of tourist facilities on two beaches that were part of the ancient city of Phaselis – a tentative nominee for Unesco world heritage status – has caused outrage at what is claimed to be the latest example of the Turkish culture ministry sacrificing heritage for tourism.</p><p>The Alacasu and Bostanlık beaches, on Turkey’s southern Mediterranean coast in the province of Antalya, were part of Phaselis, a Greek and Roman settlement thought to be the birthplace of Plato’s student Theodectes. Despite having ruins dating back to the second century BC, the beaches have never been subject to an archaeological dig.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/21/outrage-at-plans-to-develop-turkeys-cultural-heritage-sites">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The year Joy France turned 60, she pledged to try 60 new things. It led to her trading insults with MCs on the international stage</p><p>As a child, Joy France was so shy that she walked to school with her hands over her eyes, believing no one would see she was there. Now 66, she is an international battle rapper who raps in front of huge crowds. “I think I’m the oldest battle rapper in the world,” she says. She has battle rapped – a form in which rappers insult each other and make boasts – in England and Ireland, in the <a href="https://www.dontflop.com/">Don’t Flop</a> league (one of the UK’s biggest leagues). In the process, she has become “the exact opposite of what I was”.</p><p>France made her debut in 2018 at a club in Coventry –<strong> </strong>“stepping into a world that I was terrified of,” she says, so nervous that she came out in a rash. Before the battle – recorded by Northern Heart Films for a short documentary – France contacted her opponent and urged: “Do whatever you would do for any other contestant.” He obliged, rapping a joke about her genitals.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/aug/21/a-new-start-after-60-im-a-short-greying-woman-and-the-worlds-oldest-battle-rapper">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The nation relies on tourism, yet many local people feel the right to enjoy these timeless places is being denied them</p><p>It was mid-August 1997; I was in my 20s and heading from Athens to the Aegean island of Sifnos with three friends. We hopped on a ship at the port of Piraeus and sailed out into the blue waters. Arriving late in the evening, we spent that first night on the beach, close to the port of Kamares.</p><p>It was bliss: the lapping of gentle waves a few metres away and the distant music from the bars as we gazed at the stars and the blazing meteors crashing through the atmosphere. You felt you were shedding your old skin like a reptile; it was painful and liberating; it was existential.</p><p>Elias Maglinis is an author and the arts editor of the Sunday edition of the Greek newspaper Kathimerini.

## Powerless in the face of Britain’s crises, Rishi Sunak has now entered his self-pitying era | Nesrine Malik

<p>The prime minister has the condescending air of a man who believes he is doing the public a favour by governing us</p><p>We are used to the fact that Rishi Sunak only has two speeds: blandly repeating his five political “priorities” and dutifully affirming the nastiest of his party’s rhetoric. When he’s not answering questions by reciting the five pledges, he’s attacking lefty lawyers, “woke nonsense” or inventing cruel ways to detain and deport asylum seekers. Both, to a certain extent, are performances: the robotic recitations to make clear that, after a series of reckless Tory prime ministers, a grownup is back in charge. The rightwing populist setting, meanwhile, is designed for his own party and the Tory press.</p><p>But sometimes another Sunak appears in flashes in a third speed: the self-pitying and frustrated prime minister. One who seems to say: look, you don’t understand how much I’m sacrificing for you people.</p><p>Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/21/rishi-sunak-britain-crisis-self-pitying-era">Continue reading...</a>
