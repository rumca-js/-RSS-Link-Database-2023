Singapore's penal code, says the publisher, defines rashly as when someone acts despite knowing there is a risk that they will be participating in a criminal act.\n\nThe other legislation holds people responsible for negligence. A reasonable person would know that they should take an action to stop an apparent crime but did not.

The legality of the scheme is being reviewed by the UK\u2019s information commissioner.\n\nThe Scottish police have said that digital evidence-sharing is limited and does not include fingerprint, bodycam or DNA evidence. The pilot is part of a \u00a333 \u00admillion (US$42 million) Scottish government initiative to transform how evidence is managed across the justice system.\n\nThis is not the first time Plastow has sounded an alarm over stored biometric data. Earlier this year, after the commissioner <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202304/scottish-biometrics-commissioner-seeks-clarity-on-police-cloud-data-sharing-compliance\">found</a> that the police had stored large amounts of biometric data from arrests on Microsoft servers, the Scottish Police Authority agreed to <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/scottish-police-reprimanded-for-illegally-storing-biometrics\">accept his recommendations</a>.

Banks are also using biometrics as an internal control, securing staff access to sensitive data and restricted areas.\n\nFingerprints are the most common modality of choice for bank biometrics due to their speed, ease of use, high accuracy and cost-effective nature.\n\nFor example, <a href=\"https://www.hidglobal.com/documents/banco-supervielle-biometric-authentication-case-study\">Banco Superveille</a> in Argentina uses fingerprints to verify the identity of pensioners collecting their benefits. Before adopting biometrics, the bank could only prevent fraudulent claims by the relatives of deceased pensioners by making all claimants go through a time-consuming authentication process. The decisions made by Banco Superveille to use fingerprint authentication present a good real-world example for other organizations to provide a more secure and better experience for staff and pensioners.\n<h2>The benefits of biometrics in banking</h2>\nThe security and compliance benefits of biometrics are significant drivers of the technology\u2019s adoption among financial institutions. All banks are subject to know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations that involve identity verification to a high level of assurance for new customers.\n\nBiometrics are one of the few ways of meeting the identity assurance standard these regulations require. An in-person fingerprint scan is the same method of identity verification the U.S. federal government uses to perform background checks.\n\nThe strength of identity assurance that provides regulatory compliance also protects against fraud. High-accuracy fingerprint scanners can provide this security and compliance, while improving the customer experience.\n\nAs an emerging technology, fingerprint biometrics can also help to build the brand of organizations that adopt them. The use of advanced technology creates confidence in many customers and demonstrates the bank is not stuck in the past.\n<h2>Choosing the right fingerprint scanner for your bank</h2>\nThe standards behind KYC and AML regulations cannot be met with the fingerprint scanner on a mobile phone. Instead, banks deploy dedicated hardware to achieve the benefits of biometrics within branches.\n\nAs a relatively mature biometric modality, there are standards used throughout the world for fingerprints, notably including the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s Next Generation Identification (NGI) Image Quality Specifications (IQS). The common standard for image quality assessment is provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).\n\n<a href=\"https://fbibiospecs.fbi.gov/certifications-1/cpl\">The FBI</a> standards are often referred to in procurements around the world, with for instance the PIV (Personal Identity Verification) specification ensuring interoperability and quality of single finger scanners used for one-to-one biometric matching. The NIST Fingerprint Image Quality (NFIQ) 2 is open source software for assessing the quality of fingerprint images, with reference to the <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/standard/62791.html\">ISO/IEC 29794-4</a> standard for biometric sample quality.\n\nBanks in many countries must also adhere to <a href=\"https://fbibiospecs.fbi.gov/certifications-1/cpl\">mandates</a> and fit into ecosystems that involve the specifications used for national ID cards.\n\nThe right biometric scanner must also provide sufficient accuracy to work at scale, while providing the right user experience. A financial institution with tens of millions of customers must match only the correct user to their account. While fingerprint biometrics tend to have low false accept rates, in which the wrong person would get into an account, cheap fingerprint scanners have higher false rejection rates, in which the legitimate customer is not matched. Scans should work the first time to deliver the kind of confidence and experience customers expect.\n\nFor example, Banco Superveille selected <a href=\"https://www.hidglobal.com/documents/multispectral-imaging-msi-fingerprint-technology-white-paper\">fingerprint readers powered by multispectral imaging (MSI) technology</a> so they could consistently match the aging fingers of elderly customers in any challenging lighting conditions and harsh environments, and the bank was able to authenticate more than a million retirees faster than expected with fingerprint scanners.\n\nLiveness detection is another important consideration, providing protection against relatively sophisticated fraud attacks. Fingerprint scanners that use advanced imaging, like <a href=\"https://www.hidglobal.com/documents/multispectral-imaging-msi-fingerprint-technology-white-paper\">MSI</a>, can provide this capability, which is not available with some low price fingerprint scanners.\n\nThe standard for liveness, or presentation attack detection (PAD), is <a href=\"https://blog.hidglobal.com/2023/05/side-step-fingerprint-spoofs-iso-30107-3-pad-level-2-compliance\">ISO/IEC 30107</a>. Testing for compliance to this standard is available from independent laboratories and shows the effectiveness of biometric systems against attacks with varying levels of sophistication. The highest level of testing against this standard from NIST-accredited labs is ISO 30107-3 PAD Level 2, which moves beyond simplistic fakes to consider effectiveness against 3D prosthetics and sophisticated fakes made with silicone and latex.\n\nIndependent PAD Level 2 testing to the ISO standard illustrates another way in which multispectral fingerprint scanners such as HID\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/hid-globals-multispectral-fingerprint-scanners-score-perfect-level-2-pad-assessment\">Lumidigm V-Series</a> are appropriate for high-security use cases like bank transactions.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.hidglobal.com/documents/ebook-definitive-guide-fingerprint-technology\">Multispectral fingerprint scanners</a> have been proven effective for use cases where security, consistency and accuracy are important. Leading biometrics device providers can help financial institutions integrate advanced fingerprint scanners into their business processes for improved security and customer experience.\n\nTightening regulations, increasing fraud concerns, and advances in biometric technology combine to make this the appropriate time for many of the banks and financial institutions that have not yet adopted fingerprints for in-branch identity verification to do so.\n\nRead HID\u2019s recent eBook, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/a-definitive-guide-to-fingerprint-technology\">A Definitive Guide to Fingerprint Technology</a>,\u201d to explore popular fingerprint sensing technologies, common use cases and a checklist on key considerations for selecting the right readers for your bank.\n<h2>About the author</h2>\nVito Fabbrizio is Managing Director of the Biometrics Business Unit at <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/hid-global\">HID Global</a>.\n\n<em>DISCLAIMER: Biometric Update\u2019s Industry Insights are submitted content.

For many people, it will change their lives,\u201d Amanda Rishworth, minister for social services <a href=\"https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/betstop-problem-gamblers-will-be-able-to-self-exclude-from-betting-platforms/59kxqobdt\">explained </a>to SBS News in July.\n\nOnline gambling is the fastest-growing gambling segment in Australia, with over AU$1.4 billion (US$895 million) gambled online each year. Identity verification is aimed at preventing vulnerable people who have banned themselves from using an alias to place a bet. The new rules will apply to all 150 licensed Australian online betting companies.\n\nUnder the guidelines <a href=\"https://www.dss.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/05_2022/national-policy-statement-updated-3-may-2022.docx\">outlined</a> by the National Consumer Protection Framework for Online Wagering in Australia, interactive wagering operators will be required to verify each customers' identity when they sign up and before they can place a bet.\n\nWagering operators will have 72 hours to complete identity verification and KYC checks on players, much quicker than previously required. Operators will also have to close accounts immediately if a customer is verified as a person under 18 years of age. People also can\u2019t self-exclude from one platform and not others.\n\nThe platform is managed by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA).\n\nFace biometrics are <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/australian-gaming-operator-calls-for-coordination-on-facial-recognition-for-restrictions\">already used</a> for gambling restrictions in South Australia, Queensland and New South Wales, including for physical locations such as pubs and clubs.

The move to adopt biometrics for staff entry, orchestrated over two years by NFL's senior VP of security, Cathy Lanier, seeks to digitize and bolster the existing system that regulates access for workers, vendors, and media during games.\n\nLanier compares the NFL\u2019s security measures to the complexity of the <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/olympics\">Olympics</a>, highlighting the intricacies of access zones and timing. Access to the field, for instance, is segmented into 20 different time slots. So, someone cleared two hours before kickoff might not have post-game access.\n\nSays Lanier, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of holes in the current system. It\u2019s a system that\u2019s outdated and has a lot of vulnerabilities. It\u2019s easy to pass a fake credential off. It\u2019s difficult for security personnel to read a complex credential that\u2019s got 27 different codes on it.\u201d\n\nThe NFL plans to employ <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/wicket\">Wicket's</a> facial authentication technology, already adopted by the <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/wickets-biometric-ticketing-gives-cleveland-browns-fans-some-relief\">Browns</a> for fan entry, to cross-check digital photos against real-time facial scans. Real-time face biometrics authentication software will make it far more challenging to transfer credentials illicitly, a common form of fraud. Every scan will produce a straightforward red or green signal for security staff, reducing the risk of human error at checkpoints.\n\nWicket was ranked towards the top of NIST\u2019s FRVT 1:1 <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/us-facial-recognition-developers-jockey-for-position-in-nist-accuracy-testing\">leaderboard as of mid-2023</a>, with an algorithm submitted in early 2022.\n\nBy the Super Bowl, the league will assess the pilot's performance. Brandon Covert, Browns\u2019 VP of IT, noted that the technology has already proven successful at their training facility. There, it has eliminated the players\u2019 need to remember their security cards and made things faster. \u201cIt\u2019s been a tremendous success for us,\u201d Covert says.\n\nCovert estimates that around 500 individuals, primarily full-time team, NFL staff, and media, will use face biometrics on game days this season.

The ID cards are issued to Liberians six years old and above.\n\nThe renewal entails capturing the biometric data of those concerned for the issuance of highly secured biometric national ID cards with a unique number which will be used as a social security number.\n\nWith the ID card, holders will have access to a range of services such as birth and death registrations, applications for passports and residential credentials, as well as for bank account opening.\n\nPeters said while the low renewal rate is due largely to the unwillingness of Liberians, lack of support from relevant stakeholders such as government ministries, department and agencies, and private sector partners, is also not helping the situation.\n\nThe official said the NIR needs the full support of government and other partners to enable it open more enrollment centers in all the 15 counties of the country. Already, each of the counties has a well-equipped enrollment center, the NIR says. The official also urged the government to expand the database capacity of the NIR to be able to contain the data of all registrants.\n\nMeanwhile, early this month, Peters stated that the NIR has the intention of taking the number of Liberians with a national ID card to one million by year end.\n\nHe noted that as part of the plan, the body has been in talks with other government agencies and partners to facilitate the process of issuing ID cards for their staff, The New Dawn writes in a different <a href=\"https://thenewdawnliberia.com/national-registry-unveils-plans-to-register-more-liberians/\">report</a>.\n\nPeters said a technical committee had been set up, in collaboration with the Liberia Institute for Statistics and Geo-Information Services (LISGIS), to make things work.

He believes that \u201cby embracing technology-driven solutions, Pakistan can promote transparency, accountability, and timely electoral outcomes.\u201d\n\nIn his article, \"Buttons To Ballots: Technology and Pakistan\u2019s Elections,\"\u00a0Malik, who is also a former chief technical advisor at the UNDP, notes that by making the most of cutting-edge technology, the country can surmount geographical barriers, streamline the elections management process, and improve security measures, which are all necessary for entrenching trust in the democratic process.\n\n\u201cI believe that using digital technology can enhance electoral integrity. In Pakistan, the integration of technology into electoral politics holds tremendous potential for enhancing access, efficiency, security, and integrity in the electoral process,\u201d Malik posits.\n\nHe acknowledges that while efforts have already been made to set the template for technology-driven elections in Pakistan through the \u201cOne CNIC \u2013 One Vote\u201d principle championed by NADRA which increased voter participation and inclusion, the process can be made better.\n\n\u201cThe integration of technology also promises to significantly increase the efficiency of elections in Pakistan. Biometric voter authentication systems can expedite the identification process, leading to smoother and faster voting procedures,\u201d Malik writes.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, automating data collection and management can enhance efficiency in election administration, facilitating the verification of voter lists, monitoring campaign finances, and ensuring compliance with electoral regulations.\u201d\n\nEmphasizing the aspect of security, the ex-NADRA boss states: \u201ctechnology can play a crucial role in fortifying Pakistan\u2019s electoral system. Implementing robust cybersecurity measures, encryption protocols, and secure communication channels, can minimize the risk of tampering with voter data, results and critical election infrastructure.\u201d\n\nFor all of these innovations to be introduced however, Malik says it is important for the Pakistani government to put in place the requisite legal framework and institutional and infrastructural investment plan.\n\nHe also suggests that given the \u201coverpowering reactions against some radical reforms in the past, a transitional approach with vertical integration of technology in electoral processes seems to be a more viable option in Pakistan.\u201d\n\nWith foundational blocks already in place, Malik holds that it is worthwhile to bring in innovations that cover all aspects of the electoral cycle including \u201cdata analytics for predictive analysis, real-time monitoring through video surveillance systems, education and awareness through online platforms, mobile applications and social media campaigns, among others.\u201d\n\nHe also urges political parties in the country to embrace digital innovations which can streamline how their services are accessed, what he calls a \u201cdigital vision.\u201d", "link": "https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/ex-nadra-chair-argues-more-biometrics-use-can-greatly-improve-pakistans-elections", "date_published": "2023-08-21T15:38:06+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/biometricupdate", "title": "Biometrics Institute announces online public discussion on ethical use of AI", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"1366\" src=\"https://d1sr9z1pdl3mb7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/30185300/algorithms-facial-recognition-bias-crowd-scaled.jpg\" width=\"2048\" />\n\t\tOn September 13, the <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/biometrics-institute\">Biometrics Institute</a> will hold an hour-long virtual discussion on different aspects related to Artificial Intelligence, biometrics, privacy and ethics.\n\nDubbed \u201c<a href=\"https://www.biometricsinstitute.org/event/on-the-pulse-conversation-biometrics-privacy-ethics/\">On The Pulse (OTP) Conversation</a>,\u201d the event to take place from 7:30-8:30 a.m. BST, will be open to members of the public, and will examine the responsible and ethical use of AI and biometrics, the Institute says in an announcement.
