		Single sign-on authentication service has been switched on for all services that the autocratic Arab Emirates offers online.

The <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/digital-id-in-uae-milestone-hit-ministry-service-launched">UAE Pass</a>, which was extended to 6,000 government and private-sector services this month, was kicked off in February 2021. At that time, the government <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202104/governments-advance-digital-identity-services-in-germany-uae-seychelles">promised</a> verified accounts could be created in under five minutes. It also set 6,000 services as a target.

The UAE is not alone. In East Africa, Kenyan officials <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/kenya-digitizes-5k-government-services-to-issue-digital-ids-in-next-90-days">say</a> as many as 5,000 government services can be accessed using a program called Gava Mkononi, which translates to government on touch. Now the task is to start issuing digital IDs in the next three months.

And the United Kingdom's digital ID, One Login, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/uks-one-login-still-has-competition-in-government">continues</a> to grow. As of this summer, it worked with 44 sign-in apps.

The UAE Pass is loaded on a phone as an Apple Store or Play app. A physical Emirates ID and the applicant's face are scanned for biometric verification. The Emirates ID card can be used to open bank accounts and get a mobile connection among other government and private sector tasks.

With the pass, people can access thousands of services through the phone without typing a user name or password, <a href="https://www.gulftoday.ae/news/2023/08/02/now-uae-pass-holders-can-have-access-to-over-6000-services-in-more-than-130-govt-private-entities">according to</a> Gulf Today, a regional news publication that pledges government deference.

At the same time, French medical data-analysis firm Visiomed says it is now collecting biometric identifiers for the Emirates ID physical card for the government.

<a href="https://www.visiomed-group.com/">Visiomed</a> already performs the medical fitness tests required of newcomers to the growing Gulf country.

The work is being done through a subsidiary, Smart Salem, which claims it is the only medical fitness centers working with the government that is able to ship test results and ID biometrics in 30 minutes from its three facilities. Smart Salem boasts that that is the fastest delivery in Dubai.

The company says it is working with the Dubai International Finance Centre to collect face templates, though does not spell out what the center will be doing.

		The Philippines Identification System (PhilSys), the country’s digital identity scheme, is making new strides in increasing the availability of its services. The island nation plans to use PhilSys and its identity card PhilID to fast-track the digital transformation of government services and the distribution of social benefits.

"The National ID System will be at the core of this digitally transformed network of government services,” President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said in July. “It will fundamentally change the lives of each Filipino. At 87 percent total registration, we are now closer to establishing a complete, accurate, and reliable digital database of our own for the entire population."

This week, the country kicked off a food stamp program called Walang Gutom 2027 in a district of its capital, Manila. The project is just one of the ways the Philippine government has been testing the integration of digital ID into social benefits. In July, the Philippine Statistics Authority signed a memorandum of understanding with the Social Security System to adopt PhilSys in social security services and transactions.

Social benefit platform Open Government-to-Person (OpenG2P) recently<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/openg2p-philsys-conduct-pilot-for-financial-inclusion-program-using-philid"> announced</a> the successful completion of a social welfare cash transfer pilot for the Assistance to Individuals in Crisis Situation program that started in March. The PhilSys registry has also been integrated into a database of potential social protection beneficiaries called the National Household Targeting System for Poverty Reduction or Listahanan.

Other government agencies have also pledged their support for ePhilID, the digital version of the PhilID card, including the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), the Department of Foreign Affairs and the central bank of the Philippines. The DSWD has<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/philippines-connects-homeless-to-government-services-with-biometrics-id-cards"> established</a> a central database of individuals living on the streets with the help of biometrics.

The country also hopes to increase the number of Filipinos with physical ID cards to 50 million by the end of 2023.

The Philippine Statistics Authority, which manages PhilSys and PhilID, said that over 80.2 million people have registered for an ID. Around 36 million have received physical cards, while 39.49 million have received the electronic version. However, issuing cards has been slowed down as the country needs more capacity to print them, CNN<a href="http://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2023/8/2/national-id-physical-card-printing.html"> reports</a>.

The Philippines has<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/a-tale-of-two-mosip-implementations-philippines-and-morocco"> built</a> its digital identity system on top of the Modular Open Source Identity Platform (<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/modular-open-source-identity-platform">MOSIP</a>).

## Worldcoin to make iris biometrics device design available to developers

		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/worldcoin">Worldcoin</a>, the company that aims to enroll the whole world in its <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/worldcoin">World ID</a> digital identity service, is exploring the decentralization of its proprietary biometric device that people use to scan their irises in exchange for some of its crypto tokens.

Open-sourcing the Orb will be a big focus for the company in the next 12 months, Worldcoin co-founder Alex Blania <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrF2LbuSYoA&amp;ab_channel=TheBlock">told</a> digital assets industry outlet The Block.

“You need other entities to essentially take the design of the Orb, build their own implementations of the Orb, and operate it,” says Blania. The other entities “can be really everything from small manufacturing companies to tech giants.”

The Orb was developed by a team at Tools for Humanity, the parent of Worldcoin. The engineers tested facial recognition, palm vein recognition and other prototypes before settling on iris scanning as the only option that was suitable for the scale of the project, according to Blania.

Worldcoin executives, who have enrolled more than<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/worldcoin-surpasses-2m-digital-id-signups-8b-to-go"> 2 million people</a>, want to scan the irises of all 8 billion people on Earth to verify their personhood. Their proof-of-personhood protocol can be used anonymously to prove uniqueness and humanness. In exchange for enrollment, the company is giving subscribers Worldcoin cryptocurrency, which <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/worldcoins-digital-id-linked-cryptocurrency-hits-the-markets">launched</a> in July.

The company has around 250 Orb devices in cities around the world and plans to ramp up their availability, despite warnings from some about the dangers of counterfeit devices. In March, it <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/220402/worldcoin-outsourcing-deal-jabil-iris-scanning-orbs">partnered</a> with Jabil, in the U.S. state of Florida, to increase Orb production in Germany.

Executives ultimately <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/worldcoin-says-will-allow-companies-governments-use-its-id-system-2023-08-02/">want</a> to build a massive financial and identity community, allowing others to use its technology. It’s aiming at unbanked people globally and has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/worldcoin-says-will-allow-companies-governments-use-its-id-system-2023-08-02/">pitched</a> itself as a solution to universal basic income and even “global democratic processes.”

Blania describes Worldcoin as the “cypherpunk alternative” to KYC, adding that his World ID could be used to authenticate anonymously for many online services.

“One of our theses from the beginning really was that the internet needs a foundational kind of proof-of-human, proof-of-personhood layer,” he says, “We essentially don't have another fundamental solution to the problem other than KYC government identities, and even those we don't have in many countries around the world, right?”

But critics caution that many countries may not want or need Silicon Valley-made identity and payments infrastructure. Some are building their own centralized system, such as the India Stack, which includes the country’s biometric ID system Aadhaar, and an open-source money transfer back-end called the Universal Payments Interface.

Governments may also find it hard to integrate Worldcoin’s vision of blockchain identity with their national infrastructure, trade publication Rest of World <a href="https://restofworld.org/2023/exporter-worldcoin-kenya-india-upi/">reports</a>. <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202301/india-expecting-gov-stack-upi-payments-to-go-global-as-7-countries-to-sign-up">Other countries</a> are already adopting the technology behind India’s UPI, with <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/indias-aadhaar-based-upi-payment-platform-allures-japan">Japan the latest</a> to express its interest.

India has made exporting its <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/india-presses-for-legal-framework-to-guide-adoption-of-digital-public-infrastructure">digital public infrastructure</a>, which includes UPI and the Aadhaar-enabled payment system (AePS), a priority of its foreign relations and G20 presidency.

Worldcoin is already <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/multiple-regulators-turn-gaze-to-worldcoins-iris-collection">seeing regulatory pushback</a> in the United Kingdom, France, Germany and elsewhere. Wednesday, Kenya, which has <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/kenya-unveils-details-on-new-digital-id-rollout-india-potential-partner">its own digital ID scheme</a> inspired by India Stack, announced it is <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/kenya-bans-worldcoin-activities-as-citizens-trade-biometrics-for-tokens">suspending</a> Worldcoin’s enrollments and cryptocurrency issuance while the government assesses its risk to the public. The company has paused registrations in Kenya.

The Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision says it has been investigating Worldcoin since November over its biometric data processing practices. The German agency is in charge of tracking the company’s compliance with European Union data protection rules because Tools For Humanity has a German headquarters.

		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/sterling-check">Sterling Check Corp</a>. has partnered with <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/id-me">ID.me</a> to launch a virtual I-9 document review service. The service will be integral to Sterling's existing I-9 solution, with ID.me Trusted Referees assessing documents virtually, securely, and conveniently, according to the announcement. This innovation will allow employers to remotely comply with employment eligibility requirements for new hires.

Dispensing with the conventional in-person review conducted by an employer or a third-party notary, ID.me's professional Trusted Referees will be on standby to undertake secure virtual document review on the employer's behalf. The ID.me Trusted Referees are trained and vetted to Department of Commerce standards for identity proofing as stipulated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/nist">NIST</a>), and already used by 14 federal and 35 state government agencies.

The virtual document review service will be exclusively available to both new and existing Sterling I-9 clients who are E-Verify users in good standing. The entirely remote process, capable of being completed in as little as 5-10 minutes, aligns with DHS and USCIS requirements. All documents examined by ID.me Trusted Referees will be securely stored with other I-9 documents in the Sterling system for employers' auditing needs.

Josh Peirez, CEO of Sterling, acknowledged the need for a more modern, secure I-9 document verification process, stating, "Sterling's new virtual review service will redefine the I-9 document verification experience for the virtual work environment."

Blake Hall, CEO of ID.me, praised the DHS for modernizing onboarding processes and stated, "Our Trusted Referees are expertly trained to examine identity documents, and this service can help thousands of employers to efficiently comply with DHS requirements by leveraging video chat to complete Form I-9."

## Biometric system good enough for Liberia voter registration, not voting yet — govt

		IT vendors have long told prospects that the lead dog in a running pack gets the best view, but the slowest dogs are least likely to plunge off a cliff.

Liberia's National Elections Commission appears happy forego the view in favor of relative safety and reliability.

It is unclear why the decision was made, but there is much <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/mistrust-in-liberias-biometric-voter-registration-system-is-high-survey-claims">distrust</a> of biometric voter registration, as well as of the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202201/facial-recognition-thermometer-procurement-saga-in-liberia-continues">NEC</a>.

Commissioners, having use biometric ID in their voter registration campaign, seemingly with success, will not be using biometrics during the upcoming balloting.

News publication Front Page Africa <a href="https://frontpageafricaonline.com/news/liberia-election-would-be-conducted-using-old-ballot-paper-style-nec-discloses/">says</a> commission chair <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/?posttype=all&amp;s=Davidetta+Browne+Lansanah">Davidetta Browne Lansanah</a> has decided manual ballots will be cast October 10 in the general and presidential elections.

Lansanah reportedly gave the news to candidates this week.

Biometrics in voting is "a technological advancement," she is quoted in Front Page Africa saying, but it "will be done incrementally" in Liberia.

Biometrics reportedly has already done a great service for the nation. The algorithm <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/data-clean-up-underway-after-biometric-voter-registration-exercise-in-liberia">spotted</a> 3,634 voters (out of a <a href="https://www.liberianobserver.com/liberia-cummings-skips-key-electoral-forum-amidst-leadership-concerns">total 2.4 million</a> who registered) who together created 27,000 duplicate registrations.

## Group urges Nigerian govt to review ID requirements for voter verification

		A civil society organization working in the area of democracy and human rights, Yiaga Africa, has called for a legislative amendment in Nigeria which will allow the use of identity credentials such as a national ID card, a passport and a driver’s licence for voter verification at the polling station.

The organization made the call in its <a href="https://yiaga.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Dashed-Hopes-Yiaga-Africa-Report-on-the-2023-General-Election_.pdf">comprehensive report</a> on the 2023 general elections in Nigeria released in the capital Abuja recently.

The only ID currently accepted for voter verification in Nigeria is the Permanent Voter’s Card (PVC), a biometric card issued to citizens after they enroll in the electoral register. There were over 93 million Nigerians on the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202301/nigeria-biometric-voter-register-99-94-solid-with-local-tech-10m-new-sign-ups">voter registry</a> when elections were held earlier this year.

Speaking at the unveiling of the report, the Yiaga Africa Board Chairman Hussaini Abdu said expanding the scope of ID credentials used for voter verification will address some of the challenges currently faced with issuing PVCs.

There have been reports of difficulties in the collection of PVCs in the past, and Yiaga Africa is now calling for their complete scrapping.

The group says it is time for the National Independent Electoral Commission (INEC) to “abolish the use of PVCs and adopt the use of other legally acceptable means of identification for voter verification such as driver’s license, international passport, and national identity card.”

“The right to vote requires additional legal and administrative protection as voter disenfranchisement and suppression intensify in each electoral cycle,” the report notes.

Another proposal contained in the report is for INEC to consider drawing up the voter’s registry from the national identity database run by the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC). This, the entity says, will ensure greater transparency and efficiency in the management of the voter’s roll, and will also cut cost.

While Yiaga Africa appreciates the introduction of new technologies such as the BVAS into the electoral process in Nigeria, it posits that technology is no silver bullet. It insists that for the elections to be truly transparent, INEC must ensure high integrity for any technology deployed.

“The legal framework places no statutory obligation on INEC to subject its electoral technologies to testing and verification. Standard practice requires institutions deploying electoral technologies to test and verify equipment, software and tools within a reasonable time before deployment for election,” the report says.

There were reported hitches with the BVAS during the general elections in February and March.

The report also proposes many other administrative and legislative changes to INEC in order to ensure a more streamlined and credible electoral process in the country.

Meanwhile, as part of efforts to make the electoral process more inclusive, INEC said recently that it is considering setting up voter registration points in camps hosting internally displaced persons (IDPs) as well as in the communities hosting them, Punch <a href="https://punchng.com/inec-seeks-voter-registration-centres-in-idp-camps/">reports</a>.

The INEC Commissioner in charge of Outreach and Partnerships, Kunle Ajayi, made the announcement during a recent training workshop in Abuja, supported by the European Union to increase the participation of forcibly displaced persons in Nigeria’s electoral process.

“As a starting point, we advocate the establishment of accessible and well-organized voter registration centers in the IDP camps and host communities. This will allow the IDPs to easily register as voters and exercise their right to vote without undue burdens,” Ajayi is quoted by Punch as saying.

		Guyana’s government is advancing legislation to back a biometric national digital ID card initiative, which spells out how the system will work.

<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/veridos-gmbh">Veridos</a> was selected as the supplier for the project <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202303/contracts-for-national-biometric-travel-ids-won-by-hid-in-bahrain-veridos-in-guyana">in March</a>, and the <a href="https://guyanatimesgy.com/digital-id-card-with-high-security-features-to-shield-against-fraud/">Guyana Times</a> has revealed the contract is worth $35.4 million.

The Digital Identity Card Bill would establish the basis for a civil registry of identity data for citizens from 14 years of age, along with non-citizens. The registry will be administered by Guyana’s Data Protection Commissioner. The cards will be considered legal proof of identity for public and private sector interactions, both in person and online. They are also intended for travel.

Cards for foreigners would be used in work permit issuance.

The country’s chief medical officer and police commissioner will be responsible for submitting regular record of deaths so the registry can be updated. The Data Protection Commissioner will have the option of setting up one or more fixed-location or mobile centers for data collection and card distribution in each region of Guyana.

The digital ID cards will contain the bearer’s name, date and place of birth, unique identification number, sex and citizenship. It will also include a facial image and fingerprint data for biometric matching, and a signature. The cards will also comply with the relevant ISO/IEC standards, according to the bill.

One of the goals of the project, as stated in the legislation, is the facilitation of electronic governance and enhanced government service delivery.

The bill also sets out penalties for submitting false information and fraudulent use of the ID cards.

		An optical fingerprint module from Beijing-based <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/eyecool-technology-co-ltd">Eyecool Technology</a> has been certified to the standard for biometric image quality set by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigations.

The ECO320 has passed <a href="https://fbibiospecs.fbi.gov/certifications-1/cpl">FBI</a> PIV (Personal Identity Verification) and FAP20 assessments. The module uses Eyecool’s proprietary dynamic fingerprint template fusion technology, which has won a major technology innovation award in China. During the certification test, the ECO320 maintained performance in environments with bright light and on dirty fingers, according to a company announcement. Eyecool says the module also provides clear fingerprint images with fast acquisition speed, accurate recognition performance, and tolerance of dry, wet and rough fingertips, making it appropriate for large-scale fingerprint collection and biometric authentication.

The specifications are used as a reference standard for public procurement in most countries, and often for enterprise contracts, the company notes.

Eyecool’s EC-FPD103 module and ECSM329 scanner have each previously been FBI PIV certified, and the ECO500 FAP60 livescan biometric capture device is certified to the Appendix F specification.

The company also sells an ABIS, and has deployed facial recognition systems for banks, educational institutions, and government agencies. An iris recognition algorithm submitted by Eyecool also sits 15th on the two-eye accuracy leaderboard of the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology’s <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/IREX10/">IREX 10: Identification Track</a> as of press time.

		Passwordless authentication provider <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/hypr">Hypr</a> has launched a new product called Hypr Adapt.

The company says that the product provides adaptive protection for authentication by analyzing risks from numerous sources and adjusting authentication security policies in response. This includes analyzing contextual information from mobile, web and browser signals.

Hypr is betting on the rise of passwordless solutions. In the third-annual <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202303/hypr-passwordless-report-uncovers-pervasive-insecure-authentication-practices">State of Passwordless Security Report</a> published in March, the company found that 97 percent of organizations use passwordless authentication methods that can be phished and are susceptible to push notification attacks. Push notification attacks are on the rise, nearly doubling to 28 percent of organizations since last year’s report.

“With more than 60 percent of organizations reporting an identity-related authentication breach in the last 12 months, securing digital identities is one of the highest priorities for organizations,” says Bojan Simic, CEO and CTO of Hypr.

The company also claims that customers who have been using its passwordless MFA solution, Hypr Authenticate, have realized a return on investment (ROI) of a whopping 324 percent with a $8.1 million total cost benefits realized and a payback period of less than six months. Forrester’s <a href="https://www.forrester.com/policies/tei/">Total Economic Impact</a> consultants performed the independent study.

		Biometric wearables creator <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/token">Token</a> has announced that it has begun production of its multifactor authentication Smart Ring.

The New York-based company said that almost 200 organizations have joined the wait list for the NFC-enabled ring, which is equipped with a fingerprint sensor. Launched in 2017, the smart ring is designed for secure contactless transactions at point-of-sale (POS) terminals. The rings, which will be produced in the US, can also be used for access control and passwordless login thanks to its compliance with FIDO2.

“Starting production is a major milestone for Token, reflecting the hard work and dedication of a very talented team, and marking a critical step toward stopping the cyberattacks that are devastating so many businesses,” says Token CEO, John Gunn. “We are seeing incredible demand from the market, with a significant portion of our first production run already committed.”

Token has secured $43 million in financing, including a <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202304/token-raises-30m-to-fuel-growth-and-development-of-biometric-authentication-wearable">$30 million funding</a> round from Grand Oaks Capital in April of this year. The company says it has won six awards for its wearable.

		<a href="https://duality.health/">Duality Health</a>, a face biometrics patient identification software provider, and Acadian Ambulance, one of America’s largest privately-held medical transportation companies, have recently partnered to transform healthcare using AI-powered facial recognition technologies.

Complexities in syncing patient records across healthcare organizations have raised safety concerns and have resulted in significant financial losses for ambulance services, hospitals, and health systems. In a 2020 <a href="https://www.blackbookmarketresearch.com/blog/improving-the-patient-identification-process-and-interoperability-to-decrease-patient-record-error-rates">Black Book survey</a>, approximately 35 percent of all denied claims stemmed from inaccurate <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/patient-identification">patient identification</a> or information, costing the average provider $2.5 million annually and the U.S. healthcare system over $6.7 billion.

“The increasing amount of healthcare data has led to challenges in identifying and reconciling patient records due to disparate systems and duplication. By utilizing Duality’s facial biometric patient identification software, Acadian seeks to enhance record matching, improve patient care and satisfaction, increase efficiency, and reduce costs,” says Benjamin Swig, director of healthcare innovation and strategy at Acadian Ambulance.

Duality’s software uses face biometrics to create unique identifiers linked to patients’ medical record numbers. This approach ensures over 99.96 percent accurate patient identification, promoting better health data exchange between healthcare organizations, according to the announcement.

“By accurately identifying and matching patients across EMS and hospitals, we seek to minimize treatment delays, improve revenue cycle efficiency, and streamline information sharing,” says Clayton Saliba, CEO and co-founder of Duality Health.

Upon linking the patient’s face biometrics to their medical records, Duality integrates healthcare provider and Health Information Exchange data into an EMS summary screen via HL7 FHIR, an API-focused standard for health information interoperability. Duality’s software is also integrated within the hospital's electronic health record system, leveraging Substitutable Medical Applications and Reusable Technologies (SMART on FHIR) for private and secure access.

“We are excited to partner with Duality Health,” says Acadian Ambulance Chairman and CEO Richard Zuschlag. "Through strategic partnerships, we strive to enhance patient care and optimize cost-efficiency for all involved. We are dedicated to being at the forefront of the next generation of EMS and are excited to continue shaping the future of healthcare."

Acadian provides ambulance services in most of Louisiana, a large area of Texas, and three counties between Tennessee and Mississippi.
