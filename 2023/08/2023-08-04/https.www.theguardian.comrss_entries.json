I\u2019ve been into them for a while, but this summer they suddenly seem to have slipped into the mainstream. They\u2019ve even popped up in a couple of supermarket ranges (as well as in the somewhat less impressive <a href=\"https://www.coop.co.uk/products/banrock-station-wild-lands-white-blend-75cl\">Banrock Station Wild Lands</a> line at the Co-op).</p><p>But what is a field blend, and how does it differ from any other blend? Well, the strict definition is that it denotes a wine made from a vineyard where different varieties of grape are planted randomly, rather than in blocks of a single one. It\u2019s the way things used to be done, and operates much like a wildflower meadow. You can see the romance in that \u2013 though winemakers these days are more likely to know exactly what they\u2019re picking, so the term is also used to cover grapes that are harvested and co-fermented at the same time, which results in some being underripe and others riper, and often brings a lively freshness to the wine (field blends are rarely high in alcohol, either). Blends, by contrast, are made mainly from grapes that are picked and vinified separately, which makes for more uniformity but less of an unpredictable thrill.</p><p>For more by Fiona Beckett, go to <a href=\"https://fionabeckett.substack.com/\">fionabeckett.substack.com</a></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/aug/04/growing-appeal-of-field-blend-wines-fiona-beckett\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/aug/04/growing-appeal-of-field-blend-wines-fiona-beckett", "date_published": "2023-08-04T13:00:13+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Congress has authority to regulate supreme court, says liberal Justice Kagan \u2013 US politics live", "description": "<p>Elena Kagan told judicial conference that supreme court should be subject to checks and balance</p><p>Good morning, US politics blog readers. <strong>Donald Trump</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/03/trump-arraignment-indictment-jan-6-2020-election\">came and went from Washington DC yesterday</a> after pleading not guilty to charges related to trying to overturn the election, but the legacy of his presidency can be found all across the capital, particularly at the supreme court.

An operatically extravagant artsploitation ordeal that devastated saucer-eyed audiences at the Cannes film festival, Breaking the Waves won Von Trier the Grand Prix, though missed out on the Palme d\u2019Or. It also launched him as a world-cinema superstar, though it is surely only the blazingly passionate commitment of his lead Emily Watson that gives this film its substance; she varnishes it with her own luminous talent and commitment. It is perhaps to Watson that Von Trier owes his entire career.</p><p>Breaking the Waves is set in a quaintly imagined remote Scottish community in the pre-cellphone era of the 70s and 80s, many of whose menfolk are away for long periods on an oil rig. It is dominated by a fiercely patriarchal, joyless, puritanical and rather Scandinavian-looking church whose elders are in the habit of condemning wrongdoers to hell in special sinners\u2019 burials. The sheer cruelty of these ceremonies is what continues to sweep this film\u2019s fervent audiences away in horror and compassion, perhaps not quite grasping that these appalling events are a figment of Von Trier\u2019s imagination.
