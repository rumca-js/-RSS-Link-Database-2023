Federal Judge Amit Mehta <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/04/technology/google-search-monopoly-judge.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare\">has ruled</a> that the Department of Justice (DOJ) and key states can't claim that Google is protecting a monopoly by promoting its own products in search results over alternatives. The plaintiffs haven't proved there's an &quot;anticompetitive effect,&quot; according to the decision. Judge Mehta also tossed antitrust allegations regarding Android's compatibility and anti-fragmentation agreements, Google Assistant, internet of things devices and the Android Open Source Project.</p><p>The DOJ can still make its remaining arguments, Judge Mehta says. Notably, officials claim Google is abusing its power through deals that require Android manufacturers to both pre-load Google apps and make Google the default search engine in their mobile browsers. The DOJ and states are concerned this prevents rivals like Bing and DuckDuckGo from gaining significant adoption.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>In a statement to Engadget, Google President of Global Affairs Kent Walker says the company welcomes the judge's &quot;careful consideration&quot; when dismissing the search issues. He maintains that people choose Google only &quot;because it's helpful,&quot; and that the firm would show at trial that its other practices are both competitive and lawful. We've asked the DOJ for comment and will let you know if we hear back.</p><p>The DOJ and partner states filed the lawsuit in 2020. They didn't advocate for specific penalties at the time, but punishments could include fines, business restrictions and splitting divisions into separate companies. At the time, Google defended itself by arguing that it still had to negotiate partnerships and had competitions from services like Twitter (now X) and Expedia.</p><p>This isn't the only antitrust case against Google, including in the US. An alliance of states sued Google in 2020 over <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-antitrust-lawsuit-texas-attorney-general-204043354.html\">allegedly anticompetitive ad pricing</a>. However, the narrowed scope might make the case more difficult, not to mention limit the potential damages.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/federal-judge-narrows-scope-of-antitrust-case-against-google-ahead-of-trial-202837725.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/federal-judge-narrows-scope-of-antitrust-case-against-google-ahead-of-trial-202837725.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-08-04T20:28:37+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Devolver Digital will proudly delay a bunch of games in its next showcase", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/devolver-digital/\"><ins>Devolver Digital</ins></a> has cultivated a name for itself over the years as a publisher with an offbeat approach to marketing games.

The offer is meant to help employees \"transition to the hybrid workplace,\" according to the offer. Workers can theoretically have the benefits of both the office and home while never having to travel far.</p><p>We've asked Google for comment. A spokesperson talking to <em>CNBC</em> says the firm routinely offers employee specials for its facilities.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The catch, as you might guess, is that employees have to pay for the hotel stays themselves. While the roughly $3,000 per month needed to take up the offer isn't out of line with apartment rentals and includes full service, it still amounts to paying to live at work without a substantial discount. Google team members have to either forego a home of their own or effectively pay rent for two places. The hotel offer is also only truly useful for people working at Bay View, which primarily houses ad-related teams. Those who still have to work at the older campus can't benefit.</p><p>The hotel special comes as Google steps up pressure on remote workers it wants to come back. The tech giant started returning some employees to its offices in 2022, when it mandated three days a week for affected people. Some balked at the prospect, though, arguing that in-person work led to high living costs and reduced productivity. Google wasn't deterred, though, and this June started considering office presences in performance reviews.</p><p>The escalating tensions now come with the prospect of regulatory action. YouTube contractors who voted to unionize have accused Google and its contracting firm Cognizant of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/youtube-contractors-union-nlrb-complaint-152056334.html\">abusing return-to-office policies</a> to stifle labor organization, and filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/googles-latest-bid-to-push-hybrid-work-is-a-99-rate-at-its-on-campus-hotel-193058151.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/googles-latest-bid-to-push-hybrid-work-is-a-99-rate-at-its-on-campus-hotel-193058151.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-08-04T19:30:58+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Global ransomware attacks at an all-time high and the US is the primary target", "description": "<p>Global ransomware attacks are on the rise, according to a <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=de672dc6-c8dc-4845-af8c-ebf5e59ce373&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Malwarebytes&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJkZTY3MmRjNi1jOGRjLTQ4NDUtYWY4Yy1lYmY1ZTU5Y2UzNzMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFsd2FyZWJ5dGVzLmNvbS9ibG9nL3RocmVhdC1pbnRlbGxpZ2VuY2UvMjAyMy8wOC9nbG9iYWwtcmFuc29td2FyZS1hdHRhY2tzLWF0LWFuLWFsbC10aW1lLWhpZ2gtc2hvd3MtbGF0ZXN0LTIwMjMtc3RhdGUtb2YtcmFuc29td2FyZS1yZXBvcnQiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUzZmM4MTI4LTg4NjAtNDRkOS1iOTc2LTgxYTVkMmUyZjdkZSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAUj57OCiOSl7G4K65cyWeciMO6oePoko8PdHT9upFlr5&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.malwarebytes.com%2Fblog%2Fthreat-intelligence%2F2023%2F08%2Fglobal-ransomware-attacks-at-an-all-time-high-shows-latest-2023-state-of-ransomware-report\"><ins>report issued by Malwarebytes.</ins></a> The study shows a massive surge from July 2022 to June 2023, with the United States bearing the brunt of these attacks. The organization noted that of the 1,900 reported ransomware attacks collected, over 43 percent originate in the U.S, an increase of 75 percent from last year\u2019s findings.</p><p>Germany, France and the UK also experienced an uptick in deployed ransomware, but at a lower rate than the United States. The report details 48 separate ransomware groups that attacked American companies, governmental organizations and garden variety consumers during the aforementioned time period. Even worse? Healthcare and educational institutions were disproportionately impacted. For instance, dental insurer Managed Care of North America (MCNA) <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ransomware-attack-exposes-sensitive-data-for-nearly-9-million-dental-patients-161546447.html\"><ins>experienced a breach back in March</ins></a> and the New York City Department of Education <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/clop-ransomware-gang-obtained-personal-data-of-45000-new-york-city-students-in-moveit-hack-204655820.html\"><ins>was hit in June.</ins></a></p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>It\u2019s worth noting that the study conducted by Malwarebytes shows only reported incidents, so the actual number of attacks could be much higher than 1,900. The whole point of a ransomware attack is to, well, exact a ransom, so some organizations make the payout and keep things quiet.</p><p>What exactly is a ransomware attack? It\u2019s malware expressly designed to deny users and organizations access to files on a computer. The software locks everything up tight and when you pay the ransom, you receive a decryption key to regain access to the files. It\u2019s a digital shakedown.</p><p>The biggest global offender is a ransomware gang called Clop, long-suspected to <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2023/06/15/politics/us-government-hit-cybeattack/index.html\"><ins>have ties to Russia.</ins></a> The criminal organization has evolved in the past year, capitalizing on zero-day software vulnerabilities to amp up the scope of its attacks. Back in June, the group took advantage of one of these vulnerabilities in enterprise file transfer software to breach the servers of hundreds of companies, including the largest US pension fund.</p><p>Malwarebytes says this transition to zero-day software exploits, instead of phishing emails and virus-laden downloads, could \u201csignal a change in the game\u201d and explain the increase in reported incidents.</p><p>As for the rest of the world, France\u2019s numbers doubled in the past year, with a disproportionate number of attacks levied at governmental institutions. The UK experienced 200 attacks from 32 separate groups with an alarming uptick in frequency. Last year, the country reported a single ransomware attack per month. In this most recent year, it was eight per month.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/global-ransomware-attacks-at-an-all-time-high-and-the-us-is-the-primary-target-191550845.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/global-ransomware-attacks-at-an-all-time-high-and-the-us-is-the-primary-target-191550845.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-08-04T19:15:50+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Motorola Razr (2023) review: A midrange foldable that underwhelms", "description": "<p>While <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/moto-razr-review-finally-some-real-competition-for-samsungs-flip-foldables-203033514.html\">Motorola\u2019s pricier Razr+</a> beat Samsung\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-hands-on-a-larger-external-display-holds-promise-110059050.html\">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a> to the punch with its expansive external display, the Razr (named the Razr 40 in other regions like the UK) was pitched as a more budget-friendly foldable. For now, pricing and availability in the US haven\u2019t been confirmed, but in the UK it\u2019s priced at \u00a3800 (roughly $1,025) while the Razr+ retails at \u00a31,050 in the UK and $999 in the US.</p><p>The new Razr is cheaper, but it\u2019s also more limited. In screen terms, it's comparable with foldable phones from a few years ago. But it has a bigger battery and seemingly better cameras. As the fanfare from <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/summer-samsung-unpacked-2023-everything-announced-at-the-event-134721886.html\">Samsung\u2019s Unpacked reveal</a> dies down (and we get to grips with the Z Flip 5), the Moto Razr begs the question: What do you really get from a cheaper foldable phone?</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h2>Design and displays</h2><p>Let\u2019s start with some Razr family resemblances. Both the Razr and Razr+ have the same body and internal flexible 6.9-inch display, and there is no more Razr \u2018chin\u2019 on either device. No corners have been cut on the foldable screen, with a crisp 413 pixels per inch and up to 1,400 nits of brightness. This is a flagship display. Internally, at least.</p><div id=\"61960ac9411148d9a2412af6fc8b2582\"></div><p>However, the cheaper Razr has a much smaller 1.5-inch external panel, which puts it somewhere between Samsung\u2019s original Z Flip and the Z Flip 3. You know it will feel constrictive when it\u2019s smaller than the first two Samsung flip smartphones. This is all exacerbated by the fact that its own sibling the Razr+ has a 3.6-inch external screen.&nbsp;</p><p>The Razr\u2019s panel takes up about 20 percent of the lower front of the device, with a 64-megapixel and 8MP camera duo to its right. It has an IP52 rating, which is better than nothing, but won\u2019t protect against more than a weak splash or light rain.</p><p>I do like the Razr\u2019s vegan, faux leather texture, so much so that despite my fear of breaking or damaging foldable devices, I risked using the phone without the hard shell case that came in the box. I particularly liked the grey-green sage colorway, too. Like the Razr+, Moto\u2019s middleweight phone folds completely closed, with no gaps when looking at it from the side.</p><figure><img alt=\"Motorola Razr (2023) review\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/235dfb53-313a-11ee-bc7f-cf79069502b3\" style=\"height: 2400px; width: 3600px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Mat Smith / Engadget</div></figure><p>The small external screen is limited to basic phone functions. You can swipe sideways through your calendar, weather forecasts, while a drag up from the clock will show all your notifications. Swiping down gets to quick toggles for things like WiFi and Bluetooth. It\u2019s functional, but a little dated. This is what we got with the very first flip smartphones; I need a little more. Even compared to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-4-review-camera-samples-specs-price-battery-life-170027529.html\">last year\u2019s Z Flip 4</a> \u2014 likely to be discounted to a similar price as this Razr now that its successor is here \u2013 Samsung\u2019s device offers more to do and see on its external screen.</p><p>The Razr\u2019s second screen is most helpful when you\u2019re using exterior cameras for selfies. Double pressing the power button quick-launches the camera app, and you can tap to capture images with a timer, swipe up and down to switch between the ultra-wide and standard lenses and swipe sideways to swap between video, photo and portrait modes. You can even summon a cartoon character to distract children when taking photos, in both unfolded and folded modes.</p><p>The Razr\u2019s 2,640 x 1,080 screen can refresh at up to 144Hz, a little shy of the Razr+'s 160Hz. That said, if you\u2019re coming from smartphones with refresh rates of 90Hz or less, you\u2019re still going to sense the improved smoothness. The panel is bright, responsive \u2014 it\u2019s a smartphone screen. Anyone serving in the Crease Police, yes it\u2019s there, but compared to older foldables, running your finger over it doesn\u2019t feel like it's testing the screen\u2019s durability. Foldable hinges (and the screens covering them) continue to get better but if you\u2019re looking for visible hints of a folding display, they\u2019re still there.</p><h2><strong>Performance and software</strong></h2><p>With a Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 chip, the Razr shows its midrange hand a little. It\u2019s not a flagship processor, but this is not a flagship foldable. I noticed the Razr lagged a little when I was trying to edit a lengthy video file, but it eventually managed to complete the task.</p><p>A pleasant surprise with this Razr was its 4,200mAh battery. This is much larger than the 3,800mAh battery in the Razr+ and the Galaxy Z Flip 4\u2019s 3,700 mAh cell. In our video rundown test, it lasted just beyond 18 hours, a good three hours longer than the Razr+ and better than last year\u2019s Z Flip 4.</p><figure><img alt=\"Razr (2023) review\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/a98744b0-313b-11ee-bffb-339082efdd63\" style=\"height: 1815px; width: 3226px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Mat Smith / Engadget</div></figure><p>The Razr can also fast-charge at 30W with the included adapter included (outside of the US at least). I was able to get the Razr to reach 100 percent in under an hour.  There\u2019s also support for slower 5W wireless charging, but alas, no reverse charging, if you were hoping to top up any wireless earbuds.</p><p>I\u2019ve already noted the limited utility of the Razr\u2019s external display, but software-wise it\u2019s just not good enough. Customization options only extend to different fonts and colorways for the clock. It\u2019s especially jarring given that we know Motorola is capable of more, thanks to the Razr+.</p><h2><strong>Cameras</strong></h2><p>One of the big spec differences between Motorola\u2019s duo of foldables this year are the cameras. While the Razr+ has a pair of 12MP cameras like the Galaxy Z Flip series, the standard Razr has a 13MP wide-angle lens alongside a 64MP primary lens with optical image stabilization. Ah, so this will be where the Razr shines, right? Sadly, no.</p><p>In almost every shot I took, the Razr didn\u2019t reach the standards of the Razr+ or even last year\u2019s Galaxy Flip 4. Motorola's claims of ultra-fast and accurate laser auto-focus don\u2019t really bear out in reality, especially with video. The Razr twitches and struggles to keep consistent focus. I struggled to see many images where the 64MP sensor outperformed the pricier devices, either. I wasn\u2019t getting notably more detail, in fact I was getting less. Turns out, unless you activate high-res capture mode (which is hidden away in the furthest reaches of the camera\u2019s menu), the primary 64MP sensor is aggressively pixel-binned, stripping away detail without improving overall image quality all that much.</p><h2><strong>Wrap-up</strong></h2><figure><img alt=\"Motorola Razr (2023) review\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/2323d880-313a-11ee-9fad-48f50167fc32\" style=\"height: 2400px; width: 3600px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Mat Smith / Engadget</div></figure><p>Are foldables going to be the new smartphone normal? Doubtful. Motorola\u2019s bid for a cheaper (if not <em>that</em> much cheaper) flip phone tries to broaden their appeal, but sadly misses the mark. Its external display simply lacks enough utility in 2023. And I\u2019m not sure who is willing to spend this much money on a phone that's already two years behind the curve.</p><p>However, Motorola has yet to announce pricing or a launch date in the US. If the Razr were to cost $800 or lower, which would be closer to a Galaxy S23 or iPhone 14, it could find an audience. But for most people intrigued by a foldable flip-phone, they would be better served hunting down a discounted Galaxy Z Flip 4.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/motorola-razr-2023-review-a-midrange-foldable-that-underwhelms-190025514.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/motorola-razr-2023-review-a-midrange-foldable-that-underwhelms-190025514.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-08-04T19:00:25+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Coinbase wants its SEC lawsuit dismissed, arguing it doesn't deal in securities", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/coinbase/\"><ins>Coinbase</ins></a> has filed a <a href=\"https://assets.ctfassets.net/c5bd0wqjc7v0/7eaTxSOvCLrGR2frvCqS3Q/b98f952657b7bc821b218d1f601b9161/CoinbasevSEC12_c_Motion.pdf\"><ins>motion to dismiss</ins></a> a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit in which the agency accused the company of illegally running an unregistered national securities exchange, broker and clearing agency.

But even the most convincing optical and auditory illusions can\u2019t fully fool our inner ears.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to feel these big sensations, you\u2019ve got to have the infrastructure first,\u201d University of Chicago PhD student, <a href=\"https://romainnith.com/\">Romain Nith</a>, told Engadget. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to go to theme parks, ride roller coasters, or you need <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/science/samsungs-vr-bungee-jump-is-like-most-vr-more-effective-than-youd-think/\">bungie cords pulling you from the ceiling</a>.\u201d And while the sensations are really like what they\u2019re simulating (because you're really being thrown around), \u201cyou can't have that in your living room.\u201d</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The <a href=\"https://lab.plopes.org/published/2023-CHI-JumpMod.pdf\">JumpMod Haptic Backpack</a> prototype, on the other hand, can effectively fool its user\u2019s sense of proprioception to make jumping in VR feel much more lifelike with a device the size of, well, a backpack. It has been developed by Nith and his research team from the <a href=\"http://lab.plopes.org/\">University of Chicago\u2019s Human-Computer Integration Lab</a>, which is headed by <a href=\"http://plopes.org/\">Pedro Lopes</a>, Associate Professor, Department of Computer Science. The HCI Lab\u2019s research focuses on using technology to \u201cborrow parts of the body for input and output, rather than adding more technology to the body\u201d and, as such, has generated a veritable menagerie of novel devices exploring that concept.</p><p>\u201cI think the next generation of devices is not going to be defined by how small they are, or how implanted they are in the body\u2026 but more about how deeply they integrate with your body,\u201d Lopes told Engadget. He points to the functional issues of dealing with Google Maps in 2007 \u2014 specifically the need to physically print them out for them to be useful. \u201cNow when that runs on your smartphone, the device that can move with you, in your pocket, you can access information anywhere, anytime,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of a sudden that makes a lot of sense. So every jump of these paradigms allows you to do something new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe're looking at the body and trying to create technology that really hybridizes with you,\u201d Lopes continued, using smartwatches as an example, which rely on small spinning motors to create the notification vibration. \u201cThat is one of the reasons smart watches are so big.\u201d</p><p>Instead, a small electrical charge can elicit the same tingling sensation without the need for a \u201cbig rotating mass type of device,\u201d Lopes explained. \u201cThe sensations, the functionality, ends up being the same and the device looks very different.\u201d</p><p>JumpMod takes a similar approach, rapidly shifting the position of a weight worn by the user to fool their senses rather than hoist the user wholesale to practically recreate the sensation. The untethered device is designed to modify the user\u2019s sense of jumping, when used with a VR program, by rapidly lifting and lowering a 2-kilogram weight (which doubles as the device\u2019s power cell) in time with their physical movement. Adjusting the speed of weight\u2019s motion impacted the user\u2019s perceived jump momentum, enabling the team to create sensations of higher and broader jumps, softer and harder landings and being pulled up or down.</p><div id=\"8460f77b17ba48898902986c7059009f\"></div><p>The device itself is completely untethered and can operate both indoors and out. In the demo above, the researcher team used the backpack to improve its user\u2019s timing when jumping rope and even took JumpMod to a basketball court to show how it could be used to help (or hinder) players in a game of one-on-one. The current iteration is built to generate as much force as comfortably possible, in order to maximize the generated sensation, so it does tend to be rather loud and heavy.</p><p>\u201cWe probably don't have to drive it as fast, which generates less noise, and probably don't even need all the weight that we have, which would make for a slimmer backpack,\u201d Lopes said. \u201cWhere does that sensation start to occur? Is that at 100 grams, is it at 300 grams? We optimized it for maximum power, rather than for a minimal device. That's the kind of stuff one would do if one were to commercialize [the technology].\u201d</p><p>Technically, the device doesn\u2019t even need to be worn, it could theoretically be implanted into the backs of theater seats. \u201cI think that the tension here in VR is really interesting,\u201d Lopes said. \u201c If you go to the Disney theme park, <a href=\"https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2022/04/meta-quest-virtual-reality-experience-featuring-ilmxlabs-star-wars-tales-from-the-galaxys-edge-coming-to-disney-springs/\">they play these super-immersive VR scenes</a>, you're on a motion platform and when the scene jumps, the motion platform goes up.\u201d Lope argues that a similar sensation could potentially be produced at a fraction of the infrastructure requirements using JumpMod.</p><p>\u201cThere's lots of proto-motion platforms for VR, some with special shoes, some move around, some rotate but none of them have really paid off,\u201d Lopes said. \u201cIt's a really difficult challenge where, if you want to create an involuntary force and involuntary movement, you need a big infrastructure. We are interested in whether that's possible, but honestly, we don't even know if it is.\u201c</p><p>The \u201cinvoluntary\u201d aspect of these devices and technologies is an ethical sticking point for the field, and one which Lopes\u2019 lab <a href=\"https://scholar.google.de/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=dhPGPoIAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=dhPGPoIAAAAJ:1qzjygNMrQYC\">has studied frequently</a>. His students have developed passive systems that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljytGz4nnho\">allow one user to dictate the hand motions of another</a>, or use electrical muscle stimulation to improve the users\u2019 dexterity \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BT8REEJibM\">artificially boosting their reaction speeds</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOOlHZ8hBnA\">shaping their finger positions on a guitar fretboard</a>. They can even be controlled through an exoskeleton to <a href=\"https://news.uchicago.edu/story/new-wearable-device-controls-individual-fingers-sign-language-music\">properly form the words of American Sign Language</a>. However, all of those devices require the user to relinquish some degree of control over their bodies to let the machines do their things.</p><p>\u201cWe call it \u2018optimizing agency,\u2019\u201d Lopes said. For most of the projects in his lab, \u201cagency is not super critical.\u201d Stakes are low when allowing a robot to guide your finger positionings when learning to play guitar or have one physically guide your head using electrical muscle stimulation during a workplace safety training experience. \u201cWe apply the [EMS pads] to the neck muscles,\u201d Lopes reassured Engadget, which gently buzz the user to make them look around their office space, \u201cso they know where the fire extinguisher is, where the fire exit is.\u201d</p><p>Lopes does concede that physically instigating a user to turn their head by externally stimulating their nervous system could be construed as \u201cmaking people completely lose their sense of agency,\u201d however he notes that his lab consistently includes user overrides for all EMS-related devices. \u201cIn all these, we design some form [of override] to keep you in control. For example, in the case of [the head actuation study], if you push against the device, it senses that you're pushing against the direction that it\u2019s starting to move your head and turns off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think there's more research to be done there, more complex ways to tackle this,\u201d he continued. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/first-brain-computer-interface-implant-in-us-163756888.html\">Brain Computer Interfaces</a> (<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/neuralink-receives-fda-clearance-to-begin-human-trials-of-its-brain-computer-interface-001504243.html\">BCIs</a>)  are really interesting because you can kind of  detect what people are thinking, what their goal is, and then you don't even have to activate the system if it's not needed.\u201d</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-jumpmod-haptic-backpack-makes-virtual-leaps-more-realistic-160003718.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/the-jumpmod-haptic-backpack-makes-virtual-leaps-more-realistic-160003718.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-08-04T16:00:03+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Call of Duty is publicly shaming cheaters in the kill feed", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/call-of-duty/\"><ins>Call of Duty</ins></a> cheaters are now <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-will-now-notify-players-of-cheaters-in-real-time\">being named and shamed</a> in real-time when they're kicked out of a game.

Apple normally sells this 8GB RAM/256GB SSD configuration for $1,099, though we've often seen it go for $50 less elsewhere. Regardless, this is the top pick in our guide to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-laptops-120008636.html\">the best laptops</a>, and it earned a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/macbook-air-m2-review-2022-130040098.html\">review score of 96</a> last year. It continues to offer almost everything we look for in a mainstream notebook: a thin design, a bright and accurate display, long battery life, a comfortable keyboard, useful speakers and dependable performance for most day-to-day tasks. The storage in this config is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23220299/apple-macbook-air-m2-slow-ssd-read-write-speeds-testing-benchmark\">technically slower</a> than higher-capacity models, but that shouldn't be a major hindrance unless you plan on doing more intense tasks like media editing.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The older <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDhONUxOUUNYLz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby0xczYtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImQ3YzZmNTExLTlmZDYtNDM0ZS1iNTBmLTRlNDU0OTdiY2FhMyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXEgUHb7JJA6dK3jpm6G004zwiHM76_Vlqt_Ero4eFNJ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08N5LNQCX%2F\">M1-based MacBook Air</a> is still available for an all-time low of $750 if you want to pay as little as possible for a competent MacBook, though you'll have to deal with a more dated design and a mediocre 720p webcam. There's an important caveat to both of these deals, too: According to a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-07-16/apple-creates-new-vision-products-group-vpg-for-future-mixed-reality-headsets-lk5g2ee4?sref=10lNAhZ9\">recent <em>Bloomberg </em>report</a>, Apple could launch an updated 13-inch MacBook Air with a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apples-first-m3-macs-could-arrive-in-october-163204526.html\">new M3 chip</a> as soon as this October. The current models are still strong values if you need a notebook right now, but if you can afford to wait for the latest and greatest, you may want to hold off.</p><h2>Anker 622 Magnetic Battery</h2><p></p><p>The <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDk5MjVTM1I5Lz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby0xczYtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImQ3YzZmNTExLTlmZDYtNDM0ZS1iNTBmLTRlNDU0OTdiY2FhMyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAARq_B42ZvEN8bxogxaeUkoTsYF3KXIB_6RC3QudzT0Oy&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09925S3R9%2F\">Anker 622 Magnetic Battery</a> is a pocket-friendly wireless power bank that <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/anker-622-magsafe-battery-pack-irl-143059141.html\">we've recommended</a> in the past. Right now it's down to $40, which isn't quite an all-time low but is still $20 off its typical going rate.&nbsp;</p><p>This 5,000mAh (19.25Wh) battery can't fully refill most iPhones from nothing, and it only charges at 7.5W, so like many wireless models, it won't be as fast as using a cable. It can also get hot. Still, its slim frame snaps easily onto the back of any MagSafe-compatible iPhone, and it can deliver around an 80 percent charge to a standard iPhone 14. It also has a built-in kickstand, so it can prop your phone up when you're not using it. If you really want the convenience of a fully wireless charger, it's a fine value.&nbsp;</p><p>Note that Anker sells an <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMEI0NjZZVFQzP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTFzNi0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDdjNmY1MTEtOWZkNi00MzRlLWI1MGYtNGU0NTQ5N2JjYWEzIn0&amp;signature=AQAAATJps5e7g4RQ_gFWnq_MB68lmHABUzN4uJLas3A4k_Dt&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0B466YTT3\">\"upgraded\" version</a> of the 622 with a USB-C port on the side instead of the bottom, though that's a bit more expensive as of this writing.

That matches the best price we've seen for the 4K streaming stick and comes in about $20 off its average street price. While <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-streaming-devices-media-players-123021395.html\">we generally prefer</a> Roku and Google's streaming platforms over Amazon's Fire OS, the 4K Max is still a suitable option for casual streaming. It supports just about all the major apps and HDR standards, it has Alexa voice controls built into its remote and it's fairly quick to load menus.&nbsp;</p><p>You'll get the most out of any Fire TV device if you already use Amazon services like Prime Video or Alexa, as Fire OS tends to prioritize the company's own offerings throughout the UI. You'll have to deal with ads as well, and there's no support for Apple AirPlay or Google Cast. For $25, though, those issues might be easier to look past.</p><h2>Google Chromecast with Google TV (HD)</h2><p></p><p>If you're looking to add streaming functionality to an older 1080p or 720p display, note that the 1080p version of the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9DaHJvbWVjYXN0LUdvb2dsZS1UVi1TdHJlYW1pbmctRW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9kcC9CMEI5SFM2RExaP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTFzNi0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDdjNmY1MTEtOWZkNi00MzRlLWI1MGYtNGU0NTQ5N2JjYWEzIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAWG9PDwh9BTBKVLSydOM3LAULFEXEvThG-8yoa4IuxYE&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FChromecast-Google-TV-Streaming-Entertainment%2Fdp%2FB0B9HS6DLZ\">Google Chromecast with Google TV</a> is on sale for $20 at various retailers.

Otherwise, it provides the same extensive app support, impressive search and intuitive interface. Like the 4K model, you'd get this if you want a streamer that's more proactive about recommending shows and movies you might like based on your viewing history.

Still, if you just want a cheap slate for browsing the web, using Alexa and consuming Amazon e-books and media, there isn't much better for less than $100.</p><h2>SK Hynix Gold P31</h2><p></p><p>If you want to speed up the storage performance of an older desktop or laptop, the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDhES0I1TFdZP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTFzNi0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDdjNmY1MTEtOWZkNi00MzRlLWI1MGYtNGU0NTQ5N2JjYWEzIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAWDtjfSNFIa0EnVbR_EZ8XVIl-eCODeoxiFWk9aleXFL&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08DKB5LWY\">SK Hynix Gold P31</a> is a well-regarded internal SSD that's received <a href=\"https://www.anandtech.com/show/16012/the-sk-hynix-gold-p31-ssd-review\">high</a><a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/sk-hynix-gold-p31-m2-nvme-ssd-review\">marks</a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-ssds/\">elsewhere</a> for its power efficiency.

Its curved QD-OLED panel has a 32:9 aspect ratio, 240Hz refresh rate, 5,120 x 1,440 resolution and dual built-in speakers alongside the usual color, contrast and response time benefits. We haven't tested the device ourselves, but <a href=\"https://reviewed.usatoday.com/gaming/content/samsung-odyssey-oled-g9-review-hugely-impressive\">other</a><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/computing/monitors/samsung-odyssey-oled-g9-review-a-futuristic-monitor-with-a-backwards-ui\">reviews</a><a href=\"https://www.displayninja.com/samsung-odyssey-oled-g9-review/\">around</a><a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/samsung-odyssey-oled-g9\">the web</a><a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/samsung-odyssey-oled-g9/\">have</a> been glowing.&nbsp;</p><p>The downside is that it costs $2,200. That's a lot! Right now, though, the device is $400 off. Clearly, that's lightyears from cheap, and even at that price, the panel won't get as bright as the best non-OLED options. But if money is no object, this looks to be as high-end as ultrawide monitors currently get, and now it's a smidge less expensive.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter and </em><a href=\"https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src\"><em>subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em> for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apples-macbook-air-m2-drops-to-an-all-time-low-plus-the-rest-of-the-weeks-best-tech-deals-154028563.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/apples-macbook-air-m2-drops-to-an-all-time-low-plus-the-rest-of-the-weeks-best-tech-deals-154028563.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-08-04T15:40:28+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The next Pok\u00e9mon Presents event takes place August 8th", "description": "<p>There hasn't been a big Pok\u00e9mon news update <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/a-pokemon-direct-event-will-take-place-on-february-27th-153032910.html\">since February</a>, but don't worry \u2014 you're about to get up to speed.

Currently, doctors and medical staff who work in treatment rooms that specialize in treating relevant heart procedures often <a href=\"https://pdf.sciencedirectassets.com/781090/1-s2.0-S2772930323X00052/1-s2.0-S2772930323005318/main.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEIb%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJHMEUCIHiy4EcMJSMDfam4qpccciIubvzC5gIZNmQNnyDpNL6zAiEAkcfDkwIKqKNbda8L0DJH%2FqG3hDjwoUjpk7JeyHGUnhYqswUILxAFGgwwNTkwMDM1NDY4NjUiDNOU%2BVJ6fRZGLsdLrCqQBR5ZA%2Fbn%2BIUDPrmikxkj3%2Fcd5ZjfmGsP7isZ0LmWgpGy0UCT728P2fUbPXQqWJ56Ik%2BXK0%2BHXWbLb94jQrbqpkTVSvF8mBKwCQewg37GBbNC8Kj%2BAQnuP62OFdsTsd583HuMqJpOMnT4C3jH7O7%2FstN6tA71mqNslv7XMik9KeR%2BJkp0cYQGikMMngRgg4FqV3QkPLj7PGo9Ifjvh8VkEWT6JJaeRIHtTDbpOZDa37npUp5Sa253oDBzSk9zfsaIFx1QuKnzNKNgl8ZBVVX47aSvXE6ykI44o06g9Yc44KSI1p9ut9bKzRbNtVmmOPjlpYDUOqaxwgT%2Fwt4SYV6LEwxxmJlrim%2BWoICCu2EzhmarCmzTzO4nfH5mmVlSWE5zC7tko5oXhYshQgbb7cnkYbp3aZn7Ob1aIRng80KvbgFLXbSC03no0FQNTQvo2J7ySN9DGR6XJ3pGgbS8dxQqMmhYJOETaSPifGJ2mjbDZ%2B%2FT1iSMXxMe3J%2BjZQAk0zgvhe6aAIeYBGYk5oO9PmnRrGAaReJZJABTNe6Yg5KHUB7%2BWz%2BQCJubH4wEoeWv2MLaFnXDGWJLhjCb4P1hVvWyNF5dUKdJ%2Fo%2FNuwnO0Hoi1a4XTpBO%2B7faSkYVtIJCcaxnLWyubiPILseNRMbRETEDkD28tcBkY1qNzu6%2BoLZQnAKyVy%2B1cc%2Be%2FxRKM9NEitQnOrvVeJ%2BuptIZATk0%2FM4qRLY09jlCojawWztI%2Be5BQjljlSMNNn9uqCcT5Va%2BTNGWjv1z7iEplKX6Yg7sb%2F0yRNFPLAiP1bSvyUbyFcbQ4e2EaN%2Bmw5XuxX7m6ZBHhW0ejvPxhhyWPkS3UeFLvGLbmUEufyM%2Fc4o00sWhPKfNshlaMKGJtKYGOrEBNB0WR4P0SYLmKSGPKZ7s1VL%2FOEyyJMlO78k3x%2Fyg0yHi2%2FESNPxq5tJVr2TdClVc2blfeQQaAx8VpknZqGDqFDoKMswHICuSZl366YoPScrlzGkFxI6DucCxOjTmMiV2S2HJVpJ9dKIz%2FMfZHK0Z6PI1D3uqKxxyUiLGHsBpIc%2B%2FPpon148LCvgCNZptkSEjdy0oCls1KRiWWLgUaqvj1cn5pZKFlw7pQj3ai%2BdUd2q7&amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Date=20230804T144044Z&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Expires=300&amp;X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQ3PHCVTY4IVGBJ5M%2F20230804%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Signature=77ff6e0c8efadfdba89c200ca286ee187007f330d505e50b58e9cbde641de98a&amp;hash=ea27866b0b8c91145d8a73a1b1309d63d7668a2290b7bd8addc1505eb7df11f6&amp;host=68042c943591013ac2b2430a89b270f6af2c76d8dfd086a07176afe7c76c2c61&amp;pii=S2772930323005318&amp;tid=spdf-9fae0e27-f30f-4e1c-9a51-dff8e19cdb4b&amp;sid=89948b2d9ba26046ee398e713b63c799d837gxrqa&amp;type=client&amp;tsoh=d3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29t&amp;ua=0f12550653545f000257&amp;rr=7f178ea808ca8e02&amp;cc=us\">get too much exposure to radiation over time</a>, which can lead to problems like eye issues, cancer, and bone injuries.

But at what cost? Cutting the cord can mean you don\u2019t get to watch local channels, live sports or certain \u201ccable only\u201d networks. If you want to get back some of what cable has to offer \u2013 without signing a contract \u2013 a live TV streaming service may be what you need. We tested out six of the most popular offerings, comparing the features, prices and usability of each to come up with the best live TV streaming service for different types of TV lovers.</p><h2>What to look for in a live TV streaming service</h2><h3><strong>How to stream live TV</strong></h3><p>Streaming live TV is a lot like using Netflix. You get access through apps on your phone, tablet, smart TV, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-streaming-devices-media-players-123021395.html\">streaming device</a>, or a gaming system like an xBox or Playstation and the signal arrives over the internet. A faster and more stable internet connection tends to give you a better experience. Most live TV apps require you to sign up and pay via a web browser. After that, you can activate the app on your device.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h3><strong>Price</strong></h3><p>When I started my research, I was struck by the price difference between live TV and a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-video-streaming-services-133000093.html\">standard streaming app</a> like Netflix or Peacock. Where the latter cost between $5 and $20 per month, many live TV services hit around the $70 mark and can go higher than $100 with additional perks, channel packages and premium extras. I also learned that when it comes to base plans, higher price tags are mostly due to the cost of providing multiple networks \u2013 particularly sports and local stations.</p><h3><strong>Local channels</strong></h3><p>Only two of the services we tried don\u2019t include full local channel coverage and one of those makes no effort at carrying sports. That would be Philo and, as you might guess, it\u2019s the cheapest. The next most affordable option, Sling, only carries three local stations, and only in larger markets, but it still manages to include some of the top sports channels.</p><p>When you sign up with any provider that handles local TV, you\u2019ll enter your zip code, ensuring you get your area\u2019s broadcast affiliates for ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC. Of course, you can also get those stations for free. Nearly all modern television sets support a radio frequency (RF) connection, also known as the coaxial port, which means if you buy an <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9UVi1BbnRlbm5hLUluZG9vci1Cb29zdGVyLVNpZ25hbC9kcC9CMEJGOU04RFZIP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXAyLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1MGViMzRkYi1jMGZjLTRiZmItYWI0MS0xY2JlOTdmYWZmZDgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdNjSFySHUB5LvTxXF-PeO0y_Q2BikkE25wwz5DoNvP8&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FTV-Antenna-Indoor-Booster-Signal%2Fdp%2FB0BF9M8DVH\">HD antenna</a>, you\u2019ll receive locally broadcast stations like ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC. And since the signal is digital, reception is much improved over the staticky rabbit-ears era.</p><h3><strong>Sports</strong></h3><p>One reality that spun my head was the sheer number and iterations of sports networks in existence. Trying to figure out which network will carry the match-up you want to see can be tricky. Google makes it a little easier for sports fans by listing out <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=0931b986-736e-47bb-80b9-5f6f8f4ef5ae&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Google&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIwOTMxYjk4Ni03MzZlLTQ3YmItODBiOS01ZjZmOGY0ZWY1YWUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS9zZWFyY2g_cT11cGNvbWluZytuYmErZ2FtZXMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUwZWIzNGRiLWMwZmMtNGJmYi1hYjQxLTFjYmU5N2ZhZmZkOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAesTVaWGoJAGC8HeWPR-hONFNNDQi_RYK1Xsn7p9P7eQ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dupcoming%2Bnba%2Bgames\">upcoming games</a>: if you click on one, the \u201cTV &amp; streaming\u201d button will tell you which network is covering the event.</p><p>That just leaves figuring out if your chosen service carries that regional sports network. Unfortunately, even with add-ons and extra packages, some providers simply don\u2019t have certain channel lineups. It would take a lawyer to understand the ins and outs of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/south-park-warner-bros-discovery-paramount-lawsuit-211615299.html\">streaming rights negotiations</a>, and networks leave and return to live TV carriers all the time. That said, most major sporting events in the US are covered by ESPN, Fox Sports, TNT, USA and local affiliates.</p><figure><img alt=\"A TV displaying the logos for Philo, Sling, Hulu, DirecTV stream, fuboTV, and YouTube TV apps. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/3cbec0e0-c42d-11ed-bfbe-961d0e86297a\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Amy Skorheim / Engadget</div></figure><h3><strong>Traditional cable networks</strong></h3><p>Dozens of networks were once only available with cable TV, like Bravo, BET, Food Network, HGTV, CNN, Lifetime, SYFY and MTV. If you only subscribe to, say, Max and Netflix, you won\u2019t have access to any of those. All the options we tested deliver sizable lists of cable networks, though only DirecTV gives you all of the top 36 channels ranked <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/126-cable-channels-ranked-2022-183059118.html\">by Nielsen</a> as the most watched in 2022.</p><p>Media conglomerates continue to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/warnermedia-discovery-merger-hbo-max-discovery-plus-214335645.html\">merge</a>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/epix-relaunch-mgm-plus-140538789.html\">rebrand</a> or reenter the streaming market, which means you can find many cable networks on traditional video streaming services like Peacock. Other channels like AMC+ have their own stand-alone apps. If you\u2019re just interested in live TV for cable-only shows, there are cheaper alternatives. I was particularly delighted by the 20 ad-free channels you get on the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=e3296106-c693-4525-ba0e-6b65767ea99e&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Discovery%2B&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJlMzI5NjEwNi1jNjkzLTQ1MjUtYmEwZS02YjY1NzY3ZWE5OWUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGlzY292ZXJ5cGx1cy5jb20vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1MGViMzRkYi1jMGZjLTRiZmItYWI0MS0xY2JlOTdmYWZmZDgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAATxGz2ytnj6015YElXRvBTyedZd22GCfa43yqWiVYBRl&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.discoveryplus.com%2F\">Discovery+</a> app for $7 per month. In addition to original content, Paramount+ has shows from multiple brands like MTV and Comedy Central, while Peacock has Bravo and Hallmark shows.</p><p>There\u2019s even a service called <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3RyeS5mcm5kbHl0di5jb20vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1MGViMzRkYi1jMGZjLTRiZmItYWI0MS0xY2JlOTdmYWZmZDgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVsZIkFL_NAsojioaxhFb7VBEX8KUhX8w_0zsJABNpm3&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Ftry.frndlytv.com%2F\">Frndly TV</a> that costs a mere $7 per month and streams A&amp;E, Lifetime, Game Show Network, Vice and about 35 others. We didn\u2019t test it for this guide because it doesn\u2019t give you local access, news or sports and most people would be better served by the broader coverage on a cheap option like Philo.</p><p>I should also mention free ad-supported TV (<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/youtube-is-testing-a-hub-of-free-cable-style-channels-192518784.html\">FAST</a>) streamers like <a href=\"https://www.plex.tv/\">Plex</a>, <a href=\"https://tubitv.com/\">Tubi</a>, <a href=\"https://pluto.tv/welcome\">PlutoTV</a> and <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=34c77505-6db4-4664-9320-2c38b4122d5e&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sling+TV&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNGM3NzUwNS02ZGI0LTQ2NjQtOTMyMC0yYzM4YjQxMjJkNWUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2xpbmcuY29tL2ZyZWVzdHJlYW0iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUwZWIzNGRiLWMwZmMtNGJmYi1hYjQxLTFjYmU5N2ZhZmZkOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAcyvv1f4WLcVCmGT-rEGdv_2DOP0m5Yn54fVrXNGM8D4&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sling.com%2Ffreestream\">Sling Freestream</a> that let you drop in and watch a decent selection of live networks at zero cost.

You\u2019ll either get unlimited storage for recordings that expires after nine months or a year, or you\u2019ll get a set number of hours (between 50 and 1,000) that you can keep indefinitely. Typically, all you need to do is designate what you want to record and the DVR component will do all the hard work of saving subsequent episodes for you to watch later.</p><p>Aside from being able to watch whenever it\u2019s most convenient, you can also fast-forward through commercials in recorded content. In contrast, you can\u2019t skip them on live TV or video-on-demand (VOD).</p><p>Most live TV subscriptions include access to a selection of VOD content including movies and shows that are currently airing on your subscribed networks. This typically doesn\u2019t cover live events, local shows and news programming. But it does let you watch specific episodes of ongoing shows like <em>Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives</em> or BET\u2019s <em>Sistas</em>. Just search the on-demand library for the program, pick an episode and hit play.</p><h3><strong>Tiers, packages and add-ons</strong></h3><p>Comparing price-to-offering ratios is a task for a spreadsheet. I\u2026 made three. The base plans range from $25 to $75 per month. From there, you can add on packages, which are usually groups of live TV channels bundled by themes like news, sports, entertainment or international. Those cost an extra $5 to $20 per month and simply show up in the guide where you find the rest of your base-level live TV.</p><p>Then there are more premium VOD add-ons, such as Max, AMC+, Starz or Showtime. You may already have these through standalone apps. If you don\u2019t, or if you prefer a combined bill and one access point for your streaming, many live TV subscriptions let you add them.</p><h2>How we tested</h2><p>When I begin testing for a guide, I research the most popular and well-reviewed players in the category and narrow down which are worth trying. For this space, just six services dominate, so I tried them all. After getting them set up using my laptop, I downloaded the apps on a Samsung smart TV running the latest version of Tizen OS. I counted the local stations and regional sports coverage, and noted how many of last year's <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/126-cable-channels-ranked-2022-183059118.html\">top cable networks</a> were available. I then weighed the prices, base packages and available add-ons.</p><p>I then looked at how the programming was organized in each app\u2019s UI and judged how easy everything was to navigate, from the top navigation to the settings. To test the search function, I searched for the same few TV shows on BET, Food Network, HGTV and Comedy Central, since all six providers carry those channels. I noted how helpful the searches were and how quickly they got me to season 6, episode 13 of <em>Home Town</em>.</p><p>I used DVR to record entire series and single movies and watched VOD shows, making sure to test the pause and scan functions. On each service with sports, I searched for the same four upcoming NHL, NBA, MLS and NCAA basketball matches and used the record option to save the games and play them back a day or two later. Finally, I noted any extra perks or irritating quirks.</p><p>Here\u2019s the full list of everything we tried:</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=b250d7a0-0e4e-4332-bc87-bf6e669b0564&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Philo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJiMjUwZDdhMC0wZTRlLTQzMzItYmM4Ny1iZjZlNjY5YjA1NjQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGhpbG8uY29tL2xvZ2luL3N1YnNjcmliZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTBlYjM0ZGItYzBmYy00YmZiLWFiNDEtMWNiZTk3ZmFmZmQ4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAabIVZR19dFPFnrkXwC-HZhqdthhzjQEXtk-uUzjcKrv&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.philo.com%2Flogin%2Fsubscribe\">Philo</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=34c77505-6db4-4664-9320-2c38b4122d5e&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sling+TV&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNGM3NzUwNS02ZGI0LTQ2NjQtOTMyMC0yYzM4YjQxMjJkNWUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2xpbmcuY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTBlYjM0ZGItYzBmYy00YmZiLWFiNDEtMWNiZTk3ZmFmZmQ4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAQuX1x-8Li1Y3BleLw5tlSNrUlv0th9PPvhRuDrLsSQD&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sling.com%2F\">Sling</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/\">YouTube TV</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ca19dea0-e7ad-4f54-beed-6302bce56589&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Hulu&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjYTE5ZGVhMC1lN2FkLTRmNTQtYmVlZC02MzAyYmNlNTY1ODkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaHVsdS5jb20vbGl2ZS10diIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTBlYjM0ZGItYzBmYy00YmZiLWFiNDEtMWNiZTk3ZmFmZmQ4In0&amp;signature=AQAAASOsz4gSX7PSfobz14RykoXuU9OPnxuKEPPXAKT0mdHs&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hulu.com%2Flive-tv\">Hulu + Live TV</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=fd7207b2-1b6a-4385-aa15-2f04784de078&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=DIRECTV&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmZDcyMDdiMi0xYjZhLTQzODUtYWExNS0yZjA0Nzg0ZGUwNzgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGlyZWN0di5jb20vc3RyZWFtLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTBlYjM0ZGItYzBmYy00YmZiLWFiNDEtMWNiZTk3ZmFmZmQ4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAZCwHkjcdTHbgJbx0h8bZZ50xk2YCKyUPzrRoo-1iCLq&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.directv.com%2Fstream%2F\">DirecTV Stream</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9a941868-c063-4b44-9207-896f1fb5891e&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=FuboTV&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5YTk0MTg2OC1jMDYzLTRiNDQtOTIwNy04OTZmMWZiNTg5MWUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cDovL3d3dy5mdWJvLnR2L3dlbGNvbWU_aXJhZD0zNDM3NDcmaXJtcD0yNTM2MjE3JnBhcnRuZXJwcm9wZXJ0eWlkPTMxNDI4MjMmc3ViSWQzPXhpZDpmcjE2NzQyNTQ5ODIwMDhiaGIiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUwZWIzNGRiLWMwZmMtNGJmYi1hYjQxLTFjYmU5N2ZhZmZkOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAbfV5QVpXnp6Zv4vvSRE-0I6_ukuICBOH21I_DjeUyw3&amp;gcReferrer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fubo.tv%2Fwelcome%3Firad%3D343747%26irmp%3D2536217%26partnerpropertyid%3D3142823%26subId3%3Dxid%3Afr1674254982008bhb\">FuboTV</a></p></li></ul><h2>Most well-rounded: YouTube TV</h2><p></p><p>Google\u2019s option makes a strong case for delivering the best streaming service for live TV. Compared to our top pick for sports, <a href=\"https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/\">YouTube TV</a> covers major and minor teams, regional games and national matchups almost as well. It gives you clear navigation, a great search function, unlimited DVR and broad network coverage. It's not quite as affordable as it once was, as YouTube recently <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/youtube-tv-raises-prices-to-an-outrageous-73-per-month-182517379.html\">raised the price</a> to $73 per month \u2013 and it's even more financially precarious if you're not great at resisting temptation.</p><p>Upon signup, you\u2019re presented with nearly 50 different add-ons, including 4K resolution, premium channels and themed packages. Even if you fight the urge to roll Max, Shudder and AcornTV into the mix at signup, the enticement remains as it\u2019s dangerously easy to add more to your subscription. If you search for a program on a network you don\u2019t have, you\u2019re prompted to add it. And of course, you can also rent or buy movies that aren\u2019t currently showing on any channels, just like you can via YouTube. While it\u2019s convenient to be able to order up anything you might want on a whim, I imagine this pushes many users\u2019 bills far above Google\u2019s listed $73 per month.</p><p>Still, it\u2019s nice to have all your entertainment in one place. And if you <em>only</em> want the add-ons, you can actually subscribe to most of the standalone networks without paying for the base plan. Either way, you get a familiar user experience, with navigation you\u2019ll recognize if you\u2019ve spent any time on regular ol\u2019 YouTube. Unsurprisingly, Google\u2019s search function was the best of the bunch, finding the shows and games I searched for quickly and giving me clear choices for how to watch and record.</p><p>At signup, you\u2019ll also pick the shows, networks and teams you like, which are added to your library. YouTube TV then automatically records them. You get unlimited cloud DVR space (though recordings expire after nine months) and it\u2019s dead simple to add programming to your library. Like a real cable experience, YouTube TV autoplays your last-watched program upon startup by default, but it was the only service that allowed me to turn that feature off by heading to the settings.</p><p>Searching for and recording an upcoming game was easy. Once the game was recorded, I had to hunt a little to find it in my library (turns out single games are listed under the Events heading, not Sports). But after that, playback was simple and included a fascinating extra feature: You can either play a recorded game from the beginning or hit Watch Key Plays. The latter gives you between 12 and 20 highlight snippets, each about 10 seconds long. It focuses on the most impressive shots in an NBA bout and includes every goal in an MLS matchup. The feature was available for NCAA basketball and in-season major American leagues (hockey, soccer and basketball at the time of testing). Foreign and more minor games didn\u2019t have the feature.</p><p>Sports fans will also appreciate the new multiview feature that YouTube TV added earlier this year that lets you pick up to four sports, news and weather channels from a select list and view them all at the same time on your screen. If you find yourself constantly flipping back and forth between games, this could save you some hassle.</p><p>YouTube TV also gives you the most in-app settings. You can add parental controls to a profile or pull up a stats menu that shows your buffer health and connection speeds. You can lower playback resolution for slow connections and even send feedback to YouTube. It was also the best at integrating VOD and live programming. For example, if you search for a show that happens to be playing live, a red badge in the corner of the show\u2019s image lets you know it\u2019s on right now. Other services didn\u2019t display this info as clearly.</p><p>Now that YouTube TV is $73 per month, it's no longer cheaper than <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ca19dea0-e7ad-4f54-beed-6302bce56589&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Hulu&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjYTE5ZGVhMC1lN2FkLTRmNTQtYmVlZC02MzAyYmNlNTY1ODkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaHVsdS5jb20vbGl2ZS10diIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTBlYjM0ZGItYzBmYy00YmZiLWFiNDEtMWNiZTk3ZmFmZmQ4In0&amp;signature=AQAAASOsz4gSX7PSfobz14RykoXuU9OPnxuKEPPXAKT0mdHs&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hulu.com%2Flive-tv\">Hulu + Live TV</a>, which is $70. And if you already subscribe to the regular Hulu app, this is definitely the better better choice. Hulu's option gives you live TV streaming, plus all of Hulu\u2019s content, some of which you can't get elsewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Hulu + Live TV carries your local affiliates and 32 of the top 36 cable channels, which is the same number as YouTube TV. For sports, you get all available ESPN iterations plus FS1, FS2, TBS, USA, TNT, NBC Golf and the NFL Network. You can also add on premium VOD channels like Max and Showtime, and it\u2019s the only provider that includes Disney+ at no extra cost.</p><p>Navigation on Hulu + Live TV isn\u2019t as smooth as most of the other options \u2013 it felt like the live component had been shoehorned into the standard Hulu app. But if you\u2019re already comfortable with (and paying for) Hulu, upgrading to the live TV bundle might be worthwhile.</p><p><strong>YouTube TV</strong></p><ul><li><p>Base plan: $73/mo</p></li><li><p>Local channels: Yes</p></li><li><p>Top cable channels: 32 of 36</p></li><li><p>DVR limits: Unlimited, 9-month expiration</p></li><li><p>Profiles per account: 6</p></li><li><p>Simultaneous at-home streams: 3 (unlimited with upgrade)</p></li><li><p>Picture in picture mode: Yes</p></li></ul><p><strong>Hulu + Live TV</strong></p><ul><li><p>Base plan: $70/mo</p></li><li><p>Local channels: Yes</p></li><li><p>Top cable channels: 32 of 36</p></li><li><p>DVR limits: Unlimited, 9-month expiration</p></li><li><p>Profiles per account:  6</p></li><li><p>Simultaneous at-home streams: 2 (unlimited with upgrade)</p></li><li><p>Picture in picture mode: No</p></li></ul><h2>Best cable without a contract: DirecTV Stream</h2><p></p><p>Canceling cable is <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/brooklynninenine/comments/cgt6nq/i_need_you_to_cancel_my_cable/\">no joke</a> \u2013 those contracts are <em>binding</em>. But if you enjoy the serendipity of flipping from one channel to the next and having access to as many networks as possible, <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0cmVhbXR2LmRpcmVjdHYuY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTBlYjM0ZGItYzBmYy00YmZiLWFiNDEtMWNiZTk3ZmFmZmQ4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAdcf5W3Vm5-FJv1zdJ3KP6SN7FzIWHiSqW07po7lGxqU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fstreamtv.directv.com%2F\">DirecTV Stream</a> will give you a very similar experience to cable without shackling you to a contract. Like cable, it allows you to jump to the \u201cnext\u201d sequential channel (yes, DirecTV Stream numbers its channels) with a single button press, transforming the left and right d-pad buttons of a smart TV remote into the rocker on a standard clicker.</p><p>It carries all the top 36 cable networks (though Game Show Network and Animal Planet are only available at the second tier and above) and lets you add multiple packages and premiums like Showtime, Starz, AMC+ and Discovery+. You can also add Max, just like on YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV, but DirecTV is the only one we tried that lets you add Peacock. Of course, you can always add those apps separately to your smart TV, but for anyone who prefers the all-in-one convenience of cable, it\u2019s a nice perk.</p><p>When you fire up DirecTV Stream, whichever network you last watched automatically starts playing. It continues when you switch over to the guide or other menu pages. If you\u2019re used to the quieter experience of traditional streaming apps (after you turn off <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-06-netflix-autoplay-preview-settings.html\">autoplay</a>), you might find that a little distracting.</p><p>The navigation didn\u2019t feel intuitive, partly because the menu options overlay the currently playing show and because there are so many ways to browse, access and control live, recorded and on-demand content. The search function was the least integrated of the services I tested. Instead of live-suggesting as you type, it forces you to enter your full search term on a separate keyboard interface. Even with that limitation, it found the shows and movies I searched for and accurately presented the upcoming games I wanted just from typing in one of the teams.</p><p>You can\u2019t add new channels or packages through the app, which might be a relief to anyone worried about succumbing to subscription overload. Everyone else may just find it annoying.</p><ul><li><p>Base plan: $75/mo</p></li><li><p>Local channels: Yes</p></li><li><p>Top cable channels: 36 of 36</p></li><li><p>DVR limits: Unlimited, 9-month expiration (maximum of 30 episodes per series)</p></li><li><p>Profiles per account: 1</p></li><li><p>Simultaneous at-home streams: Unlimited</p></li><li><p>Picture in picture mode: No</p></li></ul><h2>Best for live sports: FuboTV</h2><p></p><p>If you want to stream live sports, you should probably opt for <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9a941868-c063-4b44-9207-896f1fb5891e&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=FuboTV&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5YTk0MTg2OC1jMDYzLTRiNDQtOTIwNy04OTZmMWZiNTg5MWUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnViby50di93ZWxjb21lIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1MGViMzRkYi1jMGZjLTRiZmItYWI0MS0xY2JlOTdmYWZmZDgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAd2jf7G-Y7GYxiqagnhDJbE-y7bjBQ2o8NrishZ2kMs7&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fubo.tv%2Fwelcome&amp;uuid=GAOsSarwKnnvMLLt30704\">FuboTV</a>. When you first sign up, it asks which teams you follow across all kinds of associations. Pick teams from in-season leagues and you\u2019ll quickly have DVR content to watch. That\u2019s because Fubo records every game your chosen teams play as long as it\u2019s aired on a supported channel \u2013 and its sports coverage is vast.</p><p>I tested out a premium subscription and the guide said there were 118 sports networks to choose from. In addition to the usual suspects from ESPN, Fox, NBC and CBS, you can watch motorsports, international leagues, adventure sports and even poker. Add-ons give you NBA TV, NHL Network, NFL Red Zone and MLB Network. And if you need access to all one thousand games the NBA plays in a season, you can add the NBA League Pass to your lineup for $15 per month. FuboTV even has its <em>own</em> sports channels.</p><p>Yes, the coverage is comprehensive, but FuboTV also made finding and recording specific games very easy. Searching for an upcoming game was simple, as was sifting through the ample amount of recorded games I ended up with. I particularly liked FanView for live games, which inserts the video into a smaller window and surrounds that window with continually updating stats plus a clickable list of other games currently airing.</p><p>FuboTV has made an obvious effort to win at sports, but recently it\u2019s tried to deliver on the live TV experience as well. Based on what I've seen so far, it's certainly made strides. The guide was impressive in the number of ways it let you organize live TV, yet everything felt clean and uncluttered. The Home, Sports, Shows and Movies pages were filled with recommendations and many iterations of categories, with almost all suggestions being live TV.</p><p>Where FuboTV falls short is in VOD access and DVR playback. It wasn\u2019t the best at finding the shows I searched for, and navigating available VOD content wasn\u2019t as breezy as browsing through live programming. The lack of a pop-up preview window as you fast forward or rewind through recordings makes it tough to gauge where you are in a show. As for price, FuboTV ties with DirecTV Stream for the most expensive base package at $75. But if you need <em>all</em> the sports \u2013 and want some nicely organized live TV during the few moments when there\u2019s not a game on \u2013 this is the way to go.</p><ul><li><p>Base plan: $75/mo</p></li><li><p>Local channels: Yes</p></li><li><p>Top cable channels: 29 of 36</p></li><li><p>DVR limits: 1000 hours, no expiration</p></li><li><p>Profiles per account: 6</p></li><li><p>Simultaneous at-home streams: 10</p></li><li><p>Picture in picture mode: Yes (Apple TV only)</p></li></ul><h2>Most customizable: Sling TV</h2><p></p><p>To me, the idea of spending time fine-tuning channel choices sounds exhausting. But if you\u2019re the type who wants to get exactly what you want without paying for too much of what you don\u2019t, <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=34c77505-6db4-4664-9320-2c38b4122d5e&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sling+TV&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNGM3NzUwNS02ZGI0LTQ2NjQtOTMyMC0yYzM4YjQxMjJkNWUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2xpbmcuY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTBlYjM0ZGItYzBmYy00YmZiLWFiNDEtMWNiZTk3ZmFmZmQ4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAQuX1x-8Li1Y3BleLw5tlSNrUlv0th9PPvhRuDrLsSQD&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sling.com%2F\">Sling TV</a> may be your best bet. It breaks its base plan into two packages, Blue and Orange, with different channels on each. Blue, which costs $45 a month, carries a larger number of networks, while Orange seems to have spent its lineup dollars on ESPN and ESPN 2. But at $40 monthly, Sling Orange is the cheapest way to get those two sports outlets.</p><p>After picking a plan, you can choose from a stable of add-on packages, with monthly prices ranging from $6 to $11. These include blocks of sports or lifestyle channels, kid-friendly fare, the Discovery+ bundle and a news package. There are 46 individual premium offerings, including Showtime, Starz, MGM+, Shudder and Acorn, which go for between $2 and $10 per month. Sling has pay-per-view movies, too.</p><p>As far as local coverage, Sling Blue grants access to ABC, Fox and NBC local affiliates in about 20 of the larger US markets including Los Angeles, Seattle, Dallas, NYC, Miami and DC. ABC coverage began in March 2023, but unfortunately, that raised the price of Sling Blue in supported markets from $40 to $45. For people not in those areas (or who opt for Orange) Sling is currently running a <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=34c77505-6db4-4664-9320-2c38b4122d5e&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sling+TV&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNGM3NzUwNS02ZGI0LTQ2NjQtOTMyMC0yYzM4YjQxMjJkNWUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2xpbmcuY29tL3Byb2dyYW1taW5nL2xvY2FsLWNoYW5uZWxzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1MGViMzRkYi1jMGZjLTRiZmItYWI0MS0xY2JlOTdmYWZmZDgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAe_a43827fNAzxdGbME6_g1Hxe1vYDxKcViw1EF1Ygsr&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sling.com%2Fprogramming%2Flocal-channels\">promotion</a> for a free HD antenna to catch local stations.</p><p>Navigation is speedy and the interface is nicely organized, putting an emphasis on what you like to watch, with recommendations that are pretty accurate. The UI also makes the add-ons you\u2019ve chosen easy to find. In my tests, though, the app froze a number of times as I navigated. While most services froze once or twice, it happened enough times with Sling to frustrate me. I had to force quit or back out of the app and start over five or six times during the three weeks of testing. Compared to others, Sling\u2019s DVR allowance is on the stingy side, only giving you 50 hours of recordings, though they won't expire. You can pay for more DVR storage, but that will increase your overall costs.</p><p>I tried not to wander too far off-path during testing, but I feel it\u2019s my duty to inform you that Sling has an Elvis channel, a Bob Ross channel and ALF TV (yes, an entire station devoted to the \u201880s sitcom starring a puppet).

If that\u2019s not an issue, Philo is great, with a clean, streamlined interface and generous DVR limits.</p><p>I\u2019m a fan of minimalist design, so I appreciated the way Philo presented its menus and guide. There are just four top navigation headings: Home, Guide, Saved and Search. And instead of the usual guide layout that stretches out or shortens a show\u2019s listing to represent its air time, Philo\u2019s guide features monospaced squares in chronological order with the duration of the program inside the square. Another nice touch is when you navigate to a square, it fills with a live video of the show or movie.</p><p>Philo doesn\u2019t limit the amount of programming you can DVR and lets you keep recordings for a full year, which is more than the nine months other providers allow. Like all live TV streamers, Philo won\u2019t let you fast forward VOD programming. If skipping commercials is important to you, I recommend taking advantage of that unlimited DVR policy and hitting \u201cSave\u201d on any show or movie you think you may want to watch, then fast forwarding it on playback (you can do this with all the services we tried).</p><p>As far as channels, Philo covers 23 of the top 36 cable networks, with notable exceptions including Fox News, CNN, ESPN and MSNBC. Anyone looking for great news coverage should look elsewhere anyway, but the lack of a few must-have entertainment outlets like Bravo and Freeform was a little disappointing.</p><ul><li><p>Base plan: $25/mo.</p></li><li><p>Local channels: No</p></li><li><p>Top cable channels: 23 of 36</p></li><li><p>DVR limits: Unlimited, one year expiration</p></li><li><p>Profiles per account: 10</p></li><li><p>Simultaneous streams: 3</p></li><li><p>Picture in picture mode: Yes (browser only)</p></li></ul>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-live-tv-streaming-service-133000410.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-live-tv-streaming-service-133000410.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-08-04T15:00:49+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Every Amazon division is working on generative AI projects", "description": "<p>Just like pretty much every other major tech company, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/amazon/\"><ins>Amazon</ins></a> is placing a heavy focus on generative artificial intelligence.

Innovations have the potential to transform the way we consume and analyze games from both an administrative and fan standpoint. For soccer specifically, there are opportunities for live game analytics, match outcome modeling, ball tracking, player recruitment, and even injury predicting \u2014 the opportunities are seemingly endless.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>&quot;I think that we're at the beginning of a tremendously sophisticated use of AI and advanced analytics to understand and predict human behaviors,&quot; Joel Shapiro, Northwestern University professor at the Kellogg School of Management said.

Cousins said he is personally excited about the potential impact of artificial intelligence on his company and, in fact, he is not threatened by the implementation of predictive analysis impacting SRUSA's bottom line. &quot;It probably will replace scouts,&quot; Cousins said, but at the same time, he said he believes the deployment of AI will make things more efficient. &quot;It will basically streamline resources \u2026 which will save organizations money.&quot; Cousins shared that SRUSA has already started dabbling with AI, even if only in a modest way. It collaborated with a company called <a href=\"https://www.veo.co/\">Veo</a> that deploys drones that follow players and collect video for scouts to analyze later.&nbsp;</p><p>Luis Cortell, senior recruiting coach for men\u2019s soccer for <a href=\"https://www.ncsasports.org/\">NCSA College Recruiting</a>, is a little less bullish, but still believes AI can be an asset. \u201cRight now, soccer involves more of a feel for the player, and an understanding of the game, and there aren't any success metrics for college performance.

The fact is, predictive models will always make mistakes but both researchers and investors alike want to make sure that AI innovations in the space can make &quot;fewer errors and less expensive errors&quot; than the ones made by human beings.</p><p>But ultimately, Shapiro agrees with Cousins. He believes artificial intelligence will replace some payrolls for sure. &quot;Might it replace talent scouts? Absolutely,&quot; he said. However, the ultimate decision-makers of how resources are being used will probably not be replaced by AI for some time. Contrary to both perspectives, Richard Felton-Thomas, director of sports sciences and chief operating officer at ai.io, said the technology being developed and used by the MLS will not replace scouts: \u201cScouts are super important to the mentality side, the personality side, you've still got to watch humans behave in their sporting arena to really talent ID them.\u201d</p><figure><img alt=\"McCormick professor Joel Shapiro teaches an analytics class Tuesday, Feb. 25, 2020 in Evanston, IL. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/69c112f0-315b-11ee-9dbb-2024c8989da0\" style=\"height: 4016px; width: 6016px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Rob Hart</div></figure><p>When the <a href=\"https://www.ai.io/players\">aiScout app</a> launches in the coming weeks and is used by the MLS later this year, players will be able to take videos of themselves performing specific drills. Those will then be uploaded and linked to the <a href=\"https://www.ai.io/clubs\">scout version of the app</a>, where talent recruiters working for specific teams can discover players based on whatever criteria they choose. For example, a scout could look for a goalie with a specific height and kick score. Think of it as a cross between a social media website and a search engine. Once a selection is made, a scout would determine whether or not they should go watch a player in person before making any final recruitment decisions, Felton-Thomas explained.</p><p>\u201cThe main AI actually happens less around the scoring and more around the video processing and the video tracking,\u201d Felton-Thomas said. \u201cSport happens at 200 frames per second type speeds, right? So you can\u2019t just have any old tracking model. It will not track the human fast enough.\u201d The AI algorithms that have been developed to analyze video content can translate human movements into what makes up a player\u2019s overall performance metrics and capabilities.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt=\"WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND - AUGUST 02: Seth Karunaratne (L) and Bozhidar Kraev take part in a drill during a Wellington Phoenix training session at NZCIS on August 02, 2023 in Wellington, New Zealand.

The <a href=\"https://www.fifa.com/technical/football-technology/innovation-programme\">FIFA Innovation Programme</a>, the experimental arm of the association that tests and engages with new products that want to enter the professional soccer market, reported that ai.io\u2019s AI-powered tools demonstrate a 97 percent accuracy level when compared to current gold standards.</p><p>Beyond the practical applications of AI-powered tools to streamline some processes at SRUSA, Cousins said that he recognizes a lot of the talent recruitment process is \u201cvery opinion based&quot; and informed by potential bias. ai.io's talent recruitment app, because it is accessible to any player with a smartphone, broadens the MLS\u2019 reach to disadvantaged populations. The larger goal is that aiScout will potentially disrupt bias from continuing to play a huge role in who gets what opportunity, or at least in the pre-screening process. Now, a scout can make the call to see a player in real life based on objective data related to how a player can perform physically. \u201cThe clubs are starting to realize we can't just rely on someone's opinion,\u201d Felton-Thomas said. Of course, it's not an end-all-be-all for bias, considering preferential humans are the ones coding the AI. There is no complete expunging of favoritism from the equation, but it is one step in the right direction.</p><p>aiScout could open doors for players from remote or disadvantaged communities that don't necessarily have the means or opportunity to be seen by scouts in cups and tournaments. &quot;Somebody super far in Alaska or Texas or whatever, who can't afford to play for a big club may never get seen by the right people but with this platform there, boom. They're going straight to the eyes of the right people,&quot; Cousins said about ai.io\u2019s app.</p><div id=\"c77409e430fa4e1eacc3e8fdbbc4ba07\"><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"border: 0; margin: 1px; padding: 0; width: 99.375%;\"><div style=\"padding: 16px;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CqJC2VltHql/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"padding: 0 0; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 100%;\" target=\"_blank\"><div style=\"display: flex;\"><div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div><div style=\"display: flex;\"><div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div><div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div></div></div><div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div><div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div><div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\"><div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal;\">View this post on Instagram</div></div><div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div><div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 14px;\"><div><div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px;\"></div><div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div><div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px;\"></div></div><div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\"><div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div><div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent;\"></div></div><div style=\"margin-left: auto;\"><div style=\"width: 0px; border-right: 8px solid transparent;\"></div><div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 12px; width: 16px;\"></div><div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-left: 8px solid transparent;\"></div></div></div><div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;\"><div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div><div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div></div></a><p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; white-space: nowrap;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CqJC2VltHql/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by SRUSA - \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 College Soccer Recruiting Agency (@sportsrecruitingusa)</a></p></div></blockquote></div><p>The <a href=\"https://www.mlssoccer.com/news/mls-ai-io-partnership-how-technology-can-transform-soccer-scouting\">MLS wrote in a statement</a> that ai.io's technology &quot;eliminates barriers like cost, geography and time commitment that traditionally limit the accessibility of talent discovery programs<a href=\"https://www.mlssoccer.com/news/mls-ai-io-partnership-how-technology-can-transform-soccer-scouting\">.</a>&quot; Felton-Thomas said it is more important to understand that ai.io will \u201cdemocratize\u201d the recruiting process for the MLS, ensuring physical skills are the most important metric when leagues and clubs are deciding where to invest their money. \u201cWhat we're looking to do is give the clubs a higher confidence level when they're making these decisions on who to sign and who to watch.\u201d By implementing the AI-powered app, recruitment timelines are also expected to be cut.</p><p>Silvia Ferrari, professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at Cornell and \u200b\u200bAssociate Dean for cross-campus engineering research, who runs the university's 'Laboratory for Intelligent Systems and Controls' said she couldn't agree more. AI has the potential to complement the expertise of recruiters while also helping, &quot;eliminate the bias that sometimes coaches might have for a particular player or a particular team,\u201d Ferrari said. Adjacent to this subject, <a href=\"https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2022/10/algorithms-predict-sports-teams-moves-80-accuracy\">algorithms developed in Ferrari's lab can accurately predict the in-game actions of volleyball players with more than 80% accuracy.</a> Now the lab, which has been working on AI-powered predictive tools for the past three years, is collaborating with Cornell's Big Red men's ice hockey team to expand the project\u2019s applications<em>. </em>Ferrari and her team have trained the algorithm to extract data from videos of games and then use that to make predictions about game stats and player performance when shown a new set of data.</p><figure><img alt=\"Photo series of a hockey player in AI model\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/5b851a20-2fc0-11ee-bd7f-02ccc38a637b\" style=\"height: 1053px; width: 1069px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">LISC lab</div></figure><p>&quot;I think what we're doing is, like, very easily applicable to soccer,&quot; Ferrari said. She said the only reason her lab is not focused on soccer is because the fields are so large that her team\u2019s cameras could not always deliver easily analyzed recordings. There is also the struggle with predicting trajectory and tracking the players, she explained. However, she said in hockey, the challenges are similar enough, but because there are fewer players and the fields are smaller, so the variables are more manageable to tackle.</p><p>While the focus at Ferrari\u2019s lab may not be soccer, she is convinced that research in the predictive AI space has made it \u201cso much more promising to develop AI in sports and made the progress much faster.&quot; The algorithms developed by Ferrari's lab have been able to help teams analyze different strategies and therefore help coaches identify the strengths and weaknesses of particular players and opponents. \u201cI think we're making very fast progress,&quot; Ferrari said.</p><figure><img alt=\"Photo series of a hockey player in AI model\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/5b858f50-2fc0-11ee-9df9-b7932b5d1520\" style=\"height: 916px; width: 912px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">LISC lab</div></figure><p>The next areas Ferrari plans to try to apply her lab\u2019s research to include scuba diving and skydiving. However, Ferrari admits there are some technical barriers that need to be overcome by researchers. &quot;The current challenge is real-time analytics,&quot; she said. A lot of that challenge is based on the fact that the technology is only capable of making predictions based on historical data. Meaning, if there is a shortage of historical data-there is a limit to what the tech can predict. Beyond technical limitations, Felton-Thomas said implementing AI in the real world is expensive and without the right partnerships, like the ones made with Intel and AWS, it would not have been possible fiscally.</p><p>Felton-Thomas said ai.io expects \u201ctens of millions of users over the next couple of years.\u201d And the company attributes that expected growth to partnerships with the right clubs, like Chelsea FC and Burnley FC in the UK, and the MLS in the United States. And while aiScout was initially designed for soccer, the company touts that its core functionalities can be adapted for use in other sports.</p><figure><img alt=\"AI image tracking hockey player on Cornell's Big Red team.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/103a7480-3221-11ee-b7ff-827b3558df51\" style=\"height: 520px; width: 1362px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">LISC lab</div></figure><p>But despite ai.io\u2019s projections for growth and all the buzz around AI, the technology is still a long way from being fully trusted. From a technology standpoint, Ferrari said \u201cthere's still a lot of work to be done\u201d and a lot of the need for improvement is not just based on problems with feeding algorithms historical data. Predictive models need to be smart enough to adapt to the ever-changing variables in the current. On top of that, public skepticism of artificial intelligence is still rampant in the mainstream, let alone in soccer.</p><p>\u201cIf the sport changes a little bit, if the way in which players are used changes a little bit, if treatment plans for mid-career athletes change, whatever it is, all of a sudden, our predictions are less likely to be good,\u201d Shapiro said. But he\u2019s confident that the current models will prove valuable and informative. At least for a little while.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/will-ai-revolutionize-professional-soccer-recruitment-130045118.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/will-ai-revolutionize-professional-soccer-recruitment-130045118.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-08-04T13:00:45+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Google's Pixel Buds Pro are back on sale for $140", "description": "<p>High-end earbuds are not typically impulse buys, but Wellbots is offering a significant discount on Google\u2019s Pixel Buds Pro earbuds that just about does the trick.

Luckily, interested parties will only need to put down a $2,000 deposit which is just 0.5 percent of the purchase price.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt=\"Henrik Fisker, CEO of electric-vehicle maker Fisker Inc., shows off Alaska pickup truck in Huntington Beach, California, August 3, 2023.

It's based on the Ocean (and built on the same platform), but has a pickup truck bed and midgate that lowers to extend the bed into the cabin \u2014 allowing it to haul longer cargo than the shortish bed would suggest. That's much like Chevy's new <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/chevrolet-silverado-ev-details-ces-debut-171551300.html\">Silverado EV</a>, which it strikingly resembles.&nbsp;</p><p>The Alaska will start at $45,400 (it will be US-built and qualify for EV incentives) with a range of around 230 miles between charges, less than the Ocean. However, the company is promising a more expensive model that can go up to 340 miles between charges. Because it's based around the Ocean which is now in production, the company expects it to go on sale as early as December 2024 \u2014 sooner than the Pear or Ronin. Henrik Fisker is much better at designing vehicles than estimating prices and production schedules, though, so take all those numbers and dates with a large grain of salt.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt=\"Electric-vehicle maker Fisker Inc. introduces the PEAR electric vehicle  in Huntington Beach, California, August 3, 2023.

While just a bit smaller than the Ocean, it will be built on a new platform that allows a 35 percent reduction in parts and thus a lower price. It will come in five- or six-seat layouts (the latter via a front bench seat), and offers what looks like an attractive but basic interior for the price.</p><p>Other touches include a &quot;Houdini Trunk&quot; lift gate designed to simplify cargo loading, along with a frunk (or &quot;froot&quot; in Fisker's nomenclature). It also offers LED lighting and a &quot;lounge mode&quot; that lets you move the seats around to maximize comfort. Fisker plans to build the Pear at Foxconn's Lordstown plant so it's eligible for tax incentives, with production estimated around mid-2025. Again, treat those price and production estimates skeptically.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt=\"Henrik Fisker, CEO of electric-vehicle maker Fisker Inc.shows off the Ocean Force E electric SUV  in Huntington Beach, California, August 3, 2023.

He then authorized 2,000 transactions to move 119,754 bitcoins to wallets he controlled. To cover his tracks, he said he deleted access credentials, logs and other digital breadcrumbs that could give him away.

They then withdrew the funds and distributed the bitcoins from there by converting them into other forms of cryptocurrency and keeping them in crypto mixing services.
