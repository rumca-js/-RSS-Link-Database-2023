By July 29th, Typhoon Doksuri grazed Taiwan before making its way toward the coastal Chinese province of Fujian. In theory, the island of Taiwan acts as a strong barrier to extreme weather, blocking Pacific typhoons from reaching the southeastern Chinese coast. 
This year’s Typhoon Doksuri followed this pattern, bypassing Taiwan and making landfall in Fujian. With winds reaching 191 kilometers per hour or 118 miles per hour, it became the second-strongest typhoon in the province’s history. It’s also one of the strongest typhoons to hit southeast China in the last century. 
How did it impact China? Mainland media reported that in some parts of the country, the amount of rainfall that would have normally spanned about two years came down over the space of two days.
