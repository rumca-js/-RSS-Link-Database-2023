One way to ensure your connection is private is to employ the services of a VPN, and <a href=\"https://software.pcworld.com/p36561-avg_secure_vpn_2023_10-d_1-yr\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AVG Secure VPN</a> can be deployed across all your connected devices &ndash; mobile and desktop &ndash; to keep you safe and private wherever you are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Better still, we&rsquo;ve teamed up with AVG to secure you an incredible deal that will give you 12 months&rsquo; VPN protection for up to 10 devices <a href=\"https://software.pcworld.com/p36561-avg_secure_vpn_2023_10-d_1-yr\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">for just $9.99</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes AVG Secure VPN stand out from the competition? First, it can be installed across all your devices &ndash; Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS &ndash; and used on up to 10 of them simultaneously, allowing you to cover your entire family&rsquo;s needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, you can select servers from over 50 locations, allowing you to mask your true location plus bypass certain geo-restrictions by appearing to be at home while abroad, for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Third, there&rsquo;s an optional kill switch to ensure your connection isn&rsquo;t compromised should you be disconnected for any reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fourth, AVG Secure VPN uses the latest VPN protocols &ndash; including Wireguard and OpenVPN &ndash; to ensure your connection is as fast, secure and stable as it can be, all backed up by industry standard 256-bit AES encryption.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, AVG Secure VPN is incredibly easy to use. Once installed and set up, simply flick the VPN switch to On to immediately encrypt your connection through the fastest available server, or click the Change button to select your country and &ndash; if applicable &ndash; specific server within that country. There are 16 US locations, plus 2-3 locations in Spain, the UK, Canada, Germany, and Australia. You&rsquo;ll also see recommendations for countries where anonymous peer-to-peer transfers can be conducted without attracting any attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ordinarily, AVG Secure VPN would set you back $79.99 a year for this comprehensive protection, but we&rsquo;ve secured a great deal, so you only have to <a href=\"https://software.pcworld.com/p36561-avg_secure_vpn_2023_10-d_1-yr\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pay $9.99 for a 12-month, 10-device subscription</a>, saving you 88% on the MSRP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How to protect your family</strong><br />Start by downloading and installing AVG Secure VPN on your Windows PC and/or Mac &ndash; you can also download it through the Android and iOS app stores. Once installed, purchase your license, then open the app, log into your AVG account (or set up a free one when prompted), then either click &lsquo;Enter activation code&rsquo; from the sign-in screen or access the option from the menu screen to input the code you received after purchase</p>\n\nVPN</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2020961/88-off-12-months-of-avg-secure-vpn-2023-just-9-99.html", "date_published": "2023-08-04T19:41:44+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Google now alerts you if your contact info appears online", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in September, Google launched a way to remove search results showing personal contact info&mdash;details like your home address, phone number, and email address. You could make the request<strong> </strong>from any method of accessing Google search, then monitor the status of your request(s) from its new Results About You tool. But you still had to stay on top of search results about you. Now the company has rolled out some updates to the tool to alleviate some of that work (and stress)&mdash;as well as introducing a further way to protect your privacy online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Promised to arrive in &ldquo;the coming days,&rdquo; the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blog.google/products/search/new-privacy-tools/&amp;xcust=2-1-2020950-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Results About You&rsquo;s new dashboard</a> will both show you existing search results containing your contact info and also automatically alert you if those personal details again pop up later on. You&rsquo;ll still need to manually submit removal requests, however. And as noted by <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/google/google-makes-it-easier-to-remove-your-info-explicit-images-from-search/&amp;xcust=2-1-2020950-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bleeping Computer</a>, the company will still screen requests to make sure it doesn&rsquo;t take down results tied to information that is &ldquo;broadly useful,&rdquo; like in news articles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can access the Results About You tool in the Google app by clicking on your Google account photo and choosing &ldquo;Results about you.&rdquo; Alternatively, you can visit <em>goo.gle/resultsaboutyou</em>. This update will only be available in English and within the U.S. to start, but other languages and locations are &ldquo;soon&rdquo; to follow.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage center\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img alt=\"Results about you animated gif \" class=\"wp-image-2020958\" height=\"435\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Results_about_you.gif\" width=\"275\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Google</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Non-consensual explicit imagery is also becoming easier to remove from search. Google says it&rsquo;s streamlined <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/6302812?sjid=4513421796172596113-NA&amp;xcust=2-1-2020950-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">the process for making such requests</a>, though as part of the announcement, VP of Trust Danielle Romain stressed that the policy still does not extend to commercialized images. (Though presumably, the redistribution of such material would fall under copyright protection if you created the content.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google also will begin handling explicit images in a different manner&mdash;by default, these images will be blurred if they come up in search results. The company says this change, which will launch in August, is to help protect families from &ldquo;accidentally encountering&rdquo; adult or graphic violent images while searching online. Parental controls can now be directly found by typing in a search like &ldquo;google parental controls&rdquo; or &ldquo;google family link&rdquo; into the search box, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As before, removing search results linking to explicit material&mdash;or your personal contact info&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t actually take it off the web. Removal of the search info does limit how easily it&rsquo;s found, however.</p>\n\nOnline Services</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2020950/google-now-alerts-you-if-your-contact-info-appears-online.html", "date_published": "2023-08-04T19:41:13+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Linux overtakes Macs on Steam thanks to the Steam Deck", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>No, Macs have never been a serious gamer&rsquo;s first choice.

The explanation? Probably Valve&rsquo;s own <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1501480/master-your-steam-deck-with-these-22-tips-and-tricks.html\">Steam Deck gaming handheld</a>. The breakout device runs on Valve&rsquo;s custom Linux-based Steam OS and intensely marketed (and praised) over the past year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps we shouldn&rsquo;t make too much of these tiny overall numbers, but it&rsquo;s not an understatement to say that Apple has a long way to go when it comes to gaming. Even though Apple&rsquo;s home-grown M1 and M2 chips offer decent gaming performance, the company needs to speed up the number of games released for Mac OS if it wants to make some serious inroads with gamers.

But there are a number of scenarios where it makes sense to download videos for later viewing. If you want to watch a video on the train or bus, for example, or if films threaten to disappear from a media library. The <a href=\"http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=14154&amp;GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Video-Audio-Downloader-software-YouTube/dp/B0C46GX5J4?ascsubtag=2-1-2012328-1-0-0\" rel=\"nofollow\">$19.99 Video and Audio Downloader Pro 2 software</a> was made for just those cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The software can download audio and videos not just from YouTube, but also from all public media libraries and save them on your local storage. In our testing, this worked smoothly even while downloading several videos simultaneously, and even with 8K resolution videos. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Downloading media is not possible if the videos are behind a paywall, however; Video and Audio Downloader Pro 2 cannot download Netflix or Disney Plus videos, for example. This is also explained in the documentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Downloading playlists from YouTube is a new function in version 2 of the software and worked without any problems in our testing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Operating the software couldn&rsquo;t be any simpler. You simply surf to a video (or playlist) in your browser, copy the link from its address bar, and paste it into the input field of the software.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=14154&amp;GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Video-Audio-Downloader-software-YouTube/dp/B0C46GX5J4?ascsubtag=2-1-2012328-1-0-0\" rel=\"nofollow\">Video and Audio Downloader Pro 2</a> offers a simple download option for free streaming videos that are not behind a paywall.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"cta wp-block wp-block-button\"><a class=\"cta__btn\" href=\"http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=14154&amp;GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Video-Audio-Downloader-software-YouTube/dp/B0C46GX5J4?ascsubtag=2-1-2012328-7-0-0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Get Video and Audio Downloader Pro 2 at Amazon for $19.99</a></p>\nPersonal Software</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2012328/review-video-and-audio-downloader-pro-2.html", "date_published": "2023-08-04T16:46:51+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Best budget gaming mice 2023: Top performers, best for esports, and more", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>When your K/D tally is at stake it&rsquo;s pretty tempting to buy a premium gaming mouse with all the latest bells and whistles. But that can be a costly move that can see you paying upwards of $150 USD&mdash;that&rsquo;s coin that could go towards a brand-new processor instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The truth is you won&rsquo;t lose much performance going for a cheaper option.

We&rsquo;ve already done the research on your behalf by extensively testing a cohort of mice, sorting the wheat from the chaff, so that what&rsquo;s left is the best of the best.

It features 13 programmable button options in all, including highly sought-after DPI up/down buttons and a four-button mouse wheel.

I especially like a new, improved rubber thumb grip that replaces the plastic one from the G502, and the mouse&rsquo;s longer dimensions that make it a much better fit for large hands.  </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1666963/logitech-g502x-mouse-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLogitech G502X review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ad page-ad has-ad-prefix ad-article\"></div>\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-separator\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart-item product-chart-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper--title product-chart-title \" id=\"roccat-kone-pro-best-wired-budget-gaming-mouse-runner-up\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRoccat Kone Pro &ndash; Best wired budget gaming mouse runner-up\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"large-pro-cons-product-chart-section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproduct-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper--large\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Roccat Kone Pro - Best wired budget gaming mouse runner-up\" class=\"product-chart-item__image\" height=\"3024\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/lead-image-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"4032\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-columns\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tThe 19,000 DPI sensor is very precise, and the buttons are quick and clicky\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tAn ingenious design elevates your index finger ready to fire\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tA lightweight body adds to its speed and precision and prevents fatigue\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tNo dedicated DPI button means you can't as easily switch DPI settings\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tWired connectivity only, so you'll need to plug it in to play\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tThe mouse wheel lacks lateral left / right clicks\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__information \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-label\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"not-amp\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.roccat.com/products/kone-pro&amp;xcust=2-1-917138-6-1434528-14628&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$39.99 at  ROCCAT</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>The wired Roccat Kone Pro is designed for precise targeting thanks to its lightweight design and formidable 19,000 Owl-Eye DPI sensor, which in our playtesting proved an excellent performer in fast-paced FPS games.

What sets it apart is that it weighs just 61 grams&mdash;that&rsquo;s a few grams less than more expensive pro-grade esports mice like the Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro and Logitech G X Pro Superlight. Suffice to say it&rsquo;s super quick off the mark. </p>\n\n<p>Achieving such a lightweight design is quite an extraordinary feat by HyperX for two reasons: The Pulsefire Haste 2 has a hard top back rather than the perforated one we saw in its predecessor the Haste 1, which also means it&rsquo;s better suited to claw grippers. It also sports Bluetooth as well as 2.4GHz Wi-Fi connectivity, the extra Bluetooth functionality being still a rarity among pro-grade esports mice. All these factors make it one of the best value esports mice you can buy right now. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1987896/hyperx-pulsefire-haste-2-wireless-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 Wireless review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ad page-ad has-ad-prefix ad-article\"></div>\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-separator\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart-item product-chart-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper--title product-chart-title \" id=\"hyperx-pulsefire-haste-wireless-best-for-esports-runner-up\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHyperX Pulsefire Haste Wireless &ndash; Best for esports runner-up \t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"large-pro-cons-product-chart-section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproduct-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper--large\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"HyperX Pulsefire Haste Wireless - Best for esports runner-up \" class=\"product-chart-item__image\" height=\"3024\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/HyperX.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"4032\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-columns\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tWeighs just 61 grams\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tHas a highly accurate sensor\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tDesign is comfortable and aids performance\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tLacks Bluetooth\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tButton configuration is dull\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tHas only one RGB lighting zone\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__information \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"not-amp\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/321564/633495/10014?prodsku=6500796&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.bestbuy.com%2Fclick%2F-%2F6500796%2Fpdp&amp;intsrc=CATF_4831&amp;subid1=2-1-917138-6-792408-15520\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$59.99 at  Best Buy</a><a class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://hyperx.com/products/hyperx-pulsefire-haste-wireless?variant=42010625638557&amp;xcust=2-1-917138-6-792408-15520&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$59.99 at  HyperX</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p><span>The HyperX Pulsefire Haste Wireless is built on the back of its wired counterpart&rsquo;s esports pedigree so it&rsquo;s ideal for competitive gaming, but with the bonus of being tether-free and portable.

Although, as a general guide, you shouldn&rsquo;t pay more than $90 for a budget gaming mouse&mdash;that being the absolute maximum cost of the most feature-stacked budget gaming mice you can get.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditional wired gaming mice with six-button configurations tend to be some of the most affordable these days, with excellent value-for-money options like the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/827659/logitech-g203-lightsync-gaming-mouse-review.html\">Logitech G203 Lightsync</a>, providing gamers with just about everything they&rsquo;d want for casual gaming for around $25. Expect to pay a little more for a wireless mouse, such as the $50 USD <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1525656/keychron-m3-gaming-mouse.html\">Keychron M3 Wireless</a>, whose tetherless design makes it a much more portable device.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-shape-mouse-do-i-need\">What shape mouse do I need?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many budget gaming mice share the same design as their premium counterparts, so chances are you may already be familiar with a design you like that feels comfortable. If you&rsquo;re starting from scratch, first off you&rsquo;ll want to find a mouse with a shape that fits your dominant gaming hand. There are three main shapes: left-handed, right-handed, and ambidextrous.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Left and right-handed mice are just what their names suggest&mdash;mice designed to accommodate left or right hands. These mice come with design characteristics that provide advantages to left- or right-handed users, including curves to follow the contours of their hands and button configurations that can be more easily reached.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, ambidextrous mice are designed to be used by either hand. These mice sport a more neutral shape, which is usually quite symmetrical. Ambidextrous mice are quite often favored by competitive gamers who like the predictable way they move</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-size-mouse-is-right-for-me\">What size mouse is right for me?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like a new pair of sneakers, you&rsquo;re going to be spending a lot of time with your gaming mouse, so if it&rsquo;s a lousy fit you&rsquo;re not going to be comfortable and that&rsquo;s going to affect your performance. Mice tend to fit into three main size categories, small, medium, and large. To find a mouse that best fits your hand size you can use this simple size guide: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Small gaming mouse: </strong>Length: Less than 6.7 inches; width: 2.9 to 3.3 inches </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Medium gaming mouse:</strong> Length: 6.7 to 7.9 inches; width: 3.9 to 4.3 inches </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Large gaming mouse:</strong> Length: 7.9 inches; width; 3.9 to 4.3 inches</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-mouse-suits-my-grip-style\">What mouse suits my grip style?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The way you hold your mouse should fit into one of three main grip styles: a palm grip, claw grip, or fingertip grip. While you can essentially ignore your grip style altogether and play with any gaming mouse you choose, if you&rsquo;re looking to maximize performance, you&rsquo;ll want a mouse that gives you the most control for your grip. Here&rsquo;s a guide for what to look for:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Palm grip:</strong> Long, flat mice tend to be a better fit and more comfortable</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Claw grip:</strong> Narrower and smaller mice tend to suit this grip style</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Fingertip grip:</strong> Lighter mice are often preferred by fingertip grippers to reduce strain</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-many-buttons-do-i-need\">How many buttons do I need?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your mouse&rsquo;s button count will limit the number of commands and macros you can apply in-game, and it can also affect the mouse&rsquo;s weight, which can ultimately impact gaming performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ideally, the number of buttons you need should be informed by the types of games you like to play. For example, if you play a lot of first-person shooters, then keeping your mouse&rsquo;s weight to an absolute minimum with a small button count is of paramount importance. In this case a standard six-button mouse is perfect, providing enough functionality for at least six commands, but optimizing weight for movement and targeting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, if you predominately play role-playing games (RPGs), or massively multiplayer online games (MMOs), a mouse with from 10 to 18 buttons is preferable since you&rsquo;ll have more options for the myriad commands these games require. These days you can also get mice like the Roccat Kone XP that allow you to customize buttons with extra functions, which greatly increases the number of commands you can deploy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-dpi-sensor-should-i-look-for\">What DPI sensor should I look for?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to performance a lot of emphasis is placed on the DPI (dots per inch) resolution of a gaming mouse&rsquo;s sensor, with manufacturers touting the benefits of top-of-the-line mice with sensors between 20,000 to 30,000 DPI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With some exceptions, budget gaming mice tend to have sensors that are much lower in DPI resolution than premium models, which by the same thinking should mean they&rsquo;re a lot less capable. But that&rsquo;s simply not the case. In fact, budget gaming mice with sensors as low as 8,000 to 12,000 DPI can still track movement faster than what the human eye can perceive, and, with the exception of some competitive gaming scenarios, can be just as capable performers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The takeaway is, while it doesn&rsquo;t hurt to purchase a mouse with the highest DPI sensor as your budget will allow, you should also place just as much importance on other factors like the mouse&rsquo;s weight and its button configuration, which can be just as important as your mouse&rsquo;s sensor when it comes to performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-light-should-my-mouse-be\">How light should my mouse be?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Weight comes down to personal preference. <span style=\"font-size: revert; color: initial;\">Some gamers (especially those that play FPS games) swear by lightweight mice for quicker movement and aiming and to prevent soreness in long gaming sessions, while others prefer the consistent feeling of a heavier mouse.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size: revert; color: initial;\">That said, manufacturers continue to make lighter mice each year. This year we&rsquo;ve seen a bucket load of new releases that weigh much less than their predecessors&mdash;some six-button mice are even breaking the previously unheard of 60-gram mark.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size: revert; color: initial;\">You may find it difficult to find a budget mouse that light, since the lightest mice usually carry the most premium price tags. A more realistic weight is anything below 100 grams, it being kind of an unspoken benchmark for optimal mouse weight among serious gamers.</span> The <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1987896/hyperx-pulsefire-haste-2-wireless-review.html\">HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2</a> is one mouse that is extremely lightweight for its $89.99 price tag weighing just 61 grams. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"whats-the-best-budget-gaming-mice-for-kids\">What&rsquo;s the best budget gaming mice for kids?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most kids have smaller hands than adults, so if you have kids, you&rsquo;d be best advised to get a compact gaming mouse like the Razer Viper Mini, Corsair Scimitar Pro, or Logitech G203 Lightsync. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to moderately sized dimensions, these mice pack gaming-grade sensors and quick switches in their buttons so your kids won&rsquo;t miss out on any performance advantage in games. If you have older teenagers, any medium-sized gaming mouse like the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1987896/hyperx-pulsefire-haste-2-wireless-review.html\">HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2</a> will do just fine, since older teenager&rsquo;s hands tend to be proportionally as big as most adults. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"> <strong>    </strong></h3>\n\nGaming, Mice</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/917138/best-budget-gaming-mice.html", "date_published": "2023-08-04T16:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Asus Zenbook 15 OLED (2023) review: Gorgeous, light, and packed with ports", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n<div class=\"review\" id=\"review-body\"><span class=\"review-title\">At a glance</span><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"experts-rating\">Expert's Rating</h3><div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n<div><div class=\"review-columns\"><div class=\"review-column\"><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"pros\">Pros</h3><ul class=\"pros review-list\"><li>Lightweight and compact</li><li>Great OLED display</li><li>Lots of ports, including fast USB4</li><li>Good overall performance</li></ul></div><div class=\"review-column\"><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"cons\">Cons</h3><ul class=\"cons review-list\"><li>Mediocre battery life</li><li>Noisy fans</li></ul></div></div></div><h3 class=\"review-subTitle review-subTitle--borderTop\" id=\"our-verdict\">Our Verdict</h3><p class=\"verdict\">The  Zenbook 15 OLED is a well-built, attractive laptop with decent performance, an excellent display and good connectivity.

The display does wobble when you tilt it, which is the only thing that spoils the otherwise high-end look and feel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"The Type-A USB port on the left hand edge of the Asus Zenbook 15 OLED\" class=\"wp-image-2012711\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Asus-Zenbook-15-OLED-2023-review-left-side-ports.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"> </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Thomas Newton / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>While this shade of dark blue has been the norm for Asus Zenbooks for a while, in a sea of bland black &lsquo;n silver laptop conformity, it&rsquo;s refreshing to see something a bit different. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It follows on from the design reboot of last year&rsquo;s Zenbook 14 (UX3402) in that the Asus &lsquo;A&rsquo; logo is etched into the back, but while the 180&deg; hinge is slightly raised, the display isn&rsquo;t lifted off the desk as much as previous models.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading toc\" id=\"ports-connectivity\">Ports &amp; connectivity</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Two USB-C (one USB4), one USB-A</li>\n\n\n\n<li>USB4 port can be combined with Ethernet adapter</li>\n\n\n\n<li>HDMI 2.1 supports 4K video up to 120fps</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wi-Fi 6E (802.11ax), Bluetooth 5.2</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the super-slim dimensions, Asus has been able to pack in more than just a couple of ports here. There&rsquo;s an old-school Type-A USB 3.2 port, plus two Type-C USBs (one USB 3.2, one USB4) and an HDMI 2.1 port.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you also get a 3.5mm audio jack, there&rsquo;s no dedicated port for the mains adapter, but both of those Type-C USBs support power delivery. In case you need to expand storage, there are plenty of <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/402858/the-best-usb-c-hubs-for-your-laptop-tablet-or-2-in-1.html\">docks and hubs</a> (and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/395115/the-best-usb-c-cables-for-charging-and-transferring-data.html\">cables</a>) out there, so you can put that USB4 port to good use.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Asus has been able to pack in more than just a couple of ports here</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Neither of the USB-C ports support Thunderbolt 4 though, so keep that in mind if you&rsquo;re also looking to connect to Thunderbolt monitors or external GPUs.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"The Type-C USB, 3.5mm, and HDMI 2.1 ports of the Asus Zenbook 15 OLED (2023)\" class=\"wp-image-2012707\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Asus-Zenbook-15-OLED-2023-review-right-side-ports.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"> </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Thomas Newton / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>A key point about the USB4 port is that it can, with an Ethernet adapter, support wired internet connections. For times when you&rsquo;re nowhere near a wired access point, you&rsquo;ve got a Wi-Fi 6E unit sitting under the hood, allowing you to enjoy some of the fastest Wi-Fi speeds currently going.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, you have an HDMI 2.1 port, a nice uptick from the HDMI 2.0b port from last year&rsquo;s Zenbook 14. It means you can connect to a monitor and play 4K video at 120fps or 8K video at 60fps.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"A hand pressing the W and A keys of the Asus Zenbook 15 OLED laptop\" class=\"wp-image-2012712\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Asus-Zenbook-15-OLED-2023-review-keyboard-detail.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"> </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Thomas Newton / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading toc\" id=\"keyboard-trackpad\">Keyboard &amp; trackpad</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Good keyboard overall</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Some of the key positions and sizes feel awkward</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Trackpad is large and super-responsive</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The typing experience is impressive, with each letter key providing nice springy feedback and exhibiting travel of just under 2mm. It feels a lot deeper than you might expect, given the laptop&rsquo;s dimensions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, the row of number keys require a bit more force to action than the letter keys do, making for a slightly inconsistent feel. The keycaps also feel a little thin, which could impact their effectiveness long term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A number pad has been included, but whether this is a good thing or not is subjective. Generally, I don&rsquo;t like having number pads on laptop keyboards. I don&rsquo;t feel like they&rsquo;re a good use of space and tend to feel cramped, as is the case here.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>The typing experience is impressive, with each letter key providing nice springy feedback</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But I have fairly larger hands, so it might not be an issue for some people. But the function keys at the very top are too small, to the extent that I would sometimes find myself accidentally raising the volume instead of dimming the brightness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would also prefer it if navigation keys (home, page up, page down, end) weren&rsquo;t mapped onto the arrow keys, requiring you to hold the Fn key to action those commands. But this isn&rsquo;t unique to the Zenbook by any means.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The trackpad is a nice size (measuring 5.8in) and very responsive, allowing you to easily sweep through menus and execute precise gestures. Asus has done away with its ScreenPad here, a cool-but-confusing feature which saw a secondary display incorporated into the trackpad. Here, the trackpad is just a trackpad.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"The Asus Zenbook 15 OLED's keyboard\" class=\"wp-image-2012715\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Asus-Zenbook-15-OLED-2023-review-keyboard.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"> </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Thomas Newton / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading toc\">Display &amp; speakers<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>2.8K (2880 x 1620) 16:9 120Hz 15.6in OLED&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Full coverage of the sRGB and DCI-P3 colour space</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Almost full coverage of DCI-P3 space&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two display versions of the Asus Zenbook 15 available this year, one with an OLED screen and another with the more common IPS LCD panel. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The model I&rsquo;m testing here is the OLED version, which has a resolution of 2880 x 1620.

It took just over two minutes (2:15) to open 500MB worth of photos in image editing tool GIMP, which is pretty speedy. Mundane tasks such as firing off emails to colleagues and contacts felt slightly decadent.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Mundane tasks such as firing off emails to colleagues and contacts felt slightly decadent</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While the Zenbook 15 OLED is not a gaming laptop, I was pleased to be able to run an entire game of <em>Civ 6</em> on this (albeit on the lowest settings) without encountering any slowdown or crashes &ndash; not bad for a laptop without dedicated graphics. Then again, <em>Civ 6</em> isn&rsquo;t exactly a new game, so don&rsquo;t expect to be playing any recent titles with shading and texture settings cranked up.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sadly, the fans have a tendency to kick in if you find yourself doing anything more advanced than browsing the web, and they&rsquo;re certainly not quiet. Luckily, there are plenty of great noise-cancelling headphones out there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared with the Asus Zenbook 14X OLED, which uses an Intel Core i7-13700H processor, the Zenbook 15 OLED isn&rsquo;t as good when it comes to Geekbench 6 &ndash; 9469 vs 12024 on multi-core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking at PC Mark 10, which simulates a range of real-world PC tasks, it&rsquo;s a different story, with the Zenbook 15 beating its counterpart.

For example, someone over at AMD licensee PowerColor is in a heap of hurt right now, because the company accidentally posted a full listing for the Radeon RX 7800 XT graphics card, complete with specifications. Does that GPU sound unfamiliar? That&rsquo;s probably because the Radeon RX 7800 XT doesn&rsquo;t officially exist yet. Oops. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s been a mid-range hole in AMD&rsquo;s Radeon 7000 series since it launched last year, with the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1928214/amd-radeon-rx-7600-review.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">low-end RX 7600 at $270</a> being the only other card besides the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1431755/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-radeon-rx-7900-xt-review-rdna-3.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$900 RX 7900 XT and $1000 RX 7900 XTX</a>. AMD has confirmed that new &ldquo;enthusiast&rdquo; cards are coming <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2016950/amd-says-mid-range-radeon-7000-cards-will-be-here-soon.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">before the end of October</a>, presumably in between those two price points and at the 7700/7800 level. But PowerColor&rsquo;s full-page listing, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/All_The_Watts/status/1687167660839325697&amp;xcust=2-1-2020523-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">shared on Twitter almost immediately</a> and since taken down, is more or less an official confirmation of its existence. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the page, the PowerColor RX 7800 XT &ldquo;Red Devil&rdquo; will use a new Navi 32 GPU design with 3840 stream processors, 60 compute units, a 256-bit memory interface with 576GB/s bandwidth (the same as the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2011885/amd-launches-radeon-rx-7900-but-you-cant-have-it.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">China-only RX 7900 GRE</a>). 16GB of GDDR6 memory puts it a bit below the RX 7900 XT in hardware power, though it&rsquo;s using a slightly faster 2.565GHz boosted clock. There&rsquo;s no word on a price or release date (except &ldquo;third quarter&rdquo; from the AMD earnings call), and if there&rsquo;s an RX 7700 card out there, we don&rsquo;t know about it yet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://videocardz.com/newz/powercolor-leaks-radeon-rx-7800-xt-red-devil-navi-32-with-3840-cores-and-16gb-confirmed&amp;xcust=2-1-2020523-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">VideoCardz.com</a> recorded the text and images before they disappeared, noting that you&rsquo;ll want at least an 800-watt power supply to run the card even though there&rsquo;s no figure for peak power draw. The images show a standard dual-slot design, though it could be chunkier (possibly 2.5 slots or a little more) with a triple-fan cooling setup and dual 8-pin power connections. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though we don&rsquo;t have an official price, we can extrapolate based on the card level and previous releases. Since the Radeon RX 6800 XT launched at a retail price of $650 in 2020, I would budget at least $600 if you&rsquo;re hoping to buy an RX 7800 XT when it comes out. When? Sometime in the next three months, if Lisa Su&rsquo;s announced timetable holds. PowerColor&rsquo;s leak indicates it might be sooner than later.</p>\n\nGraphics Cards</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2020523/powercolor-spills-the-beans-on-the-unannounced-radeon-rx-7800-xt.html", "date_published": "2023-08-04T15:31:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "The best back-to-school HP laptop deals in 2023", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Much to the bemoan of students everywhere in the United States, back-to-school season is in full swing.

It&rsquo;s easy to see why, as battery life is crazy long and they&rsquo;re largely virus-free. Although they&rsquo;ve been popular in the education market for quite some time, they&rsquo;ve gotten powerful enough to attract mainstream appeal. If you prefer ChromeOS over Windows or macOS, you should definitely check out the recommendations below. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hp-chromebook-15a-na0047nr&amp;xcust=2-1-2018848-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">HP Chromebook 15a</a>, Intel Pentium Silver N6000 CPU/UHD graphics/8GB RAM/64GB eMMC/15.6-inch 1080p display, <strong>$319.99 ($80 off at HP)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hp-chromebook-x360-14b-cb0097nr&amp;xcust=2-1-2018848-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">HP Chromebook x360</a>, Intel Pentium Silver Silver N6000 CPU/UHD graphics/8GB RAM/128GB eMMC/14-inch 768p touch display, <strong>$359.99 ($130 off at HP</strong>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hp-elite-dragonfly-135-inch-chromebook&amp;xcust=2-1-2018848-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook</a>, Intel Core i3-1215U CPU/UHD graphics/8GB RAM/128GB SSD/13.5-inch 1504p touch display, <strong>$999 ($150 off at HP) </strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Out of all the deals above, the best bang is the first option, the HP Chromebook 15a. The Intel Pentium Silver N6000 isn&rsquo;t the fastest CPU we&rsquo;ve ever played around with, but it&rsquo;s good enough for everyday tasks like responding to e-mail and researching topics.

However, if portability is at the top of your priority list, then you best stick around. Most older students will likely take their laptop to classes with them, so it&rsquo;s important to travel light. If you&rsquo;re in the market for such a machine, then 2-in-1 laptops are your best bet. Convertibles make such versatile machines because you can swing the screen around 360 degrees. Read on to check out our picks below.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hp-pavilion-x360-2-in-1-laptop-14t-ek1000-14-742j3av-1&amp;xcust=2-1-2018848-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">HP Pavilion x360</a>, Intel Core i3-1315U CPU/UHD graphics/8GB RAM/256GB SSD/14-inch 1080p touch display, <strong>$479.99 ($220 off at HP)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hp-spectre-x360-16-2-in-1-laptop-16t-f2000-74r53av-1&amp;xcust=2-1-2018848-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">HP Spectre x360</a>, Intel Core i7-13700H CPU/Intel Iris Xe graphics/16GB RAM/512GB SSD/16-inch 1920p touch display, <strong>$1,099.99 ($600 off at HP)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re in the market for a convertible laptop with a really nice display, we&rsquo;d recommend picking up the HP Spectre x360, which you can find in the bulleted list above. According to HP,  the touch display has a maximum brightness of 400 nits and a sharp resolution of 3072&times;1920, which is impressive given the price and hardware. This machine also comes with an HP Rechargeable MPP2.0 Tilt Pen, which means you don&rsquo;t have to worry about the extra cost. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"back-to-school-content-creation-laptop-deals\">Back to school content creation laptop deals</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re studying to become a photo editor or graphic designer, you&rsquo;ll need a powerful laptop with a good screen and plenty of storage. For content creation laptops, we always recommend ones with discrete graphics, which is important for editing (trust me you definitely want more oomph in the graphics department). To help narrow things down for you, we found a great deal on a laptop with a beastly RTX 4070 GPU inside.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/omen-by-hp-laptop-17-cm2047nr&amp;xcust=2-1-2018848-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">HP Omen Laptop 17</a>, Intel Core i7-13700HX CPU/Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 GPU/16GB RAM/1TB SSD/17.3-inch 1440p display, <strong>$,1,549.99 ($400 at HP)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, if you want to get technical, the HP Omen Laptop 17 is a straight-up gaming rig. However, given the powerful components inside, it&rsquo;s actually perfect for content creation. The RTX 4070 GPU is more than capable of handling photo or video editing tasks as well as running modern titles on the High or Ultra graphics preset. The display is also quite spacious at 17.3-inches, which is important for getting those minute details just right.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-block faq-block\"><h2 class=\"faq-block-title\" id=\"faq\"> FAQ </h2><hr class=\"block-horizotal-divider\" />\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">1.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"when-does-the-hp-back-to-school-sale-begin\">When does the HP back-to-school sale begin?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>The HP back-to-school sale has been going since July, but you&rsquo;ll start seeing quite a few steeper discounts from August onward. In some cases, you can save up to 67 percent on specific devices and products. You can even earn an additional 20 percent off on HyperX and Poly accessories when you buy them with a PC or monitor.

That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;d recommend hopping on this bandwagon sooner rather than later, as the end of August will be here before you know it. Whether you&rsquo;re a teacher or a student, it helps to be as prepared as possible before the school year begins.

When it comes to Windows machines and Chromebooks and which one is better than the other, it really just boils down to personal preference and lifestyle. Some (like me) prefer the Chrome ecosystem, where everything is in one place in the cloud. That said, if you need something more powerful for gaming or content creation, or need the ability to install traditional desktop programs, you should probably spring for a Windows machine. </p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n\nLaptops</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2018848/2018848.html", "date_published": "2023-08-04T15:07:49+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "12 back-to-school gadgets you didn\u2019t know you needed", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Some tech purchases are no-brainers when getting ready for a fresh school year, like <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/818199/back-to-school-deals.html\">buying a new laptop or Chromebook</a>.

You want your laptop screen at a height that prevents hunching or bad posture, especially if you often have long study and homework sessions. It also makes a dual-screen setup with a separate monitor less awkward. The great thing is that <a href=\"http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=14154&amp;GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/s?k=laptop+stand&amp;crid=3VBISLOEU3AGJ&amp;sprefix=laptop+sta%2Caps%2C287&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2&amp;ascsubtag=2-1-2008219-1-0-0\" rel=\"nofollow\">laptop stands aren&rsquo;t expensive</a>, and you can even pick up <a href=\"http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=14154&amp;GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Adjustable-Silicone-Foldable-Ventilated-Tablet-Black/dp/B08G84P8ZX/?ascsubtag=2-1-2008219-1-0-0\" rel=\"nofollow\">an ultra compact one</a> that travels well.

That kind of growth potential has investors salivating and engineers scrambling for hardware. Unfortunately, it looks like consumer-grade GPUs are a great way to boost your processing power for AI computations&hellip;just like they were for crunching numbers for cryptocurrency. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that sounds familiar, it&rsquo;s because the crypto boom in the late 2010s and the start of the pandemic in 2020 <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394292/a-perfect-storm-why-graphics-cards-cost-so-much-now.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">created an absolute nightmare</a> for anyone who wanted to buy a GPU. Graphics card street prices ballooned to double or even triple their retail value, with scalpers and buyer bots making it all but impossible for regular old PC gamers to get a new card. Fortunately that&rsquo;s died down and GPU prices have normalized, but plenty of PC gamers are still smarting from the bad times, like Dust Bowl migrants hanging on to their trauma. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new boom in AI is causing big investments in companies like Nvidia, which <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1935564/nvidia-passes-1-trillion-market-cap-as-investors-fall-in-love-with-ai.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">recently had its best quarter <em>ever</em></a><em> </em>largely on strong sales to AI firms.

However, optimizing them required installing the optional polarizing filter for day use, and removing it for night use. This is a pain, and not something the average user will want to do. I&rsquo;d opt for leaving it on, as the benefits during the day outweigh the slight reduction in brightness at night.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that the time shown in these captures is off. The camera managed to grab the correct date, but didn&rsquo;t select the correct time zone. Why it can&rsquo;t set the time according to GPS info is unknown. Viofo should fix that.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2007711\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Viofo-A119-Mini-24.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">With the polarizing filter on, the A119 Mini 2 handles bright conditions very well.

It shows good color and detail as well as a decent handling of headlight flare.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, the A119 Mini 2&rsquo;s captures are excellent in terms of color, handling headlight flare, and overall view-ability. I&rsquo;d opt for a bit sharper detail, but that&rsquo;s being picky.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"should-you-buy-the-viofo-a119-mini-2\">Should you buy the Viofo A119 Mini 2?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I enjoyed my time with the A119 Mini 2.

Specifically, the dialogue window says &ldquo;Outlook closed while you had items open. Reopen items from last session?&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether Outlook is closed by a crash, a system update or manually, it doesn&rsquo;t matter: Outlook asks at every restart whether old windows should be restored. Clicking &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; restores draft e-mails and opens all e-mail windows or appointments that were open during the last session.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many users, the setting responsible for whether you should see those prompts cannot be found in the Outlook options, even though a selection should appear that lets you choose whether Outlook should restore previous contents. If that&rsquo;s the case for you, the annoying prompt can&rsquo;t be permanently deactivated in the program. The responsible feature was introduced with Outlook for Windows on Beta Channel Version 2006 (Build 13006.20002) a good three years ago. Now, however, it&rsquo;s causing problems because it&rsquo;s activated by default.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"temporary-workaround\">Temporary workaround</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The team behind Outlook is still looking for the cause of this annoying behavior. Until a final solution is found, however, Microsoft is offering a temporary fix that disables recovery and thus bypasses the constant prompting. Open the Windows registry editor (Regedit) and navigate to &ldquo;HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Outlook\\Preferences&rdquo;. There, right-click, hover over &ldquo;New,&rdquo; and create a new DWORD value called &ldquo;ReopenWindowsOption&rdquo;. Give it the value &ldquo;1&rdquo;. Boom!. After closing Regedit and reopening Outlook, the annoying prompt should no longer appear.</p>\n\nPersonal Software, Professional Software, Windows</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2020344/microsoft-solution-for-annoying-outlook-problem.html", "date_published": "2023-08-04T13:50:13+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "9 essential back-to-school laptop accessories for under $100", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you&rsquo;ve got your college kid a brand new laptop, and they&rsquo;re all set to conquer the academic world.

In terms of rasterization performance, the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1431755/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-radeon-rx-7900-xt-review-rdna-3.html\">Radeon RX 7900 XTX</a> &mdash; currently AMD&rsquo;s fastest GPU &mdash; is already beaten by around 25 percent in 4K resolution. When ray tracing is activated, the lead increases to over 60 percent, and in some games, the RTX 4090 is even twice as fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&rsquo;t forget the topic of efficiency, because Nvidia&rsquo;s GPU is clearly ahead of the competition here as well. You also pay a premium price for the RTX 4090, but in return you get the <strong>best graphics card the market currently has to offer</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"power-efficiency-matters-especially-now\">Power efficiency matters, especially now</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When comparing two graphics cards with roughly the same performance, price is often the deciding factor. What is often not taken into account, however, is how the efficiency of the products affects the price over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s a very simple calculation: In addition to the purchase price, you pay for the electricity your graphics card consumes every year. If a card is a little more expensive to buy, but works much more efficiently, you can compensate for the higher initial costs after a few years and end up saving money. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"GPU Preis mit Folgekosten f&uuml;r Bestandskunden - 2160p\" class=\"wp-image-2008105\" height=\"823\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/GPU-Preis-mit-Folgekosten-fur-Bestandskunden-in-2160p-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The cheaper graphics card is not necessarily the better choice if it consumes significantly more electricity for the same performance.

So if you don&rsquo;t place much value on ray tracing, the AMD card is the better choice, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not necessarily, because the RTX 4070 consumes almost 100 watts less when gaming. Depending on your electricity prices and how much you play every day or use the card to its full capacity, you will make up the $100 surcharge in about two years. As you can see, the purchase price is only one aspect of the cost calculation, especially if you live in Europe. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"cta wp-block wp-block-button\"><a class=\"cta__btn\" href=\"http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=14154&amp;GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/MSI-GeForce-RTX-4070-12G/dp/B0BZB7DS7Q?ascsubtag=2-1-2017022-7-0-0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">MSI GeForce RTX 4070 Ventus at Amazon</a></p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading toc\" id=\"nvidia-is-the-innovation-driver\">Nvidia is the innovation driver</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>DLSS, ray tracing, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/393646/tested-how-nvidia-reflex-can-make-you-a-better-esports-gamer.html\">Nvidia Reflex</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/423202/g-sync-vs-freesync-amd-nvidia-monitor.html\">G-Sync</a>: these are just a few of the Nvidia-driven innovations that shook up the PC gaming world in recent years. <strong>Team Green sets the trends and the competition follows suit</strong>, without (at least so far) being able to achieve the same quality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not to say that <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/919457/amd-fsr-1-0-vs-fsr-2-0.html\">AMD&rsquo;s FSR</a> or <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1341464/intel-arc-a770-a750-graphics-card-xe-hpg-review.html\">Intel&rsquo;s XeSS</a> upscaling technologies, for example, cannot also deliver impressive results.

Since I play in 1440p and with high settings, this requires a lot of ray tracing power and high-performance AI upscaling &mdash; both points in which Nvidia is currently ahead. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This does not have to remain so. AMD will continue to work hard to catch up. And AMD&rsquo;s technologies also have some arguments in their favor, as my colleague <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1997360/4-reasons-why-i-switched-from-nvidia-to-amd.html\">very rightly explains in his article</a>. But the lead that Nvidia currently still enjoys convinced me to make the switch to Team Green. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading toc\" id=\"creative-users-are-better-off-with-nvidia\">Creative users are better off with Nvidia</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>CG Director, a hardware website with a special focus on creative applications, has <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.cgdirector.com/nvidia-geforce-vs-amd-radeon-gpus/&amp;xcust=2-1-2017022-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">compiled a list of twelve graphics cards</a> that are best suited for creative work, taking both small and large budgets into account. The list is no longer completely up-to-date, but the fact that only Nvidia GPUs are on the list shows Nvidia&rsquo;s position in the creative scene. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>An important factor here is CUDA, a software interface developed by Nvidia in which the graphics card can support the CPU as a co-processor. The highly specialized chip can thus perform all kinds of calculations. Processes that can be run in parallel, i.e. do not have to be processed sequentially, can be processed much faster than with a CPU. AMD, on the other hand, relies on the open source OpenCL, which often does not deliver the same performance as CUDA and is more difficult for developers to implement.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Premiere Pro - GPU\" class=\"wp-image-1924332\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Adobe-Premiere-Pro.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">In our benchmarks for creative applications, AMD hardly gives the competition a chance.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Sebastian Schenzinger</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>CUDA is a proprietary interface, developed by and only compatible with Nvidia GPUs. Since many creative applications use the CUDA interface, graphics cards from other manufacturers often suffer from poorer performance or are even not supported at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the introduction of the RT cores on the RTX GPUs, Nvidia has another ace up its sleeve: Optix. Optix is also a prorietary framework from Nvidia, which aims to accelerate the calculation of ray tracing. And ray tracing is not only used to make games look more realistic, but can also significantly speed up creative applications, a vivid example of which is the open-source 3D renderer Blender.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nvidia&rsquo;s NVENC, a technology for faster encoding of videos, is also indispensable for many creative pros. Nvidia even provides different drivers for gamers and creatives: the Game Ready drivers and the Studio drivers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I bought my last graphics card, creative applications were hardly an issue for me. However, that has changed in the past few years and applications like Adobe&rsquo;s Premiere Pro and After Effects are part of my daily tools.

You&rsquo;ll also find an HDMI output port in most consumer desktop and laptop computers, as well as an <em>input</em> port on many all-in-one PCs, to enable a gaming console or a set-top box for use with the internal display.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given HDMI&rsquo;s ubiquity, you might have forgotten about the <em>other</em> digital audio/video standard: DisplayPort. Though you&rsquo;ll find it alongside HDMI on most discrete graphics cards, Macs, and business laptops, it&rsquo;s less common in consumer PCs. It&rsquo;s also rare as hen&rsquo;s teeth in consumer electronics devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both HDMI and DisplayPort can deliver high-definition digital video and high-resolution audio from a source device to a display, so you might be wondering: What&rsquo;s the difference? Why might you want DisplayPort when HDMI is so common? And how do USB Type-C port fit into the picture?  We&rsquo;ll answer those questions and more, but first, the tale of how the two standards came to be, and which entities control them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"hdmi-and-displayport-origins\">HDMI and DisplayPort origins</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The HDMI (High Definition Multimedia Interface) specification was conceived in 2002 by six consumer electronics giants: Hitachi, Panasonic, Philips, Silicon Image, Sony, and Toshiba. Today, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://www.hdmi.org/&amp;xcust=2-1-457147-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">HDMI Licensing, LLC</a>, a wholly owned subsidiary of Silicon Image, controls the spec, but some 80-odd vendors are members of the HDMI Forum. Member or not, manufacturers must pay a royalty for including HDMI in their products. They of course pass that cost along to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.displayport.org&amp;xcust=2-1-457147-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">DisplayPort</a> specification was developed by (and remains under the control of) the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA), a large consortium of manufacturers ranging from AMD to ZIPS Corporation&mdash;nearly all of which <em>also</em> belong to the HDMI Forum. You&rsquo;ve likely heard the name VESA in relationship to video before. Most TV manufacturers, for instance, adhere to the organization&rsquo;s wall-mount standard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DisplayPort debuted in 2006 as part of an effort to replace two older standards used primarily for computer displays: VGA (Video Graphics Array, an analog interface first introduced in 1987) and DVI (Digital Video Interface, introduced in 1999). DisplayPort is a royalty-free product, but HDMI&rsquo;s four-year head start was tough competition. It made the most inroads with PCs, which have shorter technology cycles and often greater display needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Fun fact: Of the six companies responsible for the creation of HDMI, only Hitachi and Philips are not also member companies of VESA.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"cta wp-block wp-block-button\"><a class=\"cta__btn\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-HDMI-Cables/zgbs/electronics/202505011&amp;xcust=2-1-457147-7-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">View HDMI cables on Amazon</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"cta wp-block wp-block-button\"><a class=\"cta__btn\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/displayport-cable/s?k=displayport+cable&amp;xcust=2-1-457147-7-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">View DisplayPort cables on Amazon</a></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"hdmi-and-displayport-capabilities\">HDMI and DisplayPort capabilities</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>HDMI, recently revised to version 2.1a, is capable of supporting bit rates up to <a href=\"https://www.techhive.com/article/3239084/hdmi-21-has-arrived-heres-everything-you-need-to-know.html\">48Gbps</a>. VESA even more recently announced <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.displayport.org/pr/vesa-publishes-displayport-2-0-video-standard-enabling-support-for-beyond-8k-resolutions-higher-refresh-rates-for-4k-hdr-and-virtual-reality-applications/&amp;xcust=2-1-457147-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">DisplayPort 2.1</a>, which can handle raw throughput up to 80Gbps. However, DisplayPort 2.1 isn&rsquo;t supported by many devices currently, and HDMI 2.1a, which makes some of its features optional, is still being adopted. Not that it matters too significantly&mdash;DisplayPort 2.1 is more of a <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1355415/displayport-2-1-announced-for-pcs.html\">tightening up of the 2.0 spec</a>, and HDMI 2.1a only adds improved support for high-dynamic range displays. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a class=\"zoom\" href=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/10/bandwidth2-01-100814005-orig.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"bandwidth2 01\" src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/10/bandwidth2-01-100814005-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"> <p>HDMI 2.1 and 2.1a allow higher-resolution video and audio than previous versions.</p> </figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see from the images above and below, HDMI and DisplayPort both have widened their pipes tremendously over the years.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a class=\"zoom\" href=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/11/vesa_displayport_2.0_chart-100816523-orig.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"vesa displayport 2.0 chart\" src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/11/vesa_displayport_2.0_chart-100816523-medium.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"> <p>DisplayPort&rsquo;s bandwidth has increased significantly over the year<span>s. Version 2.1 keeps version 2.0&rsquo;s maximum bandwidth but tightens up the spec while adding a few more features.</span></p></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>HDMI and DisplayPort are similar when it comes to practical applications, and the industry largely views them as complimentary standards. Indeed, HDMI 2.1a offers VESA&rsquo;s Display Stream Compression. DisplayPort&rsquo;s raw specs are certainly more impressive, but HDMI&rsquo;s capabilities have always been more than adequate for the mainstream A/V market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that both standards can drive older display types, both via adapters and adapter cables: HDMI to VGA and DVI; and DisplayPort to VGA, DVI, and HDMI. Both standards are also backward compatible, falling back to the oldest revision used in a connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a chart showing major features and specs for each standard. You can right-click and open the image a new tab to expand to a readable size.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"HDMI &amp; DisplayPort features\" class=\"wp-image-2017866\" height=\"328\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/features-100817366-orig.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><strong>Definitions:&nbsp;</strong>bpp is bits per pixel. 24bpp/3 subpixels = 8-bit color; 30bpp/3 = 10-bit color. 4:4:4 means full color and luminance data is being delivered. 60Hz and 60fps are equivalent. HDMI supports a second video stream, which can be used for a second display or for picture-in-picture/picture-by-picture, but it&rsquo;s rarely implemented. The DisplayPort cable spec allows for power transmission on pin 20, but these days, only Thunderbolt 1 and 2 support power carriage.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>HDMI and DisplayPort do the same things, but in very different ways, and there are features unique to each. HDMI explicitly supports CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) for controlling entire A/V setups, and an HDMI cable can carry ethernet information. Ethernet requires a purpose-built cable as described in Cables section below. DisplayPort supports CEC over an auxiliary channel, but it&rsquo;s rarely if ever implemented, due simply to DisplayPort&rsquo;s faint footprint in the consumer electronics world.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"using-multiple-displays-on-hdmi-and-displayport\">Using multiple displays on HDMI and DisplayPort</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Probably the biggest practical difference between the two standards is that DisplayPort can drive four daisy-chained displays and HDMI can drive just two, with implementations of the latter being extremely scarce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that the 48Gbps per second and the 80Gbps quoted above are the raw HDMI 2.1a and DisplayPort delivery speeds respectively. DisplayPort 2.1 has four lanes that can deliver approximately 77.37Gbps (19.34Gbps per lane) of actual data, while DisplayPort 1.4a can deliver 32.4Gbps (6.48Gbps per lane). HDMI 2.0 delivers 14.4Gbps, and the older HDMI 2.1 offers 42.6Gbps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To determine if a resolution will work, use the following calculation and compare it to the available bandwidth: <em>Horizontal resolution * vertical resolution * bits per pixel (i.e., color depth) * frames per second</em>. For example: 3840 * 2160 (4K UHD resolution) * 24bpp (8-bit color depth) * 60fps (refresh rate).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Divide the standard&rsquo;s total data rate by your result to see how many displays you can use at that resolution with DisplayPort. There&rsquo;s a handy calculator at <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://k.kramerav.com/support/bwcalculator.asp&amp;xcust=2-1-457147-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">KV Audio</a>, although it misidentifies bits per cell (sub-pixel) as bits per pixel in the color depth field. (8bpc = 24bpp, etc.). Just to give you an idea, DisplayPort 1.4a and 2.1 can drive four daisychained 4K UHD displays with 8-bit color depth and a 60Hz refresh rate. You&rsquo;ll need the newer standard for 10-bit (30bpp) color&mdash;or use <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://vesa.org/vesa-display-compression-codecs/dsc/&amp;xcust=2-1-457147-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">DSC (Display Stream Compression)</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, use the chart from the HDMI Forum showing resolutions and their approximate bandwidth. These correlate roughly to DisplayPort.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a class=\"zoom\" href=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/02/formatdataratetable-100750471-orig.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"formatdataratetable\" src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/02/formatdataratetable-100750471-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">\n<p>This chart is for HDMI, but the bandwidths also translate to DisplayPort.</p>\n</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"hdr-support-on-hdmi-and-displayport\">HDR Support on HDMI and DisplayPort</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Both standards support HDR (High Dynamic Range), with its wider brightness and color gamuts, but HDMI 2.0x only supports static metadata (HDR10), while HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 1.4a/2.1 both support dynamic metadata (HDR10+, etc).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Static metadata means TV adjustment-for-content data is sent once at that start of a video. Dynamic metadata means adjustment data is sent throughout the video and allows finer adjustments. Dolby Vision is embedded into the older stream protocols and will work with any recent version of both standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"audio-transmission-on-hdmi-and-displayport\">Audio transmission on HDMI and DisplayPort</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>HDMI and DisplayPort handle 192Hz/24-bit audio, but with HDMI, that&rsquo;s only over a single cable connection. That&rsquo;s fine for high-resolution audio buffs with an HD audio player and an A/V receiver. But to pass audio from a TV tuner or pass it through from a device attached to the TV to an A/V receiver, HDMI 1.4 and 2.0 use ARC (Audio Return Channel), which is limited to two channels of 44.1Hz/16-bit uncompressed audio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ARC supports highly compressed 5.1 surround, but uncompressed 5.1 and 7.1 audio, as well as sample rates up to 192kHz/24-bit are now possible via HDMI 2.1&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.techhive.com/article/3445045/hdmi-arc-and-hdmi-earc-explained.html\">eARC (enhanced ARC) standard</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DisplayPort 1.4 and greater has no such issues and can pass uncompressed 7.1, 192Hz/24-bit audio audio to as many as four displays should you ever have the need for such a setup. Previous versions supported this on only a single display or receiver.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"hdmi-connectors\">HDMI connectors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>HDMI connectors have 19 pins and are most commonly seen in three sizes: Type A (standard), Type C (mini), and Type D (micro). Of these, Type A is what you&rsquo;ll find on TVs, Blu-ray players, soundbars, and other large A/V components; Type C is often found on smaller devices, such as dash cams; and you&rsquo;ll typically encounter Type D on phones and tablets. A fourth category of HDMI connector, Type E, is used for automotive applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most HDMI connectors rely on friction to stay in place, although some vendors have developed proprietary locking mechanisms designed to prevent the cable from pulling loose.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/03/hdmi_plugs-100028824-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The three types of HDMI connectors you&rsquo;re most likely to encounter are (from left to right) standard, mini, and micro. A fourth connector type, for automotive applications, is not shown here.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"displayport-connectors\">DisplayPort connectors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>DisplayPort connectors have 20 pins and are available in two sizes: DisplayPort and Mini DisplayPort (the latter is the port of choice for Microsoft&rsquo;s Surface Pro tablet, as well as Macs prior to Apple&rsquo;s adoption of USB Type-C/Thunderbolt 3). <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_9?url=search-alias%3Delectronics-accessories&amp;field-keywords=displayport+cable&amp;sprefix=displaypo%2Celectronics-accessories%2C204&amp;crid=L795MMVBO7G2&amp;rh=i%3Aelectronics-accessories%2Ck%3Adisplayport+cable&amp;xcust=2-1-457147-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Find one on Amazon</a>.

Hence, HDMI signals can also be run over CAT5 or CAT6 cable (with a maximum resolution of 1080p), or over fiber-optic cable, according to HDMI Licensing LLC. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=node%3D202505011&amp;field-keywords=active+hdmi+type+a+cable&amp;rh=n%3A172282%2Cn%3A281407%2Cn%3A172532%2Cn%3A172540%2Cn%3A464418%2Cn%3A202505011%2Ck%3Aactive+hdmi+type+a+cable&amp;xcust=2-1-457147-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Active cables</a> with signal-booster circuitry, meanwhile, can be longer and thinner (up to 130 feet, compared to 65 feet for passive cables). Thinner cables are less likely to fail when forced to make hard bends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s all great, but it does muddy the waters a bit for users as to which cables will work with which devices. There is a <a href=\"https://www.techhive.com/article/2988931/a-new-hdmi-certification-program-will-make-it-easier-to-avoid-crappy-cables.html\">testing and certification program</a> if you want a logo, but an overbuilt cable from the early days will quite likely work with the more recent standards; i.e., higher resolutions and color depths.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are currently three bandwidth standards and logos you might see, with a variant of each that re-tasks two wires to carry ethernet. That&rsquo;s including the new Ultra cables from the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/3239026/components-graphics/hdmi-21-spec-10k-resolution-dynamic-hdr.html\">HDMI 2.1 spec</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong> Standard HDMI Cable:</strong> Provides sufficient bandwidth for only 720p and 1080i resolution video. The ethernet variant can carry 100Mbps.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong> High Speed HDMI Cable:</strong> These are good for up to 2160p (4K or 4K UHD), but only at a 24Hz refresh rate. Again, the ethernet variant carries 100Mbps.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong> Ultra High Speed HDMI Cable:</strong> These cables are capable of carrying HDMI 2.1a&rsquo;s full 48Gbps, which is good for 8K, 8K UHD, as well as flavors of 10K if the video is compressed.

However, it caused issues and was dropped from cables if not the connectors. That&rsquo;s the reason there are both Thunderbolt and DisplayPort cables, rather than one type. Older non-certified DisplayPort cables might have pin 20 connected. Be careful with them, or sell them to someone with a Thunderbolt setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As to cable lengths, the shortest you can get away with is the best. Active will be required for very long runs, but what you&rsquo;ll find for sale at this point in development is a good indication of what&rsquo;s possible. Again, the story with the latest standards has yet to be written, so after trying your old cables, buy one with the appropriate logo.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"is-usb-c-the-future\">Is USB-C the future?</h2>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"the-best-budget-usb-c-monitor\">\n\t\t\t\t\tthe best budget usb-c monitor\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"nzxt-canvas-27q\">NZXT Canvas 27Q</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"NZXT Canvas 27Q\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/nzxt-canvas-27q-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1500\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review product-widget__review-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__rating-and-review-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__review-details--rating\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/828353/nzxt-canvas-27q-monitor-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__pricing-details  \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://nzxt.com/product/canvas-27q&amp;xcust=2-1-457147-5-828357-14418&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$249.99 at  NZXT</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>When USB 3.1 showed up, a corollary standard for a new, updated connector was also introduced: USB Type-C, or USB-C (as it&rsquo;s been officially dubbed by the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.usb.org/about&amp;xcust=2-1-457147-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">USB Implementers Forum</a>).

If you&rsquo;re talking TVs, A/V receivers, and the like, as well as budget computing, HDMI is what you&rsquo;re going get 99.9 percent of the time, and it&rsquo;s more than adequate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, if you&rsquo;re looking to create a robust monitor setup (i.e., use of a high-resolution display with a high-refresh rate), you&rsquo;re talking DisplayPort. That generally requires a discrete graphics card, but with the growing acceptance of USB Type-C ports as a standard, hopefully DisplayPort will become significantly more widespread in all sectors of the market.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"cta wp-block wp-block-button\"><a class=\"cta__btn\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-HDMI-Cables/zgbs/electronics/202505011&amp;xcust=2-1-457147-7-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">View HDMI cables on Amazon</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"cta wp-block wp-block-button\"><a class=\"cta__btn\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/displayport-cable/s?k=displayport+cable&amp;xcust=2-1-457147-7-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">View DisplayPort cables on Amazon</a></p>\nHDTVs, Laptop Accessories, Laptops, Monitors, Technology Industry</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/457147/hdmi-vs-displayport-which-display-interface-reigns-supreme.html", "date_published": "2023-08-04T10:30:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "These award-winning translation earbuds are now just $100", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>When you&rsquo;re a citizen of the world, you want to be able to speak with as many people as possible.
