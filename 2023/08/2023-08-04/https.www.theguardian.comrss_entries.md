In 2020, Donald Trump was ready to bring down the American republic rather than admit before the shade of his dead father that he had lost a presidential election. Scholars speak of “<a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/32905">losers’ consent</a>” as an essential prerequisite of a democratic system: without it, there can be no peaceful transfer of power.

The Argentinian is in a hurry, a man whose time at Paris Saint-Germain has taught him never to take anything for granted, and he is not in a mood to make excuses. The aim is to hit the ground running, even though another summer of change at Stamford Bridge has left Chelsea with a squad packed with unproven young talent, and the main focus for Pochettino is making sure his new side are ready for Liverpool next weekend.</p><p>“We are building something special,” Chelsea’s head coach says, acknowledging that the club’s recruitment team are in the middle of a major rebuild after the shock of last season’s underperformance. “It’s a process and we need time. But in football you cannot ask for time and you need to deliver now. We are Chelsea and, even if we have young players involved against Liverpool, the mentality is to win.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/04/mauricio-pochettino-we-are-building-something-special-at-chelsea">Continue reading...</a>

<p>TV’s best-read teen shows off plenty of books this season – from Austen and Camus to Wilde and Tilly Walden – illuminating many of the show’s themes</p><p></p><p>The highly anticipated second season of the tender teen queer drama Heartstopper has finally landed on our screens, and with it comes a whole new reading list for observant viewers. As Heartstopper fans will know, the character Isaac (played by Tobie Donovan) is rarely seen without a book. His reading choices in season one ranged from Pride and Prejudice to There Is No Planet B by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/mike-berners-lee">Mike Berners-Lee</a>. In season two, the quietly confident bookworm exhibits a collection just as eclectic as the last. And these titles are not just an insight into the character’s literary tastes: each one has a wider relevance to the show’s plot.</p><p>Grappling with a fluid identity is a thread running through this season, so Isaac sets the tone with fiction such as <strong>I Love This Part</strong> by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/19/tillie-walden-art-of-skating-spinning-comics">Tillie Walden</a> and <strong>Ace of Spades</strong> by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/08/faridah-abike-iyimide-british-student-million-dollar-book-deal-ace-of-spades">Faridah Àbíké-Íyímídé</a>. Walden’s graphic novel about two pre-teen girls falling in love and Àbíké-Íyímídé’s queer whodunnit set in a high school have clear links to Heartstopper’s central boy-meets-boy storyline. Ace of Spades is also a favourite with BookTokers, as is another novel Isaac reads this season, <strong>Book Lovers</strong> by Emily Henry – a nod, perhaps, to Heartstopper’s large TikTok fanbase.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/04/heartstopper-isaac-reading-list">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The 19-year-old who did it has now spent half his life in prison. Executing him won’t make me feel any better</p><p>In the summer of 1987, I recall giving a persuasive speech in the public speaking class I was taking at LSU-Shreveport. It was on why we should abolish the death penalty. At that time, this was an abstract argument to me. I never expected that I would ever be confronted with the realities of the death penalty. That was something, I thought, that only happened to others.</p><p>Then, in December of 2000, that reality paid me and my family a visit.<br /><br />My mother, Mary Ann Shaver Malone, was abducted from her home in Plain Dealing, Louisiana, a week before Christmas by the young man who had done her yardwork for years – purportedly to get money for gambling debts and a ride to a nearby town. She subsequently died as a result of the events of that evening. My family’s loss and grief were unfathomable. After our initial shock and horror subsided, our emotions ranged from anger to rage to despair and profound sadness.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sukCHngwkLI">Brett Malone</a> is a death penalty abolitionist and advocate for reparative justice</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/04/an-inmate-on-death-row-killed-my-mother-i-dont-want-him-to-die">Continue reading...</a>

## Oyster festival’s shell recycling to help last native bed in Scotland

<p>Organisers of Stranraer oyster festival say shell of every eaten mollusc will be returned to bed in Loch Ryan</p><p>Organisers of next month’s Stranraer oyster festival have promised to recycle the shell of every mollusc consumed at the three-day event to help grow the last remaining wild, native oyster bed in Scotland.</p><p>With about 12,000 oysters consumed last year, the circular collection scheme will ensure that this year’s shells are returned to the protected bed on the shores of Loch Ryan, a few miles north of Stranraer. This reduces waste from the festival and also creates valuable shell habitat for young oysters. The native variety, <em>Ostrea edulis</em>, has been almost wiped out in UK waters by overfishing and seabed trawling.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/04/oyster-festivals-shell-recycling-to-help-last-native-bed-in-scotland">Continue reading...</a>

<p>These silky-sweet pots with one of summer’s finest stone fruits may well become your new guilty pleasure</p><p>White chocolate isn’t typically my first choice, but there are a few exceptions, one of them being a Milkybar yoghurt or, as it’s probably labelled now, pudding. When I was younger, I would always request them, scraping the container clean to ensure I got every last bit. For this nostalgic recipe, I contemplated creating a mousse, incorporating gelatine and other complex techniques, but ultimately decided on a lighter ganache, which required fewer ingredients and was simpler to prepare. The outcome is a concentrated silk-like white chocolate that will tempt you to have more than just one.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/aug/04/white-chocolate-pots-roast-nectarines-recipe-ravneet-gill">Continue reading...</a>

And because death is universal, Dasso thinks the story will be of interest to everyone. “As far as I know, nobody’s immortal,” he laughs.</p><p>Not that he wants to put a downer on things. “Often stories or games about death can kind of be morbid, [and] we really didn’t want that for this game,” he says. “[Kirby creator Masahiro] Sakurai says that no matter what, a game should be entertaining first.” And so it is with Hauntii, which sees your friendly ghost meeting a cavalcade of curious and often funny entities as they travel through the afterlife.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/aug/04/hauntii-a-game-about-death-possession-and-navigating-eternity">Continue reading...</a>

## The growing appeal of field blends | Fiona Beckett on drinks

<p>‘Field blend’ – a new term for an old winemaking method combining different grape varieties in a single plot – brings a lively freshness to a bottle</p><p>Back when I was wondering which wines would be on trend in 2023, I have to confess I didn’t see field blends being among them. I’ve been into them for a while, but this summer they suddenly seem to have slipped into the mainstream. They’ve even popped up in a couple of supermarket ranges (as well as in the somewhat less impressive <a href="https://www.coop.co.uk/products/banrock-station-wild-lands-white-blend-75cl">Banrock Station Wild Lands</a> line at the Co-op).</p><p>But what is a field blend, and how does it differ from any other blend? Well, the strict definition is that it denotes a wine made from a vineyard where different varieties of grape are planted randomly, rather than in blocks of a single one. It’s the way things used to be done, and operates much like a wildflower meadow. You can see the romance in that – though winemakers these days are more likely to know exactly what they’re picking, so the term is also used to cover grapes that are harvested and co-fermented at the same time, which results in some being underripe and others riper, and often brings a lively freshness to the wine (field blends are rarely high in alcohol, either). Blends, by contrast, are made mainly from grapes that are picked and vinified separately, which makes for more uniformity but less of an unpredictable thrill.</p><p>For more by Fiona Beckett, go to <a href="https://fionabeckett.substack.com/">fionabeckett.substack.com</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/aug/04/growing-appeal-of-field-blend-wines-fiona-beckett">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Elena Kagan told judicial conference that supreme court should be subject to checks and balance</p><p>Good morning, US politics blog readers. <strong>Donald Trump</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/03/trump-arraignment-indictment-jan-6-2020-election">came and went from Washington DC yesterday</a> after pleading not guilty to charges related to trying to overturn the election, but the legacy of his presidency can be found all across the capital, particularly at the supreme court. He decisively shifted its ideological makeup to the right by appointing three conservative justices to the bench, and in the years since, they’ve handed down decisions with major implications for American life, including by overturning Roe v Wade last year and allowing states to fully ban abortion.</p><p>But <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/jul/12/us-supreme-court-justices-ethics-rules-controversy-explain">a series of media reports</a> this year have revealed questionable ties between some of the justices and people with interests in their decisions. Senate Democrats are now trying to pass legislation that would require the justices to adopt a code of ethics, and that, too, appears to have been caught up in the court’s ideological split. Last week, conservative justice <strong>Samuel Alito</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/jul/30/senate-ethics-rules-supreme-court">said in an interview</a> that Congress has no authority to impose such rules on the court. But at an event yesterday, liberal justice <strong>Elena Kagan</strong> indicated that <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/03/kagan-enters-fray-over-congress-power-to-police-supreme-court-00109770?nname=playbook&amp;nid=0000014f-1646-d88f-a1cf-5f46b7bd0000&amp;nrid=12069c7e-e346-405c-ad2c-71cb1a62e514&amp;nlid=630318">she believed lawmakers</a> did indeed have that power.</p><p>“Can Congress do various things to regulate the Supreme Court? I think the answer is: yes.”</p><p><strong>Employment data</strong> released just now indicates the US labor market remains strong, which is good news for both <strong>Joe Biden</strong> and the Federal Reserve’s campaign to curb inflation.

## Prom 26: BBCPhil/Storgårds review – Barry takes us inside Kafka’s head

<p><strong>Royal Albert Hall, London<br /></strong>Gerald Barry’s deliberately muted new work, Kafka’s Earplugs, failed to make an impact in this venue, while James Ehnes was a deft and impressive soloist in Walton’s violin concerto</p><p>The writer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/franzkafka">Franz Kafka</a> found sounds from the outside world, whether urban or rural, intolerable, and wore earplugs to insulate himself as far as possible from their intrusions. When the first world war began, his major concern was that his supply of earplugs from Berlin might be disrupted by the upheaval. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/gerald-barry">Gerald Barry</a>’s new orchestral piece, Kafka’s Earplugs – a BBC commission whose world premiere opened the BBC Philharmonic’s concert with its chief conductor, <a href="https://www.johnstorgards.com/">John Storgårds</a> – took us inside Kafka’s head. “You are Kafka,” the composer says, “hearing the world’s sounds as he heard them through his earplugs.”</p><p>That sound world is consistently quiet, from the grinding brass and string chords with which the piece opens, to the insistent pulsing into which it eventually settles, before a sudden, almost arbitrary close. Barry also makes the point that Kafka “laughed a lot”, but there are few traces of that humour in this 10-minute piece, which holds the world and its distractions very much at muted arm’s length. Whether the result in performance was what he was after only the composer can say, but, in the hall at least, the music certainly sounded distinctly louder than the pianissimo that is the only dynamic marking in the score.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/04/prom-26-bbc-philharmonic-storgards-ehnes-review-gerald-barry-kafkas-earplugs">Continue reading...</a>

Red Skull wearing the gruesome armour of a long since demised Captain America; the defeated bodies of most of the X-Men; Ant-Man in Giant-Man mode sprawled out dead against an icy hellscape. It is an alternate version of comic-book reality in which there is a major superhero cull, and Marvel’s supervillains finally take eternal control of the Earth.</p><p>Something similar took place recently at Warner Bros-owned DC.

On Monday night, in front of a movie theatre on 67th Street and Broadway, women of all ages dressed in all shades of pink mix with a surprising number of Kens – men attending the show in neon pink singlets, white shorts, and white socks and sneakers. One wears a T-shirt with the slogan “Future trophy wife” printed across it. Everyone exchanges glances and smiles.

It’s the day before the Screen Actors Guild goes <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/us-actors--strike-2023">on strike</a>, shuttering TV shows, feature films, press junkets, the lot.

This scene could be it.”</p><p>He’s had a good innings, 61-year-old Broderick, and appears to be ageing at a slower rate than the rest of us.

Since then his fanbase has grown old while he’s stayed much the same: fresh-faced and boyish, slightly rounded at the edges. “I always wanted to have a long career,” he says. “And it’s been 40 years, so I guess I must have done something right.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/aug/04/my-legacy-im-ferris-bueller-matthew-broderick-on-life-love-and-opioids">Continue reading...</a>

## Babies are natural art critics: no wonder they love Van Gogh  | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett

<p>When it comes to creative expression, adults could learn from the playfulness, humour and imagination of children</p><p>I’ll admit I felt quite vindicated when I read of a new study this week that found that babies <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/aug/02/adults-penchant-for-van-gogh-mirrored-in-babies-study-finds">like Van Gogh</a>. It seems he’s as popular with the under-ones as he is with adults, or, more accurately: the adult preference for his work is mirrored in babies, suggesting certain biases in what we choose to look at are already present in infancy and carry over into adulthood. When choosing art for the baby’s room, I looked at work created for that purpose, and almost all of it was saccharine and of poor quality. So I decided on fine art instead. I thought for a long time about which images to choose, wanting something that reflected what I thought he would enjoy, rather than my own specific taste. In the end I opted for <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/the-starry-night/bgEuwDxel93-Pg?hl=en-GB&amp;ms=%7B%22x%22%3A0.5%2C%22y%22%3A0.5%2C%22z%22%3A9.80219596598225%2C%22size%22%3A%7B%22width%22%3A1.8345902318700182%2C%22height%22%3A1.2375000000000007%7D%7D">The Starry Night</a>, feeling instinctively that he would appreciate its mesmeric swirls as he drifts off to sleep.</p><p>The other two I chose were the brightest Jackson Pollock that I could find, and a pleasingly exuberant <a href="https://www.phillips.com/detail/david-hockney/NY010720/10">landscape by David Hockney</a>. (It hardly needs explaining that these are posters that I am talking about. Were they actual originals, I would be writing this from my villa in the Luberon.) Before you pull me up on the lack of representation of female artists, I keep meaning to move the Lee Krasner in the hall in there, and I felt Georgia O’Keeffe was too vaginal, though I suppose babies should sometimes be reminded of where they are from (“She always rejected that interpretation of her work,” I said to my husband, when he remarked upon the print in the bathroom. “Be real,” he said, “It’s a vag”). And so the only female artist represented is my mother, Anna, with her beautiful painting of the bay at Naoussa, Paros. It turns out that this was a good choice, too, as the study found that infants gaze longer at stretches of sky.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/04/art-babies-van-gogh-children-natural">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The writer and comedian presents an unflinching and brutally funny account of her battle with mental illness</p><p>Ruby Wax’s memoir opens in a psychiatric unit where she is undergoing transcranial magnetic stimulation, a treatment for depression delivered via a large headset that stimulates nerve cells in the brain. For Wax, “it feels like Woody Woodpecker and his cartoon pals are gangbanging in my head”. After 12 years of relative calm, the “Big Dip” had crept up and hit her hard. “Depression is the black hole of diseases, where you sit helpless as your mind hammers you with accusations,” she notes. “Your thoughts attack like little demons biting chunks of your brain. It’s hard to stay alive and listen.”</p><p>I’m Not As Well As I Thought I Was recounts this spiral into mental illness, which began while she was researching a new book about her search for meaning and self-fulfilment. We follow Wax as she goes on a month-long silent retreat near San Francisco and volunteers at a refugee centre in Greece. While visiting a monastery in Yorkshire, she finds she can no longer contain the “typhoon of mental torture” blowing through her mind. And so she takes a train back to London for “my latest adventure. Not a journey to find meaning, but a journey towards a fully fledged breakdown.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/04/im-not-as-well-as-i-thought-i-was-by-ruby-wax-audiobook-review-a-wild-ride-through-depression">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Brands love to use the work of late, great artists just as much as late, great artists’ estates like to cash in. But that hasn’t stopped a slew of Succession-size squabbles</p><p>Anyone unfamiliar with the machinations of the art world could be forgiven for thinking that great art simply finds its way to the light of day. In reality, nothing could be further from the truth – particularly when it comes to the art of the dead. How we experience an artist’s work in the present is in large part down to the inheritors of their estates, who shape the way artists are understood, act as gatekeepers to their archives, preside over the authentication of works and, increasingly, are finding novel and depressing ways to cash in on the reputations of the deceased.</p><p>As with anything to do with inheritance, the death of an artist and the management of their estate has a habit of eliciting strong emotions and extreme behaviour. There are tales of extraordinary labours of love, in which confidants and relatives devote themselves to honouring the work of the dead. If it weren’t for Leonardo da Vinci’s pupil Francesco Melzi, who dedicated his life to organising <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/oct/19/leonardo-da-vinci-lusts">his master’s papers</a>, we would know little of Leonardo’s thoughts on the relationship between art and science.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/aug/04/artists-estates-licensing-basquiat-picasso">Continue reading...</a>

Uprooting himself from a comfortable life in Rome, he flew to England in the hope of finally making his childhood dream a reality. Yet after countless rejected job applications, Galante found himself flipping Big Macs in Thornton Heath McDonald’s. Dejected, he gave up on his digital dream, leaving what he says might be “the worst McDonald’s in the UK” to code slot machines for a gambling company. Now, 10 years and one bedroom-made game later, Galante is the proud owner of two Baftas.</p><p>“I’m still in disbelief,” reflects an endearingly humble Galante. “I don’t believe that any of this is really happening – this is all just [me having] a very long psychotic break.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/aug/04/baftas-video-game-vampire-survivors-luca-galante">Continue reading...</a>

<p>You’ll have an over-eager list of instructions to follow, but if in doubt follow these golden rules</p><p>Ah, the great British summer. Perhaps you’re lucky enough to escape it all with a holiday, or maybe you’re staying at home and have volunteered to look after someone else’s garden. Depending on whose garden, this can be a holiday of its own. Other people’s gardens can offer plenty, novelty chief among them. If you don’t have access to your own open space, looking after another’s garden is akin to borrowing a dog for the weekend, offering you all of the good bits (lazing around, dining alfresco, counting butterflies) with none of the bad (mollusc-based concerns, tidying sheds, fox poo). If you do have a garden, someone else’s can offer opportunity for stealing ideas as well as new perspectives on your own. Perhaps your beds aren’t doing too badly, after all.</p><p>If your pal’s enough of a gardener to enlist you to look after their space, chances are you’ll have an over-eager list of instructions to follow. If not, these are the crucial ones: if it’s been dry, water the containers, the veg patch and the roses; don’t go mad watering the beds or the lawn. Make sure you’re watering the soil, rather than the leaves, and do so either in the morning or the evening – anything done in the middle of the day will evaporate before it hits the roots.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/aug/04/the-joy-of-gardensitting-very-little-work-and-a-lot-of-reward">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Director Ben Wheatley serves up a busy but flavourless bouillabaisse of ideas nicked from Jaws, Jurassic Park, Alien and Sharknado, and leaves it to Statham to occasionally raise a droll smile</p><p>“A relationship, I think, is like a shark,” says Woody Allen in Annie Hall. “It has to constantly move forward or it dies.” Ditto franchises. A prologue set in the Cretaceous period hints that Meg 2: The Trench will exceed the enjoyably tacky thrills of the 2018 seaborne monster movie by going weirder and wilder – a suspicion encouraged by the presence of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/ben-wheatley">Ben Wheatley</a> (Sightseers, A Field in England) as director. In fact, the sequel alternately treads water and splashes around frantically in search of an identity. Never settling on whether he wants his film to be Alien, Jaws, Jurassic Park or Sharknado, Wheatley serves up a bouillabaisse of all four.</p><p>Battling a 75ft-long <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/17/ancient-megalodon-shark-could-eat-a-whale-in-a-few-bites-research-suggests">megalodon</a> with an 8ft dorsal fin and five rows of teeth is another sort of formidable, remorseless beast: Jason Statham, who returns as shark-hunter and ocean-defender Jonas Taylor but still hasn’t decided whether to play the role with a cockney accent or an American one. While he’s mulling that over, he commandeers a submersible on a research trip 25,000ft below, only to find the mission gatecrashed by megs and other assorted sea monsters. It’s the multiplicity of threats that scuppers any possible scares: everything from a giant squid and velociraptor-like land-dwelling lizards to a double-crossing entrepreneur and a gang of rogue miners leave the meg playing second fiddle in its own film. Matters have come to a pretty pass when audience and characters alike see an exploding head as little more than a minor setback.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/04/meg-2-the-trench-review-jason-statham-ben-wheatley">Continue reading...</a>

<p>H Is for Hawk author Helen Macdonald and her co-writer Sin Blaché on Barbenheimer, the power of the past and how late capitalism is eating itself  </p><p>When we told people we were writing a sci-fi novel together during lockdown, they’d ask us what it was about. A reasonable question, but very hard to answer. “A love letter to genre fiction” felt insufficient, and “a military spy adventure mystery horror sci-fi queer romance thriller” too much. But now, in this glorious summer of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/24/barbie-oppenheimer-australian-box-office-total-records-barbenheimer" title="">Barbenheimer</a>, a time of proliferating memes and T-shirts printed with hot-pink mushroom clouds, we usually answer the question with “It’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/barbie" title="">Barbie</a> meets <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/19/oppenheimer-review-nolans-atom-bomb-epic-is-flawed-but-extraordinary" title="">Oppenheimer</a>”.</p><p>Set in 2010 in a universe just one perilous step from our own, Prophet was intended to be as comedic and subversive as Barbie and as darkly philosophical as Oppenheimer<em> – </em>and it also has scenes set in nuclear test towns in the Nevada desert overrun with animate plastic dolls. But the deepest connection between Prophet, Barbie<em> </em>and Oppenheimer<em> </em>is that all, in different ways, are shaped by nostalgia. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/greta-gerwig" title="">Greta Gerwig</a>’s film playfully interrogates the candy-lit utopia of a consumerist childhood, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/christopher-nolan" title="">Christopher Nolan</a>’s complex response to the terrifying romance of the cold war nuclear desert reminds us of a time when the apocalypse was easier to comprehend because it only came in nuclear flavour.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/04/our-book-is-barbie-meets-oppenheimer-why-we-wrote-about-nostalgia-in-an-era-of-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Maria Caulfield said use of private sector capacity would be ‘good value for money’ for taxpayer </p><p>The mayor of London’s announcement of financial support to ease the impact of the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) has “not touched the sides”, Caulfield says.</p><p>It emerged on Thursday that <strong>Sadiq Khan</strong> would expand the grant scheme to cover any household with a heavily polluting car or motorbike, spending an extra £50m after intense pressure over the political fallout of the plan. But Caulfield has told Sky News:</p><p>I don’t think it touched the sides of people’s concerns. I think he’s reacting to why Labour didn’t win the Uxbridge by-election. £2,000 is nothing if you’re having to replace your car.</p><p>I would stop the Ulez expansion on day one of a new mayoralty, this is too little, it’s too late.</p><p>The grants aren’t insufficient as prices for used cars and vans have gone up and the expansion in eligibility doesn’t come into effect until a week before the Ulez.</p><p>We probably expect, in all honesty, for it to peak in the next few months. We’re almost at the peak but we think it will go slightly higher. But it will then start to come down, and that’s why we’re making announcements like this now so that we are getting that capacity and that infrastructure so that patients can get their treatments more quickly.</p><p>But, yes, we’re being honest with people that the total number is likely to rise a little bit more before they start to come down.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/aug/04/health-minister-defends-plans-to-use-private-sector-to-cut-nhs-waiting-lists-uk-politics-live">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Summerhall, Edinburgh</strong><br />Welsh-Iranian musician Roshi Nasehi spins  her heritage into standup that is most impressive when she works the stories into sound pieces</p><p>Having established herself as a musician – or, more precisely, a proponent of experimental Welsh-Iranian folk-pop – <a href="https://www.roshi.biz/about.html">Roshi Nasehi</a> has set her sights on standup. It is a moot point how wise a move that was. Nasehi is a lovely performer, relaxed, genial and good company, but it would take a few rounds on the circuit to make her a comedian. If it had not been for her improvised preamble in which she chats knowingly to the audience, I’m not sure I would have realised she was trying to do standup in the first place.</p><p>And that would not be a bad thing. Ramalama Ding Dong is modestly amusing, but it has more to commend it than humour. Nasehi’s theme, as she dots from anecdote to anecdote, is the everyday racism she has encountered as the daughter of Iranians in Swansea. They are stories that sometimes involve celebrity – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/12/salman-rushdie-stabbing-attack-interview">Salman Rushdie</a> and Syd Little make appearances – but more typically take a spin through a bleak landscape of Rumbelows electronics shops, pub toilets and BNP campaigns at the school gates.</p><p>Ramalama Ding Dong is at <a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/ramalama-ding-dong">Summerhall, Edinburgh, until 13 August</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/04/ramalama-ding-dong-review-edinburgh-festival">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Canadian novelist on switching on to fiction with John Steinbeck, going off the Beats, and discovering the brilliance of Joan Didion</p><p><strong>My earliest reading memory</strong><br />I remember coming back from the West Vancouver library, eight years old, with a stack of books from the Choose Your Own Adventure series and not knowing which to read first because they all looked so exciting.</p><p><strong>The book that changed me as a teenager</strong><br />At 14 or 15 I read Tortilla Flat by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/johnsteinbeck">John Steinbeck</a> and was sideswiped by the realisation that all these characters and goings-on came not from the author’s life but his imagination. Fiction was fiction, in other words – something I already understood intellectually but hadn’t grasped emotionally, and I was disappointed by the thought that most novels were largely invention. But then I started writing, and the epiphany took on a rosy glow, because it meant I could speak of anything under the sun.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/04/patrick-dewitt-poetry-is-good-in-moments-of-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Yevgeny Prigozhin seems largely unscathed, while faith in the Russian president’s invincibility has taken a battering</p><p>In late June, thousands of Wagner group paramilitary forces launched <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/25/antony-blinken-russia-ukraine-wagner-group">a mutiny</a> in Russia. It seemed to constitute a significant challenge to Putin – the first from within his own country since the invasion – and yet it was over within 48 hours. What can its aftermath tell us about Putin’s position? And does the group still pose a threat?</p><p>The mutiny began after the country’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, ordered the mercenary soldiers to sign new contracts directly with his ministry. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the mutiny’s leader and Wagner’s longtime contractor and fixer, called for the ousting of both Shoigu and the chief of the general staff, Valery Gerasimov. A vociferous critic of how the war in Ukraine was being waged, Prigozhin also said that Vladimir Putin’s justifications for invading Ukraine were falsehoods.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/04/wagner-group-mutiny-putin-prigozhin-russia">Continue reading...</a>

<p>No part of me questioned whether this was real - I had to save my baby</p><p>‘Mom?” repeated my daughter’s voice on my phone. “I’ve messed up.” My heart sank and I started trembling. I heard a man instructing her to lie down and put her head back. My 15-year-old daughter, Briana, was at a skiing competition with my husband two hours away, and I instantly thought she’d been badly hurt. I was in my car, picking up her sister Aubrey, who is 13, from dance class in Arizona. Over the phone, I heard Briana bawling and shouting, “Help me, help me.” My blood ran ice cold and my legs turned to jelly as the man on the phone began explaining that he had my daughter, and if I told anyone he would pump her stomach full of drugs, drop her in Mexico and I would never see her again.</p><p>I sprinted into the lobby of the building where Aubrey was having her dance class. Putting the phone on mute, I wailed for help from the other parents. By this point, the man was shouting threats down the phone. A couple of mothers started calling 911. Coming out of class to hear what the fuss was about, Aubrey was thrown into a panic too. I pleaded with her to try to contact the rest of the family, but she was frozen in terror. I’ll never forget her face as she tried to process that someone had taken her sister.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/aug/04/experience-scammers-used-ai-to-fake-my-daughters-kidnap">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Smithsonian Folkways)</strong><br />Subtitled Field Recordings from the Collection of Mack McCormick 1958-1971, this 66-song set is full of gripping storytelling and arresting instrumentals from the American south</p><p>This invigorating 66-song set of broadside ballads, blues, spirituals and other field recordings from the mid-20th century American south comes with a telling title. It reveals the power dynamics at play when songs performed by African Americans were taped by white male folk collectors. The extensive archives of folklorist Mack McCormick were also selective: he called his subjects “tribal people”, as they lacked middle-class aspirations, and the recordings are also largely of men.</p><p>Nonetheless, this lavish, liner-note-heavy set aims to expand our ideas of who these men were, and of the talents they had. Lightnin’ Hopkins is its superstar, his voice and guitar full of fire and grit on eight tracks. But other gripping storytellers jostle alongside him. There’s James Tisdom, a regular at Texas rodeos, barbecues and fairs, whose steel guitar and half-spoken Salty Dog Rag are both spikily frisky. Then there’s the oaky-voiced Mance Lipscomb, a Texas tenant farmer who went on to play major folk festivals, singing about angels, the Titanic and a white farm owner, Tom Moore, who terrorised Black workers (Lipscomb’s name wasn’t included on an earlier release of McCormick’s, for fear of reprisals).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/04/playing-for-the-man-at-the-dooor-smithsonian-folkways">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There will be major support for England’s international teams, plus a boost for teaching the game in state schools, and a plan to install 100 chess tables in public parks</p><p>Rishi Sunak will announce £500,000 funding for chess in the near future. The money will provide major support for England’s men and women international chess teams, plus a boost for teaching the game in state schools along with a plan to install 100 chess tables in public parks.</p><p>The prime minister’s new move is set to be unveiled at a ceremony featuring a giant set and board on the lawn at 10 Downing Street. For English Chess Federation officials, it marks the successful end to an initiative first launched in the 1990s, when the then sports minister, Tony Banks, was enthusiastic, but Sport England did not and does not consider chess as a sport.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/04/rishi-sunak-set-to-announce-500000-government-fund-for-chess">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Fans often question their authenticity – but members of Yes, Odyssey, Soft Machine and Molly Hatchet explain why they’re keeping the flame alive despite the gripes</p><p>Last month, the southern US rock band Molly Hatchet played to more than 10,000 bikers at Berlin’s annual Motorcycle Jamboree, 45 years after their debut album was released. There’s nothing too unusual about that – plenty of veteran rock bands still play to huge audiences. What is unusual, though, is that no one who played on that first album – in fact, no one who was on any of their first six albums – was on stage in Berlin.</p><p>Not that Bobby Ingram – the band’s guitarist and owner of the trademark to the name Molly Hatchet – is bothered. “I’ve been in the band longer than any original member was,” he says (he joined in 1987). “I have tenure. I am the only one that can say I never quit, or turned my back on the fans. I did what it took to keep this thing out here.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/04/meet-the-bands-with-no-original-members-left-yes-soft-machine-odyssey-molly-hatchet">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Antarctica’s sea ice levels are plummeting as extreme weather events happen faster than scientists predicted</p><p>Antarctica is currently experiencing dramatic changes at unprecedented rates, marked by repeated extreme events. These include circum-Antarctic summer heatwaves and an autumn heatwave last year, with temperatures soaring up to 40C above the average. Moreover, both last summer and this winter, sea ice extent has reached record lows. These changes have happened even faster than scientists predicted.</p><p>These changes coincide with a broader global pattern of extreme air and sea surface temperatures, wildfires, floods, disease and other events deeply impacting ecosystems and society. Scientists have warned society about global climate change and its impacts since the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s first report in the early 1990s. The Antarctic community has done so repeatedly too.

<p>A buzzing study of how the cat-and-mouse game played by partygoers and the state shaped contemporary Britain</p><p>Dancing to music: what could be more joyful? Rhythm and sweat, release and abandon, feeling rather than thinking, being yourself and becoming someone – or something – other. Dancing gives us, however fleeting, a glimpse of freedom. It can tilt reality. This appalls puritans and fundamentalists. Too many young people “prefer the dark night to daylight”, complained James Anderton in the 1980s. “They dance like there is no tomorrow, and they spread the virus of drug abuse wherever they go. They are not of this world. They believe in very different things to you and I.”</p><p>Anderton, subject of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/happy-mondays">Happy Mondays</a> song called God’s Cop, was chief constable of Greater Manchester Police from 1976 to 1991, and believed dancing (or those kinds of it of which he disapproved) was deviant, contagious even. Plenty of lawmakers, before and after him, have thought so too, seeing the dancefloor as a battleground, a potentially countercultural space that, according to Ed Gillett, they have sought to “constrain or commodify”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/04/party-lines-by-ed-gillett-review-the-politics-of-dancing">Continue reading...</a>

## Breaking the Waves review – Emily Watson adds brilliance to von Trier’s windup of a movie

<p>In Lars von Trier’s otherwise ridiculous film, Watson brings generous substance to a punishing role as a dangerously selfless wife</p><p>Lars von Trier’s deadpan-tragic fantasy of emotional pain from 1996 is now re-released as part of retrospective dedicated to this director; it is magnificently acted, stylishly composed and entirely ridiculous from beginning to end. An operatically extravagant artsploitation ordeal that devastated saucer-eyed audiences at the Cannes film festival, Breaking the Waves won Von Trier the Grand Prix, though missed out on the Palme d’Or. It also launched him as a world-cinema superstar, though it is surely only the blazingly passionate commitment of his lead Emily Watson that gives this film its substance; she varnishes it with her own luminous talent and commitment. It is perhaps to Watson that Von Trier owes his entire career.</p><p>Breaking the Waves is set in a quaintly imagined remote Scottish community in the pre-cellphone era of the 70s and 80s, many of whose menfolk are away for long periods on an oil rig. It is dominated by a fiercely patriarchal, joyless, puritanical and rather Scandinavian-looking church whose elders are in the habit of condemning wrongdoers to hell in special sinners’ burials. The sheer cruelty of these ceremonies is what continues to sweep this film’s fervent audiences away in horror and compassion, perhaps not quite grasping that these appalling events are a figment of Von Trier’s imagination. The director can’t help an unsubtle giggle in the initial burial scene: the sinner being interred is called “Anthony Dod Mantle”, the name of the British cinematographer who went on to shoot a number of celebrated films, including Von Trier’s Dogville and Manderlay.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/04/breaking-the-waves-review-emily-watson-adds-brilliance-to-von-triers-windup-of-a-movie">Continue reading...</a>

All his years of preparation for a new UK product safety mark, all his thousands of pounds wasted, all the uncountable hours and effort were rendered pointless, at a stroke.

The Brexiters rejected 30 years of using the European CE mark (whisper it, but it stands for the awful Conformité Européenne), recognised worldwide as a gold standard. All for what? Out of pure Brexit mania so that nationalist Britain would have its own, forcing double inspections. What’s more, all EU suppliers or exporters to the UK had to apply for the new UKCA mark, a strong disincentive to trade with the UK.</p><p>Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/04/business-brexit-safety-mark-red-tape-">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This thickly portentous novel adaptation is gorgeously shot, and perfectly captures the threat of violence that men can represent to women. Shame it has the odd teeth-itching moment …</p><p>I’m glad I’m not a prestigious limited TV drama. It looks exhausting. Such is the faint but persistent feeling that comes with watching The Lost Flowers of Alice Hart (the slightly laborious title being the perfect foreshadow of the entire experience). It is good – it is – but, crikey, you can feel every ounce of effort that has gone into making it so.</p><p>Every scene is gorgeously shot and dripping with meaning, rife with Symbolism-with-a-capital-S, suffused with evocations of memories and studded with seeds of future plotlines.
