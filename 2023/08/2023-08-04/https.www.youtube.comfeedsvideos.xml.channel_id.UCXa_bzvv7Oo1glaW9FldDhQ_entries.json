But though Kotal Kahn is a fairly recent addition to the series\u2019 roster, he has already built up quite a fan following for himself. \n\nPerfectly toeing the line between being a ruthless and terrifying powerful Outworld Emperor and being an honourable leader who denounces bloodlust, Kotal Kahn has made a strong impression in the stories he has been involved in up to this point. And here, those stories are exactly what we\u2019ll be talking about.\n\nPlease consider subscribing for more awesome videos! https://www.youtube.com/@GamingBolt?sub_confirmation=1\n\nTime stamps:\n\nIntro 00:00\nThe Origins of Kotal Kahn 1:15\nKotal Kahn's initial battles 2:22\nKotal Kahn in Mortal Kombat X 8:14\nKotal Kahn in Mortal Kombat 11 9:43\nThe End 11:57", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w6w0DvJtDQ", "date_published": "2023-08-04T15:30:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/1w6w0DvJtDQ/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "10 Spider-Man 2 Theories SO CRAZY They Might Be True", "description": "So far, with Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man and Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Insomnia has told two excellent stories that might even rank as some of the best Spider-Man stories across all media in recent memory, which isn\u2019t praise that\u2019s lightly given. \n\nExpectations are naturally high for Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man 2, and while we wait with bated breath to see what new spin Insomniac will put on this excellent Spider-Man universe of its own that it\u2019s created, there\u2019s also no shortage of theories going around about just what that\u2019ll entail. Some of them, of course, are a bit hard to buy into, as fan theories often are, but at the same time, there are a few that may very well have a good chance of turning out to be accurate.
