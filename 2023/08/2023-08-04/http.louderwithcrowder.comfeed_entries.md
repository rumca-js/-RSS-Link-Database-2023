She is set to make her return to television (ish) with a brand new show on Elon Musk's X. It feels weird not calling it Twitter. And if you just say "X," it sounds like something Roseanne Connor took so ABC could kill her off the last show.</p><p>Roseanne signed a six-figure deal with Publicsq, a new online marketplace looking to become the "anti-woke" alternative to Amazon. The two hooked up after <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/theo-von-youtube-roseanne-barr" target="_blank">a Leftist sh*tc*nt took a Barr joke that utilized the word "Holocaust" out of context</a> and YouTube removed the podcast -- after it was clear the Left was lying -- over alleged "hate speech."</p><p>Barr tells <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/08/03/roseanne-barr-lands-new-show-on-elon-musks-x/" target="_blank">On The Money</a> of the new partnership, "We’re followers of Elon and it’s pretty evident to us that whatever we want goes. It’s a great way for people to fight back against totalitarianism."</p><p>Unclear is what format the show will take. Sources tell OTM it "could involve a written monologue or sketch comedy, be at least a half-hour long, and air monthly."</p><p>I'm holding out hope for a return to sitcoms. Something before a live-studio audience where Roseanne is raising a progressive twat like David Hogg would be laugh-out-loud funny. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/roseanne-returns-to-stand-up-torches-low-rated-abc" target="_self">Andrew "Dice" Clay</a> can play the dad. Hogg would never sign on, but it's not like they wouldn't have 1,001 scrawny drama majors looking for their big break.</p><p>As resident oldhead here at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website, I'm old enough to have been around in the 80s when <em>Roseanne</em> and <em>Married... with Children</em> broke the sitcom mold showing middle-class families that resembles us much more than show like The Brady Bunch did. ABC brought <em>Roseanne</em> back a few years ago and it exploded because it was the only show where a Trump supporter (Roseanne Connor) was viewed as a normal human.</p><p>Then Trump-supporting Roseanne Barr made a joke about Valerie Jarrett and Hollywood had the excuse to fire her that they were waiting for.</p><p>I'm just saying. Seeing what Roseanne Donner is up to six years later would be fun. The opening scene could be her writing a book that shows the last six years never happened. It would be like a based version of the two Beckys,</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

Then on Monday in broad daylight, three-man ran in with another smash and grab that has become common in progressive cities in progressive states. Oh, by the way, this is California.</p><p>All it took was a minute, and Alan <a href="https://abc7.com/irvine-jewelry-store-robbed-smash-and-grab-robbery-jewels-by-alan/13583676/" target="_blank">tells ABC7</a> he's not sure what to do next. "I am absolutely numb trying to figure out what's our next step. ... I have a family to feed. I have bills. This lease we still have to pay for, the insurance, all kinds of stuff."</p><p>Irvine police Sgt. Karie Davies says this smash-and-grab was unique in that they didn't just smash and grab. They brought garbage cans with them to fill with stolen goods. "It kind of just shows you the mentality that they either don't think they're going to get caught or they don't care if they get caught."</p><p>Right. Because they live in Califonia and know if they get caught the progressive officials in charge won't do anything. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/shoplifting-smash-grab-los-angeles" target="_blank">We've seen this in Los Angeles</a>. Where fourteen thugs were arrested for a smash and grab and the DA released them back out <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-12-02/lapd-announces-14-arrests-smash-and-grab-robberies" target="_blank">onto the streets the next day</a>.</p><p>This is the result:</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>This is one of the reasons I want to see a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-gavin-newsom-hannity" target="_blank">Ron DeSantis vs Gavin Newsom 1-on-1 debate</a>. Let's see Newsom defend his policies that have led to an increase in crime. As opposed to Florida, where they handle <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/smash-grab-orlando-owner" target="_blank">smash and grabs much differently</a>. One Florida store owner puts it like this:</p><p>"There are a lot of concealed carriers here, so if you come to [Florida malls] and you wanna commit a crime, there's a really good chance you might get shot."<br /></p><p>Alan hopes suspects are caught before they commit another crime against another family-owned business. It's doubtful.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Police arrest man who stabbed someone in the head with an American Flag outside a Sonic drive-thru

Please don't think we don't realize there is crime out in real America also. Like in Oklahoma, where a man was arrested for stabbing another man through the head with an American Flag. Outside of a Sonic Drive-Thru.</p><p>I know what you're thinking, and I agree. When I heard that a man stabbed someone another man through the head with an American Flag outside of a Sonic Drive-Thru, I pictured the American Flag stabber to look just like this:</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="2549a" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=34782631&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>That's Clinton Collins. He's enjoying a stay in the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/facebook-post-oklahoma-arrrest" target="_blank">Tulsa correctional facilities</a> and facing a felony maiming charge. Shockingly, this was not his first felony,</p><p>Police responded to a stabbing call around 7:30 last Wednesday. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tulsapolice/posts/pfbid02KZu2S6sW6X8Sr2SfSHiDXdXBidAjRCQo8Kc3BZ1m4pUodM67PDNQVnwDy6UrwkQDl" target="_blank">When Officers arrived</a>, they found the victim with a flagpole through his head. It went in beneath his jaw and out near his right temple area. And the American Flag was still attached to the pole at the time. </p><p>Officer Danny Bean tells Fox23: "A flagpole, I mean it’s a very, it’s kind of a violent act for sure. It’s very violent to run a hole through someone’s head. You know, with intent to do it. It wasn’t an accident."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="dff15" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=34782838&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Collins was unapologetic, hear yelling "That's what he gets. He deserved it." </p><p>The man will survive but lost an eye. Firefighters had to cut part of the flagpole in order to fit the victim into the ambulance.</p><p>Lost in any media coverage is the most important part of this story. What the deuce happened that would cause a man to pick up an American Flag and stab another man in the head with it? There had to have been an argument or altercation. You just don't grab the American flag and stab someone in the head with it for the sh*ts and giggles of doing so.</p><p>The other man had to have done something or said something to make Clinton Collins so full of rage, stabbing him in the face with the American Flag was the only logical response. We need more context because Collins could be the good guy here. Just sayin'.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: Joe Biden resurrecting the "Dark Brandon" meme reaches unprecedented levels of cringe

Eleventy takes later, they had this tweet resurrecting the "Dark Brandon" meme.</p><p>The fact this was released on the day of the indictment, I'm sure it was meant to be an "in-your-face" dig at the Right. But instead of giving them the reaction they want by acting outraged, I can barely roll my eyes. If you combined the Happy Madison "how do you do, fellow kids" meme and the Abe Simpson "old man yells at cloud" meme, you'd get this.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</p><p>At the beginning of September 2021, week 1 of college football, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/top-5-f-joe-biden">some dudebros did many beers before a game and started chanting "F*ck Joe Biden"</a>. It captivated a nation.  Shout out to <a href="https://twitter.com/OldRowOfficial" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the fine lads at Old Row</a>. Had it not been for Old Row posting the first video, collecting others, and disseminating them throughout their Twitter accounts, the F*ck Joe Biden chant wouldn't have been everywhere.</p><div class="rm-shortcode"><div class="fb-video"></div></div><p>Then one day after a guy named Brandon won a Nascar race, the reporter interviewing him thought the crowd chanting "F*ck Joe Biden" was saying "Let's Go Brandon." That's when things REALLY took off. Americans now had a family-friendly way to express how Joe Biden is a failure of a man and sucks at life. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lets-go-brandon-itunes-charts" target="_blank">There were songs written</a>. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lets-go-brandon-tiktok-dance" target="_blank">There were dance challenges</a>.
