On this week's Spot On, Lucy and Tam discuss the Switch 2 rumours, and argue that Nintendo has forged its own path with hardware, but it's no longer the only one in that space and it needs to start being competitive again.

With VGC reporting that a Switch successor will hit the market in 2024, Lucy and Tam discuss what Nintendo need to do to remain competitive in the handheld gaming market. There's no denying that Nintendo's Switch is the king, but with the surging popularity of more powerful handhelds like the Steam Deck and ASUS ROG Ally, is Nintendo still going to be able to cater to the third party market with less powerful hardware? Tam and Lucy discuss, and make a very tenuous metaphor about an island. 

Spot On is GameSpot's weekly news show in which managing editor Tamoor Hussain and senior producer Lucy James talk about the latest news in games. Given the highly dynamic and never-ending news cycle of the massive video game industry, there's always something to talk about but, unlike most other news shows, Spot On will dive deep into a single topic as opposed to recapping all the news. Spot On airs each Friday.

Baldur’s Gate 3 has a steep learning curve and if you’re struggling, we’re here to help. Here are the biggest things we wish we knew before fighting enemies in our favorite DnD-based video game. 

Baldur’s Gate 3 is a deep sandbox game with an overwhelming amount of systems at play. If you’re familiar with DnD or have been playing the early access build help us out in the comments below. In this video, we’re going over the most important things to understand early in the game.
In no particular order, we’re going to give you a baseline on how this game views you as a player whether you be a wizard, warlock, bard, or any number of races or party compositions. Spoilers, everything can and will kill you if you don’t size up situations ahead of time. We’ll teach you the importance of exploring areas with the right party member first such as going into dangerous animal caves with your Druid up front or holy sites with your Cleric. We’re covering how to prepare for fights including when to use long rests, short rests, or just call it a day and head back to camp. We’re covering how to set up a fight before it even begins by going undetected and leading off with AOE attacks, bombs, or sneaking for bonus damage. We’re covering how to use the environment to your advantage including mud, spider webs, and even doors. You can use old fashion explosive barrels as well as makeshift weapons. Then we’ll cover vital and often overlooked mechanics like how to shove, jump, disengage, or even throw your friends. There are many other tips to cover like swapping to non-lethal combat in morally grey situations. 
Baldur’s Gate 3 is out now for PC and releases for PS5 on September 6th. Pre-ordering on PS5 will give you a 72 head start. Xbox Series S|X has no current firm release date.
