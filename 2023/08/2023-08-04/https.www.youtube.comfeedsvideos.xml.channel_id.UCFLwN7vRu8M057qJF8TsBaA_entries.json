Next is Fallout: New Vegas, then Starfield. \n\nSkyrim is one of my favorite games, and I tried to make this review similar to my older ones, as I found making my Disco Elsium review a bit stressful. \n\nI used ideas I used to use, like green screening myself into Skyrim, keeping sketches short and to the point, and reviewing other games within the Skyrim review. This time is was Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom and the Resident Evil 4: Remake. \n\nENJOY\n\nPatreon bros: https://www.patreon.com/UpIsNotJump \nMerch-o-bros: https://www.pixelempire.com/pages/upisnotjump\nTwitter-o-fish: https://twitter.com/UpIsNotJump \n\nSkeleton dance video by: @Sorenova \nVoice of Luna (the cat):  Reny Amoros\nEditing workflow partly by: https://twitter.com/MudanTV", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxeMuy2s_hI", "date_published": "2023-08-04T19:26:10+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/BxeMuy2s_hI/hqdefault.jpg"}]
