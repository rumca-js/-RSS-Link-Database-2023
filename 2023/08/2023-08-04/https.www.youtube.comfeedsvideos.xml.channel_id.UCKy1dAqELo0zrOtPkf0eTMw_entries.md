The Expanse: A Telltale Series Episodes 1-3 reviewed by Zack Handlen.

The Expanse: A Telltale Series is a solid entry in the studio’s long-running series of narrative-driven games. The episodes look great, and Cara Gee’s performance as the main character is excellent, helping to recreate the feel of the television series even when the most of the regular characters from the show are absent. The game struggles to find engaging mechanics outside of its dialogue scenes, relying too heavily on quicktime events and mediocre movement challenges. But the story and choices you make work well enough that these are minor faults.

If all the drugs, sex and hyperviolence of superhero satire The Boys isn’t enough for you, there’s a spinoff on the way: Gen V. Based on an arc from the original The Boys comics series by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson, Gen V follows the journey of a young group of heroes who get thrown into battle royale challenges at Godolkin University School of Crimefighting, a superhero school run by Vought International. Sounds like a fun series, but a look through the comic book source material reveals that the series might be The Boys’ f***ed up answer to the X-Men.
