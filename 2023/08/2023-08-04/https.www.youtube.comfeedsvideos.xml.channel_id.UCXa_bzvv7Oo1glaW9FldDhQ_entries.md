The Mortal Kombat franchise is overflowing with fascinating characters, many of whom have been around for years on end. But though Kotal Kahn is a fairly recent addition to the series’ roster, he has already built up quite a fan following for himself.

Some of them, of course, are a bit hard to buy into, as fan theories often are, but at the same time, there are a few that may very well have a good chance of turning out to be accurate.
