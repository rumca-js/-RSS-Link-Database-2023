And in the hands of Colombian musician Gregorio Uribe, the accordion is both a melodic and rhythmic wonder. As he launches into \"Damasco\" with his two musical partners, Jonathan Gomez on percussion and Andres Garcia on bass, images of the lush Colombian countryside push through the bright melodies of the accordion and Uribe's impassioned vocals.\n\nThe performance is an explosion of both folkloric vallenatoand cumbiaand. as Uribe explains, the lively rhythms can often defy the seriousness of the lyrics \u2014 he describes \"Atlas\"as an existential crisis set to a very danceable rhythm. \"Media Naranja\" explodes into a percussive jam session and \"Ay Leonardo\" evolves into a joyful singalong as Uribe demonstrates how the spirit of Colombian folk music becomes universal in the right hands.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Damasco\"\n\"Atlas\"\n\"Media Naranja\" \n\"Ay Leonardo\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nGregorio Uribe: accordion, vocals \nJonathan Gomez: percussion, vocals\nAndres Garcia: bass, vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Felix Contreras\nDirector/Editor: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nCreative Director: Bob Boilen\nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Maia Stern\nAudio Assistant: Josephine Nyounai\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Estefania Mitre\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Hazel Cills\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #gregoriouribe", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0sUBp7ps8k", "date_published": "2023-08-04T09:00:23+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/O0sUBp7ps8k/hqdefault.jpg"}]
