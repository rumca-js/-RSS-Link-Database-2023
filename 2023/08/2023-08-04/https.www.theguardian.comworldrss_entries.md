<p>Australia has ‘nothing to fear’ from yes vote, prime minister will say</p><ul><li><strong>Get our <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/29/email-newsletters-guardian-australia-best-daily-news-emails-newsletter-free-sign-up-inbox-subscribe-headlines?CMP=cvau_sfl">morning and afternoon news emails</a>, <a href="https://app.adjust.com/w4u7jx3">free app</a> or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/full-story?CMP=cvau_sfl">daily news podcast</a></strong></li></ul><p>As <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> prepares to deliver his keynote speech at the Garma festival focusing on the voice to parliament, our chief political correspondent <strong>Paul Karp</strong> looks at how he has been struggling to counter the negative tactics of the no campaign.</p><p>In particular Paul looks at how the prime minister, after being questioned about a T-shirt he once wore with the slogan “Voice, treaty, truth”, got tangled up in the issue about whether or not a yes vote in the voice referendum will pave the way for a wider treaty.</p><p>It is arguable that facts like Albanese wore a treaty shirt, Albanese supports the Uluru statement, and Labor has given funding for a Makarrata Commission are not very newsworthy because they lack currency.</p><p>These things don’t simply “emerge” – they are resurfaced by the opposition and imbued with a renewed significance by reporting in the context of the referendum debate. Putting the second and third planks of the Uluru statement back in front of the public creates a problem for Albanese, requiring him to disentangle them from the voice.</p><p>There are more intellectually honest ways of having this argument. Dutton could simply have said: although treaties aren’t on the ballot, a no vote will stop them before the idea catches on.</p><p>But that would force voters to confront whether the real motive of the no campaign is to stop the long, slow walk of reconciliation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/aug/05/australia-news-live-anthony-albanese-garma-festival-indigenous-voice-to-parliament-peter-dutton-tasmanian-liberal-meeting">Continue reading...</a>
