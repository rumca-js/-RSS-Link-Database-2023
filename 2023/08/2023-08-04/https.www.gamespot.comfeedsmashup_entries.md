<p>Your character and companions can gain abilities in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/">Baldur's Gate 3</a>.

However, there are stronger variants that you can obtain. Our guide discusses how you can unlock more high-tier Illithid Powers in Baldur's Gate 3. Likewise, please be reminded that this guide contains spoilers.</p><h2>How to Unlock More High-Tier Illithid Powers in Baldur's Gate 3</h2><p>To unlock the Baldur's Gate 3 high-tier Illithid Powers, you need to rescue the Emperor Mind Flayer.

## Overwatch 2: Invasion's Story Missions Trailer Teases PvE Roster And Giant Robot Battles

<p>After years of Overwatch players longing for story-based PvE missions, Blizzard is ready to deliver. With the launch of Overwatch 2's sixth season, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/overwatch-2-invasion-reveal-full-presentation/2300-6461728/">Invasion</a>, comes the series' push into storytelling with an all-new game mode: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-overwatch-2-new-story-missions-and-progression-system-work/1100-6515392/">story missions</a>. And, thanks to Overwatch 2: Invasion's latest trailer, we now have a better idea as to what the first three entries in this new mode will entail.</p><p>The trailer begins with footage of three cities, Rio de Janeiro, Gothenburg, and Toronto, being evacuated. We then see Ramattra--Overwatch 2's newest tank hero and the leader of the militant omnic liberation group, Null Sector--claim he is not waging war on these locations, but rather fighting for "liberation." Winston declares there is something different about Null Sector this time around before the trailer cuts to Sojourn, who tells him that most of her city (Toronto) has been taken over by the organization. This seemingly builds off of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sojourns-new-overwatch-2-cinematic-features-story-missions-and-a-corgi/1100-6516587/">Sojourn's most recent cinematic</a>, which ends with the former soldier readying up for battle against a fleet of enemy ships entering Toronto.</p><p>However, Sojourn isn't the only one dealing with a full-scale invasion, as we see Lucio skate through an overrun Rio de Janeiro while Brigette and her father, Torbjörn, struggle to hold down Gothenburg. In addition to these characters, the trailer also features Mei, Reinhardt, Genji, Mercy, Tracer, and Bastion. Considering Overwatch 2 developers have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-invasion-launches-in-august-adding-story-missions-and-new-modes/1100-6515062/">previously stated</a> that story missions will utilize only a select number of heroes in an effort to meaningfully include them in the story and create something that makes narrative sense, it seems likely that these heroes will serve as the Invasion storyline's roster.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-invasion-story-missions-trailer-pve-roster-and-giant-robot-battles/1100-6516596/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## John Cena Joins Overwatch 2 As The Enigma

<p>Contrary to his iconic tagline, you can now see John Cena in Overwatch 2. After a week of teases "leaked" during popular streamers such as Shroud, Emongg, Kyedae, and Scump's Twitch streams, Blizzard has revealed that the wrestler-turned-actor is joining the game as The Enigma, a mysterious figure seemingly aiding Overwatch's heroic efforts.</p><p>Blizzard shared the news in a brief trailer showcasing Cena's Enigma. In the video, The Enigma is seen hunched over a computer, working in the shadows as he observes omnic uprisings emerge in Rio, Gothenburg, and Toronto. The Enigma then begins a transmission to the former agents of Overwatch, alerting them to these invasions before stating: "Answer the call, heroes. It's time to fight back." After sending the message, he removes his hood, revealing not an animated character, but John Cena himself.</p><div>          </div><p>Though Cena's inclusion is certainly a bit surprising--this is the first time Blizzard has added a real-life figure to Overwatch--particularly sleuthy fans <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/john-cena-and-overwatch-2-collaboration-rumors-heat-up/1100-6516406/">predicted he'd be coming to the game thanks to some serious detective work</a>. Last week, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/15c96zp/comment/jtv0yyr/">Reddit</a> user shared a clip from one Emongg's recent streams, noting that the code was in the font family "Felix-Antony'--John Cena's middle names. In addition, a shortened URL shown in the clip linked to an image reading "JC" using the color code "#042377," which translates to Cena's birthday, April 23, 1977.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/john-cena-joins-overwatch-2-as-the-enigma/1100-6516595/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Apex Legends Season 18 - Revenant's New Abilities, No More Skydive Trails, And Double XP

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/">Apex Legends</a> Season 18: Resurrection is almost here, and it's bringing some serious changes to the game. The upcoming season includes a new battle pass, a new animated web series, a new collection event, and a brand new set of abilities for the oldest character in the game. But there's a lot more to Season 18 than murderbot makeovers, and we've got the scoop. Keep reading for a detailed breakdown of everything we know about Season 18, including map rotations, details on the removal of an iconic Ranked Mode reward, and a sneak peek at the next Heirloom Weapon set to hit the game.</p><h2 dir="ltr">When does Apex Legends Season 18 begin?</h2><p dir="ltr">Apex Legends Season 18: Resurrection will go live on Tuesday, August 8 at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET. No end date has been announced yet, but Apex's seasons always last approximately three months, so Resurrection is likely to end in late October or early November.</p><h2 dir="ltr">No new legend</h2><p dir="ltr">Similar to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-16-revelry-launch-trailer-confirms-tdm-is-coming-but-no-new-legend/1100-6511197/">Season 16</a>, Season 18 will not feature a new legend, but will instead be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-18-gameplay-trailer-confirms-revenants-new-abilities/1100-6516523/">reworking the abilities of a pre-existing legend</a>. This shouldn't come as a surprise--Respawn devs have previously stated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-character-releases-may-slow-down-in-the-future/1100-6503116/">new legend releases are likely to slow down</a> in the future.

In fact, Respawn has stated that although Season 17 did not meet the studio's financial expectations, Season 16--which also lacked a new legend debut and instead focused on quality-of-life improvements--was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-17-did-not-meet-eas-financial-expectations/1100-6516483/">one of the game's most successful seasons</a>.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-18-revenants-new-abilities-no-more-skydive-trails-and-double-xp/1100-6516547/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Wayfinder - Best Classes And Which Class To Pick

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/679/6794662/4172051-1%281%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wayfinder/">Wayfinder</a> is a shared-world game from Airship Syndicate with a strong focus on procedurally-generated dungeons, lots of crafting, and an engaging story. You'll set off on a journey either solo or with a group of friends to explore and help save the gorgeous but deadly world of Evenor. To do so, you'll take on the role of unique Wayfinders--a selection of individual characters that serve as the game's classes--each bringing their own utility to team compositions.</p><p>Each Wayfinder has its strengths and weaknesses--some bringing more defense or more damage based on their typical role in the group. Wayfinders like Wingrave or Senja will be good choices for those interested in providing their team with various protections or healing, while options such as Niss or Kyros will rip through enemies with precision and speed. Which Wayfinder you pick will define your solo capabilities as well as your place on the teams you join, so you'll want to think things through.</p><p>With so much riding on the choice you make, it's fair to say the decision may not be an easy one. But it's important that you pick the character that works best for your playstyle in the beginning, as it may take you quite a lot of time to gather the resources necessary to craft new Wayfinders to equip. We've compiled a full list of the available Wayfinders below with some information about the basics of their role, their skills, and their signature weapon. If you'd like to know which of these characters fits your vibe the best, read on.</p><p>Lastly, note that <strong>while this list isn't entirely ranked, we have put our two favorite Wayfinders at the top</strong>, so consider them the best above the rest.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Wingrave - Best starter class</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/679/6794662/4172049-character-indiv-desktop.png" /><br /><h3><p>Wingrave is arguably the best Wayfinder for beginner players due to his easy-to-grasp kit and high survivability. This melee-centric templar is the game's least complex character and can fit into more than one role in a group. He's a tank that can form multiple shields to protect himself and his teammates from damage, but he also functions as a healer who can keep his allies' HP topped off by draining health from foes when using melee finishers.</p><p><strong>Skills</strong></p><ul><li>Righteous Strike - Hitting an enemy causes an explosion of healing energy to shoot out and heal Wingrave and nearby allies.</li><li>Radiant Pulse - Forms a Divine Shield that blocks projectiles and boosts the defense of allies standing behind it.</li><li>Judgment - Marks enemies for judgment. Anyone hitting a Judged enemy will restore their own health.</li><li>Divine Aegis - A powerful barrier that makes anyone standing in it immune to damage and heals them over time.</li></ul><p><strong>Passive Ability</strong></p><ul><li>Healing Pulse - Melee finishers heal Wingrave and one nearby ally.</li></ul><p><strong>Signature Weapon</strong></p><ul><li>Bastion (Sword and Shield)</li></ul></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Kyros - Best DPS class</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/679/6794662/4172054-character-indiv-desktop-1668739426.png" /><br /><h3><p>Kyros is a deadly warmage who uses a mix of melee and arcane magic to dish out huge damage to his enemies. Because his kit is built almost exclusively around damaging abilities, he has little in the way of defense, though. But despite being a glass cannon, his ease of use and quick kill time make him an easy choice for any type of player.</p><p><strong>Skills</strong></p><ul><li>Savage Rake - Rakes the ground with violent energy, dealing damage to all enemies in front of Kyros. Arcane Fragments can be consumed to cast Savage Rake at no cost.</li><li>Siphon Radiant - Releases a wave of energy around Kyros that damages enemies and absorbs arcane power, reducing cooldowns and granting an Arcane Fragment.</li><li>Arcane Focus - Marks enemies in an area. As enemies are hit, the mark builds up in power and detonates at max, or when it expires.</li><li><p>Hand of Reckoning - Deals massive damage to enemies in a large radius around Kyros.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Passive</strong></p><ul><li>Arcane Fragments -<strong> </strong>Generate Arcane Fragments by using Siphon Radiant on enemies, and landing combo finishers. Arcane Fragments are automatically consumed to grant extra charges of Savage Rake.</li></ul><p><strong>Signature Weapon</strong></p><ul><li>Epitaph (Two-Handed Scythe)</li></ul><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Niss - Best mobility class</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/679/6794662/4172052-character-indiv-desktop-1668738551.png" /><br /><h3><p>Niss is one of the most complex Wayfinders and requires a lot of mobility to be used effectively, but mastering her skillset can be very rewarding. Because she's a shadow assassin, her kit uses a lot of dashing and rapid attacks that really bring the hurt. But the substantial damage she brings to the table comes at a cost--she simply lacks much health and can die rather quickly when caught in a bad spot. </p><p><strong>Skills</strong></p><ul><li>Shadow Step - Dash in a line, dealing damage. After a short delay, a Gloom clone will dash from your initial position to you, dealing damage to enemies.</li><li>Umbral Aura - Niss is empowered by Umbral magic, causing her next three dodges to pierce a nearby enemy with shadow.</li><li>Vengeful Shade - Briefly become immune to attacks and damage enemies in front of Niss.</li><li>Gloom Shroud - For the next few seconds, Shadow Step can be used at no cost.</li></ul><p><strong>Passive</strong></p><ul><li>Lingering Shadow - After dodging, gain attack power for a short duration.</li></ul><p><strong>Signature Weapon</strong></p><ul><li>Night's Edge (Dual Blades)</li></ul></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Silo - Best control class</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/679/6794662/4172050-character-indiv-desktop-1668738143.png" /><br /><h3><p>Silo is essentially an engineer who is well-suited to ranged combat, leveraging a variety of tools like firebombs and oil to dish out AOE damage and slow enemies. This is extremely helpful for him, as he deals extra damage to enemies that are debuffed in some way. His ability to slow foes and make them easier to handle ensure that he's a good pick for new or experienced players.</p><p><strong>Skills</strong></p><ul><li>Fire Bomb - Toss a Fire Bomb that ignites enemies, dealing damage over time. Causes a chain reaction with Oil Bomb.</li><li>Oil Bomb - Leaves a pool of Oil in front of Silo, slowing enemies and causing them to take additional damage.</li><li>Proto-Clone - Dash backward, leaving behind a clone that pulls nearby enemies in. The clone will taunt nearby enemies into attacking it until it expires.</li><li>Arc Nemesis - Silo sends out EGG to shock all enemies in the area dealing a burst of damage. EGG remains in the area for a short time, slowing and damaging nearby enemies.</li></ul><p><strong>Passive</strong></p><ul><li>Strategic Advantage - Deals bonus Melee and Ranged damage to enemies that are debuffed.</li></ul><p><strong>Signature Weapon</strong></p><ul><li>Longshot (Rifle)</li></ul></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Senja - Best tank class</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/679/6794662/4172053-character-indiv-desktop-1678388187.png" /><br /><h3><p>Senja is a strong but slow tank who uses her Showboating mechanic to grant her protections and attack power. She can also taunt foes or use her lightning grab to pull them off of her foes. While she's a great ally to have on a team, her slow speed and unique gameplay mechanics make her a fairly complex pick.</p><p><strong>Skills</strong></p><ul><li>Gladiator Pummel - Punch forward, then hold to Showboat. On release, Senja punches again and buffs her next Weapon Attack. Fully Showboating increases the damage of the follow-up punch.</li><li>Gain Favor - Hold to Showboat for the roaring crowd filling your Favor. On release, taunts nearby enemies while buffing Senja and her allies.</li><li>Lightning Grasp - Use lightning to pull all displaceable enemies towards Senja in a large area.</li><li>Grand Finale - In the form of a lightning spear, Senja charges to smash an enemy, dealing massive damage to them and fully filling the Crowd's Favor.</li></ul><p><strong>Passive</strong></p><ul><li>Crowd Favorite - Holding Gladiator Pummel and Gain Favor abilities will cause Senja to Showboat. While Showboating, she cannot be staggered, takes reduced damage, and increases the Crowd's Favor. As the Crowd's Favor increases, Senja gains Attack Damage and Ability Power.</li></ul><p><strong>Signature Weapon</strong></p><ul><li>Colossus (Two-Handed Sword)</li></ul></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Venomess - Best support class</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/679/6794662/4172055-character-indiv-desktop-1683925756.png" /><br /><h3><p>Venomess brings status effect fun to the table with a kit built around poison gases, needles, and bombs. While this makes her extremely deadly in combat, some of her abilities also have secondary effects that heal her allies. Because of this, she's a spectacular option for the backlines and should fit players who enjoy ranged combat and support.</p><p><strong>Skills</strong></p><ul><li>Transfusion - Shoot a volley of poison needles that lock on to nearby enemies, dealing damage. Hitting an enemy with a needle causes a healing projectile to seek a nearby Wayfinder. These projectiles heal over time based on the number of stacks of Venom on the source enemy.</li><li>Vampiric Blast - Launch a bomb that absorbs up to 5 nearby Poison Clouds. After a brief delay, the bomb explodes, dealing damage to enemies and healing allies based on the number of Poison Clouds absorbed.</li><li>Venom Thrusters - Dash in a direction, leaving a trail of Poison Clouds behind you. Poison Clouds damage and apply stacks of Venom to enemies.</li><li>Deep Breath - Fire a massive explosion that damages and applies 5 stacks of Empowered Venom to enemies. Empowered Venom deals damage over time and counts as additional stacks of Venom for the Master of Venoms and Transfusion abilities.</li></ul><p><strong>Passive</strong></p><ul><li>Master of Venoms - Weapon hits apply Venom, dealing damage over time and stacking up to 5 times. Weapon hits against enemies with 5 stacks of Venom create a Poison Cloud that deals damage and applies stacks of Venom.

<p>Sloclap revealed that Sifu will receive its final content update on September 7 for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. The update will come to the Nintendo Switch version later.</p><p>Most of the new content involves Sifu's Arenas mode, as the update adds six new dynamic Arenas and 75 new challenges to the game. There will also be more modifiers and cheats for players to crank up the challenge. While the trailer didn't provide any details, the update will have film-inspired outfits that players can equip. Some new enemies also include doppelgangers and zombie-like adversaries.</p><div>          </div><p>Sifu first came to PlayStation and PC via the Epic Game Store back in 2022. It then came to Nintendo Switch later that year, followed by Xbox and Steam earlier this year. Previous updates included additional difficulty options, gameplay modifiers, and the initial Arenas expansion. The game is also receiving a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sifu-getting-live-action-adaptation-from-john-wicks-derek-kolstad-report/1100-6509678/">live-action adaptation</a> from John Wick's Derek Kolstad.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-sifu-update-to-launch-in-september/1100-6516597/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## The Nintendo Switch 2 Needs To Be As Powerful As Its Competitors | Spot On

<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-nintendo-switch-2-targets-2024-with-next-gen-console/">VGC</a> reported that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-already-with-developers-launching-in-2024-report/1100-6516402/">Switch successor is slated to hit the market in 2024</a>. According to various sources, the upcoming console will work in portable mode, similar to the Switch, and will revert back to an LCD screen in an effort the manage costs. However, there's one thing we remain <em>incredibly </em>curious about: What will its hardware look like?</p><p>It's no secret that when compared to Sony's PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series X|S, the Nintendo Switch severely lacks the same power and graphical fidelity. Though Nintendo has somewhat countered this hindrance with an impressive catalog of first-party games tailormade for its console, third-party games are increasingly suffering due to the system's hardware restraints. And with competitors like Valve's Steam Deck and the ASUS ROG Ally entering the marketplace, these limitations are only growing more apparent.</p><div>          </div><p>In this week's episode of Spot On, Lucy and Tam discuss what Nintendo needs to do to remain competitive in the handheld gaming market. There's no denying that Nintendo's Switch is the current king, but will Nintendo continue to hold that title if it doesn't begin to cater to the third party market and up its hardware? Tam and Lucy discuss, and make a very tenuous metaphor about an island.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-nintendo-switch-2-needs-to-be-as-powerful-as-its-competitors-spot-on/1100-6516592/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

You can see the full patch notes below.</p><p>Larian also said it is aware of reports of issues with game-saves, and the culprit was discovered to be cross-save functionality. To address this, Larian is disabling this for now--after all, it won't be relevant until Baldur's Gate 3 comes to PS5 on September 6. "We've decided to disable it for now to allow us to solve the issue in the interim. You shouldn’t notice anything in-game and Steam Cloud saves are unaffected by this change," Larian said.</p><p>The Baldur's Gate 3 update brings the game up to version 4.1.1.3624901. The game is riding high right now, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-passes-500000-players-on-pc-a-day-after-launch/1100-6516551/">surpassing 500,000 concurrent players. </a></p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-hot-fix-out-now-with-150-changes/1100-6516580/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> has many puzzles that you might encounter during your travels. One of these is in the Gauntlet of Shar. While not a trial in and of itself, it does lead to a unique reward. Our guide discusses the Baldur's Gate 3 Silent Library puzzle, as well as the Spear of Night and Dark Justiciar Helmet rewards.</p><h2>How to Solve the Silent Library Puzzle in Baldur's Gate 3</h2><p>The Baldur's Gate 3 Silent Library puzzle is in the lower-left section of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-gauntlet-of-shar-puzzle-guide/1100-6516517/"><strong>Gauntlet of Shar</strong></a>. The closest room is the Faith-Leap Trial, which requires you to jump despite barely seeing the outlines of ledges. As for the Silent Library itself, you'll notice a shimmering aura at the entrance. Once you go inside, you'll realize that a magic barrier automatically applies the silence status to your entire party.</p><h3>How to Defeat the Enemies in the Silent Library</h3><p>The Baldur's Gate 3 Silent Library is full of traps. Thankfully, the enemies have poor detection range. We began by having the party in sneak mode before ungrouping so we can reposition everyone. We had Astarion disarm a couple of nearby traps before getting ready to strike a target in close range. Since the others were still hiding, we managed to move them closer to other targets. For instance, our main character, a Monk, as well as Karlach, approached the Umbral Tremor and other Justiciar undead.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-silent-library-spear-of-night-justiciars-helmet-guide/1100-6516518/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><h2>With Oppenheimer in theaters now, here's a rundown of how Nolan's movies have fared at the box office</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4174639-screenshot2023-08-04at1.43.20pm.png" /><br /><h3><div class="zdcs-url-shortener-sticky"><i></i><span>0</span><i></i></div><p dir="ltr">Writer-director Christopher Nolan's newest film, the WWII-era drama Oppenheimer, is in theaters now. The movie, which stars Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer and focuses on the creation of the atomic bomb, is doing extremely well at the box office with more than $400 million in about two weeks. But how does it stack up against Nolan's 11 other films over the past two decades?</p><p dir="ltr">In this gallery, we're running through the box office results for all of Nolan's 12 years, dating back to his extremely low-budget debut, 1998's Following. After Following, Nolan made what many believe to be among his best films, Memento, and while it didn't make all that much money compared to his newer films, it helped put Nolan on the map.</p><p dir="ltr">He followed up Memento with a psychological thriller remake of the Norwegian movie Insomnia starring Al Pacino, Hilary Swank, and Robin Williams. After that, Nolan made a magician thriller called The Prestige starring Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman.</p><p dir="ltr">In 2005, however, Nolan entered a new stratosphere of success with the first of his three Batman movies, Batman Begins. He would go on to direct sequels The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises, which are his two most successful movies ever at the box office. Nolan's career has also included the time-bending film Tenet, which was released during the pandemic both in theaters and on HBO Max, as well as the war movie Dunkirk and the sci-fi film Interstellar. And who could forget Inception, Nolan's mind-mending movie about dreams? Check out the full gallery below to see how these movies did at the box office. All box office data comes from the website <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/?ref_=bo_nb_rl_mojologo">BoxOfficeMojo</a>, which is owned and operated by Amazon.</p><p dir="ltr">In total, Nolan's films have grossed more than $5 billion at the box office, making him one of the most successful movie directors in history.</p><p>Bear in mind, though, that box office success and critical reception do not necessarily go hand in hand. For more on how Nolan's movies were received by critics, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-christopher-nolan-movies-ranked-by-metacritic-score/2900-4748/">GameSpot's gallery of Nolan's best movies</a>, as ranked by Metacritic score.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>12. Following (1998) – $48,482</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4174640-screenshot2023-08-04at1.45.05pm.png" /><br /><h3><p>Produced on a reported budget of just $6,000, 1998's Following was Christopher Nolan's feature film debut. It was his lowest-rated movie in terms of Metacritic score at 60 and his worst-performing at the box office (of course). A crime-thriller, Following documents a young writer, played by Jeremy Theobald, who… follows people around London in an attempt to find inspiration for his writing. That's not what happens, though, and the man finds himself in London's criminal underbelly.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>11. Memento (2000) – $40,047,078</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4174641-screenshot2023-08-04at1.47.02pm.png" /><br /><h3><p>A psychological thriller starring Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Joe Pantoliano, Memento was a breakout movie for Nolan. Pearce plays a man suffering from anterograde amnesia, and must piece together clues from his past to find the person who killed his wife. $40 million at the box office is Nolan's second-lowest ever, but the movie was <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/03/memento-is-a-precise-twisty-delight-15-years-on/473973/">made on a $9 million budget</a> and it further helped Nolan make a name for himself.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>10. The Prestige (2006) – $109,676,311</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4174642-screenshot2023-08-04at1.48.11pm.png" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">The Prestige stars Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale as rival magicians in Victorian-era London. The magicians go back and forth and try to one-up each other, culminating in a showdown over a teleportation trick. It crossed $100 million at the box office, and marked the start of Nolan's professional working relationship with Bale, who would go on to play Batman in Nolan's three Batman films.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>9. Insomnia (2002) – $113,758,770</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4174652-screenshot2023-08-04at1.49.05pm.png" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">One of Nolan's lesser-known films, 2002's Insomnia was actually the director's first major studio movie, and it earned more than $100 million at the box office. The movie, which is a remake of a Norwegian film of the same name, tells the story of a crooked Los Angeles police detective, played by Al Pacino, put on assignment in Alaska to solve a murder. He's facing his own demons and all-day daylight in this eerie and memorable movie. The film also stars Hilary Swank, Martin Donovan, and Robin Williams.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>8. Tenet (2020) – $365,304,105</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4174653-screenshot2023-08-04at1.49.57pm.png" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">The COVID pandemic had a major impact on how movies were released, with many studios opting to launch their films day-and-date on streaming services. Nolan, a staunch supporter of the theatrical model, apparently had enough influence to convince the higher-ups at Warner Bros. to release Tenet in theaters. Unfortunately for Nolan, the movie--which stars John David Washington, Elizabeth Debicki, Kenneth Branagh, and Robert Pattinson--didn't get great reviews nor did it make the kind of money that some thought it might given Nolan's pedigree. Nolan criticized HBO Max, calling it the "worst streaming service." This would be Nolan's last film with Warner Bros., before shifting to Universal for Oppenheimer.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. Batman Begins (2005) – $373,672,993</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4174654-screenshot2023-08-04at1.51.02pm.png" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Nolan's career rose to new heights with 2005's Batman Begins, his first superhero movie. The film stars Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman, with an all-star supporting cast that includes Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy, Liam Neeson, and Morgan Freeman. The origin story tells the tale of how Bruce Wayne became Batman, and though it didn't get the highest reviews of Nolan's career or make the most money, it's regarded as a solid start to what would become a giant trilogy. Nolan's two ensuing Batman films would do better commercially and with critics.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. Oppenheimer (2023) – $425,311,505 (so far)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4174655-screenshot2023-08-04at1.51.34pm.png" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Nolan's newest movie, 2023's Oppenheimer, arrived on July 21 alongside Barbie and has so far gotten off to a hot start. In just about two weeks, the movie has cleared more than $400 million worldwide, making it Nolan's sixth-highest-grossing movie of all time. The film stars Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man who was key in the creation of the atomic bomb. Murphy starred in Nolan's other movies including Dunkirk, Inception, and Batman Begins, but this time, Murphy plays the lead role and has earned major praise for his performance as Oppenheimer.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. Dunkirk (2017) – $527,016,307</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4174656-screenshot2023-08-04at1.52.14pm.png" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Nolan's best movie according to critics, Dunkirk, is also one of his highest-grossing, surpassing $500 million. The movie tells the miraculous real-life story of the World War II evacuation of soldiers at Dunkirk. Filmed in Dunkirk itself, the film is known and celebrated for its use of practical effects and stunning cinematography. The movie stars Fionn Whitehead, Tom Glynn-Carney, Jack Lowden, Harry Styles, Barry Keoghan, Kenneth Branagh, and Mark Rylance.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. Interstellar (2014) – $773,430,538</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4174657-screenshot2023-08-04at1.53.17pm.png" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">A sci-fi epic set in the future, Interstellar stars Matthew McConaughey as an astronaut sent into a wormhole to try to save humanity. The problem, for McConaughey's character, is that each trip deep into space takes no time at all for him but spans decades for people back on Earth, which includes his loved ones. This was one of Nolan's highest-grossing movies of all time, pushing beyond three quarters of a billion dollars. The movie also stars Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain, and it's a real tear-jerker and mind-bender when it all wraps up.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. Inception (2010) – $870,792,649</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4174684-screenshot2023-08-04at1.55.40pm.png" /><br /><h3><p>Inception, released in 2010, involves a unique concept where agents infiltrate their targets' subconscious to get information and plant ideas. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Elliot Page, with a supporting cast that includes Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Michael Caine, and Ken Watanabe. It is fondly remembered for its striking visuals and thought-provoking story, with an ending that people still debate today. It's also one of Nolan's highest-grossing movies, raking in more than $870 million.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. The Dark Knight (2008) – $1,006,234,167</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4174685-screenshot2023-08-04at1.56.27pm.png" /><br /><h3><p>Nolan's second Batman movie, The Dark Knight, might be his most famous. The 2008 film brought on Heath Ledger to play The Joker in what continues to be among the best villain performances of all time. It was Nolan's first movie to crack $1 billion, ending its theatrical run with $1.006 billion.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. The Dark Knight Rises (2012) – $1,081,169,825</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4174687-screenshot2023-08-04at1.57.30pm.png" /><br /><h3><p>The Dark Knight Rises, released in 2012, wrapped up Nolan's run in the superhero space. Nolan was said to have been hesitant about coming back for a third, but he and co-writer David Goyer eventually found a story, featuring Tom Hardy as Bane and Anne Hathaway as Catwoman, that inspired Nolan to finish things off, and it paid off big time. The movie is Nolan's highest-grossing film of all time, bringing in $1.081 billion at the box office. Fans hoping Nolan might come back to make another superhero movie one day are out of luck, as Nolan recently said he's done with superhero films. But James Bond? That's a maybe.</p></h3></p><br />

<p>On the surface, it might seem like the map in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/">Baldur's Gate 3 </a>isn't too big, at least in Act 1. As you continue to explore, though, you have a chance of stumbling upon an entirely different world beneath the surface of the main map. This magical and brightly-colored area is called the Underdark, and it has its own inhabitants, environments, and questlines.</p><p>The Underdark is also required to visit Moonrise Towers and progress to Act 2, should you not want to go through the mountain pass. Luckily, there are a few different ways of entering the Underdark in Baldur's Gate 3, which you can see in the guide below.</p><h2>Entering the Underdark in Baldur's Gate 3</h2><p>In total, I have managed to discover four different ways of getting into the Underdark, at least so far.

<p>The Finish the Masterwork Weapon quest is a mission that's begun by simply reading a piece of paper behind a barrel inside of a broken-down house in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/">Baldur's Gate 3</a>. It's quite the peculiar start to a quest. However, this strange beginning leads to one of the most beautiful and dangerous locations in the entire game. You will have to find a piece of <strong>Sussar Tree Bark</strong> here, which is quite a difficult item to find if you don't know where to look. Sussar Tree Bark is required to craft the masterwork weapon and complete this side quest in Baldur's Gate 3, so check out the guide below to see how to find it.</p><h2>Finding Sussar Tree Bark</h2><p>For this quest, you will have to travel to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-all-of-the-ways-to-get-to-the-underdark/1100-6516586/">Underdark</a>. This is the subterranean location in Baldur's Gate 3, and it can be accessed in a few different ways. You can go through the Defiled Temple, use the Featherfall Spell to go down the spider's pit in the Whispering Depths dungeon, or go down the elevator at the Zhentarim Hideout. Regardless of how you do it, reaching the Underdark is the first step to finding the tree bark.</p><p>Once you're there, you want to reach the Sussar Tree waypoint, which is located on the far western side of the Underdark map.

<p>After years of development, Baldur's Gate 3 has finally launched on PC, and it's quickly putting up big numbers. On Steam, the game has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed">exceeded 400,000 concurrent players</a> just hours after launch. A day later, the figure has climbed above 500,000.</p><p>Larian boss Swen Vincke said the IT team at Larian was informed that they should expect about 100,000 or so at the maximum, so they are probably working hard to make sure things stay smooth for everyone.

<p>A new species of suckermouth catfish has been discovered in Africa, and scientists have named it after a popular Lord of the Rings character.</p><p>Researchers said in a study published recently in <a href="https://meridian.allenpress.com/copeia/article-abstract/111/3/376/494635/Two-New-Species-of-Suckermouth-Catfishes">Ichthyology &amp; Herpetology</a> that they found a new type of fish that has some similarities to Hobbits and specifically Frodo Baggins. The fish is called Chiloglanis frodobagginsi. It's a small, brown fish with brown spots on its back and whisker appendages.</p><p>Scientists named the fish after Frodo because the fish, like the character, is a "diminutive traveler," <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/tiny-species-named-lord-rings-210726533.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAG4UN554bClf5r3OQPk_VdctKTLeeeR03hT7L7tAJz3wvatM9wmwEdN9f7Tt2ZweQ2PVS7YIbhsggJL654JyQXD4yP0YH2n9GLH16nDfuKsZxsKqNl8gx6inEKdM6UyEHthWFPuYa5kkxN9BYbekuFmwdiFfVENuTuQcJuQsQvGN">according to Yahoo News</a>. Hobbits, of course, are known to be small in stature. Most are homebodies, but Frodo (and Bilbo) broke the mold and went on grand, unexpected adventures.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-fish-discovered-named-after-lord-of-the-rings-character/1100-6516583/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Back in 2020, The Office (US) star Leslie David Baker launched a Kickstarter for a spinoff themed around his character of Stanley Hudson, asking for a goal of $300,000. After several fans posted on <a href="https://twitter.com/pugmane/status/1685761183259717632">social media</a> wondering what exactly happened to the project, Baker announced that he's refunding the project's backers in part due to the ongoing WGA and SAG strikes.</p><p dir="ltr">The proposed spinoff was titled "Uncle Stan," and it would've followed Stanley as he came out of retirement to help his a nephew's "motorcycle/flower shop business" in Los Angeles. The Kickstarter ended up raising $336,450 according to its page, but Baker claims that the creators only received $110,629.81 from the platform, and he further said that they were "never used for any purposes other than reward fulfillment and backer refunds."</p><p dir="ltr">In a statement obtained by <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/the-office-actor-returns-fan-donations-stnaley-spinoff-1235687187/">Variety</a>, Baker said that the project initially stalled due to COVID lockdowns, but that "pre-production" has now been sidelined due to the dual strikes in Hollywood at the moment. He further stated that he intends to make the show once these situations are resolved, and that the Kickstarter fan rewards and perks will still be fulfilled at some point.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-office-star-says-hes-returning-all-kickstarter-donations-for-failed-spin-off/1100-6516581/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The Like a Dragon series--formerly Yakuza--is set to make a grand return in the near future with a new mainline entry, one that sees lovable knucklehead Ichiban Kasuga team up with the legendary Dragon of Dojima for a new adventure. Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth is the name of the game and a direct follow-up to Yakuza: Like a Dragon. We know, this naming convention is starting to get weird.</p><p>This new chapter comes hot on the heels of the Like a Dragon: Ishin remaster and the spin-off Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name that fills in a few gaps in the LAD timeline. While Sega and developer Ryu Ga Gotoku (RGG) have been keeping most of the details on the eighth mainline entry under wraps, some information has been revealed over the last couple of months since the game was officially announced. Here's a closer look at everything that we know so far about Infinite Wealth, from its returning cast to its tease of a new tropical location.</p><h2>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth platforms and release date</h2><figure style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4174468-ss2_1920.jpg"><img alt="Kiryu Kazuma has a stylish new look in Infinite Wealth." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4174468-ss2_1920.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Kiryu Kazuma has a stylish new look in Infinite Wealth.</figcaption></figure><p>RGG is aiming to launch Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth in "early 2024" for PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, and PS4.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-characters-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516578/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The PS5 has never received an outright discount at major retailers, but that'll change starting Sunday, August 6. Target's upcoming <a href="https://weeklyad.target.com/promotions?code=Target-20230806&amp;page=8">weekly ad</a> lists the <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/1804712/81938/2092?subId1=subid_value&amp;u=https://www.target.com/p/playstation-5-console/-/A-87716467">PS5 for $450</a>, which all but confirms a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-price-cut-coming-soon-for-a-limited-time-report-says/1100-6516197/">recent leak</a> that claimed the PlayStation 5 would be available for $50 off at major retailers August 6-19. Though other major retailers haven't confirmed the existence of the sale (and we don't have an official end date), it seems very likely you'll be able to get the PS5 for this price at stores such as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-5-Console-CFI-1215A01X/dp/B0BCNKKZ91?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://shop-links.co/1815865059169660169?u1=subid_value">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Sony-PlayStation-5-Video-Game-Console/1736740710">Walmart</a>.</p><p>If you're interested in this deal, you'll probably want to act fast when it goes live.

<p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> Halsin romance made the rounds all over the internet before launch.

Members have previously been able to access the early access version of Baldur's Gate 3, but with the official PC launch, the full game is now available and streamable through the service.</p><p>Additionally, games from Bethesda's best-known franchises will be joining the cloud this month, including DOOM, Quake, and Wolfenstein. Nvidia didn't reveal which titles specifically will be coming to the streaming service, but it did share a Wolfenstein: The New Order image in its blog post, so at least one game is confirmed right now.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-bethesda-games-and-more-arrive-on-geforce-now/1100-6516575/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>A movie based on the iconic board game Monopoly is seemingly back in development. Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks confirmed this as part of the <a href="https://investor.hasbro.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hasbro-sell-eone-film-tv-business-lionsgate">news</a> that Hasbro is selling its eOne film and TV business to Lionsgate for $500 million. The Monopoly movie has been in the works for nearly a decade, but in Hollywood, projects stop and start regularly.</p><p>"Lionsgate's management team is experienced in entertainment and adept at driving value, and we're glad to have found such a good home for our eOne film &amp; TV business," Cocks said. "We look forward to partnering with them, especially on a movie adaptation of Monopoly."</p><p>A Monopoly movie has been in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/now-theyre-making-a-monopoly-movie/1100-6428580/">various stages of development for years, dating back at least to 2015.</a> At one point, Kevin Hart and Ridley Scott were attached, but nothing has ever come of it. Given the incredible success of the Barbie movie recently, it seems possible that Hollywood executives might be more excited about the idea of even more toy-based movies.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-monopoly-movie-is-back-on-hasbro-confirms/1100-6516574/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
