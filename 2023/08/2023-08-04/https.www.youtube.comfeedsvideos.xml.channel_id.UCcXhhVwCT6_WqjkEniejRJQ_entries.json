We were saved by Jeremias, one of the visitors of the Wintergatan meetup who did a fantastic job turning the ID of the pulley for the tapered bushing. \n\nI learned alot from watching Jeremias work and my appreciation of the beauty of turning is\nThis was the first day of the wintergatan meetup so met a whole bunch of lovely people with great design suggestions. If you want to see more check back on the full livestreams from @Musikkabinett \n\nThanks for watching the series and see you tomorrow for episode 5 :)\n\nLego Kit! :)\n\nThe prototype is designed to answer the age old question: Can I play tight music using a very strong flywheel? The new flywheel have 20x more moment of inertia compared to the MMX Flywheel.\n\nWe are recording at the wonderful location of Siegfrieds Mechanical Music Museum in Rudesheim Am Rhein, Germany.
