To start my Bethesda bonanza we have Skyrim Is An Absolute Nightmare - This Is Why. Next is Fallout: New Vegas, then Starfield. 

Skyrim is one of my favorite games, and I tried to make this review similar to my older ones, as I found making my Disco Elsium review a bit stressful. 

I used ideas I used to use, like green screening myself into Skyrim, keeping sketches short and to the point, and reviewing other games within the Skyrim review. This time is was Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom and the Resident Evil 4: Remake. 

ENJOY
