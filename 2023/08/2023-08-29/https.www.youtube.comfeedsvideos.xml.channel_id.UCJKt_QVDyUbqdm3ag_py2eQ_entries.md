"Novelle Plus" by Laamaa, 1st at Assembly Summer 2023.
Art "My Cat is Broken" by Mielikki, 9th at Assembly Summer 2023.

Reuploaded for correct playback. MMX driver was not being used in the previous upload (which this track needs as told by Laamaa). I've kept the old upload alive (unlisted) so those interested can compare how different these can be if played back the wrong way. Link to the old upload here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODxavphbuLg

Impulse Tracker 2.14v5 and SB16 CT2230 (with CT1703-A DAC). Impulse Tracker MMX mode: filtered.
