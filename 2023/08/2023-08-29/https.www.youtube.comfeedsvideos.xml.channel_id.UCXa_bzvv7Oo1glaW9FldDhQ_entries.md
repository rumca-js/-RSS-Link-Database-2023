Developer Frozenbyte’s Trine series has cemented itself as one of the best games in the co-op space, and Trine 5 tries to build upon the merits of prior entries without introducing any radical changes to the established formula. And it works about as well as you’d expect to, though that also means that the game falls prey to the same criticisms that were presented with Trine 4. 

The story is extremely simple thanks to its fairy tale nature and the combat doesn’t really have much depth - but the core gameplay loop of switching between characters and solving increasingly tough puzzles remains an enjoyable affair through and through. It’s also a beautiful game with gorgeous art direction, and those who enjoyed Trine 4 or are looking for a fun co-op experience should definitely give this one a shot.
