<p>It's been nearly a year since Meta <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-avatars-metaverse-legs-vr-virtual-reality-facebook-instagram-whatsapp-190937062.html">announced at Connect 2022</a> that it would give its weird Caspar the Friendly Ghost-esque metaverse avatars some legs to make them appear slightly more human. The day of reckoning is almost upon us as Quest Home avatars now sport extra limbs in the latest beta version of the Quest software.</p><p>You won't see legs on your avatar when you look down, as <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-avatars-finally-get-legs-in/"><em>UploadVR</em></a> points out. They'll only be visible in third-person or when you're looking at a virtual mirror (much like in many first-person shooter games). This makes sense, as there's no leg tracking option on any current consumer virtual reality system. It means Meta doesn't have to worry too much about having accurate leg animations instead of, I don't know, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?

Starting today, those who receive a warning for violating the community guidelines will be able to take a training course designed to help them better understand how to steer clear of uploading videos that run afoul of YouTube's regulations. As long as they complete the course and don't violate the same policy within a 90-day period, YouTube will remove the warning from their account. In other words, they can go to detention to help avoid a suspension.</p><p>If they violate the policy for which they received the warning a second time in that roughly three-month window, YouTube will remove the video in question and slap the creator with a dreaded strike (which can jeopardize their chances of making a living from the platform).

<p>Panic is an odd little company. It started out in the late 1990s as an app developer, and in 2016 it pivoted to video game publishing with <em>Firewatch</em>, followed by <em>Untitled Goose Game</em> in 2019. Both of these were breakout indie hits, resulting in significant success for the developers and Panic itself. And then, in 2022, Panic debuted the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/playdate-review-indie-games-crank-170054294.html">Playdate</a>, a tiny yellow game console with a crank on the side and a monochromatic display.

Even more improbable (and this is technically a spoiler, but hell, it's also real life), he manages to hold his own in the racing world. The original story was already a dream marketing win for Nissan and Sony, but now the two companies can milk it once again to bolster the mythology of <em>Gran Turismo</em>.

<p>When TCL <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tcl-gave-its-color-paper-like-display-tech-an-upgrade-for-its-latest-tablets-170059809.html">first unveiled NXTPAPER</a>, it said that it was designed for tablets and e-readers — not smartphones. You can disregard that comment now, because the company just unveiled its first smartphone using that very display tech. The TCL 40 NXTPAPER models are budget-oriented devices that promise &quot;industry-leading eye comfort&quot; with mid- to low-range specs.&nbsp;</p><p>TCL has described NXTPAPER as a &quot;combination of screen and paper,&quot; noting that it offers 25 percent more contrast than typical E Ink displays, while being 65 percent more power efficient. Its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tcl-nxtpaper-display-e-ink-video-eye-protection-110057051.html">latest version</a> delivers up to 500 nits of brightness, and supposedly exceeds TÜV-certified levels of blue light reduction.

<p>Google has been letting Android users <a href="https://support.google.com/photos/answer/10694388?hl=en">set up locked folders</a> in the Photos app for quite some time, giving them the option to keep sensitive images and screenshots safe from prying eyes. Now, the tech giant has started rolling out an update for the app that allows users to back up their locked folders, so they can access files saved in them from any of their devices. In addition, users can now access <em>and</em> set up locked folders — a feature that started as a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-photos-locked-folder-feature-coming-to-non-pixel-smartphones-101058384.html">Pixel exclusive</a> — from the Photos app on iOS and the web.

<p>Snapchat has added a new generative AI feature to its app. Called “Dreams,” it’s in some ways similar to the company’s signature AR effects, known as lenses. But instead of real-time camera-based effects, the feature uses generative AI to remix users’ selfies into “fantastical images that transform their persona into new identities.”</p><p>The feature, which can be found in the app’s “memories” section, begins by asking users to take selfies showing their face at different angles. The app will then creates a series of eight images based on themes like “time travel” or “alternate universes.” Eventually, Snap says, users will be able to create Dreams that include their friends’ likenesses as well.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Dreams is the latest generative AI experiment from the company, which launched its MyAI chatbot earlier this year using OpenAI’s models.
