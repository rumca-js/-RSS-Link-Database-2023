<p>Google is bringing its Duet AI to Google Workspace, with features ranging from automatic summarization of documents to something you&rsquo;ll probably really appreciate: a virtual avatar that can attend meetings for you when you can&rsquo;t make it.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, Duet AI for Google Workspace is just for businesses right now, who will be asked to pay for it: $30 per user per month, the same price Microsoft charges for its own <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1661514/microsoft-365-copilot-is-microsofts-ai-powers-applied-to-work.html">Microsoft 365 Copilot</a> AI offerings for businesses.

<p>You&rsquo;ve very likely either come across or regularly work with PDF files. In our increasingly cross-platform world, the humble PDF file is becoming more useful than ever. And most of the time you can enjoy free software that allows you to read or comment on these files, but there may come a time when you need to edit them as well. That&rsquo;s where a PDF editor comes in.</p>



<p>The best PDF editors allows you to edit, create, alter, and convert PDF files just like you would with any other text document. Adobe Acrobat is the most famous and, historically speaking, the go-to option for most people. While it&rsquo;s excellent both in features and utility, it&rsquo;s also one of the most expensive options. In recent years a whole host of PDF editors have sprung up in order to provide less expensive alternatives.</p>

<p>The strength of laptops and MacBooks? Clearly their mobility. The handy devices make it possible to work, surf, or watch videos in a relaxed atmosphere even on the train, while traveling, or on vacation. But because very few of us are on the road non-stop, laptops don&rsquo;t spend much of their time in their intended field of competence beyond the desk and power socket &mdash; quite the opposite.</p>



<p>Notebooks often spend a large part of their lives at home. Most people plug their laptop into the socket at home, because then you don&rsquo;t have to bother with charging or discharging the battery at all. The same goes at work. Thus, the portable computer suddenly fulfils the role of a desktop PC or Mac without actually being designed for it.</p>



<p>Nowadays, laptop batteries are increasingly built into the notebook housing and cannot be replaced so easily

<p>For web services and PC programs alike, the vast majority of offerings cover one key function and their features are limited to this area: PDF editors handle PDFs, image editors edit image, and so on. On the one hand, this means that people who infrequently use a program will find it difficult to find their way around all the features. On the other hand, hardly anybody will download and install professional software in order to quickly edit or convert a file, given the potential costs and licensing concerns.</p>



<p>This is precisely where <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://www.tinywow.com&amp;xcust=2-3-2045690-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">TinyWow</a> comes into its own.

## Can ECC RAM be used in home PCs?

<p>ECC RAM (error correcting code) is a term that often makes PC users look enviously at server and workstation owners. It&rsquo;s a type of memory that, thanks to an extra chip, is able to detect and correct errors in real time before they cause damage.</p>



<p>This capability makes ECC RAM the first choice for systems where stability is paramount and data corruption must be avoided at all costs. But can ECC RAM also be used in a conventional computer? This is not an easy question to answer.</p>



<p>With AMD chips, ECC RAM is &ldquo;unofficially&rdquo; supported. That means it is not an advertised feature, but it is not excluded either. With Intel chips, however, things are more complicated: ECC RAM is only supported by a few models. The search for an ECC-capable motherboard can be difficult. </p>

## 12 simple, secret Windows shortcuts you probably donâ€™t know

<p>You can be a seasoned Windows user, but you may still not know every shortcut available. For example, earlier this month I learned a new keyboard shortcut I hadn&rsquo;t known before. It was so simple and obvious, yet felt like a complete secret until that moment.</p>



<p>I also discovered that there are a <em>whole lot more</em> I&rsquo;ve been sleeping on.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2033628/i-did-not-know-this-simple-windows-keyboard-shortcut-until-today.html">original tip</a> came via Twitter (now known as X) courtesy of Jen Gentleman, a Windows engineering team member at Microsoft.

## Intelâ€™s â€˜Meteor Lakeâ€™ CPU power will be controlled by AI

<p>Intel&rsquo;s Meteor Lake chip will certainly be used as an engine for specific AI tasks on the PC. But Intel is also applying AI to how the chip operates, too: specifically applying AI to how it manages power and transitions between active and low-power states.</p>



<p>In 2008, Intel&rsquo;s Centrino platform used a catchphrase to describe the company&rsquo;s power philosophy: HUGI, or Hurry Up and Get Idle. It was an acknowledgment that meeting the need for low-power processor necessitated getting all the work that needed to be done, done as quickly as possible. Then the processor could return to a low-power sleep state.</p>



<p>That hasn&rsquo;t changed. AI &mdash; coincidentally or not, often referred to as Intel&rsquo;s &ldquo;Centrino moment&rdquo; &mdash; is also factoring heavily into Meteor Lake&rsquo;s power management, Intel executives said at the H
