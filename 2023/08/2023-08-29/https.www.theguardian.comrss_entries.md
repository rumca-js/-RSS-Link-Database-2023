<p>A thriller of a cup tie ended with Salford reaching the Carabao Cup third round with a 9-8 victory on penalties, the hero proving to be Ossama Ashley.

A new variant, <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/382/bmj.p1964">BA.2.86 or “Pirola”</a>, has emerged that is causing <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/382/bmj.p1964">concern</a>.

<p>The Oscar-winner returns for more carnage in a rote, violent sequel, this time saving an idyllic Italian seaside town from baddies</p><p>If an actor’s career can be said to obey the same laws that govern physics, then Denzel Washington’s turn in the third big-screen Equalizer reboot (the Threequelizer!) represents the corresponding opposite reaction to his last role as the Lord Macbeth for Joel Coen. Washington brought a frailty and introspection to the Thane of Cawdor, played as a greying lion-runt with insecurities giving way to a corrosive bloodlust. As Robert McCall, the erstwhile marine and intelligence-agency ghost cleaning up the streets in his retirement, Washington gets the chance to refute the idea that the savage passage of years must eat away at a man. Yoked with that same weight of pre-geriatric regret, he’s now able to conquer it and win at life, his willingness to kill making him a hero rather than tragic figure.</p><p>With a superhuman physical fitness allowing him t

Could transcendental meditation have had anything to do with it?</p><p>By the time he died in 1984 of lung cancer aged only 35, Andy Kaufman had wrestled more than 400 women. One of those who grappled for three minutes in the ring with him, the mud wrestler Red Snapper (AKA Robin Kelly), says that his impulse to rumble in the ring was very sexual. This raises the possibility that the entertainer who claimed to be both the <a href="https://prowrestling.fandom.com/wiki/Andy_Kaufman#:~:text=Inspired%20by%20the%20theatricality%20of,personality%20based%20upon%20the%20characters">intergender wrestling champion of the world and women’s wrestling champion of the World</a> was sublimating his desires in spandex.

Let’s park sun-dried tomatoes, because, as Jacob Kenedy, chef-owner of <a href="https://www.boccadilupo.com/">Bocca di Lupo</a> in London, notes, they’re more a “standalone ingredient, so eat as is or chop and put through something”. Fresh, however, are in season now, and their quality will depend on where you live and where you’re buying them. “If I’m in a hot country, where they have really good tomatoes, I tend almost exclusively to use fresh, whether they’re for a salad, sauce or stew,” Kenedy says.

<p>Lack of respect shown to Jenni Hermoso reflects dismissive attitudes to female players in Europe and beyond</p><p>I was totally aghast when Luis Rubiales <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/21/luis-rubiales-kiss-outrage-spanish-football-fa-president-womens-world-cup-final-spain-jenni-hermoso">grabbed Jenni Hermoso’s head and kiss her on the mouth</a> as Spain collected their World Cup winners’ medals in Sydney. Yet if it was truly shocking to see such brazen behaviour unfold on the biggest stage, that moment was also, sadly, all too typical of the way women across the world are often treated in the game’s shadows.</p><p>Far too many players can tell you stories of organisations, clubs and coaches with seedy undertones. Over the years, playing in different countries, I’ve seen, heard and experienced enough not to be surprised by Rubiales’s audacity in thinking he could get away with it.

<p>For five years, documentary-makers followed the musician and politician as he attempted to challenge the country’s reigning autocratic leader</p><p>“I am not a criminal. I am a presidential candidate.” That’s Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu – AKA Bobi Wine – speaking from inside a police van, his face pressed to the bars after being arrested for the umpteenth time. Wine is a Ugandan pop superstar; his music has earned him the nickname “Ghetto President”. This intense, raw documentary, shot over five years, follows <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/01/bobi-wine-likens-uganda-election-to-a-war-and-a-battlefield">his attempt to become Uganda’s actual president</a> – challenging the long-reigning autocrat Yoweri Museveni.

<p>When civil war broke out in 2015, a leaky oil tanker in the Red Sea became a crisis point – triggering a nail-biting series of events that saw special negotiations between the Houthi rebels and Saudi-backed government, and the UN begging the public for help – and getting it from a bunch of US schoolchildren</p><p>Since 1988, the hulking form of the FSO Safer has floated in the Red Sea, receiving crude oil from the bountiful Marib oilfields of Yemen. For 30 years, the ship was a critical piece of infrastructure in Yemen’s booming oil industry, which at one time generated <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2013/cr13246.pdf">63%</a> of government revenue.</p><p>But the civil war broke out in 2014, and most of the Safer’s crew were forced to abandon ship, leaving behind its cargo: 1.1m barrels of oil.

<p>Addison Bethea was snorkelling off the Florida coast when she found herself fighting for her life. Her love of wildlife documentaries had taught her how to fend off a shark – but it was back on dry land that she really needed her courage</p><p>When Addison Bethea felt the tug on her leg, she thought it was her brother, Rhett, playing a prank. It was a hot Saturday afternoon and they were snorkelling off the Florida coast, scouring the seabed for scallops with a couple of Rhett’s friends. The shallow waters were familiar territory for the Betheas, born and raised in the state, but this was a novel experience for one of Rhett’s friends. “They were making jokes about sharks just to scare him,” Addison recalls.</p><p>The four had been swimming for 20 minutes or so when Addison felt something pulling at her right leg, strong enough to drag her beneath the surface. She and her brother had been passing the scallop bag back and forth all afternoon as they swam near Rhett’s new boat, jostlin

<p>People who stayed through last year’s occupation are now abandoning the city amid fears of a ‘Bakhmut 2.0’</p><p>Antonina Sanina, 75, had spent the last two nights hiding in the basement of her apartment block in Kupiansk. She had endured six and a half months of Russian occupation last year, but now the renewed shelling of the city had prompted her to abandon her home. “I couldn’t take it any more,” she said a few minutes after local volunteers had driven her to safety.</p><p>She said eight neighbours hid in the cellar with her as the Russians targeted what they thought, wrongly, was a barracks nearby. “You could barely sleep. It would be on and off. Then you’d just wake up and you wouldn’t know – was that an actual hit or was it a dream?” A day before she took flight, one civilian was killed and 11 injured in a daytime artillery strike on the city centre.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/29/holdouts-quit-kupiansk-after-renewed-russian-shelling-ukraine">Conti

<p>The Wagner leader seemed to have achieved the unthinkable: humiliating Putin and getting away with it. But had he really been forgiven – or was the Kremlin playing for time?</p><p>Last week, a plane in which the Russian mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin was supposed to be a passenger crashed. The Kremlin confirmed that the Wagner boss was among the dead.

What did surprise people was that the Wagner chief survived so long, when so many opponents of the Russian regime have met untimely deaths.</p><p>The Guardian’s Russian affairs reporter, Pjotr Sauer, tells Michael Safi how Prigozhin did not lie low in the final months of his life but continued to criticise the war in Ukraine and to run his lucrative business in Africa. Yet behind the scenes there are signs the Kremlin may have been silently working to ensure his financial
