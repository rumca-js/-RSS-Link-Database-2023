Because of that, it\u2019s fair to say that its world, graphical style, and mechanics aren\u2019t wholly original, but there are enough interesting twists in its 30-hour story to make for a rich and enjoyable experience of its own merit. This isn\u2019t just nostalgia fodder. That said, its twitchy combat can be difficult to get a handle on, and once you do, it only stays interesting for so long before its limited customization options make it start to feel just a little repetitive. That\u2019s made up for by a strong soundtrack, an approachable and endearing story, and a wide number of fun zones and boss fights that make this a trip worth taking.\n\n#IGN #Gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnJA2OlPuH8", "date_published": "2023-08-29T00:51:27.865825+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Ign - YouTube", "album": "Ign - YouTube", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/YnJA2OlPuH8/hqdefault.jpg"}]
