<p dir="ltr">Don't count on a District 9 sequel happening, especially anytime soon. Writer and director Neill Blomkamp seems rather uncertain about District 10 after coming off helming Gran Turismo for Sony.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/gran-turismo-movie-neill-blomkamp-1235575045/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Blomkamp was asked about Sony being involved with his District 9 sequel. The director responded affirmatively, as Sony distributed the original and is also behind Gran Turismo. That said, Blomkamp was vague after that.</p><p dir="ltr">"I don't know if it's getting made or not," he said about District 10.

Her design also incorporates some elements from the reboot series, including her necklace.</p><p>Players can buy the Tomb Raider bundle to unlock the Lara Croft operator, as well as the Mach-5 dual pistols, the Ice Axe melee weapon, and the Mythic Defender SMG. Her finishing move is called "Play for Sport." The bundle also comes with the Tomb Buggy vehicle skin, a Tomb Raider-themed loading screen, a sticker, and an emblem.

<p>Actor Liam Neeson has once again shared his thoughts on Star Wars fandom and the series overall. He said the series has a cult-like following and that the numerous films and TV shows that have been released over the years are diluting the franchise overall.</p><p>Speaking to Conan O'Brien, Neeson--who played the Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn in the prequels--said Star Wars "is a cult." He added: "There's so many movies and spin-offs, and I think, you're diluting the whole thing."</p><p>This is the second time this year that Neeson has weighed in on the Star Wars series. In February, he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/liam-neeson-says-the-magic-of-star-wars-has-been-taken-away-due-to-so-many-spin-offs/1100-6511629/">said something pretty similar</a>, stating, "There's so many spin-offs of Star Wars.

<p>Developer Mimimi has announced that Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew will be its final game, as the studio will be shutting down over the next couple of months. In a blog post, Mimimi explained that a variety of reasons led to its decision to close up shop, with the "increased financial pressure and level of risk" in producing a video game being a big factor. As Mimimi explained, crafting any video game requires an extraordinary amount of energy and passion, resources that ultimately pulled developers away from their loved ones and families.</p><p>"Making these games was amazing and extremely taxing at the same time. Reaching the level of quality Mimimi strives for is hard and requires focus and dedication," studio founders <a href="https://www.mimimi.games/our-final-game/">Dominik Abe and Johannes Roth wrote</a>, less than two weeks after the launch of Shadow Gambit.</p><p>"We also have to acknowledge that our future production costs are growing faster than potential revenues of our
