		<em>By Philipp Pointner, Chief of Digital Identity at <a href="https://www.jumio.com">Jumio</a></em>

In a world where identity theft and fraud are fast-growing threats, it’s more important than ever to confirm the identity of the people and organizations we interact with online. Whether you’re buying or selling a property, opening a new bank account, or starting a new job, it’s essential to ensure the security and integrity of your personal information.

As we move rapidly into a digital economy, all players must be clear on the rules – especially where remote identity verification is becoming the new norm.

		September 22 is coming quickly for Quebec employers. That is the day when the Canadian province's biometric information guidelines go fully into force.

Two business associations who will be fielding many questions about the guidelines, the Society for Human Resource Management and privacy-professionals group, the IAPP, are publishing reminders. The guidelines will be enforced by the Commission on Access to Information.

		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/neurodactyl">Neurodactyl</a>, a Georgia-based tech startup specializing in contactless fingerprint recognition, has unveiled a new biometric deduplication tool that quickly identifies errors and duplicates in large-scale biometrics databases.

A distinctive feature is its direct all-to-all matching, where every fingerprint is compared to every other in the database, regardless of finger position.

In practical terms, for a database containing ten million people and 100 million fingerprints, this translates to a staggering five quadrillion matching operations. Neurodactyl’s deduplication algorithm uses neural networks to create compact biometric templates that can be quickly matched, according to the company announceme

		Kuwaiti authorities say more than one million persons have now submitted their fingerprint biometrics as the project to set up a central biometric database in the country continues.

As <a href="https://timeskuwait.com/news/more-than-a-million-citizens-residents-have-taken-the-biometric-fingerprint/">The Times</a> Kuwait reports, the growing figures show compliance with the directive as work to simplify and improve the enrollment system continues.

The government has set up several enrollment centers at shopping malls and airports for those who are yet to have their fingerprints captured.

There is no announced deadline for the fingerprinting exercise, which involves Kuwaiti citizens and expatriates living in the country who are 18 years of age and above.
