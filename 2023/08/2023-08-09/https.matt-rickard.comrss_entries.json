It\u2019s a fundamental concept in probability theory. The formula can be expressed as:\n\nP(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)\n\nWhere:\n\n * P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B.\n * P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A.\n * P(A) is the prior probability of event A.\n * P(B) is the total probability of event B.\n\nSome examples of Bayes Rule in real life.\n\nMedical Diagnostics:\n\n * P(A): Probability", "link": "https://matt-rickard.com/bayes-rule", "date_published": "2023-08-09T13:30:46+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}]
