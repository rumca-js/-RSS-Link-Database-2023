Mixing real but stolen identity data with manufactured data to carry out fraud is known as synthetic identity fraud. After opening the allegedly fraudulent accounts, Wells Fargo could obtain confidential information from credit reporting and risk management agency Early Warning.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the bank laundered money, using the accounts to secretly process the transfer of electronic funds. It further alleges Early Warning provided fraudulent identity verification to give the accounts the appearance of validity. Wells Fargo and Early Warning deny the claims.\n\nWells Fargo has had <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/201604/wells-fargo-mobile-biometric-authentication-application-wins-banking-industry-award\">biometric authentication apps</a> available for corporate clients since 2016.

In both cases, a company employee escorted passengers through security who were not enrolled in the Clear program and without checking their IDs.\n\nOne instance was discovered when an erroneously escorted passenger noticed their boarding pass was for a different airport. In the other, a person used a discarded boarding pass to clear security.\n\nA United States congressional aide said neither person boarded a plane, according to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/07/transpo-clear-tsa-00110124\">Politico</a>.\n\nSome members of Congress want the Transportation Security Administration to require that all Clear subscribers present IDs to an airport TSA agent.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/clear\">Clear</a>'s business model is prescreening customers who pay a $189 subscription for the privilege of not standing in TSA's snaking manual authentication lines. Instead, they can offer a fingerprint or iris biometrics scan and shave a great deal of time of time in a busy airport.\n\nThe TSA notified Clear in early June that subscribers would need to present IDs after a 30-day notice and comment period. The agency is evaluating those comments.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/clear-spars-over-tsa-report-after-security-incident-follows-enrollment-error\">Clear</a> has had similar problems before, with one subscriber in 2022 almost boarding a flight under a fake identity.

The patent application describes how its devices can be equipped with an emissive display that transmits light into the camera sensors, allowing them to get rid of holes in the display.\n\nUnder-display cameras already exist in smartphones such as those made by Samsung and ZTE. Google\u2019s version, however, is intended to maximize camera quality by introducing deliberate light-blocking elements and distortions. Google lays out how it can improve photo and video quality by using two parts of the display with different shapes and patterns to block or distort the light while it passes through the screen.

EMVCo intends for the requirements to help developers of MFA solutions for payments, laboratories and the issuers, merchants, acquirers and payment providers who make up the rest of the payments ecosystem.\n\n\u201cAs remote payments continue to gain traction, such as e-commerce transactions, it is paramount for consumers to be able to securely prove their identity and authenticate their transactions,\u201d explains Joy Huang, chair of the EMVCo Executive Committee. \u201cEMVCo recognises that MFA plays a crucial role in not only achieving this, but also giving the industry flexibility in how it wants to authenticate consumers using different credential combinations in different payment scenarios.\u201d\n\nStipulations from EMVCo include 17 guidelines for authentication processing, all stated in broad terms to allow the flexibility Huang refers to.\n\nThe framework\u2019s guidance on avoiding weak authentication factors states: \u201cBiometric modalities or implementations with high false-positive rates, susceptible to presentation attacks or any type of attack that can lead to wrong user verification\u201d as an example of what not to use.\n\nThe use of biometric systems for other functions, such as device unlocking, can also decrease the security of an MFA solution making use of it, by providing an opportunity for attackers to identify vulnerabilities.\n\nThe guidance is intended to build on existing security frameworks and standards, including those from NIST, the FIDO Alliance, PSD2, and the EMVCo\u2019s own <a href=\"https://www.emvco.com/processes/software-based-mobile-payment-evaluation-process/\">Security Evaluation Infrastructure</a>.\n\nA recent EMVCo blog post also identified remaining <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/emvco-payment-association-eu-weigh-in-on-biometric-payment-card-challenges\">challenges to biometric payment card adoption</a> at scale, as production prices drop.", "link": "https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/emvco-sets-mfa-security-guidelines-with-encouragement-and-cautions-for-biometrics-use", "date_published": "2023-08-09T17:44:44+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/biometricupdate", "title": "SecureAuth behavioral biometrics, passwordless authentication built into Citrix platform", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"1367\" src=\"https://d1sr9z1pdl3mb7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/20141607/tablet-in-use-scaled.jpg\" width=\"2048\" />\n\t\tIdentity and access management company <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/secureauth\">SecureAuth</a> will provide its authentication platform to Citrix Workspace, a digital workspace software platform developed by U.S. cloud computing and virtualization company <a href=\"https://www.citrix.com/\">Citrix Systems</a>.\n\nCitrix Workspace will seamlessly integrate SecureAuth's passwordless identity solution Arculix while the two companies plan to offer it on Citrix Ready Marketplace.

One of its targets is Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nTuesday, a delegation led by Hassel Bacchus, minister of digital transformation for the Caribbean country, met with representatives from India's Ministry of Electronics and IT.\n\nIndian officials have been <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/india-uses-g20-presidency-to-champion-global-south-and-digital-public-infrastructure\">using its G20 presidency</a> to promote their vision for digital public infrastructure, which includes the India Stack -- <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202302/social-protection-lessons-indian-interoperability-opportunities-for-private-sector\">platforms</a> designed to provide Indian citizens with access to government services based on their Aadhaar ID.\n\nAccording to <a href=\"https://government.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/digital-india/meity-to-implement-india-stack-solutions-for-trinidad-tobago/102516362\">reports</a> from business news publisher Economic Times , the India delegation discussed in detail aspects of the stack, including the nation's unique identifier Aadhaar, Unified Payments Interface and DigiLocker wallet.\n\nIndia\u2019s model for digital public infrastructures has <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/indias-account-aggregator-dpi-could-promote-equitable-financial-access-world-bank\">been applauded</a> by numerous organizations such as the World Bank. That is despite the bank's government emissary to the G20 group of finance ministers, Amitabh Kant, <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/india-presses-for-legal-framework-to-guide-adoption-of-digital-public-infrastructure\">maintains</a> that India's vision needs defining and a legal framework to guide its deployment.\n\nDeveloped economies have reportedly <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202304/indias-digital-public-infrastructure-reportedly-not-as-popular-with-g7-nations\">expressed less interest</a> in adopting the stack. But many of the rest of the world's economies, where many people still lack IDs, have been taking notes on India\u2019s lessons.\n\nThis year, India signed agreements with <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/7-countries-partner-with-india-to-adopt-its-digital-public-infrastructure-model\">multiple</a> <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/india-expands-partnership-on-digital-public-infrastructure-experience-sharing-at-g20\">countries</a> to share aspects of its public infrastructure work, including <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/papua-new-guinea-to-tap-indias-digital-public-infrastructure-experience\">Papua New Guinea</a>, <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/india-expands-partnership-on-digital-public-infrastructure-experience-sharing-at-g20\">Armenia and Sierra Leone</a>.\n\nTrinidad and Tobago, which has a sizable community of people of Indian descent, has been making its own <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202007/digital-identity-initiatives-for-government-services-see-a-mix-of-progress-and-delay\">digital identity plans</a>.

This was as he emphasized the importance of a new digital ID system for the country.\n\nRecently, information surfaced that there was an outstanding debt of 184 million Kenyan Shillings (US$1.2 million) owed to the project, which is what has now prompted the MPs to press for an audit.\n\nThe Huduma Namba was apparently conceived with good intentions, but its execution turned out to be <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202201/kenya-pushes-on-with-huduma-namba-as-compulsory-digital-id-amid-controversy\">highly controversial</a>, facing many challenges including lawsuits alleging rights violations and exclusion.\n\nAlthough the current Kenyan Administration is already far advanced with plans of replacing the Huduma Namba with a new digital ID system, the representatives of the people think the facts must be established on how huge sums of tax payers\u2019 money were spent on the project, and whether it brought them any value.\n\nThe special audit is expected to be conducted by the Office of the Auditor-General Nancy Gathungu.\n\nWith the visible failures of the Huduma Namba, there have been calls from advocacy groups for the government to <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/nubian-rights-forum-urges-equitable-rollout-to-kenyas-upi-system\">guard against the same mistakes</a> that bedevilled the project as it looks to implement a new one.\n<h2>Calls for halt to hospital biometric system rollout</h2>\nPlans by Kenya\u2019s National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) to deploy a biometric system have been panned by members of the National Assembly, who say the Sh4.2 billion ($29 million) price tag is too high, <a href=\"https://www.pd.co.ke/news/lawmakers-reject-sh4-2b-biometric-system-for-nhif-195297/\">People Daily</a> reports.\n\nNHIF Chief Executive Samson Kuhora says the current system cost SH1.6 million ($11 million), but leaves gaps leading to practical problems.\n\nAn NHIF card used for access to health services was <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/kenya-factors-in-biometrics-in-three-year-digital-government-plan\">discontinued</a> earlier this year, and recent audits have revealed mismatched hospital records and negative impacts on patients.\n\nMPs from the Committee on Health argue that the government cannot afford the project due to a weak economy.", "link": "https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/kenyan-lawmakers-seek-probe-into-flopped-huduma-namba-digital-id-project", "date_published": "2023-08-09T15:23:37+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/biometricupdate", "title": "Nigeria signs MOU on biometric cards for payments in healthcare, agriculture", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"1367\" src=\"https://d1sr9z1pdl3mb7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/19172639/patient-digital-identity-scaled.jpg\" width=\"2048\" />\n\t\tNigeria is set to enhance and modernize its digital payments infrastructure, particularly in the healthcare and agriculture sectors, after a federal government agency concluded a deal with a biometric technology company.\n\nThe National Space Research and Development Agency (NASRDA) recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with <a href=\"https://egatetechnology.com/\">eGate Technology</a> to deploy technologies including artificial intelligence for payments, electronic medical records, hospital management and tele-medicines, among others, The Nation <a href=\"https://thenationonlineng.net/nasrda-signs-agreement-with-egate-technology-for-digital-transformation-in-healthcare-agriculture/\">reports</a>.\n\nSpeaking during the signing ceremony, NASRDA\u2019s Director General Halilu Ahmad said the partnership will improve and streamline access to services and enhance efficiency.\n\nPer the deal, eGate\u2019s solution will provide biometric smart payment cards which will be integrated with existing payment facilities to facilitate payments for citizens. The partners say this will, among other things, help eliminate delays and reduce fraud. It will also ease the process of application for loans or purchases of farm inputs such as fertilizers, while also making it possible for people to undertake medical consultations remotely.\n\n\u201ceGate Technology is leading the way in digital transformation in the region. We believe that digital transformation will improve population access to services management, to increase efficiency, reduce costs and frond transactions, improve data security and privacy, and provide decision makers with statists report for accurate decision at the right time,\u201d says Essam Elsaghir, eGate Technology chairman, as quoted by The Nation.\n\nTheir commitment, the official said, is to provide \u201ca fully integrated digital identity smart card system\u201d that will \u201ccreate biometric digital identity to identify citizens and their electronic profiles with financial facility to receive money or do any type of payment \u201cwhich will increase efficiency, ease access to services, and reduce problems like misidentification and fraud.\u201d\n\nUsers will be able to access the different services using a mobile app, the technology provider says.\n\nIn the meantime, the NASRDA deal with eGate involves GS Group, a Smart Road and RFID provider, <a href=\"https://www.thecable.ng/nasrda-signs-agreement-with-gs-group-egate-technology-to-digitalise-traffic-management\">The Cable</a> notes.\n\n\u201cToday we are honoured to be selected to implement our state-of-the-art RFID technology and intelligent traffic management system with country footprint infrastructure that poses many critical challenges in most modern cities, including congestion, traffic violations, car theft, and illegal vehicles,\u201d says Gaseer Elsayed, founder of GS Group.\n\nThese digital transformation initiatives come as the government says there is progress in enrollment for the national digital ID program. The number of those with the National Identification Number (NIN) has now reached 101.64 million, New Telegraph reports.\n\nFigures from the National Identity Management Commission (<a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/national-identity-management-commission-nimc\">NIMC</a>) indicate that 634,603 enrollments were recorded in July, which is a drop from the one million monthly registrations in the past several months.", "link": "https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/nigeria-signs-mou-on-biometric-cards-for-payments-in-healthcare-agriculture", "date_published": "2023-08-09T15:16:55+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}]
