If you're a more graphical sort of person, you might want to add support for your app store:\n\nFOr GNOME software, the package is often called gnome-software-plugin-flatpak, and for Discover on KDE, it's generally plasma-discover-flatpak.\n\nNext, you'll need to add a repo to be able to install flatpaks easily, without downloading a file manually each time. The biggest one everyone should use is FLathub, it has virtually every flatpak ever made.\n\nsudo flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo\n\nTHEMING:\n\nThere are a bunch of themes available on Flathub, that you can find typing\n\nflatpak search theme\n\nIf the theme you use is in there, you can just install it from here, then, you select it in GNOME Tweaks, and you run:\n\nflatpak update\n\nIf your theme isn't available from Flathub, though, you'll need to tell flatpak it needs to use your specific theme. To do this, you can either run a command, or use a graphical application.\n\nsudo flatpak override --env=GTK_THEME=NAME OF YOUR THEME.\n\nBut that's not enough, we also need to give flatpak access to the directory where your themes are located, namely the .themes directory:\n\nsudo flatpak override --filesystem=$HOME/.themes\n\nFor GTK4/Libadwaita apps, open your .bash-profile file in your home directory. At the end, add this line:\n\nexport GTK_THEME=NAMEOFYOURTHEME\n\nSave the file, and then log out and log back in for all the changes we made to be applied. All your GTK apps should now use the right theme, whether they're using libadwaita, flatpak, or both.\n\nPERMISSIONS\n\nNow let's see how you can change permissions. To manage them, you can use Flatseal on GNOME and KDE, but KDE also has a permissions page in the settings.\n\nGenerally, permissions are correctly set, but if you feel an app shouldn't have access to something, you can toggle that thing off, and if you feel an app SHOULD have access to something, you can toggle it ON.\n\nBROWSER INSTALL\n\nInstalling flatpaks is just a one click operation from your graphical app store, but if you like to browse for apps in your web browser, you can also start an install straight from there.\n\nThere's an extension for Firefox and CHromium based browsers called Flatline. \n\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/flatline-flatpak/?ref=itsfoss.com\n\nhttps://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/flatline/cpbniogoilfagmcoipghkgnpmdglfmjm\n\nCOMMAND LINE BASICS:\n\ninstall:  flatpak install APPNAME\n\nUninstall: flatpak remove APPNAME\n\nUpdate: flatpak update\n\nCleanup: flatpak uninstall --unused\n\nList installed flatpaks: flatpak list\n\nSearch for flatpaks: flatpak search\n\nRun an app: flatpak run COMPLETE_APPNAME\n\nKill an app: flatpak kill COMPLETE_APPNAME\n\nRepair: flatpak repair", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYXlgzrZRIE", "date_published": "2023-08-09T16:03:53+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/IYXlgzrZRIE/hqdefault.jpg"}]
