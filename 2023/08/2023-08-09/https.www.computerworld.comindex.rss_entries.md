<p>Slack has added a range of new features to its collaboration app since its <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3532800/slack-targets-non-tech-users-with-ui-design-tweaks.html">last redesign three years ago</a>. And while these features — such as Huddles voice and video calls, Canvas documents, and Connect channels — have added functionality for users, the app has become somewhat cluttered, with a growing list of tabs along the left-hand sidebar.</p><p>With that complexity in mind, Slack has again revamped its software to simplify the user experience across the desktop, mobile and web versions. The changes will begin rolling out to users today.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3704391/slack-redesigns-app-to-tackle-growing-complexity.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>Psst: Come close. Your Android phone has a little-known superpower — a futuristic system for bridging the physical world around you and the digital universe on your device. It's one of Google's best-kept secrets. And it can save you tons of time and effort.</p><p>It's a little somethin' called Google Lens, and it's been lurking around on Android and quietly getting more and more capable for years. Google doesn't make a big deal about it, weirdly enough, and you really have to go out of your way to even realize it exists. But once you uncover it, well, you'll feel like you have a magic wand in your pocket.</p><p>At its core, Google Lens is best described as a search engine for the real world. It uses artificial intelligence to identify text and objects both within images and in a live view from your phone's camera, and it then lets you learn about and interact with those elements in all sorts of interesting ways. But while Lens's ability to, say, identify a flower, look up a book, or give you info about a landmark is certainly impressive, it's the system's more mundane-seeming productivity powers that are far more likely to find a place in your day-to-day life.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3572639/google-lens-android.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
