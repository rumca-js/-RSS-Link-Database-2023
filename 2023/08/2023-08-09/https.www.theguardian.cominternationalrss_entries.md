## ‘She’s hard to pin down’: the ‘avant-garde It girl’ who became a revolutionary photographer

<p>Tina Modotti moved in the same circles as Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo but, until now, little was known of the artist and activist whose work was galvanised by her politics</p><p>One morning in the mid-90s, the art historian Patricia Albers and her husband drove out to a farm in Oregon, looking for clues that would bring her closer to a woman she had encountered a decade before. She had been perusing an exhibition celebrating the work of California photographer <a href="https://www.edward-weston.com/">Edward Weston</a>, yet, wandering through the gallery space, it was the photographs of his Italian lover and protege, taken in Mexico in the 1920s, that especially piqued her interest. Who was she, Albers wondered? However, Tina Modotti wasn’t so easy to find. It would take years of detective work for Albers to locate the missing fragments that would bring her <a href="https://www.whsmith.co.uk/products/shadows-fire-snow-the-life-of-tina-modotti/patricia-albers/paperback/9780520235144.html">subsequent biography</a>, which was published in 1999, to life.</p><p>“Modotti lived in eight different countries so it’s hard to fit all the pieces together into a coherent whole,” Albers says from her home in California. That is why her discovery in 1994 of a trunkful of Modotti’s letters and photographs, in a dusty attic in Oregon, was such a pivotal moment. While researching her book, Albers’ sleuthing led her to the family of Modotti’s first partner, the American poet Roubaix “Robo” de L’Abrie Richéy, and to a musty trove that contained more than 100 images by the Italian photographer, mostly small contact prints that had been gifts to Robo’s family. “It was like going through her desk drawers, it had an aroma of the past,” Albers recalls. It also gave her the archival material she needed to finally tell her story.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/aug/09/tina-modotti-the-revolutionary-photographer-who-was-more-than-just-an-it-girl">Continue reading...</a>

## Lost on Me by Veronica Raimo review – a wryly comic coming-of-age

<p>This novel about a young woman growing up in a dysfunctional family in Rome is a gleeful dance between truth and fiction</p><p>Originally published in Italy as Niente di Vero, or “Nothing True”, Veronica Raimo’s autofictional fourth novel comes garlanded with praise and prizes. The story of a young woman growing up in Rome in a dysfunctional family who goes on to become a writer, it’s cruder and more slippery than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/fleabag">Fleabag</a>, funnier but less insightful than Deborah Levy’s “living autobiographies”, and ultimately frustrating for the way in which its author, for all her startling candour, somehow eludes our gaze.</p><p>We first meet not Veronica, but her parents, via their neuroses: a mother whose clear favourite is her son Christian (Raimo does have a brother called Christian, also a writer) and who requires near-constant telephone contact with both her children; a father who subdivides their tiny apartment in Rome by throwing up more and more internal walls and whose obsession with germs leads him to wipe everything down with alcohol – including his kids. The voice of the novel’s narrator – known as Verika, Vero, Oca, Scarafona, Smilzi and a host of other names – is wry and detached, often knowingly droll, as though she is sitting at a bar and telling you her story in disarranged fragments, each one polished to become a “bit”. We follow as she jumps about in time through a childhood marked by constipation, flashers, parental anxiety and shared boredom, and on into an adolescence in which subterfuge of various kinds becomes a necessary form of psychological escape. We learn that as an adult, she is a child-free writer and translator who has spent a lot of time in Berlin, as Raimo has, and are given glimpses – largely absurdist, but occasionally poignant – of heartbreak, an abortion and her father’s death.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/09/lost-on-me-by-veronica-raimo-review-a-wryly-comic-coming-of-age">Continue reading...</a>
