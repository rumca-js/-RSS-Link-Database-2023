The voice of the novel\u2019s narrator \u2013 known as Verika, Vero, Oca, Scarafona, Smilzi and a host of other names \u2013 is wry and detached, often knowingly droll, as though she is sitting at a bar and telling you her story in disarranged fragments, each one polished to become a \u201cbit\u201d. We follow as she jumps about in time through a childhood marked by constipation, flashers, parental anxiety and shared boredom, and on into an adolescence in which subterfuge of various kinds becomes a necessary form of psychological escape. We learn that as an adult, she is a child-free writer and translator who has spent a lot of time in Berlin, as Raimo has, and are given glimpses \u2013 largely absurdist, but occasionally poignant \u2013 of heartbreak, an abortion and her father\u2019s death.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/09/lost-on-me-by-veronica-raimo-review-a-wryly-comic-coming-of-age\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/09/lost-on-me-by-veronica-raimo-review-a-wryly-comic-coming-of-age", "date_published": "2023-08-09T11:00:23+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "Hoodies sell out in Tonga as El Ni\u00f1o brings wintry chill", "description": "<p>Residents on island rush to buy warm clothing and heaters amid unusually cold winter weather for the Pacific nation</p><p>Tonga is bracing for more chilly weather as the Pacific nation shivers through one of its coldest winters ever, sparking a rush for jackets and heating units.</p><p>The island has experienced unusually cold weather through July and Tonga Meteorological Services (TMS) recorded a low of 9.3 degrees Celsius at the Lapaha village weather station at the end of the month.
