So a bunch of sega emails from 1996 leaked. In preparation for a video I plan on working on some day I knew I had to go over these 200+ documents, but I didn’t want to do it alone.

So I livestreamed it.

Turns out, 2 hour long livestreams aren’t everybody’s cup of tea, so I’ve cut out an hour and 40 minutes so you can get the “highlights” of this “stream”.

Or something like that.
