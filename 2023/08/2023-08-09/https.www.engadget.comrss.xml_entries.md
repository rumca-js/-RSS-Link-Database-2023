<p>President Joe Biden signed an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/08/09/president-biden-signs-executive-order-on-addressing-united-states-investments-in-certain-national-security-technologies-and-products-in-countries-of-concern/">executive order</a> that puts new limits on American investment in certain types of Chinese tech firms. The order is meant to address national security concerns posed by companies that deal with “sensitive technologies,” including semiconductors, quantum computing and artificial intelligence.</p><p>&quot;Advancements in sensitive technologies and products in these sectors will accelerate the development of advanced computational capabilities that will enable new applications that pose significant national security risks, such as the development of more sophisticated weapons systems, breaking of cryptographic codes, and other applications that could provide these countries with military advantages,&quot; the executive order <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/08/09/executive-order-on-addressing-united-states-investments-in-certain-national-security-technologies-and-products-in-countries-of-concern/">states</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The White House described the move as “narrowly targeted,” saying it was meant to bar the funding of “entities that engage in specific activities related to these technology areas that pose the most acute national security risks.” As <em>The Washington Post</em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/08/09/china-ban-technology-biden-military/">notes</a>, responsibility for enforcing the executive order would fall on the Treasury Secretary.</p><p>The executive order, which won’t go into effect until 2024, is hardly the first time the US has sought to limit the influence of Chinese tech firms in recent years. Both Biden and his predecessor imposed significant restrictions <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-government-cracks-down-exports-tech-huawei-125040916.html"><ins>on Huawei</ins></a>. The White House has also limited the sale of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-trade-restrictions-chinese-miitary-ai-supercomputer-companies-082453795.html"><ins>supercomputing technology</ins></a> to Chinese firms and sought to block China’s access to advanced <a href="http://v/"><ins>chip-making</ins></a> equipment. The Biden Administration has also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-us-government-is-trying-to-force-bytedance-to-sell-tiktok-005751763.html"><ins>pressured ByteDance</ins></a>, the Chinese owner of TikTok, to sell the popular app.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/biden-signs-executive-order-restricting-investment-in-chinese-tech-companies-230728855.html?src=rss

## Threads now lets you share posts directly to Instagram DMs

<p>As Elon Musk <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-says-he-might-need-surgery-before-any-cage-fight-with-mark-zuckerberg-154237731.html">awaits his doctor’s permission</a> to fight Mark Zuckerberg in an on-again / off-again <a href="https://www.engadget.com/get-ready-for-a-zuck-vs-musk-cage-fight-100611527.html">cage match</a>, the two billionaires’ companies continue to spar in the consumer adoption arena. Meta forged ahead with Threads’ aggressive update schedule today as it tries to challenge Musk’s erratic X (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitters-rebrand-to-x-could-worsen-its-legal-and-financial-problems-233914973.html">rebranded Twitter</a>). Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.threads.net/@zuck/">announced</a> today that the young platform now supports sharing posts to Instagram DMs, custom alt text for photos and videos and a new mention button.</p><p>The Send on Instagram option lets users publish their Threads posts directly to Instagram DMs via the Send button. The feature could be seen as one of the “retention-driving hooks” Meta cooked up to ensure “people who are on the Instagram app can see important Threads,” as <em>Reuters</em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/meta-plans-retention-hooks-threads-more-than-half-users-leave-app-2023-07-28/">reported</a> Chief Product Officer Chris Cox said in a recent company meeting. The strategy is allegedly tied to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/threads-users-are-already-spending-less-time-in-the-app-182738755.html">reports of falling engagement</a> after the fledgling platform <a href="https://www.engadget.com/metas-threads-races-to-100-million-users-in-under-a-week-070740016.html">added over 100 million users</a> in less than a week. Zuckerberg reportedly described the decline as “normal” and expected retention to grow as Meta continues to flesh out the social channel, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/metas-instagram-linked-twitter-rival-threads-could-arrive-on-july-6th-063129168.html">launched</a> in early July.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Three screenshots showing the Meta Threads app's new alt-text feature. left: images, center: blank alt text, right: drafting alt text." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/cbfb09c0-36ed-11ee-9fff-6c4db0ec6a33" style="height: 1080px; width: 1800px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Meta</div></figure><p>Meanwhile, the custom alt-text option is an accessibility feature allowing Threads users to add (or edit existing auto-generated) alt text for photos and videos before uploading. The new mention button makes it easier to tag profiles in your Threads posts. Finally, the platform is making it easier to verify your identity on fediverse platforms like Mastodon. “You can now add your Threads profile link on supported platforms to verify your identity,” Instagram head Adam Mosseri <a href="https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/Cvu2fDiLZve">posted</a> today.</p><p>These are only the latest additions Meta has rolled out in the past few weeks. It announced earlier this month that a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/threads-is-getting-a-web-version-and-a-search-function-in-the-next-few-weeks-101220107.html">much-needed web version</a> is on the way, offering desktop use for the first time, along with a proper search function. Other post-launch additions include a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/threads-adds-a-chronological-feed-as-twitter-burns-to-the-ground-152817251.html">chronological feed</a> and the ability to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/first-big-threads-update-for-ios-helps-you-see-new-followers-195035774.html">sort your following list</a> and view your liked posts.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/threads-now-lets-you-share-posts-directly-to-instagram-dms-201857138.html?src=rss

## Baldur’s Gate 3 credits are missing a bunch of outsourced workers

<p><em>Baldur’s Gate III</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/why-baldurs-gate-iii-is-an-accidental-ps5-console-exclusive-200521291.html"><ins>isn’t even fully released yet</ins></a> and it's already achieved the kind of buzz other developers would sell a kidney for. However, with that buzz comes increased public scrutiny, and it looks like the game failed to credit many of the workers who helped complete the project, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/translators-and-external-developers-reportedly-missing-from-baldurs-gate-3-credits"><ins>as reported by </ins><em><ins>Game Developer.</ins></em></a></p><p>The issue was originally spotted by <a href="https://twitter.com/katrinaltrnsl8r/status/1688948162269261824"><ins>freelance localization producer Katrina Leonoudakis</ins></a>, who noted that the game’s credits failed to mention translators who worked on the Brazilian and Portuguese localizations. A company called Altagram Group handled these translations, and it’s worth noting that company executives and department leads appear in the credits. Additionally, translators who localized to other languages, like Italian, were properly credited, though these translations were handled by companies other than Altagram.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The issue goes beyond translators, as <a href="https://twitter.com/Fl4ky/status/1688212637933518848"><ins>reports also indicate</ins></a> that outsourcing studios failed to list many devs involved with the project. The credits list each studio by name, but not specific employees who worked on the game.</p><p>For its part, Larian is on top of it. The company notes that “this was all Altagram group” and that it has “compelled them to fix this,” in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developer-demands-full-list-of-uncredited-translation-staff-immediately"><ins>statement provided to </ins><em><ins>Eurogamer</ins></em><ins>.</ins></a> The developer goes on to say that a fix is coming soon.</p><p>It’s definitely a good thing that the developer is working to resolve the issue, as people deserve credit for their work. However, this has become an all-too-common practice within the games industry. <em>Game Developer </em>spoke to several localization experts and they described a “laissez-faire” attitude when it comes to properly crediting contractors.

The 2025 Cadillac Escalade IQ is a $130,000-and-up extravagance using <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-04-gm-ultium-ev-batteries.html">GM’s Ultium batteries</a> to offer a 450-mile range. But its price isn’t the only thing that’s formidable about the SUV: It’s even bigger than standard gas-powered Escalades — and nearly as long as the long-wheelbase model, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2021-cadillac-escalade-esv-officially-141800656.html">Escalade ESV</a>. However, Cadillac says it’s still “estimated to be the most aerodynamic full-size SUV ever produced by GM.”</p><p>A 24-module Ultium battery powers the SUV, producing over 200kWh of available energy. It supports 800-volt DC fast charging and can provide up to 100 miles of range in 10 minutes of charging on 350-kW DC charging stations. It supports up to 19.2 kW AC with an estimated 37 miles of range per hour of charging.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Escalade IQ has two electric motors supplying 680 horsepower (505 kW) and 615 lb-ft (834 Nm) of torque in normal mode. However, it can reach 750 hp (560 kW) and 785 lb-ft (1,064 Nm) in a Velocity Max mode. It’s rated to reach 60mph in less than five seconds in Velocity Max.</p><figure><img alt="View from the center console of the 2025 Cadillac Escalade IQ.

The SUV can tow up to 8,000 lbs. It has a dash-spanning 55-inch dual-screen LED display, and its infotainment system runs Android Automotive OS (including Google Assistant, Google Maps and the Play Store). Higher-end tiers offer 360-degree audio through an AKG 40-speaker array.</p><p>Production for the 2025 Escalade IQ will begin next summer at GM’s Factory Zero assembly center in Detroit.

The warrant was first reported <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/09/special-counsel-obtained-search-warrant-for-donald-trumps-twitter-account-00110484">by <em>Politico</em></a> after court documents detailing the warrant surfaced.</p><p>Smith obtained the warrant in January, but had trouble getting the records from Twitter. First, his investigators apparently encountered an “inoperative” website typically used for law enforcement to make legal requests. After they were able to serve the warrant, Twitter was slow to respond, according to <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cadc.39513/gov.uscourts.cadc.39513.1208541751.0.pdf">court records</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The issue, according to newly unsealed court documents, was a nondisclosure agreement that barred Twitter from disclosing the existence of the warrant, including to Trump. The company argued it had a First Amendment right to notify Trump about the warrant, which resulted in months of legal wrangling between Twitter and the special counsel’s office.</p><p>The court sided with the government and Twitter was required to hand over the data. During the litigation, the government amended the nondisclosure order to allow Twitter “to notify the former President of the existence and contents of the warrant” provided they withheld the identity of the case agent.</p><p>But the company missed a court-ordered deadline for turning over all its records, and was fined $350,000 after being held in contempt. “Although Twitter ultimately complied with the warrant, the company did not fully produce the requested information until three days after a court-ordered deadline,” the filing states.</p><p>The legal wrangling underscores the role Trump’s Twitter account played in the events of January 6th. The company suspended the @realdonaldtrump account the evening of the riot after he <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-suspends-donald-trump-001400097.html">tweeted support </a>for the violent mob. Trump’s account was reinstated after Elon Musk acquired the company last year, but the former president has yet to return to the platform.</p><p>The company, now known as X, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/twitter-fined-for-belatedly-complying-with-search-warrant-for-donald-trumps-account-173745495.html?src=rss

## The best smartphones for 2023

<p>Choosing the best smartphone for your needs can be challenging. With so many brands offering similar features at similar prices, it can be hard to understand what device actually has the things you want. If you’ve already determined you only want <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html">an iPhone</a>, your decision-making process is slightly easier. (And even then, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MTMwZTJmMC1hMTRmLTRjNWUtYmRhYi1jZDUyYWM3ZDhlNzkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL2lwaG9uZS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImZjYTY5ODU2LTYwNzEtNDdiZC1hYmFkLTg5MTZmYThiNDMyNyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAX-68mMsUTLsMwRHcmvlHuu4RBCrg99159ozxPJyymuJ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fiphone%2F">Apple’s lineup</a> offers more options than ever.) Those also considering Android will have even more options to choose from, and likely more questions. Do you want a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-11-samsung-galaxy-s20-cameras-ai-tools-space-zooms.html">camera that can zoom into subjects that are extremely far away</a>, or do you want intuitive AI that can screen your incoming calls for you? Here at Engadget, we test smartphones all year round and can help you make sense of what’s available and what to look out for. And, of course, we’ve included our top picks to help you whittle down your shortlist.</p><h2>Android or iOS?</h2><p>When you're searching for the best smartphone, it becomes clear that each OS has its pros and cons. Apple’s tight-knit ecosystem makes it super easy to share data between iPhones, iPads and Macs or seamlessly hand-off phone calls or music from one device to another. At the same time, you’re effectively locked in, as services like Apple Messages aren’t available on other platforms.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As for Android, there’s a much wider range of handsets from companies like Google, Samsung, Sony and more. However, Android phones don’t enjoy that same length of software support and often have lower trade-in values. In short, there’s no wrong answer. However, you will want to consider how your phone will fit in with the rest of your devices. So unless you’re really fed up with one OS and willing to learn another, it probably doesn’t make a lot of sense to switch from an iPhone to an Android phone (or vice versa) – especially if everyone else in your household is using the same platform.</p><h2>Cameras</h2><p>Since your cell phone often pulls double duty as your primary camera, figuring out what kind of photo tools you want is key. Nowadays, practically every mobile phone can take a great picture in bright light. But if you want a long optical zoom, you’ll probably have to upgrade to a more expensive device.</p><figure><img alt="Close up of the Pixel 6 Pro's camera bump." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/91a42bf0-305d-11ec-9f9f-636d29742095" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-engadget-guide-to-the-best-midrange-smartphones-120050366.html">Mid-range phones</a> often only have two rear cameras (a primary wide-angle lens and a secondary ultra-wide camera) and can sometimes struggle in low-light situations. Each phone maker also has various features that might be a better fit for your style, with Apple offering four different color presets on the latest iPhones, while Google’s Pixel 6 comes with neat tools like dedicated long exposure and action pan modes.</p><h2>Will you get 5G or Wi-Fi 6?</h2><p>The good news is that in 2022, most phones have at least 802.11ac Wi-Fi and support for one or more types of 5G connectivity. However, if you want the fastest wireless speeds you can get, it’s going to cost you a bit more. For example, on certain networks, mmWave 5G offers up to gigabit download speeds, less latency and better bandwidth. But mmWave 5G also requires more sophisticated (and pricier) modems, which means support for it is often missing from budget and mid-range handsets like the iPhone SE.</p><p>On the bright side, mmWave 5G isn’t as widely available as other versions of 5G, so depending on where you live and what network you’re on, you may not be missing out on much if you buy a phone that doesn’t support it. It’s a similar situation for Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6e, which are available on a number of high-end devices, but harder to find on less expensive handsets. Wi-Fi 6 also requires you have to have a compatible router, so unless you know you need it or have a specific use case in mind, the lack of support for mmWave 5G or Wi-Fi 6E shouldn’t be a dealbreaker when looking for a new phone.</p><h2>Other features to consider</h2><p>Because not everyone agrees on what makes the best phone, you should think about any other specs that might be extra important for you. Mobile gamers will almost certainly appreciate the 120Hz refresh rates you get on phones like the Samsung Galaxy S23 or the Apple iPhone 14 Pro. Alternatively, if long battery life is important, you’ll probably want to go with a larger iPhone or an Android phone with a battery that’s between 4,000 and 5,000 mAh in size. Meanwhile, if you find yourself juggling a lot of devices, it can be really nice to have a phone that supports reverse wireless charging, which on Samsung phones even lets you recharge the company’s Galaxy Watches.</p><h2>Best iOS smartphone: iPhone 14 Pro</h2><p></p><p>The <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3719d8d4-5edd-4817-998a-91f3229e7323&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Walmart&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNzE5ZDhkNC01ZWRkLTQ4MTctOTk4YS05MWYzMjI5ZTczMjMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FsbWFydC5jb20vaXAvQVQtVC1pUGhvbmUtMTQtUHJvLTEyOEdCLURlZXAtUHVycGxlLzEwODQzMjc4OTU_IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmY2E2OTg1Ni02MDcxLTQ3YmQtYWJhZC04OTE2ZmE4YjQzMjcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVXpOvd4CKVcAAiiaCRswGk8gvLTXfdidK5TBbA-j6Jc&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAT-T-iPhone-14-Pro-128GB-Deep-Purple%2F1084327895%3F">iPhone 14 Pro</a> features the biggest changes to Apple's flagship line in years. With the new Dynamic Island, the company is finally (sort of) ditching the notch and in its place sits a pill-shaped cutout to house the front cameras for Face ID. In addition to being smaller than before, the island also features software tweak that makes notifications, media playback and ongoing activities look more cohesive.</p><p>But it's not just the Dynamic Island that makes the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-14-pro-max-review-dynamic-island-useful-always-on-display-battery-life-camera-test-sample-pictures-130020449.html">iPhone 14 Pro</a> feel like a notable upgrade. The new Always On Display manages to help you stay on top of your notifications without overly draining battery, while the upcoming Emergency SOS via Satellite lets you explore further with some peace of mind. Those who aren't ready to give up physical SIM cards may be reluctant to go for this year's phones, since they don't have onboard slots and are fully eSIM. But thankfully Apple's setup and conversion process makes switching over painless. With excellent performance, capable cameras, an OLED display and respectable battery life, the iPhone 14 Pro is the best Apple handset money can buy.<em> – Cherlynn Low, Deputy Editor</em></p><h2>Best Android smartphone: Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra</h2><p></p><p>The <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f85e63cd-e13c-4f9d-991c-9fbaadede3ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Samsung+Electronics&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmODVlNjNjZC1lMTNjLTRmOWQtOTkxYy05ZmJhYWRlZGUzYWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2Ftc3VuZy5jb20vdXMvc21hcnRwaG9uZXMvZ2FsYXh5LXMyMy11bHRyYS9idXkvZ2FsYXh5LXMyMy11bHRyYS01MTJnYi11bmxvY2tlZC1zbS1zOTE4dXpnZnhhYS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImZjYTY5ODU2LTYwNzEtNDdiZC1hYmFkLTg5MTZmYThiNDMyNyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAZGemkE8rFWMfFLtwCMzUqffJ8m6AKGTEEjf52a9rIaj&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fsmartphones%2Fgalaxy-s23-ultra%2Fbuy%2Fgalaxy-s23-ultra-512gb-unlocked-sm-s918uzgfxaa%2F">Galaxy S23 Ultra</a> has pretty much everything you could want or need on a super premium flagship phone. It features a gorgeous 6.8-inch AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, a speedy Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip, longer battery life and a built-in S Pen for all your drawing and notetaking needs. New for 2023 is a huge 200MP sensor for the phone's main camera, which comes with improved OIS, 8K/30fps video recording and some additional photography tools in the Expert RAW app.</p><p>The main downsides are that starting at $1,200, the S23 Ultra is as expensive as ever, and while its advanced photo and video features have a lot of potential, you need to put in some extra time and effort to get the most out of them. And because the phone's design, display and most of its cameras are so similar to previous models, anyone who bought an S22 last year can safely skip upgrading this time around. But for people who want a true do-everything handset, the S23 Ultra is in a class of its own and is our pick for the best Android phone. <em>– Sam Rutherford, Senior Reporter</em></p><h2>Best midrange Android smartphone: Google Pixel 7a</h2><p></p><p>The $500 <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b3JlLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vP3BsaT0xJmhsPWVuLVVTIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmY2E2OTg1Ni02MDcxLTQ3YmQtYWJhZC04OTE2ZmE4YjQzMjcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAXa17_GAonKLxGFRZWKPj2Q11Gy5lxBn1M8V5wP9Vc8J&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.google.com%2F%3Fpli%3D1%26hl%3Den-US">Pixel 7a</a> delivers everything we look for in a great affordable phone. New features include a faster Tensor G2 chip, a smoother 90Hz display and for the first time on one of Google’s A-series phones: support for wireless charging. And with a refreshed design with IP67 water resistance, it looks and feels like the standard Pixel 7 but for $100 less. You also get great support thanks to five years of security updates and at least three OS upgrades. The phone’s only shortcomings are rather small and include a lack of a dedicated zoom lens and no support for mmWave 5G (unless you purchase a slightly more expensive $550 model from Verizon).  <em>– S.R.</em></p><h2>Best midrange iPhone: iPhone SE (2022)</h2><p></p><p>With an A15 Bionic chip and iOS 15, the latest Apple <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MTMwZTJmMC1hMTRmLTRjNWUtYmRhYi1jZDUyYWM3ZDhlNzkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL2lwaG9uZS1zZS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImZjYTY5ODU2LTYwNzEtNDdiZC1hYmFkLTg5MTZmYThiNDMyNyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAcaqyVrhQuOjjXvhwaJ2rVs78n6Lwg3mPQtkIpOqdriI&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fiphone-se%2F">iPhone SE</a> is possibly the most powerful phone you can find for under $450. Sure, it has a dated design, but some folks might actually appreciate the retro look. The best thing about the iPhone SE is its home button: It’s the only new iPhone to have Touch ID. And though it only has a single rear camera, the SE still takes solid pictures. If you can get over the small, low-res screen, the iPhone SE will serve you well. It’s also really the only sub-$500 option for iOS diehards.</p><p>If you’re open to considering Android and want to spend less than $400, consider something from Samsung’s Galaxy A-series or the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=d8d4d385-7f93-4537-83d1-d5fb47d219ec&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=OnePlus&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJkOGQ0ZDM4NS03ZjkzLTQ1MzctODNkMS1kNWZiNDdkMjE5ZWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub25lcGx1cy5jb20vbjIwLTVnIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmY2E2OTg1Ni02MDcxLTQ3YmQtYWJhZC04OTE2ZmE4YjQzMjcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAbda0HyikEfuVv5t7kB50mvarZ-qW_1CymEtGFKaA2Yu&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Fn20-5g">OnePlus Nord N20</a>.

As long as there’s a chance I might want to take photos, I make sure I’ve brought Google’s latest flagship. The Pixel 7 Pro’s triple rear camera system is versatile enough to capture anything from the largest group shots or wide landscapes to faraway animals (like that time I thought I spotted a whale when staring at a distant blob from Acadia National Park). Google’s Night Sight still outperforms the competition when taking pictures in low lighting conditions, too, and its computational photography delivers clear, vivid photos.</p><p>Of course, Samsung and Apple’s flagships are closing the gap, and these days there is little difference between the photos they deliver. Some people might even prefer the warmer tint on Galaxy devices. But special features like Google’s Magic Eraser and Motion effects make the Pixel 7 Pro the most fun to shoot with. Plus, I love the additional tools you get on Pixel phones, like Call Screening, Material You theming and Live Captions, among others. <em>– C.L.</em></p><h2>Best foldable for multitasking: Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5</h2><p></p><p></p><p>While Samsung didn’t make a ton of changes to the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TQU1TVU5HLVN0b3JhZ2UtVW5sb2NrZWQtU21hcnRwaG9uZS1TdHJlYW1pbmcvZHAvQjBDNjNRR0dCSz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby03ei0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZmNhNjk4NTYtNjA3MS00N2JkLWFiYWQtODkxNmZhOGI0MzI3In0&amp;signature=AQAAAbzYoVnFePiHB4dfF4KCwBF8byx10y5ZyhLV0fkmfKJc&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSAMSUNG-Storage-Unlocked-Smartphone-Streaming%2Fdp%2FB0C63QGGBK">Z Fold 5</a>, it’s still the best big flexible phone on the market.

New for 2023 is a faster Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip, improved brightness, expanded multitasking capabilities and most importantly, a completely redesigned hinge. Not only does Samsung’s new Flex hinge eliminate the gap between the two sides of the phone when it's closed (to help keep dust out), it also makes the phone thinner (down to 13.4mm from 15.8mm), which is a nice change for what was already a somewhat bulky device.

The clear winner of that race in the flip-phone category, though, continues to be Samsung. While Motorola’s Razr+ gave the Galaxy Z Flip series some serious competition, it still wasn’t good enough. With this year’s <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMEM2M0tEN0pQP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTd6LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmY2E2OTg1Ni02MDcxLTQ3YmQtYWJhZC04OTE2ZmE4YjQzMjcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAesWiqk8fFXDWzE9tXWjaz1aTvnIpcqC6qGIVhMSsqe-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0C63KD7JP">Z Flip 5</a>, Samsung brought a larger external display that’s more functional than previous generations. You’ll have to jump through a few hoops to enable full-sized apps and maximize the experience on that screen, but once you do, the Flip 5 realizes its potential.</p><p>This year, Samsung also updated the hinges on its Z series, using a new dual-rail structure that’s supposed to better diffuse impact than before. It also creates a water drop-shaped crease that the company says results in less stress on the screen, which should improve overall durability. Even if your Flip does break, Samsung is better positioned to handle repairs than any other foldable maker in the US, since it’s the most established player here.</p><p>The Flip 5 also has superior cameras compared to the Moto Razr+, delivering richer, more saturated colors in daylight. Of course, don’t expect flagship-level pictures from any flip-style foldable. The Flip 5 pales in comparison to the likes of the latest iPhone or Pixel in low light, but for the most part, its pictures will be good enough for Instagram. Plus, you’ll have a lot more fun snapping selfies or group photos with a foldable, since it can act as its own tripod when flexed and you can see yourself in the external display. And don’t forget Samsung’s handy open-palm gesture that triggers a camera timer, which will make capturing stills or videos much easier from a distance.</p><p>When it’s time to kick back on your couch, the Flip 5 also delivers. It has the fastest processor on a foldable and a vibrant internal screen that refreshes at up to 120Hz for smooth scrolling and animations. It doesn’t have the longest battery life, especially when compared to non-folding flagships like the Galaxy S23. But if you don’t mind charging your phone whenever you’re near an outlet, and a flipping foldable is on your shopping list, the Galaxy Z Flip 5 is the best foldable with this form factor. <em>— C.L.</em></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review-still-the-best-flip-foldable-163030055.html"><strong>Read our full review of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5</strong></a></p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>How do I know which smartphone is the best for me?</h3><p>While choosing the best smartphone can be challenging, it mostly comes down to how you plan on using the device. All of the best smartphones available now get the basics right — you’ll be able to make calls, text and access the internet without many hiccups. If your smartphone is your most used gadget, you may want to consider paying for a device on the higher end of the price spectrum. That will get you better overall performance, higher-quality cameras and a phone that will last for many years. If you don’t use your phone for everything, you may be able to compromise on performance and extra perks and spend less on a still-capable handset.</p><h3>How much is a smartphone?</h3><p>Smartphones range in price from $300 to over $1,500. The best budget phones available now will usually compromise on overall performance, design, camera prowess and extra features to keep costs down. On the flip side, the most expensive phones will have powerful processors, triple-camera arrays and even flip or fold designs. Most people will find a smartphone that fits their needs somewhere in the middle of that wide price range — we’ve found that most of the best smartphones available right now cost between $500 and $1,000.</p><h3>What can you do on a smartphone?</h3><p>Smartphones are essentially small, portable computers that let you do things like check email, browse social media, follow map directions, make contactless payments and more. This is all on top of the basics like making phone calls and texting, which we’ve come to expect in all modern cell phones. Smartphones have also mostly replaced compact cameras thanks to their high-quality, built-in shooters, and the fact that most smartphones today as just as portable, if not more so, as compact cameras.</p><h3>How long do smartphones last?</h3><p>Smartphones can last years and people are <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252524995/Smartphone-trade-value-rises-as-average-age-of-devices-breaks-35-year-threshold">holding on to their phones</a> longer now than ever before. Software updates and battery life are two of the biggest factors that can affect smartphone longevity. Apple promises five years worth of software updates for its latest iPhones, and Google promises the same for its Pixel phones. Samsung phones will get four years worth of Android updates from the time they launch. As for charging speeds and battery life, your phone can deteriorate over time as you use and recharge your phone on a regular basis.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-smartphones-140004900.html?src=rss

## Lyft plans to ditch surge pricing, which riders hate 'with a fiery passion'

<p>Our local and state level government systems <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ransomware-hackers-leak-second-batch-of-city-data-from-oakland-attack-163350688.html">are hacked and held ransom</a> with disheartening regularity. At the Black Hat USA Conference in Las Vegas on Wednesday, the Biden Administration revealed its plans to better defend the nation’s critical digital infrastructure: It's launching a DARPA-led challenge competition to build AI systems capable of proactively identifying and fixing software vulnerabilities. That’s right, we’re having a hackathon!</p><p>The “AI Cyber Challenge” (AIxCC) is a two-year development program open to competitors throughout the US. It’s being hosted by DARPA in collaboration with Anthropic, Google, Microsoft and OpenAI. Those companies are providing both their expertise in the field and access to their AI technologies.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“The challenge is critical in bringing together the cutting-edge in automatic software, security and AI, which will empower our cyber defenses by being able to quickly exploit and fix software vulnerabilities,” Anne Neuberger, Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology, said during a press call Tuesday.</p><p>“This is one of the ways that public and private sectors work together to do big things to change how the future unfolds,” Arati Prabhakar, Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, added. “That's why the White House asked DARPA to take on the critical topic of AI for cybersecurity.”</p><p>White House officials concede that properly securing the nation’s sprawling federal software systems against intrusion is a daunting task. “They don't have the tools capable of security at this scale,” Perri Adams, Program Manager, Information Innovation Office, DARPA, said during the call. “We've seen in recent years, hackers exploiting the state of affairs, posing a serious national security risk.”</p><p>Despite those vulnerabilities, “I think we have to keep one step ahead and AI offers a very promising approach for that,” Adams said. There’s nearly $20 million in prize money up for grabs. And to ensure that the competition isn’t dominated by the teams with the deepest pockets, DARPA is making $7 million available to small businesses who want to compete as well.</p><p>The research agency will hold an open qualifying event next spring where the top scoring teams (up to 20 can potentially qualify) will get invited to the semifinals at DEF CON 24. That cohort will be whittled down to the top five teams, who will win monetary prizes at the competition and be invited back to DEF CON 25 for the finals. The top three scoring teams from DC25 will win even more money. You land first place, you get $4 million — but to do so, your AI had better be able to, “rapidly defend critical infrastructure codes from attack,” per White House officials. Ideally, the resulting system would scour networks seeking out and autonomously repairing any software security bugs it finds.&nbsp;</p><p>The winning team will also be strongly encouraged to open-source their resulting program. The competition is bringing on The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF), a Linux Foundation project, as an advisor to the challenge. Their job is to help ensure that the code is put to use immediately, “by everyone from volunteer, open-source developers to commercial industry,” Adams said. “If we're successful, I hope to see AIxCC not only produce the next generation of cybersecurity tools in this space, but show how AI can be used to better society by defending its critical underpinnings.”</p><p>“The president has been completely clear that we have got to get AI right for the American people,” Prabhakar said. Last fall the Biden White House unveiled its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/white-house-unveils-its-blueprint-for-an-ai-bill-of-rights-175912494.html">Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights</a>, which defined the Administration’s core values and goals on the subject. Follow-up efforts included pushing for an <a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework">AI risk management framework</a> and investing $140 million in establishing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-administration-will-invest-140-million-to-launch-seven-new-national-ai-research-institutes-090026144.html">seven new national research institutes to AI and machine learning</a>.

<p>Federal regulatory agencies have fined 11 financial institutions a combined $549 million for using “off-channel” messaging apps (WhatsApp, iMessage, Signal and text messages) for conversations about trades and other business. Securities laws require investment firms and banks to preserve communications records and ensure employees only carry out business through authorized channels. “The firms did not maintain or preserve the substantial majority of these off-channel communications, in violation of the federal securities laws,” the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) wrote in <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-149">a statement</a> today.</p><p>The Wall Street firms were fined over half a billion dollars in penalties for using messaging apps instead of email, approved messaging platforms or other easily archived channels. Firms penalized by the SEC include Wells Fargo ($125 million), BNP Paribas ($35 million), SG Americas Securities ($35 million), BMO Capital Markets ($25 million), Mizuho Securities ($25 million), Houlihan Lokey Capital ($15 million), Moelis &amp; Company ($10 million), Wedbush Securities ($10 million) and SMBC Nikko Securities America ($9 million). Meanwhile, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8762-23">fined</a> Wells Fargo ($75 million), BNP Paribas ($75 million), Société Générale ($75 million) and Bank of Montreal ($35 million).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“Recordkeeping failures such as those here undermine our ability to exercise effective regulatory oversight, often at the expense of investors,” said Sanjay Wadhwa, the SEC’s Deputy Director of Enforcement. “The Commission’s message could not be more clear — recordkeeping and supervision requirements are fundamental, and registrants that fail to comply with these core regulatory obligations do so at their own peril,” said CFTC Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley.</p><p>Federal regulators said all firms admitted to the facts about unapproved communications in agreeing to the penalties. “As described in the SEC’s orders, the firms admitted that from at least 2019, their employees often communicated through various messaging platforms on their personal devices, including iMessage, WhatsApp, and Signal, about the business of their employers,” the SEC wrote in a statement. “The firms did not maintain or preserve the substantial majority of these off-channel communications, in violation of the federal securities laws. By failing to maintain and preserve required records, certain of the firms likely deprived the Commission of these off-channel communications in various SEC investigations.”</p><p>Both government agencies stressed that the problem was pervasive and not limited to entry-level employees and junior staff. “The failures involved employees at multiple levels of authority, including supervisors and senior executives,” the SEC said.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wall-street-banks-fined-549-million-for-not-backing-up-messaging-app-histories-164552963.html?src=rss

## Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 review: Still the best flip-foldable

<p>Three point five inches. That’s about the size of the original iPhone’s display. That’s downright tiny compared to today’s smartphones, and it’s hard to imagine typing or using most modern apps on such a cramped screen. But as a secondary panel on a phone that folds in half, even 3.4 inches feels positively roomy. At least, it’s much more useful than the 1.9-inch sliver that we got on last year’s Galaxy Z Flip 4.</p><p>With its latest flip-style foldable, Samsung brings a 3.4-inch external display that it’s confusingly renamed the Flex Window (it doesn’t flex, so yes, I’m mad at the name). And that’s about it. The Galaxy Z Flip 5 also has a new hinge that allows for gapless closure when folded, as well as some software tweaks. Aside from those updates, this phone is very similar to its predecessor, with basically the same cameras, water-resistance rating and battery size. It also costs the same as last year’s model and comes with twice the base storage, which is a nice touch. But with greater competition in the US this year, Samsung can no longer coast on being the only player in the space.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p></p><h2>Design</h2><p>One of a few signs that Samsung is coasting? The Flip 5’s design. Setting aside its larger external display, this thing looks pretty much identical to its predecessor, which itself was basically a clone of the version before it. The Flip 5’s frame is the same 6.5 x 2.8-inch rectangle as last year’s model, and it cuts the same 0.27-inch profile, too. It also maintains the same weight, measuring 6.6 ounces (or 187 grams).</p><div id="fb68bb3e4dac4356b7c54f299cc3116c"></div><p>Some things <em>have</em> changed this year, though. The external cameras are no longer stacked vertically on top of each other; they’re laid out side by side, presumably to accommodate the new larger screen. The available colors are also different, which I appreciate, since the purple hue on last year’s model was getting a bit stale. This time, you can choose from pink and a minty green, in addition to the standard cream and black. Sadly, our review unit is the basic black version, but the green variant I saw at Samsung’s launch event is worth lusting after.</p><p>A notable upgrade on the Z Flip 5 is what Samsung calls its Flex Hinge, which allows the device to fold completely flat and leave no gap between the two halves of its internal screen. This should not only appeal to people who were put off by the asymmetry of the previous design, but it leaves less of a chance that a key in your purse might get lodged in that little opening and scratch the fragile panel.</p><p>That’s not to say that the Flip 5 is dust resistant. Its IPX8 rating means it can withstand brief submersion in water, but it wasn’t tested for protection from foreign solid particles. That’s a lot of jargon to say the Flip 5 will be fine if you drop it in the tub, but it’s more susceptible to, say, sand, than most modern smartphones. However, the phone’s exterior is likely tougher than its inside, thanks to the Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 glass covering its rear and Flex Window.</p><h2>External display</h2><p>Regardless of my feelings toward Samsung’s absurd name, the Flex Window is a major improvement over last year’s Cover display. It’s a 3.4-inch Super AMOLED panel with a 60Hz refresh rate and 720 x 748 resolution, and the photos I chose as my wallpapers looked crisp and vibrant. But the biggest upgrade is its size.</p><p>The benefits are obvious: A larger canvas means you can see more at once and buttons can be bigger and easier to hit. With the extra space, the Weather widget can display the forecast for multiple days, while the Calendar offers a monthly view.</p><figure><img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 completely folded shut. It's sitting on its top edge with its external display facing the camera, showing the time and date." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/c65b4cf0-36ca-11ee-9e6f-a34414eeb67e" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Unlike Motorola’s Razr+, though, the Flip 5 doesn’t behave like full Android on its cover screen. It runs One UI in a way that’s more like the company’s Tizen OS for its older smartwatches.  You’ll swipe left through widgets like Timer, Stopwatch, Samsung Health, Dialer and more, drag down from the home page for quick settings and swipe right to see your notifications. But because the Flip 5 supports up to 13 widgets, rotating through the carousel to find what you need can quickly get tedious. Thankfully, Samsung added a new pinch gesture that lets you zoom out to see all your widgets at once and jump to what you want.</p><p>Though you can’t natively run every app in the world on the Flex Window, the company did optimize a handful to work on the smaller panel. You have to go into Settings to enable them, but once you do you can launch Google Maps, YouTube, Netflix, Messages and WhatsApp on the external display. I guess these are the ones Samsung thinks people most want to use when the Flip is closed.</p><p>If you’re feeling adventurous, you can install Good Lock from the Galaxy App Store, which lets you run pretty much any app on the outside. It took me a while to figure out that to get this to work, you’ll have to go into Good Lock and download the MultiStar launcher, then add the launcher as a widget on the Flex Window. Once I did, though, I quickly selected apps like Instagram, Chrome, Reddit and Gallery to run on the outside. Each of them ran as expected — that is, as a mini version of itself on an awkwardly shaped screen.</p><p>This is a good time to point out that the Flip 5’s Flex Window isn’t a typical rectangle. It’s shaped more like a document folder, mostly square with a small tab on the bottom left. Functionally, that extra space doesn’t get in the way of apps or widgets. Swiping up on it brings you back to the home page, and if you have a timer or song running, a little countdown shows up there.</p><figure><img alt="Side view of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 folded shut. There is no gap between the two halves of the internal screen." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/7f083790-36cb-11ee-b7eb-4ad41a6f3734" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>You don’t have to install Good Lock to find the new Flex Window useful, but it does make for a better experience. For example, when replying to a notification from an app like Telegram, you won’t actually be able to see the message your friend sent. This might be because Telegram notifications are typically hidden anyway, to prevent onlookers from seeing your chats. So if you want to respond to Telegram contacts, you’ll likely still have to open the Flip to see what they said.</p><p>That is, unless you use Good Lock to let the app run outside, in which case tapping the notification on the Flex Window will just take you to the conversation in the app. It’s surprisingly smooth and weirdly satisfying to see a non-native experience work so well.</p><p>Replying to messages is another improvement over the Flip 4, by the way. Samsung now has room to offer a QWERTY keyboard, and typing on it is an absolute delight. I have relatively small hands, and reaching across this panel to hit letters like Q and A was no trouble, especially with swipe typing. The Flip 5’s software is more refined than the Moto’s, too, since the latter’s keyboard takes over the entire screen and requires an extra tap to actually send your reply. Samsung’s interface also lets you see some of your conversation above the input field, whereas you won’t see any of it on the Razr+.</p><figure><img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 folded shut, held in mid-air. Its external screen shots a person taking a photo of the camera viewfinder feature." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/2d800650-36cb-11ee-9f77-7b012443f131" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>The larger Flex Window also makes for a far superior viewfinder for the external cameras. With the increased space, I can now see the entire frame when lining up a selfie or setting up a video. Swiping sideways on this viewfinder screen switches between Portrait, Photo or Video modes, while pinching changes the level of zoom and the ultrawide camera kicks in at 0.5x.</p><h2>Cameras</h2><p>While the experience of using the external 12-megapixel cameras has drastically improved thanks to the Flex Window, image quality itself has not. Samsung uses basically the same sensors on the Flip 5 as those on the Flip 4, and though there’s no generational upgrade, they still take pretty good pictures.</p><p>In fact, out of all two flip-style foldables available in the US, the Flip 5 easily gains the upper hand. Its only competition is the Moto Razr+, which has similar sensors on paper but delivers washed out photos in comparison.</p><p>My photos of the Metropolitan Museum of Art showed vibrant blue skies and red banners when I used the Z Flip 4 and Flip 5, but the scene seemed pale when I shot it with the Razr+. Though I prefer the rosier hues in selfies I snapped with the Razr+, the ones that Samsung produced had more accurate colors.</p><figure><img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 flexed at a 90-degree angle, with its internal display showing the camera app." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/5344e8b0-36cb-11ee-bbdd-d555d9f2c460" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>At night, cityscapes were pretty grainy across all three phones I tested, but the Flip 4 and Flip 5 were slightly better at exposing buildings amidst all the lights in New York. Though both Samsung phones were neck-and-neck in terms of low-light photo quality, I was pleasantly surprised that the Flip 5 took about half the time of its predecessor when capturing a shot in Night mode. As a result, I didn’t have to hold still for as long, and my selfies from the newer handset were clearer.</p><p>I also enjoyed using the Flip 5 and Razr+ as TikTok machines, setting them up with their cover screens facing out to shoot some (hopefully) humorous clips. Video quality was, again, very close across the three devices. In short, don’t write off the Flip 5’s cameras, but you won’t be writing home about the photos you took, either.</p><h2>As a “regular” phone</h2><p>You won’t be spending all your time with the Flip 5 using only its external screen. For the most part, you’ll most likely interact with the flexible 6.7-inch Full HD AMOLED panel inside, which is what I did. I’ll admit, I mostly used this phone to scroll Reddit or Instagram and play mind-numbing puzzle games like <em>Goods Sort</em> and <em>Solitaire</em>.</p><p>Everything felt as it did on last year’s Flip — even the crease looks the same. My friends’ vacation photos and game graphics were colorful and crisp. At certain angles, content looked slightly discolored under the wrinkle, but it didn’t bother me. I also enjoyed stroking the crease as much as I did before. There’s something deliciously satisfying about repeatedly running my thumb over it.</p><figure><img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 open completely flat, tilted at an angle. A crease is visible in its middle, and words on the Reddit app are slightly distorted over the hinge." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/f02abb10-36ca-11ee-bbfd-be70a41313d6" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>I also tried a few times to carefully push my thumb into the screen as I started to bend the phone to close it, and I never felt like the panel was going to break. But of course, I’ve only had the Flip 5 for slightly over a week, so long-term use may reveal durability issues. It’s worth noting, though, that compared to Motorola, Samsung has a more established repair and parts replacement system in place. Should you actually damage your foldable, or if you know you’re accident prone, the better company to choose is Samsung.</p><p>There are some software updates to Flex Mode that I didn’t spend a lot of time with, mostly because I don’t find them all that useful in daily use. As a refresher, Flex Mode is an interface that kicks in when you bend the phone slightly and have it open at between 20 and 160 degrees (approximately). Compatible apps will split their layout in half, typically showing content up top and controls below. Like on older Flips, apps that work well with this are YouTube, which continues to display the video on the higher half while letting you scroll through comments at the bottom.</p><p>This year, though, you can choose to (after first toggling through several hidden settings) display a button at the bottom left of every app. It’ll bring up the Flex dashboard, which offers shortcuts for taking a screenshot, pulling down the notifications shade and more. Some of these, like the two I named, are helpful. But some, like the touchpad that you can enable, are just silly. With the touchpad, you can drag your finger around the bottom half of the screen to maneuver a cursor up top. In some situations, like for people with mobility issues, I can see this being useful. For most other scenarios, however, it’s usually easier to just reach a little and tap the top half of the screen.</p><figure><img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 folded at a 90-degree angle and sitting on a stack of books with the camera app showing." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/beaf8920-36cb-11ee-9efe-2d055158dc51" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><h2>Performance and battery life</h2><p>We’re reaching a point where smaller foldable phones are pretty much as fast as their non-flexible counterparts, which brings them ever so slightly closer to being feasible as mainstream devices. Thanks to its Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy processor, the Flip 5 is on par with flagships like the Galaxy S23+. It also packs the same 8GB of RAM, and this year’s Flip even offers twice the base storage of its predecessor, starting with 256GB.</p><p>No matter what I threw at it, the Flip 5 never hiccuped. Granted, I never played a game more demanding than <em>Criminal Minds</em> or <em>CSI: Hidden Crimes</em> on it, but I was also pleased when I realized the phone never really ran alarmingly warm.</p><p>The Flip 5’s Geekbench 6 scores of 2,015 (single-core) and 4,972 (multi-core) were about the same as the Z Fold 5, and significantly better than the Pixel Fold, which uses Google’s own Tensor G2 chip.</p><p>This is clearly flagship-level performance, so you’re not sacrificing much if you pick a Flip over a traditional handset. But one area where foldables tend to fall short is battery life. The Flip 5 delivered very similar runtime to its predecessor, which isn’t a shocker considering its battery is the same 3,700mAh. Sure, it has a larger external screen to power, but precisely due to the Flex Window being more useful, I didn’t have to open up the Flip 5 as much as the older model. So it makes sense that both Flips had about the same endurance.</p><figure><img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 with its external display facing the camera, showing the viewfinder." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/e0c74200-36cb-11ee-bbf7-998bde7cbf2e" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>Here we are, staring at the fifth generation of Samsung’s Galaxy Z series of foldables and still asking the same question: Are phones with flexible displays ready for the mainstream? With its larger and more useful external screen, the Flip 5 is the best candidate in the category’s history to appeal outside the tech-savvy crowd. It offers excellent performance, capable cameras and — lest we forget — it folds in half! Plus, it combines relatively advanced bendable-screen tech with an exterior panel in a size that’s sure to win nostalgia points, meaning it’ll appeal to experimentalists and sentimentalists alike.</p><p>If your existing Flip is falling apart, the Flip 5 is worth the upgrade for the Flex Window alone. But if you’re contemplating adopting a foldable for the first time, just know that you’ll probably sacrifice some camera quality, have to take extra care when manhandling the device and resign yourself to always be charging. In exchange, you’ll get a very capable phone, some cool points and an easy conversation starter.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review-still-the-best-flip-foldable-163030055.html?src=rss

<p>Following the release of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-air-5th-generation-review-130019050.html">2022 Apple iPad Air</a> and Samsung’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-s-8-review-in-a-class-of-its-own-132946024.html">Galaxy Tab S8 line</a> last year, there hasn’t been a ton of movement in the tablet world. Lenovo announced refreshed versions of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-ideapad-5-i-chromebook-announced-specs-availability-pricing-040045300.html">Tab P11 and P11 Pro</a> featuring updated internals and even an 11.2-inch OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate on the Pro. Apple's latest tablet is the revamped 10.9-inch iPad, but at $449, it's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-ipads-how-to-pick-the-best-apple-tablet-for-you-150054066.html">more of an upgrade from</a>, rather than alternative for, the less expensive 10.2-inch iPad. While there haven't been a ton of groundbreaking releases as of late, you still have a bunch of great tablets to choose from if you're in the market for a new one or are looking for a laptop replacement. Let's break down what you should consider before deciding on a new device, and our current top picks for the best tablets.&nbsp;</p><h2>Which OS is right for me?</h2><p>Before you even start looking at specific devices, consider how your new tablet will fit in with the gadgets you already own, and how you plan to use it. For example, if everyone in your house uses Macs and iPhones, it probably doesn’t make a lot of sense to buy an Android tablet, even if you’ve been tempted by the massive 14.6-inch screen on the new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra-hands-on-price-specs-features-150056575.html">Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra.</a> This goes double for anyone with an extensive library of purchased videos and music that might be harder to access after switching platforms.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Another consideration is the kind of work you’ll be doing. That’s because while most modern tablets are adept at browsing websites or playing games, some operating systems like iPadOS and Windows 11 are better designed to support multitasking and productivity than Android or even Chrome OS. It’s a similar situation for software, because while most popular apps and games are available on both Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store, more specialized software may only have proper support on desktop platforms like Windows or macOS.</p><h2>What size screen should I get?</h2><p>Figuring out the best screen size for you will also be related to the kind of work (or play) you intend to do. Larger displays make it much easier to view two apps side by side, and big screens also deliver a more immersive movie viewing experience. But at the same time, the larger the tablet, the less likely you’re going to want to move it around. That means you’re not only going to want to take stock of your workspace (i.e., if you have a desk or instead plan to work from a couch or even your bed), you’re also going to want to think about how the device will fit into your everyday routine or commute (if you have one).</p><h2>Potential accessories</h2><p>Finally, you’ll want to consider any add-ons or accessories you’re planning to use, which can range from detachable keyboards to things like external mics or a stylus. The good news is that many of the best tablets nowadays offer some kind of keyboard accessory, which allows the device to function more like a 2-in-1 instead of simply being a content consumption device. Some tablets also feature things like microSD card slots that support expandable storage, or optional 4G or 5G connectivity, which can be a real boon to frequent travelers. And if you’re planning to use the tablet mainly for work, you might want to grab a USB hub for connecting all your favorite peripherals.</p><h2>How we test</h2><p>When evaluating different tablets, there are a few important things we look for above all else: solid performance, a good screen and long battery life. For performance, we run a handful of synthetic tests like Geekbench 6, while also performing a number of real-world use cases such as editing photos and playing games. And with tablets often serving as hybrid devices, we also consider how easy it is to multitask and switch quickly between various apps. The more responsive a device feels, the better.</p><p>Because a tablet’s display is such a critical component, we also view a wide range of content to gauge things like brightness, color gamut and dynamic range. It’s important to take into account the difference between various panel types like OLED, which typically produce richer colors and excellent contrast but may not be as bright as a mini LED display. Recently, refresh rate has become an increasingly important spec as 90Hz and 120Hz screens can make scrolling smoother and graphics appear sharper in games.</p><p>We also consider a tablet’s design (including things like size, weight and water resistance), its connectivity (WiFi, Bluetooth, NFC, 5G, et cetera) and special features like stylus support or the ability to serve as a secondary display. That’s because, while tablets were often viewed as content consumption devices in the past, higher-end devices like the Surface Pro and iPad Pro are more than capable of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-best-2-in-1-laptops-for-2023-155052641.html">replacing a laptop</a> for a lot of people.</p><p>Finally, we test battery life by running our standard local video rundown test, which involves playing a single video on a loop from 100 percent until it runs out of juice. Ideally, a tablet should be able to last an entire working day, but longer runtimes are always welcome.</p><h2>Best tablet overall: Apple iPad Pro</h2><p></p><p>Powered by the same Apple M2 chips you get in MacBooks, the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9zdG9yZXMvcGFnZS80NUUxNDM0QS1GRDU4LTQwQTctQkMxNC1BNjk4Q0QzNkRGN0M_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&amp;signature=AQAAAZtPDfg5pd1RjnTecI9phynDaRaaLjiKYx-zC0Bi7XBO&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fstores%2Fpage%2F45E1434A-FD58-40A7-BC14-A698CD36DF7C%3F_encoding%3DUTF8%26store_ref%3DSB_A08778292RIRQ4ZUH855M%26pd_rd_plhdr%3Dt%26aaxitk%3D094f12dbd533746035ea73fa272aab9f%26hsa_cr_id%3D4219929570501%26lp_asins%3DB09323PCV7%2CB09QHXTHYZ%26lp_query%3Dipad%2Bpro%26lp_slot%3Dauto-sparkle-hsa-tetris%26pd_rd_w%3D3YSC5%26pf_rd_p%3D488a18be-6d86-4de0-8607-bd4ea4b560f3%26pd_rd_wg%3DwZIHz%26pf_rd_r%3DJC6ZAVKVCP3XWFPMPVQA%26pd_rd_r%3D831f2cf4-13f7-48da-869d-440099b8f100%26">iPad Pro</a> is the best iPad and one of the most well-built tablets you can buy today.

And thanks to their 120Hz ProMotion mini-LED displays, the iPad Pro’s screen boasts strong brightness and fluid visuals, regardless of whether you’re watching a movie or creating a slideshow presentation. Recent versions of iPadOS have also made Apple’s most premium tablet a much more capable work device, with the addition of new sidebars for quickly switching between apps, a more powerful desktop-like UI for Safari, and various new toolbars throughout.</p><p>The main downside is that starting at <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BcHBsZS0xMS1pbmNoLWlQYWQtUHJvLVdpLUZpLTEyOEdCL2RwL0IwQkpMQktNVjg_dGg9MSZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1mdC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjcxOTRhN2QtODQzNS00ODAyLThlYzAtM2JmZGI3ZDk5Y2JhIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAXQgYt8j7AxYhJYRafgADHYeD-wqY-cVcykEBAhoz4e0&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-11-inch-iPad-Pro-Wi-Fi-128GB%2Fdp%2FB0BJLBKMV8%3Fth%3D1">$800</a> for a base 11-inch model with 128GB of storage, Apple’s iPad Pros aren’t cheap, and that’s before you tack on any extras like cellular connectivity or a keyboard. But considering there’s a good chance the latest iPad Pro is more powerful than your current laptop, there isn’t really anything you can throw at Apple’s top-of-the-line tablet it can’t handle.</p><p>One final note is that if you like the iPad Pro but want something a bit more affordable, there’s also the<a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDlWM0pIM1hTP3RoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZnQtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjI3MTk0YTdkLTg0MzUtNDgwMi04ZWMwLTNiZmRiN2Q5OWNiYSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAS2WWBMEcHsYY6z8Lo7EEAi9R4bDYi8pAxtclAQdog9v&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09V3JH3XS%3Fth%3D1"> fifth-gen iPad Air.</a> This one is powered by the M1 chipset, but it has Apple Pencil support and optional 5G connectivity. And with a 10.9-inch screen, it’s basically the same size as the smaller iPad Pro too. The main difference is that the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-air-5th-generation-review-130019050.html">iPad Air’s</a> display isn’t quite as bright and doesn’t support a 120Hz refresh rate.

While it’s not compelling enough as a tablet to knock the Galaxy Tab S8 out of our top spot, it could be an intriguing option for those that want a device that can be used as both a tablet and a smart display. Admittedly, it shines as the latter, which makes it a good thing that Google includes the base in the $500 price. There’s also an $80 case you can get for the Pixel Tablet, which adds a very useful kickstand that you can use whenever you don’t want to dock the device but still want to prop it up.</p><p>We'll also note that the latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-hands-on-a-premium-tablet-with-water-protection-110020872.html">Galaxy Tab S9 tablets</a> have been announced and will be widely available soon. There are a lot of similarities between the S8 series and the S9 slabs, but Samsung added improved dust and water resistance to this year's models, along with upgraded processors.

Another nice bonus is that unlike a lot of tablets, the Surface Pro 9’s SSD is user accessible, allowing you to upgrade its storage yourself whenever you want. And thanks to improvements in Windows 11, the Surface Pro 9 is better suited to life as a tablet without ever needing to attach a smart keyboard thanks to larger app icons and more touch-friendly controls.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Display: </strong>13-inch or 15-inch PixelSense touchscreen</p></li><li><p><strong>Processor: </strong>Microsoft SQ3 or Intel Evo i5/i7</p></li><li><p><strong>Storage: </strong>128GB to 1TB</p></li><li><p><strong>Battery life: </strong>Up to 15.5 hours</p></li><li><p><strong>Camera: </strong>1080p Windows Hello front camera, 10MP rear camera</p></li></ul><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/surface-pro-9-5g-review-sq3-arm-173012304.html"><strong>Read our full review of the Microsoft Surface Pro 9</strong></a></p><h2>Best budget tablet: Apple 10.2-inch iPad</h2><p></p><p>If you just want a simple tablet for a reasonable price, it’s hard to go wrong with the standard Apple iPad.

We recommend taking stock of the gadgets you already have — do you live in the Apple ecosystem already? An iPad might be best for you then. Do you have a Samsung phone? If so, a Galaxy Tab will likely be the most convenient choice. There is no one &quot;best brand&quot; for tablets; you’ll find good options made by companies including Apple, Google, Samsung, Microsoft and Amazon.</p><h3>Can a tablet replace a laptop?</h3><p>It’s possible for a tablet to replace a laptop, but you’ll need a few accessories to truly make the experience as close as possible to that of a traditional notebook. A keyboard is a must, be it a keyboard case or a Bluetooth accessory that you keep with you. Some keyboard cases, like apple’s Magic Keyboard for the iPad, have a built-in trackpad, which will be more ergonomic than tapping on your tablet’s screen for input. Additionally, you could go one step further and use a wireless mouse that connects via Bluetooth to your tablet. If you’re primarily looking for a tablet to replace your laptop, consider buying a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-best-2-in-1-laptops-for-2023-155052641.html">2-in-1 laptop</a> since those systems typically consist of high-powered tablets that are designed to work well with (and without) keyboards.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-tablets-150026056.html?src=rss

If you pre-order one, you can get double the storage (jumping from 256GB up to 512GB) and a $200 Amazon gift card at no extra cost. That should take some of the sting out of the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMENDQzMyN1BNLz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby0xc3ItMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjY1ZWViYjFjLTgyYWYtNDllOS1iYjRiLTMwMjc2N2U0M2Y2NiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAdsKCzp4fDz4TlbU0YPFqCFMSweE-fXP6M4PFKK08wwr&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CCC327PM%2F"><ins>$1,800 price</ins></a>.</p><p></p><p>In our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/galaxy-z-fold-5-review-five-years-in-samsung-is-treading-water-140002461.html"><ins>review of the Galaxy Z Fold 5</ins></a>, we gave the device a score of 86. We feel that Samsung is still making the best foldable out there. However, the company could be doing more with the format (such as trying to bring down the price) as its momentum in the space seems to be slowing.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The big change this year is the new Flex Hinge. It's smaller than the hinge in previous Fold devices and it helps make the handset slightly thinner. That's because it allows the phone to close properly and get rid of the gap between the two halves.</p><p>Samsung has upgraded many other components. There's a brighter main display and a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 that helps to improve the performance. Two new gestures could make it easier to get the phone to do what you want. Battery life is solid as well — the Galaxy Z Fold 5 lasted for nearly 20 hours on a single charge in our video rundown test.</p><p>Although Samsung has stuck with the same camera setup as last year's model, you can still take good quality photos with the Galaxy Z Fold 5. It's also disappointing that there's no option to store an S Pen inside the device and that it's still fairly bulky. Still, if you're looking for a foldable phone, we reckon this is the best one out there.</p><div id="f841eeabb03046bf9b6911be66636553"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>In case the Galaxy Z Flip 5 is more compelling to you, there's a pre-order offer for that device too.

## Galaxy Z Fold 5 review: Five years in, Samsung is treading water

<p>In 2019, Samsung released the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-22-samsung-galaxy-fold-review-expensive-experiment.html">original Galaxy Fold</a>, the first phone with a flexible display (not counting pretenders like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-07-royole-flexpai-hands-on.html">Royole Flexpai</a>). And even though it had more than its fair share of flaws, you could see its potential. Over the next couple of years, Samsung refined its flagship foldable with things like IPX8 water resistance, a more durable design and native stylus support. More recently, however, the pace of innovation has started to slow as more iterative improvements and fewer major upgrades have come to fill out the spec sheet. It's a similar situation on the new Galaxy Z Fold 5: While many of its upgrades including the brighter main screen are nice to have, they’re also kind of superfluous. Even the one big change for 2023 – Samsung’s new Flex hinge – doesn’t really change the way you use the device; it just makes it a bit thinner. When you consider that the price still sits at $1,800, it feels like Samsung’s Z Fold line – and possibly the category as a whole – is losing momentum.</p><h2>Design and display</h2><p>The Z Fold 5 was built on the same basic blueprint as its predecessors. It packs a skinny but tall exterior Cover Screen and opens up to reveal a big main display with a  fingerprint sensor built into its power button. The major change this year is Samsung’s Flex hinge, which is based on a two-rail internal structure that’s not only smaller than before, but also eliminates the gap between the phone when closed.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="4aa6cc12645b44bcbdebe4107e9c311c"></div><p></p><p>This is something Z Fold users have been requesting since the original. In addition to slimming the phone down to just 13.4mm, losing that gap also reduces the chance that dust or rocks can get inside and ruin that fancy flexible screen. But that’s not all. Samsung says its Flex hinge creates a new waterdrop-shaped crease that puts less stress on the display, which is good for long-term durability. It also helps keep the factory-installed screen protector in place, which was <a href="https://gizmodo.com/life-with-a-foldable-phone-is-a-game-changer-with-one-t-1847439973">an issue</a> on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/z-fold-3-long-term-durability-report-heres-what-samsung-still-cant-get-right-130053466.html">previous models</a>.</p><p>The new hinge also makes the device more pleasant to use and hold. The thinner hinge fits better in your hand when the phone is closed and it opens more smoothly, too. I just wish it hadn’t taken five generations to get here. Meanwhile, Samsung managed to increase the brightness of the main display to 1,750 nits, which is the same as the S23 Ultra and brighter than the Pixel Fold (1,450 nits). So while the flexible display on Google’s foldable is good, the Z Fold 5’s is better. It’s the perfect size and orientation for reading ebooks or browsing comics, and I’d argue that Samsung’s flagship foldable is the best device for playing <em>Marvel Snap. </em>You can still use a stylus to draw or take notes and the Z Fold 5’s new S Pen is 40 percent thinner than before. But since there’s still no room inside the phone to stash it when it’s not in use, you’ll probably want to pair it with one of Samsung’s new <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f85e63cd-e13c-4f9d-991c-9fbaadede3ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Samsung+Electronics&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmODVlNjNjZC1lMTNjLTRmOWQtOTkxYy05ZmJhYWRlZGUzYWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2Ftc3VuZy5jb20vdXMvbW9iaWxlL21vYmlsZS1hY2Nlc3Nvcmllcy9waG9uZXMvZ2FsYXh5LXotZm9sZDUtc2xpbS1zLXBlbi1jYXNlLXNhbmQtZWYtb2Y5NHBjdWVndXMvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5MDA2MmY0Yi1kYmFkLTRiNTMtYjE4Mi0zMWY1NDgyYzNmNWIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAT6OKEfYbC8NW1legKQ8cTgwNVc_lXNi6uLy610Q945k&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fmobile%2Fmobile-accessories%2Fphones%2Fgalaxy-z-fold5-slim-s-pen-case-sand-ef-of94pcuegus%2F">Slim S Pen cases</a>.</p><h2>Performance and multitasking</h2><figure><img alt="The Z Fold 5's 6.2-inch Cover Screen is essentially the same as on last year's phone. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/1709cc90-36b6-11ee-bf7f-f4b20ae1aa8d" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Last year’s model was far from slow, but thanks to a new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy chip, the Z Fold 5 is now even faster. In traditional benchmarks, it posted notably higher multicore scores in Geekbench 6 than the Pixel Fold (5,362 vs 3,226). The Z Fold 5 feels incredibly responsive and in games, graphics and animations are downright silky. That means if you’re the kind of power user who demands an abundance of speed regardless of what you’re doing, the Z Fold 5 is the better pick over the Pixel Fold, whose Tensor G2 chip reserves more horsepower for AI tasks.</p><p>Samsung has also enhanced mobile productivity in three ways. To make it faster and easier to launch into side-by-side app mode, a new gesture lets you swipe in from the side of the screen with two fingers to instantly switch into dual-pane mode. Alternatively, if you want to turn a full-screen app to a windowed one, just swipe diagonally down from one of the top two corners. Both gestures are super handy and they’re a breeze to use. But they’re not on by default, so remember to activate them in the Advanced features tab in settings.</p><figure><img alt="The Z Fold 5's new Flex hinge allowed Samsung to both make the phone thinner and eliminate the gap inside it when closed. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/a5a20650-3640-11ee-b7fb-f8125dcb3592" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>The other update is that the Z Fold 5’s taskbar can now show up to four recent apps instead of two. It’s a simple but straightforward change that takes better advantage of the width of the Z Fold 5’s big main display. My only gripe is that the expanded taskbar and the added gestures are software updates, so we didn’t need a brand new device to get them. That said, compared to the Pixel Fold, which takes a more streamlined approach to multitasking, Samsung’s desktop-like taskbar remains the best for anyone who wants to use their phone like a PC. And don’t forget that Samsung’s handy Dex mode is still around, too.</p><h2>Cameras</h2><p>The Z Fold 5 has the same imaging setup as its predecessor: a 50-megapixel main camera, a 12MP ultra-wide and a 10MP telephoto with a 3x optical zoom in the back, plus a 10MP selfie shooter and a 4MP camera beneath the main display. In a vacuum, they’re more than capable of taking a good picture in practically any environment. However, when you consider that the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-specs-price-photo-and-video-take-center-stage-140034341.html">S23 Ultra</a> costs $600 less and comes with a 200MP main sensor and a 10x optical zoom lens, that puts Samsung’s most expensive phone in a weird position.</p><figure><img alt="One disappointment is that the Galaxy Z Fold 5's cameras are largely unchanged from its predecessor. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/3a569130-3641-11ee-b9af-39f897b8581e" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>What makes things even more awkward is that the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-fold-review-the-challenger-that-samsung-needs-specs-price-170003458.html">Pixel Fold</a> sports a longer zoom (5x vs 3x) and better overall image processing. In my testing, that made the Pixel the more adept shooter across a variety of conditions.</p><p>In bright light, the Z Fold 5 captured images with Samsung’s typical rich, saturated color profile. The downside is this sometimes results in a small loss of detail, occasional blown-out highlights and slightly less accurate hues. Meanwhile in low light, Samsung’s Night Mode does a good job of improving exposure without a ton of side effects. That said, thanks to Google’s Night Sight, photos from the Pixel Fold are often just a touch brighter and sharper. A good example is a shot I took of some flowers at night, in which the Z Fold 5’s picture boasts more vivid colors while missing some of the finer texture on the petals.</p><h2>Battery life</h2><p>Despite having a smaller battery than the Pixel Fold (4,400 mAh vs 4,800 mAh), the Z Fold 5 lasts longer. In our video rundown test, Samsung’s phone lasted 19 hours and 48 minutes when using its main display and an impressive 23:10 with its Cover Screen. On both counts, that’s better than Pixel Fold, which posted a time of 15:22 with its internal screen and 22:21 with its exterior panel.</p><figure><img alt="The ability for the Z Fold 5 to close completely flat doesn't sound like a big change, but it is because it should improve durability while also putting less stress on the screen when it folds. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/d4d1cc30-3640-11ee-bdee-af352764bea2" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>The Z Fold 5’s charging speed has stayed the same with 25-watt wired charging, 15-watt wireless charging and 5-watt power sharing (aka reverse wireless charging). That’s serviceable, but once again, the less expensive S23 Ultra can do better, with the ability to go up to 45 watts when plugged in.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>As someone who’s still optimistic about foldable devices and has owned the last three generations of Samsung’s flagship flexible phone, I can't help but like the Z Fold 5. It’s faster and sleeker, with a brighter main display and even longer battery life than before. The question I wrestle with is how many tweaks and updates should we really expect from a device now in its fifth generation.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="The Z Fold 5 is hands-down the best device for playing Marvel Snap. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/3df57bb0-36b6-11ee-9af5-a81f23379b9e" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>The Z Fold 5 has matured a lot since that initial concept device came out back in 2019, and Samsung’s new Flex Hinge is an important milestone that people like me have been waiting for. But in the end, there’s not a ton the phone can do now that it couldn’t before. It’s just a bit leaner, as if the old model spent the last 12 months in the gym. And with a price that’s still extremely high, I don’t think the Z Fold 5 is doing enough to woo anyone who's not already sold on foldables.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/galaxy-z-fold-5-review-five-years-in-samsung-is-treading-water-140002461.html?src=rss

<p>A series of missteps put Microsoft in second place before the Xbox One even came out.

Both are well-priced, well-specced consoles with a huge library of games spanning two decades.</p><p>Microsoft’s console strategy is unique. Someone with a 7-year old Xbox One has access to an almost-identical library of games as the owner of a brand-new Xbox Series X. That makes it difficult to maintain meaningfully different lists for its various consoles — at least for now. But while next-gen exclusives may be few and far between, with PS4 outselling Xbox One by a reported two-to-one, there are a lot of gamers who simply haven’t experienced much of what Microsoft has had to offer since the mid ‘10s.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It’s with that frame of mind that we approach this list: What are the best games we would recommend to someone picking up an Xbox today — whether it’s a Series X, a Series S, One X or One S — after an extended break from Microsoft’s consoles?</p><p>This list then, is a mixture of games exclusive to Microsoft’s consoles and cross-platform showstoppers that play best on Xbox. We’ve done our best to explain the benefits Microsoft’s systems bring to the table where appropriate. Oh, and while we understand some may have an aversion to subscription services, it’s definitely worth considering <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy54Ym94LmNvbS9lbi11cy9nYW1lcy9zdG9yZS94Ym94LWdhbWUtcGFzcy11bHRpbWF0ZS9jZnE3dHRjMGtoczA_IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwYTZlNmVkYi00YjM2LTQyOTAtYjVlNS1hNDRhYmI2MDI0YzgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAATA7cFPYXyTkpJeNab6R9hJfA-cPdcZE-1KJNU5fwe8R&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fxbox-game-pass-ultimate%2Fcfq7ttc0khs0%3F">Game Pass Ultimate</a>, which will allow you to play many of the games on this list for a monthly fee.</p><h2>Deathloop</h2><p></p><p><em>Deathloop</em>, from the studio that brought you the Dishonored series, is easy enough to explain: You’re trapped in a day that repeats itself. If you die, then you go back to the morning, to repeat the day again. If you last until the end of the day, you still repeat it again. Colt must “break the loop” by efficiently murdering seven main characters, who are inconveniently are never in the same place at the same time. It’s also stylish, accessible and fun.</p><p>While you try to figure out your escape from this time anomaly, you’ll also be hunted down by Julianna, another island resident who, like you, is able to remember everything that happens in each loop. She’ll also lock you out of escaping an area, and generally interfere with your plans to escape the time loop. (The online multiplayer is also addictive, flipping the roles around. You play as Julianna, hunting down Colt and foiling his plans for murder. )</p><p>As you play through the areas again (and again) you’ll equip yourself with slabs that add supernatural powers, as well as more potent weapons and trinkets to embed into both guns and yourself. It’s through this that you’re able to customize your playstyle or equip yourself in the best way to survive Julianna and nail that assassination. Each time period and area rewards repeat exploration, with secret guns, hidden conversations with NPCs and lots of world-building lore to discover for yourself.</p><p>Originally a timed PlayStation exclusive, Deathloop landed on Xbox in September 2022.</p><h2>Overwatch 2</h2><p></p><p>Even though Blizzard has improved the onramp for new players this time around, <em>Overwatch 2 </em>still has a steep learning curve. Stick with it, though, and you’ll get to indulge in perhaps the best team shooter around. <em>Overwatch 2</em> has a deceptively simple goal — stand on or near an objective and keep the other team away long enough to win. It’s much more complex in practice. To the untrained eye, matches may seem like colorful chaos, but <em>Overwatch 2</em> has a deceptively simple goal — stand on or near an objective and keep the other team away long enough to win.</p><p>It’s much more complex in practice. Blizzard reduced the number of players on each team from six to five. That, along with across-the-board character tweaks, has made gameplay faster-paced and more enjoyable compared with the original <em>Overwatch</em>. There's a greater emphasis on individual impact, but you'll still need to work well with your teammates to secure a victory.</p><p>Now featuring a cast of more than 30 heroes, each with distinct abilities and playstyles, you’ll surely find a few <em>Overwatch 2</em> characters that you can connect with. The first batch of new heroes are all a blast to play. There are many great (though often fairly expensive) new skins to kit them out with too. The game looks and sounds terrific too, thanks to Blizzard’s trademark level of polish. At least until you figure out how to play <em>Overwatch 2</em>, you can marvel at how good it looks.</p><h2>Elden Ring</h2><p></p><p>Why would we not include <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9FbGRlbi1SaW5nLVhib3gtT25lL2RwL0IwN1NNQk5UU0ovP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWRzLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwYTZlNmVkYi00YjM2LTQyOTAtYjVlNS1hNDRhYmI2MDI0YzgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAY-rc5BHiScd9EazPcIS1hbKT5FMEEvNJdS1NGHDyK8W&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FElden-Ring-Xbox-One%2Fdp%2FB07SMBNTSJ%2F"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>? The strengths of FromSoftware’s latest action-RPG are many, but what’s most impressive about the game is how hand-crafted it feels despite its scale. <em>Elden Ring</em> is big, but it never feels like it’s wasting your time. Far from it; FromSoftware has created a rich open world, with something surprising, delightful or utterly terrifying around every corner. I’ll never forget the moment I found a chest that teleported my character to a cave full of Eldritch monsters. <em>Elden Ring </em>is full of those kinds of discoveries.</p><p>And if you’re worried about hitting a brick wall with <em>Elden Ring’s</em> difficulty, don’t be. Sure, it can be tough as nails, but it’s also From’s most accessible game to date as well. If you find combat overly punishing, go for a mage build and blast your enemies from afar, complete side quests and more. And if all else fails, one of the rewards for exploring <em>Elden Ring’s </em>world is experience that you can use to make your character stronger.</p><h2>Control</h2><p></p><p>Take the weird <em>Twin Peaks</em> narrative of <em>Alan Wake</em>, smash it together with <em>Quantum Break</em>'s frenetic powers and gunplay, and you've got <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDhTWjFGNUZCP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWRzLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwYTZlNmVkYi00YjM2LTQyOTAtYjVlNS1hNDRhYmI2MDI0YzgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAb-mT1O2eoop_v7mVo5v6CzIKruanvg2dh0vXqu3y2Tg&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08SZ1F5FB"><em>Control</em></a>.

It's also a prime example of a studio working at their creative heights, both refining and evolving the open-world formula that's dominated games for the past decade.</p><p><em>Control</em> on the last-gen Xbox is a mixed affair, with the One S struggling a little, but the One X being head-and-shoulders above the PS4 Pro when it comes to fidelity and smoothness. With the launch of the next-gen consoles, an ‘Ultimate Edition’ emerged which brought the ray-tracing and higher frame rates that PC gamers enjoyed to console players. Although you’ll only get those benefits as a next-gen owner, it also includes all the released DLC and is the edition we recommend buying, even if you’re not planning to immediately upgrade.</p><h2>Dead Space</h2><p></p><p>The<em>&nbsp;</em><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9EZWFkLVNwYWNlLVhib3gtWC9kcC9CMEJHVzg2UkJOP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWRzLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwYTZlNmVkYi00YjM2LTQyOTAtYjVlNS1hNDRhYmI2MDI0YzgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWWqf65aJ4uaJUoFOgPil2Yu9WlulNTmwpzVKfhVMEtJ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDead-Space-Xbox-X%2Fdp%2FB0BGW86RBN"><em>Dead Space remake</em></a> feels like a warm, juicy hug from a murderous necromorph, and we mean that in the best way possible. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dead-space-remake-playstation-5-review-160019905.html">2023 version</a> of <em>Dead Space</em> spit-shines the mechanics that made the original game so magically horrific back in 2008, and it doesn’t add any unnecessary, modern bloat. The remake features full voice acting, new puzzles and expanded storylines, and it introduces a zero-gravity ability that allows the protagonist, Isaac Clarke, to fly through sections of the game in an ultra-satisfying way.</p><p>None of these additions outshine the game’s core loop: <em>stasis, shoot, stomp</em>. Isaac gains the ability to temporarily freeze enemies and he picks up a variety of weapons, but he never feels overpowered; he’s always in danger. Mutilated corpse monsters appear suddenly in the cramped corridors of the space station, charging at Isaac from the shadows, limbs akimbo and begging to be shot off. The first game of <em>Dead Space</em> popularized the idea that headshots don’t matter and the remake stays true to this ethos – yet its combat rhythm still feels fresh.</p><p>The 2023 version of <em>Dead Space</em> proves that innovative game design is timeless (and so are plasma cutters).</p><h2>Halo Infinite</h2><p></p><p>Master Chief's latest adventure may not make much sense narratively, but it sure is fun to play.

The main campaign is more open than ever, while also giving you a new freedom of movement with the trusty grappling hook. And the multiplayer mode is wonderfully addictive (though 343 still needs to speed up experience progression), with a bevy of maps and game modes to keep things from getting too stale. The only thing keeping it from greatness is its baffling and disjointed story, but it's not like Xbox fans have many options when it comes to huge exclusives right now.</p><h2>Forza Horizon 5</h2><p></p><p><a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Gb3J6YS1Ib3Jpem9uLVN0YW5kYXJkLVhib3gtT25lLVgvZHAvQjA5N01HWjdNWT90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1kcy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMGE2ZTZlZGItNGIzNi00MjkwLWI1ZTUtYTQ0YWJiNjAyNGM4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAU0yzKlrsheJOfWA1l8p0TFSvflXUxXjwv8p8r3gYqNN&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FForza-Horizon-Standard-Xbox-One-X%2Fdp%2FB097MGZ7MY"><em>Forza Horizon 5</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>deftly walks a fine line by being an extremely deep and complex racing game that almost anyone can just pick up and play. The game has hundreds of cars that you can tweak endlessly to fit your driving style, and dozens of courses spread all over a gorgeous fictional corner of Mexico. If you crank up the difficulty, one mistake will sink your entire race, and the competition online can be just as fierce.</p><p>But if you’re new to racing games, <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> does an excellent job at getting you up and running. The introduction to the game quickly gives you a taste at the four main race types you’ll come across (street racing, cross-country, etc.), and features like the rewind button mean that you can quickly erase mistakes if you try and take a turn too fast without having to restart your run. Quite simply, <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> is a beautiful and fun game that works for just about any skill level. It’s easy to pick up and play a few races and move on with your day, or you can sink hours into it trying to become the best driver you can possibly be.</p><h2>Gears 5</h2><p></p><p><a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9HZWFycy1XYXItR2FtZS1ZZWFyLURpZ2l0YWwvZHAvQjA4VFM1WDRONz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1kcy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMGE2ZTZlZGItNGIzNi00MjkwLWI1ZTUtYTQ0YWJiNjAyNGM4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAb2XnfHobrWv0cDvjyMrn9_lxbM-mgMUtdIVJprVNais&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGears-War-Game-Year-Digital%2Fdp%2FB08TS5X4N7"><em>Gears 5</em></a> tries to be a lot of things, and doesn't succeed at them all. If you're a Gears of War fan, though, there's a lot to love here. The cover-shooter gameplay the series helped pioneer feels great, and the campaign, while not narratively ambitious, is well-paced and full of bombastic set pieces to keep you interested. As they stand, the various multiplayer modes are not great, but <em>Gears 5</em> is worth it for the campaign alone.</p><p>It’s also a true graphical showcase, among the best-looking console games around.

And boy, was it worth the almost-18-month wait. Nier takes the razor-sharp combat of a Platinum Games title and puts it in a world crafted by everyone's favorite weirdo, Yoko Taro. Don't worry, you can mostly just run, gun and slash your way through the game, but as you finish, and finish and finish this one, you'll find yourself pulled into a truly special narrative, one that's never been done before and will probably never be done again. It’s an unmissable experience, and one that feels all the more unique on Xbox, which has never had the best levels of support from Japanese developers.</p><p>On Xbox One X and Series X, you effectively have the best version of Nier: Automata available, short of a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SpecialK_Mods/discussions/3/1334600128973500691/">fan-patched</a> PC game.

You'll die hundreds of times exploring the titular forest, unlocking skills that allow you to reach new areas. It looks and sounds great — like, Disney great — and its story, while fairly secondary to the experience, is interesting.

You play as Andreas Maler, a young artist from a well-to-do family who gets caught up in a murder mystery while trying to complete his masterpiece. The game itself hinges on its artwork and writing. Both are remarkable: The former is like a medieval manuscript brought to life, while the latter is at once warm and biting, but always in complete control of what it’s trying to say. What starts as a seemingly straightforward whodunit turns into a sweeping, soulful meditation on the nature of history, power, community and truth itself. Time and again, it subverts the “your choices matter!” promise video games have long tried (and mostly failed) to fulfill. You don’t expect one of Microsoft’s best first-party Xbox games to be a riff on Umberto Eco’s <em>The Name of the Rose</em>, but, well, here we are.</p><h2><strong>Hi-Fi Rush</strong></h2><p></p><p><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9IaS1GaS1SVVNILURlbHV4ZS1YYm94LURpZ2l0YWwvZHAvQjBCV0g4REtaMj90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1kcy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMGE2ZTZlZGItNGIzNi00MjkwLWI1ZTUtYTQ0YWJiNjAyNGM4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAX8snM38hLpWDif5gnMP-48ek-l8AYTdKMqwPjegrcom&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHi-Fi-RUSH-Deluxe-Xbox-Digital%2Fdp%2FB0BWH8DKZ2"><em>Hi-Fi Rush</em></a> is a hack-and-slash action game built entirely around its soundtrack. You can move and jump freely, but all of your steps and attacks are timed to the beat of the backing music. If you time your moves right <em>on</em> the beat, you can do more damage and pull off combos. Everything else in the world pulsates and takes action to the same rhythm, from enemy attacks to lights flashing in the background.</p><p>Is this revolutionary? Not really. Every hack-and-slasher has a sense of performance and musicality to it; <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> just makes the subtext explicit. It’s <em>Devil May Cry</em> on a metronome. But it’s fun. Ripping through a room of goons is satisfying in most video games; ripping through them entirely in rhythm, with each dodge and final blow punctuated by a beat, is even more so. It helps that the soundtrack is actually good and that the combat system never punishes you <em>too</em> hard for button mashing in a panic. It also helps that the tone is that of a cel-shaded Saturday morning cartoon, starring a lovable doofus named Chai as he takes on a comically evil megacorp. <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> has issues – its stages can drag, for one – but it plays like a passion project from the PS3/Xbox 360 era. It has ideas, and its main concern is being a good time.</p><h2>Red Dead Redemption 2</h2><p></p><p><a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9SZWQtRGVhZC1SZWRlbXB0aW9uLTItWGJveC1PbmUvZHAvQjAxTUFZQzFDSj90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1kcy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMGE2ZTZlZGItNGIzNi00MjkwLWI1ZTUtYTQ0YWJiNjAyNGM4In0&amp;signature=AQAAATibTCIXYz2C1jYubXuCBIXn0nb7Q1Ez7omtNIcEpnPC&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FRed-Dead-Redemption-2-Xbox-One%2Fdp%2FB01MAYC1CJ"><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em></a> is the kind of game no one but Rockstar, the team behind the Grand Theft Auto series, could make. Only when a studio is this successful can it pour millions of dollars and development hours into a game. Rockstar's simulation of a crumbling frontier world is enthralling and serves as a perfect backdrop to an uncharacteristically measured story. While the studio's gameplay may not have moved massively forward, the writing and characters of RDR2 will stay with you.</p><p>While Rockstar hasn’t deemed fit to properly upgrade <em>Red Dead Redemption 2 </em>for the next-gen yet, Series X owners will at least benefit from the best last-gen (Xbox One X) experience with the addition of improved loading times.

It’s a gothic fairy tale masquerading as a survival-horror game, and while this represents a fresh vibe for the franchise, it’s not an unwelcome evolution. The characters and enemies in Village are full of life — even when they’re decidedly undead — and Capcom has put a delicious twist on the idea of vampires, werewolves, sea creatures, giants and creepy dolls. The game retains its horror, puzzle and action roots, and it has Umbrella Corporation’s fingerprints all over it. It simply feels like developers had fun with this one, and so will you.</p><p>A word of caution before you run to buy it, though: This game doesn’t play great on every Xbox. On Series X, things are great: There's the option to turn on ray-tracing with the occasional frame rate issue, or to keep it off and have perfect 4K/60 presentation. With the Series S, while there is a ray-tracing mode, it’s almost unplayable. With ray-tracing off, the Series S does a decent job, though. The One X’s 1080p/60 mode is also fantastic, although its quality mode feels very juddery. If you own a base Xbox One or One S, though, there’s really no mode that actually feels enjoyable to play.</p><h2>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</h2><p></p><p><a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TZWtpcm8tU2hhZG93cy1Ud2ljZS1EaWdpdGFsLVN0YW5kYXJkL2RwL0IwN1ozWEw0UVA_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZHMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjBhNmU2ZWRiLTRiMzYtNDI5MC1iNWU1LWE0NGFiYjYwMjRjOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAWqL_CsEamZZyAf5YVE3vj3hqm-qVYtRphiN8Dd_IvgE&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSekiro-Shadows-Twice-Digital-Standard%2Fdp%2FB07Z3XL4QP"><em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em></a> isn't just another Dark Souls game. FromSoftware's samurai adventure is a departure from that well-established formula, replacing slow, weighty combat and gothic despair for stealth, grappling hooks and swift swordplay. Oh, and while it's still a difficult game, it's a lot more accessible than Souls games — you can even pause it! The result of all these changes is something that's still instantly recognizable as a FromSoftware title, but it's its own thing, and it's very good.</p><p>This is one game that’s really not had a lot of love from its developer or publisher, as, despite the fact next-gen consoles should be easily able to run this game at 60 fps, the Series S is locked to an inconsistently paced 30 fps, while the Series X doesn’t quite hold to 60 either. With that said, it’s more than playable.</p><h2>Lost Judgment</h2><p></p><p>This is private eye Takayuki Yagami’s <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ffe106af-8248-4af3-9098-a2d4fd637766&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GameStop&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmZmUxMDZhZi04MjQ4LTRhZjMtOTA5OC1hMmQ0ZmQ2Mzc3NjYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2FtZXN0b3AuY29tL3ZpZGVvLWdhbWVzL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2xvc3QtanVkZ21lbnQtLS14Ym94LXNlcmllcy14LzI5MTA3NS5odG1sPyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMGE2ZTZlZGItNGIzNi00MjkwLWI1ZTUtYTQ0YWJiNjAyNGM4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAbUclKxTgGXlHAtfLZeZ1icGRYZts0EQCyjo_Nj7NVIJ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fproducts%2Flost-judgment---xbox-series-x%2F291075.html%3F">second adventure</a>; a spin-off of Sega’s popular, pulpy and convoluted Yakuza saga. He lives in the same Kamurocho area, the same yakuza gangs roam the streets, and there’s the very occasional crossover of side-story characters and, well, weirdos. But instead of punching punks in the face in the name of justice or honor, which was the style of Yakuza<em>&nbsp;</em>protagonist Kazuya Kiryu, Yagami fights with the power of his lawyer badge, drone evidence and… sometimes (read: often) he kicks the bad guys in the face.</p><p>The sequel skates even closer to some sort of serialized TV drama, punctuated by fights, chases and melodrama. For anyone that’s played the series before, it treads familiar ground, but with a more serious (realistic) story that centers on bullying and suicide problems in Japanese high schools, which is tied into myriad plots encompassing the legal system, politics and organized crime.</p><p>Yagami has multiple  fighting styles to master, while there are love interests, batting cages, mahjong, skate parks and more activities to sink even more hours into. On the PS5, <em> Lost Judgment</em> looks great. Fights are fluid and the recreated areas in Tokyo and Yokohama are usually full of pedestrians, stores and points of interest. While <em>Yakuza Like a Drago</em>n takes the franchise in a new (turn-based, more ridiculous) direction, <em>Lost Judgment</em> retains the brawling playstyle of the Yakuza series, with a new hero who has, eventually, charmed us.</p><h2>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</h2><p></p><p>We already mentioned this one but it's difficult to overemphasize how good a deal <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9YYm94LUdhbWUtUGFzcy1VbHRpbWF0ZS1NZW1iZXJzaGlwL2RwL0IwN1RGUDdKRkg_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZHMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjBhNmU2ZWRiLTRiMzYtNDI5MC1iNWU1LWE0NGFiYjYwMjRjOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAbIx13ZjEsaaH0nMgLx2YYuLdPxuDIBtEKFdsJ-lNDuE&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FXbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership%2Fdp%2FB07TFP7JFH">Game Pass</a> is for Xbox owners.

There are 11 games mentioned in this guide, and seven of them are currently available with Game Pass.

## Slack's latest redesign has a dedicated DM tab and a Discord-style Activity view

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/slack/"><ins>Slack</ins></a> is getting a new look starting today. The service is rolling out a redesign aimed at helping folks stay focused and get things done by streamlining the interface.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps the most obvious change is to the sidebar. On the far left, you'll no longer see a tile for each of your workspaces if you're logged in to more than one. Those have been collapsed into a single tile, and Slack is using the freed-up space for new navigation options.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Slack screenshot showing the new redesign, featuring an updated left sidebar with Home, DMs, Activity, Later and More buttons." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/55aec7b0-2fc3-11ee-b3f7-d62516cbe7a4" style="height: 1536px; width: 2048px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Slack</div></figure><p>The sidebar now includes buttons for Home, DMs (direct messages), Activity, Later and More sections, along with a search icon and a new Create button. The Home view is much like the Slack you'll be used to. From here, you'll be able to access your various channels, unread items, drafts, apps and more.</p><p>It looks like the DMs section will neatly bring together your direct message conversations and make them easier to access. Your DM list will show the most recent message from each chat, and you can choose whether to see only unread messages.</p><figure><img alt="Slack screenshot showing the new redesign and a direct messages feed" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/7e574200-2fc3-11ee-ade1-ce16ce1d0b05" style="height: 1536px; width: 2048px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Slack</div></figure><p>The Activity feed combines your threads, mentions and reactions into a single view, though each of those has a dedicated tab within the Activity section. The Later section, meanwhile, has tabs for in-progress, completed and archived actions. The More section is where you'll find tools such as apps and workflows, canvases and huddles.</p><p>As for the Create button, that replaces the draft message option. From here, you can whip up a message, huddle, canvas or new channel. Elsewhere, there's a new feature that allows you to hover over an icon for  one of the dedicated views (i.e. DMs or Activity) to take a peek at what's happening without having to drift away from your current task.</p><p>Slack says it's rolling out some device-specific updates as well. In <a href="https://www.engadget.com/slack-mobile-app-redesign-224859698.html"><ins>the iPhone app</ins></a>, you'll see tiles at the top of the screen that will take you to the likes of your unreads and threads with a single tap. You'll also be able to swipe through all your unreads and perhaps catch up on things more quickly. Last but not least, Slack is enabling new themes with a more detailed and customizable color scheme.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/slacks-latest-redesign-has-a-dedicated-dm-tab-and-a-discord-style-activity-view-130032154.html?src=rss

## Patreon creators can now publish subscriber-only podcasts on Spotify

<p>At its Stream On event earlier this year, Spotify <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-03-08/creator-monetization-make-money-from-podcasts-patreon/">announced a partnership</a> with Patreon that would bring subscriber-only podcasts from the creator platform to its streaming service. Today, <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-08-09/patreon-spotify-connect-exclusive-podcast-patron-member-content-in-feed/">that integration launches</a> for all creators and users globally, allowing patrons to listen to exclusive content alongside other episodes on Spotify. If you stumble upon a show that you don't yet support monetarily, you can get access with a few taps from the show's page inside the streaming app.&nbsp;</p><p>Patreon podcasters only need to sync their account with Spotify to get started. Afterwards, all patron-exclusive content will be on a dedicated page on their Spotify show profile. Creators will have the option of adding promotional banners on their free episodes page to help drive subscription numbers. The integration of Patreon is powered by Spotify's Open Access, which was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-podcast-subscription-platform-120040301.html">first announced in 2021</a>. This technology allows shows that host subscription content on other platforms to use their existing log-in credentials to bring those podcasts to the streaming service. Other integrated platforms include Supporting Cast, Supercast and more. Additionally, Spotify has been offering paid podcast subscriptions through its audio production platform Anchor for over two years.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Just like that Anchor setup, any subscriber-only Patreon podcasts that you don't have access to will show up with a lock icon in the Spotify app. There's also a small &quot;paid&quot; tag next to the publish date and runtime info. When you tap the lock, a pop up will ask if you want to hear more from the creator before sending you to their Patreon page to view subscription info.&nbsp;</p><p>Spotify doesn't take a cut of subscriptions that are generated through Open Access. Patreon and Spotify both explain that creators will retain &quot;full control&quot; over their audiences, content and revenue while using the streaming service to expand their reach. There's no additional cost to integrate Patreon with Spotify either, and creators publishing both free and paid episodes can use the setup.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/patreon-creators-can-now-publish-subscriber-only-podcasts-on-spotify-130016901.html?src=rss

## The best laptops for 2023

<p>You may want to upgrade your tech soon, but buying a new laptop computer can be confusing. There have never been more brands, features and configurations to consider, and given that we're still dealing with inflation, you may also be concerned about rising prices. The good news is, companies are still making a ton of new laptops, and there are a wide range of models for you to choose from the budget HP Pavilion Aero 13 to the convertible Microsoft Surface Pro 9 to our best overall pick of the Apple MacBook Air M2. We've made it less complicated for you to pick out the best laptop for your needs.</p><h2>What to expect</h2><p>You probably have an idea of your budget here, but just so you know, most modern laptops with top-of-the-line specs can cost you around $1,800 to $2,000 these days. That doesn’t mean you won’t find a good system for under $1,000 — a grand is the base price for a lot of high-end ultraportables in the 13-inch category, with chips like Intel’s Core i3 or i5 series. And if that’s too expensive, you’ll still have respectable options in the $600 to $800 range, but they might come with older, slower processors and dimmer screens. I’ve included our favorite budget-friendly model in this best laptop roundup but we have a list of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-laptop-150038435.html">more-affordable laptop picks</a> that you can check out as well.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>After working out how much money you want to spend, the laptop’s operating system is usually the first thing you have to narrow down. As always, the decision is slightly easier for people who prefer an Apple MacBook. Now that the company has brought its M-series chips to its whole lineup — your only real considerations are budget, screen size and how much power you need.</p><p>Over on Team Windows, however, the shift to ARM-based chips hasn’t been as smooth. Though Apple laptops have been able to bring huge increases in battery life while maintaining (and in some cases improving) performance with their own silicon, PC makers have been limited by Windows’ shortcomings. Microsoft released Windows 11 last year, and it’s supposed to run better on ARM-powered machines. Since the first of these laptops, like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-made-its-first-think-pad-powered-by-a-snapdragon-chip-080035789.html">Lenovo’s ThinkPad X13s</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-snapdragon-windows-11-tablet-yoga-laptop-ryzen-virtual-reality-153901587.html">10w tablet</a>, haven’t been available for review yet, we can’t tell how well the system runs. Of course, you can upgrade to Windows 11 on existing ARM-based PCs, but for now, it’s still safer to stick with an Intel or AMD processor.</p><figure><img alt="Dell XPS 13" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/98e7c4a0-eb92-11ea-b3fb-e2e6726b0a03" /><figcaption>Devindra Hardawar / Engadget 
 </figcaption></figure><p>Let’s not forget there’s a third and fairly popular laptop operating system: Chrome OS. If you do most of your work in a browser (lots of online research, emails and Google Drive), then a Chromebook might be a suitable, and often more affordable option.</p><p>As for other things to look out for when shopping for the best laptop, it’s worth pointing out that some of the latest models coming out this year have done away with headphone jacks. Though this doesn’t seem to be a prevalent trend yet, it’s a good reminder to check that a machine has all the connectors you need (otherwise, you'll need to plan to buy the necessary adapters). Most laptops in 2022 offer WiFi 6 or 6E and Bluetooth 5.0 or later, which should mean faster and more stable connections if you have compatible routers and devices. While 5G coverage is more widespread this year, whether you need support for that depends on how much you travel.</p><p><strong>See Also:</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-laptops-172033838.html"><strong>Best Gaming Laptops for 2023</strong></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-affordable-windows-laptops-123000512.html"><strong>Best Cheap Windows Laptops</strong></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-2-in-1-laptops-173038508.html"><strong>Best 2-in-1 Laptops for 2023</strong></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-chromebooks-160054646.html"><strong>Best Chromebooks</strong></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-laptops-for-students-130054631.html"><strong>Best Laptops for College Students</strong></a></p></li></ul><p>Where you plan on taking your laptop also helps in deciding what size to get. Many companies launched new 14-inch machines in the last year, straddling the line between ultraportable and bulkier 15-inch laptops. For most people, a 14-inch screen is a great middle ground. But if you’re worried about weight and want a more portable laptop, a 12- or 13-inch model will be better. Those that want more powerful processors and larger displays will prefer 15- or 16-inch versions.</p><h2>Best overall: MacBook Air M2</h2><p></p><p>As a Windows user, I find myself reluctant to name an Apple MacBook the best overall laptop. But I can’t deny that Apple’s transition to its own Silicon has made its machines better.

We found it to be impressively fast, and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-air-m2-review-2022-130040098.html">M2</a> only builds on top of that excellent performance. It's probably overkill for a MacBook Air, but that means it will serve most people well for both work and play. Plus, its impressive 16.5-hour long battery life should be enough for anyone to get a day's worth of work and then some.</p><p>As for its design, we like that Apple took a more uniformly thin approach here and retired the wedge shape of the previous model. The MacBook Air M2 also has a lovely 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display, interrupted only by the top notch which holds its 1080p webcam. Its quad-speaker setup is an improvement as well, and all of these small hardware changes add up to a machine that looks and feels more different than you may expect from its predecessor.</p><p>The 13-inch Air is certainly the way to go for anyone that prizes portability above all else. However, if slightly more screen real estate is tempting to you, don't sleep on the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9hdy9kL0IwQzc2ODYxNjkvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTJyLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5OWE3ZmIwOC1iNGNiLTM1OTgtODkwYy02ZjZkODc4MzM5YjEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUinCg4nIHk5XD9rQaa96mIPpgmlGpj1yku7Ck3uFQt9&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Faw%2Fd%2FB0C7686169%2F">15-inch MacBook Air M2</a>.

It doesn't side-step the very Apple issue of having a little less RAM and storage than we'd prefer in its base model (8GB, 256GB SSD), but that doesn't hold it back. It's one of the best MacBooks we've used recently and it gives fans of the Air lineup a new configuration to consider.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-air-m2-review-2022-130040098.html"><strong>Read our Full Review of the 13-inch MacBook Air M2 </strong></a></p><h2>Best Windows: Dell XPS 13 Plus</h2><p></p><p>Our top pick for the best Windows laptop has long been Dell’s well-rounded <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=b1bb23c9-a2d4-4e4e-bfac-7a560ebe7641&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Dell&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJiMWJiMjNjOS1hMmQ0LTRlNGUtYmZhYy03YTU2MGViZTc2NDEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGVsbC5jb20vZW4tdXMvc2hvcC9kZWxsLWxhcHRvcHMveHBzLTEzLWxhcHRvcC9zcGQveHBzLTEzLTkzMTUtbGFwdG9wL3huOTMxNWN0bzAzMHMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijk5YTdmYjA4LWI0Y2ItMzU5OC04OTBjLTZmNmQ4NzgzMzliMSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAASAyWkI2s05Ra2lkX3olOfFRY0TI8CiN9aUimAjn8B5N&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdell-laptops%2Fxps-13-laptop%2Fspd%2Fxps-13-9315-laptop%2Fxn9315cto030s">XPS 13 series</a> and it remains the best laptop for anyone that doesn't want a Mac.

Its 4GB of RAM and 64GB SSD may sound meager, but in our testing the Flex 5 held up in spite of this constraint. It’s also nice to see one USB-A and two USB-C ports, eight hours of battery life and a 360-degree hinge that makes it easy to use the Flex 5 as a tablet.

Considering you'll pay at least $1,000 for any Surface Pro 9 model, you might as well get a configuration that has as few limitations as possible.</p><p>While we have our gripes about the Pro 9's overall ergonomics, it's undoubtedly one of the thinnest and lightest laptop alternatives you can get. It's attractive and has a gorgeous 13-inch display, and we still consider Microsoft's Type Cover to be one of the best you can get, period. They will cost you extra, though, so be prepared to shell out another $100 to $180 for one. Microsoft's Slim Pen 2 is another highlight, and it will be a must-buy stylus for anyone that loves to draw or prefers to take handwritten notes. Overall, if you want a machine that can switch seamlessly from being a laptop to being a tablet, the Intel Surface Pro 9 is one of your best bets. Of course, if you're married to the Apple ecosystem, you should consider an iPad Pro.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/surface-pro-9-5g-review-sq3-arm-173012304.html"><strong>Read our Full Review of Microsoft Surface Pro 9</strong></a></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-laptops-120008636.html?src=rss

It also expects its net income to be 2.4 percent higher than its previous forecast, from 840 billion yen ($5.86 billion) to 860 billion ($6 billion).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For its game division, in particular, Sony has tweaked its forecast, because it's anticipating an increase in sales for non-first-party <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ps5-cloud-game-streaming-begins-rolling-out-to-beta-testers-190938931.html">PlayStation</a> titles, including add-on content. Several much-awaited games are coming out for PlayStation gamers this year, such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-spider-man-2-story-trailer-teases-more-venom-more-villains-and-more-drama-040056520.html"><em>Spider-Man 2</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/assassins-creed-mirage-will-arrive-on-october-12-205552847.html"><em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-will-take-you-back-to-night-city-on-september-26th-181652972.html"><em>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty Expansion</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-launch-date-sgf-2023-174516354.html"><em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ea-sports-fc-24-will-hit-consoles-and-pc-on-september-29th-182429306.html"><em>EA Sports FC</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>This expected increase in sales for non-first-party titles will be aided by a decrease in costs and expenses. That said, they will also offset by a "deterioration in profitability of PlayStation 5 hardware." Sony has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonys-disc-based-playstation-5-falls-back-to-449-093647320.html">dropped the PS5's pricing</a> in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23802839/ps5-sale-price-drop-sony-playstation">several regions</a> around the world recently. While that translates to lower overall earnings from the console, it could also get people on the fence to finally purchase the PS5, which in turn could lead to more game purchases.&nbsp;</p><p>To note, Sony has shipped 3.3 million PS5 units in the first quarter of the year. That's almost half of the previous quarter's sales of 6.3 million units, though that figure was for the holiday season, when businesses typically do better than usual. This is Sony's best-performing first quarter for PS5 sales so far, bringing the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-has-sold-over-40-million-ps5-consoles-150040065.html">total number of units sold</a> to 41.7 million.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite adjusting its outlook with better numbers for the year overall, Sony has lowered its expectations for the sales of mobile sensors due to the continuing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/18/a-12-decline-in-global-smartphone-shipments-is-what-passes-for-stability-these-days/">downward trend in smartphone sales</a>. Sony Pictures' earnings was also down year-on-year despite the success of <em>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</em>. The company doesn't foresee a recovery for the business, as well, and believes it will perform worse than what was predicted last April due to the impact of strikes by the Writers Guild of America and the Screen Actors Guild.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/sony-raises-its-annual-forecast-on-the-strength-of-its-playstation-sales-113514305.html?src=rss

The agency lost touch with the probe on July 21st after a series of planned maneuvers pointed it two degrees away from Earth. It would have reset its orientation in October, but agency officials didn’t want to wait that long to get back in touch.</p><p>The Voyager 2 team used a network of ground-based transmitters to “shout” a command to the probe, telling it to turn back toward Earth. This bellowed order took 18.5 hours to reach the apparatus, and it would take just as long before NASA would learn it was successful. It’s a testament to human ingenuity, but also a vital reminder to not miss a second of data coming from Voyager 2 since NASA believes it may not function properly after 2025.</p><p>— Dan Cooper</p><p></p><p><em>You can get these reports delivered daily, direct to your inbox. </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em><ins>Subscribe right here!</ins></em></a>​​​​</p><h3>The biggest stories you might have missed</h3><p></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-games-for-ps5-playstation-5-171511880.html"><ins>The best PS5 games for 2023</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/marvels-visual-effects-workers-vote-to-join-a-union-123036176.html"><ins>Marvel's visual effects workers vote to unionize</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-will-enable-vehicle-to-home-charging-on-all-ultium-based-evs-164248583.html"><ins>GM will enable vehicle-to-home charging on all Ultium-based EVs</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/valve-begins-selling-refurbished-steam-decks-for-around-20-percent-off-201808966.html"><ins>Valve sells refurbished Steam Decks for around 20 percent off</ins></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/why-humans-cant-use-natural-language-processing-to-speak-with-the-animals-143050169.html"><ins>Why humans can't use natural language processing to speak with the animals</ins></a></h2><h3>The complexities of speech are nothing compared to birdsong.</h3><p></p><p>Surely computers, as powerful as they are these days, are smart enough to decode simple animal calls?

## 'Alien' is coming to 'Dead by Daylight'

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/looks-like-the-xenomorph-from-alien-will-be-dead-by-daylights-next-killer-170828650.html"><em>Dead by Daylight</em></a> has a new Killer in town, and it's one all horror fans know (and likely fear): the Xenomorph. Behaviour Interactive has released all of the details of its <a href="https://forums.bhvr.com/dead-by-daylight/kb/articles/402-7-2-0-ptb">new <em>Alien</em> collaboration</a> following a teaser that provided a glimpse into the new Nostromo Wreckage Map. The announcement confirmed not only the Xenomorph's role as <em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s latest Killer but also the introduction of Ellen Ripley as a Survivor.&nbsp;</p><p>This edition introduces seven Control Stations, a new Map feature that allows Survivors to get a Remote Flame Turret (another addition), which they can use to stagger <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ripley-xenomorph-alien-fortnite-165433950.html">the Xenomorph</a> — though the Killer can destroy the tool. It can also stop the Xenomorph's unique Power known as Runner Mode, which lets it walk on four legs and shrinks its Terror Radius.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The control stations sit on top of tunnels that the Xenomorph can enter and exit through. &quot;Creating the Xenomorph's Tunnel system was very challenging as we had never created a sublevel that could only be accessible to the Killer. This new mechanic grants it Map-wide mobility and definitely amps up the scare factor – which feels very connected to the original character,&quot; said Janick Neveu, Game Designer on <em>Dead by Daylight</em>.</p><div id="42c797345b424eb8a541f02c8d4e8562"></div><p>You don't have to wait long to wander through the Nostromo Wreckage in total fear (a perfect nighttime game, right?) as <em>Dead by Daylight: Alien</em> will be available across platforms starting August 29th. Impatient? You can already download the game's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dead-by-daylight-dating-sim-attack-on-titan-resident-evil-184556465.html">Public Test Build</a> and try it out early.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/alien-is-coming-to-dead-by-daylight-105502420.html?src=rss

## Take-Two CEO says $50 for 'Red Dead Redemption' port is 'great value'

<p>There's good news if you felt thrown by the $50 price tag for 13-year-old <a href="https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/1688552977508806656"><em>Red Dead Redemption</em>'s Nintendo Switch and PS4 release</a>: Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick says the cost is right. Seriously, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-red-dead-redemption-port-pricing-is-commercially-accurate"><em>IGN reports</em></a> that Zelnick had his reasons, which he clearly laid out after the company's Q2 earnings report, &quot;That's just what we believe is the commercially accurate price for it.&quot; Satisfied now?&nbsp;</p><p>Points of frustration around <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>'s sticker price are extensive, including the lack of a multiplayer option and a complete lack of a quality update since its 2010 release (no 4K visuals in sight). There's also the small matter that the game is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-10-xbox-one-x-upgrades-for-red-dead-redemption-and-portal-2.html">already available on Xbox Series X</a> in 4K for $40.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Take-Two is leaning on the inclusion of <em>Undead Nightmare</em>, a <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> expansion, in the port as a rationale for the higher price. Zelnick called Undead Nightmare &quot;a great standalone game in its own right when it was originally released, so we feel like it's a great bundle for the first time, and certainly a great value for consumers.&quot;&nbsp;</p><div id="e0aa4d1770374758bd25f6b28d892f7f"></div><p>If the words of a CEO have convinced you to pay $50 for <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, you can buy the digital version for the Nintendo Switch or PS4 starting August 17th, with a physical release to follow on October 13th.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/take-two-ceo-says-50-for-red-dead-redemption-port-is-great-value-093553782.html?src=rss

## ISS experiment will help scientists work out how to keep astronauts cool in space

<p>On August 4th, Northrop Grumman's 19th resupply mission for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-is-recycling-98-percent-of-astronaut-pee-and-sweat-on-the-iss-into-drinkable-water-184332789.html">ISS</a> arrived on the orbiting lab, carrying not just necessities for its inhabitants, but also <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2023/Q3/science-enabling-heat-and-air-conditioning-for-long-term-space-habitats-is-almost-fully-available.html">an experiment</a> that could greatly benefit future human colonies outside our planet. Specifically, the mission was carrying a module with hardware that could help us understand how heating and air conditioning systems can operate in reduced gravity and in the extreme temperatures observed on the moon and Mars. Daytime temperatures near the lunar equator, for instance, reach 250 degrees Fahrenheit, which is higher than the boiling point of water. At night, temperatures reach -208 degrees Fahrenheit. The <a href="https://wmo.asu.edu/content/world-lowest-temperature">lowest recorded temperature on Earth</a> was -128.6 degrees Fahrenheit back in 1983.</p><p>The hardware was designed and built by scientists and engineers from Purdue University and NASA's Glenn Research Center in Cleveland. It will allow Purdue scientists to conduct the second part of their Flow Boiling and Condensation Experiment (FBCE), which has been collecting data aboard the ISS since 2021. They've already finished gathering data for the first part of their study that focuses on measuring the effects of reduced gravity on boiling. This part will now focus on investigating how condensation works in a reduced-gravity environment.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Issam Mudawar, the Purdue professor in charge of experiment, explained: &quot;We have developed over a hundred years' worth of understanding of how heat and cooling systems work in Earth’s gravity, but we haven’t known how they work in weightlessness.&quot;</p><p>His team has published over 60 research papers on reduced gravity and fluid flow from the data they've collected so far, and they're in the midst of preparing more. They believe that in addition to providing the information needed to enable human colonies to live on the moon and on the red planet, their experiment could also provide the scientific understanding to enable spacecraft to travel longer distances and to refuel in orbit.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/iss-experiment-will-help-scientists-work-out-how-to-keep-astronauts-cool-in-space-081822506.html?src=rss

## Author says the Apple TV+ 'Tetris' movie ripped off his book

<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-tetris-movie-chronicles-the-cold-war-clash-between-communism-and-capitalism-163024019.html">Apple TV+ film Tetris</a> was copied from a book written years ago, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/apples-tetris-movie-ripped-off-tech-writers-book-lawsuit-says-2023-08-08/">a lawsuit filed against</a> the tech giant and the Tetris Company. Dan Ackerman, the editor-in-chief of <em>Gizmodo</em>, has accused the plaintiffs of ripping off his book <em>The Tetris Effect</em>, which tells the history of the game in the form of a Cold War-era thriller. In his <a href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/mopajkzbgva/APPLE%20TETRIS%20LAWSUIT%20complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> (PDF, via <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/apples-tetris-movie-ripped-off-tech-writers-book-lawsuit-says-2023-08-08/"><em>Reuters</em></a>), Ackerman said he sent the Tetris Company and its CEO Maya Rogers a pre-publication copy of his book back in 2016. Later that year, his agent received a &quot;strongly worded Cease and Desist letter&quot; to stop him from pursuing film and TV opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>Ackerman accused Rogers of working with screenwriter Noah Pink to develop a screenplay using content taken from his book without his knowledge or consent. Apparently, numerous producers showed interest in adapting his book, but the Tetris Company refused to license its IP for the project. &quot;This was done at the direction and behest of Ms. Rogers so that she and the Tetris Company could pursue their own project and opportunities based on Mr. Ackerman's book without compensating him,&quot; the lawsuit reads.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In his complaint, Ackerman explained that for writers, the option to license their work for film and TV is typically a major source of revenue. That's why he takes the Tetris Company's actions not as a means to prevent the unauthorized use of its IP, but as an &quot;economic attack&quot; on his business. To drive the point home, Ackerman included quite a lengthy list of &quot;glaring similarities&quot; between his book and the film in his lawsuit. Several items in the list explain how scenes in the movie mirrored his versions of events. That said, those events were based on scenarios that happened in real life, so it remains to be seen if the court will agree with him. Ackerman is asking for actual, compensatory and punitive damages equivalent to 6 percent of the film's $80 million production budget.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/author-says-the-apple-tv-tetris-movie-ripped-off-his-book-061744399.html?src=rss
