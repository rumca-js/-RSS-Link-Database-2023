I had no idea if Werner survived in real life, was disfigured or even died \u2013 it was possible Beard was entering the thoughts of a man in his last moments, or imagining them for us, and this seemed so unbearable I put the book down and walked away from one of the best writers at work today.

Warning: you will spoil your reading of Jo Ann Beard if you break the circumference of her prose. The essay relates facts so random and extreme it makes you query the process of reading itself.
