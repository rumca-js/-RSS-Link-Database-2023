Before people could take in what was happening in Zhuozhou, the center of the rainstorm pounced on the Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces in northeastern China. Heilongjiang, a well-known grain belt in China, received a record rainfall of 346.8 millimeters, flooding a large number of rice paddies. 
Four rivers in Heilongjiang experienced flooding. The first flood of the year occurred in the Mudanjiang River in the early hours of August 4. The flooding was so powerful that entire houses were washed away, and many villages were inundated.
