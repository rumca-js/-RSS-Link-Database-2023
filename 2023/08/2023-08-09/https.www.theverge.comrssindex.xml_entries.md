  <p id="aiuECf">A woman in British Columbia, Canada, has received over 50 Amazon packages that she’s never asked for, as <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/amazon-shoe-packages-1.6926200">reported by <em>CBC</em></a>. As a result of getting these shipments, which she hasn’t had the chance to refuse upon arrival, the United Parcel Service (UPS) has sent her customs bills for more than $300.</p>
<p id="6vS6rE">“They keep coming and it just doesn’t end,” Anca Nitu said to <em>CBC</em>. Nitu told the news outlet that it’s somehow tied to her own Amazon account — one that she said has been sitting dormant.</p>
<div id="SFYbiY"></div>
<p id="LdPbju">Amazon told <em>CBC</em> in a written statement that Nitu’s case has been addressed and “corrective action” is being taken. The company advises anyone receiving packages unexpectedly to report it using the Report Unwanted Package form online.</p>

  <p id="gCcqyx">Disney is once again raising the ad-free prices of both Disney Plus and Hulu this fall. Beginning on October 12th, Disney Plus will cost $13.99 per month, while Hulu’s no-ads tier will run $17.99. The ad-sponsored tiers of both services will (for now) each remain $7.99. </p>
<p id="pRztDH">Perhaps to ease that blow, the company is introducing a new combo subscription that will bundle ad-free experiences for both Disney Plus and Hulu for $19.99 per month. That plan will be available on September 6th. </p>
<p id="wNdqHt">But these subscription hikes to the standalone services are substantial; Disney last raised the cost of Disney Plus to $10.99 / month <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/10/23300460/disney-plus-price-increase-ads-streaming">a year ago</a>.

Bumble’s president, Tariq Shaukat, has also said the company is using AI to “remove some of the friction” of dating. For Bumble, that means improving early interactions by helping people choose better profile pictures or stopping them from sending rude messages.</p>

  <p id="JPpnZs">Slack is many things. Which is kind of the problem. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22587666/slack-acquisition-salesforce-closed-messaging-cloud">Salesforce-owned</a> company has spent years building a team chat app alongside an alerts system, a file storage system, a knowledge base, and all the other things encompassed by Slack’s “digital HQ” motto. Over time, though, Slack ran out of space, and too many of those features became either cluttered, buried, or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23411393/slack-channels-organize-how-to">both</a>. Eventually, that even affects the “talk to your team” part of Slack, which itself can be harder to manage when you’re in lots of workspaces, channels, and group chats.</p>
<p id="9U5oA5">So Slack is changing. It’s about to roll out its biggest-ever redesign, changing both the look and the layout of the app to hopefully make things easier to find and easier to manage. It’s designed...</p>

  <p id="W142f1">If you’re wondering how many times Samsung’s latest foldable flip phone, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23820202/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review-screen-battery-camera-hinge">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>, might survive when subjected to the stresses and strains of the real world, YouTuber Mrkeybrd has an answer for you: 401,146. Between August 2nd and today, his channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/6lY7SuSR7tA?feature=share">has run a livestream</a> of the phone being continuously folded and unfolded by a series of testers. Initially, Samsung’s foldable was being compared to Motorola’s recently released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23768630/motorola-razr-plus-40-ultra-review-screen-battery-camera">Razr Plus</a> (known as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/1/23744843/motorola-razr-plus-2023-screen-price-cameras#:~:text=You%20might%20have%20seen%20the%20specs%20already%2C%20but%20just%20to%20recap%3A%20the%20Razr%20Plus%20(the%20Razr%2040%20Ultra%20internationally)">Razr 40 Ultra outside of the US</a>), but the screen on Motorola’s foldable died after just 126,266 cycles.</p>
<p id="rXHNTd">Mrkeybrd’s test is hardly as scientific as the kinds of robotic automated folding and unfolding Samsung has shown off in its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_CI3x7AIaQ">promotional materials for the Flip 5 and Fold 5</a>, but <a href="https://www.thegreatfoldingtest2.com/">t...</a></p>

  <p id="LWqQcW">For years, Tesla was synonymous with everything cool, high tech, and futuristic. But is it still today?</p>
<p id="IvDTUq">“Teslas used to look cool and now they don’t,” said Jessica Resler, a Brooklyn resident recently shopping for an EV who eventually settled on a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23151623/bmw-i4-review-electric-specs-price">BMW i4</a>. “And they’ve become the Uber car of the city.”</p>
<p id="2eQzHE">In case it wasn’t clear, no one wants to be known as “the Uber car of the city.” Previous designees include various Toyotas — Prius, RAV4, etc. — a brand that’s more synonymous with terms like “functional” and “within my budget” than “cool.” </p>

<p id="hxaSSQ">But maybe it’s a good thing, a sign of forward progress, that Tesla is shedding its cool persona and becoming more of a car for the masses. After all, the goal is to get more people into EVs, not...</p>
