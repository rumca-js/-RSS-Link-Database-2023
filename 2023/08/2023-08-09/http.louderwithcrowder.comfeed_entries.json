He had a few months off for paternity leave, but he's back and is being welcomed by Joe Biden. With an old man meltdown over Doocy having the stones to do his job as a journalist. Doocy walked up to Biden and asked him a question. He just... walked up to him and asked. RUDE!</p><p>Of course, it was a question about Hunter Biden's shady business dealings and how Joe would ALLEGEDLY call into his second favorite son's meetings with foreign business partners. <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jen-psaki-hunter-biden-reporter\" target=\"_blank\">The White House has rules against such nonsense</a>.</p><p>DOOCY:  Your son's former business associate is claiming that you were on speakerphone a lot with them talking business. </p><p>BIDEN: I never talked business with anybody!

Weird, right?</p><p>This part of Devon's testimony about the Ukrainian energy company that paid Hunter a ludicrous amount of money for a job he had no experience in was of particular interest.</p><blockquote>While they were sitting outside at the bar, Vadym Pozharskyi, a senior Burisma executive, phoned to ask where they were because Burisma\u2019s owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, needed to speak to Hunter urgently. Soon afterward, the two Ukrainians joined Hunter and Archer at the Four Seasons bar and Pozharskyi asked Hunter: \u201cCan you ring your dad?\u201d</blockquote><p>Atcher's testimony came on the heels of a confidential FBI source stepping forward to say <a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2023/07/20/joe-biden-hunter-both-told-ukrainian-oligarch-burisma-board/\" target=\"_blank\">Joe and Hunter BOTH told the CEO of Burisma to retain the president\u2019s son</a>.</p><p>...which came on the heels of confirmation <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/jul/20/fbi-told-twitter-hunter-biden-laptop-was-real-soon/\" target=\"_blank\">the FBI knew that Hunter's laptop was real the entire time</a>.</p><p>...which came on the heels of a whistleblower testifying before Congress that, as someone who worked on the Hunter Biden tax investigation, there were a lot of people in Joe Biden's government <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/whistleblower-x-testimony\" target=\"_self\">who didn't want anyone working on the Hunter Biden tax investigation</a>.</p><p>Doocy is still getting readjusted to being back at work.

It really hit people where they hurt. You\u2019ve got interest rates up. It\u2019s just a lot.</blockquote><p>See, that's the point elitists like <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2023/08/04/joy_behar_the_economy_is_booming_inflation_is_down_people_are_having_an_easier_time_putting_bread_on_the_table.html\" target=\"_blank\">Joy Behar don't get</a> and elitists like <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/anti-trump-nyt-writer-shocks-column-bashing-elite-self-dealing-jerks-were-the-bad-guys\" target=\"_blank\">David Brooks almost get, but not quite</a>. It's easy to rely on statistics to justify your candidate when you have so much money you don't feel any pain yourself. Clueless Behar can claim Americans are having an easy time \"putting bread on the table\" because she doesn't know where everything from her panty came from or how it got there.</p><p>To other people, while inflation may have \"come down\" it's still higher than it was. Low employment rates don't matter when you struggle to support your family with the job -- or jobs -- you do have. And Biden's agenda (that he still on occasion blames Russia for) is the key reason why things are so unaffordable.</p><p>The only statistic that matters to voters is what I call the \"everyone I know\" metric. Assign a number to yourself based on your job status and how expensive you find everything (food, gas, utilities, etc.). Plus one for everyone you know who is doing okay. Minus one for everyone you know who is not. That's the only number that matters to people when they vote, and it is how they judge the people they vote for.</p><p>For elitists who work in the media, everyone they know is doing fine. They also didn't struggle to make ends meet during the pandemic either.</p><p>For Normie-Americans, that is not the case, no matter what monthly statistics Joe Biden's government comes up with. Hence why people who work for CNN (<a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mika-attacks-joe-biden-staff\" target=\"_blank\">or MSNBC</a>) not understanding why so many Americans don't slurp Biden as much as they do.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

Wrong Mike Pence fail. The new fail is his latest ad that looks like it was pitched and crafted by people <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/anheuser-busch-layoffs\" target=\"_blank\">who no longer have a job working for Bud Light</a>. Either that or his new co-campaign managers are Matt Stone and Trey Parker from <em>South Park</em>. And they bought in Seth MacFarlane from <em>Family Guy</em> to run comms. There is no way anyone who likes Mike Pence thinks THIS is a good ad for 2023. I just don't mean 2023's GOP electorate. I mean 2023 as a point in time. </p><p>Folksy Mike Pence driving a pickup truck, filling it up with gas, and pining for the good ol' days when he could afford gasoline. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Mike_Pence/status/1689014062305128448\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I haven't seen such a fail in an ad like this since a North Carolina Democrat tried to pander to BBQ fans in North Carolina... <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bbq-cal-cunningham\" target=\"_blank\">by cooking on a gas grill</a>. Worse, he sullied the name of BBQing political Cunninghams (shout out RedState's Joe Cunningham).</p><p>To believe Mike Pence is filling up his pick-up truck requires you to believe Pence drives or pumps his own glass. He is the former vice president who was a governor before that and a congressman before that. This is the video equivalent of \"a how do you do, fellow midwesterners\" meme.</p><p>Also, as Daily Caller <a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2023/08/08/mike-pence-error-energy-gas-station-video/\" target=\"_blank\">was quick to point out</a>, \"...the gasoline pump can be heard making a beeping noise, which typically prompts the user to select a fuel grade before beginning to fill up. Pence also does not pretend to pull the trigger on the handle, which would start the flow of gasoline if he had selected a type of fuel and paid for gas.\"</p><p>It is every cheesy, corny, conservative, middle-America trope they can squeeze into a minute. The only thing missing is an American Flag flying in the background for no reason whatsoever and a Jason Aldean song. It is one thing when <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-chicken-fried-commercial\" target=\"_blank\">a company like Bud Light thinks so little of its audience</a> they think THIS appeals to anyone. You should expect more from actual conserva... ok, I think I see my error there. The people working on Pence's campaign need to be blacklisted.</p><p>Adding to the fail, I guess Pence is using this video to announce his energy plan. Everyone has been too busy taking the piss out of it. Also, any GOP candidate's energy plan needs to include only one point.</p><p>1. Do the exact opposite that Joe Biden has done.</p><p>This is the point on the primary where I start to get stabby because you have people who have a role to play and then you have interlopers. Ron DeSantis has his role, as does the former president. Like them or not, Chris Christie, Tim Scott, and Nikki Haley all have their \"one early state can change it all\" roles. It's Joseph Campbell's \"A Candidate of 1000 Faces.\" We see the same storylines play out every four years.</p><p>Mike Pence plays no role other than to be the guy who doesn't realize it's not 2009 anymore. I don't even think he takes votes away from the other candidates. He's there just because he's Mike Pence and has nothing else to do.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.
