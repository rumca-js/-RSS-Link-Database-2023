<p><strong>Summerhall, Edinburgh<br /></strong>The comic relives being a carer for a lovably eccentric adopted uncle in a heartfelt show that demonstrates caring’s reciprocal flow</p><p>The “dead dad show” is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/dec/02/dead-funny-comedy-grief-standups-death-humour-laughter">a fringe comedy staple</a>. But what about the dead not-quite-an-uncle show? Ben Target is a comedian who, by his own account, never quite delivered on the promise identified by his best fringe newcomer nomination more than a decade ago. Well, he delivers something very lovely here, with an autobiographical hour about the time he spent as end-of-life carer for his adopted uncle, a maverick live-in colleague of his grandparents and “the only adult with whom [Target] ever felt safe”.</p><p>The show flits between timelines to recount Target’s relationship with Lorenzo, a fugitive from a rackety Hong Kong upbringing, later expelled from Cuba by Fidel Castro himself – for being too cheeky, some say, or for being a spy. In a childhood not overflowing with affection, Lorenzo was Target’s refuge, a surrogate dad who preferred silly to serious and freedom to convention. Fifteen years on, Target finds himself sole carer to his former mentor: bathing him, giving him morphine and cleaning up his mess – before watching his own life swirl down the plughole with all the Dettol, blood and poo.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/09/ben-target-lorenzo-review-summerhall-edinburgh">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The election of the Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has changed the environmental politics of the region.

That narrowest of victories may have been the single most important environmental development of 2022. With Mr Bolsonaro in power, the Amazon rainforest was hurtling towards a tipping point after which it would no longer function as a climate stabiliser and the world’s biggest carbon sink. Between August 2021 and July 2022, an area of forest the size of Qatar was <a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2022/12/despite-11-drop-in-2022-amazon-deforestation-rate-has-soared-under-bolsonaro/" title="">cleared</a> in the interests of big business.</p><p>Lula’s government has stopped the rot. Companies involved in illegal deforestation have been sanctioned, armed interventions have taken place to end illegal mining operations, and new conservation areas have been established. Deforestation dropped by 42% during Lula’s first seven months in office, and the state has returned as a protective presence in the Brazilian Amazon. The transformed political context was the catalyst for this week’s landmark regional summit in Belém, in which the eight Latin American nations sharing the Amazon came together – for the first time in 14 years – to produce a plan for its sustainable development.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/09/the-guardian-view-on-the-amazon-summit-rich-nations-must-now-step-up">Continue reading...</a>

The past 22 majors have produced 21 different champions – only Minjee Lee, at the 2021 Evian Championship and 2022 US Open, has doubled up during that time – and of those 21 players, 17 were first-time major winners. Godspeed your pin as you stick it into the tee sheet before the Women’s Open at Walton Heath.</p><p>Céline Boutier, who won her first major at the Evian 11 days ago, followed it up last weekend with victory at the Scottish Open. She’s in the form of her life, her long game solid, her approaches dialled in, her flat stick rolling true. She’s the hottest ticket in town – yet the 29-year-old Parisian, aiming to become the first woman to win back-to-back majors since Inbee Park captured the Dinah Shore, PGA and US Open in short order in 2013, isn’t particularly willing to talk up her chances of winning this week’s record $1.35m (£1.06m) winner’s purse.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/09/i-know-the-odds-celine-boutier-plays-down-chances-at-womens-open">Continue reading...</a>

## Perverse as it sounds, Donald Trump in a prison cell may be the worst possible outcome | Emma Brockes

<p>Imagine Trump posing as the ultimate martyr, campaigning for president from jail – his supporters would find it irresistible</p><p>It seems a long time ago, but there was a brief period, after Joe Biden’s inauguration and before the 6 January hearings and the start of campaigning for next year’s presidential election, when it was possible to avoid Donald Trump for days at a time. He was still there, obviously, wandering the corridors at Mar-a-Lago, Gloria Swanson-style, and posting screeds to <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/109449803240069864">Truth Social</a>. But there was no real reason to think about him and, for that short period, he was returned to his essential state: just another person posting unhinged rants online.</p><p>This is not where Trump is now – in the US, at least. Thanks to a raft of legal actions, culminating earlier this month in the justice department’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/03/donald-trump-arraignment-key-takeaways">arraignment</a> of the former president for allegedly trying to overturn the 2020 election result, Trump is not only front and centre every day, but in danger of ascending to a new position in the news cycle: political martyr and victim of a witch-hunt. Given the preposterousness of the events leading up to this moment – only recently, a jury found Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/09/e-jean-carroll-wins-trump-trial-verdict">liable</a> for defamation and sexual abuse – it seems inevitable we should find ourselves here.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/09/donald-trump-prison-cell-campaign-for-us-president">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From a defensive stalwart to a golden boot contender, these are the players who pose the greatest threats to Matildas’ dreams in Saturday’s quarter-final</p><p>The Matildas’ 1-0 friendly victory over France last month represented a promising precursor to the hosts’ World Cup ambitions. But since Mary Fowler slipped home that second-half winner in Melbourne, the home side have been on a journey. Sam Kerr’s injury saga, Australia’s dour early victory over Ireland, defensive frailties against Nigeria. Then the Matildas’ revival, the emphatic victory over Canada and professional triumph over Denmark. Now a quarter-final against France in Brisbane.</p><p>And in finding the way to the summit, sometimes you need to retrace your steps. Not unlike the Matildas, the French started the tournament slowly. A 0-0 draw against Jamaica before a narrow 2-1 victory over Brazil. But since then, the class of the world No 5-ranked side has been on full display. A 6-3 thumping of Panama – without rested veterans Wendie Renard and Eugénie Le Sommer – then a 4-0 trouncing of Morocco in the round of 16 has highlighted the prowess of the French team and these individuals.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/10/womens-world-cup-2023-france-vs-australia-squad-best-players-wendie-renard-kadidiatou-diani-vicki-becho-eugenie-le-sommer">Continue reading...</a>

Here, he explains how he wrote new thriller The Woman in the Wall, starring Ruth Wilson</p><p>At a wedding, a priest sings The Well Below the Valley, an old Irish ballad about an abused woman accused of infanticide. The camera pans around the room, lands on women of all ages listening with an unspoken understanding. Moments later, a young woman is lured away and raped by her cousin. But this is not the only crime. Not the one that will merit punishment, at least. That comes immediately after, when the young woman, Margaret, played by Anne-Marie Duff, tells her friend what has happened. Margaret then watches in horror as the news slowly spreads around the room of wedding guests in unheard whispers. The men all begin to glare at her. Not at her attacker – at <em>her</em>. The next day, Margaret is sent away to a Magdalene Laundry.</p><p>This is the opening to Peter Mullan’s brilliant and appropriately harrowing 2002 film, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/feb/21/artsfeatures1">The Magdalene Sisters</a>, and it would serve as my introduction to the Magdalene Laundries.

## ‘People would have lost their culture’: the Birmingham record label that saved south Asian music

<p>From a transistor radio shop, Oriental Star Agencies championed legends such as Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and nurtured bhangra to chart success. Its 84-year-old founder recalls how</p><p>When Muhammad Ayyub moved to Birmingham from Pakistan in 1961, he immediately felt homesick. Back in Gujrat, he had enjoyed a “pleasant and social life”, collecting records, watching films and going to festivals alongside his teaching job. But here, in the early years of south Asian migration to the West Midlands, there was little he could engage with – he and his small community only had each other’s homes to gather in and reminisce. “Now we have TV channels, concerts and musicians visiting from India and Pakistan, but at that time it was different,” he says. “We missed our music, we missed our culture.”</p><p>Fed up with low-paid, unstable work, Ayyub opened a shop selling transistor radios on Balsall Heath Road in 1966. Around the same time, the cinema next door had introduced Sunday matinee screenings for south Asian films and people would gather in his shop afterwards, discussing the scores and expressing longing for the sounds they had grown up with. Prompted by their requests, Ayyub began importing records from India and Pakistan. The initial order, which took more than six weeks to arrive by ship, went like hotcakes, he recalls, smiling.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/09/people-would-have-lost-their-culture-the-birmingham-record-label-that-saved-south-asian-music">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Zoo Southside, Edinburgh<br /></strong>Polish company Song of the Goat strip Titus Andronicus back to tell a brutal tale of postwar violence, betrayal and revenge</p><p>If you are going to tell Shakespeare’s tale of tongue slashing and hand chopping, there is no point being mealy mouthed about it. Wrocław’s <a href="http://piesnkozla.pl/en">Song of the Goat</a> company does not disoblige with their version of Titus Andronicus. Andronicus Synecdoche gives a gruesome story the full gothic opera treatment, all monochrome intensity, relentless rhythms and austere, militaristic choreography. Even at the curtain call, the large Polish company finds it hard to smile.</p><p>This is the company, set up by Anna Zubrzycki and Grzegorz Bral, that made its name on the Edinburgh fringe nearly 20 years ago with polyphonic pieces sung in an invented ur-language that was as haunting as it was fanciful. Shows such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2004/aug/13/theatre.edinburghfestival20042">Chronicles: A Lamentation</a> had a mesmerising, religious intensity, the more so because of the physical commitment of the large ensemble.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/09/andronicus-synecdoche-review-zoo-southside-edinburgh">Continue reading...</a>

## So long ‘immersive Van Gogh’: we deserve better than this cynical and elitist approach to art | Rachel Connolly

<p>We never needed gizmos and expensive tickets to enjoy great art. If  Disney’s Lighthouse Immersive is ailing, that’s no bad thing</p><p>Repetition and familiarity are everywhere in our culture. From the commercial novels advertised entirely in terms of their similarity to popular titles from the previous year or two, to endless and proliferating film franchises, the selling point of so many things now is, in effect: this is a slightly (even very) worse version of something you’ve seen already. The “immersive art” concept offered by companies like Disney’s Lighthouse Immersive is the purest form of this wearying trend, so recent news that Lighthouse has <a href="https://www.dallasobserver.com/arts/lighthouse-immersive-which-brought-its-van-gogh-show-to-dallas-is-bankrupt-17208878">filed for bankruptcy</a> feels like a faintly promising development.</p><p>Lighthouse Immersive puts on shows in which reproductions of work by household-name artists are blown up and projected on to the walls of galleries. Music is piped into the space to curate the mood, taking the place that imagination plays in a traditional exhibition. The idea is that these magnified projections encourage an audience to appreciate the finer details of certain famous paintings.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/09/immersive-van-gogh-art-disney-lighthouse">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Thomas Laurance’s documentary focuses on the British activists who arrived in the refugee camp with housing materials and other life-saving supplies</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/02/life-death-and-limbo-in-the-calais-jungle-five-years-after-its-demolition">Before its demolition in 2016</a>, the Calais Jungle – as it was known by its residents – was home to thousands of refugees and migrants who were hoping to either claim asylum in France or to obtain a passage to the UK. Originally consisting of makeshift tents and lacking basic amenities such as heat and water, the precarious encampment was made more tolerable by the efforts of grassroots activists. Emphasising the lived realities beneath this notorious symbol of the refugee crisis in Europe, Thomas Laurance’s extraordinary documentary observes the cultural vibrancy and solidarity that blossomed on the muddy ground.</p><p>While there are glimpses of well-known faces, including actor Juliet Stevenson, the focus here is on ordinary British people who were spurred to action by a shared sense of responsibility. At a time when NGO operations were hampered by red tape, volunteers arrived in Calais with housing materials and other life-saving supplies. They helped the residents to erect more secure housing units, as well as shops, restaurants and even a theatre space. The facilities were rudimentary, yet this work created an environment of normality and community for those whose fundamental rights were being denied by state institutions.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/09/on-our-doorstep-review-extraordinary-story-of-volunteers-in-the-calais-jungle">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Monkey Barrel at the Tron, Edinburgh<br /></strong>This part-improvised, largely mimed and entirely chaotic comic play about guinea pigs and bank robbery is ramshackle fun</p><p>Edinburgh comedy award-nominated <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/aug/25/elf-lyons-review-swan-lake-edinburgh">in 2017</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/oct/04/elf-lyons-funniest-things">Elf Lyons</a> can’t be accused of treading the conventional career path since. None of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/nov/02/elf-lyons-raven-review-soho-theatre-london">her shows</a> ever remotely resembles the next. Created with the deaf artist Duffy, Heist is a part-improvised, largely mimed and entirely chaotic comic play about – well, what is it about, exactly? Guinea pigs. Bank robbery. An “evil alien nonce”. I spent a fair portion of the show wondering what and why, until Lyons pipes up with “none of this show makes sense. It’s just made out of my favourite signs from Level One [BSL]!”</p><p>Aha. That explains the eccentric content. As for the precarious form of a show that doesn’t seem to know whether it’s scripted or improvised – well, that’s all part of the ramshackle fun, as Elf berates Duffy between (and during) scenes about his lax narrative discipline. No point pretending the story is clear, or that it adds up to much more than randomly generated nonsense. But it doesn’t lack jeopardy. With car chases, abseils down tower blocks and severed testicles, Heist might be Elf and Duffy, but it’s definitely not ’elf and safety.</p><p>At <a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/elf-and-duffy-heist">Monkey Barrel at the Tron, Edinburgh</a>, until 15 August</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/edinburgh-festival-2023+tone/reviews">All our Edinburgh festival reviews</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/09/elf-and-duffy-heist-review-comedy-monkey-barrel-at-the-tron-edinburgh">Continue reading...</a>

So let’s do that. Just like the fantastical city it is named after, Baldur’s Gate 3 is a soaring success. It’s everything you’ve ever loved about any roleplaying game, with +1 to all stats.</p><p>Like its predecessors, Baldur’s Gate 3 takes place in Dungeons and Dragons’ Forgotten Realms setting. Unlike those earlier titles – nascent offerings from the Mass Effect and Dragon Age studio, BioWare – this adventure from Belgian studio Larian, uses the fifth edition D&amp;D ruleset. A few homebrew tweaks aside, it’s as faithful a rendition as you’ll find in the digital space, though no worries if you don’t know your Armor Class from your Proficiencies - the game will take care of all that pesky maths for you.

One of those ideas was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/06/oceangate-suspends-operations-titan-submersible">OceanGate</a>: the company that used to send people to the bottom of the sea in submersibles until one of those submersibles imploded, killing all five people on board, including Söhnlein’s co-founder.

He lays out all his plans in an extremely unimpressive website for his foundation called <a href="https://www.humans2venus.org/">Humans2Venus</a>.</p><p>While all this may sound completely ridiculous, don’t worry: Söhnlein has looked into the logistics and concluded that getting to Venus is “very doable”. “I think it is less aspirational than putting 1 million people on the Martian surface by 2050,” he mused. You should trust him on this – he’s been researching the matter for a very long time. “I think I’ve been driven to help make humanity a multiplanet species since I was 11 years old,” he told Insider. “I had this recurring dream of being the commander of the first Martian colony.” I’ve had a recurring dream that I forgot to do any of my maths homework for a year and then I had to sit a test, but I haven’t spun that into a business venture.</p><p>Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/09/looking-for-your-next-adventure-why-not-move-to-venus">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Gentrification is a recurring theme in the Brooklyn writer’s second short-story collection</p><p>Jamel Brinkley’s 2019 debut short story collection, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/07/a-lucky-man-jamel-brinkley-review">A Lucky Man</a>, announced an important new voice in anglophone fiction, a technically skilled storyteller with a particular talent for depicting the obscure nuances of interpersonal relationships. Recriminations, resentments and regrets are the order of the day in the 10 distinctly downbeat tales comprising his new collection, Witness. The narrator of one story, Arrows, sets the tone when he muses that the world is made up of two sorts of people: those who are able to recover from traumas, and those who “tend to become ghosts”. “Stuck on something that happened to them, or on an obsession, they’re the ones who can’t accept people’s inevitably forward movement through the entanglements of time.” Many of the characters here belong firmly in the latter category.</p><p>In The Let-Out, a young man is befriended by an older woman who had once been romantically involved with his estranged father. He is plunged into doleful reminiscence: “What I remember most from those years aren’t images or events, but sensations, feelings of anger, aggression, and obstinacy … ” Comfort tells of a Black woman stuck in an alcoholic, grief-stricken rut, four years on from her brother’s death at the hands of a white police officer. She has become obsessed with the officer’s family, stalking them online. The narrator of Sahar embarks on a bizarre one-way correspondence with a driver from a fast food delivery app, writing her a series of increasingly lengthy notes in which she offloads about her late husband while also ruminating on gentrification and the precariousness of gig economy work. She signs off one missive: “I hope you won’t think I’m loony tunes.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/09/witness-by-jamel-brinkley-review-downbeat-tales-of-new-york">Continue reading...</a>

The grumbles of discontent have rumbled since Lopetegui suggested the goalposts had moved, claiming he learned the severity of Wolves’ financial constraints only at the end of last season. The noncommittals then were telling.

We’re on the Buna (Bunë) River, a 40km stretch of water which divides the countries and is so tranquil that every sound is amplified, from the dip of our paddles to the rousing tones of the Muslim call to prayer.</p><p>I’m on a six-day kayaking adventure, following a 70km route that crisscrosses the border. Starting in Lake Skadar (Liqeni i Shkodrës), which spans both countries and is the largest lake on the Balkan peninsula, at about 400sq km, our aquatic odyssey traces the Montenegrin side of the lake, crosses to its Albanian shores and then follows the Buna all the way to the Adriatic. With a mix of wild camping, homestays and waterfront cabins, it’s the kick out of my urban cocoon that I have long craved.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/aug/09/cross-border-kayaking-balkans-montenegro-albania">Continue reading...</a>

## Jadie David: the legendary Black stuntwoman on 30ft falls, motorcycle jumps and being set on fire

<p>She doubled for Pam Grier on Foxy Brown, dodged moving cars in The Blues Brothers and once spent an entire year in a body cast. All while fighting for the rights of other stunt performers</p><p>Jadie David’s entry into the movie business sounds like a scene from a film. It was 1971; she was 22 years old, living in Burbank, Los Angeles. She would regularly ride her horse in nearby Griffith Park. She knew most of the other riders out there, including an African American man named Bob Minor. “Bob used to ride up next to me and go: ‘Hi, how you doing?’” says David. “But I was like, ‘This guy’s flirting with me.’ I really didn’t pay much attention to him.” Minor told her he was in the movie industry and that he liked her look, and asked for her phone number. “So, I’m like, ‘This is Hollywood. Who knows what could happen?’”</p><p>Two weeks later, Minor called her. “He said: ‘I have this movie for you to do,’” David says. “‘We’re going to fly you to Arizona first class, we’re going to put you in a first-class hotel, you’re going to make ...’ I forget what it was, but it was a lot of money back then.” Minor was a stunt performer. He was going to Arizona to work on a western, doubling for the actor Fred Williamson; they also needed a double for his co-star, Denise Nicholas, for scenes involving horse riding and “water work” – swimming and diving in rivers. David was tall, like Nicholas. At the time, she was studying to become a nurse; by comparison, this sounded like a holiday.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/09/jadie-david-the-legendary-black-stuntwoman-on-30ft-falls-motorcycle-jumps-and-being-set-on-fire">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Young women struggling with debt and burnout need a better vision than getting a rich man to pay the bills</p><p>A month ago, I decided to wrap up work early and have a little treat. I took myself out to a hotel bar and sat alone reading in the sun, while people socialised in twos and threes around me. Someone bought me a drink, and a little while later, a woman leaned over to me on her way out and said: “Sprinkle sprinkle.”</p><p>She was quoting the catchphrase of the YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SheRaSeven1/videos">SheraSeven</a>, the viral sensation and self-styled “financial adviser” whose advice I had inadvertently followed.

<p>The party says its aim is to speed up the prosecution process because the time taken to charge suspects is getting longer</p><p>Good morning. In August, as “normal” political news dries up, journalists are more dependent than usual on what the political parties are offering and the government is still banging away with announcements designed to show that it is deal with the small boats problem. <strong>Robert Jenrick</strong>, the immigration minister, has been promoting a deal with Turkey intended to tackle illegal migration. The Home Office statement is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-turkey-joint-statement-on-illegal-migration/uk-turkey-joint-statement-on-illegal-migration">here</a>, and our story about the initiative is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/09/uk-government-announces-deal-with-turkey-to-disrupt-people-smuggling-gangs">here</a>.</p><p>But today Labour has got its own, rival announcement. It is about crime, and how to ensure more crimes lead to suspects being charged, and it is inspired in particular by this chart in <a href="https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mission-Safety.pdf">the document</a> Keir Starmer published earlier this year explaining his “making Britain’s streets safe” mission.

<p>The chair of the standards committee tackles bullying, corruption and constitutional reform</p><p>It must be a while ago now since Chris Bryant has had to write a sermon. But the former curate turned Labour MP, middle-ranking minister and latterly chair of the parliamentary committee that helps determine the fate of MPs who have sinned, doesn’t seem to have lost the knack. His account of what is rotten in the state of politics is neither lofty – if anything Bryant goes out of his way to confess to what he sees as his own failings, including a tendency to be “impulsive, sanctimonious and pompous” – nor overmoralising, but remains gently steadfast in the belief that parliament in general and this one in particular has lost its way. Code of Conduct is an attempt to guide it back to something like the straight and narrow.</p><p>He is, of course, entering a crowded literary field. Almost half the publishing industry seems to have had a shot now at detailing how the Boris Johnson era descended into such squalor; the lies, the chaos, the unedifying scrabble around for someone else to pay for his interior designers, and the willingness to overlook all manner of dubious behaviour in his ministers and aides. Even more ink has been spilt on the way Brexit has twisted politics out of shape, with its litany of false promises setting up leave voters for inevitable disillusionment. The queasy charade that is the modern honours system or the culture of abuse and threats that puts good people off standing for parliament are equally well-worn subjects, and in that sense Bryant is comparatively late to the party. But he brings with him more than two decades’ experience as a parliamentarian, a nonpartisan approach that helps him look beyond the failings of individuals to the system itself, and a raft of often small but practical suggestions for cleaning out the stables.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/09/code-of-conduct-by-chris-bryant-review-a-manifesto-for-a-better-politics">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Creative director Hannah Nicklin explains how the narrative adventure game offers a far-reaching new take on storytelling</p><p>What does it mean to play a video game as an ensemble rather than a single character? How would it change your experience of people and plot? What if there was no single hero, or perhaps no heroes at all? As Hannah Nicklin, a creative director at independent studio Die Gute Fabrik explains, these are questions that narrative adventure <a href="https://www.saltseachronicles.com/">Saltsea Chronicles</a> is attempting to answer, all while telling its own charming story of misfit sailors voyaging across a flooded archipelago to uncover a conspiracy.</p><p>It’s a lofty pitch, and one Nicklin brings back down to earth with a comparison: “Star Trek: The Next Generation without the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_destiny">manifest destiny</a>” – a description that hints at the game’s politics and its structure. “We take that ensemble cast, and we put you in the centre of a mystery that you are trying to uncover,” she says. “You’re on the ship and often get to choose which islands to visit. You choose who forms the expedition party and what they say when they get there.” All this plays out across gorgeously rendered environments, like a classic LucasArts adventure game of the 1990s with the visual the flair of a European arthouse cartoon. Logic puzzles make way for an emphasis on character, world-building, and exploration – the simple pleasures of getting to know a people and place.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/aug/09/star-trek-without-the-manifest-destiny-saltsea-chronicles-a-gently-radical-vision-of-the-future">Continue reading...</a>

This is because of a test that was introduced in 2014, snuck into the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/12/section/175/enacted?view=plain">Criminal Justice Act</a>. <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/12/section/175/enacted?view=plain">Section 133 (1ZA)</a> declares that compensation is only available if the new or newly discovered fact that led to the conviction being quashed shows “beyond reasonable doubt” that the person did not commit the offence.

## Lady Dealer review – drugs, couplets and a blaze of Beastie Boys

<p><strong>Roundabout @ Summerhall, Edinburgh<br /></strong>Alexa Davies’ performance as Charly, a rhyming drug dealer who is falling apart, is the gleaming heart of this production</p><p>‘I am a trailblazer,” declares Charly – “a female drug dealer.” Phones at her hips, gunslinger style, she cranks up the Beastie Boys and prepares to boss the day from her south London flat.<br /><br />In Martha Watson Allpress’s new play, Charly speaks in couplets, though promises to stop “if the rhyming thing gets boring / If I begin to hear hints of snoring.” No danger of that: Alexa Davies’ glinting performance opens in a cascade of energy, and buoyant rhymes seem just right for gobby Charly, who is chipper, self-aware, with a gleam in her eye. This work comes easily to her – “you just need gravitas and a positive attitude” – and she makes it sound ethical-ish: “I am the Santa Claus of dealing, fam.” The chiming text reassures us that everything is in place (“pun intended / I am mended”).</p><p>She hopes for a dealer’s groundhog day – wake, sell, repeat – to dull the sting of her breakup with a “trust fund darling”. Yet the rhapsodic swim of rolling sound and coloured lights in Emily Aboud’s production keep cutting out, plunging back into greyscale. We learn that Charly is unshowered, flanked by crusty laundry and has just stepped in last-night’s pizza. It’s not exactly a picture of girlboss success.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/09/lady-dealer-review-roundabout-summerhall-edinburgh-martha-watson-allpress-alexa-davies">Continue reading...</a>

## Cheri by Jo Ann Beard review – an author too good to miss

<p>The US essayist is a rare talent. In this slim volume she imagines a woman’s dying days with shocking clarity</p><p>About 10 years ago, I stopped reading an essay by the American author Jo Ann Beard because it was too good. It was about a man called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/16/books/review/festival-days-by-jo-ann-beard-an-excerpt.html" title="">Werner </a>who woke to the sound of screaming one night and, after some delay, realised his apartment building was on fire. He was on the fifth floor. The way Beard described shock distorting his sense of time was so vivid I found it hard to breathe in the bookshop where I stood. I had no idea if Werner survived in real life, was disfigured or even died – it was possible Beard was entering the thoughts of a man in his last moments, or imagining them for us, and this seemed so unbearable I put the book down and walked away from one of the best writers at work today. (Werner survived; he dived head-first through the window of an apartment opposite and landed on a stranger’s bed. So phew.)</p><p>You can find Beard’s most famous essay, The Fourth State of Matter, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1996/06/24/the-fourth-state-of-matter" title="">online at the New Yorker</a>. This memoir seems to be about Beard’s dog problem and also her divorce problem when she was working in an American university office. About halfway through, the details become so exhaustive, so saturated with a sense of imminence, that I couldn’t take it any longer and clicked away to find out what happened next. Warning: you will spoil your reading of Jo Ann Beard if you break the circumference of her prose. The essay relates facts so random and extreme it makes you query the process of reading itself. It also displays Beard’s talent for the incidental: the dying dog and the absent husband are not the main subjects here, but this small death and ordinary absence are given the proper weight of our regard.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/09/cheri-by-jo-ann-beard-review-an-author-too-good-to-miss">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This charming animated series – adapted from the popular web comic – has the potential to be wonderful. Sadly, the 25-minute episodes are full of gimmicky characters and repetitive takes</p><p>You know books? The chunky rectangular things, made out of paper? And you know how they increasingly seem to be the perfect form for their function? People tried to replace them with e-readers but humanity collectively said “We’ll use them in certain circs, sure. But overall we’ll be sticking with the rectangular paper chunks because they never run out of battery, you can lend them to folk, you can drop them in the bath and they survive, and remember your page better – even if you haven’t used a bookmark – because the whole topography of the thing just makes it easier somehow.” So the e-reader market stalled long before it had reached the saturation point everyone madly investing in the project thought it would.</p><p>There are, in other words, still times in this crazy, technologically madcap world of ours when the ideal mode of conveyance for an idea or an art form is hit on quite early and need not be fussed about with after that. This struck me with increasing force the longer I watched Nathan W Pyle and Dan Harmon’s new animated series, Strange Planet.</p><p>Strange Planet is on Apple TV+</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/aug/09/strange-planet-review-never-has-the-phrase-too-much-of-a-good-thing-been-more-appropriate">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Five months on, I still can’t get the cash to pay her nursery fees</p><p><strong>In February, the government’s tax-free childcare account system had an issue which meant payments into some accounts were duplicated. In my case, a payment of £779 into my daughter’s account was credited five times. The affected accounts were frozen while the extra payments were reclaimed. Five months on, my daughter’s account remains frozen, and I am unable to get the funds to pay her nursery bills. I also can’t make any new payments into the account in order to benefit from the tax-free allowance. Each time I phone, I’m told they can give no indication of when this will be resolved. <br /></strong><em><strong>MM, Newbury</strong></em></p><p>Tax-free childcare is a government scheme to subsidise the cost of childcare. For every £8 paid in by a parent, a £2 top-up is provided by the state. More than 8,000 families were locked out of their accounts in February when their deposits were erroneously multiplied by the banking provider used by NS&amp;I, which administers the scheme, and they were collectively paid £18.6m in top-ups instead of the £3.1m due. Some nearly lost their nursery places when they were unable to pay the fees.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/aug/09/hmrc-froze-my-daughters-tax-free-childcare-account">Continue reading...</a>

## Enter the Dragon review – Bruce Lee classic still delivers a lethal blow

<p>The martial arts film is quintessential Lee, who is mesmeric in his scenes and sorely missed when not on camera</p><p>‘We need emotional content … not anger!” Bruce Lee’s unique screen presence is even more arresting in non-fight mode in this martial arts classic, now re-released for its 50th anniversary. The quote above comes from a scene in which Lee schools a quivering young teen novitiate (Sammo Hung) in kung fu, and his gnomic instructions are delivered with that dreamy-insinuating half-smile that Lee’s face always gravitated towards. While discussing his vocation with a Shaolin master earlier in the movie, Lee says that his technique is “to have no technique” and that approaching an opponent is to “have no opponent”, a Zen transcendence through physical discipline and combat to a purified state in which what he has learned is not needed.</p><p>Lee’s absolute conviction in selling these lines is what earned him his army of fans: no martial arts star does anything like it today. Jackie Chan approximates the ingredient of playfulness, although Lee is never joking – and it’s what still infuriates fans when they think about Lee not being allowed to play the lead in the 70s TV show Kung Fu that wound up starring David Carradine. Lee undoubtedly created the conditions in which Asian American stars could succeed in Hollywood, although recently he has been the subject of a slightly tiresome culture-war contest in which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/30/bruce-lee-daughter-father-portrayal-quentin-tarantino-film-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood">people have taken offence on his behalf</a> about the way he was portrayed in Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/09/enter-the-dragon-review-bruce-lee-classic-still-delivers-a-lethal-blow">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There is no easy answer to the question of how to return one of the world’s best strikers to a cohesive team against France</p><p>“I’m going to be honest,” offered coach Tony Gustavsson on Monday night, after the Matildas’ last-16 victory over Denmark was capped off with the return of captain Sam Kerr. “I could sit here and say it was easy, but it wasn’t. Those decisions are big.”</p><p>The return of Kerr in the final stages of the second half in Sydney was a symbolic moment – the return of their “spiritual leader”following her calf injury on the eve of the tournament. Kerr began to warm up with her team holding a slender one-goal advantage; she was brought on after Hayley Raso had put the game beyond doubt. With the match effectively won, her introduction was in some ways a gamble by Gustavsson.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/aug/09/womens-world-cup-2023-matildas-australia-vs-france-sam-kerr-selection-squad-lineup">Continue reading...</a>
