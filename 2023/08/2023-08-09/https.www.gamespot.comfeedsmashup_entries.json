Becoming an Oathbreaker will give you access to new spells, but these replace your original oath's spells and do not allow you to <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-respec-change-class-guide/1100-6516514/\">respec </a>your character.</p><p>Our build will be staying away from both the Oathbreaker subclass and multiclassing, as we want to keep it as simple as possible.

Sure, helmets like the Master Replicas versions can trace their lineage back to a screen-used version that they were cast from, but Hasbro's helmets look just about as good and are arguably more comfortable to troop around in all day.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-boba-fett-black-series-star-wars-helmet-up-for-preorder-but-youll-want-to-hurry/1100-6516688/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-boba-fett-black-series-star-wars-helmet-up-for-preorder-but-youll-want-to-hurry/1100-6516688/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-08-09T15:01:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Erasing Link From All Timelines | How to Destroy", "description": "<img height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1823/18237460/4175397-destroy_link_v1.jpg\" width=\"480\" /> This week we're targeting Link with three unique strategies to remove him as a threat.

Starting today, Visual Concepts and 2K are unveiling the top 12 players in the game when it launches next month. As always, these are launch-day ratings, so you can reliably expect players to rise and fall from these ranks all season long.</p><p>An interesting difference between Madden and NBA 2K is that, unlike Madden, the NBA 2K series is much pickier about who gets its top ratings. While Madden turns its 99 Club into a small festival of reveals, the NBA 2K series, once again, will launch without even a single 99-rated player.</p><p>So then, who gets top billing? Well, for a hint, think about how the last NBA season played out and you'll be well on your way to figuring it out. Of course, as a fast alternative, you could simply scroll down. Below we've laid out graphics for the game's dozen superstars who enter the game a cut above the hundreds of others around the league. Is your favorite team represented here? Here's another hint: While 12 players have been revealed, only 11 teams are represented. Which team might have two players in the top 12? Give it some thought, then see if you got it right.</p><p>What about your favorite player? Did they make the cut, or will they be fighting to climb the ranks in the season ahead? Check it out below and let us know if you spot any glaring omissions.</p><p>One last note: Though the team is revealing the top 12 players in the game this year, it only sent us graphics for 10 of those players. Missing from the image gallery below are Portland's Damian Lillard (94 OVR) and Los Angeles' Kawhi Leonard (94 OVR). For the other 10, check out their basketball card-like images below.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Devin Booker - 94 OVR</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4176422-nba2k24ratingsrevealbooker.jpg\" /></p><br />     <p><h2>Jimmy Butler - 95 OVR</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4176423-nba2k24ratingsrevealbutler.jpg\" /></p><br />     <p><h2>Jayson Tatum - 95 OVR</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4176431-nba2k24ratingsrevealtatum.jpg\" /></p><br />     <p><h2>Luka Doncic - 95 OVR</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4176430-nba2k24ratingsrevealluka.jpg\" /></p><br />     <p><h2>Stephen Curry - 96 OVR</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4176424-nba2k24ratingsrevealcurry.jpg\" /></p><br />     <p><h2>Kevin Durant - 96 OVR</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4176425-nba2k24ratingsrevealdurant.jpg\" /></p><br />     <p><h2>Joel Embiid - 96 OVR</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4176426-nba2k24ratingsrevealembiid.jpg\" /></p><br />     <p><h2>LeBron James - 96 OVR</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4176429-nba2k24ratingsreveallebron.jpg\" /></p><br />     <p><h2>Giannis Antetokunpo - 96 OVR</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4176427-nba2k24ratingsrevealgiannis.jpg\" /></p><br />     <p><h2>Nikola Joki\u0107 - 98 OVR</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4176428-nba2k24ratingsrevealjokic.jpg\" /></p><br />", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nba-2k24-player-ratings-the-12-best-players-revealed/2900-4831/", "date_published": "2023-08-09T15:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "The Street Fighter 6 TMNT Skins Are Absurdly Expensive", "description": "<p>The Street Fighter 6 and <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/street-fighter-6-and-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-crossover-starts-this-month/1100-6516613/\">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles collaboration </a>has sparked some controversy about the price of its DLC costumes.</p><p>Each of the DLC costumes costs about $15 separately, or <a href=\"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0102-PPSA02632_00-SF600000STANDARD\">750 Fighter Coins</a>.

This combination is an impressive accomplishment, and it's incredible to watch how all those choices can build on one another, culminating in a finale that you helped shape. Together, it makes Stray Gods one of the most memorable gaming experiences I've ever had.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Set within our world--but one in which there's an ounce of truth to the myths surrounding the Greek gods, titans, and their multitude of offspring--Stray Gods starts off like your typical visual novel. Conversations pause in order to present you with a multitude of dialogue options, some of which allow you to gain additional insight into other characters while others push the story forward to the next scene. Almost immediately, you have a chance to flirt with your cute best friend and kickstart one of several different romances. There's comfort in this familiarity.

Like conversations in choice-driven visual novels and RPGs, each song can branch, and the effects of your choices impact not only the direction of that particular song but every performance that succeeds it. Choices are divided into three categories--Kickass, Clever, and Charming--informing both the method by which you're trying to convince someone of something, and how a song can transform. Kickass choices are aggressive and confrontational and make songs take on a more punk rock vibe, while Clever choices are thoughtful and strategic and lean into jazz. Charming choices, on the other hand, are empathetic and caring and create a more melodious tune. Though all of the songs might begin one way, they can drastically change depending on what you choose.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/stray-gods-a-roleplaying-musical-review-worthy-of-an-encore/1900-6418099/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/stray-gods-a-roleplaying-musical-review-worthy-of-an-encore/1900-6418099/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-08-09T14:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "First Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 Trailer Has Arrived, Featuring The Return Of Makarov", "description": "<p>The first trailer for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III has arrived.

I suppose it's possible the lack of backward compatibility could enhance your revenue for a period of time, but at what cost?\"</p><p>Zelnick pointed out that Take-Two doesn't make hardware so it doesn't get to decide, but it's his belief that, \"if you can be compatible technically, then you want to be.\" But in certain circumstances, \"if the leap forward is great enough, that's not a possibility,\" he said.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-executive-says-consoles-without-backwards-compatibility-are-not-ideal/1100-6516690/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-executive-says-consoles-without-backwards-compatibility-are-not-ideal/1100-6516690/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-08-09T13:40:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Pokemon Black And White Remakes May Have Been Teased In Latest Pokemon Presents", "description": "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-presents-august-2023-all-the-big-announcements/1100-6516656/\">August Pokemon Presents</a> livestream had plenty of updates for several mobile and Switch games in the franchise, and according to some fans with a Keen Eye attribute, a potential tease for the next remake of Pokemon Black and White.</p><p>During the final minutes of the presentation that saw new gameplay for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet's Indigo Disk expansion, Drayton of Blueberry Academy's BB League brings out his Archaludon, the evolution of Duralodon.

It's people, like the creepy Governor, the sadistic Negan, or the feral Alpha, who posed the greatest threats to those seeking to rebuild a functional society in the story's post-apocalyptic setting. In <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-walking-dead-betrayal/\">The Walking Dead Betrayal</a>, that theme once more runs deep, only this time it's <em>your </em>turn to ruin lives, claim power, and feed your friends to the undead hordes.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">I recently got to play an early preview of the game ahead of the upcoming PC beta, and I left feeling like I'd only scratched the surface of how different the game can feel round to round, and how wicked its traitors may become.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Walking Dead Betrayal (TWDB) is a social deception and deduction game, which immediately elicits imagery of Among Us, the breakout hit and poster child for the genre.

CEO Strauss Zelnick has dropped a hint that the company will be dropping something major in the 2025 fiscal year, however, which seems likely to be the highly anticipated GTA sequel.</p><p>It's clear from Take Two's forecasting that GTA 6 won't be released within the 2024 fiscal year, which ends on March 31 2024--though it was already unlikely that we would see the game that early. <a href=\"https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/b0694cd8-a90f-4db5-95ff-c859877c668f\">Take Two CEO Strauss Zelnick</a> instead hinted that the 2025 fiscal year, which runs from April 2024 to March 2025, would have a \"a significant inflection point ... which we believe will include new record levels of operating performance.\" It's highly likely that the inflection point refers to Grand Theft Auto 6's release, as one of the most anticipated games currently known to be in production.</p><p>Until then, Take Two's focus appears to be on getting more value out of its existing games, after seeing higher-than-expected profits out of its live service games including Grand Theft Auto Online and NBA 2K23. Its continuing strategy hinges strongly on a live service model, including developing \"season passes and DLC packs\" for key titles, preparing a \"post-launch monetization plan\" for each new title that's released, and even releasing select free-to-play titles for consoles.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-hints-at-late-2024-or-early-2025-release-for-gta-6/1100-6516687/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-hints-at-late-2024-or-early-2025-release-for-gta-6/1100-6516687/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-08-09T06:14:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}]
