In 2021, I remember reporting on the words of senior political leaders. Of course, I knew that people like president Biden and prime minister Johnston were not doctors or scientists. However, I assumed they would be directly advised by the best their respective countries had to offer. Having assumed these leaders were well informed, I often passed on what they had to say. Well, this video is just one example of how they got things wrong, meaning in turn I was wrong. The age of deference has well and truly passed.

Investigation into overreaching, federal COVID-19 vaccination mandates and policies at the,

Department of Defense (DOD), U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Department of Labor (DOL), and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). 

Chairman Wenstrup is requesting access to all documents, communications, and guidance,

utilized by these agencies to craft their coercive policies prior to forcing a novel vaccine — that did not stop the spread or transmission of the virus — on millions of Americans. 

At the Select Subcommittee’s hearing on vaccine mandates last week, expert witnesses highlighted the Biden Administration’s abuse of executive power and disregard for individual freedoms that resulted in employment termination, decreased military readiness, and increased distrust in public health authorities. 

The Select Subcommittee is seeking further information from DOD, OPM, DOL, and HHS regarding any political interference by the Biden White House and other outside organizations on federal COVID-19 vaccine mandates.
