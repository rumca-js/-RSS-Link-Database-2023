Bayes’ Rule is a formula used to update the probability of an event given new evidence. It’s a fundamental concept in probability theory. The formula can be expressed as:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:

 * P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B.
 * P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A.
 * P(A) is the prior probability of event A.
 * P(B) is the total probability of event B.

Some examples of Bayes Rule in real life.
