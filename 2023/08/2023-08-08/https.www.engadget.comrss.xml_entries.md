<p>X is giving advertisers new ways to have some control over what type of content can appear near their ads. The company formerly known as Twitter <a href="https://business.twitter.com/en/blog/a-new-level-of-control-for-x-advertisers.html"><ins>introduced</ins></a> new “sensitivity settings” that allow advertisers to choose between different types of content filtering for their ads.</p><p>The new controls arrive as X is increasingly desperate to win back advertisers. The company’s ad revenue has dropped <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-says-twitters-ad-revenue-has-dropped-by-50-percent-202600398.html"><ins>50 percent</ins></a> since Elon Musk took over as brands cut spending on the platform amid concerns about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-losing-advertisers-boycott-193748977.html">the rise</a> of hate speech and other unsavory content. Since then, watchdog groups have reported several instances of ads from major brands being placed near <a href="https://www.engadget.com/x-placed-ads-from-discovery-showtime-and-usa-today-on-a-neo-nazi-account-202133800.html"><ins>neo-Nazi</ins></a> accounts, <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/twitter/under-elon-musk-twitter-running-corporate-ads-alongside-tweets-holocaust-deniers"><ins>Holocaust deniers</ins></a> and other <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/02/09/twitter-ads-revenue-suspended-account/"><ins>previously suspended</ins></a> users.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With the new tool, X says it “will use machine learning to reduce adjacency to varying levels of content according to a brand’s sensitivity threshold in an upcoming campaign.” For now, the two settings available to advertisers include “conservative” and “standard.” The company notes that all rule-breaking content is meant to be excluded from ads regardless of what advertisers have opted into.</p><figure><img alt="Advertisers are getting new " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/50702470-3634-11ee-a5df-943e7b6ee818" style="height: 573px; width: 1290px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">X</div></figure><p>Under the most restrictive “conservative” setting, ads would be excluded from appearing near “targeted hate speech, sexual content, gratuitous gore, excessive profanity, obscenity, spam and drugs” in the “for You” timeline. The “standard” option would avoid the same topics, but allow spam and drug-related content, according to an example shared by X. The company also plans to add a “relaxed” setting for advertisers who want to “maximize reach” of their ads with the fewest limits on what can appear nearby.</p><p>The update isn’t the first time X has introduced tools to promote brand safety. The company previously added other keyword-based  <a href="https://business.twitter.com/en/blog/adjacency-controls-third-party-measurement.html"><ins>“adjacency controls”</ins></a> that were also meant to limit ad-buyers’ exposure to problematic content. But those changes, introduced in December,  seem to have had little effect on X’s ad business.&nbsp;</p><p>Though the company has repeatedly claimed that it has successfully <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-says-it-limited-the-reach-of-over-700000-tweets-that-violated-its-policy-063548086.html"><ins>limited</ins></a> the reach of hate speech on its site, researchers have said otherwise. Last month, <em>Bloomberg</em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-19/twitter-s-surge-in-harmful-content-a-barrier-to-advertiser-return?sref=10lNAhZ9"><ins>reported</ins></a> that researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) indicating hate speech has surged, both in terms of sheer volume and in engagement, since Musk’s takeover of the company. X <a href="http://v/"><ins>disputed</ins></a> the findings and is now <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musks-x-corp-sues-anti-hate-group-over-its-research-060156126.html"><ins>suing</ins></a> CCDH, alleging the group “illegally” scraped data.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/x-hopes-sensitivity-settings-will-bring-back-advertisers-215439809.html?src=rss

<p>YouTube announced today that it’s changing how its home page works if you have your watch history disabled. Starting today, the video service’s home feed will stop appearing for those with their viewing history turned off and “no significant prior watch history.” The change will provide a more streamlined browsing experience, showing only the search bar and guide menu.</p><p>“Starting today, if you have YouTube watch history off and have no significant prior watch history, features that require watch history to provide video recommendations will be disabled — like your YouTube home feed,” the company wrote in a <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/139222780?hl=en&amp;msgid=229405279">blog post</a> today. “This means that starting today, your home feed may look a lot different: you’ll be able to see the search bar and the left-hand guide menu, with no feed of recommended videos, thus allowing you to more easily search, browse subscribed channels and explore Topic tabs instead.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>YouTube says the changes will appear “slowly, over the next few months.” The company describes the move as making “it more clear which YouTube features rely on watch history to provide video recommendations and make it more streamlined for those of you who prefer to search rather than browse recommendations.”</p><p>YouTube says, once the change rolls out to your account, you can change your watch history settings to switch views at any time.

<p>Valve <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1688972619880804352">announced</a> today that it’s offering “certified refurbished” Steam Deck units. The renewed devices shave around 20 percent off the prices of their new counterparts, allowing you to pick one up for cheaper than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-steam-deck-is-up-to-130-off-during-the-steam-summer-sale-183053314.html">Steam Summer Sale</a> prices. The consoles include the same one-year warranty as new models. In addition, Valve <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1688972620937773057">announced</a> that GameStop is now selling Steam Deck refurbs in select stores, although its models are “refurbished at GameStop facilities and will come with their own warranty.”</p><p>At the time of publication, Valve has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamdeckrefurbished">all three Steam Deck tiers in stock</a>. The 64GB model costs $319, the 256GB variant is $419 and the 512GB one is sold for $519 — the same systems in new condition retail for $399, $529 and $649, respectively.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Valve says it thoroughly tests each unit before certifying it for resale. “Every device goes through a complete factory reset, software update, and an extensive examination involving over 100 tests at one of Valve’s facilities,” the company wrote. “Among the tests are all controller inputs, the audio system, the screen, and internals. Battery health is also assessed to ensure proper functionality and longevity.”</p><p>The company cautions that the renewed units “may have minor cosmetic blemishes,” but it promises “a reliable, high-quality gaming experience at a lower cost.” In addition to offering the same warranty as new consoles, the refurbished models include a power supply (also refurbished), carrying case and quick-start guide. Valve says refurbished Steam Deck stock is limited “and may fluctuate over time.” The company recommends checking its refurbished stock regularly if they’re sold out.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ffe106af-8248-4af3-9098-a2d4fd637766&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GameStop&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmZmUxMDZhZi04MjQ4LTRhZjMtOTA5OC1hMmQ0ZmQ2Mzc3NjYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2FtZXN0b3AuY29tL3N0ZWFtLWRlY2stbGF1bmNoLWxvY2F0b3IuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTUyZmJmMGItNmIzYS00YjdmLWEyNTAtOTY4YWI2NTY3NzdkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAdIo1xfFqczuRbuezbRzncdQ4OsUSmkWIzSB0EfD_C_9&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fsteam-deck-launch-locator.html">GameStop's refurbished Steam Decks</a> are also available today.

<p>Sony has reportedly begun <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-cloud-game-streaming-beta-rolling-out-to-ps-plus-premium-members">rolling out</a> a cloud streaming beta for PS Plus Premium subscribers — and it supports up to 4K resolution. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-is-testing-ps5-game-cloud-streaming-for-ps-plus-premium-users-181027926.html">Announced in June</a> as being in the “early stages” of development, the feature will support PS Plus catalog titles, game trials and “supported digital PS5 titles that players own.” The feature could help PlayStation owners avoid lengthy downloads that take up precious storage.</p><p>An alleged PlayStation email to an invited tester, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/15kxtd5/another_beta_for_playstation_plus_premium_members/">posted</a> on Reddit, reads, “We’re excited to unveil PS5 cloud streaming, and your help testing it means a lot to us.” The beta period uses exclusive invite codes that can’t be shared with other users.

## Amazon Prime Big Deal Days: Here's what to expect this October Prime Day

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day/">Amazon Prime Day</a> came and went in July, but Amazon’s not done with its membership-only sales events for 2023. The company just <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-prime-big-deals-day-october">announced</a> that it will hold another Prime Day of sorts in October, potentially mirroring what it did at the same time last year. This year’s event is dubbed “Prime Big Deal Days,” and at the moment, all we know about it is that it will be held sometime in October. Engadget will be surfacing all of the best tech deals we can find during the event – both on Amazon and elsewhere – but there are some important things to know ahead of time so you can get exactly what you want out of October Prime Day.</p><h2><strong>When is Prime Big Deal Days?</strong></h2><p>Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Days will take place in October 2023, but specific dates have not been announced yet. We’ll update this post once Amazon provides more information publicly.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Just like classic Prime Day, you’ll have to be a Prime subscriber to take advantage of most of the savings you’ll find on Amazon during the sale period. The company still offers a <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9hbWF6b25wcmltZT90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby0xc28tMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjRjMTgxZDQ2LTJlNmYtNDQxOS05YTcyLTliOWJmNzQzOTRmNSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAeKyhlTzDN2CQgXJf_DunfC53MBZfPmpY8l4qy-hEVEK&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Famazonprime">30-day free trial</a> to new Prime subscribers, so you can start your free trial ahead of the event to participate.</p><p>If you don’t pay for Prime and have no intention of doing so, you should still check out Amazon on October Prime Day for sales that are available to all shoppers.

However, the company also usually pushes out early Prime Day deals ahead of the event itself. We expect to see early access Prime Day deals this October, too.</p><p>Be they early Prime Day deals or day-of sales, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9iP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTFzby0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNGMxODFkNDYtMmU2Zi00NDE5LTlhNzItOWI5YmY3NDM5NGY1In0&amp;signature=AQAAAQOB6swEGA4K4-WJTWtme1-awzjjKTh5BsEUuCztHXVU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fb">Amazon gadgets</a> are almost guaranteed to be discounted during Prime Big Deal Days. You can safely bet on things like Echo speakers, Kindle e-readers and Fire TV devices to be on sale for Prime Day. And with this event being in October, it’s very likely that Amazon will use this Prime Day almost as an early Black Friday deal event for Prime subscribers: paying for Prime may get you Black Friday pricing on Amazon devices (and other gear) one month in advance.</p><p>Make no mistake, Amazon gadgets will not be the only items discounted on Prime Day. You’ll find clothes, shoes, household items, appliances, accessories and more on sale, but here at Engadget, we’ll naturally be focusing on electronics. We expect this October Prime Day to be like July’s, in that it will bring big discounts on headphones, earbuds, laptops, gaming accessories, SSDs and microSD cards, robot vacuums and more.</p><p>It’s also worth mentioning the types of deals we expect to see during October Prime Day. Some deals will be live for the entire 48 hours of the event, while others will be day one- or day two-only sales. Those are the hardest to predict, since Amazon usually does not give any indication how long a given sale will last. Our recommendation is to buy the things you’re most keen on as soon as you see them drop in price – that will ensure you get it while the discount is available, and while the item is still in stock.</p><p>You can also expect to see some “Lightning deals” happen during Prime Day. Thankfully, these are usually clearly labeled with the amount of time remaining to grab the sale price noted on the product page. In our experience, only a handful of these flash deals are actually worth your money — but if you see something that’s been on your wishlist drop in price for the next few hours, it’s in your best interest to grab it immediately.</p><h2><strong>How to prep for October Prime Day</strong></h2><p>We’ve alluded to this already, but it’s best to go into Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Days as prepared as possible. That means knowing exactly what you want to look for so you stay focused and avoid distractions. This is especially important for October Prime Day — Amazon used this event last year as an unofficial kickoff to the holiday shopping season, so if you want to get some of your gift buying done early, you’ll want to stay focused. The whole of Amazon.com will be overwhelming on Prime Day, so the less time you spend aimlessly browsing, the more your wallet will thank you later.</p><p>Two simple things you can do ahead of Prime Day are make a list and bookmark a price tracker. For the former, take note of the most important items you want to pick up on Prime Day. You can either do this the old-fashioned way on a sticky note, or you can use Amazon’s wish list feature. For the latter, add the items you want to buy on Prime Day to your wish list (or, even better, make a dedicated wishlist with only your Prime Day or holiday gifting desirables) and return to that list during the event. Not only will you have everything you want all in one place, but you’ll also be able to see which of those items are cheaper on Prime Day than they were when you originally added them.</p><p>As for the price tracker, sites like <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/">CamelCamelCamel</a> let you monitor the price of specific items on Amazon. You can check out price history charts and you can make your own price-drop alerts, receiving emails when something you want gets a discount. CamelCamelCamel also has some browser extensions you can download so you don’t have to navigate away from an Amazon product page to check its price history.</p><p>We know that not everyone – not even every Prime member – will be flocking to Amazon during Prime Big Deal Days. Whether you find such blatant displays of consumerism off putting or you simply don’t want to give Amazon more of your money, there are plenty of reasons why you might be skipping this all together. But that doesn’t mean you have to skip <em>all</em> of the sales that will be happening during that same time. Especially with it being so close to the holidays, retailers like Walmart, Target, Best Buy and others will most likely have competing Prime Day sales and we expect many of them will match the discounted prices you’ll find on Amazon. We recommend checking them out if you want to cross some items off your holiday shopping list for less, without spending money on Amazon.</p><p>Engadget will be covering October Prime Day in full, so if you have a lot of tech on your to-buy list, be sure to check back here on Prime Day for the best tech sales we could find. We’ll be sure to include gadgets from across the board – from headphones to robot vacuums to gaming gear – plus the best “anti-Prime Day” deals you can find from other retailers. You can also follow the <a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals">@EngadgetDeals Twitter account</a> and subscribe to the <a href="https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src">Engadget Deals newsletter</a> to stay up to date on the latest discounts. The volume of deals will be daunting, but we sift through them all and pick out the best ones to make Prime Day a bit easier for you.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-big-deal-days-heres-what-to-expect-this-october-prime-day-190035290.html?src=rss

<p>The Pokémon Company had a bunch of updates to share during its latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-next-pokemon-presents-event-takes-place-august-8th-152512734.html"><ins>Pokémon Presents stream</ins></a>. For one thing, it shared a new trailer for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/detective-pikachu-returns-lands-on-switch-october-6th-143306630.html"><em><ins>Detective Pikachu Returns</ins></em></a>, a long-awaited sequel that's coming to Nintendo Switch on October 6th.</p><p>For the uninitiated, <em>Detective Pikachu Returns</em> recasts the franchise's mascot as a hard-boiled, tough-talking detective. Detective Pikachu and his current partner Tim Goodman (who can actually understand Pikachu) get to the bottom of a string of unusual incidents with the help of some other Pokémon and humans, who live side-by-side in Ryme City. In between, Pikachu is drinking coffee or trying to find out just what happened to his missing partner, Harry (Tim's dad).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="cd5c348122cd42829d2e3aaaaac793ac"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>The cute trailer offers a look at some gameplay. You'll need to get your thinking cap on as you look for clues and use a casebook to solve cases. Other Pokémon will help you out by sniffing out clues or punching through walls. If the latest clip has you excited to play the game, you may be pleased to learn that pre-orders for <em>Detective Pikachu Returns </em>are now open.</p><p>Elsewhere, The Pokémon Company revealed that the first half of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-review-growth-and-growing-pains-140048933.html"><em><ins>Pokémon Scarlet </ins></em><ins>and </ins><em><ins>Violet</ins></em><ins>’s</ins></a> major paid expansion will arrive on September 13th. In &quot;The Teal Mask,&quot;  you'll go on a school trip to the land of Kitakami and meet Pokémon that aren't available in the Paldea region. The second half of the DLC, titled &quot;The Indigo Disk,&quot; is slated to arrive this winter.</p><div id="6874714551b54155aa400d6fb982aa9a"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>On top of that, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdzIDCjQM_E"><ins>Mew and Mewtwo are coming to </ins><em><ins>Scarlet </ins></em><ins>and </ins><em><ins>Violet</ins></em></a> as part of an event.

<p>Security makes money. Every day companies hawk their latest privacy and security features, be it on a billboard, an internet ad or a commercial in your favorite show. Like Apple’s <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/03/14/privacy-thats-iphone-ad-campaign-launches-highlights-apples-stance-on-user-protection"><ins>“Privacy. That’s iPhone”</ins></a> campaign, <a href="https://www.imore.com/new-duckduckgo-privacy-ad-shows-how-it-makes-sure-internet-trackers-are-duckduckgone"><ins>browsers like DuckDuckGo using privacy</ins></a> to set itself apart or the targeted Google cybersecurity ads on social media that I probably get because of my job. That’s good for consumer awareness on privacy, but adds new jargon and complexity to purchasing decisions.</p><p>This resurgence of privacy-focused ads has a lot to do with the popularity of data laws. That’s not to say advertising privacy is new, it dates back as far as these companies themselves, but regulation made compliance a selling point. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/gdpr/"><ins>General Data Protection Regulation</ins></a>, the <a href="https://search.engadget.com/search;_ylt=AwrFQBTtwspkwswMVTx8BWVH;_ylc=X1MDMTE5NzgwMjg3NgRfcgMyBGZyA2VuZ2FkZ2V0BGdwcmlkA1l5WUtLVFF1UzJhckliaXF4emswQkEEbl9yc2x0AzAEbl9zdWdnAzQEb3JpZ2luA3NlYXJjaC5lbmdhZGdldC5jb20EcG9zAzAEcHFzdHIDBHBxc3RybAMwBHFzdHJsAzQEcXVlcnkDY2NwYQR0X3N0bXADMTY5MTAwOTc4Ng--?p=ccpa&amp;fr2=sb-top&amp;fr=engadget"><ins>California Consumer Privacy Act</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/state-of-privacy-laws-in-us/"><ins>various other local laws</ins></a> popping up forced companies into prioritizing data privacy at the same time that consumers honed in on it, too.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Whitney Parker Mitchell, CEO and founder of Beacon Digital Marketing, told Engadget that behind the scenes, when the regulations get put in place, compliance folks get hired for buying decisions and privacy and security get a new emphasis. From there, companies make the decision to advertise or not advertise privacy and security compliance based on the target buyer in mind.</p><p>“Where you emphasize that and how much information you put forward within your marketing materials really depends on how important that is to that primary buyer,” Mitchell said. Like a cell phone that feels very personal may make security front of mind, but you may value convenience more than anything in a product like your robot vacuum.</p><p>Still, privacy and security are dense and complex, making the concepts less-than-ideal for pithy slogans. Oftentimes when marketers try to reduce it to something catchy, the important nuance gets lost or buzzwords blur reality. “The advertising campaigns can make the issue seem more simple or overly simplistic than it actually is,” Aaron Massey, technologist and senior policy analyst for advertising technologies and platforms at the Future of Privacy Forum said.</p><p>It's similar to the market for lemons — used cars, not the fruit — Massey told Engadget. It’s easy to make a marketing claim, but it’s very hard for the buyer to confirm that it’s true because they don’t have the specialized skill set to verify it.</p><p>So, to go along with the ad campaigns, more consumer-friendly privacy awareness is cropping up on our devices. “Companies are recognizing that privacy policies are not enough to really help consumers understand what is really happening with the data,” Cobun Zweifel-Keegan, DC managing director of the International Association of Privacy Professionals said. That includes efforts like privacy check ups that direct you to update your settings with a pop up at login.</p><p>It’s been a net positive for privacy and security. More regulation and consumer education has ultimately driven these ads. Still, there are things you should look out for before taking them at face value. While every ad can’t be <a href="https://twitter.com/DPL_rewind/status/1677533215110701056"><ins>a well-rounded and detailed approach</ins></a> to the topic, subjective claims like ‘We’re the most secure’ should raise skepticism. “It's best to look for claims that the company can clearly stand behind,” Zweifel-Keegan told Engadget, and the high-level staffing like chief privacy or security officers to back it up.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/tech-companies-data-privacy-ads-marketing-183049670.html?src=rss

## Netflix just released a game controller app for the iPhone

<p>Netflix’s push into video games continues, as the company just dropped a <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcHMuYXBwbGUuY29tL3VzL2FwcC9uZXRmbGl4LWdhbWUtY29udHJvbGxlci9pZDY0NDc1ODI1ODEiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImRmNjgzNzUxLTlhY2YtNDkxYS04ODY4LTFhNTM1Mzg2OGI5NCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfXQdjsfcmKv6Nez6HbpV6o1biefxEWUOsNd0NCA2rL2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fnetflix-game-controller%2Fid6447582581"><ins>dedicated controller app for iOS devices.</ins></a> The app, simply called “Netflix Game Controller,” lets you use your phone or tablet as a gamepad once you pair the device with your TV. This will allow you to play games available through Netflix’s service on the TV, while controlling things from your mobile device.</p><p>Though the app is already available for download, further news remains scant. For instance, we don’t know what games it will support or any details surrounding the pairing process. We also don’t know if and when this will be followed up by an Android app. The app’s description just teases that the gamepad functionality is “coming soon to Netflix.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This isn’t a huge surprise, given the company’s expanding growth as an indie game publisher. Netflix Games has published or hosted nearly 70 titles in the past two years, some of which are accessible via the regular Netflix streaming app with others available on mobile devices and gaming consoles. These aren’t throwaway titles, either, as games like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oxenfree-ii-lost-signals-will-hit-switch-netflix-steam-and-playstation-on-july-12th-173603739.html"><em><ins>Oxenfree II: Lost Signals</ins></em></a> released to critical acclaim. <em>Oxenfree </em>developer Night School has gone on to become <a href="https://www.engadget.com/why-the-oxenfree-ii-team-became-netflixs-first-game-studio-130035607.html"><ins>Netflix’s first in-house studio. </ins></a></p><p>Other titles coming to the Netflix platform in the coming months include indie standouts like <em>Storytellers, Paper Trail</em> and the <em>Monument Valley</em> series. There’s also an <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game in the works, along with a port of the mobile title <em>LEGO: Legacy Heroes Unboxed</em>. It’s a safe assumption that you should be able to use the recently-launched controller app to play some of these games. Engadget reached out to Netflix to inquire about compatibility and the possibility of an Android release. A company spokesperson said that it isn't making comments at this time.&nbsp;</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/netflix-just-released-a-game-controller-app-for-the-iphone-181609420.html?src=rss

<p>Since last year, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/netflix/"><ins>Netflix</ins></a> has run a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/discord/"><ins>Discord</ins></a> bot that helps people find shows and movies to watch together based on what's available in their location. The company is expanding the <a href="https://discordbotlist.com/bots/netflix"><ins>&quot;Hey, Netflix&quot; bot's</ins></a> capabilities today with a text-based game.</p><p>This is the first time Netflix is bringing a game along these lines to Discord. As you might imagine, it ties into something that you'll be able to stream on Netflix soon, an action movie called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuDwndGaCFo"><em><ins>Heart of Stone</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>that stars Gal Gadot and Jamie Dornan. The film will land on Netflix this Friday.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In <em>Heart of Stone: Maze of Odds</em>, you'll take on the role of a double agent (similar to Gadot's character in the film). Netflix says you'll need to quickly make decisions in &quot;action-driven situations.&quot; Based on some details that Netflix shared in advance, it seems that you'll need to choose between some preset options, much like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-12-netflix-interactive-shows-bandersnatch.html"><ins>interactive TV shows and movies</ins></a> it has released in the past.</p><p>Intriguingly, Netflix says <em>Heart of Stone: Maze of Odds</em> will be different each time you play it. The Discord bot randomly chooses scenarios from a bank of situations. Additionally, you'll be able to play it solo or ask friends to join in for multiplayer action. The game includes collectibles for you to pick up along the way too. Lastly, while Discord users around the world can check out the game, it's worth noting that it's only available in English.</p><p>Netflix has been making a big push into games in general over the last couple of years. Last month, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/why-the-oxenfree-ii-team-became-netflixs-first-game-studio-130035607.html"><ins>it released </ins><em><ins>Oxenfree II</ins></em></a>, the first game from one of its in-house studios. The company also just <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/08/08/netflix-game-controller-iphone-ipad/"><ins>debuted a game controller app</ins></a> for iPhone and iPad.

The high-end laptop chip, the M3 Max, will reportedly have four more high-performance CPU cores and at least two additional graphical cores compared to the M2 Max, which only <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-updates-its-mac-book-pros-with-m-2-pro-and-max-chips-143848558.html">arrived in January</a>.</p><p>The company is reportedly testing new iMacs, 13-inch MacBook Pros, 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Airs and Mac minis — all running the M3 chip and expected within the next 12 months. Updated 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M3 Pro and M3 Max chips won’t likely arrive until 2024.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company could move on an aggressive Mac release schedule as its desktop and laptop computer line struggles to regain its sales footing after a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/report-apple-sold-a-record-number-of-mac-books-last-quarter-091233817.html">pandemic-era boom</a>.

## The best cameras for 2023

<p>It’s a strange and wonderful time to buy a digital camera. Since smartphones have gutted the casual photography market, manufacturers are focusing on building technological marvels designed for very specific uses. Mirrorless cameras continue to improve in terms of autofocus, video and more. Action cams provide sharp, fluid video, compact cameras are targeted to both tourists and vloggers, and DSLRs are available at some of the best prices we’ve seen. With so many different types of digital cameras, though, you may need some guidance to find just the right one – and that’s where we come in. Whether you’re a creator looking for just the right vlogging camera, an aspiring wildlife photographer or a sports enthusiast, we’ll help you find the perfect camera system to match your budget and needs.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-cameras-151524327.html#mirrorlesscamerasunder2000">Best mirrorless cameras under $2,000</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-cameras-151524327.html#mirrorlesscamerasover2000">Best mirrorless cameras over $2,000</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-cameras-151524327.html#bestactioncamera">Best action cameras</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-cameras-151524327.html#bestcompactcamera">Best compact cameras</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-cameras-151524327.html#bestdslrcamera">Best DSLR cameras</a></p><h2>What to consider before choosing a camera</h2><p>There are a lot of reasons to choose a camera over a smartphone. The larger image sensors in mirrorless cameras let more light in, and you have a wide choice of lenses, from wide-angle to telephoto to zoom lenses, with far superior optics. Where smartphones have one f/stop, cameras have many, which gives you more exposure control. You also get natural and not AI-generated bokeh, quicker shooting, a physical shutter, more professional video results and so on.</p><p>With that extra quality comes a lot of extra factors to consider, however. The first thing is sensor size. In general, the larger the sensor size, the better (and usually more expensive) the camera.</p><p>Full frame is available on models like Sony's new ZV-E1, the Canon EOS R6 II and Panasonic S5 II. At a size equivalent to 35mm film (36 x 24mm), it offers the best performance in terms of image quality, low-light capability and depth of field. It's also the most expensive and finicky. While bokeh looks incredible at f/1.4, the depth of field is so razor thin that your subject's nose might be in focus but not their eyes. This can also make video shooting difficult.</p><div id="17e6cba906c140a2ad6d0203360809e0"></div><p>The next size category is APS-C (around 23.5 x 15.6mm for most models and 22.2 x 14.8mm for Canon), offered on Fujifilm's X Series lineup, Canon’s R10 and R50 and the Nikon Z50. It's cheaper than full frame, both for the camera body and lenses, but still brings most of the advantages like decent bokeh, high ISOs for low-light shooting and relatively high resolution. With a sensor size the same as movie cameras, it's ideal for shooting video, and it’s easier to hold focus than with full-frame cameras.</p><p>Micro Four Thirds (17.3 x 13mm), a format shared by Panasonic and Olympus, is the next step down in sensor size. It offers less bokeh and light-gathering capability than APS-C and full frame, but allows for smaller and lighter cameras and lenses. For video, you can still get reasonably tight depth of field with good prime lenses, but focus is easier to control.</p><p>The other common sensor size is Type 1 (1 inch), which is actually smaller than one inch at 12.7 x 9.5mm. That's used mostly by compact models like Sony’s ZV-1 vlogging camera. Finally, action cameras like the GoPro Hero 11 and DJI’s Osmo 3 have even smaller sensors (1/1.9 and 1/1.7 size, respectively).</p><p>For both amateur and professional photographers, another key factor is excellent autofocus (AF) speed and accuracy. Most modern mirrorless cameras have hybrid phase-detect AF systems that allow for rapid focus and fast burst speeds. The majority also feature AI smarts like eye-detect AF for people and animals. However, some models are just a bit faster and more reactive than others.</p><p>The electronic viewfinder (EVF) and rear display are also key. The best models have the sharpest and brightest EVFs that let you best judge a shot before taking it. For things like street photography, it’s best to have as bright and sharp a rear display as possible. You may also want a screen that flips out rather than just tilting.</p><p>DSLRs and mirrorless cameras let you change lenses, but you're stuck with what's built into a compact camera. While that's great for portability, a single lens means you're going to sacrifice something. Fujifilm's X100V, for instance, has a fast but fixed 35mm-equivalent f/2.0 lens and no zoom. Sony's RX100 V has a 24-70mm zoom, but it's slower at the telephoto end (f/2.8) and less sharp than a prime lens.</p><p>When it comes to video, there are other factors to consider. Does your camera do “pixel-binning” for video recording or read out the entire sensor? Better cameras tend to do the latter. Another key factor is sensor speed, as slower sensors tend to have more rolling shutter that can create a “jello” effect that skews video.</p><p>In addition, how’s the battery life? How do you like the handling and feel? How long can you shoot video before the camera heats up or stops? Does it support 10-bit HDR video? Is there a microphone and/or a headphone jack? (if you do a lot of interviews, it's preferable to have both.) How's the video autofocus? All of these things play a part in your decision – so now let’s take a look at the best models.</p><h2>The best cameras</h2><h3>Best mirrorless cameras</h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-mirrorless-cameras-133026494.html">Mirrorless</a> is far and away the biggest category of cameras for these days, so it’s the best way to go if you want the best camera for photography with the most advanced features. Both Canon and Nikon recently announced they’re discontinuing development of new DSLRs, simply because most of the advantages of that category are gone, as I detailed in a <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1ueVBLQkJlSHk2ayZ0PTFzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzNjg0YzFhZS03MTQ1LTRkYzItOWQ4OC0zMGRmZGZlZGFkYTIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAaSW4adeV86kjVHSaZugxT9y3OFpmPGeYld4L6Wu_zQd&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DnyPKBBeHy6k%26t%3D1s">recent video</a>. The biggest selling feature of a mirrorless camera is the ability to change lenses depending on the type of shooting you want to do.</p><p>The key features are sensor size, resolution, autofocus, shooting speeds and video specs. If you’re primarily focused on sports photography or outdoor photography, you’ll likely want fast shooting speeds and accurate autofocus. Portrait and landscape shooters will likely favor large sensors and high resolution to maximize image quality. And content creators will want to look for things like flip-out displays, high-end video specifications and good in-body stabilization. Price point is, of course, a major factor as well.</p><h2>Mirrorless cameras under $2,000</h2><h3>Best mirrorless camera under $2,000: Canon EOS R50</h3><p></p><p>My top budget camera pick is Canon’s brand new 24.2-megapixel <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=95276f3c-7b79-4c1e-803f-981cd9f7a968&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=B%26H+Photo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5NTI3NmYzYy03Yjc5LTRjMWUtODAzZi05ODFjZDlmN2E5NjgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmhwaG90b3ZpZGVvLmNvbS9jL3Byb2R1Y3QvMTc0ODgxMC1SRUcvY2Fub25fZW9zX3I1MF9taXJyb3JsZXNzX2NhbWVyYS5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzNjg0YzFhZS03MTQ1LTRkYzItOWQ4OC0zMGRmZGZlZGFkYTIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQGNPOAPTjbMo8fI_NOy6A_tkuqZ8i7BBW96k7vQwVHQ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1748810-REG%2Fcanon_eos_r50_mirrorless_camera.html">R50</a>, which is one of the best cameras for photography, and content creators will love it. It can shoot bursts at up to 15 fps in electronic shutter mode, and offers 4K 10-bit at up to 30p with supersampling and no crop. It has a fully articulating display, and unlike other cameras in this price range, an electronic viewfinder. It uses Canon’s Dual Pixel AF with subject recognition mode, and even has a popup flash. The only drawback is the lack of decent quality lens that’s as affordable as the camera itself, and a lack of in-body stabilization.</p><ul><li><p>Autofocus: Dual Pixel CMOS AF II with 651 points</p></li><li><p>Max shutter speed: 15 fps</p></li><li><p>WiFi: Yes</p></li><li><p>Bluetooth: Yes</p></li></ul><h3>Runner up: Canon EOS R8</h3><p></p><p>Full-frame cameras generally used to start at $2,000 and up, but Canon’s brand new <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9DYW5vbi1GdWxsLUZyYW1lLU1pcnJvcmxlc3MtTGlnaHR3ZWlnaHQtU21hcnRwaG9uZS9kcC9CMEJUVFRINUc2P3RoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tdXUtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjM2ODRjMWFlLTcxNDUtNGRjMi05ZDg4LTMwZGZkZmVkYWRhMiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAbAei0t33-uU6JuLpkMzHI1ExD4-TvaQaFb7I4kE3eBP&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCanon-Full-Frame-Mirrorless-Lightweight-Smartphone%2Fdp%2FB0BTTTH5G6%3Fth%3D1">EOS R8</a> is priced at just $1,500. It offers Canon’s excellent Dual Pixel AF with subject recognition AI, and can shoot bursts at up to 40 fps. It's equally strong with video, supporting oversampled 10-bit 4K at up to 60 fps. The R8 also offers a flip-out display, making it great for vloggers.

It even offers 5.9K 30p capture, along with RAW 5.9K external output to an Atomos recorder. You also get a flip-out screen for vlogging and updated five-axis in-body stabilization that’s the best in the industry. Photo quality is also good thanks to the dual-gain 24-megapixel sensor.

At the same time, GoPro’s latest models are more expensive than rivals.</p><h3>Best action camera: GoPro Hero 11 Black</h3><p></p><p>GoPro didn’t change the design on its latest model, but it has a larger sensor that enables a couple of cool features – Horizon Lock stabilization and Full Frame mode that makes it easier to shoot for, say, TikTok and YouTube at the same time.

It’s easily the best action camera on the market, but you pay for that: it’s $400 with a one year subscription ($500 without it), compared to $329 for the DJI Osmo Action 3 and $300 for the Insta360 RS 4K bundle.

Another popular model, Sony’s XV-1, is primarily aimed at content creators looking to step up.

You also get the same hybrid optical/electronic viewfinder, mechanical dials, film simulations and good looks as before. But the X100V is the most significant advancement in the series' history.

It does that job well thanks to a lightweight body, built-in high-quality microphone, flip-out display, best-in-class autofocus and excellent image quality. The 24-70mm lens is sharp, but it needs to be wider because of the 25 percent crop when using electronic stabilization. It also lacks a true touch display and a headphone port. That nitpicking aside, if you’re looking to step up from a smartphone or just want something simple, it does the job nearly perfectly.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-zv-1-vlogging-camera-review-162822651.html">Read our full review of the Sony ZV-1</a></p><h3>Another good option: Panasonic ZS-200</h3><p></p><p>For a value compact camera, the best option is Panasonic’s 20-megapixel <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9QQU5BU09OSUMtU3RhYmlsaXphdGlvbi1NZWdhcGl4ZWwtU2Vuc29yLURDLVpTMjAwUy9kcC9CMDc5UU5YRkNDP3RoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tdXUtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjM2ODRjMWFlLTcxNDUtNGRjMi05ZDg4LTMwZGZkZmVkYWRhMiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAUezUfxPy2h-trf4jyr95QCSAAv0yL6EO77foAFnUdtj&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPANASONIC-Stabilization-Megapixel-Sensor-DC-ZS200S%2Fdp%2FB079QNXFCC%3Fth%3D1">ZS-200</a>. It offers a lot of features for the price, like a 1-inch, 20.1 megapixel sensor, 5-axis stabilization, 4K, 30 fps video and more. Its main claim to fame, though, is the 24-360x lens that offers incredible reach for travel and more. Though it dates back to 2018, it’s actually one of the more recent compact models.</p><h2>Best DSLR camera</h2><p>With mirrorless cameras taking over the interchangeable lens market, DSLRs still give you the ability to change lenses at relatively cheap prices. The defining feature is the reflex mirror that lets you look directly through the lens at your subject with no electronics in between. Most also have very fast autofocus thanks to a dedicated phase-detect sensor, and very fast battery life. However, many lack features you’d expect on modern mirrorless cameras like subject tracking, eye-detection and more.</p><h3>Best DSLR camera: Nikon D850</h3><p></p><p>Nikon's full-frame (FX) <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9OaWtvbi1EODUwLUZYLUZvcm1hdC1EaWdpdGFsLUNhbWVyYS9kcC9CMDc1MjRMSE1UP3RoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tdXUtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjM2ODRjMWFlLTcxNDUtNGRjMi05ZDg4LTMwZGZkZmVkYWRhMiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAASKBTK1v7wIk9EBRLRFgcu_J1t23aEedlVLba83Si1V0&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNikon-D850-FX-Format-Digital-Camera%2Fdp%2FB07524LHMT%3Fth%3D1">D850</a> is the best deal on a high-end camera and arguably the best camera for photography. With a 45.7-megapixel sensor and max 102,400 ISO, it gives you the best quality for the money, whether mirrorless or DSLR. It can also shoot fast, at up to 7fps, which is very good for such a high-res camera. In addition, the battery life (1840 shots on a charge) puts any mirrorless option to shame, and there’s a massive number of FX Nikkor lens options to choose from. Nikon has upped its video game as well with the D850 by introducing 4K internal recording. If you’d still rather have a live optical rather than an electronic view, the D850 is the best option available.</p><ul><li><p>Autofocus: 153 points</p></li><li><p>Max shutter speed: 7 fps</p></li><li><p>WiFi: Yes</p></li><li><p>Bluetooth: Yes</p></li></ul><h3>Runner up: Canon EOS Rebel SL3</h3><p></p><p>Another one of the best cameras for photography is Canon’s 24-megapixel APS-C <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9DYW5vbi1SZWJlbC0xOC01NW1tLUxlbnMtV2hpdGUvZHAvQjA3UUhQVDc4MT90aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXV1LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzNjg0YzFhZS03MTQ1LTRkYzItOWQ4OC0zMGRmZGZlZGFkYTIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAASwImYIK8e5-fOTXlj2rbEEcYAUK69jT9uXLtHPplmJv&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCanon-Rebel-18-55mm-Lens-White%2Fdp%2FB07QHPT781%3Fth%3D1">EOS Rebel SL3</a>, which has a great blend of features, build quality and value.

The Spotify DJ is available to premium subscription members and provides algorithmic recommendations of what to listen to, just like any music streaming app. However, these recommendations are accompanied by AI-generated DJ commentary on what you’re listening to. So what’s the rub? The DJ, based on Spotify’s Xavier Jernigan, only speaks English, no matter where you live. This is not a big deal for Australia and New Zealand, but an annoying constraint for listeners in Ghana, Singapore and most other parts of the world. A Spotify spokesperson told Engadget that the company has “no more news to share on new languages at this time.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Despite the language limitation, it’s still a nifty toolset. It combines OpenAI’s proprietary large language model (LLM) technology, which powers ChatGPT, with Sonantic’s AI voice generation platform. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-buys-ai-voice-platform-sonantic-145242336.html"><ins>Spotify bought Sonantic last year,</ins></a> largely due to its focus on generating realistic speech.

<p>The UK's Electoral Commission has <a href="https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/privacy-policy/public-notification-cyber-attack-electoral-commission-systems"><ins>revealed</ins></a> that some personal information of around 40 million voters was left exposed for over a year. The agency — which regulates <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-11-15-uk-electoral-online-election-ad-funding.html"><ins>party and election finance</ins></a> and elections in the country — said it was the target of a “complex cyberattack.” It first detected suspicious activity on its network in October 2022, but said the intruders first gained access to its systems in August 2021.</p><p>The perpetrators found a way onto to the Electoral Commission's servers, which hosted the agency's email and control systems, as well as copies of the electoral registers. Details of donations and loans to registered political parties and non-party campaigners were not affected as those are stored on a separate system. The agency doesn't hold the details of anonymous voters or the addresses of overseas electors registered outside of the UK.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The data that was exposed included the names and addresses of UK residents who registered to vote between 2014 and 2022, along with those who are registered as overseas voters. Information provided to the commission through email and web forms was exposed too.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;We know that this data was accessible, but we have been unable to ascertain whether the attackers read or copied personal data held on our systems,&quot; the commission said. The agency confirmed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/08/electoral-commission-hack-40-million-uk-voters/"><em><ins>TechCrunch</ins></em></a> that the attack could have affected around 40 million voters. <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/elections/electoralregistration/bulletins/electoralstatisticsforuk/december2021"><ins>According to UK census data</ins></a>, there were 46.6 million parliamentary electoral registrations and 48.8 million local government electoral registrations in December 2021.</p><p>The Electoral Commission <a href="https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/privacy-policy/public-notification-cyber-attack-electoral-commission-systems/information-about-cyber-attack"><ins>says</ins></a> it had to adopt several measures before disclosing the hack. It had to lock out the &quot;hostile actors,&quot; analyze the possible extent of the breach and put more security measures in place to stop a similar situation from happening in the future.</p><p>Data in the electoral registers is limited and much of it is in the public domain already, the agency said. As such, officials don't believe the data by itself represents a major risk to individuals. However, the agency warned, it's possible that the information &quot;could be combined with other data in the public domain, such as that which individuals choose to share themselves, to infer patterns of behavior or to identify and profile individuals.&quot;</p><p>The Electoral Commission also noted that there was no impact on UK election security as a result of the attack. &quot;The data accessed does not impact how people register, vote, or participate in democratic processes,&quot; it said. &quot;It has no impact on the management of the electoral registers or on the running of elections. The UK’s democratic process is significantly dispersed and key aspects of it remain based on paper documentation and counting. This means it would be very hard to use a cyber-attack to influence the process.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/hack-left-majority-of-uk-voters-data-exposed-for-over-a-year-150045052.html?src=rss

## Why humans can't use natural language processing to speak with the animals

<p>We’ve been wondering what goes on inside the minds of animals since antiquity. <em>Dr. Doolittle’s</em> talent was far from novel when <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Doctor_Dolittle/ddcKgd_MWSwC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;printsec=frontcover">it was first published in 1920;</a> Greco-Roman literature <a href="https://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2021/2021.06.03/">is lousy with speaking animals</a>, writers in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Warring-States">Zhanguo-era China</a> routinely ascribed <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/13/7/654">language to certain animal species </a>and they’re also prevalent in Indian, Egyptian, Hebrew and Native American storytelling traditions.</p><p>Even today, popular Western culture toys with the idea of talking animals, though often through a lens of technology-empowered speech rather than supernatural force. The dolphins from both <a href="https://headhuntersholosuite.fandom.com/wiki/Darwin"><em>Seaquest DSV</em></a> and <a href="https://www.syfy.com/syfy-wire/chosen-one-of-the-day-jones-the-cyberpunk-dolphin-in-johnny-mnemonic"><em>Johnny Mnemonic</em></a> communicated with their bipedal contemporaries through advanced translation devices, as did <a href="https://pixar.fandom.com/wiki/Dug">Dug the dog</a> from <em>Up</em>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We’ve already got machine-learning systems and natural language processors that can translate human speech into any number of existing languages, and adapting that process <a href="https://www.engadget.com/can-ai-unlock-the-secrets-of-animal-communication-170040760.html">to convert animal calls into human-interpretable signals</a> doesn’t seem that big of a stretch. However, it turns out we’ve got more work to do before we can <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-23-animal-translation-technology-talk-to-me.html">converse with nature</a>.</p><h2>What is language?</h2><p>“All living things communicate,” an interdisciplinary team of researchers argued in 2018’s <a href="https://www.bio.purdue.edu/People/faculty/lucas/2019.Freeberg%20et%20al.ANBEHAV.pdf"><em>On understanding the nature and evolution of social cognition: a need for the study of communication</em></a>. “Communication involves an action or characteristic of one individual that influences the behavior, behavioral tendency or physiology of at least one other individual in a fashion typically adaptive to both.”</p><p>From <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12115">microbes, fungi and plants</a> on up the evolutionary ladder, science has yet to find an organism that exists in such extreme isolation as to not have a natural means of communicating with the world around it. But we should be clear that “communication” and “language” are two very different things.</p><p>“No other natural communication system is like human language,” argues the <a href="https://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/faq-how-did-language-begin">Linguistics Society of America</a>. Language allows us to express our inner thoughts and convey information, as well as request or even demand it. “Unlike any other animal communication system, it contains an expression for negation — what is not the case … Animal communication systems, in contrast, typically have at most a few dozen distinct calls, and they are used only to communicate immediate issues such as food, danger, threat, or reconciliation.”</p><p>That’s not to say that pets don’t understand us. “We know that dogs and cats can respond accurately to a wide range of human words when they have prior experience with those words and relevant outcomes,” Dr. Monique Udell, Director of the Human-Animal Interaction Laboratory at Oregon State University, told Engadget. “In many cases these associations are learned through basic conditioning,” Dr. Udell said — like when we yell “dinner” just before setting out bowls of food.</p><p>Whether or not our dogs and cats actually understand what “dinner” means outside of the immediate Pavlovian response —  remains to be seen. “We know that at least some dogs have been able to learn to respond to over 1,000 human words (labels for objects) with high levels of accuracy,” Dr. Udell said. “Dogs currently hold the record among non-human animal species for being able to match spoken human words to objects or actions reliably,” but it’s “difficult to know for sure to what extent dogs understand the intent behind our words or actions.”</p><p>Dr. Udell continued: “This is because when we measure a dog or cat’s understanding of a stimulus, like a word, we typically do so based on their behavior.” You can teach a dog to sit with both English and German commands, but “if a dog responds the same way to the word ‘sit’ in English and in German, it is likely the simplest explanation — with the fewest assumptions — is that they have learned that when they sit in the presence of either word then there is a pleasant consequence.”</p><figure><img src="https://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/ef915e841ebc0fa3537d17abbd4023a/206377384/dog.png" style="height: 1080px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tea Stražičić for Engadget/Silica Magazine</div></figure><h2>Hush, the computers are speaking</h2><p>Natural Language Programming (NLP) is the branch of AI that enables computers and algorithmic models to interpret text and speech, including the speaker’s intent,  the same way we meatsacks do. It combines computational linguistics, which models the syntax, grammar and structure of a language, and machine-learning models, which “automatically extract, classify, and label elements of text and voice data and then assign a statistical likelihood to each possible meaning of those elements,” <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing">according to IBM</a>. NLP underpins the functionality of every digital assistant on the market. Basically any time you’re speaking at a “smart” device, NLP is translating your words into machine-understandable signals and <em>vice versa</em>.</p><p>The field of NLP research has undergone a significant evolution in recent years, as its core systems have migrated from older Recurrent and Convoluted Neural Networks towards <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/transformer-novel-neural-network.html">Google’s Transformer architecture</a>, which greatly increases training efficiency.</p><p>Dr. Noah D. Goodman, Associate Professor of Psychology and Computer Science, and Linguistics at Stanford University, told Engadget that, with RNNs, “you'll have to go time-step by time-step or like word by word through the data and then do the same thing backward.” In contrast, with a transformer, “you basically take the whole string of words and push them through the network at the same time.”</p><p>“It really matters to make that training more efficient,” Dr. Goodman continued. “Transformers, they're cool … but by far the biggest thing is that they make it possible to train efficiently and therefore train much bigger models on much more data.”</p><h2>Talkin’ jive ain’t just for turkeys</h2><p>While many species’ communication systems have been studied in recent years — most notably cetaceans like <a href="https://www.projectceti.org/">whales</a> and <a href="https://www.dolphincommunicationproject.org/">dolphins</a>, but also the <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1600970113">southern pied babbler</a>, for its song’s potentially syntactic qualities, and <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c6c965be-a8ea-473d-89f4-9754f2675a60&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nature+Research&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjNmM5NjViZS1hOGVhLTQ3M2QtODlmNC05NzU0ZjI2NzVhNjAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmF0dXJlLmNvbS9zY2l0YWJsZS9rbm93bGVkZ2UvbGlicmFyeS9hbi1pbnRyb2R1Y3Rpb24tdG8tYW5pbWFsLWNvbW11bmljYXRpb24tMjM2NDg3MTUvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4MzliZWYxOC04OTFmLTQzMDEtYWM2Ni03Njk3N2U2MTRmM2UifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAR-MRlH5kg4o8BJDl7OlahRnXIKf_fJdn4F-E89GsNzx&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Fscitable%2Fknowledge%2Flibrary%2Fan-introduction-to-animal-communication-23648715%2F">vervet monkeys’ communal predator warning system</a> — none have shown the sheer degree of complexity as <a href="https://www.americanscientist.org/article/the-complex-call-of-the-carolina-chickadee">the call of the avian family Paridae</a>: the chickadees, tits and titmice.</p><p>Dr. Jeffrey Lucas, professor in the Biological Sciences department at Purdue University, told Engadget that the Paridae call “is one of the most complicated vocal systems that we know of. At the end of the day, what the [field’s voluminous number of research] papers are showing is that it's god-awfully complicated, and the problem with the papers is that they grossly under-interpret how complicated [the calls] actually are.”</p><p>These parids often live in socially complex, heterospecific flocks, mixed groupings that include multiple songbird and woodpecker species. The complexity of the birds’ social system is correlated with an increased diversity in communications systems, Dr. Lucas said. “Part of the reason why that correlation exists is because, if you have a complex social system that's multi-dimensional, then you have to convey a variety of different kinds of information across different contexts. In the bird world, they have to <a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2005/06/23/chickadees-alarm-calls-carry-information-about-size-threat-of-predator/">defend their territory</a>, talk about food, integrate into the social system [and resolve] mating issues.”</p><p>The chickadee call consist of at least six distinct notes set in an open-ended vocal structure, which is both monumentally rare in non-human communication systems and the reason for the Chickadee’s call complexity. An open-ended vocal system means that “increased recording of chick-a-dee calls will continually reveal calls with distinct note-type compositions,” explained the 2012 study, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3367703/"><em>Linking social complexity and vocal complexity: a parid perspective</em></a>. “This open-ended nature is one of the main features the chick-a-dee call shares with human language, and one of the main differences between the chick-a-dee call and the finite song repertoires of most songbird species.”</p><figure><img alt="Dolphin translation by Tea Stražičić" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/df723400-35f4-11ee-8e7f-9a864f4822c7" style="height: 1080px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tea Stražičić for Engadget/Silica Magazine</div></figure><h2>Dolphins have no need for kings</h2><p>Training language models isn’t simply a matter of shoving in large amounts of data. When training a model to translate an unknown language into what you’re speaking, you need to have at least a rudimentary understanding of how the the two languages correlate with one another so that the translated text retains the proper intent of the speaker.</p><p>“The strongest kind of data that we could have is what's called a parallel corpus,” Dr. Goodman explained, which is basically having a Rosetta Stone for the two tongues. In that case, you’d simply have to map between specific words, symbols and phonemes in each language — figure out what means “river” or “one bushel of wheat” in each and build out from there.</p><p>Without that perfect translation artifact, so long as you have large corpuses of data for both languages, “it's still possible to learn a translation between the languages, but it hinges pretty crucially on the idea that the kind of latent conceptual structure,” Dr. Goodman continued, which assumes that both culture’s definitions of “one bushel of wheat” are generally equivalent.</p><p>Goodman points to the word pairs ’man and woman’ and ’king and queen’ in English. “The structure, or geometry, of that relationship we expect English, if we were translating into Hungarian, we would also expect those four concepts to stand in a similar relationship,” Dr. Goodman said. “Then effectively the way we'll learn a translation now is by learning to translate in a way that preserves the structure of that conceptual space as much as possible.”</p><p>Having a large corpus of data to work with in this situation also enables unsupervised learning techniques to be used to “extract the latent conceptual space,” Dr. Goodman said, though that method is more resource intensive and less efficient. However, if all you have is a large corpus in only one of the languages, you’re generally out of luck.</p><p>“For most human languages we assume the [quartet concepts] are kind of, sort of similar, like, maybe they don't have ‘king and queen’ but they definitely have ‘man and woman,’” Dr. Goodman continued.  ”But I think for animal communication, we can't assume that dolphins have a concept of ‘king and queen’ or whether they have ‘men and women.’ I don't know, maybe, maybe not.”</p><p>And without even that rudimentary conceptual alignment to work from, discerning the context and intent of a animal’s call — much less, deciphering the syntax, grammar and semantics of the underlying communication system — becomes much more difficult. “You're in a much weaker position,” Dr. Goodman said. “If you have the utterances in the world context that they're uttered in, then you might be able to get somewhere.”</p><p>Basically, if you can obtain multimodal data that provides context for the recorded animal call — the environmental conditions, time of day or year, the presence of prey or predator species, etc — you can “ground” the language data into the physical environment. From there you can “assume that English grounds into the physical environment in the same way as this weird new language grounds into the physical environment’ and use that as a kind of bridge between the languages.”</p><p>Unfortunately, the challenge of translating bird calls into English (or any other human language) is going to fall squarely into the fourth category. This means we’ll need more data and a lot of different types of data as we continue to build our basic understanding of the structures of these calls from the ground up. Some of those efforts are already underway.</p><p>The Dolphin Communication Project, for example, employs a combination “<a href="https://www.dolphincommunicationproject.org/the-mva-and-ecd/">mobile video/acoustic system</a>” to capture both the utterances of wild dolphins and their relative position in physical space at that time to give researchers added context to the calls. Biologging tags — animal-borne sensors affixed to hide, hair, or horn that track the locations and conditions of their hosts — <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2020.0229">continue to shrink in size while growing in both capacity and capability</a>, which should help researchers gather even more data about these communities.</p><h2>What if birds are just constantly screaming about the heat?</h2><p>Even if we won’t be able to immediately chat with our furred and feathered neighbors, gaining a better understanding of how they at least talk to each other could prove valuable to conservation efforts. Dr. Lucas points to a recent study he participated in that found environmental changes induced by climate change can radically change how different bird species interact in mixed flocks. “What we showed was that if you look across the disturbance gradients, then everything changes,” Dr. Lucas said. “What they do with space changes, how they interact with other birds changes. Their vocal systems change.”</p><p>“The social interactions for birds in winter are extraordinarily important because you know, 10 gram bird — if it doesn't eat in a day, it's dead,” Dr. Lucas continued. “So information about their environment is extraordinarily important. And what those mixed species flocks do is to provide some of that information.”</p><p>However that network quickly breaks down as the habitat degrades and in order to survive “they have to really go through fairly extreme changes in behavior and social systems and vocal systems … but that impacts fertility rates, and their ability to feed their kids and that sort of thing.”</p><p>Better understanding their calls will help us better understand their levels of stress, which can serve both modern conservation efforts and agricultural ends. “The idea is that we can get an idea about the level of stress in [farm animals], then use that as an index of what's happening in the barn and whether we can maybe even mitigate that using vocalizations,” Dr. Lucas said. “AI probably is going to help us do this.”</p><p>“Scientific sources indicate that noise in farm animal environments is a detrimental factor to animal health,” Jan Brouček of the Research Institute for Animal Production Nitra, <a href="http://www.cvzv.sk/slju/14_2/8_Broucek.pdf">observed in 2014</a>. “Especially longer lasting sounds can affect the health of animals. Noise directly affects reproductive physiology or energy consumption.” That continuous drone <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fanim.2021.744207/full">is thought to also indirectly impact other behaviors</a> including habitat use, courtship, mating, reproduction and the care of offspring.&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, 2021’s research, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8698046/"><em>The effect of music on livestock: cattle, poultry and pigs</em></a>, has shown that playing music helps to calm livestock and reduce stress during times of intensive production. We can measure that reduction in stress based on <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168159121000514">what sorts of happy sounds those animals make</a>. Like listening to music in another language, we can get with the vibe, even if we can't understand the lyrics</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/why-humans-cant-use-natural-language-processing-to-speak-with-the-animals-143050169.html?src=rss

<p>Choosing the best Chromebook, given your needs and your budget, can be hard to do given the plethora of models on the market today. The combination of years worth of software updates and laptop manufacturers making more powerful and better-built laptops means there are a ton of good Chrome OS machines that work well as everyday drivers. But there are some special factors to Chromebooks that you should keep in mind before choosing one. From the Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5i to the Acer Chromebook Spin 714, our top picks will help you figure out which Chromebook is going to be worth it for you.</p><h2>What is Chrome OS, and why would I use it over Windows?</h2><p>That’s probably the number one question about Chromebooks. There are plenty of inexpensive Windows laptops on the market, so why bother with Chrome's operating system? Glad you asked. For me, the simple and clean nature of Chrome OS is a big selling point. Chrome OS is based on Google’s Chrome browser, which means most of the programs you can run are web based. There’s no bloatware or unwanted apps to uninstall like you often get on Windows laptops, it boots up in seconds, and you can completely reset to factory settings almost as quickly.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Of course, the simplicity is also a major drawback for some users. Not being able to install native software can be a dealbreaker if you’re a video editor or software developer. But there are also plenty of people who do the majority of their work in a browser. But Google and its software partners are getting better every year at supporting more advanced features. For example, Google <a href="https://support.google.com/photos/thread/208682996/bring-your-creativity-to-life-with-photos%E2%80%99-new-video-editing-features-on-chromebook?hl=en">added video editing tools</a> to the Google Photos app on Chromebooks – it won’t replace Adobe Premiere, but it should be handy for a lot of people.</p><p>Google has also added support for Android apps on Chromebooks, which greatly expands the amount of software available. The quality varies widely, but it means you can do more with a Chromebook beyond just web-based apps. For example, you can install the Netflix app and save videos for offline watching. Other Android apps like Microsoft Office and Adobe Lightroom are surprisingly capable, as well. Between Android apps and a general improvement in web apps, Chromebooks are more than just a browser.</p><h2>What do Chromebooks do well?</h2><figure><img alt="Three Chromebook laptops stacked on top of each other, fanning out a bit, on top of a desk protector on a wooden table." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-08/38bdd2f0-2488-11ed-affd-31657bb03b0c" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>Put simply, web browsing and really anything web based. Browsing, streaming music and video and using various social media sites are among the most common daily tasks people do on Chromebooks. As you might expect, they also work well with Google services like Photos, Docs, Gmail, Drive, Keep and so on. Yes, any computer that can run Chrome can do that too, but the lightweight nature of Google Chrome OS makes it a responsive and stable platform.</p><p>As I mentioned before, Chrome OS can run Android apps, so if you’re an Android user you’ll find some nice ties between the platforms. You can get most of the same apps that are on your phone on a Chromebook and keep info in sync between them. You can also use some Android phones as a security key for your Chromebook or instantly tether your laptop to use mobile data.</p><p>Google continues to tout security as a major differentiator for Chromebooks, and I think it’s definitely a factor worth considering. The first line of defense is auto-updates. Chrome OS updates download quickly in the background and a fast reboot is all it takes to install the latest version. Google says that each webpage and app on a Chromebook runs in its own sandbox, as well, so any security threats are contained to that individual app. Finally, Chrome OS has a self-check called Verified Boot that runs every time a device starts up. Beyond all this, the simple fact that you generally can’t install traditional apps on a Chromebook means there are a lot fewer ways for bad actors to access the system.</p><p>As for when to avoid them, the answer is simple: If you rely heavily on a specific native application for Windows or a Mac, chances are you won’t find the exact same option on a Chromebook. That’s most true in fields like photo and video editing, but it can also be the case in law or finance. Plenty of businesses run on Google’s G suite software, but more still have specific requirements that a Chromebook might not match. If you’re an iPhone user, you’ll also miss out on the way the iPhone easily integrates with an iPad or Mac. For me, the big downside is not being able to access iMessage on a Chromebook.</p><p>Finally, gaming Chromebooks are not ubiquitous, although they’re becoming a <em>slightly</em> more reasonable option with the rise of cloud gaming. In late 2022, Google and some hardware partners announced a push to make Chromebooks with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-cloud-gaming-chromebooks-asus-lenovo-acer-130030080.html">cloud gaming</a> in mind. From a hardware perspective, that means laptops with bigger screens that have higher refresh rates as well as optimizing those laptops to work with services like NVIDIA GeForce Now, Xbox Game Pass and Amazon Luna. You’ll obviously need an internet connection to use these services, but the good news is that playing modern games on a Chromebook isn’t impossible. You can install Android games from the Google Play Store, but that’s not what most people are thinking of when they want to game on a laptop.</p><p>There’s another potential change on the horizon, as Valve and Google are working to bring the massive Steam catalog to Chromebooks. Right now, Steam is only available as an early alpha on a handful of devices with higher specs, but it works a lot better than I expected. Of course, you’re still not going to run the most demanding games on basic laptops, but the Steam catalog is so vast that there are plenty of titles that worked on the Chromebook I tested it with. Hopefully, Steam will be supported on more devices soon, <a href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/steam-on-chromeos/">but the list</a> is somewhat limited at the moment.</p><h2>What are the most important specs for a Chromebook?</h2><figure><img alt="Acer Chromebook Spin 713" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/28c4bed0-cd37-11eb-a7ff-de290c52cdf7" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>Chrome OS is lightweight and usually runs well on fairly modest hardware, so the most important thing to look for might not be processor power or storage space. That said, I’d still recommend you get a Chromebook with a relatively recent Intel processor, ideally a 10th-gen or newer Intel i3. Most non-Intel Chromebooks I’ve tried haven’t had terribly strong performance, but that’s starting to change – as we evaluate more of these Chromebooks, we’ll recommend ones that have enough power to be good everyday computers.</p><p>As for RAM, 8GB should be the target, unless you’re looking for a budget model and know that your needs are fairly modest. Storage space is another place where you don’t need to spend too much; 64GB should be fine for almost anyone. If you plan on storing a lot of files locally or loading up your Chromebook with Linux or Android apps, get 128GB. But for what it’s worth, I’ve never felt like I might run out of storage when using Chrome OS.</p><p>Things like the keyboard and display quality are arguably more important than sheer specs. The good news is that you can find less expensive Chromebooks that still have pretty good screens and keyboards that you won’t mind typing on all day. Many cheap Chromebooks still come with tiny, low-resolution displays, but at this point there’s no reason to settle for anything less than 1080p. (If you’re looking for an extremely portable, 11-inch Chromebook, though, you’ll probably end up with a lesser screen.) Obviously, keyboard quality is a bit more subjective, but there are plenty of affordable options that offer strong typing experiences.</p><p>Google has an Auto Update policy for Chromebooks, and while that’s not a spec, per se, it’s worth checking before you buy. Basically, Chromebooks get regular software updates automatically for about six years from their release date (though that can vary from device to device). <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/6220366?hl=en">This support page</a> lists the Auto Update expiration date for virtually every Chromebook ever, but a good rule of thumb is to buy the newest machine you can to maximize your support.</p><h2>How much should I spend?</h2><p>Chromebooks started out notoriously cheap, with list prices often coming in under $300. But as they’ve gone more mainstream, they’ve transitioned from being essentially modern netbooks to the kind of laptop you’ll want to use all day. As such, prices have increased a bit over the last few years. At this point, you should expect to spend at least $400 if you want a solid daily driver. There are still many budget options out there that may be suitable as secondary devices, but Chromebooks that can be an all-day, every-day laptop will cost a bit more.</p><p>There are also plenty of premium Chromebooks that approach or even exceed $1,000, but I don’t recommend spending that much. Generally, that’ll get you a better design with more premium materials, as well as more powerful internals and extra storage space. Of course, you also sometimes pay for the brand name. But, the specs I outlined earlier are usually enough. That said, if money is no object, there are a few really fabulous options out there.</p><p><strong>See Also:</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-laptops-120008636.html"><strong>Best Laptops for 2023</strong></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-laptops-172033838.html"><strong>Best Gaming Laptops</strong></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-2-in-1-laptops-173038508.html"><strong>Best 2-in-1 Laptops for 2023</strong></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-affordable-windows-laptops-123000512.html"><strong>Best Cheap Windows Laptops</strong></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-laptops-for-students-130054631.html"><strong>Best Laptops for College Students </strong></a></p></li></ul><h2>Best bang for your buck: Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5i</h2><p></p><p>Lenovo has been making some of the best affordable Chromebooks you can buy for several years now, and the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9MZW5vdm8tMi0xLUNocm9tZWJvb2stQ29tcHV0ZXIvZHAvQjA5Uk5DTjNZVj90aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTNyLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3MWNhMzU1ZS1iZTA2LTNiYTItYTg0YS0zZTU1YTE5ZGJjODQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWR6WZjttzosh6Ce0d6Fpj3kauddLu2r8ficQD_ifAjY&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLenovo-2-1-Chromebook-Computer%2Fdp%2FB09RNCN3YV%3Fth%3D1">IdeaPad Flex 5i</a> is an affordable laptop that provides just about everything you could want in a basic Chromebook. The 13.3-inch, 1080p touchscreen is extremely bright and fairly sharp; I wish it had a taller aspect ratio than 16:9, but it’s pretty common in Chromebooks. This Lenovo Chromebook runs on a 11th-generation Intel Core i3 processor and includes 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. While the processor is starting to show its age, it should still be sufficient for most tasks. Eight hours of battery life is pretty good for a laptop in this price range, and the backlit keyboard is excellent for such an affordable device. The key caps feel a little small under my fingers, but that’s the only real complaint I have.</p><p>Other things in the Flex 5i’s favor include that it has both USB-C and USB-A ports, a microSD card slot and a security lock. At three pounds and 0.66 inches thick, it’s not the lightest or slimmest option out there, but it’s totally reasonable considering the price. Finally, the Flex 5i will receive software and security updates until June of 2029, so you can buy this computer and have it covered for years to come.</p><p>Ultimately, the Ideapad Flex 5i hits the sweet spot for a lot of Chromebook buyers out there, providing a level of quality and performance that’s pretty rare to find at this price point. That said, given this laptop has been out for over a year now, we’re keeping an eye out for a replacement from Lenovo, as well as comparable options other manufacturers release.</p><p>The Lenovo Flex 5i is no longer available directly from Lenovo, but you can commonly find it on Amazon for about $400 (as of this writing, it is selling for $368). That’s an outstanding value.</p><h2>Upgrade option: Acer Chromebook Spin 714</h2><p></p><p></p><p><a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BY2VyLUNocm9tZWJvb2stMi1Ub3VjaHNjcmVlbi1CdWlsdC9kcC9CMEJKSDlMR0s4P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTNyLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3MWNhMzU1ZS1iZTA2LTNiYTItYTg0YS0zZTU1YTE5ZGJjODQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAX1QeRQ01eSgnQlMtotxLWXdsieMp9lLHwOn72xLOT_S&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAcer-Chromebook-2-Touchscreen-Built%2Fdp%2FB0BJH9LGK8">Acer’s Chromebook Spin 714</a> has long been one of the best premium Chromebook options out there, and this year’s update is no exception. It’s a modest tweak to the 2022 model, but given how good that computer is I have no issues recommending the latest edition. We haven’t tested it yet, but Acer will have a review model for us soon.</p><p>The Spin 714 features a 14-inch, 1900x1200 touchscreen. That works out to a taller 16:10 aspect ratio than you’ll get from the 1080p panels on most Chromebooks. I’m a big fan of taller laptop screens, and while this isn’t as luxurious as the few 3:2 ratio Chromebooks on the market, it’s still a comfortable and high quality screen.</p><p>One noteworthy new feature is the 2K webcam included in the Spin 714. In a world where we’re all doing more video calls than we’d like, having a camera that doesn’t reduce you to a blurry spot is definitely appreciated.</p><p>As for the rest of the hardware, the 13th-generation Intel Core i5 processor should be more than enough power for most tasks, and the keyboard and trackpad on the 2022 model are solid, if not the best. The same can be said for battery life: I got about seven hours using the Spin 714 in my normal daily routine. That’s not exceptional, but it’s in line with what I’ve seen on other i5-powered Chromebooks. Rounding out the hardware is 8GB of RAM and a generous 256GB of storage space. The latest Spin 714 model isn’t listed on Google’s support page, but last year’s model is supported until June 2030; the latest model’s window should run through June of 2031.</p><p>Another bonus is that its hardware meets Google’s recommended specs to run Steam, so gamers might want to give it a shot and see what games they can install.</p><p>Just as the name suggests, the Spin 714 has a 360-degree hinge which lets you use the laptop in tablet mode. I’m not a fan of this convertible design – I don’t know who wants to use a 3-plus pound tablet, but Acer did include a built-in stylus for handwriting notes or drawing in apps like the built-in Chrome Canvas.</p><p>The latest Spin 714 costs $700 – not an unreasonable price for a computer with these specs and built quality. For most people, the Lenovo model will be enough. But, if you’re a serious multitasker, want a better display and keyboard, or just want a computer that’ll last as long as possible, the Acer Spin 714 is easy to recommend. We’ll update this guide once we receive our test model from Acer so we can give updated impressions, particularly on battery life.</p><h2>A good large-screen option: Acer Chromebook 516 GE</h2><p></p><p>Acer introduced the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BY2VyLUNocm9tZWJvb2stNTE2LUdFLWk1LTEyNDBQL2RwL0IwQlZWVEwzODg_dGg9MSZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby0zci0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNzFjYTM1NWUtYmUwNi0zYmEyLWE4NGEtM2U1NWExOWRiYzg0In0&amp;signature=AQAAAeMPwDw6u8YHqYCk03cgZETQzsbwwkoyPvHFf1lC0Mi_&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAcer-Chromebook-516-GE-i5-1240P%2Fdp%2FB0BVVTL388%3Fth%3D1">Chromebook 516 GE</a> in the fall of 2022 as part of Google’s push to make devices suitable for cloud gaming, but you don’t need to be a gamer <a href="https://www.engadget.com/acer-chromebook-516-ge-hands-on-preview-170011142.html">to appreciate this laptop</a>. For $650, you’ll get a 16-inch display with a 2,560 x 1,600 resolution and a 120hz refresh rate. NVIDIA’s GeForce now gaming service supports up to 4K visuals at 120hz on its Ultimate tier so you’ll get to see those benefits. This laptop also supports Steam, yet another reason gamers might be interested in trying it. But even non-gamers should enjoy the 516 GE’s crisp and clear screen and refined hardware.</p><p>It also includes Intel’s 12th-gen Core i7 1240P processor, 8GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage. Given the laptop’s size, it’s good that Acer didn’t skimp on ports here: there’s an HDMI port, USB-C, USB-A, ethernet and a headphone jack. The keyboard has gamer-friendly LED lights that you can customize, but more importantly it’s just a solid and comfortable keyboard, whether you’re playing games or just typing up reports. The trackpad is large and responsive, as well.</p><p>The 516 GE only weighs 3.75 pounds too – pretty light for a laptop with a 16-inch screen. Between the powerful hardware, solid design, good trackpad and keyboard and great screen, anyone who wants a bigger Chromebook will likely be happy with this model. As for support, Google says the 516 GE will continue receiving updates until June of 2030.</p><h2>Honorable mention: HP Dragonfly Pro Chromebook</h2><p></p><p>If you just want the nicest Chromebook you can buy, with top-shelf specs and design, the $999 <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8a0e8870-4cf8-4bda-935c-af7c00c28e2b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=HP+Store&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4YTBlODg3MC00Y2Y4LTRiZGEtOTM1Yy1hZjdjMDBjMjhlMmIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaHAuY29tL3VzLWVuL3Nob3AvcGRwL2hwLWRyYWdvbmZseS1wcm8tY2hyb21lYm9vay0xNmdiLWJrIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3MWNhMzU1ZS1iZTA2LTNiYTItYTg0YS0zZTU1YTE5ZGJjODQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAATmD35Ks726xdz2LVY7LDZXAS0u_pQiizwieyaJc96qW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fpdp%2Fhp-dragonfly-pro-chromebook-16gb-bk">HP Dragonfly Pro Chromebook</a> might meet your needs. For starters, the screen is an absolute stand out. It’s a 14-inch, 2,560 x 1,600 touchscreen that maxes out at an extremely bright 1,200 nits.</p><p>The keyboard and trackpad, meanwhile, are probably the best I’ve tested lately. The keyboard has an extremely satisfying clickiness when you’re typing. It’s no mechanical keyboard, but it felt reassuringly solid and there was no real adjustment period needed when I started banging away on this laptop. The large trackpad is excellent, with great responsiveness and a solid click. There’s also a fingerprint reader so you can unlock the laptop without a password, another premium feature that I wish I saw in more Chromebooks.</p><p>From a specs perspective, the Dragonfly Pro includes a 12th-gen Core i5 i5-1235U processor – not the absolute latest, but plenty of power nonetheless. That’s matched with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, and I definitely noticed the extra RAM makes a difference in responsiveness across the board.</p><p>Other niceties include an 8-megapixel webcam, a shooter that exceeds what you’ll find on most laptops, whether they’re in this price range or not. HP did this without resorting to a huge bezel, either – the top bezel is thicker than the ones on the side, but not so much that the laptop feels unbalanced. And the Bang &amp; Olufsen quad speaker setup is shockingly good. With volume set to about 33 percent, the laptop was plenty loud to fill my office, and it was also fairly well balanced, with prominent bass, surprising stereo separation and clear highs. These are definitely some of the best laptop speakers I’ve ever heard.</p><p>That said, there is a major caveat here. The HP Dragonfly Pro’s battery life is poor — under 5 hours poor, which is very disappointing for a $999 laptop. It’s bad enough that I went back and forth on recommending this device. People who don’t travel a lot and do most of their work at their desk might not care, but in that case, why bother getting one of the thinnest and lightest Chromebooks out there?</p><p>The other downside is that you don’t get a variety of ports here – just four USB-C, and no headphone jack. That’s not a total dealbreaker, as I don’t often find myself plugging much into my Chromebooks, but again it’s definitely worth knowing.</p><p>This laptop is otherwise a total delight to use, as it is extremely well built, powerful and features a great keyboard and screen. I definitely wouldn’t recommend it to everyone with these battery issues, but if you want one of the nicest Chromebooks you can buy and don’t spend a ton of time away from a charger (and have plenty of disposable income), you’ll probably enjoy the Dragonfly Pro.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-chromebooks-160054646.html?src=rss

<p>Typically, smart grills equal pellet grills. While pellet models played a key role in popularizing connected outdoor cooking, there are plenty of other options for controlling and monitoring things from the comforts of your living room. After introducing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-25-harvard-barbecue-desora-kamado-joe-cinder-grills.html">a smart controller</a> for its ceramic grills in 2018, Kamado Joe released <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kamado-joe-pellet-joe-ceramic-smart-grill-specs-price-availability-201946770.html">its own connected pellet version</a> in 2020. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kamado-joe-konnected-joe-grill-price-specs-133020818.html">Earlier this year</a>, the company combined its add-on controller with its popular charcoal-burning red cookers, resulting in the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=346ae41c-5265-49ce-a119-79bad16046d5&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Home+Depot&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNDZhZTQxYy01MjY1LTQ5Y2UtYTExOS03OWJhZDE2MDQ2ZDUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaG9tZWRlcG90LmNvbS9wL0thbWFkby1Kb2UtS29ubmVjdGVkLUpvZS0xOC1pbi1EaWdpdGFsLUNoYXJjb2FsLUdyaWxsLWFuZC1TbW9rZXItd2l0aC1BdXRvLUlnbml0aW9uLWFuZC1XaS1GaS1UZW1wZXJhdHVyZS1Db250cm9sLUtKMTUwNDExMjMvMzIyNzA1MDM2IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4ZTM3ZDJjYy1iNWYyLTQ4MGYtYjIwNC0zMjgyYmVjYmU4NGEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAeSiQg_z4m2agZxV7ktpZJTAt5xo4gemufYTvNQw_Cd9&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.homedepot.com%2Fp%2FKamado-Joe-Konnected-Joe-18-in-Digital-Charcoal-Grill-and-Smoker-with-Auto-Ignition-and-Wi-Fi-Temperature-Control-KJ15041123%2F322705036">Konnected Joe</a>.</p><p>At first glance, the Konnected Joe looks like any other ceramic grill in Kamado Joe’s lineup. However, the bottom half is black where most of the company’s other options are solid red. The display (or Kontrol Board) also sets the Konnected Joe apart, and it’s situated beside three food probe jacks, the power button and a temperature dial. Here, you can see temperature graphs, select a cook mode and receive alerts. The grill will also advise you on how to adjust the vents based on your selected temperature. Buttons on the left allow you to set timers and reconnect to WiFi, in addition to adjusting the display to show grill or food temperatures in large numbers visible from afar.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p></p><p>The Konnected Joe retains a lot of the features that make the company’s ceramic grills great for your deck or patio. The Kontrol Tower top vent, Air Lift hinge and heavy-duty cart all make using the grill easier. Inside, the company’s two-tier Divide &amp; Conquer design allows you to cook different foods at different temperatures by changing the proximity of the stainless steel grates to the fire. You can also set up one side for direct grilling while using a heat deflector for indirect on the other. Most of the components for the grill are semi-circular, which makes the Konnected Joe just as versatile as a regular Kamado Joe. The folding side shelves are modestly sized, but they’re enough to hold a plate, tray or small cutting board.</p><p>Kamado Joe’s latest smart grill is compatible with all of the accessories for the Classic Joe grill, except for the charcoal basket. This means you can add a rotisserie (JoeTisserie), pizza stone (DoJoe) and more to expand the capabilities of the Konnected Joe. There’s a ton of options here, ranging from the affordable half-moon reversible griddle ($70) to the pricey JoeTisserie ($300), with some bundles going for even more. You don’t need to purchase anything extra to get started with the Konnected Joe, though. The grill ships with grates, heat deflectors for low-and-slow cooking and all you need for that optional two-tier configuration.</p><figure><img alt="Kamado Joe put its smart-grilling expertise into a WiFi-connected model with all the benefits of a ceramic cooker. Charcoal offers unique flavor and versatility while the company sells a range of accessories to expand the grill’s toolbox. The companion app is a work in progress, but it does well with the basics. Plus, that Automatic Fire Starter will save you lots of headaches. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/5c19c8b3-3555-11ee-b7ff-0d8a68a6ceee" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Just under the three food probe jacks is a dedicated button for the Automatic Fire Starter (AFS). WiFi connectivity may get the bulk of the attention on this Kamado Joe, but the AFS is the real star. It’s essentially a heating element at the bottom of the cooking chamber where you load your charcoal and wood chunks. When you turn it on, it runs for 15 minutes to light your charcoal without any additional lighter fluid or fire starters. I’ve used this every time I’ve cooked with the Konnected Joe, even when I’m otherwise running the grill in Classic Cook Mode without the automatic temperature control. It consistently, completely lit up the charcoal. See ya later, charcoal chimney.</p><p>In addition to built-in WiFi, another key aspect of smart grilling is a mobile app. The Kamado Joe App allows you to adjust time and temperature without being directly in front of the grill. During my tests, changes were typically quick although there have been a few times I had to input the desired temperature twice to get it to stick. Those temperature graphs from the onboard display are here as well, alongside the ability to browse recipes and monitor food probe temps. However, where Kamado Joe currently lags behind the competition is its library of recipes and how they’re presented.</p><p>Right now, there are over 150 recipes available in the Kamado Joe app, organized by food type and cooking method. For comparison, the Traeger app currently houses over 1,000. The Kamado Joe app is also missing a few glaring items, like pulled pork, but the company says it continuously adds new recipes. It also said it’s working to bring recipe videos and step-by-step guidance to the app sometime next year. These are two more items that both Traeger and Weber offer in their apps and they can be a big help when you’re trying a new recipe or are a beginner griller. Still, the app does a solid job with the basics of monitoring and controlling the grill.</p><figure><img alt="Kamado Joe app" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/1fa7b4b0-3559-11ee-beff-91f1adb33ddb" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Another area the Kamado Joe app could offer guidance is preparing the grill to cook. There are some tips in recipes, like waiting for clean smoke when you add wood chunks before putting any food on, but there aren’t any tips on how much charcoal to add in the first place. This is a lesson I learned the hard way, as the Konnected Joe would consistently overshoot the set temperature during low-and-slow smoking in my initial tests.</p><p>After consulting with the company, I determined I was using too much charcoal and the extra fuel was igniting before I needed it during the longer sessions. Using less at the start fixed my problem, but extended cooking times may require you to add more. This means moving your food and any racks to the side to access the bottom of the chamber. It’s not ideal, but it’s hardly a dealbreaker.</p><p>None of this means much if the grill can’t produce great-tasting food, and the Konnected Joe does an excellent job in that regard. Since this is mostly a Kamado Joe ceramic grill with some smart-cooking bits added on, its performance is similar to those non-WiFi models. You get the flavor of charcoal, which has a more pronounced smoky essence than pellet grills produce. Sure, you can impart plenty of smoke with wood pellets, but what you get from charcoal is just different. And, at least to me, it’s slightly more intense. You also get the flavor of charcoal through direct cooking for a true grilled essence as opposed to hot-and-fast searing on a pellet grill.</p><figure><img alt="Kamado Joe put its smart-grilling expertise into a WiFi-connected model with all the benefits of a ceramic cooker.

This included a lot of steaks, a Boston Butt for pulled pork, baby back ribs and more. I was consistently impressed by the charcoal smoke flavor present in all of my cooks, especially in the longer sessions for the pork shoulder and ribs. What’s more, the Konnected Joe allows you a bit more room to experiment with types of wood as you add chunks to supplement the charcoal. There are different kinds of pellets intended for different foods, but sometimes those aren’t a single type of wood even if they're labeled as such. For example, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=de57025b-1082-4622-af33-0312dca51a60&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Weber+USA&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJkZTU3MDI1Yi0xMDgyLTQ2MjItYWYzMy0wMzEyZGNhNTFhNjAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2ViZXIuY29tL1VTL2VuL2FjY2Vzc29yaWVzL2FjY2Vzc29yaWVzLWJ5LWdyaWxsLXR5cGUvd29vZC1wZWxsZXQtZ3JpbGwtYWNjZXNzb3JpZXMvY2hlcnJ5LWFsbC1uYXR1cmFsLWhhcmR3b29kLXBlbGxldHMlQzIlQTAvMTkwMDA1Lmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjhlMzdkMmNjLWI1ZjItNDgwZi1iMjA0LTMyODJiZWNiZTg0YSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfXrDxRDqLgJABdExZTvE1XdqAlpzjZo0OXfAdVPycOc&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.weber.com%2FUS%2Fen%2Faccessories%2Faccessories-by-grill-type%2Fwood-pellet-grill-accessories%2Fcherry-all-natural-hardwood-pellets%25C2%25A0%2F190005.html">Weber’s Cherry pellets</a> are 60 percent Maple. With the Konnected Joe, you can grab a bag of a single type of wood chunks (I use Kingsford) and change them up based on what you’re cooking.</p><p>Another thing you need to be aware of (and this applies to ceramic grills in general) is the long cool-down period. Due to the nature of the materials, these models retain heat a lot more efficiently than a kettle or gas grill – or even most pellet options. This is great while you’re cooking, but it also means you need to plan for an extended time for the grill to cool off before you can put the cover on. As an example, I finished cooking ribs around 5PM at a temperature of 275 degrees (a five-hour cook). When I locked up for the night around 11PM, the grill was still warm to the touch, so I couldn’t cover it yet. High-heat searing required even more time to cool off, and in most cases, I had to leave the grill uncovered until the next day.</p><figure><img alt="Kamado Joe put its smart-grilling expertise into a WiFi-connected model with all the benefits of a ceramic cooker.

You only need to use the included ash tool to scrape debris through the holes in the bottom of the cooking chamber, leaving larger pieces of used charcoal for the next cook. A tray inside the bottom vent slides out for easy disposal. If there’s a large amount of ash, you may need to use the tool to scrape that slot, but you shouldn’t need to get out the shop vac like you do for a pellet grill. Of course, the accessories may require a thorough scrubbing after use, but that’s nothing some grill cleaner or soapy water can’t handle.</p><p>If you’re looking for a charcoal-burning alternative to the Konnected Joe, you don’t have to go far. Parent company Middleby Outdoor also owns the Masterbuilt brand that has the Gravity Series smart grills <a href="https://www.engadget.com/masterbuilt-gravity-series-560-review-smart-charcoal-grill-160050858.html">we tested in 2020</a>. While the Gravity Series 560 was the first version, the company has since introduced the larger <a href="https://www.engadget.com/masterbuilt-gravity-series-800-grill-smoker-wifi-griddle-140047644.html">Gravity Series 800</a> that comes with a griddle insert and the <a href="https://www.masterbuilt.com/products/gravity-series-1050-digital-charcoal-grill-smoker">Gravity Series 1050</a> with the largest cooking capacity of the trio.</p><p>The design is the same across all three models: a gravity-fed hopper on the right side funnels charcoal down to a digitally-controlled fan to maintain temperatures. You can add wood chunks to the ash bin to produce more smoke. The Gravity Series is capable of hot-and-fast searing, low-and-slow smoking and everything in between, all with the ability to monitor temperatures from your sofa. One key issue with those grills is they can be difficult to light when you have used charcoal at the bottom of the hopper, so it’s best to cycle through and have fresh fuel to light, mixing any used bits mid-chamber.</p><figure><img alt="Kamado Joe put its smart-grilling expertise into a WiFi-connected model with all the benefits of a ceramic cooker.

In addition to full-featured apps for monitoring and controlling the grill from afar, Traeger and Weber both offer easy-to-follow recipe guidance. Both companies also give you estimated completion times in their apps (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/traeger-grills-wireless-meat-thermometer-meater-acquisition-183944452.html">via Meater for Traeger</a>) so you have an idea of when to have the sides ready (and to keep hungry guests informed of the situation).</p><p>What’s more, pellet grills don’t require you to futz with components to add more fuel as you simply refill the hopper outside of the cooking area if you start to run low.

A connected grill and all the convenience that it affords has never been cheap, but the Konnected Joe pairs all the versatility of a ceramic cooker with the advantages of charcoal and performs well. If the company can expand and refine its companion app, this grill will be a complete package – even if it commands a steep investment.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/kamado-joe-konnected-joe-review-a-highly-versatile-smart-grill-140043770.html?src=rss

## Marvel's visual effects workers vote to join a union

<p>Marvel's visual effects employees have voted in favor of joining a union in their fight for better pay, overtime compensation, more benefits and better treatment. According to <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2023/08/vfx-workers-vote-to-unionize-at-marvel-for-the-first-time.html"><em>Vulture</em></a>, a supermajority of the company's 50 on-set VFX employees have filed a petition for an election with the National Labor Relations Board. They're hoping to join the Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE), which also represents hair and makeup artists, wardrobe, lighting and prop personnel, among other workers. Because apparently, despite Marvel's reliance on visual effects to make its universe(s), superheroes and supervillains look real on the big screen, its VFX artists aren't represented by a union. IATSE has also been <a href="https://iatse.net/growing-our-union-further/">campaigning</a> broadly to expand its membership into VFX and animation workers in recent months.</p><p>Several current and former VFX employees for the company previously spoke out about grueling schedules and breaking down under pressure while working on shows and movies for the studio. Sources told <a href="https://sea.ign.com/she-hulk-2/189387/news/pressure-crunch-blacklist-fears-the-mcus-visual-effects-artists-speak-out"><em>IGN</em></a> that people were being given tasks that were impossible to finish within the timeframe allowed to complete them. Some VFX artists told <em>Vulture</em> that the hectic production schedule for <em>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</em>, for instance, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-review-bad-vfx-130036373.html">led to rushed work</a> and an end product that many reviewers had described as &quot;bland.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>VFX coordinator Bella Huffman said: &quot;Turnaround times don't apply to us, protected hours don’t apply to us, and pay equity doesn’t apply to us. Visual effects must become a sustainable and safe department for everyone who's suffered far too long and for all newcomers who need to know they won’t be exploited.&quot;</p><p><em>Vulture</em> says a strike by Marvel's VFX artists is not out of the question. It is a common tactic employed by workers seeking to organize, after all — plus, both the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hollywood-writers-are-officially-on-strike-084059607.html">Writers Guild</a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/striking-actors-say-rejected-ai-proposal-would-let-studios-use-their-likeness-without-fair-pay-000025878.html">Screen Actors Guild</a> are currently on strike to demand better pay,  streaming residuals from successful shows and regulation of AI use in Hollywood.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/marvels-visual-effects-workers-vote-to-join-a-union-123036176.html?src=rss

## The best PS5 games for 2023
 - [https://www.engadget.com/best-games-for-ps5-playstation-5-171511880.html?src=rss](https://www.engadget.com/best-games-for-ps5-playstation-5-171511880.html?src=rss)

<p>Welcome to Engadget’s best PS5 games list. As always, we have looked for games that generally offer meaningful improvements over their last-gen counterparts when played on PS5, or are exclusive to the system. We'll be updating this periodically, so, if a game's just been released and you don't see it, chances are that the reason for its absence is that we haven't played through it yet. Either that or we hate it.</p><h2>Stray</h2><p></p><p><em>Stray</em> a perfectly contained adventure game that has you embodying a cat in a post-apocalyptic world humans have left behind. It has plenty of fresh ideas, each one pared down to its purest form. Plenty of actions in <em>Stray</em> exist simply because they make sense for a cat protagonist (and probably because they’re cute as hell). There’s a discrete button to meow, and the robots the cat shares its world with react with shock and frustration when you cut across their board game, throwing pieces to the floor. It’s possible to curl up and sleep basically any time, anywhere – even directly on top of a robot stranger. When the cat gets pets and cuddles from the robots, it purrs and the DualSense’s haptics fire up in response. The environmental puzzles take advantage of this cat-level perspective, inviting players to look at the world with different, light-reflective eyes.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As well as puzzle-solving, ledge-leaping and blob-dodging, <em>Stray</em> introduces a world of lighthearted dystopia, where robots don’t hate the humans that came before them. Instead, they attempt to cultivate plants that can survive in the dark, just because people would have liked that. Compared with most dystopian cyberpunk games, <em>Stray</em> is downright joyful.</p><h2>Dead Space</h2><p></p><p>The<em>&nbsp;</em><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9EZWFkLVNwYWNlLVBsYXlTdGF0aW9uLTUvZHAvQjBCUlA4WVlGNC8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZHgtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjQ1MmQ2NzI5LWYxMzYtNDc1Yy05YmM1LTU4ZjhlMGViY2M2NCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAerWwB99hdMp6SS7bxHlZf5X5Xn9MTyWugOsMzIyCbbv&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDead-Space-PlayStation-5%2Fdp%2FB0BRP8YYF4%2F"><em>Dead Space</em></a> remake feels like a warm, juicy hug from a murderous necromorph, and we mean that in the best way possible. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dead-space-remake-playstation-5-review-160019905.html">2023 version</a> of <em>Dead Space</em> spit-shines the mechanics that made the original game so magically horrific back in 2008, and it doesn’t add any unnecessary, modern bloat. The remake features full voice acting, new puzzles and expanded storylines, and it introduces a zero-gravity ability that allows the protagonist, Isaac Clarke, to fly through sections of the game in an ultra-satisfying way.</p><p>None of these additions outshine the game’s core loop: <em>stasis, shoot, stomp</em>. Isaac gains the ability to temporarily freeze enemies and he picks up a variety of weapons, but he never feels overpowered; he’s always in danger. Mutilated corpse monsters appear suddenly in the cramped corridors of the space station, charging at Isaac from the shadows, limbs akimbo and begging to be shot off. The first <em>Dead Space</em> popularized the idea that headshots don’t matter and the remake stays true to this ethos – yet its combat rhythm still feels fresh.</p><p>The 2023 version of <em>Dead Space</em> proves that innovative game design is timeless (and so are plasma cutters).</p><h2><strong>Gran Turismo 7</strong></h2><p></p><p>If you enjoy sim-style racing games, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9HcmFuLVR1cmlzbW8tNy1TdGFuZGFyZC1QbGF5U3RhdGlvbi01L2RwL0IwOVNXNkdDR0wvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWR4LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0NTJkNjcyOS1mMTM2LTQ3NWMtOWJjNS01OGY4ZTBlYmNjNjQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAU11iNqSnv8jl-hqI5s9GXD6G4TlpHq6Ni8cmWKuT1_y&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGran-Turismo-7-Standard-PlayStation-5%2Fdp%2FB09SW6GCGL%2F"><em>Gran Turismo 7</em></a> is the PS5’s only real choice. The main tenets that’ve made <em>Gran Turismo </em>a gaming staple are still here: a handling and physics model that demands precision but isn’t so realistic that you need a wheel or intense skill to play; the intensity of learning how a specific car meshes with a specific track; truly stunning visuals; that odd mix of rock, jazz and orchestral music in the soundtrack. Most of all, there remains a deep love of the automobile, from sexy speed demons to unwieldy boxes from years ago. More than this, <em>Gran Turismo 7</em> is <em>romantic</em> about cars, not just for how they look, but how they represent years of collective labor and passion. There’s a singular style and voice here that just doesn’t exist in most sports games.</p><p>There was lots of anger around <em>Gran Turismo 7</em>’s microtransactions, amount of content and event payouts around launch – just look at that <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/gran-turismo-7">Metacritic user score</a> – and the fact that it’s effectively always-online is still a major detraction. But if you’re starting today, you’ll have hundreds of hours of things to do, and you shouldn’t feel the need to grind for credits until far down the road. And that’s assuming you aren’t interested in racing against other players online, which is where the game should be most lively for years to come.</p><h2>Elden Ring</h2><p></p><p>Did you think this list would not include <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9FbGRlbi1SaW5nLVBsYXlTdGF0aW9uLTUvZHAvQjA5NzQzRjhQNi9yZWY9c3JfMV8xP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWR4LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0NTJkNjcyOS1mMTM2LTQ3NWMtOWJjNS01OGY4ZTBlYmNjNjQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQbWiQz7OlFyfay67eLN9ZhbHhcR1M0QjvW6eOMbURUl&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FElden-Ring-PlayStation-5%2Fdp%2FB09743F8P6%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>? The strengths of FromSoftware’s latest action-RPG are many, but what’s most impressive about the game is how hand-crafted it feels despite its scale. <em>Elden Ring</em> is big, but it never feels like it’s wasting your time. Far from it; FromSoftware has created a rich open world, with something surprising, delightful or utterly terrifying around every corner. I’ll never forget the moment I found a chest that teleported my character to a cave full of Eldritch monsters. <em>Elden Ring </em>is full of those kinds of discoveries.</p><p>And if you’re worried about hitting a brick wall with <em>Elden Ring’s</em> difficulty, don’t be. Sure, it can be tough as nails, but it’s also From’s most accessible game to date as well. If you find combat overly punishing, go for a mage build and blast your enemies from afar. And if all else fails, one of the rewards for exploring <em>Elden Ring’s </em>world is experience that you can use to make your character stronger.</p><h2>God of War: Ragnarök</h2><p></p><p>2018’s <em>God of War</em> was a brilliant reinvention for a franchise that was in desperate need of a reboot. For an encore, all Sony’s Santa Monica Studio did was every single stake they could. <em>God of War Ragnarök </em>is a massive adventure, taking protagonist Kratos and his son Atreus all over the nine Norse realms as they prepare for Ragnarök, a mythical event essentially meant to bring about the end of the world. Along the way, Kratos and Atreus get up close and personal with even more of the Norse gods, including stunning encounters with the drunken but deadly Thor and, of course, Odin himself.</p><p>The combat in <em>Ragnarök</em> remains one of the most satisfying gaming experiences I can think of – it’s fluid and extremely customizable. And once you get into a groove and power up Kratos, it’s truly a god-like experience. There’s also a much greater variety of enemies this time out, from the smaller grunts you mow through to bigger and more intense boss battles. There are more realms to visit, more sidequests than ever and an endgame sequence that’s up there with the biggest battles any God of War game has ever put to screen. The backdrop for all this is some of the most beautifully detailed and varied environments you can find, from the swampy confines of Vanaheim and the fiery to the frozen tundra of Midgard. On the PS5, you can choose between native 4K visuals or high frame rates up to 120Hz, provided your TV can handle it.</p><h2>The Last of Us</h2><p></p><p><em>The Last of Us</em> and its sequel may have originally come out for the PS3 and PS4, respectively, but they also provide two excellent PS5 experiences. <em>The Last of Us Part I</em> is a complete visual remake for the PS5 of the 2013 original, with massively improved character models and environments, along with native 4K visuals or frame rates up to 120 fps. <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9MYXN0LVVzLVBhcnQtSUktUGxheVN0YXRpb24tNC9kcC9CMDdESlJGU0RGP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWR4LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0NTJkNjcyOS1mMTM2LTQ3NWMtOWJjNS01OGY4ZTBlYmNjNjQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYeyu0p_pWAyd4mjRvmr54p4LzrpcsVkQLHQwtS4Ftws&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLast-Us-Part-II-PlayStation-4%2Fdp%2FB07DJRFSDF"><em>The Last of Us Part II</em></a> originally launched for the PS4 in 2020, and developer Naughty Dog released a patch for it last year unlocking 60 fps gameplay on the PS5. There weren’t any other major updates, but the game already looked amazing on the PS4 so there wasn’t a ton to change here. Either way, the PS5 is the best place to experience these two games.</p><p>Both games feature a sprawling post-pandemic adventure story, following survivors Joel and Ellie through a gorgeously rendered but terrifying world where zombie-like Infected and regular humans alike are out for your blood. You’ll never really feel like you have enough supplies to survive, so you need to make every shot count – or figure out how to sneak around enemies or craft tools that’ll get you out of tight spots. There’s an ever-present sense of danger in these games, while the stories focus on human connection in all its messy glory; the tone is often extremely grim, but there are moments of levity, humor and hope sprinkled throughout the ruined world. <em>The Last of Us Part I</em> and <em>Part II</em> both put you through an intense, violent and emotional experience, but they remain a journey worth taking.</p><h2>Rollerdrome</h2><p></p><p><em>Rollerdrome</em> is lush. It’s incredibly stylish, taking cues from 1970s Hollywood sci-fi but with an attractive cel-shaded filter over every scene. Even better than its stunning visuals, <em>Rollerdrome</em> has smooth, precise mechanics that allow players to fall into a flow in every level. The game is all about gliding through the environments on rollerblades, picking up speed and doing tricks while dodging and shooting enemies, managing weapons and controlling time – and it all comes together in a thrilling dystopian bloodsport.</p><p>It’s a joy to dodge, dodge, dodge and then leap into the air, slow down time and take out the people shooting at you, refilling ammo and collecting health in the process. Meanwhile, an unsettling story of corporate greed unfolds naturally beneath the rollerblading bloodshed, keeping the stakes high. <em>Rollerdrome</em> was a sleeper hit of 2022, so if you’ve been napping on this one, now’s the time to wake up and play.</p><h2>Overwatch 2</h2><p></p><p>Even though Blizzard has improved the onramp for new players this time around, <em>Overwatch 2 </em>still has a steep learning curve. Stick with it, though, and you’ll get to indulge in perhaps the best team shooter around. <em>Overwatch 2</em> has a deceptively simple goal — stand on or near an objective and keep the other team away long enough to win. It’s much more complex in practice. To the untrained eye, matches may seem like colorful chaos, but <em>Overwatch 2</em> has a deceptively simple goal — stand on or near an objective and keep the other team away long enough to win.</p><p>It’s much more complex in practice. Blizzard reduced the number of players on each team from six to five. That, along with across-the-board character tweaks, has made gameplay faster-paced and more enjoyable compared with the original <em>Overwatch</em>. There's a greater emphasis on individual impact, but you'll still need to work well with your teammates to secure a victory.</p><p>Now featuring a cast of more than 30 heroes, each with distinct abilities and playstyles, you’ll surely find a few <em>Overwatch 2</em> characters that you can connect with. The first batch of new heroes are all a blast to play. There are many great (though often fairly expensive) new skins to kit them out with too. The game looks and sounds terrific too, thanks to Blizzard’s trademark level of polish. At least until you figure out how to play <em>Overwatch 2</em>, you can marvel at how good it looks.</p><h2>Astro’s Playroom</h2><p></p><p>It’s odd to start a best games list with a title that comes free with the console, but if you’re anything like my son, who swiftly deleted <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wbGF5c3RhdGlvbi5jb20vZW4tdXMvZ2FtZXMvYXN0cm9zLXBsYXlyb29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNDUyZDY3MjktZjEzNi00NzVjLTliYzUtNThmOGUwZWJjYzY0In0&amp;signature=AQAAARyhZ2-STAUhBsc4fQ5UbMgeniWiOVLoWpihjV5FSKpr&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fastros-playroom%2F"><em>Astro’s Playroom</em></a> to make space for various Call of Duty titles, I’m here to tell you to give the pack-in title another shot. <em>Astro’s Playroom</em> is a love letter to both 3D platformers and the PlayStation itself. It’s also, to date, the title that makes the best use of Sony’s DualSense controller, with incredible haptic feedback and clever usage of the pad’s adaptive triggers. (Although, eight years on, I’m still not convinced anyone has found a compelling reason for that touch pad.) It’s a game that even completionists can finish within six hours or so, but those six hours were among the most fun I’ve had with the PS5 so far.</p><h2><strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake: Intergrade</strong></h2><p></p><p>We thought it would never happen. <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> was an iconic JRPG that’s credited with opening up the genre to the west. It peppered the Top 10 lists of the best games of all-time and introduced the long-running Japanese RPG series to polygons, 3D maps, and countless other innovations of 32-bit consoles. 23 years later, and three PlayStation iterations later, Square Enix dared to remake, not remaster, the game. It would be, contentiously, episodic, expanding out the story of Midgar and the opening part of the game into a single game.</p><p>It’s all very different. It’s also gorgeous, with a modern battle system that no longer focuses on static characters and menu choices. Somehow, and we were ready to be underwhelmed, the battle system works. <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ffe106af-8248-4af3-9098-a2d4fd637766&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GameStop&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmZmUxMDZhZi04MjQ4LTRhZjMtOTA5OC1hMmQ0ZmQ2Mzc3NjYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2FtZXN0b3AuY29tL3ZpZGVvLWdhbWVzL3BsYXlzdGF0aW9uLTUvcHJvZHVjdHMvZmluYWwtZmFudGFzeS12aWktcmVtYWtlLWludGVyZ3JhZGUtLS1wbGF5c3RhdGlvbi01LzI5Njk1NS5odG1sPyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNDUyZDY3MjktZjEzNi00NzVjLTliYzUtNThmOGUwZWJjYzY0In0&amp;signature=AQAAAafv3Epls3ZHNu7i50nd9W8E6u-MoLqkBxudJ5uF16H3&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fproducts%2Ffinal-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade---playstation-5%2F296955.html%3F"><em>FF7R’s</em></a> fights are slicker and more enjoyable than those in Final Fantasy XV, the latest entry in the series. Each character, from iconic mercenary Cloud through to eco-terrorist Barret and flower girl Aerith, play in entirely different ways, using the space between themselves and enemies in very different ways. Some sub-missions and distractions feel like they’re there solely to eke some more hours out of your playthrough, but the world of the original has been thoughtfully reimagined, so it’s a minor complaint.</p><p>For anyone that bought the PS4 iteration, the upgrade to PS5 is free. However, it costs money to gain access to the PS5-exclusive DLC chapter featuring ninja Yuffie. Offering another battle style to experiment with and master, two new extra chapters run alongside the events of the first installment of this remake. Moments of the game feel like they were built to tease how capable the newest PlayStation is, with Yuffie zipping down poles through vertiginous levels, wall-running and mixing up long-range and short-range attacks in a completely different way to Cloud, Aerith and the rest. It suffers a little from trying to tie in <em>FF7</em> lore from old spin-off titles, but it’s a satisfying distraction as we wait for the second part – <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> – to arrive in 2023.</p><h2>Demon's Souls</h2><p></p><p>Bluepoint’s <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9EZW1vbnMtU291bHMtUGxheVN0YXRpb24tNS9kcC9CMDhGQzVUVEJGP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWR4LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0NTJkNjcyOS1mMTM2LTQ3NWMtOWJjNS01OGY4ZTBlYmNjNjQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUF0PsZEHi2Zg-LFgwFicrQJiToXGJ6Ch6zVDmU354H3&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDemons-Souls-PlayStation-5%2Fdp%2FB08FC5TTBF"><em>Demon’s Souls</em></a> remake won’t be for everyone — no Souls game is. The original <em>Demon’s Souls</em> was a sleeper hit in 2009 on the PS3, establishing the basic formula that would later be cemented with <em>Dark Souls</em>, and then aped by an entire industry to the point where we now essentially have a “Soulslike'' genre. Today, that means challenging difficulty, grinding enemies for souls to level up, the retrieval of your corpse to collect said souls, a labyrinthine map to explore and, if you’re doing Soulslike right, some show-stopping boss fights to contend with. As a progenitor to the genre, <em>Demon’s Souls</em> has most of those in abundance. But rather than a huge sprawling map, it uses a portal system, with mini labyrinths to work through. Its bosses are also not quite on the level of impressiveness or difficulty of a more modern Dark Souls game.</p><p>Bluepoint has been faithful to the original, then, but graphically <em>Demon’s Souls </em>is a true showcase of what the PS5 can do, with gorgeous high-resolution visuals, smooth frame rates and swift loading. While the graphics certainly catch your eye, it’s the smoothness and loading times that are the most impactful. The original ran at 720p, and… depending on what you were doing 25 to 30 fps, while the remake lets you pick between a locked 30 or 60 fps at 4K or 1440p. And in a game that will likely kill you hundreds of times, waiting two seconds to respawn instead of thirty is transformative.</p><h2>God of War</h2><p></p><p>Sony's God of War series had laid dormant for half a decade when its latest incarnation hit stores in early 2018, and for good reason. Antiquated gameplay and troubling themes had made it an ill-fit for the modern gaming landscape. No more.

Kratos is now a dad, the camera is now essentially strapped to his shoulder and Sony has what is sure to become a new series on its hands.</p><p>The first outright PS4 game on this collection, <em>God of War</em> has at least been patched for better performance on PS5, allowing it to output at 4K/60.

There are multiple betrayals, the sad deaths of several close allies, tense sword fights, villages and castles under siege, and even a ‘Kurosawa mode’ black-and-white filter you employ for the entire game. The world of feudal Japan, with some creative liberties, is gorgeous, with fields of grass and bullrushes to race through on your faithful steed, temple ‘puzzles’ to navigate around and fortresses to assess and attack.</p><p>As you make your way through the main story quest, and more than enough side quests and challenges, you unlock more powerful sword techniques and stances, as well as new weapons and forbidden techniques that are neatly woven in the story of a samurai pushed to the edge. It still suffers from one too many fetch quests, artifacts scattered across Japan’s prefectures, but the sheer beauty of <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> tricks you into believing this is the greatest open-world game on PlayStation. Don’t get me wrong — it’s up there.</p><p>With the new <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9HaG9zdC1Uc3VzaGltYS1EaXJlY3RvcnMtQ3V0LVBTNS9kcC9CMDk4VFY1WFBYP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWR4LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0NTJkNjcyOS1mMTM2LTQ3NWMtOWJjNS01OGY4ZTBlYmNjNjQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARgfrm2sRkVOyaOOpEDs4J94q79CF_7IfAGfd7-N9qo1&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGhost-Tsushima-Directors-Cut-PS5%2Fdp%2FB098TV5XPX%3F"><em>Director’s Cut</em></a> edition on the PS5, you also get dynamic frame-rates up to 60 FPS, ensuring the game looks and feels even more like a tribute to Japanese cinematic auteurs of the past. There are also DualSense tricks, like a bow that tangibly tightens as you pull on trigger buttons, and subtle rumble as you ride across the lands of Tsushima, <em>Director’s Cut </em>adds a new, surprisingly compelling DLC chapter. As you explore the Iki isle, the game adds a few more tricks to Jin’s arsenal, and deepens the relationship and history between the game’s hero and his father.</p><p>Without spoiling what happens, the game smartly threads the original story into the DLC, ensuring it feels solidly connected to the main game, despite DLC status.</p><h2>Deathloop</h2><p></p><p><a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ffe106af-8248-4af3-9098-a2d4fd637766&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GameStop&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmZmUxMDZhZi04MjQ4LTRhZjMtOTA5OC1hMmQ0ZmQ2Mzc3NjYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2FtZXN0b3AuY29tL3ZpZGVvLWdhbWVzL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2RlYXRobG9vcC0tLXBsYXlzdGF0aW9uLTUvMjMyODUwLmh0bWw_IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0NTJkNjcyOS1mMTM2LTQ3NWMtOWJjNS01OGY4ZTBlYmNjNjQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWAEepFdrgDmk9qK3G2VKJY-JF2vj9AMhIWZwXeKGDX5&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fproducts%2Fdeathloop---playstation-5%2F232850.html%3F"><em>Deathloop</em></a>, from the studio that brought you the Dishonored series, is easy enough to explain: You’re trapped in a day that repeats itself. If you die, then you go back to the morning, to repeat the day again. If you last until the end of the day, you still repeat it again. Colt must “break the loop” by efficiently murdering seven main characters, who are inconveniently are never in the same place at the same time. It’s also stylish, accessible and fun.</p><p>While you try to figure out your escape from this time anomaly, you’ll also be hunted down by Julianna, another island resident who, like you, is able to remember everything that happens in each loop. She’ll also lock you out of escaping an area, and generally interfere with your plans to escape the time loop. (The online multiplayer is also addictive, flipping the roles around. You play as Julianna, hunting down Colt and foiling his plans for murder. )</p><p>As you play through the areas again (and again) you’ll equip yourself with slabs that add supernatural powers, as well as more potent weapons and trinkets to embed into both guns and yourself. It’s through this that you’re able to customize your playstyle or equip yourself in the best way to survive Julianna and nail that assassination. Each time period and area rewards repeat exploration, with secret guns, hidden conversations with NPCs and lots of world-building lore to discover for yourself.</p><h2>Marvel’s Spider-Man Ultimate Edition</h2><p></p><p>Finally, you don't have to pick up <em>Spider-Man 2</em> on the GameCube to get your web-slinging fix anymore. For almost 15 years, that game was held as the gold standard for a Spider-Man game, and I'll let you into a secret: It wasn't actually that good. <em>Marvel's Spider-Man</em>, on the other hand, is a tour de force. Featuring the best representation of what it's like to swing through New York City, well, ever, Insomniac's PlayStation exclusive also borrows liberally from the Batman: Arkham series' combat and throws in a story that, although it takes a while to get going, ends up in a jaw-dropping place.</p><p>With the launch of the PS5, Insomniac released a <em>Miles Morales</em> spin-off game, which follows the eponymous character as he attempts to protect NYC in Peter Parker’s absence.

With the full graphical package enabled, you’ll be playing at 30 frames per second in 4K, or you can pick between a pair of performance options: 4K/60 with no ray tracing, or 1080p/60 with ray-tracing. Whatever mode you pick, you’ll benefit from loading times that finally make the game’s fast travel system… fast.</p><h2>Resident Evil Village</h2><p></p><p><a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9SZXNpZGVudC1FdmlsLVZpbGxhZ2UtUGxheVN0YXRpb24tNS1TdGFuZGFyZC9kcC9CMDhUWUNXSzNDP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWR4LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0NTJkNjcyOS1mMTM2LTQ3NWMtOWJjNS01OGY4ZTBlYmNjNjQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQz8NecIvyAf97jSKuf5lrxEomIxgG0K7P9VWXZSN8vw&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FResident-Evil-Village-PlayStation-5-Standard%2Fdp%2FB08TYCWK3C"><em>Resident Evil Village</em></a> is delightful. It’s a gothic fairy tale masquerading as a survival-horror game, and while this represents a fresh vibe for the franchise, it’s not an unwelcome evolution. The characters and enemies in Village are full of life — even when they’re decidedly undead — and Capcom has put a delicious twist on the idea of vampires, werewolves, sea creatures, giants and creepy dolls. The game retains its horror, puzzle and action roots, and it has Umbrella Corporation’s fingerprints all over it. On PS5, the game is gorgeous and it plays nicely with the DualSense controller, adding haptic feedback to weapons and terrifying situations alike. It simply feels like developers had fun with this one, and so will you.</p><h2>Returnal</h2><p></p><p><a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ffe106af-8248-4af3-9098-a2d4fd637766&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GameStop&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmZmUxMDZhZi04MjQ4LTRhZjMtOTA5OC1hMmQ0ZmQ2Mzc3NjYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2FtZXN0b3AuY29tL3ZpZGVvLWdhbWVzL3BsYXlzdGF0aW9uLTUvcHJvZHVjdHMvcmV0dXJuYWwtLS1wbGF5c3RhdGlvbi01LzIzNDQ3MC5odG1sPyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNDUyZDY3MjktZjEzNi00NzVjLTliYzUtNThmOGUwZWJjYzY0In0&amp;signature=AQAAAWI7_GcIaDdBnnDldmNe2DdpbqbQGbJSWgylHqHYXAW7&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fproducts%2Freturnal---playstation-5%2F234470.html%3F"><em>Returnal</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>is a third-person action game, a roguelite, a bullet-hell shooter and very hard, perhaps not in that order. The setup is basically that you’re stuck in a death loop, but you’re aware of it, and must learn the patterns and weaknesses of enemies — and master your own — in order to progress. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/returnal-review-ps5-shooter-133029657.html">As <em>Devindra Hardwar </em>explains</a>, it leans heavily on the dark sci-fi of <em>Alien</em>,<em> Edge of Tomorrow</em> and <em>Event Horizon</em> but makes something new and unique in the process.</p><p>It’s made by the team behind <em>Resogun</em>,<em> Nex Machina</em> and <em>Super Stardust HD</em>, and you can tell, for better or worse. As you’d expect from a team that’s spent the past decades making shooters, the movement, gunplay and enemy attack patterns are incredibly well tuned. But on the flipside, from a studio used to smaller productions, the complexity and ambition of <em>Returnal</em> leads to a lack of polish that some may find unacceptable in a $70 game. If you can look past that, there’s a hell of a game waiting for you here.</p><h2>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</h2><p></p><p><a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TZWtpcm8tU2hhZG93cy1EaWUtVHdpY2UtUGxheVN0YXRpb24tNC9kcC9CMDdESldCWUpOP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWR4LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0NTJkNjcyOS1mMTM2LTQ3NWMtOWJjNS01OGY4ZTBlYmNjNjQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAc4Vutg-7Mctuq7keOO2Sls8TJLTnhYALM99CdquyMiL&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSekiro-Shadows-Die-Twice-PlayStation-4%2Fdp%2FB07DJWBYJN"><em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em></a> isn't just another Dark Souls game. FromSoftware's samurai adventure is a departure from that well-established formula, replacing slow, weighty combat and gothic despair for stealth, grappling hooks and swift swordplay. Oh, and while it's still a difficult game, it's a lot more accessible than Souls games — you can even pause it! The result of all these changes is something that's still instantly recognizable as a FromSoftware title, but it's its own thing, and it's very good. While the game has yet to receive a proper PS5 upgrade, the extra grunt of Sony’s next-gen console does allow the game to finally run at a locked 60fps — something the PS4 Pro couldn’t handle.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-games-for-ps5-playstation-5-171511880.html?src=rss

<p>Taking a screenshot comes in handy for multiple reasons, which is why it’s so easy to do on several devices, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-macbook-140032524.html">Macs</a>. When it comes to saving what's on your display, the answer lies in your keyboard. All you need to remember are a few keyboard shortcuts and you’ll be able to take a screenshot on Mac easily — and there are even ways to save only portions of your display and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-screen-record-on-iphone-123016561.html">screen record</a>, too. Here are all of the ways to take a screenshot on a MacBook or Mac desktop.</p><h2>How to take a screenshot of your entire screen</h2><p>If you just want a screenshot of your entire screen, just press: Command (⌘), Shift and 3. By default, that image will appear on your desktop for easy access.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="How to take a screenshot on a Mac" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/ec8479e0-351e-11ee-afef-a641eb832293" style="height: 900px; width: 1600px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Julia Mercado / Engadget</div></figure><h2>How to capture a portion of your screen</h2><p>If you want to save a portion of your screen, hit Command + Shift + 4.

A camera icon will appear and the window will turn gray to show it’s selected. Click on the screen and you will get an image of the window you chose. (Select option (⌥) in order to get rid of any border edges.)</p><h2>How to customize your screenshot experience</h2><p>If you can’t remember the keys to screenshot an entire window or a certain portion, Macs have an even easier way to screenshot. Press Command + Shift + 5 to bring up the toolbar (or simply open the screenshot tool from Spotlight).</p><figure><img alt="How to take a screenshot on a Mac" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/1ff12620-351f-11ee-bfdb-bd2d977df68b" style="height: 879px; width: 1164px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Julia Mercado / Engadget</div></figure><p>This will give you several options, such as taking screenshots of videos and even recording the screen.

<p>Here’s a series of words that’ll send any sane person sighing themselves into oblivion, sorry in advance. Elon Musk has announced he may need to postpone his potential brawl with Mark Zuckerberg over a medical issue. The Xitter owner Xeeted he <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-says-he-might-need-surgery-before-any-cage-fight-with-mark-zuckerberg-154237731.html"><ins>needs to get an MRI of his neck and upper back,</ins></a> which may lead to surgery before any date is set in stone.</p><p>Plenty of folks are hinting Musk’s medical issue may be as conveniently timed as Frasier Crane’s clarinet lesson. And this wouldn’t be the first time Musk has talked a good game and then spent the next few months doing his best to avoid following through. After all, that’s how he wound up owning Xitter in the first place – and look how well <em>that’s </em>gone.</p><p>I don’t know what’s worse: That billionaire CEOs are making lame jokes about punch-fighting one another or that some people are taking this stuff seriously. Or that this weird mix of idiotic bravura and unrestrained id means, in this increasingly dumb world, there’s a tiny but real chance it might actually go ahead.</p><p>– Dan Cooper</p><p><em>You can get these reports delivered daily, direct to your inbox. </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em><ins>Subscribe right here!</ins></em></a>​​​​</p><h3>The biggest stories you might have missed</h3><h3></h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-next-call-of-duty-game-is-modern-warfare-iii-165748261.html"><ins>The next Call of Duty game is Modern Warfare III </ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-power-bank-143048526.html"><ins>The best power banks for 2023</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-original-red-dead-redemption-is-coming-to-ps4-and-switch-165058354.html"><ins>The original Red Dead Redemption is coming to PS4 and Switch </ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-laptops-for-students-130054631.html"><ins>The best laptops for college students</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/scientists-have-reproduced-last-years-nuclear-fusion-breakthrough-200611282.html"><ins>Scientists have reproduced last year's nuclear fusion breakthrough</ins></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/mrbeasts-burger-company-countersues-the-youtube-megastar-for-over-100-million-183859754.html"><ins>MrBeast's burger company countersues the YouTube megastar for over $100 million</ins></a></h2><h3>The pair should obviously resolve their dispute with a cage match.</h3><p></p><p>YouTube star MrBeast teamed up with Virtual Dining Concepts (VDC), a ghost kitchen operator, to produce MrBeast-branded burgers.

## PayPal introduces its own stablecoin that's pegged to the US dollar

<p>Almost three years after PayPal <a href="https://www.engadget.com/paypal-opens-cryptocurrency-all-us-accounts-210541778.html">started supporting cryptocurrency</a> for all US accounts, the fintech company has <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2023-08-07-PayPal-Launches-U-S-Dollar-Stablecoin">launched its own stablecoin</a> that's pegged to the US dollar. PayPal USD, the payment processor said, is &quot;100 percent backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries and similar cash equivalents.&quot; The company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/paypal-confirms-stablecoin-110106632.html">first confirmed</a> that it was &quot;exploring a stablecoin&quot; back in January last year after a developer found code and images for a &quot;PayPal Coin&quot; in its app. It said back then that it will work with relevant regulators &quot;if and when [it] seek[s] to move forward.&quot;</p><p>In its announcement, PayPal explained that its coin is a token issued on the Ethereum blockchain by the Paxos Trust Company, which is subject to the regulatory oversight of the New York State Department of Financial Services. The company also obtained a BitLicense, or a business license of virtual currency activities, from the NYDFS in June 2022.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Users can buy and sell PayPal USD coins for $1 each. They can send the coins to other users as payment or use them to purchase goods and services by selecting the option during the checkout process. They can also transfer PayPal USD to compatible external wallets or convert other cryptocurrencies in their account to and from the stablecoin.&nbsp;</p><p>As <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/paypal-launches-stablecoin-crypto-push-2023-08-07/"><em>Reuters</em></a> notes, authorities previously thwarted attempts by major companies to introduce stablecoins of their own. Meta, for instance, spent two years trying to launch a stablecoin, but the project <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-backed-diem-association-sale-234147500.html">collapsed</a> after repeated delays due to regulators' concerns that it could be used for money laundering and other nefarious purposes. Ian Katz, managing director of Capital Alpha Partners, told <em>Reuters</em> that PayPal USD could soon attract the attention of the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission. For now, PayPal is focusing on rolling out the new currency and all the things people can do with it in the US.</p><div id="c5245c28457a4a3cb2082f2323fb6112"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/paypal-introduces-its-own-stablecoin-thats-pegged-to-the-us-dollar-091019012.html?src=rss

## NASA regains contact with Voyager 2 after it went dark for two weeks

<p>NASA has <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasa-mission-update-voyager-2-communications-pause">reestablished</a> connection with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-29-nasa-fixing-voyager-2-problem.html">Voyager 2</a> after a tense two weeks of not hearing anything from the probe. On July 21st, the agency lost contact with Voyager 2 following a series of planned commands that mistakenly pointed it two degrees away from our planet. While it is scheduled to automatically reset its orientation on October 15th, it's not surprising that NASA scientists didn't just wait for that date to know whether the spacecraft is still running. Voyager 2 was launched way back in 1977, and it's one of the only two probes sending us back valuable data on interstellar space.&nbsp;</p><p>For a few days after July 21st, NASA wasn't even sure what the spacecraft's condition was. It wasn't until August 1st that multiple ground antennas from the Deep Space Network (DSN) were able to detect a carrier signal from the probe. A carrier signal is what a spacecraft uses to beam data back to the ground, but NASA said the one DSN detected was too weak to be able to transmit any information. Still, it was enough to confirm that Voyager 2 was still working and that it hadn't deviated from its trajectory.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Instead of simply waiting for October, Voyager's ground team decided to take action. They concocted a plan to &quot;shout&quot; a command to the spacecraft across over 12.3 billion miles of space using the DSN, telling it to turn its antenna back to Earth. The whole process illustrated just how vast outer space truly is: It took 18.5 hours for that message to reach the probe, and another 18.5 hours for NASA to start receiving science and telemetry data again, indicating that Voyager 2 had received the command.&nbsp;</p><p>This isn't the first time NASA has had issues with the spacecraft. In 2020, it had to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-29-nasa-fixing-voyager-2-problem.html">provide tech assistance</a> from billions of miles away after it tripped a system that shut off its scientific gear to conserve electricity. Voyager 2 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-10-nasa-voyager-2-entered-interstellar-space.html">entered interstellar space</a> — that means it exited the plasma bubble created by our sun — back in 2018, becoming the second human-made object to do so after Voyager 1. Although NASA believes that both Voyager 1 and 2 could remain in contact with the DSN until 2036, it also <a href="https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/frequently-asked-questions/#:~:text=The%20two%20Voyager%20spacecraft%20could,Voyager%201%20and%202%20today%3F">says</a> that &quot;science data won't likely be collected after 2025.&quot; The spacecraft could only be providing us information on interstellar space for less than two years, so it stands to reason that scientists don't want to waste a single day it can send data back to Earth.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/nasa-regains-contact-with-voyager-2-after-it-went-dark-for-two-weeks-074447578.html?src=rss

## Apple Music will help you find new songs and artists with Discovery Station

<p>Apple has quietly launched a new feature for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-100-million-songs-175703163.html">music streaming service</a> that could help you expand your playlists and find new artists to listen to. It's a personalized radio station called &quot;Discovery Station,&quot; which picks the songs it thinks you'd be into from Apple Music's catalog. As <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/08/07/apple-music-debuts-new-algorithmic-discovery-station-radio"><em>Apple Insider</em></a> notes, the tech giant's music service hasn't gone all in on algorithmic recommendations like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotifys-niche-mixes-let-you-generate-personalized-playlists-for-almost-anything-220006705.html">Spotify</a>, which has several playlists that can generate mixes based on your listening habits.&nbsp;</p><p>An Apple spokesperson told us that Discovery Station will only play music you haven't played on the service before from both familiar artists and potentially unfamiliar ones it thinks you might like. And since its main purpose is to help you discover new music, it will never play the same song twice and will play continuously until you stop it. Like other playlists that use algorithms to recommend tracks, Discovery Station also bases its suggestions on your activity and will keep changing as your taste evolves.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The feature is now live around the world. If you're an existing subscriber, you can access it by going to your  Listen Now page and checking out the Stations for You section. If you don't have a subscription, it will cost you at least $5 a month in the US for an audio-only plan or at least $11 a month if you want access to Apple Music's video programming and other features, such as lossless audio and Dolby Atmos.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-will-help-you-find-new-songs-and-artists-with-discovery-station-051205049.html?src=rss
