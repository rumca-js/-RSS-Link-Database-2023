Did you know Sega made gaming PCs? Well, they do, they're modern, and they have been building machines like this for well over a decade. But there's more to the story than just that! Did you know these PCs are used in arcades, run Windows, and have always on DRM that makes Denuvo look like child's play, and it has lead to clandestine networks of arcade operators outside of the games' native regions? How does it work? What caveats are there? Will this be your next sick rig?
