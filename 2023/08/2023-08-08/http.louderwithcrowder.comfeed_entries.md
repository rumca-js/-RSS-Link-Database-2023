HINT: It rhymes with Schmemocrats. Some point to how <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/san-francisco-walgreens-shoplifter" target="_blank">city councils have legalized stealing</a>. Idiots think there is a correlation <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/aoc-stop-buillding-jails" target="_blank">between crime and the number of jails we build</a>. Joe Biden said yesterday crime is on the rise because there are too many guns. Whether or not Joe Biden knew where he was when he said that is open for debate. I can, however, think of one person who was happy he had a gun and how said firearm allowed him to prevent a crime.</p><p>It's this guy. And this video is NSFW.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p><em>"It's a stick. Can you even drive a stick?"</em></p><p>That was the only bit of dialogue I'm allowed to transcribe.</p><p>The video is actually from 2022, but it getting a fresh look on the viral X (formerly Twitter) thanks to CCTV IDIOTS. In under six hours it;s already gotten over a million views.</p><p>I'd also like to point something else out. The leftists who push the policies that are causing the rise in crime also have a weird fantasy that cops go out looking for excuses to shoot people if those people have a particular complexion. Notice no one got shot here. The man holding the gun sounded like he was on the phone with dispatch. Cops were polite to him. He was polite to cops. The guy who tried jacking the wrong car was taken away. This is how 99.86% of police interactions go. Just saying.</p><p>The hero here is of course the Second Amendment advocate. For stopping the carjacking. And more importantly, for having the instinct to record the interaction for the entertainment of a grateful internet.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Marine who survived Kabul attacks dishes on insulting meeting with Joe Biden: “I don’t have an arm”

Bush would meet with family members of fallen soldiers and do nothing but listen to them, even if they were screaming at him. That seems so much more dignified than a president going up to families whose servicemember sons and daughters were just killed and saying, "Hey, I have a dead son too." Or in the case of Sgt. Tyler Vargas-Andrews, asking the shake his hand... that had just gotten blown off in Kabul.</p><p>Vargas-Andrew received the same prepared comments that the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/gold-star-mother-biden" target="_blank">Gold Star families all received from the president</a>. Nothing about them. Everything about Joe. And this was the PRE-PREPARED response.</p><p>"I remember him coming up to me trying to shake my hand, trying to shake my right hand. I look at him, and I’m like, 'I don’t have an arm.' My left arm is in this big ass cast with this giant orange f*cking foam block around it. I’m completely immobile, all I can do is move my hand, and he says “Oh” and like kind of stands up and goes over to reach for my fingers because about an inch of my fingers are showing."</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Vargas-Andrews' mom, who was already angry at Biden, lit into him when Joe asked the Marine -- who was lying in bed without an arm after the Kabul attack. that only happened due to Biden's incompetent Afghanistan withdrawal -- "What do you want?" The Marine, who just saw his buddies blown away, said that he just wanted to be himself. Biden asked, "Huh?"</p><p>The furious mother responded: “He said he just wants to be himself. He just wants to be him. He said he just wants to be me.”</p><p>No apology. No show of empathy. Vargas-Andrew said Biden was just going through the motions. It was insulting.</p><p>Pair this article with two others. The first is about yesterday's event in California <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/gold-star-mom-rips-biden" target="_blank">where all the Gold Star families shared similar stories</a> about how little Biden cared about their loved one's sacrifice. </p><p>The other is NBC News lamenting how Republicans <a href="https://hotair.com/ed-morrissey/2023/08/08/nbc-republicans-sure-are-pouncing-all-over-bidens-brand-or-something-n569824" target="_blank">are POUNCING on Joe Biden's brand</a>. Trying to destroy his "brand" of being a good person. It's increasingly clear Biden was never a good person. This is who he's always been. It was just easier for the media to hide it when he wasn't the president.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## So-called "academics" are attacking Jason Aldean's "Small Town," claim it's a dog whistle to Trump Country

Or, to be more precise, journalismers want to create "this is racist" content and find a professor to interview so they can claim, "Experts say, this is racist."</p><p><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/jason-aldean-cynically-built-small-173630278.html" target="_blank">Hollywood Reporter</a>, we're looking at you.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>This shows a laughable misunderstanding of country music. Another way to word this headline is "Country singer sings song that appeals to country music fans." Also, Aldean didn't build anything. He didn't write the song or direct the video.</p><p>It's not a knock on him <a href="https://www.whiskeyriff.com/2023/07/20/jake-owen-responds-to-jason-isbells-write-your-own-songs-dagger-regarding-jason-aldean-wrong-way-to-encourage-artists/" target="_blank">or a Jason Isbell thing</a>. It's how Nashville works. Some artists write their own songs. Other artists team with the city's wealth of songwriters. Aldean "cynically built" the song by listening to a demo and saying, "Hey, this song slaps. I want to record it."</p><p>THR's excuse <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/academics-claim-aldeans-try-small-town-coded-language-appeal-trump-country?intcmp=tw_fnc" target="_blank">for creating this content</a> stems from two professors. Hunter College music theory professor Philip Ewell, claims the "anti-blackness" of the song while subtle, is unmistakable. Belmont University professor Don Cusic claims it used "coded language" and "coded pictures." The fact that there were plenty of white people in the riot footage as well? Meh. The producers KNEW what they were doing anyway. "People who are Trump supporters are looking at it a lot differently than intelligentsia."</p><p>My favorite is when they analyze the line about pulling a gun on the liquor store owner: "Someone’s robbing a liquor store — in the American psyche, the person who’s doing that without saying it is a Black person, right? It’s just in our minds. The owner of a liquor store is probably Asian or maybe white."</p><p>If whenever you hear of <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/man-robs-target-ankle-monitor" target="_blank">a liquor store being robbed</a> you think <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elderly-store-owner-opens-fire-on-would-be-robber" target="_blank">of a black person</a>, that's on you. But this is Joe Biden's America.

<p>Leftists want to create evil motives for why the songwriters -- Kelley Lovelace, Neil Thrasher, Tully Kennedy, and Kurt Allison -- wrote the song. In reality, this is most likely how the song came about:</p><p>Kelley Lovelace: What do you guys want to write about today?</p><p>Neil Thrasher: How about how terrible cities are and how in small towns, we look out for each other?</p><p>Tully Kennedy: Great. I have a guitar lick I've been working on. Anyone want a Bud Light?</p><p>Kurt Allison: LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL!

## NBC News lies their face off to DeSantis on Democrats' abortion extremism, even though there are receipts

	It is a day ending in "Y," so of course, either a Democrat or someone in the media (but I repeat myself) is lying about how <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nikki-haley-cnn-abortion" target="_blank">extreme Democrats are on abortion</a>. Yesterday's version took the form of an NBC News interview between Dasha Burns and Republican Presidential Candidate Ron DeSantis.
</p><p>
	The Left has signaled they are going to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kamala-harris-most-americans" target="_blank">make abortion the main part of their campaign</a> (other than screwing your daughters out of athletic opportunities). It makes perfect sense for them to do so <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/democrats-and-republicans-arent-divided-by-gender-theyre-divided-by-marriage" target="_blank">since unmarried women are singlehandedly keeping the party afloat</a>. DeSantis made the factually accurate comment that Democrats support abortion until birth and Burns had to push back on that for some reason.

<p>DeSantis was all like, "I would not allow what a lot of the left wants to do, which is to override pro-life protections throughout the country all the way up really until the moment of birth in some instances, which I think is infanticide."</p><p>Then Burns was all like, "Well, actually, I gotta push back on that because that’s a misrepresentation of what’s happening.

But the talking point is that Democrats don't want any restrictions on abortions, even as Burns claims "There’s no indication of Democrats pushing for that."</p><p>Unless you consider all the evidence of Democrats pushing for that.</p><p>Maine Democratic Gov.

<p>None of us should be surprised that the Democrats' 2024 campaign is going to be focused on a) abortion, b) Trump, and c) lying about abortion. We need to be prepared to counter their attacks. And by "their," that means Democrats AND the media. But again, I repeat myself.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

When the family of Lance Corporal Rylee McCollum, his family made the trip but did not want to meet the man they blamed for their son being killed.

(<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RUM" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NASDAQ: RUM</a>), the popular video-sharing platform, announced today that top political commentator and conservative comedian Steven Crowder has surpassed $7.5 million in subscription payments to his ‘MugClub’ community since launching his show on Rumble in March 2023 with a promotion for the three-month free subscription. Rumble recognizes subscription revenue proportionally over the respective subscription term. Because most Mug Club subscriptions are annual, the full $7.5 million will not be recognized as revenue in Rumble’s financial statements at the time the funds are collected. </p><p>Rumble is excited to work with Steven Crowder and his crew through infrastructure and business model developments to widen the ‘MugClub’ umbrella and make the community the first full-fledged, truly independent news and entertainment network in alignment with the free speech ideals that drive Rumble’s mission.</p><p>“Steven Crowder is one of the most popular hosts in the world, so it’s no surprise that he continues to play a pivotal role in a foundational year for Rumble,” said Rumble Chairman and CEO Chris Pavlovski. “We’re excited to see how Steven expands his network and celebrate his continued success on our platforms, where he is truly free to express himself,” he added.</p><p>“We at ‘MugClub’ are thrilled to be brothers-in-arms with the dedicated folks at Rumble in the war against cancel culture and the fight for free speech,” said Crowder. “‘MugClub’ is the place for replatforming, and we will not stop until everyone has a voice. We are doubling down and reinvesting in ‘MugClub.’ There are big changes coming and the ‘MugClub’ army is about to be all gas, no brake.”</p><p>Along with his free show, ‘Louder with Crowder,’ airing on Rumble weekdays at 10 a.m. ET, Crowder’s paying ‘MugClub’ subscribers receive access to exclusive content and daily live question and answer sessions, in addition to other live events, comedy specials, and content from an expanding roster of high-profile commentators and comedians. ‘Mug Club’ subscribers will soon receive additional benefits, including access to even more content from well-known affiliated creators, as the network grows and Rumble continues to add product features.</p><p>You can subscribe to Steven Crowder’s Rumble page at <a href="https://rumble.com/c/StevenCrowder" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rumble.com/StevenCrowder</a>. </p><p>You can join Steven Crowder’s Mug Club community at <a href="https://mugclub.rumble.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mugclub.rumble.com</a>. </p><p>ABOUT RUMBLE</p><p>Rumble is a high-growth video platform that is creating the rails and independent infrastructure designed to be immune to cancel culture.
