## Drew Michael: Drew’s Adventures review – SNL writer’s spiky and serious comedy

<p><strong>Pleasance Dome, Edinburgh<br /></strong>The polarising comic overthinks relationships and family ties before leading his audience into territory where he’s not after laughs</p><p>Drew Michael’s first televised set was called “the most polarising comedy special of the year” and its follow-up likewise divided audiences. The impression of less of a crowd-pleaser than a crowd-provoker is confirmed by his fringe debut, an inventive and intimate set that Michael interrupts with staged phone-calls from the audience, protesting against the show’s self-indulgence and lack of easy hooks. I wouldn’t go that far, but the 37-year-old is stronger on structure and invention than on jokes, which absent themselves entirely as the show narrows to its heartfelt conclusion.</p><p>It is not clear that’s where we are heading when the sometime <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/saturday-night-live">Saturday Night Live</a> writer kicks off, with an act-out fretting about whether last night’s date will respond to his texts. It establishes him as an intense overthinker, his vulnerabilities uncomfortably close to the surface. We then flash back to a slanging match between Michael’s parents, who then break out of their frame and begin commentating on his show. These same parents are implicated in Michael’s failure to address his hearing loss as a child, which has since severely deteriorated, as an upstage graph dolefully depicts.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/08/drew-michael-review-pleasance-dome-edinburgh">Continue reading...</a>

## Ultimate Wedding Planner review – nothing is good or real in the world any more

<p>This pointless, trashy slog of a series sees wannabe organisers of nuptials badly struggle to run couples’ big days – judged by Fred Siriex. It’s so irritating it will make you need a lie down</p><p>I’m afraid that, coming as hard as it does on the heels of the festival of stupidity that is the UK edition of Alone, the advent of Ultimate Wedding Planner on our screens forces me to renew my call for all broadcasters’ charters to be amended. From now on, all channels must include at least three shows every year showcasing and celebrating people’s real skills and genuine talents – rather than chucking them into situations in which they’re set up to fail. Hopefully this cross-platform Basic Competence series will keep us all from throwing ourselves at the nearest wall until we fall into the sweet relief of unconsciousness.</p><p>You can probably guess what Ultimate Wedding Planner is like. There are three judges; Fred Sirieix, best known for his soothingly charmant presence as maitre d’hotel in Channel 4’s First Dates; Sara Davies, founder of supply company Crafter’s Companion and Dragons’ Den dragon since 2019; and Raj Somaiya, the CEO of Silverfox Events, a company that specialises in organising high-end weddings. And, while it feels like there are 700 contestants, my notes assure me there are only eight. All of whom have been operating on the fringes of the wedding planning business but now want to break into the industry proper.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/aug/08/ultimate-wedding-planner-review-nothing-is-good-or-real-in-the-world-any-more">Continue reading...</a>

<p>While a country of 250 million people grapples with multiple crises, the political struggle over Imran Khan’s future continues</p><p>The multiple crises facing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/pakistan" title="">Pakistan</a> are not merely daunting, but immense. Six million more people have been <a href="https://www.islamic-relief.org.uk/one-year-since-pakistan-floods-climate-justice-is-urgently-needed/" title="">plunged into poverty</a> since the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/aug/05/a-year-on-the-devastating-long-term-effects-of-pakistans-floods-are-revealed" title="">devastating floods</a> inundated a third of the country last year; around two in five children in affected areas are suffering stunted growth due to malnutrition. The International Monetary Fund <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-66172159" title="">finally approved a $3bn bailout</a> last month, but the economy is still reeling. Attacks by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan and other militants <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/30/pakistan-explosion-political-event-khyber-pakhtunkhwa-province" title="">have surged</a> in the north-west. Amid all this, the outgoing government of Shehbaz Sharif has prioritised a new census and the redrawing of constituency boundaries.</p><p>The real reason is to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/06/fears-grow-pakistani-government-will-delay-general-election-due-this-year" title="">delay the general election</a> that was due later this year. The purpose was made pretty plain by the fact that it was announced on the same day that the former prime minister <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/imran-khan" title="">Imran Khan</a> was arrested after a court <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/05/former-pakistan-prime-minister-imran-khan-jailed-for-three-years" title="">sentenced him to three years in prison</a> on corruption charges and barred him from politics for five years. The precise details of the case are less significant than the fact that it is only one of well over 100 that he faces. The media <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/21/imran-khan-pakistan-tv-prime-minister-army" title="">has been silenced</a>: broadcasters are unable to mention his name. And parliament has just pushed through more than 50 bills in just two days – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/02/pakistan-government-faces-backlash-over-draconian-arrest-powers" title="">handing draconian powers</a> to its feared military intelligence agency. As one seasoned Pakistani observer <a href="https://www.arabnews.pk/node/2350896" title="">has noted</a>, removing Mr Khan from electoral politics is not the same as removing him from the political scene. But the army and rival civilian politicians are doing their best to achieve the latter together.</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

## The Guardian view on language apps: a reminder that millions aspire to be mutilingual | Editorial

<p>Computer tutors such as Duolingo may may not create polyglots, but they are a lesson to all who think language teaching is not valued</p><p>Among the evergreen jokes of the British comedy troupe Monty Python is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIAdHEwiAy8" title="">a grammar gag</a> in their 1979 film Life of Brian. Caught daubing graffiti on the walls of Pontius Pilate’s palace by a Roman centurion, the hapless wannabe activist Brian is held at daggerpoint, not for vandalism or insurrection but for getting the Latin for “Romans go home” wrong. Brian’s punishment is to write the sentence out correctly 100 times before sunrise. The joke’s appeal depends partly on its silly-ass slide from totalitarian horror into a fear of traditional language teaching, and partly on the communal sheepishness that so often accompanies Britons holidaying abroad as they try to navigate the local lingo.</p><p>Decades on, extraordinarily, the skit has lost none of its touchstones. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/nov/14/michael-gove-backs-learning-by-rote" title="">Learning by rote</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/feb/02/michael-gove-traditional-punishments-school-misbehaviour" title="">punishment by writing lines</a> have featured in Tory prescriptions for a cure to educational ills, while command of languages at school level has taken a triple hit: harder exams, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/feb/24/labour-says-government-has-created-perfect-storm-in-englands-teaching-workforce" title="">critical, resource-driven staffing crisis</a>, and a reported post-Brexit reluctance among some students – and their parents – to commit time and effort to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jul/03/brexit-putting-pupils-off-modern-foreign-languages" title="">the languages of a Europe</a> to which they no longer belong.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/08/the-guardian-view-on-language-apps-a-reminder-that-millions-aspire-to-be-mutilingual">Continue reading...</a>

Zombieverse is full of scares, shocked celebs and some TV trickery that is hilarious – unwittingly</p><p>British viewers coming cold to Zombieverse, Netflix’s new Korean “reality” series, will have a blissful few minutes where they are not sure what they are watching. Well, it’s not that blissful, or I wouldn’t be about to spoil it by explaining, but there is a moderately pleasurable period of dizzy confusion as five people meet in what seems to be the green room of a dating show. On set, the “host” explains the premise, which involves men and women meeting in a bar and immediately getting off with one another – but one of the women is behaving oddly. As our five new pals watch on a monitor, wide-eyed, this singleton starts behaving very oddly indeed, biting her date until his jugular spurts. Bloody hell.</p><p>She’s a zombie! It’s a zombie apocalypse! The five are stooges, contestants not on a dating show but in an immersive horror-reality series that elaborately convinces them they are the survivors of an outbreak of flesh-munching undead-ery in Seoul, then corrals them into various life-or-death scenarios as they scream and scheme in an effort to remain alive.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/aug/08/watch-out-for-the-flesh-eating-pensioner-zombieverse-netflixs-ludicrous-new-reality-horror">Continue reading...</a>

I was followed on social media by journalists from the Sun and the Daily Mail within minutes of each other, then soon after had a call from the Telegraph and an email from the Express. All advised that they were writing a story about me and wanted to give me a right to reply. I immediately thought this to be a government-inspired hit job because of my work supporting victims of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/20/tuesday-briefing-first-edition-windrush-scandal-home-office">Windrush scandal</a>. I didn’t imagine it could be anything else. Two of the journalists explained that they’d been sent a dossier about me from Conservative party HQ, which had either deliberately or inadvertently been attached to an email.</p><p>I thought back to examples of thing kind of thing in history, such as the horrors of McCarthyism, or the practices of eastern European intelligence units in the Soviet era. It was hard to fathom that someone like me – who lives for work, and who climbed mountains to become a lawyer, including giving birth on the day of an exam – could attract such ire. To my surprise, there was no mention of my Windrush cases at all – these have accounted for 90% of my work in the past five years. Windrush was a scandal created by the Conservative government, but one that it has profusely apologised for, and has promised to make amends for via a compensation scheme and other measures.</p><p>Jacqueline McKenzie is a partner and head of immigration and asylum law at Leigh Day</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Meet the novelists subverting the cliches</p><p>You’ve probably come across this woman: she is unfulfilled in her career, has been abandoned by at least one man, she is aimless and lamenting the obstacles in her life (of which, in reality, there don’t appear to be many). She is not just miserable, she’s a mess; self-absorbed and full of self-loathing.</p><p>If you’ve read a book by a woman, about a woman, that has been published in the last five years, then it’s overwhelmingly likely that this woman was the protagonist. The narrative likely circled around this character’s sadness, her passive struggle to overcome it, and little else. Typically, such stories have notes of darkness but will rarely deliver the actual thing. Usually the main character (like the author) will be middle-class, if not incredibly wealthy. Almost always she will be white. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/05/well-dressed-and-distressed-why-sad-young-women-are-the-latest-book-cover-trend">book’s cover will probably feature a devastated-looking woman</a> with her hair covering her face or her head cradled in her hands.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/08/a-smorgasbord-of-unlikability-the-authors-helping-sad-girl-lit-grow-up">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Like a naughty Siri’: friendly sex robot Vanessa 5000 asks audiences to test her powers

<p>In her Edinburgh festival show, LA comic and clown Courtney Pauroso plays a latex-clad humanoid pleasure device. But are fringegoers ready to restart her?</p><p>The last time I saw Courtney Pauroso, she was upside down, legs splayed, doing a naked, spotlit handstand. “My father saw that show,” the LA clown winces. “I just told my mum: when the lights go out, tell Dad to close his eyes.” With extreme physical abandon, Pauroso’s solo performances shift sharply from wide-eyed innocence to grotesque, knockout humour. Does she enjoy making people feel uncomfortable? “Yeah,” she laughs, “I’m OK with that.”</p><p>Far from the world of red-nosed children’s entertainers, Pauroso found her way to clowning through sketch comedy. As a kid she would watch <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/dec/10/best-of-i-love-lucy-box-set-review-lucille-ball">I Love Lucy</a> reruns with her grandma, harbouring dreams of becoming a serious actor. But over time she found a different level of performance she was more aligned to: “this natural stupidity that I bring to the table.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/08/sex-robot-courtney-pauroso-vanessa-5000-edinburgh-fringe">Continue reading...</a>

But with the success of Oppenheimer, now’s the time to consider trying Manhattan – but go in knowing you should not expect to learn the ins and outs of nuclear fission or second world war geopolitics with any robust fidelity. Manhattan is a (very) fictionalised telling of the drama, secrecy and breakthroughs of the Los Alamos nuclear bomb project.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/aug/09/tv-series-like-oppenheimer-manhattan-where-to-watch-stan">Continue reading...</a>

## Gran Turismo review – gamer turns racer in super-bland ode to product placement

<p>Rather than embrace the video-game that inspired it, the film is a simulation of cinema featuring a reliably underwhelming cameo from Geri Halliwell Horner</p><p>Product placement has rarely been as chronic or concussive as it is in Gran Turismo, inspired by the real-life experiences of British teenager <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/apr/29/jann-ardenborough-racing-car-games">Jann Mardenborough</a> (played here by the sweetly gauche Archie Madekwe), whose PlayStation proficiency won him the chance to compete as a real-life racing driver in GT Academy, a Nissan-sponsored promotion intended to get the public loving cars again. Before you can say “Ulez”, he is taking private jets and eating sushi (“This is amazing!”) while glamorous destinations flash by on screen: Tokyo! Dubai! Cardiff!</p><p>The contest is the brainchild of Nissan executive Danny Moore (Orlando Bloom), who dreams of turning gamers into racers; Moore, though, comes on like a dullard Willy Wonka as he whittles down the candidates. Thank goodness for David Harbour as Jack Salter, a grizzled trainer who delivers an anti-pep talk telling the bushy tailed gamers that they’re doomed to failure. He could almost be addressing Jason Hall (American Sniper) and Zach Baylin (King Richard), the co-writers of the chicane-free script, or director Neill Blomkamp, who made the complex alien allegory <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/sep/03/district-9-review">District 9</a> but has trouble animating the simplest exchanges here. Then again, perhaps no one could have brought naturalism to Jann’s home life, where his parents are played by a baffled-looking Djimon Hounsou (“There’s no future in racing!”) and Ginger Spice, AKA Geri Halliwell Horner, who remains as compellingly unable to deliver a line as she was in her Sex and the City cameo 20 years ago.</p><p>Gran Turismo is released on 10 August in Australia, 11 August in the UK, and 25 August in the US.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/08/gran-turismo-review-gamer-turns-racer-in-super-bland-ode-to-product-placement">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Our stellar cast of culinary experts give popcorn, pizza and snack plates top billing for film-night snacking</p><ul><li>Got a culinary dilemma? Email <a href="mailto:feast@theguardian.com">feast@theguardian.com</a></li></ul><p><strong>What movie snacks can I make for my children during the </strong><strong>school </strong><strong>holidays?<br /></strong><em><strong>Helen, Stroud, Gloucestershire</strong></em><strong><br /></strong>“When it comes to kids and movies, there is no greater combination than chocolate and popcorn,” says chef and restaurateur <a href="https://tomkerridge.com/">Tom Kerridge</a>, who is also behind the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fulltimemeals/?hl=en">Full Time Meals</a> campaign against child hunger in the UK. And those two heavyweights unite in his “amazing chocolate popcorn bars”, which can handily be made up to a week ahead and kept in the fridge, so are “perfect for impromptu movie nights with the kids inviting friends over at the last minute”. Dark chocolate is non-negotiable here – “and at least 70% cocoa,” Kerridge says – and you’ll also need some puffed rice cereal, salted popcorn, dried cranberries (“for a bit of chew”), and quartered large marshmallows. “Simply melt the chocolate, add all the other ingredients, then pour into a lined tray and pop in the fridge for two hours – it’s that easy,” Kerridge says. “Once set, cut into bars and I guarantee they’ll probably be eaten before the film starts.”</p><p>Popcorn is also the snack of choice round <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mexicanfoodmemories/?hl=en">Karla Zazueta</a>’s house. The writer and cookery teacher, who blogs at <a href="https://mexicanfoodmemories.co.uk/author/mexicanfoodmemories/">Mexican Food Memories</a>, has a weekly movie night with her family, and the key to success is to keep things customisable: “My husband is really good at making popcorn, with a little bit of butter and salt,” she says. This gets tipped into a big bowl, with everyone helping themselves to handfuls and topping however they see fit. “I like <a href="https://www.salsavalentina.com/">Valentina</a>, the Mexican hot sauce, my daughter adds sriracha, and my son, who is not that good with spicy foods, has butter.

<p>Everything the mainstream debate shrinks from, O’Connor put front and centre. Her unmitigated candour made a difference </p><p>In March 2016, Sinéad O’Connor, who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/26/sinead-oconnor-dies-aged-56">died last month at 56</a> and whose <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/06/sinead-oconnor-tribute-appears-in-ireland-as-funeral-plans-announced">funeral takes place</a> today in Bray, Ireland, went missing. I remember this specifically because the Telegraph ran a <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/16/sinead-oconnor-missing-near-chicago-believed-to-be-suicidal/">live blog</a> on the singer’s whereabouts after she had posted suicidal thoughts. <em>A live blog. </em><a href="https://twitter.com/ladyhaja/status/732330770027679744">I pointed out</a> to an editor at the paper that rolling updates about a person going through a severe mental health episode, an episode that might have ended fatally – and for all they knew, already had – was neither responsible nor compassionate. It was, coincidentally, <a href="https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/our-work/public-engagement/mental-health-awareness-week">Mental Health Awareness Week</a>.</p><p>On that occasion, O’Connor was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/16/sinead-oconnor-missing-found-safe-chicago">found safe, if not well</a>. It was not the only brutal public example of how her mental illness manifested, and <em>mental illness </em>was the blunt – accurate – term she used. Of contemporary public figures, O’Connor was perhaps the one whose experiences of psychiatric disorder – she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, and complex PTSD – spoke most to the realities of those who live with, or endure, the kind of warped brain that can make even the simplest thing feel like a Sphinx’s riddle.</p><p>Hannah Jane Parkinson is a Guardian columnist</p><p><em>In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email <a href="mailto:jo@samaritans.org">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href="mailto:jo@samaritans.ie">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

<p>Sprinter who defected after the Tokyo Olympics has built a new life in Warsaw and won the right to run for Poland at this month’s world championships </p><p>“It really feels like it was yesterday,” says Krystsina Tsimanouskaya, sipping from a glass of juice as she recalls leaving her old life behind.

It is a sweltering summer day in Warsaw and she has just sweated through an hour’s training at Stadion RKS Skra, a sprawling and largely dilapidated old venue near the city centre. “I feel really, really good in myself,” she says. The best she has ever felt as an athlete? “Uh-huh. I’ve changed a lot in my technique, in my body, my life, my food, a lot of things, and it’s really helped me.

Once we reached the point in our relationship where we were both ready </strong><strong>to have sex, she began to use vaginal dilators and, after a couple of failed attempts, we are </strong><strong>exploring penetration and enjoying the experience. </strong><strong>So far though, she </strong><strong>has been unable to climax through penetration, which is new for her. How can I </strong><strong>help</strong><strong>?</strong></p><p>Remove the pressure she feels to climax through penetration. Reversing vaginal atrophy is not easy. I applaud your joint perseverance using dilators, especially since – instead of it being a chore – you are making the task fun and erotic for both of you. But it will take more time and exploration to discover what is possible, so continue to enjoy the process and try to be accepting of the outcome – whatever it may be. Fortunately, she does not need to climax through penetration.

## From weird nostalgia to weak formats, 6 Music is having an identity crisis | Daniel Dylan Wray

<p>In trying to shake off the ‘6 Music Dad’ tag and not be thought of as an indie rock hub, the BBC radio station isn’t sure what it wants to be any more</p><p>‘The fashion event of the year is here,” announced pop artist Self Esteem in March, of a new addition to her merch store. “The <a href="https://www.musicglue.com/self-esteem/">6 Music Dad caps</a> are now available.” The 6 Music Dad character – referring to the BBC radio station – is part harmless joke, part slur. Broadly speaking, it’s aimed at people who had their formative musical years somewhere between the late 1970s and early 90s, ducked out of following music passionately while work and family life took over, and now with grownup kids, and some disposable cash to burn, dad is getting back into vinyl, lacing up the Converse and busting out the ergonomic lawn chair for festival season.</p><p>6 Music is a one-stop-shop for alternative music if you’ve no desire, or time, to search further afield. So breakthrough bands on the station – such as Wet Leg, Yard Act, and even Self Esteem – often attract a healthy following of these re-energised dads. It’s generally lighthearted ribbing, and the Self Esteem merch feels more endearing nod than cruel swipe – there is also a “6 Music Daddy” cap – but they are also often described in mocking caricatures: as balding, ale-drinking blokes solemnly nodding alongside bouncing kids.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/08/bbc-6-music-radio-station">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Both countries still believe they can prevail, and that belief is more powerful than any evidence suggesting that neither side can truly win</p><p>Initiatives aimed at ending the war that Russia started by invading Ukraine have been underway for months. On 24 February – a year to the day Russia started its attack – China unveiled <a href="https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/zxxx_662805/202302/t20230224_11030713.html">a proposal</a> containing 12 principles. In June, a group of African leaders met separately with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Russian president Vladimir Putin to present a <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/06/21/a-failed-african-peace-mission-to-ukraine-and-russia/">10-point peace plan</a>. Most recently, this month, Saudi Arabia convened <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/china-ukraine-peace-talks-russia-war-in-saudi-arabia/">more than 40 countries</a>, including Ukraine but not Russia, to find a way forward.</p><p>With the war approaching the 18-month mark, efforts like these are understandable. Parts of Ukraine have become rubble. Reconstruction costs are estimated at <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2023/03/23/updated-ukraine-recovery-and-reconstruction-needs-assessment">hundreds of billions of dollars</a>. Some 11 million Ukrainians are either <a href="https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/ukraine">refugees</a> or “<a href="https://www.migrationdataportal.org/ukraine/crisis-movements#:~:text=Internally%20Displaced%20Persons%20(IDPs),Ukraine%20(IOM%2C%202023).">internally displaced people</a>” – about a quarter of the country’s population. More than 26,000 <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/news/2023/07/ukraine-civilian-casualty-update-31-july-2023">civilians</a> have been killed or injured – some estimates run <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/10/us-estimates-200000-military-casualties-all-sides-ukraine-war">much higher</a> – and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/death-sacrifice-ukrainians-front-line-deal-loss/story?id=99068050">military casualties</a> may be four times greater.

Greed and nationalism have destroyed a great British pleasure</p><p></p><p>This ought to be a new golden age for the British seaside, since we have somehow managed to recreate the conditions of its last golden age, the late 1940s, and nobody can afford to go abroad.

Take a boat and you’ll spend most of your holiday in Dover. These are the ideal circumstances in which to rediscover the beauty of, say, Weymouth or Scarborough.</p><p>But you have to wonder how charming it would be to go to a Dorset beach when the area is mainly in the news because of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/07/first-occupants-of-bibby-stockholm-barge-taken-onboard">the Bibby Stockholm</a>, the giant refugee barge that has just taken delivery of its first residents. Even if you couldn’t see it from your beach hut – it is modestly moored in a non-beauty spot – you couldn’t help but wonder what life is like on this cramped seaborne accommodation, where the walls are bare, the hours untenanted and the TVs have no plugs. Is it at all like a cruise? Or is it more like a prison hulk?

<p>As we move towards the second anniversary of the extremists retaking power, this denial of education must be addressed </p><p>Two years of ever-intensifying repression since the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/16/taliban-declares-war-is-over-in-afghanistan-as-us-led-forces-exit-kabul">Taliban seized power</a> in August 2021 have not dimmed the resilience of girls and women in Afghanistan, who continue to risk their lives fighting for their right to an education<strong> </strong>and employment. But no one should be in any doubt that what Afghan girls are experiencing is not a temporary disruption. It is nothing less than “gender apartheid”, the chilling words used recently by the permanent representative of Afghanistan to the United Nations. Only a term as devastating as this can capture the grave violations of rights involved. It is time to declare it a crime against humanity, and the prosecutors of the international criminal court (ICC) should open an investigation into the repression ordained by the Taliban regime.</p><p>Even now, under fear of arrest, detention and torture for transgressing the Taliban’s rights-violating edicts, brave children across Afghanistan are attending underground schools. A major initiative on internet learning in universities has also recently started, with support from the refugee agency UNHCR and the consortium <a href="https://connectedlearning4refugees.org/">Connected Learning in Crisis</a>. Many families have realised that the only chance of education for their daughters is through emigration. That still leaves <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/let-girls-and-women-afghanistan-learn">an estimated 2.5 million</a> girls and young women with no education at all, and they will soon be joined by a further 3 million who are about to complete their primary education. Unable to move up to secondary school, yet another generation of Afghan girls will be denied a chance to realise their talents and fulfil their dreams.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/08/halt-taliban-repression-afghan-women-girls-education">Continue reading...</a>

It sounds counterintuitive, but in a recent study, researchers assessing 270 randomised controlled clinical trials (involving more than 15,000 participants) found that isometric exercises, in which muscles are working but remain motionless, were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/25/best-exercise-lowering-blood-pressure-planks-wall-sits-study">more effective than a range of other options for reducing blood pressure</a>.</p><p>To be clear, aerobic exercise training, dynamic resistance training, combined training and high-intensity interval training all helped, compared with non-exercise control interventions.

<p>A new Netflix documentary shows the college football great as a man unwilling – or perhaps unable – to move on from his past</p><p>Even the most casual US sports fan isn’t likely to have forgotten about Johnny Manziel, football’s Charlie Sheen. The latest instalment of Netflix’s sports documentary series Untold devotes an episode to the bad boy quarterback’s controversy-stained rise in college football, his NFL flameout and his off-field tumble into infamy and disgrace. Titled <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81582385">Untold: Johnny Football</a>, the 72-minute runtime barely covers everything, and resolves even less.</p><p>For a start, director Ryan Duffy (the Vice media alum who also co-stewarded Untold’s excellent two-part deep dive into <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/15/manti-teo-the-girlfriend-who-didnt-exist-netflix-documentary-hoax-nfl">college football cat-fishing victim Manti Te’o</a>) could have fast-forwarded through Manziel’s humble Texas small town beginnings and jumped straight to 12 November 2012: the day Manziel led Texas A&amp;M to a shock upset over the vaunted Alabama on the Crimson Tide’s hallowed home turf. That victory, the film rightly points out, didn’t just make Manziel a household name across the US. It also changed the economics at Texas A&amp;M, a military school in the Lone Star hinterlands that had recently jumped into the SEC – the top-level conference known for churning out future pros.</p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81582385">Untold: Johnny Football</a> is available on Netflix on 8 August.</p><p><em>In the UK and Ireland, <a href="https://www.samaritans.org/">Samaritans</a> can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email <a href="mailto:jo@samaritans.org">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href="mailto:jo@samaritans.ie">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

Historically, hip-hop – like the music industry at large – has had a woeful track record when it comes to celebrating and canonising the work of women, and Ladies First – named for the 1989 track by Queen Latifah and Monie Love, both of whom appear as talking heads in the series – is a joyous, painstaking attempt to establish a new historical record.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/08/ladies-first-a-story-of-women-in-hip-hop-review-a-joyous-painstaking-attempt-to-set-the-record-straight">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Cho’s collection, rich in local flavour, reflects on her feminist novel that rocked South Korean society, and generational changes for her countrywomen</p><p>Among the narrators in Cho Nam-joo’s astute short story collection, <em>Miss Kim Knows, </em>is a Seoul-based author who’s penned a #MeToo-era feminist sensation. As she confesses in Defiance: “The novel wasn’t especially progressive or radical, but it landed in the crosshairs of so many disputes,” a position that generated intense online trolling as well as enviable sales figures.</p><p>It’s an experience familiar to Cho.

<p>Optimism replaces stress over the summer and League Two clubs can draw inspiration from Carlisle and Luton</p><p>As the new football season begins (and at the risk of jeopardising my marriage) I am reminded of the early days of parenthood. From an evolutionary standpoint, it is vital to forget the challenging first few months when sleepless nights are coupled with a partner constantly looking at you with an expression somewhere between contempt and disgust.</p><p>During childbirth, there are a few illusory days of bliss when the body releases endorphins and oxytocin. Endorphins, often referred to as “feelgood” hormones, are released in response to various stimuli, including physical pain, stress and heightened emotions. Oxytocin, often called the “bonding hormone” or “love hormone”, contributes to the overall experience of childbirth and the bonding between mother and baby. These hormonal responses play a crucial role in supporting the birthing process, making the experience and pain involved more manageable. They are part of the reason why many women don’t stop having children after one child.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/08/new-football-season-hope-hugging-strangers-league-two">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Bette Gordon’s fascinating 1983 film about a woman working in an adult movie theatre has a script by Kathy Acker and parts for Nan Goldin and Spalding Gray </p><p>The 1983 indie-underground New York movie Variety, directed by Bette Gordon and scripted by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/19/sex-tattle-and-soul-how-kathy-acker-shocked-and-seduced-the-literary-world">Kathy Acker</a>, is re-released for its 40-year anniversary. It is a flawed but fascinating critique of the male gaze, the porn gaze, and the luxurious ordeal of guilty voyeurism. Gordon casts a female lead, flipping gender assumptions and turning the tables on the underworld quest-torments of Paul Schrader’s male heroes in the likes of Taxi Driver and Hardcore. Perhaps she was inspired by the mysterious inner life of the listless young woman played by Diahnne Abbott in Taxi Driver, working behind the porn-cinema concessions counter, irritated by Travis Bickle’s inquiries about what candy she has: “What you see is what we got.”</p><p>Actor and film-maker Sandy McLeod plays Christine, a demure young middle-class woman from Michigan who is desperate for money after failing to get into media or publishing in Manhattan and falling behind on her rent. Prompted by her friend Nan (played by the artist and future photography star <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/goldin">Nan Goldin</a>), she takes a job tearing tickets in a scuzzy adult movie theatre near Times Square, ironically called Variety though it offers an unvarying bill of pornography. She finds herself strangely unsettled by the movies on offer, and by the attentions of Louie (Richard M Davidson), a wealthy older man she sees there – a rather classic porn-narrative situation, in fact. Luis Guzmán plays Jose, an amiable guy who works at the cinema; Spalding Gray is the voice of a creep who leaves pervy messages on Christine’s answering machine.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/08/variety-review-fierce-feminist-porn-drama-from-the-80s-new-york-underground">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For all the talk in recent weeks of the Matildas missing Sam Kerr, another of the world’s best attackers has been playing all along</p><p>It was a perfect case study in the brilliance of Caitlin Foord. When the Matildas forward gained possession midway through the first half against Denmark night, she was deep in her own team’s half.

## Thrown review – backhold wrestling tale tackles Scottish identity

<p><strong>Traverse theatre, Edinburgh<br /></strong>Nat McCleary’s play brings five women together through a Highland Games that does not always make them welcome</p><p>Backhold wrestling, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jul/04/thrown-play-socttish-backhold-wrestling-nat-mccleary-edinburgh-festival">a folk sport that thrives in Scotland’s Highland Games</a>, brings five disparate women together in Nat McCleary’s questing debut play. It’s a pointed image for grappling with a national identity in flux, with personal identities that tussle with contradictions.<br /><br />Everyone in the wrestling team hugs their wounds and secrets. Coach Pamela is intimidatingly certain in her instruction, yet her own identity swims in doubt. Imogen, a minted Londoner (“Black first, rich second”), wants to educate Scottish-Jamaican Jo in the ways of Black sisterhood, separating her from childhood friend Chantelle. Timorous Helen is older but not yet ready for the knitting group. They may all wear the same’s tie-dyed T-shirts, but team spirit continually fractures.</p><p>I still don’t quite understand the art of backhold wrestling – it looks a bit like a grumpy cuddle. But the Highland Games are a fertile setting – a vintage image of Scottishness that sits uneasily in the modern world, as racist slurs in the three-legged race make clear. “Surely all of Scotland can’t be that white,” says Imogen (Efè Agwele) – and the cast look pointedly around the theatre audience.<br /><br />When you’re thrown, we’re told, you’re in suspension – vulnerable, questioning, “waiting for a resolution”. It’s an interesting place for drama. We also hear about wrestling’s categories and rules of engagement; the shifting middle ground in the tug of war; tartans that don’t encompass every wearer: the metaphors here write themselves, not always with nuance.<br /><br />Johnny McKnight’s tireless production, with movement direction by Lucy Glassbrook, bounces around on the balls of its feet. With 60 scenes in just 80 minutes, McCleary’s scrappy dialogue scenes often feel all too brief but her monologues pursue a thought further, and the strong cast mine nuggets of feeling whenever they get the opportunity: Adiza Shardow’s quizzical distress as Jo, the doubt behind Lesley Hart’s coaching fervour or Maureen Carr’s shy smile as Helen belatedly channels her inner bad bitch.<br /><br />Costume designer Sabrina Henry has created an original tartan for the production – a punchy weave cut with pink and yellow. Summoning a self-defined clan with ambivalent Scottish roots, it’s called, aptly, Homegrown.</p><p>At <a href="https://www.nationaltheatrescotland.com/events/thrown">Traverse theatre, Edinburgh</a>, until 27 August</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/edinburgh-festival-2023+tone/reviews">All our Edinburgh festival reviews</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/08/thrown-review-traverse-theatre-edinburgh-festival-fringe">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After last week’s surprise coup in Niger, the Russian military group Wagner is taking advantage of the chaos and anti-French sentiment, says journalist Garé Amadou in Naimey, while ordinary Nigeriens are preparing for the worst</p><p><strong>Is there real, solid support for Russia in Niger?<br /></strong>Russia’s support in Niger is limited to so-called pan-Africanist or alter-globalisation circles, mainly through social media networks. Occasionally, however, street demonstrations calling for the withdrawal of the French army from Niger are made by civil society or trade unions. During these, Russian flags are regularly waved. M62, a civil society umbrella organisation set up in 2022, is one of the leading movements surfing a wave of anti-French sentiment, along with the belief that Russian military support through <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/06/putin-wagner-africa-business-yevgeny-prigozhin-kremlin">the Wagner group</a> can help Niger in the fight against terrorism. Some members of M62 make no secret of their desire to see Niger forge relations with the paramilitary Wagner.</p><p>But the pro-Russia movement can also be found among politicians. The first, who is known for his pan-Africanist ideas and links with Russia, is Abdouramane Oumarou of the Incin Africa party. He frequently travels back and forth to Russia to meet leading figures. The second is the MPD party president, Sulhu. He was arrested on charges of colluding with a foreign power to destabilise Niger. According to our information, that power is Russia. He is said to have received a substantial sum of money to make contacts in this direction. Another group, the Umoja party, has the the same pro-Russian stance.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/aug/08/explainer-whats-behind-the-niger-coup">Continue reading...</a>

## Only Murders In the Building season three review – Meryl Streep helps make the best season ever

<p>It’s more fun, the chemistry between the amateur sleuths almost crackles, and the guests are stellar. As Streep puts in her beautiful performances, you want to punch the air</p><p>A few years ago, when naming a career-best comedy trio featuring Steve Martin and Martin Short, the presumed missing person would be their Three Amigos costar Chevy Chase. But now, as their hit show Only Murders In the Building enters its third season, Selena Gomez has firmly taken that spot. What seemed like stunt-casting when the series premiered back in 2021, or a cynical ploy to give the show cross-generation appeal, has created one of the most delightful trios on television. In the show’s best season to date, the amateur sleuths/podcasters return to solve another murder, the warm chemistry between them is even more bewitching, and the mysteries and twists are inspired. The dialogue is still silly but sharp, and it truly sings when Martin, Short and Gomez all interact to create an old-school jazzy quality. It is not the easiest narrative to sell, to convincingly keep these very different characters, who have little in common, in each other’s lives – but good news! The old gang have to get back together because, you guessed it, there was a murder, and it was in the building.</p><p>Technically, the second season of this mystery-comedy series ended on a murder. Oliver (Short) was finally back directing a play on Broadway after a notorious flop landed him “15 years in Broadway jail”. Alas, on opening night, his superstar lead Ben Glenroy (Paul Rudd), collapsed dead, seemingly ending the play, and Oliver’s career, again. Not that the success of that play felt assured, given the show’s tendency to make every element as absurd as possible. On occasion, this is something that has proven grating, but this time round the daftness of the fact that Oliver is directing “A play called Death Rattle. Set in a lighthouse in a Nova Scotia where the only witness to a murder is a baby,” never gets old. Particularly in the scenes where the self-serious actors are giving it their all in rehearsals, and Rudd’s Hollywood blowhard of a character has to brandish a rattle threateningly. Thankfully, he is given more than just a cameo and is phenomenal as a douchebag movie star who swans into rooms, makes a series of penis jokes, lets his co-star Kimber (Ashley Park) know he has “timber for Kimber” and swiftly hands out a series of NDAs. Every detail about Rudd’s Ben is hilariously terrible, from his treatment of his assistant/brother, his strong opinions on the colour palette of his dressing room, to his biggest claim to fame being the star of a series of “CoBro” films, where he plays a “bro” able to transform into a large Cobra that helps the police.</p><p>Only Murders in the Building season three is on Disney+.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/aug/08/only-murders-in-the-building-season-three-review-meryl-streep-helps-make-the-best-season-ever">Continue reading...</a>
