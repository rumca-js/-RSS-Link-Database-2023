		The New York State's IT Services Office <a href="https://its.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2023/08/biometrics-report-final-2023.pdf">released a report</a> on biometrics in schools that recommends caution before putting it in any public or private elementary and secondary school.

The report, mandated by the state legislature focuses on facial and fingerprint biometrics, and, of the two, facial recognition warrants the most concern in schools.

Fingerprint scanning is not uncommon in state schools today and present fewer risks that cannot be mitigated when compared to collecting face templates, according to the report.

Risks with face biometrics "may outweigh any documented benefits" and "there may be limitations on the ability to reduce" them.

An exception is one-to-one face matches for unlocking laptops and other hardware. This is especially useful for younger children who may struggle to use passwords.

The public survey, mostly aimed parents of school children, found that most people think the risks of biometrics in schools outweigh the benefits. Most frequently cited concerns include privacy, discrimination, constitutionality and poor use of funding. A majority of respondents said that there are no specific applications where biometric technology should be allowed in schools.

The most common reason respondents think biometric technology should not be used, regardless of the situation, is that there is little need for it. More respondents are open to biometrics being used to unlock a device where the data is locally stored.

In 2020, the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202210/entrenched-positions-on-biometric-surveillance-in-ny-schools-aired">Lockport City School District</a> had to shelve a <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202001/facial-recognition-gun-detection-system-implemented-in-lockport-schools-despite-controversy">300-camera system</a>. That was the same year the network went live after a state moratorium was placed on school use of biometrics.

The state education commissioner must now decide what to do with the recommendations, which will determine whether such a system should be placed in any state public school in the foreseeable future.

## Australia moves responsibility for federal biometrics to Attorney General’s Department

		The Australian government is in the process of rolling out digital IDs with the anticipation of putting out legislation for the system mid-next year, and shifting responsibilities as part of its preparations. As of August 8th, <a href="https://www.governmentnews.com.au/almost-3-million-mygov-users-take-up-digital-id/">2.9 million people</a> out of the 25 million people who use myGov have a digital ID, Government News reports.

On August 3rd, Home Affairs transferred responsibility for identity and biometrics policy to the Attorney-General's Department as the government prepares to expand its digital ID program, according to <a href="https://www.innovationaus.com/dreyfus-given-responsibility-for-biometrics-identity-policy/">Innovation Aus</a>. Home Affairs will now oversee protective security policy.

Legislation that would "enable facial biometric verification using state government data sources" could also come to pass at the same time that legislation around digital IDs is being considered.

The National Strategy for Identity Resilience was signed off by federal, state, and territory ministers in June, which said biometrics-based digital IDs that work nationally could become the norm in the country. Laws are likely to expand Identity Matching Services (IDMS) to include services like the Face Verification Service (FVS) and Face Identification Service (FIS).

The FVS allows a person's photo to be matched with their ID documents, with consent, and is already used by some government agencies. The FVS will expand to the government and private sector in the future partly to prevent the copies of credentials from needing to be stored. FIS, on the other hand, will only be used by national security and law enforcement for matching photos to government records.

The National Driver Licence Facial Recognition Solution would support such services, which is not yet in operation due to the Identity-Matching Services Bill not being passed in 2019, when the Liberal Party was in power.

Home Affairs awarded <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202301/australia-awards-fujitsu-26m-contract-for-id-matching-considers-face-biometrics-database">Fujitsu Australia</a> an AU$37.6 million contract to provide managed services for the IDMS program including the Document Verification Service and Face Matching Service back in January.

This follows the Digital Transformation Agency losing its <a href="https://www.innovationaus.com/dta-loses-digital-id-program-responsibilities/">digital ID program responsibilities</a> in July. “The confusion around digital ID is crippling the ability of the private sector to plan for a whole-of-economy system," says Paul Fletcher, shadow minister for government services and the digital economy, in a release. Fletcher’s party formed the government of Australia through years of digital ID efforts, until a change in administration after last year’s elections.

		<em>Aug 8, 2023 - </em>Biometrics hardware vendor <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/synaptics">Synaptics</a> has released its fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 financials.

For the quarter ended June 30, Synaptics reported a net loss of $23.4 million, or $0.59 per basic share on revenue of $227.3 million. That compares to net income of $82.9 million, or $2.09 per basic share, on revenue of $476.4 million for the same period last year.

The company's quarterly gross margin was 44.5 percent.

Fiscal 2023, Synaptics reported net income of $73.6 million, $1.86 per share, on revenue of $1.4 billion. This compares with fiscal 2022, when the company said it registered net income$257.5 million, $6.60, on revenue of $1.7 billion.

Company executives say they anticipate a gross margin from 43.5 percent to 47.5 percent and revenue of $215 million to $245 million.

Synaptics launched a <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/new-synaptics-match-in-sensor-fingerprint-sensor-frees-devices-from-a-host">new fingerprint sensor</a> during the quarter.
<h2>Idex chooses to leave the Nasdaq</h2>
<em>July 21, 2023 -</em>  Being listed on the Nasdaq exchange in the U.S. and the Oslo Bors in Norway is too expensive for fingerprint biometrics firm <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/idex-asa">Idex</a>, according to the company, which has decided to leave the Nasdaq. <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202011/idex-biometrics-files-for-nasdaq-ipo-with-75-to-1-share-ratio-for-15-offer-price">Idex’ American depository shares</a>, each of which represent 75 ordinary shares, should be a thing of the past as of August 10.
<h2>Biometrics sales tiny but stable for Voxx</h2>
<em>July 13, 2023 -</em> One the few quarterly financial statistics that have remained unchanged year over year for ailing <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/voxx-international">Voxx</a> International is in biometrics products. Voxx, the majority owner of <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/eyelock-inc">Eyelock, Inc.</a>, is primarily an international aftermarket supplier of <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202204/new-automotive-biometrics-growth-forecasts-patents-and-adjustments-unveiled">automotive</a> and maker of consumer electronics.

Posting its first-quarter 2024 results, the company reported that net sales of biometrics goods for the period ended May 31 was $100,000, the same as its first quarter in fiscal 2023.

Companywide, it recorded a widening loss. Voxx reported a net loss of $11.7 million, or $0.45 per basic and diluted share, on net sales of $111.9 million in the most recent quarter. This compares with a loss of $7.8 million, $0.27, on sales of $128.7 million for the same period a year ago.

CEO Pat Lavelle issued a statement: "We anticipate continued global softness and are in the process of realigning our operations, reducing our workforce and bringing down overhead to be profitable on lower sales volumes. New products and expanded distribution within our Consumer segment, and new vehicle models coming online in our Automotive segment should help offset some of the weakness, but we are expecting a weak global economy throughout 2023."
<h2>Intercede revenue, profit rise for just-completed fiscal 2023</h2>
<em>June 22, 2023 -</em> Digital ID cybersecurity firm <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/intercede">Intercede</a> has <a href="https://www.intercede.com/investor-news/rns-preliminary-results-for-the-year-ended-31-march-2023/">reported</a> an operating profit of £571,000 (US$727,810), or £0.023 per basic share ($0.029 per share), on revenue of £12.1 million ($15.4 million) for fiscal 2023, ended March 31. That compares with an operating profit of £390,000 ($497,100), £0.013 per share ($0.017) revenue of £9.9 million ($12.6 million).

The company says it has invested in the IT infrastructure backing its digital identity software, and that its financial position is strong and unleveraged.
<h2>GB Group fiscal '23 revenue climbs as profit turns to a loss</h2>
<em>June 16, 2023 -</em> ID verifier <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/gbg">GB Group</a> <a href="https://www.gbgplc.com/en/news/full-year-results-for-the-year-ended-31-march-2023-pr/">reports</a> a fiscal 2023 operating loss of £112.4 million (US$144.2 million) or £47.5p (or $.603) per share on statutory revenue of £278.8 million ($357.7 million). That compares with a fiscal 2022 operating profit of £23.4 million ($30 million) or £6.9p ($.086) on statutory revenue of £242.5 million ($310.7 million)
<h2>BIO-key belatedly files finance report for quarter ended in March</h2>
Authentication and IAM provider <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/bio-key">BIO-key</a> has made itself right with the Nasdaq exchange. The company had been notified that it was in danger of being delisted due to delayed financial reporting. Executives said they are current with requirements. The problem arose when the compilation and review of "certain financial information could not be completed" in time.
<h2>Thales stirs its bonds, issues €500M fixed rate</h2>
<em>June 9, 2023</em> - <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/thales-digital-identity-and-security">Thales</a> is refinancing a 2016 bond that has matured with a <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/worldwide/group/press_release/thales-issues-eu500m-bond">new issue</a> of €500 million (US$537 million) at a fixed rate of 3.626 percent that will mature in six years. The money also will improve the liquidity of the diversified multinational company with biometrics products.

Lead managers of the issue were BBVA, Commerzbank, Crédit Agricole Corporate &amp; Investment Bank, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, Natixis and Unicredit.

The 2016 <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/sites/default/files/database/d7/asset/document/emtn_-_thales_base_prospectus_-_may_2016.pdf">€3 billion</a> <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/sites/default/files/database/d7/asset/document/final_terms_of_the_2023_bond_issue_-_3_june_2016.pdf">bond issue</a> was lead managed by the same firms arranging the new bond.
<h2>Another biometrics firm misses its Q1 financials report deadline</h2>
<em>May 31, 2023 -</em> New Jersey-based biometric systems provider BIO-key told the Securities and Exchange Commission May 16 its first quarter financials report will be delayed an unspecified period.

Nasdaq, the exchange on which its shares trade, sent a <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/05/30/2678866/0/en/BIO-key-International-Inc-Receives-Notice-of-Non-Compliance-from-Nasdaq.html">notice</a> to <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/bio-key">BIO-key</a> May 23 that it is in breach of exchange requirements about timely financials report submission. Nasdaq's note is just that for now, but if noncompliance continues penalties can be significant.

In their alert to the SEC, executives issued boilerplate language about not being able to file performance figures on time without unreasonable expense and effort.

BIO-key has to show a plan to distribute the information, at which point Nasdaq officials can extend the deadline by up to 180 calendar days from the original deadline.

Mitek <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/4-biometrics-provider-quarterly-reports-that-do-not-look-scary-bad">said</a> the same to regulators earlier this month about its quarterly report when it could not produce the information on time.
<h2>Switch to software as a service continues at Trust Stamp</h2>
<em>May 26, 2023 -</em> Trust Stamp, a biometric multi-factor authenticator, is facing a moment in its history that separates the clients and employees who have faith in the plan and those who do not.

All the key financial numbers are sliding down rapidly. <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/trust-stamp">Trust Stamp</a> <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/05/15/2668776/0/en/Trust-Stamp-Reports-Q1-2023-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Update.html">reported</a> that its first-quarter loss was $2.5 million, or $.50 a share, on revenue of $485,000 for the period ending March 31. This compares with a loss of $1.69 million, or $.37, on revenue of $2.8 million for the same period a year ago.

Some portion of the drop is attributable to the plan that the company has been implementing for months. The idea is to switch from custom software development to software as a service, which is being executed now.

Executives added an <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202202/trust-stamp-bundles-biometrics-into-new-low-code-identity-orchestration-platform">orchestration layer</a> to its products and services, too, and they have been siphoning off resources from other sales efforts to staff the orchestration layer business. Sales, general and administrative spending was cut 37 percent between first quarter 2023 and <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202304/fiscal-22-transformative-for-biometrics-providers-trust-stamp-zwipe">2022</a>.

Trust Stamp says it expects "meaningful revenue" from this unit in fiscal 2024.

It has integrated orchestration layer products with the Driver License Data Verification System from the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators. With this done, according to the company, executives say they can build simplified ID tools for administrators.

All of that could lead to more revenue at some point, but today is not that point. Revenue fell by 84 percent in the most recent quarter compared to the first quarter of last year. Most of that drop, according to the software maker, was caused by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement contract that was terminated last year.
<h2>Q1 revenue rises for Idex</h2>
<em>May 25, 2023 -</em> Biometric sensor maker Idex saw its year-over-year loss narrow slightly during the first quarter, ended March 31. But its revenue rose by a third.

<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/idex-asa">Idex</a>, which makes sensors for cards and embedded devices, reported a loss of $7.2 million, or $.01 per basic and diluted share, on revenue of $1.2 million. This compares to a loss of $8.1 million, or $.01, on revenue of $989,000 for the first quarter of fiscal 2022.

Executives were able to reduce operating expenses on a quarter-to-quarter comparison. In the most recent period, the company reported $8.6 million and $8.9 million a year ago.

The market inflection point claimed in 2022, when nine biometric payment card programs using Idex sensors were launched, could be continuing this year. The company says seven <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/idex-reveals-integration-with-stm-a-turkey-deal-new-enrollment-method">Turkish and Bangladeshi</a> banks have committed to its sensors so far this year. Europe and the Middle East are showing "particularly strong" interest.

Mastercard <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202304/biometric-payment-cards-certification-for-idex-manufacturing-deal-for-zwipe">signed off</a> on Idex' fingerprint test assessment, which is essential to winning real estate on the finance company's cards. Complete certification, according to the company, is expected in the second quarter this year.
<h2>Encouraging signs in Voxx Biometric's Q4</h2>
<em>May 24, 2023</em> - <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/voxx-international">Voxx Biometrics</a>, a unit of electronics conglomerate Voxx International, <a href="https://investors.voxxintl.com/news-releases/news-release-details/voxx-international-corporation-reports-its-fiscal-2023-fourth">reported</a> a much-improved 2023 fourth-quarter gross margin compared to the final quarter of 2022, ended February 28. Voxx Biometrics said its gross margin was 39.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to a negative margin a year ago. No actual number was released.

The unit's net sales in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $400,000 as compared with $100,000 in the same period a year ago. Executives attributed the gain to rising customer numbers during the fiscal year.

Parent Voxx International reported a net loss of $30.9 million, or $1.17 a share, on revenue of revenue of $534 million for fiscal year 2023, ended February 28. This compares with a loss of $27.4 million, or $.92 a share, on revenue of $635.9 million for fiscal 2022.

The last fiscal year that Voxx was in the black was 2021, when it reported a profit of $26.7 million and a per-basic-share profit of $1.11.

## Worldcoin biometric enrollment frenzy sparks raid, concerns

		As questions continue to arise about Sam Altman’s <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/worldcoin">Worldcoin</a> venture, one thing is certain: we will be hearing a lot more about it. As the blockchain-based biometrics and cryptocurrency firm led by the founder of ChatGPT continues its mission to create “the world’s largest identity and financial public network,” regulators and authorities have begun to raise eyebrows over how transparent it is being with people trading their biometrics for WLD tokens.

Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cryptoverse-all-eyes-chatgpt-makers-worldcoin-2023-08-08/">reports</a> that more than 2.2 million people have already signed up to have their irises scanned by Worldcoin’s spherical biometric imaging tool, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/worldcoin-to-make-iris-biometrics-device-design-available-to-developers">the Orb</a>. In exchange, registrants receive a digital ID and, in some cases, a financial incentive of 25 Worldcoins, worth about US$50. More than 120 million Worldcoin tokens are currently in circulation, and the company plans to release 10 billion into the market over the next decade and a half.
<h2>A great eye, lidless, seeking fame</h2>
Worldcoin has scaled its biometric data collection quickly, setting up scanning booths in 20 cities across Africa, India and East Asia. According to an <a href="https://restofworld.org/2023/worldcoin-orb-around-the-world/">article</a> in Rest of World, the promise of easy money in exchange for a quick scan has spurred long lineups in Nairobi, Hong Kong, and Bengaluru, India.

For many who look into the Orb, the cost of living is such that they are happy to trade biometric data for what, in some currencies, is a significant sum. But some observers worry that people eager for free money do not understand the terms and conditions that come with it.

As reported in <a href="https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2023-08-07-revealed-the-ugly-side-of-worldcoin-that-may-have-escaped-your-eye/">The Star Kenya</a>, the fine print reveals some more rigid aspects of the trade-off. Details in the sign-up agreement make it difficult for users to pursue any kind of legal action against the company. In addition to the familiar language around indemnification, damages and liabilities, the agreement states that under no circumstances will Worldcoin pay out any amount exceeding US$100.
<h2>In Kenya, first a ban, then a police raid</h2>
The east African nation has been a hotbed of activity for the Worldcoin project, and a microcosm of its larger issues with privacy and legality. Thousands of Kenyans have already volunteered their iris scans for tokens, and the Worldcoin mobile app has topped the country’s download charts. On the other hand, the government has <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/kenya-bans-worldcoin-activities-as-citizens-trade-biometrics-for-tokens">suspended the company’s activities</a> and initiated a criminal investigation, citing potential risk to the public.

The situation escalated last week, when Kenyan police raided the Worldcoin warehouse in Nairobi. <a href="https://technext24.com/2023/08/07/kenyan-police-raid-worldcoin-warehouse/">TechNext</a> cites a local media report that described officers removing documents and data storage machines from a location on Mombasa Road.

Meanwhile, Kenya’s interior and information ministries issued a joint statement <a href="https://technext24.com/2023/08/04/kenya-denies-worldcoin-crypto-roundup/">denying</a> that the data controller registration certificate issued to Worldcoin in April is a valid license to operate in the country. The statement argued that a certificate only signifies compliance with certain sections of the Data Protection Act, and does not enable business operations.
<h2>Co-founder snaps back at criticisms</h2>
Worldcoin has done its own share of denying, in a pushback against allegations of lax security and biometric data leaks. The company has been dogged by reports that iris scans are being traded on a black market fueled by WLD.

Alex Blania, a cofounder of Worldcoin, spoke on the podcast <a href="https://unchainedcrypto.com/theres-not-a-black-market-for-biometric-data-worldcoin-cofounder-says/">Unchained</a> about these issues, emphasizing the company’s commitment to privacy and security. Blania acknowledged that users in countries where Worldcoin is not active were able to buy logins, but said users could not claim WLD tokens without paying another visit to the Orb for iris verification or face biometrics matching. He acknowledged that there’s nothing to fundamentally prevent credential trading for Worldcoin or the associated digital ID, but said the incentive to do so has dropped since the currency went live, and that it was more profitable to just sign up and take the free crypto.

As to questions about whether people who step up to the Orb know what exactly what deal they are making, Blania said, “It’s unfair to hold me accountable for the fact that people don’t understand how crypto works. These people might not understand everything fully. I don’t think that’s a bad thing. I think that’s how crypto actually will become mainstream. Even if you do everything perfect, the average person will not understand how crypto works.”

On Monday, Worldcoin faced another common mainstream tech problem, when its mobile app crashed after a spike in traffic, and users were met with various error messages barring access to their crypto wallets.

Since launch, a Worldcoin token has dropped 43 percent in market value, to US$2.04 as of Tuesday afternoon.

## China regulator floats curbs for face biometrics use, data storage

		Draft rules for how businesses can and cannot use facial recognition are being aired in China.

The proposed rules have been written by the Cyberspace Administration, a Chinese regulator that also covers automated collection of biometrics. And they are not what most people outside the autocracy would consider bold.

There have been <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202110/has-china-beat-the-west-to-detailed-ai-governance-rules">reports</a> for the last three years<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202101/states-ponder-facial-recognition-regulation-survey-shows-heightened-privacy-concerns-in-china"> illustrating</a> an increase in discomfort among Chinese citizens.

The bill addresses biometrics use by businesses. One rule would require that someone consent before they can be subjected to facial recognition, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/china-drafts-rules-using-facial-recognition-technology-2023-08-08/">according to</a> reporting by the Reuters news agency.

Analysis of face biometrics to determine ethnicity or religion would be banned, the <a href="https://hongkongfp.com/2023/08/08/firms-using-facial-recognition-in-china-face-new-rules-with-some-exceptions/">Hong Kong Free Press</a> reports. That would leave only the government and police markets open to the ethnicity detection systems <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/more-reports-that-hikvision-nvidia-still-involved-in-china-ethnic-surveillance">developed by Hikvision</a> and other domestic suppliers.

The Cyberspace <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202201/china-considers-legislating-face-voice-biometric-data-rules-for-deepfakes">Administration</a> is considering telling data collectors to choose non-biometric data sources whenever appropriate.

And some locations should be off limits to cameras: public bathrooms, changing rooms and hotel rooms, for example. <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/global-spike-in-predictive-policing-draws-on-ai-and-biometrics">Hotel room doors</a> are being equipped with facial recognition for the upcoming Asian Games in Hangzhou, and the technology has been used to prevent <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/201912/facial-recognition-payment-systems-rolled-out-in-denmark-growing-rapidly-in-china">toilet paper theft</a> for years.

Where cameras with face biometrics do go up in public spaces, it should be for public safety and prominent signs should warn people of their operation, according to Reuters.

A Chinese law professor won a <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202011/chinese-court-rules-in-favor-of-biometric-data-privacy-complaint-as-regulations-tighten">lawsuit against a safari park</a> for requiring him to submit his face biometrics for park entry in late-2020, in a sign of changes to come, at least for the private sector.

The draft legislation is open for public comment until September 7.

## US Homeland Security is using Clearview AI to crack pedophile cold cases

		The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been using <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/clearview-ai">Clearview AI</a>’s facial recognition tool to try and solve thousands of child exploitation cold cases, according to a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2023/08/07/dhs-ai-facial-recognition-solving-child-exploitation-cold-cases/">report</a> by Forbes.

In what insiders called “an unprecedented three-week operation to solve years-old crimes that has led to hundreds of identifications of children and abusers,” the DHS Homeland Security Investigations (HIS) unit used Clearview AI and other algorithmic tools to scan millions of images and videos stored in the HSI and Interpol’s databases of child exploitation material. According to Clearview, these uploaded images are cropped to show only faces, and tagged with a searchable signature.

Clearview AI is already a familiar partner for American security institutions. The HSI has signed contracts with the company worth up to $2 million, following on a deal with the FBI announced at the beginning of 2023, worth $120,000. In March, the founder and CEO of Clearview, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202304/hon-that-of-clearview-sued-for-breach-of-contract">Hoan Ton-That</a>, told the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-65057011">BBC</a> that the company had run close to a million biometric searches for U.S. police forces.

As Clearview AI grows, it has also ramped up its innovation efforts. In June, it <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/how-clearview-developed-its-method-for-fast-search-on-an-above-billion-scale-database">announced</a> that it had filed for a patent for a new vector indexing process, to allow search capability to scale with the size of its databases. It also made a series of <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/clearview-cro-and-advisory-appointments-indicate-military-and-intelligence-focus">new appointments</a> that suggested an increased focus on military and intelligence markets. And its <a href="https://www.clearview.ai/">website</a> invites visitors to read “How Clearview AI Helped Shape the War in Ukraine.”

The firm has received more widespread <a href="https://time.com/6182177/clearview-ai-regulators-uk/">attention</a> in mainstream U.S. media outlets than your typical biometrics platform. However, coverage typically includes the observation that Clearview’s purported library of more than 30 billion images was acquired by scraping websites such as LinkedIn and Facebook without consent.

Meanwhile, AI watchdogs continue to raise concerns that once governments start using facial recognition for justice operations, it is a slippery slope that leads to human rights abuses, including crackdowns on political protestors and overreach by law enforcement, which has greater impact on people of colour.

Forbes references the case of <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/black-woman-matched-by-facial-recognition-alleges-police-misconduct-in-lawsuit">Porcha Woodruff</a>, an eight-month pregnant woman in Detroit who was wrongly arrested for carjacking when facial recognition AI made a false match with her eight-year-old mugshot photo. Woodruff’s allegation, which comes with legal action against the police, is the third such claim of facial recognition leading to the wrongful arrest of a Black person in Detroit.

## India’s data protection bill passes lower house of Parliament, raises privacy concerns

		India's Digital Personal Data Protection Bill of 2023 passed in the lower house of Parliament and will now face the higher house before it becomes law, according to <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/data-protection-bill-passed-lok-sabha-key-points-8880776/">The Indian Express</a>. The bill as currently written raises privacy concerns as the ever-broader implementation of <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/india-doubles-down-on-biometrics-to-prevent-tax-fraud-aadhaar-authentication-use-cases-expand">Aadhaar digital IDs</a> gives the national government control over more of its citizens' data.

<a href="https://prsindia.org/files/bills_acts/bills_parliament/2023/Digital%20Personal%20Data%20Protection%20Bill,%202023.pdf">The bill</a> would exempt "any instrumentality of the state" from negative consequences, citing national security and maintaining public order as justifications. This means that the government would be able to use facial recognition to build surveillance systems, suggests Srinivas Kodali, a digitization researcher and self-described “hacktivist” in an opinion piece for <a href="https://thewire.in/law/will-the-data-protection-law-empower-the-public">The Wire</a>.

Some worry that this law could dilute the Right to Information (RTI) Act. As the law stands now, the central government will maintain control in appointing members to the Data Protection Board – the board that would manage grievances and disputes related to privacy.

Employers would also be able to collect biometrics of employees. Government employees must share their face biometrics and are monitored by surveillance systems while they work. Sanitation workers are already struggling to cope with mass surveillance through GPS tracking smart watches with <a href="https://thewire.in/labour/how-digital-snooping-on-sanitation-workers-is-worsening-their-struggles">cameras that can be turned on at any moment</a>.

Under the data protection bill, the national government would be able to process citizens’ data without their express consent. Private companies would be required to obtain consent from their customers or users before processing their personal data, but exceptions are made for “legitimate uses.”

The data protection bill’s approval by the Lok Sabha follows the higher legislature passing the Registration of Births and Deaths Amendment Bill this week. The latter bill digitizes the registration of births and deaths and allows Indians to obtain driver’s licenses, register to vote, sign up for an Aadhaar number, and more with only a birth certificate, according to <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/rajya-sabha-passes-registration-of-births-and-deaths-amendment-bill-4278012">NDTV</a>.

"Indians will be forced to part with their personal information from birth to death," argues Kodali.

The government argues that national and state-level databases of births and deaths will improve the delivery of social services and benefits.

An attempt by India’s government to pass a similar data protection bill was withdrawn last year.

## Governments, vendors less skittish about promoting facial recognition sales

		News of Colombia's decision to buy facial recognition software from a Spanish company for its national police force lacks one point common in virtually all previous announcements by other nations.

There is no explicit mention of how the software, from <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/herta-security">Herta Security</a>, will be used to find missing and exploited children.

That missing fig leaf, just like others still plucked by governments globally to make more palatable the growing blanket of live surveillance cameras in public spaces, shows how Western attitudes are changing about face recognition algorithms.

According to the Colombia <a href="https://hertasecurity.com/news/the-colombian-national-police-chooses-hertas-facial-recognition-software-to-strengthen-security-in-the-country/">announcement</a>, 80 cameras in a facial recognition network in the city of Medellín. Images captured will be compared against a database of 19,000 faces – people with outstanding arrest warrants and those who could help police in searching for criminals.

The system's cost has not been disclosed.

Also uncommon is how the announcement of the Rs1.4 billion (US$4.9 million) facial recognition project was handled in Karachi, Pakistan.

That project, called S-4, is supposed to create a net of cameras at 40 toll plazas around the city. All faces and license plates will be recorded.

Government officials have been unusually blunt. S-4 will be good for the city, but its primary purpose is surveilling to prevent crime and terrorism, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768756/murad-inaugurates-toll-plaza-surveillance-project">according to</a> reporting by independent Pakistani newspaper the Dawn.

A large, engraved plaque commemorating the project stands at the first plaza to be updated, Sassui. No one entering or leaving the city, at least on the toll roads linking municipalities, will travel unexamined.

Less typical is the announcement by the CEO of Russian state-owned defense contractor Rostec. <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/ntechlab">NtechLab</a>, a subsidiary of Rostec, installed its face surveillance systems for last year's <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202208/qatar-equips-15000-cameras-with-facial-recognition-for-soccer-world-cup-2022">FIFA World Cup</a> in Qatar.

In fact, the company says it has assembled networks for 36 nations, according to the <a href="https://tass.com/defense/1657573">Tass</a> news agency, which enjoys an uneven reputation for reliable reporting. It is known that India also has bought and deployed NtechLab facial recognition systems, and the company tells Tass that its software has been deployed to 220 cities in the country.

It is unusual for a vendor – private or public – to unilaterally announce it has sold this equipment to a government buyer.

Of course, sometimes news of government facial recognition projects just leaks.

Investigative journalism on the part of German broadcaster ARD reportedly has found that Bosch sold thousands of cameras to Iran, reportedly before such transactions were frozen due to human rights violations and other actions.

Bosch is a manufacturing conglomerate. Its wares include biometric surveillance infrastructure.

In this case, Bosch reportedly said it sent 8,000 cameras to Tehran between 2016 and 2018, <a href="https://www.iranintl.com/en/202308074447">according to</a> the independent anti-regime publication Iran International. The publication was reporting on the ARD report.

<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/08/07/bosch-sold-cctv-cameras-iran-identify-women-without-hijabs/">According to</a> the Telegraph news site, the theocracy's ruling clerics use Bosch cameras to find and identify women not wearing a hijab.

If government use of facial recognition becomes more acceptable to electorates, and leaks will likely fade. But if the opposite happens, insiders will find a way to get that news out.

## Nigeria’s INEC to deploy 11K biometric voter devices for November governorship polls

		The Independent National Electoral Commission of Nigeria (INEC) will deploy 11,355 biometrics-based Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) machines for three governorship elections in the country by the end of the year.

Daily newspaper Punch <a href="https://punchng.com/inec-prepares-11355-bvas-for-kogi-bayelsa-imo-polls/?utm_source=telegram&amp;utm_medium=social">reports</a>, citing an unnamed official within INEC, that the deployment will be done for the November 11 elections in the States of Bayelsa, Imo and Kogi.

The outlet quotes the official as saying that 2,400 BVAS devices will be deployed in Bayelsa, 5,079 in Imo, and 3,876 in Kogi. The number of devices to be deployed is more than the number of polling stations in those states, understandably as a precautionary measure to handle any likely glitches during the voter accreditation process.

INEC introduced the biometric devices during the general elections of February and March with the federal government later insisting that it <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202303/govt-insists-bvas-a-game-changer-in-nigeria-polls-civil-society-calls-for-nin-addition">enhanced the transparency</a> of the polls.

It suffered glitches notwithstanding, but the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/biometric-voter-machines-feature-in-nigerias-post-election-litigations">BVAS machines were used as evidence</a> by different parties during post-election litigations.

Yiaga Africa, a civil society organization which observed the general elections in Nigeria, recently noted in its report that the introduction of the BVAS was the right step in the right direction, but administrative and legislative measures should be taken in the future to ensure that the deployment of such technologies <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/group-urges-nigerian-govt-to-review-id-requirements-for-voter-verification">meet certain key integrity and reliability</a> standards.

## UK Biometrics Commissioner resigns in anticipation of role’s elimination

		UK Surveillance Camera and Biometrics Commissioner Fraser Sampson has stepped down. His emailed letter of resignation to Home Secretary Suella Braverman states that the functions of the two roles will be rendered irrelevant by the Data Protection and Digital Information Bill.

The Bill removes the responsibilities of the Biometrics Commissioner role and gives them to the Investigatory Powers Commissioner. This decision has been roundly criticized by <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202110/uk-pitches-less-oversight-for-surveillance-who-knows-what-for-biometrics-commissioner-role">Sampson and his predecessor</a> in the Surveillance Camera Commissioner role, Tony Porter, as well as <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/uk-plan-to-abolish-biometrics-commissioner-greeted-with-criticism">UK academics</a> and Porter’s <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/scottish-biometrics-commissioner-objects-to-proposals-to-abolish-position-of-uk-counterpart">Scottish counterpart</a>. It also eliminates the need to publish the Surveillance Camera Code of Practice, effectively hamstringing the Commissioner, Sampson argues.

He explains the timing is linked to the passage of the Bill, which is now not expected to be signed into law until early 2024 or later. The original Data Protection and Digital Information Bill was withdrawn from parliament in March, and a <a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3430">second version</a> advanced to the committee stage in May.

“Having explored a number of alternatives with officials, I am unable to find a practical way in which I can continue to discharge the functions of these two roles beyond 1 November,” Sampson says.

Sampson was appointed to the dual roles in <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202103/fraser-samson-named-new-uk-commissioner-for-biometrics-and-surveillance-camera-compliance">March of 2021</a>, and will remain in them until October 31.

		Biometric liveness detection has been added to <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/complycube">ComplyCube</a>’s document authentication software platform for know your customer checks and identity verification to thwart screen replay attacks, the company has announced.

There is an identity theft incident in the United States <a href="https://identitytheft.org/statistics/">every 22 seconds</a>, according to the National Council on Identity Theft Protection, many of them carried out by attackers presenting ID documents on monitors or mobile device screens, in some cases altered with the help of AI tools. The company’s presentation attack detection (PAD) layer provides security against these attacks, as well as fraud attempts with 3D masks and other artifacts, for its active or passive selfie biometrics checks.

The addition of “document liveness detection” is now integrated with ComplyCube’s Document Checking Service across various channels.

“For years, we’ve been researching, building, and deploying AI models to detect the presence of customers in photos and video accurately and indiscriminately. This has helped establish us as a leading liveness detection service provider, heavily relied upon by some of the largest organizations in the world,” says Harry Varatharasan, chief data scientist of ComplyCube. “We have now extended our proven technology to detect liveness on ID documents, boosting the unrivaled identity assurance level our award-winning platform already provides.”

ComplyCube CTO Mohamed Alsalehi adds that while some competitors market liveness detection for the selfie component of the identity verification process, they fall short on verifying the legitimacy of ID documents.

The company also launched a <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/complycube-launches-global-partnership-program-to-expand-aml-compliance-reach">global partnership program</a> just weeks ago.

		Identity authentication terminal provider <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/feitian-technologies-co">Feitian</a> announced that it has integrated <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/elyctis">Elyctis</a> digital ID readers into the V20 and V11 biometric authentication and verification devices, which are now available.

The resulting devices and docking stations can now read digital passports and national ID cards and perform OCR recognition, among other tasks. The devices have use cases such as voter authentication, KYC checks, paperless clock-in, and criminal identification that compares a user's face to a watchlist. This can be used in border control, government agencies, telecom and banks.

The <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202209/feitian-launches-customizable-handheld-multi-biometric-tablet-for-use-in-the-field">V20</a> is available as an Android tablet and docking station, while the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202205/feitian-unveils-portfolio-of-handheld-android-biometric-devices">V11</a> is a portable Android device that is roughly the same size as a typical smartphone. Both have fingerprint and face verification as well as NFC sensors. Iris biometrics are built into the V11 and optional for the V20.

"The combination of Feitian's expertise in identity authentication and Elyctis' cutting-edge e-ID readers enables us to provide our customers with highly reliable and efficient solutions," says Mr. Wang, Feitian's ID terminal division technology manager, in the announcement.

"By integrating our e-ID readers into their terminals, we are jointly enabling organizations to streamline their data collection processes and enhance the accuracy of identity verification," adds Alexandre Joly, CEO of Elyctis.

		Passwords are a challenging and a highly imperfect solution for granting account access to your trusted customers. Asking customers to re-assert their identity at every touchpoint only leads to frustration and abandonment. And passwords leave customers vulnerable to identity theft and account takeover attacks. 

For financial services firms and their customers alike, the risks and costs associated with passwords far outweigh the benefits.

Biometrics that can leverage widely available consumer devices are a more secure and convenient way to authenticate customers. But not all approaches are equal. In this e-book by <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/mitek-systems-inc">Mitek</a>, we’ll tell you why, and what to consider in your journey to a passwordless future with device-enabled biometric authentication.
