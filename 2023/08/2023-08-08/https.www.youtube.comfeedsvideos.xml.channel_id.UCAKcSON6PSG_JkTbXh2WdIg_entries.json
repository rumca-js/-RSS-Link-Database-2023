In a lively set that included hit songs \u201cCujo Kiddies\u201d and \u201cDaily Routine,\u201d Disq also surprised the audience with an impromptu rock-and-roll dogpile \u2014 somewhat ironically during the song \u201cGentle.\u201d Watch their full performance above.  \n\nWinter Dig Out was presented by The Current and Fat Tire. Those in attendance entered a random draw for a chance to win passes to the show. The event name took on quite literal meaning as the concert came on the heels of a massive snowstorm across Minnesota that lasted nearly 48 hours and produced 12 to 20 inches of snow, leaving large snow drifts across the southern and central portions of the state. Nevertheless, music fans' spirits were not dampened, as this concert attests.\n\nSet List\n00:00:00 I Wanna Die\n00:05:31 Cujo Kiddies\n00:09:59 (With Respect To) Loyal Serfs\n00:12:28 Gentle\n00:16:18 This Time\n00:19:38 The Hardest Part\n00:24:00 Daily Routine\n\nMusicians \u2013\u00a0@DisqOfficial \nIsaac deBroux-Slone \u2013\u00a0vocals, guitar\nLogan Severson \u2013 vocals, guitar\nShannon Connor \u2013 vocals, guitar\nRaina Bock \u2013\u00a0bass, vocals\nBrendan Manley \u2013\u00a0drums\n\nCredits\nVideo Director \u2013\u00a0Eric Xu Romani\nCamera Operators \u2013\u00a0Guillermo Bonilla, Peter Ecklund\nAudio \u2013\u00a0Evan Clark\nMixer \u2013\u00a0Eric Xu Romani\nGraphics \u2013\u00a0Natalia Toledo\nDigital Producer \u2013\u00a0Luke Taylor\n\nYou rely on The Current to keep you connected to the music you love, and we rely on you to power this station.
