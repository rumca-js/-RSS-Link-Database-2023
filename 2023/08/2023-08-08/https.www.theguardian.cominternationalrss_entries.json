What would it be like to <em>be</em> a young woman without The Bell Jar?</p><p>Plath\u2019s 1963 novel unleashed legions of artistic and chronically misunderstood girls on the world, allowing us to be exactly who we already were: highly sensitive, stuck-up, dazzlingly clever, crazy, ambitious, aimless, awkward and depressed. This book has meant everything to girls everywhere to the point where loving Plath and The Bell Jar has become a shorthand for female adolescent rebellion. When I first read The Bell Jar as a teenager, I didn\u2019t just identify with Esther Greenwood \u2013 I was Esther Greenwood. I felt that I was that lonely, awkward girl with a mania for academic achievement and accumulating prizes for my writing, a covert love for beautiful clothes, a well-meaning but uninspiring boyfriend and a mother who lived her dreams through her daughter.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></strong></p><p>Like so many other adolescent rites of passage, I came late to The Bell Jar. When I read The Bell Jar for an undergraduate women\u2019s writing class, I felt something new, brand new. It took me in from the start with its woozy charm and kidnapped my mind clean away. Which meant that it hurt like hell when she wrote about being \u2018yellow as a Chinaman\u2019 and worse when a few pages later there was \u2018a big, smudgy-eyed Chinese woman \u2026 staring idiotically into my face\u2019. The hurt kept me from reading on for a while. This often happened to me when I was reading books I loved. I felt betrayed because in the most routine, narcissistic, obvious way, I had thought that I was Esther Greenwood.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/09/i-grew-up-loving-the-bell-jar-then-i-noticed-how-sylvia-plath-wrote-about-people-that-looked-like-me\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/09/i-grew-up-loving-the-bell-jar-then-i-noticed-how-sylvia-plath-wrote-about-people-that-looked-like-me", "date_published": "2023-08-08T15:00:30+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "\u2018Where did I get my top?
