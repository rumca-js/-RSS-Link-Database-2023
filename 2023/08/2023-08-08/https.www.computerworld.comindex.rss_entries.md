The researchers found research dating back to the 1950s into using acoustics to identify what people write. They also note that the first paper detailing use of such an attack surface was written for the US National Security Agency (NSA) in 1972, prompting speculation such attacks may already be in place.</p><p>“(The) governmental origin of AS- CAs creates speculation that such an attack may already be possible on modern devices, but remains classified,” the researchers wrote.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3704351/researchers-build-a-scary-mac-attack-using-ai-and-sound.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
