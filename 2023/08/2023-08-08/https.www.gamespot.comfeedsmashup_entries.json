Meant to celebrate <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-18-gameplay-trailer-confirms-revenants-new-abilities/1100-6516523/\">Revenant's rebirth</a>, the collection includes 24 new premium cosmetic items with a vampiric theme. Players who collect them all will earn Revenant's new Death Grip <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-heirlooms-guide/1100-6495067/\">Heirloom Set</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to the sanguine cosmetic collection, the Death Dynasty Collection Event also gives players the opportunity to take advantage of some unique benefits. In addition to a surprisingly high-quality free reward track, the event also includes a massive XP boost to help players get a head start on their <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/apex-legends-season-18-all-resurrection-battle-pass-cosmetic-skins-loot-and-rewards/2900-4829/\">Resurrection battle pass</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">For the entirety of the event, players can earn double XP by playing specific game modes. This XP boost also stacks with the XP boosts found in the Resurrection battle pass--which themselves stack among party members--so players hoping to make quick progress on their Season 18 battle pass should definitely make the most of this opportunity by squadding up with friends and playing the appropriate game modes. Double XP will be awarded in the following modes:</p><ul><li dir=\"ltr\"><strong>August 8-15:</strong> Standard (non-Ranked) battle royale</li><li dir=\"ltr\"><strong>August 15-22:</strong> Mixtape Mode (<a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/respawn-sunsets-arenas-adds-tdm-playlists-to-apex-legends/1100-6511167/\">Control, Gun Run, TDM</a>)</li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\">When it comes to free loot, players are likely to be pleased with Death Dynasty's offerings. Apex's free reward tracks can sometimes be a little underwhelming, but it's clear that a good amount of thought and effort were put into the cosmetic designs. Players can earn these items by collecting Event Points (EP), which are earned by completing challenges from the \"Event Challenges\" tab located on the upper-right side of the main lobby screen. All items included in the Death Dynasty free reward track--and the amount of EP needed to unlock them--are listed below:</p><ul><li dir=\"ltr\"><strong>250 EP:</strong> Death Dynasty universal banner badge</li><li dir=\"ltr\"><strong>500 EP:</strong> 10 battle pass stars</li><li dir=\"ltr\"><strong>750 EP:</strong> What's Your Name universal holospray (Epic)</li><li dir=\"ltr\"><strong>1,000 EP:</strong> 3 battle pass stars</li><li dir=\"ltr\"><strong>1,250 EP:</strong> Midnight Meltdown Caustic banner frame (Epic)</li><li dir=\"ltr\"><strong>1,500 EP:</strong> Face Your Demons universal holospray (Epic)</li><li dir=\"ltr\"><strong>2,000 EP:</strong> Blood Drop weapon charm (Epic)</li><li dir=\"ltr\"><strong>2,500 EP:</strong> 25 Crafting Metals</li><li dir=\"ltr\"><strong>3,000 EP:</strong> 3 battle pass stars</li><li dir=\"ltr\"><strong>3,500 EP:</strong> 25 Crafting Metals</li><li dir=\"ltr\"><strong>4,000 EP:</strong> Blood Reaper Rampage weapon skin (Epic)</li><li dir=\"ltr\"><strong>5,000 EP:</strong> Twilight Torturer Caustic legend skin (Epic)</li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\">As you can see, this event's free rewards are epic in every sense of the word, with no Rare- or Common-tier items in sight. In addition to all the high-tier loot, players who complete the free reward track will also earn 50 Crafting Metals and 16 battle pass stars, which will instantly boost their battle pass by a little over one-and-a-half levels. On top of that, the event's free cosmetics all match the color scheme of the premium Collection Event cosmetics, so players who doesn't normally bother with free reward track cosmetics might want to rethink their stance this time around.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Speaking of premium cosmetics, the 24 cosmetic items making up the Death's Dynasty Collection can be obtained either by purchasing them directly with Apex Coins, crafting them with Crafting Metals, or opening Death Dynasty Event Packs, which are special Apex Packs that cost 700 AC ($7 USD) and each unlock one random item from the Death Dynasty Collection (along with two items from the evergreen loot pool).</p><p dir=\"ltr\">All items included in the Death Dynasty Collection are listed below, along with their prices.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Epic-tier items (available for 1,000 Apex Coins or 800 Crafting Metals):</strong></p><ul><li dir=\"ltr\">Ready Set Ghoul Octane legend skin</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Death Moon Seer legend skin</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Soulless Huntress Vantage legend skin</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Blood Gripped EVA-8 weapon skin</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Blood Revolution Devotion weapon skin</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Plasmatic Precision <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-18-patch-notes-confirm-disruptor-rounds-are-returning/1100-6516621/\">Charge Rifle</a> weapon skin</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Ritual Ascension Catalyst banner frame</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Summoning Fury Crypto banner frame</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Cosmic Horror Horizon banner frame</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Dusk Descent Loba banner frame</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Final Farewell Rampart banner frame</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Gothic Gateway Wraith banner frame</li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Legendary-tier items (available for 1,800 Apex Coins or 2,400 Crafting Metals):</strong></p><ul><li dir=\"ltr\">Void's Vassal Wraith legend skin</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Darkwatcher Crypto legend skin</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Hellforger Rampart legend skin</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Hell's Bane Loba legend skin</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Crimson Goddess Catalyst legend skin</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Brood Anomaly Horizon legend skin</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Exsanguinator R-99 weapon skin</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Blood Bolt Longbow weapon skin</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Sanguine Sidearm Wingman weapon skin</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Ethereal Heresy CAR SMG weapon skin</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Soul Devourerer Havoc weapon skin</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Blood Rage Rampage weapon skin</li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\">Players who collect all 24 Death Dynasty Collection cosmetics will also earn Revenant's new Death Grip Heirloom Set, which includes the following Mythic-tier items:</p><ul><li dir=\"ltr\">Death Grip Heirloom Weapon</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Soul Sacrifice Revenant banner frame</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Fight Your Demons Revenant emote</li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\">The cheapest way to unlock Revenant's shiny new scythe is to use Crafting Metals to craft as many of the event's Epic-tier items as possible, then obtain the remaining cosmetics by purchasing and opening Death Dynasty Event Packs, which are 700 AC ($7 USD) each. This will ensure you obtain the Death Grip Heirloom Set for 16,800 AC ($168 USD) or less, depending on how many items you're able to craft.</p><p>Keep scrolling for a detailed look at each of the cosmetic items included in both the free reward track and the premium cosmetic collection. The Death Dynasty Collection Event ends on Tuesday, August 22 at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET, so be sure to sink your teeth into your favorite cosmetics before they're gone for good, and stay tuned for <a

In addition to a completely <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-18-gameplay-trailer-confirms-revenants-new-abilities/1100-6516523/\">reworked ability set for Revenant</a>, the new season also boasts a new battle pass that's packed to the brim with 110 levels of stylish, spine-chilling cosmetic skins for legends and weapons alike.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">But the Resurrection battle pass has some pretty significant differences from its predecessors. It contains more Apex Packs than previous battle passes, and there have also been some changes made to the placement and implementation of the pass's two reactive weapon skins, among other high-tier rewards.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Every season's battle pass contains two Legendary-tier reactive weapons, special skins with animated and/or glowing visual effects that \"evolve\" as players rack up kills during a match. <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-trailer-suggests-revenant-reborn-coming-this-season/1100-6516410/\">Resurrection</a> is no different, including two reactive weapon skins for the EVA-8 shotgun. But instead of unlocking the first reactive weapon skin at level 100, the Resurrection battle pass allows players to get their hands on the first skin much earlier, with the EVA-8's Legendary Heart Of The Divine reactive weapon skin unlocked by simply reaching level 25 of the battle pass.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The second reactive weapon skin, the EVA-8's Legendary Heart Of Brimstone, is unlocked by reaching level 110, meaning players will still have to grind out those last 10 bonus levels if they want both weapon skins.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">One thing that hasn't changed when it comes to the Resurrection battle pass is the price. As always, the battle pass comes in three forms:</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Free:</strong> The free Resurrection battle pass is unlocked by default, and, as the name suggests, requires no purchase on the player's part. The free pass gives players access to limited battle pass rewards, mostly consisting of music packs, transition screens, and stat trackers for various legends.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Premium: </strong>Available for 950 AC ($9.50 USD), the standard premium battle pass gives players access to all 110 levels of premium rewards. Players who choose the standard premium Resurrection battle pass will instantly unlock the following items upon purchase:</p><ul><li dir=\"ltr\">A Gift To The Outlands transition screen</li><li dir=\"ltr\">10% XP Boost (increases the amount of XP earned for wins and Top 5 placements, applies to all party members, stackable)</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Advanced Reign Valkyrie legend skin (Epic)</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Blood Rush Octane legend skin (Epic)</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Bad Blood Caustic legend skin (Epic)</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Vortex Core L-STAR weapon skin (Legendary)</li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Premium Bundle:</strong> The Premium Resurrection Bundle is available for 2,800 AC ($28 USD). Players who purchase this version of the battle pass will receive all the rewards included in the free and premium versions of the battle pass, with the added bonus of immediately unlocking the first 25 levels of the battle pass, granting them instant access to the pass's Legendary-tier Apex Pack, Mad Maggie's new Outlawed Tech Legendary skin, the aforementioned Legendary-tier Heart Of The Divine reactive L-STAR weapon skin, and more.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Ultimately, both the premium Resurrection battle pass and the Premium Resurrection Bundle will grant players the exact same rewards--the more expensive option simply gives you access to those rewards much faster than the standard premium pass.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to cosmetic legend and weapon skins, holosprays, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-stickers-prices-odds-and-more/1100-6508846/\">stickers</a>, voice quips, music packs, skydive emotes, regular emotes, banner frames, and Season 18 kill count and win count stat trackers for all legends, the Resurrection battle pass also includes other useful goodies, like XP Boosts, Apex Coins, Apex Packs, and Crafting Metals.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>XP Boosts</strong> provide a 10% bonus to XP received from winning matches and placing in the Top 5. These bonuses stack between party members as well, so if you unlock all of them and play matches with squadmates who have also unlocked all seasonal XP Boosts, you'll gain a 300% boost to XP from wins and Top 5 placements.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">XP Boosts can be found at the following levels: 1, 6, 14, 22, 30, 38, 46, 54, 62, and 70.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Apex Coins</strong> (AC) are the game's premium currency, allowing players to purchase items from Collection Events and the in-game item store. Each battle pass contains enough AC to purchase the next season's battle pass, so technically, once you buy one Apex Legends battle pass, all future passes will effectively pay for themselves (unless you spend the AC on something else, obviously).
