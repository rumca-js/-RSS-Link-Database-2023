  <p id="FrLnrQ">Verizon is shutting down BlueJeans, its Zoom competitor it acquired in the early days of the covid pandemic, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/08/08/verizon-bluejeans-shutting-down/">as reported by <em>9to5Google</em></a>.</p>

<p id="lWY3WU">BlueJeans was a huge acquisition for Verizon; when the deal was announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21223454/verizon-bluejeans-video-zoom-conferencing-rivals">in April 2020</a>, CNBC reported that Verizon was going to pay around <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/16/verizon-will-buy-video-conferencing-company-blue-jeans.html">$...</a></p>

<p id="Stn3Ba">Both the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) fined banks for being unable to produce discussions going back to at least 2019.

  <p id="CAokF6">Apple TV Plus has revealed its first trailer for <em>The Changeling</em>, an eight-part series premiering on the service on September 8th. The trailer offers up a haunting glimpse at a man’s nightmarish journey to find his wife following the birth of their first child.</p>
<p id="JhCUCU"><em>The Changeling</em> is based on a novel of the same name written by Victor LaValle. It stars LaKeith Stanfield (<em>Atlanta</em>, <em>Sorry to Bother You</em>) as Apollo and Clark Backo (<em>Letterkenny</em>, <em>Confession</em>) as his wife Emma.

<p id="6rYS0D"><em>The Changeling</em> also stars Adina Porter, Samuel T. Herring, Alexis Louder, Jared Abrahamson,...</p>

Big Tech players like Microsoft and lavishly funded startups like OpenAI have earned invitations to the White House and the earliest of what will likely be many, many congressional hearings. They’re the ones that get <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/09/sam-altman-openai-chatgpt-gpt-4/674764/">big profile pieces</a> to discuss how their technology will end humanity. As politicians in the US and beyond grapple with how to regulate AI, this handful of companies has played an outsize role in setting the terms of the conversation. And smaller AI players, both commercial and noncommercial, are feeling left out — while facing a more uncertain future. </p>
