Disq, a rock band out of Madison, Wis., performed at The Current's Winter Dig Out at the Hook and Ladder Theater & Lounge in Minneapolis on Saturday, Feb. 25, 2023. In a lively set that included hit songs “Cujo Kiddies” and “Daily Routine,” Disq also surprised the audience with an impromptu rock-and-roll dogpile — somewhat ironically during the song “Gentle.” Watch their full performance above.  

Winter Dig Out was presented by The Current and Fat Tire. Those in attendance entered a random draw for a chance to win passes to the show. The event name took on quite literal meaning as the concert came on the heels of a massive snowstorm across Minnesota that lasted nearly 48 hours and produced 12 to 20 inches of snow, leaving large snow drifts across the southern and central portions of the state. Nevertheless, music fans' spirits were not dampened, as this concert attests.
