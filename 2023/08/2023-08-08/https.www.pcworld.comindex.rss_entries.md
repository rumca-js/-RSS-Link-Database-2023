<p>We&rsquo;ve all taken automatic language translation for granted, especially where web pages are concerned. But Google has finally added it to where it might be the most useful: the mobile version of Gmail.</p>



<p>To be fair, automatic translation has been a feature of Gmail for years, but only on the web. Now, Google is building it into its mobile app, where millions of people access their email every day. Android users will see automatic translation within their Gmail app via an update scheduled beginning today, August 8; iOS users will receive an update as early as August 21.</p>



<p>Like the web, you&rsquo;ll simply see a small banner at the top of an email which was authored in a foreign language. If your primary language is English, the banner will say &ldquo;Translate to English.&rdquo; (A follow-up will ask you if you want email in that language automatically translated: &ldquo;Automatically translate Spanish,&rdquo; for example.) Workplace or IT admins will have no control whether or not you opt in or out, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/08/adding-gmail-translation-to-mobile.html&amp;xcust=2-1-2024423-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">according to Google</a>.</p>

<p>You can refuse automatic translation via the automatic settings menu, but we doubt you&rsquo;ll want to. Google rates this as a &ldquo;highly requested&rdquo; feature, and we&rsquo;d agree. </p>

<p>We are terrible at passwords. Simply put, we suck at creating them and share them way too freely. Indeed, the very thing that can ensure our online security has become our biggest obstacle to it. And if you think you have good reasons not to use a password manager, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/709052/6-common-reasons-people-dont-use-a-password-manager-and-why-theyre-wrong.html">we can tell you why you&rsquo;re wrong</a>. </p>



<p>The best password managers relieve you of the burden of having to create and memorize unique, complex logins on your own. And they protect your passwords by encrypting your login info in a virtual vault&mdash;either locally or in the cloud&mdash;only allowing access with a single master password. If you&rsquo;re looking to step up your security game, a password manager is a way to do it. Yes, web browsers are starting to offer password management features, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3604671/why-your-browsers-password-manager-isnt-good-enough.html">but they&rsquo;re not good enough</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of our top picks for password mangers support Windows, Mac OS, Android, and iOS, as well as the major browsers. And all will let you sync your data across multiple devices, though you may have pay extra for that privilege. Once you&rsquo;ve found the right password manager for your needs, head over to our guide on <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394241/mastering-your-password-manager-5-must-know-tips.html">mastering your password manager</a>.</p>

<p><em><strong>Update August 2023:</strong> Interested in an offline password manager that&rsquo;s simple and straightforward? Our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2010172/keepassxc-password-manager-review.html">review of KeePassXC</a> shows it to be a worthwhile, friendlier alternative to KeePass&mdash;one that makes the transition away from an online password managers much easier. </em></p>

<p>Dashlane has always been a close contender with LastPass, so with the latter&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1419901/lastpass-got-hacked-again-and-this-time-your-data-got-taken.html">recent data-breach problem</a>, it&rsquo;s great to know that users still have Dashlane. A full-service password manager, Dashlane offers easy access to your logins, secure notes, payment data, and other information, all through its elegantly designed web portal or via one of its browser extensions for Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Opera, or Safari. Most importantly, its password game is strong, making it easy to generate and store complex, unique passwords and safely keep sensitive payment and personal data at your fingertips. With autofill deployed, Dashlane doesn&rsquo;t just ensure you use best password practices, but that doing so is practically effortless.</p>

<p>Dashlane is free for a single device, but if you want syncing across multiple devices you&rsquo;ll need a paid plan: The Advanced plan costs $33 annually or $2.75 per month, and adds dark web monitoring, to alert you whether your personal data is being used nefariously. The Premium account subscription costs $59.88 per year or $4.99 per month and includes all the features of the previous tiers and adds a VPN. The Friends and Family plan extends Premium plans to up to 10 accounts for $89.88 per year or $7.49 per month. These prices are a little higher than some of the competitors (indeed, that was one of LastPass&rsquo;s small advantages), but Dashlane offers a premium product and has provided a reliable service for years, and would you want anything less in a password manager?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a consumer&rsquo;s market when it comes to password managers. While we have our clear favorite above, Keeper is a very strong contender in its own right. It emphasizes security more so than many other password managers. For instance, it eschews an automatic password update feature as even this process would require temporary access to your credentials.</p>

<p>While Keeper&rsquo;s security-above-all-else mindset makes it one of the best, in the past it has come at the expense of things some consumers prize such as ease-of-use and aesthetics. To its credit, Keeper seems to recognize this and has taken strides to continuously update its interface to be more modern and user-friendly. While security-minded users stand to get the most out of Keeper&rsquo;s robust features set, even the everyday user will be safer for using it.</p>

<p>While most password managers require a master password to access your password vault, LogMeOnce relieves you of having to remember even that. It uniquely offers the option of a PIN, biometric, or photo login to access your vault. This feature gives LogMeOnce a unique edge over other password managers. </p>

<p>Other than this distinctive feature, LogMeOnce operates similarly to its peers. It allows you to store and sync passwords and credit cards across your devices with end-to-end encryption. It also includes other features such as dark-web and cyberthreat monitoring, but these will come at a bit of an additional cost. Its unique features make LogMeOnce one of the most convenient password managers we&rsquo;ve tested.</p>

<p>Bitwarden continues to offer a generous free plan that makes it a great option for users on a budget. It doesn&rsquo;t charge you a penny to save unlimited vault items or sync your vault across all of your devices. This is a refreshing change from other password managers that place heavy restrictions on free users.</p>

<p>While it may lack some of the advanced features offered by the paid services and its no-frills interface isn&rsquo;t the most user friendly, you can&rsquo;t argue against Bitwarden&rsquo;s price&mdash;it allows you to upgrade your security for free after all. It also offers an ultra-affordable paid tier with more advance features, but its free tier includes so much that you might not need anything else.</p>

<p>Free password managers come in all sorts of different flavors. Check out our roundup of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394076/best-free-password-managers.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">best free password managers</a> for more information.</p>

<p>KeePass is the password manager for those who like to control and tweak everything. It&rsquo;s an open-source program, and lacks the sort of polished, comprehensive UI other password managers offer, and thus may put off the average user. But tech-savvy tinkerers will love all of the customizable settings. It is functionally a very solid program on its own, but to truly realize its potential you will need to have some technical proficiency to take advantage of add-ons. Another big plus for the security-minded, is that KeePass doesn&rsquo;t store your data on the cloud. Everything is stored locally, so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about the security protocols of an online service (ahem, LastPass) to keep your personal data safe. A savvy user will make the file accessible to other devices by using a private cloud account. If you relish the idea of a highly customized, DIY password manager that is free and unconstrained by a third-party&rsquo;s policies and practices this is the product for you&mdash;and if you end up finding it too overwhelming, a simpler alternative like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2010172/keepassxc-password-manager-review.html">KeePassXC</a> may fit the bill just as nicely.</p>

<p>While most password managers focus solely on passwords, IronVest sets out to not only safely store your passwords, but make your entire online experience more secure. IronVest offers an intuitive and straightforward way to keep your passwords, identity, credit cards, email addresses, and other sensitive information protected while shopping online. Still a relatively new company, IronVest impressed with its ability to obfuscate personally identifiable information and block trackers in addition to just being solid password management software. It does this by masking your information when shopping. When you enter your email address, credit card, or other information on a site, IronVest creates and submits a masked version to the vendor so that they never see your actual information. It&rsquo;s a neat feature that helps IronVest stand out from the competition.</p>

<p>Some features of the service are still in beta, so you can expect minor tweaks and changes before the full release. Even though the application is still in its infancy, the feature set is solid and trustworthy. Besides, it&rsquo;s currently free to test out, so it costs nothing to give this unique and innovative service a try. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-to-look-for-in-a-password-manager">What to look for in a password manager</h2>



<p>At their most basic, password managers capture your username and password&mdash;usually via a browser plugin&mdash;when you log in to a website, and then automatically fill in your credentials when you return to that site. They store all your passwords in an encrypted database, often referred to as a &ldquo;vault,&rdquo; which you protect with a single master password.</p>



<p>Of course, most password managers do much more than this and many extend protection beyond your login credentials to other types of personal data. We narrowed it down to a few essential features that we looked for and you should too:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="password-generation">Password generation </h3>



<p>You&rsquo;ve been reminded ad nauseam that the strongest passwords are long, random strings of characters, and that you should use a different one for each site you access. That&rsquo;s a tall order. This is what makes password generation&mdash;the ability to create complex passwords out of letters, numbers, and special characters&mdash;an indispensable feature of any good password manager. The best password managers will also be able to analyze your existing passwords for weaknesses and upgrade them with a click.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="autofill-and-auto-login">Autofill and auto-login </h3>



<p>Most password managers can autofill your login credentials whenever you visit a site and even log you in automatically. Thus, the master password is the only one you ever have to enter. This is controversial, though, as browser autofill has long been a security concern, so the best managers will also let you toggle off this feature if you feel the risk outweighs the convenience.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="secure-sharing">Secure sharing </h3>



<p>Sometimes you need to share a password with a family member or coworker. A password manager should let you do so without compromising your security.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="two-factor-authentication">Two-factor authentication</h3>



<p>To an enterprising cybercriminal, your password manager&rsquo;s master password is as hackable as any other password. Increasingly, password managers support multi-factor authentication&mdash;using a second method such as a PIN, a fingerprint, or another &ldquo;trusted device&rdquo; for additional verification&mdash;to mitigate this risk. Choose one that does.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="protection-for-other-personal-data">Protection for other personal data </h3>



<p>Because of how frequently we use them online, credit card and bank account numbers, our addresses, and other personal data can be securely stored in many password managers and available to autofill into web forms when we&rsquo;re shopping or registering an account.</p>



<p>No online security measure is 100 percent foolproof, but most security experts agree that password managers are still the safest way for people to manage their myriad logins, and we agree that the benefits far outweigh the risks. Just choose your password manager carefully after researching all the options starting with this guide. </p>



<p><i><strong>Editor&rsquo;s note:</strong>&nbsp;Because online services are often iterative, gaining new features and performance improvements over time, our reviews are subject to change in order to accurately reflect the current state of the services.</i></p>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-block faq-block"><h2 class="faq-block-title" id="faq"> FAQ </h2><hr class="block-horizotal-divider" />

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="are-password-managers-safe">Are password managers safe?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>While nothing can be said to be 100 percent safe and secure, password managers do a great job of providing enhanced security features that you wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise have. Generally speaking, password managers encrypt all of the data you store with them. While cybercriminals might be able to somehow hack the password manager, it is highly unlikely they will be able to decrypt your data to see the contents.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, much of the security of your password manager comes down to the strength of your one master password. If you are concerned about the safety of this one password, then it would be worth it to choose a password manager that stores your master password on a different server from the rest of your encrypted passwords&mdash;adding an additional layer of security.</p>
</div>
</div></div>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="is-it-worth-paying-for-a-password-manager">Is it worth paying for a password manager?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>This will come down to what features you need in a password manager. Free services typically are limited to one device on which to save and sync your passwords. They will generate strong passwords for use, offer basic compromised-password alerts, and will store saved credit card and address information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Premium password managers, which you have to pay to use, offer all of the same features as their free counterparts, but also allow you to sync and store passwords and data across multiple devices&mdash;or even between family members. They also have additional special features such as dark web scanning and emergency contact access, among others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you only have one device and don&rsquo;t need any of the fancy additional features, then there really isn&rsquo;t a need to pay for a premium service. However, premium password managers are only a few dollars per month so they won&rsquo;t break the bank if you ever decide to switch.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-if-the-password-manager-gets-hacked">What if the password manager gets hacked?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>If you suspect that you have been hacked, it is important to first figure out if it&rsquo;s just you or if your password manager&rsquo;s database has been compromised. Reputable password managers should put out some form of public release if they have been hacked. You can figure this out with a simple Google search. If they are not claiming to have been hacked, then it may be that your own data has been compromised some other way.</p>



<p>If it turns out your password manager&rsquo;s database has been hacked, it&rsquo;s up to you whether to continue with that service. Thankfully, all your passwords will be encrypted so hackers won&rsquo;t be able to see the contents even after they have been stolen.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="is-using-one-master-password-for-your-password-manager-really-safe">Is using one master password for your password manager really safe?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>It can seem a little disconcerting to entrust the security of all your passwords to one master password on a password manager. It&rsquo;s true that the strength and safety of your master password can determine the security of your password manager itself. Therefore it is ideal to create a very strong master password.</p>



<p>The good news is that password managers typically store your master password and your other encrypted passwords and data on separate servers. This isn&rsquo;t foolproof, but it does add an additional layer of security.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-are-passkeys-do-i-need-a-password-manager-if-i-use-passkeys">What are passkeys? Do I need a password manager if I use passkeys?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Passkeys are a new form of account authentication. It&rsquo;s a system that uses a set of encrypted keys, with a private one that you keep and a public one given to a website. To log in, you have to approve the attempt to see if the keys pair. Major tech companies <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1815683/how-to-set-up-and-use-passkeys-with-your-google-account.html">like Google</a>, Apple, and Microsoft are pushing to see passkeys widely adopted across the web, as they&rsquo;re simpler and more secure than passwords.</p>



<p>While most mentions of passkeys talk about storing them on a smartphone, you can store them in other ways, too, like on a hardware key or (as you might have guessed) a password manager. Multiple password managers have begun adding support for passkeys, with <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.dashlane.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-407092-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Dashlane</a>, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://nordpass.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-407092-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">NordPass</a>, and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://1password.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-407092-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">1Password</a> just a few of the services that can now store them. And while passkeys seem to be the future of online security, passwords likely will stick around for a while. Using a service to keep track of both kinds of authentication will be very useful.</p>

## Researchers steal passwords using only keyboard sounds

<p>A noisy, clicky-clacky keyboard is the joy of (at least some) <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1966306/best-mechanical-keyboards.html">mechanical keyboard fans</a>. But you might want to rethink that position, if the murderous glares of your family and coworkers aren&rsquo;t enough to convince you already. A team of security researchers in the UK has created a system that can listen to your keystrokes and record exactly what you&rsquo;re typing &mdash; even over a web conferencing app like Zoom. </p>



<p>To be clear, this isn&rsquo;t an active threat &ldquo;in the wild,&rdquo; more of a proof of concept so that security managers can be aware of a potential danger. Researchers from <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.01074.pdf&amp;xcust=2-3-2024051-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Durham University, University of Surrey, and Royal Holloway University of London</a> (PDF link) developed a two-step process: recording a selection of keystrokes from a specific keyboard via a compromised vector, like a smartphone loaded with targeted malware, then using those recordings to &ldquo;train&rdquo; an algorithm to determine the audible differences in the sound each individual key on the keyboard makes. </p>



<p>Put that data through an analysis program and you can &ldquo;hear&rdquo; what&rsquo;s being typed with up to 95 percent accuracy. That&rsquo;s via the local smartphone method &mdash; recordings made through Zoom and Skype were &ldquo;just&rdquo; 93 percent and 91.7 percent accurate, respectively. </p>



<p>For the tests the team used a MacBook Pro and an iPhone as the initial recording point, though the system was limited to just 36 keys, the primary letter and number keys. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-acoustic-attack-steals-data-from-keystrokes-with-95-percent-accuracy/&amp;xcust=2-3-2024051-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">According to Bleeping Computer</a>, the training system needed to &ldquo;hear&rdquo; each key pressed 25 times in a row in order to create a reliable training system, and it also needed the input of the keys in the form of the text being typed. After that, it was able to transcribe what was being typed based on audio alone. That means a system to replicate these results in the real world would probably need a lot more input in order to develop a reliable model; You don&rsquo;t use the Z or X keys as often as E and A, for example. </p>

<p>Key noise reduction doesn&rsquo;t seem like a valid mitigation option, since laptop keys are about as quiet as it gets already. The researchers encourage those who want to protect themselves against this kind of attack use randomized passwords &mdash; a 20-character password with lots of uppercase letters and special characters would be sufficiently complex to prevent an automatic detection with a 95 percent accurate system.

## Valve may sell refurbished Steam Decks at a big discount

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>The Steam Deck remains one of the hottest pieces of tech this year, despite would-be rivals like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1951380/asus-rog-ally-review-2.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Asus ROG Ally</a> appearing on the market. And since it&rsquo;s incredibly cheap (at least for the laptop-grade hardware inside it), it&rsquo;s also very difficult to find on sale outside of Valve&rsquo;s seasonal promotions. But that might change soon. An internal listing on the Steam store showed listings for officially refurbished Steam Deck models, starting as low as $319 for the 64GB base version. </p>



<p>The leak comes from pages that appeared on Steam briefly yesterday before being taken down, and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://steamdb.info/sub/903905/&amp;xcust=2-3-2023987-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">can still be spotted on SteamDB</a>. The 256GB model was listed at $419, while the top-of-the-line 512GB version was $519. Discounts stack up as you go higher: $80 for the base model, $110 for the middle model, and an impressive $130 for the high-end version &mdash; though of course, nothing is set in stone yet. </p>



<p>The Steam Deck is surprisingly accessible in terms of repair, with the main screen assembly being the only thing that&rsquo;s really difficult to work on from a DIY perspective. (And even <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1923399/steam-deck-gets-an-aftermarket-1080p-screen-upgrade.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">that&rsquo;s not totally off-limits.</a>) But even so, as a portable device there are bound to be some that get dinged up, to say nothing of the inevitable percentage that are damaged in manufacturing or transit. With so many of these things in the (literal) hands of PC gamers, selling officially refurbished models would be an easy way for Valve to recoup some losses. </p>



<p>Precisely when Valve will start selling the refurbished Steam Deck isn&rsquo;t clear. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.pcgamer.com/valve-lets-slip-plan-to-sell-refurbished-steam-decks/&amp;xcust=2-3-2023987-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">As PCGamer notes</a>, it&rsquo;s possible that the company could scrap the project at any time. But if pages were already being prepped for publishing on the Steam store, that seems highly unlikely. The more probable scenario is that we&rsquo;ll see the pages go live once again, with full ordering options, sometime in the next few weeks. </p>

<p>Windows 11 contains a deeply hidden feature that allows you to embellish your Windows desktop with colorful stickers. You can choose from cartoony clipart stickers like a small bee or a purple broccoli, and freely place and move them around. The stickers don&rsquo;t offer any functionality whatsoever, but they&rsquo;re a fun, secret way to put a personal touch on your desktop.</p>



<p>If you want to activate the stickers, you need to add them to the Windows registry. Type <strong>regedit</strong> in the Windows 11 search box, open the Registry Editor, then navigate to the folder <em>&ldquo;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\PolicyManager\current\device&rdquo;</em>. </p>



<p>Right-click the &ldquo;device&rdquo; folder and select <em>New &gt; Key</em>. Name the new key &ldquo;Stickers&rdquo;. Right-click on &ldquo;Stickers&rdquo; and select <em>New &gt; DWORD value (32-bit)</em>. Then give the new DWORD the name &ldquo;EnableStickers&rdquo;. Double-click on &ldquo;EnableStickers&rdquo; and set the &ldquo;Value&rdquo; to &ldquo;1&rdquo;. You must then restart Windows. Now you can activate the stickers!</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Windows 11 Desktop - Aufkleber" class="wp-image-1979556" height="703" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/pcw08_sticker.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>Windows 11 contains a hidden feature that allows you to decorate your desktop with stickers. There are a large number of cartoon motifs to choose from.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG</p></div>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Note: The stickers are only available if you have selected either &ldquo;Picture&rdquo; or &ldquo;Windows Spotlight&rdquo; for &ldquo;Personalize background&rdquo; in the Windows Setting&rdquo; under <em>Personalization &gt; Background</em>. With the &ldquo;Picture&rdquo; setting, the &ldquo;Fill in&rdquo; option must be active for &ldquo;Select a suitable picture for your desktop&rdquo;. To remove the stickers again, call up &ldquo;Add or edit stickers&rdquo;, click the sticker you want to remove, and then click on the recycle bin symbol.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There are two ways to use the stickers. First, you can right-click on a free space on the desktop and select &ldquo;Add or edit stickers&rdquo;. Alternatively, you can open the Windows Settings app and head to the <em>Personalization &gt;Background</em> section. Scroll down there and click on &ldquo;Add stickers&rdquo; next to &ldquo;Select stickers for your wallpaper&rdquo;.</p>



<p>In both cases, a window opens with a selection of clipart. Click on one of the stickers to transfer it to your desktop. There, you can move and resize it. You can select as many clipart stickers as you want to use!</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re in the market for a zippy monitor for those long gaming sessions, you better hold onto your seat, as we&rsquo;ve got a great deal for you today. Amazon&rsquo;s currently selling the <a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=14154&amp;GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Acer-XV272U-Pbmiiprzx-Technology-DisplayHDR400/dp/B0C4Z8RFY9?ascsubtag=2-2-2023726-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">Acer Nitro gaming monitor for $199.99</a>, which is 33 percent off of the original $299.99 price. This monitor has a refresh rate of 180Hz and a response time of 1ms, which should help with smooth visuals and gameplay. It also has two speakers and it&rsquo;s compatible with VESA mounting devices. </p>



<p>The Acer Nitro is quite spacious at 27-inches, which is a great size for competitive gaming, as it allows you to have a wide view of the game you&rsquo;re playing. The monitor also has a resolution of 2560&times;1440. That&rsquo;s delightfully sharp for playing games and watching movies. You&rsquo;re even getting AMD FreeSync, which helps reduce any screen tearing issues. It achieves this by syncing up the monitor&rsquo;s refresh rate with your PC&rsquo;s GPU. For ports, you&rsquo;ll find one DisplayPort 1.2, two HDMI 2.0, and one audio out port.</p>



<p>This is a fantastic deal, but things tend to change quickly around here, so you better hop on it now.</p>

</div>


<p>While faster in some ways and slower in others than its less expensive MP44L cousin, the MP44&rsquo;s use of 232-layer NAND allows it to deliver up to a whopping 8TB of capacity. It also delivered a delightful surprise during our drive-nearly-full testing.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">

</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="mp44-design-and-price">MP44 design and price</h2>



<p>Aside from being a 2280 (22mm wide, 80mm long) M.2, PCIe 4.0 SSD, the MP44 is a host memory bus design (your device&rsquo;s memory is used for primary caching duties) like the older MP44L. In this case, however, utilizing a brand-spanking-new Maxio MAP1602A controller and 232-layer TLC NAND. </p>



<p>At the time of this writing, the MP44 was available on Amazon at $58 for 1TB (the capacity of our review unit), $110 for 2TB, $267 for 4TB, and $820 for 8TB. There&rsquo;s also a 512GB version, though it was not listed on Amazon. </p>



<p>Note that the MP44 will also be available in a 2230 (22mm wide, 30mm long) version&ndash;the MP44S, which will fit in smaller M.2 slots such as those found on a Steam Deck.</p>



<p>The main takeaway here is that the MP44 is available in massive capacities, albeit at a slight premium per terabyte for the 4TB version, and a significant surcharge per terabyte for 8TB.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>If you need 4TB or 8TB, then the MP44 is the SSD you want. </p></blockquote></figure>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-2012404" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/mp44-rear-in-testbed.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The back of the MP44 sitting in our latest test bed.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Considering that the faster-in-some-ways MP44L is available  for $42.49 for 1TB, and $77.98 for 2TB, that drive might be the better bargain in the lower capacities (see the performance section below).</p>



<p>The MP44 is warrantied for five years, which is mitigated only by some rather interesting, and overall generous TBW (terabytes that may be written to the drive) ratings: 700TBW for the 512GB, 1,450TBW for the 1TB,  2,500TBW for the 2TB, 3,000TBW for the 4TB, and 6,000TBW for the 8TB. </p>



<p>Considering the extra money you pay for the two larger capacities, their TBW ratings are merely decent. In truth, most users never come close to exceeding even a low TBW rating.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-does-the-teamgroup-mp44-perform">How does the Teamgroup MP44 perform?</h2>



<p>Though successor drives tend to be faster than their predecessors, that was not the case in every test with the MP44. In synthetic benchmarks the MP44 appears faster in terms of sequential throughput, but it fell well off the pace in random operations and slightly off in our 48GB transfers.</p>



<p>As you can see below, the MP44 beat up on its MP44L cousin, as well as two similarly priced drives, the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1933516/sabrent-rocket-q4-nvme-ssd-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Sabrent Rocket Q4</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1966808/wd-blue-sn580-nvme-ssd-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">WD SN580</a>, in CrystalDiskMark 8&rsquo;s sequential throughput tests. AS SSD (not shown) offered a similar opinion.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-2008059" height="628" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/teamgroup-mp44-CDM8-seq.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">If CrystalDiskMark 8 were the only test you ran, the MP44 would look like a sure-fire improvement over the older MP44L. However, other tests showed that this may not be the case. Longer bars are better.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>However, with the exception of 32-queue, single-thread read test, the MP44 was far less facile during random operations, as shown below. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-2008060" height="625" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/teamgroup-mp44-CDM8-rnd.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This was the most concerning result for the MP44&ndash;falling well behind the older MP44L and other SSDs. Longer bars are better.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>In the real world, slower random ops means the MP44 may not run your operating system quite as quickly as some other drives. Not that it&rsquo;s possible to discern a slow NVMe SSD from a fast one these days with the naked eye.</p>



<p>The MP44 turned in very good times in our real-world 48GB transfers, even if it lost by two seconds to the older MP44L, which is a very fast drive in these tests. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-2008061" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/teamgroup-mp44-48GB.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The MP44 did well in the 48GB transfers, just not quite as well as the older MP44L. Shorter bars are better.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Note that 1TB drives generally suffer a bit in our 450GB write (shown below) due to less NAND to employ in secondary caching (writing as one-bit SLC, rather than QLC in this case). </p>



<p>The Sabrent in the charts is amazingly fast in this test, but it&rsquo;s a 2TB drive that never slowed down an iota from its frenetic 3GBps transfer rate. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-2008062" height="599" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/teamgroup-mp44-450GB.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The MP44 lost by a wide margin to the older MP44L. Shorter bars are better.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>You can tell from the following image just where the issue in the 450GB write was&ndash;the point at which the write slowed. The MP44L slowed to 1.6GBps just past the halfway point, while the MP44 slowed sooner, about a third of the way through.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-2008066" height="409" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/teamgroup-mp44-slowdown.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The older MP44L slowed later than the newer MP44 in our 450GB write, but look at the next image.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As vendors are improving HMB and secondary caching, and the purpose of our large file write is to force the SSD to write NAND natively, we&rsquo;ve started writing even more data. </p>



<p>This is where the MP44 shocked us. While writing 900GB to the 1TB drive, it never slowed dramatically as did the MP44L, not to mention every other drive we&rsquo;ve &ldquo;exhausted&rdquo; secondary cache on. Native writing can drop to 100MBps with QLC, and we normally see 200MBps to 500MBps with TLC. </p>



<p>The Phison-based MP44L eventually drops to 140MBps (or less) and took 43 minutes, 24 seconds to write the 900GB. The MP44 never dropped below 800MBps in our first run and took only 11 minutes and 44 seconds to write the file. It did, however, drop to around 600MBps at the 80 percent mark on subsequent 900GB writes. This still made for sub-12 minute times. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-2012384" height="304" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/910GB-copy-capture.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="962" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The MP44 maintained 1.6GBps to the end of the first run. However, it dropped to around 600MBps at the 80 percent mark on subsequent 900GB writes. This still made for sub-12 minute times. </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>This sort of sustained performance when a drive is almost full is unprecedented. In fact, we reconstituted our large files to make sure that de-duplication wasn&rsquo;t a factor, or at least not a major one.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;re not sure how the long-term, high-rate sustained writing was accomplished, but hats off to the Maxio controller and Micron NAND folks. If the trend continues, it may change our recommendation to overbuy by 2X your needs in terms of capacity, to something less drastic.</p>



<p>Overall, the MP44 is fast, but a mixed bag performance-wise compared to its Phison-based MP44L sibling. We were mightily impressed by the 910GB write, but that type of operation is extremely rare, and the random numbers were subpar. Again, not something you&rsquo;re likely to notice without a benchmark. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="should-you-buy-the-teamgroup-mp44">Should you buy the Teamgroup MP44?</h2>



<p>Though bargain and mid-range SSD prices have dropped through the floor, every penny counts and you&rsquo;re likely better off with the less expensive, and in many cases faster MP44L up to 2TB of capacity. If you need 4TB or 8TB, then the MP44 is the SSD you want. Also, go for the MP44 if you plan to fill the drive further than the 50 percent that&rsquo;s currently the industry recommendation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-we-test-ssds">How we test SSDs</h2>



<p>Internal drive tests currently utilize Windows 11, 64-bit running on an X790 (PCIe 4.0/5.0) motherboard/i5-12400 CPU combo with two Kingston Fury 32GB DDR5 4800MHz modules (64GB of memory total). Both 20Gbps USB and Thunderbolt 4 are integrated to the back panel and Intel CPU/GPU graphics are used. The 48GB transfer tests utilize an ImDisk RAM disk taking up 58GB of the 64GB of total memory. The 450GB file is transferred from a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://Talking%20to%20Phison,%20it%20seems%20likely%20that%20the%20Micron%20N48%20NAND%20is%20simply%20blazing%20in%20pSLC%20mode%20(pseudo%20Single%20Level%20Cell/1-bit)%20and%20the%20E21T%20improves%20greatly%20on%20HMB%20performance.%20Whatever%20the%20reason,%20you%20get%20real%20world%20sustained%20transfers%20we've%20only%20seen%20with%20the%20latest%20PCIe%205.0%20drives.&amp;xcust=2-1-1966808-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/1966808/wd-blue-sn580-nvme-ssd-review.html">Samsung 990 Pro 2TB</a> which also runs the OS. The 900GB file is read off of a Crucial T700 PCIe 5.0 SSD.</p>



<p>Each test is performed on a newly formatted and TRIM&rsquo;d drive so the results are optimal. Note that in normal use, as a drive fills up, performance will decrease due to less NAND for secondary caching, as well as other factors.</p>



<p><strong>Caveat: </strong>The performance numbers shown apply only to the drive we were shipped and to the capacity tested. SSD performance can and will vary by capacity due to more or fewer chips to shotgun reads/writes across and the amount of NAND available for secondary caching. Vendors also occasionally swap components. If you ever notice a large discrepancy between the performance you experience and that which we report, by all means, let us know.</p>

<p>Roccat&rsquo;s recent design aesthetic looks so futuristic you could easily transfer any of the company&rsquo;s products&mdash;the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/833406/roccat-kone-xp-gaming-mouse-review.html">Roccat Kone XP</a>, or <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1418294/roccat-burst-pro-air-wireless-gaming-mouse-review.html">Roccat Burst Pro Air</a> mice included&mdash;onto the set of a <em>Blade Runner</em> remake and no one would even blink an eye.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s with this same brush that Roccat has primped the Syn Max Air, which is the successor to the company&rsquo;s Syn Pro Air gaming headset. The Syn Max Air doesn&rsquo;t reinvent the wheel but does go one better than its predecessor in terms of sound quality, comfort, and the added convenience of a wireless charging station.</p>



<p>With excellent cross-platform compatibility and versatile connectivity in the form of dual wireless (Bluetooth and 2.4GHz Wi-Fi), it also makes possible one of my all-time favorite gaming pleasures&mdash;streaming music while gaming on my PC.</p>



<p>That said, the Syn Max Air does have a very small candy bag-sized cluster of niggling quirks, mostly centering around its microphone. While these quirks don&rsquo;t spoil the experience, they might leave you questioning its rather high $249.99 price tag.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-does-the-syn-max-airs-design-differ-from-other-headsets">How does the Syn Max Air&rsquo;s design differ from other headsets?</h3>



<p>Among the first things you&rsquo;ll notice is the square cuboid-shaped cups, which offer gamers a refreshing alternative to the mundane round cups that have become the predominant style of choice. Of course, square cups aren&rsquo;t anything new, but glasses friendly ones with ProSpec earpads like the Syn Max Air&rsquo;s are&mdash;the design of the cups providing grooves for spectacle frames to fit through.</p>



<p>Beyond that benefit, though, personally I loved how the Max Air&rsquo;s cup shape reminded me of timeless characters from classic sci-fi TV shows like the Cyberman from <em>Dr Who</em>. But what&rsquo;s infinitely more important is that the cups fit well, and thankfully, they did.</p>



<p>One complaint about this headset&rsquo;s predecessor was the scratchy mesh fabric that made up the inner lining of each earcup. It&rsquo;s scratchy no more, I&rsquo;m happy to report. Gamers can now enjoy a mesh-like material in the inner rim and plush leatherette around the sides, both of which feel soft and cool. The cups have plenty of memory foam cushioning on them too.</p>



<p>These comfort gains aren&rsquo;t compromised by the Syn Max Air&rsquo;s 11.5 ounce (325 gram) weight either, which is only marginally heavier than the 10.97 ounce (311 gram) Syn Pro Air&rsquo;s weight. Trying it on, I found it to feel weighty but not to produce any kind of fatiguing pressure.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Of course, square cups aren&rsquo;t anything new, but glasses friendly ones with ProSpec earpads like the Syn Max Air&rsquo;s are.</p></blockquote></figure>

</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>The construction is an interesting mix of plastic and light aluminum. The black matte plastic in the cups isn&rsquo;t the flimsy kind that likely had you in tears as a kid because your RC car got pulverised by a truck. No, it&rsquo;s a lot stronger than that. The band being obviously comprised of metal is stronger still&mdash;although surprisingly, there&rsquo;s a complete absence of clamp pressure.</p>



<p>What there&rsquo;s no absence of, however, is RGB lighting. Here, Roccat&rsquo;s budget could have been squandered on just a simple RGB ring, but it&rsquo;s been put to good use illuminating honeycomb layers in the bottom corner of each cup and beneath the charging station. All this RGB is programmable and also compatible with the Roccat&rsquo;s AIMO RGB ecosystem.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Roccat Syn Max Air" class="wp-image-2012663" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cups.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>The Syn Max Air&rsquo;s earcups feel luxurious and comfortable.&nbsp;</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>The headband utilizes a unique cylindrical rod mechanism to adjust the height of the cups. It holds its positioning at exactly the elevation you want it. The same kind of stubborn immovability can be found in the cups, unfortunately. They <em>can</em> swivel through 180 degrees but are incredibly tight to move. In fact, if you&rsquo;re prone to a getting a sore neck, don&rsquo;t expect any easing from these cans.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-kind-of-controls-do-you-get-in-the-syn-max-air">What kind of controls do you get in the Syn Max Air?</h3>



<p>There aren&rsquo;t really a lot of controls on the Max Air to tinker with. You get a volume wheel, a mic monitor button, power button, and Bluetooth button. The Syn Max also comes with a detachable unidirectional TruSpeak microphone that clips into the left earcup. This has flip-to-mute functionality, which saves a lot of fumbling around in the dark.</p>

<p>For the $249.99 sticker price there&rsquo;s no point mincing words about the kind of controls I wish the Max Air had. For starters, I would have liked to see the addition of a 3.5mm auxiliary port for the flexibility of being able to hardwire my connection on the fly.</p>



<p>Additionally, I could have done with an audio mixer and Bluetooth control&mdash;both of which are controls you can find in the Logitech G&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1533230/logitech-g-astro-a30-wireless-headset-review.html">Astro A30 Wireless</a>&mdash;which is a fantastic gaming headset that ships for $20 less. Still, the fact you get a charging dock somewhat makes up for the rather basic selection.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="roccat-max-syn-air-compatibility-and-connectivity">Roccat Max Syn Air compatibility and connectivity</h3>



<p>You can use the Roccat Syn Max Air with Microsoft Windows 10/11 PCs but also your Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5 and cell phone too, which makes it a do-almost-everything device.</p>



<p>The connectivity consists of 2.4GHz Wi-Fi as well as Bluetooth, or a wired connection via the supplied USB-C to USB-A cable. The Wi-Fi and Bluetooth can be used simultaneously, which is a very cool feature. It means you can stream an additional audio source of your choice to your headset while playing&mdash;but more on that later.</p>



<p>Putting all that connectivity to good use I mainly used the device in Wi-Fi Mode on my desktop PC with the included 2.4GHz USB transmitter, but the Bluetooth became extremely handy for gaming on my laptop when the limited number of ports were all occupied.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Having a closer listen revealed the Max Air&rsquo;s drivers to be especially tuned for mid-range frequencies, a fact that&rsquo;s going to especially favor esports players of games like <em>Fortnite</em> or <em>CounterStrike: Global Offensive</em>.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>I also used Bluetooth to enjoy a few hours of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> on my Nintendo Switch. However, strangely enough, in Bluetooth mode you can&rsquo;t just adjust the volume using the headset&rsquo;s volume wheel; instead, you need to adjust the volume on the device itself, which is quite inconvenient.</p>



<p>On the upside though, the charging doc is super useful. It meant I always had somewhere to keep my headset safe. It also made charging simple enough, although according to Roccat the Syn Max Air gives you only 16 hours playtime on a single charge. Compare that to the 40 or so hours you get from the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/814589/razer-barracuda-pro-review.html">Razer Barracuda Pro</a> and honestly, 16 hours seems a little small.</p>



<p>Still, with your charging station set up next to your rig, even 16 hours of battery life is never likely to be a much of a problem.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="whats-it-like-gaming-with-the-roccat-syn-max-air">What&rsquo;s it like gaming with the Roccat Syn Max Air?</h3>



<p>Updating the headset&rsquo;s firmware in the Swarm companion software app took longer than expected. Thankfully, I didn&rsquo;t abort the mission, because the audio was well worth the wait. The Syn Max Air&rsquo;s 50mm Nanoclear drivers produced a nice balanced sound that&rsquo;s certainly a marked improvement on the audio quality of its predecessor the Syn Pro Air.</p>



<p>Having a closer listen revealed the Max Air&rsquo;s drivers to be especially tuned for mid-range frequencies, a fact that&rsquo;s going to especially favor esports players of games like <em>Fortnite</em> or <em>CounterStrike: Global Offensive</em>.</p>



<p>Beyond these superficial musings, you should also know that compared to headsets like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1787658/steelseries-arctis-nova-7x-wireless-headset-review.html">Arctis Nova 7X</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/403382/logitech-g935-gaming-headset-review.html">Logitech G935</a>, which ship a little cheaper, the Max Air&rsquo;s audio sounds slightly distant, as if the sound is coming from further away. That isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing, but it isn&rsquo;t going to be to everyone&rsquo;s liking. I had some success making the audio sound a little closer by tweaking the 10-band Equalizer settings in Swarm, so it&rsquo;s good to know you have that option.</p>



<p>When it comes to the directionality of the sound, I had no complaints. In a game of <em>Insurgency,</em> for example, I enjoyed a nice soundscape of explosions and ricochets from all the main directions of a compass. This really added to the sense of realism I got.</p>



<p>Footsteps weren&rsquo;t so pronounced, however. Turning up the volume helped to fix this but made the rest of my audio quite loud too. A better solution was simply switching on a setting called Superhuman Hearing, which basically accentuates critical game sounds just like player footfalls. Used properly this feature can be a big asset for FPS players.</p>

<p>But the real gem in the Max Air&rsquo;s crown for me was the simultaneous Bluetooth functionality. Pairing with my phone to stream music really helped improve my performance&mdash;I mean who can resist the uplifting power of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers while lobbing a few grenades? That&rsquo;s how I like to use this feature anyway, but you could just as easily use it to stream a podcast or take phone calls too&mdash;other equally uplifting things.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s not to say everything worked seamlessly. I had a grievance with the Max Air&rsquo;s microphone actually. Although it generally conveyed my voice clearly, it was a little too short to reach my mouth, picked up a lot of ambient noise, and at times its indicator sound just went off all on its own, like some kind of battery-operated kids&rsquo; doll gone haywire.</p>



<p>These are issues that didn&rsquo;t leave a very positive impression of the mic for me period. But since I&rsquo;m not a big mic user anyway, they didn&rsquo;t do much to spoil my experience.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="should-you-buy-the-roccat-syn-max-air">Should you buy the Roccat Syn Max Air?</h3>



<p>The Syn Max Air is a leap ahead of its predecessor the Syn Pro Air in sound quality and is eminently more comfortable. It also has commendable cross compatibility and simultaneous dual wireless connectivity&mdash;features any self-respecting gamers are going to love.</p>



<p>While an underperforming mic, and steep $250 price tag may give some gamers reason to pause at the checkout, just as many will be blown away by features like its decent 3D audio, glasses friendly design, dedicated charging dock, and brilliant RGB. Those features alone make it a rarity among headsets and a solid choice worth considering. </p>
