<p>Inaugural report shows Labour languishing on 29% of the vote while National records 34.5% as cost of living concerns dominate</p><p>A new political poll has put New Zealand’s centre-right opposition solidly ahead of the ruling Labour party in the lead up to October’s election, with the National and ACT parties recording the majority support needed to form a coalition government.</p><p>Labour languished on 29% of the vote in the Guardian Essential poll New Zealand, which polled more than 1,100 eligible voters, with National recording 34.5%. ACT received 11.6% of the vote. Respondents unsure about how they would vote – 6.1% of those surveyed – were included in the final result.</p><p><em>This poll was conducted by Essential Research and has a sample size of 1,163, using quotas set to be representative of the target population by age, gender and location. Respondents not eligible or not intending to vote are excluded from voting intention questions. Weighting is applied to the data using factors of age, gender, location and enrolment status, from Statistics New Zealand and New Zealand Electoral Commission data. The poll was conducted through online panels between 2-6 August 2023, has a maximum margin of error of +/- 2.9%, a weighting efficiency of 97%, and 6.1% were unsure on the party vote question. Unsure voters remain in the final result, but were removed for the purpose of calculating seats in Parliament.</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/09/guardian-essential-poll-new-zealand-national-holds-clear-lead-over-labour-as-election-nears">Continue reading...</a>

<p>If measure up for consideration succeeds, it could make it much more difficult for abortion amendment to qualify for the ballot</p><p>Good morning, US politics blog readers. The state of Ohio is holding an unusual special election in the middle of the summer today, where voters are being asked what seems like a fairly innocuous question: should the bar for changing the state constitution via a ballot initiative be raised to 60% support, from its current simple majority? But the measure, which would also increase the number of signatures required for campaigners to get an initiative on the ballot, is, in fact, a Republican-backed attempt to undermine a constitutional amendment protecting abortion access that is expected to go to voters in November. If the measure up for consideration today, known as Issue 1, succeeds, it could make it much more difficult for the abortion amendment to qualify for the ballot.</p><p>Republicans dominate the state government in right-leaning Ohio, and even before Roe v Wade was overturned, passed a law restricting the procedure after six weeks of pregnancy, though its implementation is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/oct/07/ohio-court-blocks-six-week-abortion-ban-indefinitely">currently blocked by a judge’s ruling</a>. But <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/03/kansas-abortion-vote-state-constitution">even in red states</a>, reproductive rights advocates and their Democratic allies have seen success in protecting abortion at the ballot box, and they’re hoping to repeat that today.</p><p><strong>Mike Pence</strong> said he has qualified to appear on the stage when the first Republican presidential debate is hosted on 23 August.</p><p><strong>Joe Biden</strong> is in Arizona, where <a href="https://apnews.com/article/grand-canyon-monument-biden-tribes-1fa3d27c48651e2dc844c9c49a0cd14f">he will designate</a> a new national monument near the Grand Canyon intended to protect the national park from mining.</p><p><strong>Legal wrangling</strong> continues in <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s case over the attempts to overturn the 2020 election, with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/07/trump-evidence-witness-transcripts-january-6">the judge yesterday ordering</a> a hearing to consider prosecutors’ request for limits on what information the former president can share publicly.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2023/aug/08/trump-jan-6-ohio-abortion-vote-republican-biden-latest-news">Continue reading...</a>
