For all his qualities as a manager, Julen Lopetegui has form when it comes to leaving high-profile jobs on the eve of big competitions. With his Spanish team already in Russia ready to contest the 2018 World Cup, on the eve of the tournament Lopetegui revealed he would be taking over at Real Madrid as soon as it concluded. It was an announcement that so riled up the Royal Spanish Football Federation that it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/13/julen-lopetegui-sacked-spain-manager-real-madrid-job\">fired him on the spot</a> and gave his gig to Fernando Hierro instead. A little more than five years later and it seems the 56-year-old has now parlayed his way out of another job. Reports suggest Lopetegui is currently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/08/wolves-gary-oneil-manager-julen-lopetegui\">thrashing out an exit deal</a> with the Wolves bean-counters after channelling his inner Scott Parker and repeatedly criticising the lack of summer investment at Molineux.</p><p>The new added-time guidelines (yesterday\u2019s News, Bits and Bobs, full email edition) are intending to increase the amount of football actually played during a match.

It\u2019s a pointed image for grappling with a national identity in flux, with personal identities that tussle with contradictions.<br /><br />Everyone in the wrestling team hugs their wounds and secrets. Coach Pamela is intimidatingly certain in her instruction, yet her own identity swims in doubt. Imogen, a minted Londoner (\u201cBlack first, rich second\u201d), wants to educate Scottish-Jamaican Jo in the ways of Black sisterhood, separating her from childhood friend Chantelle.

We also hear about wrestling\u2019s categories and rules of engagement; the shifting middle ground in the tug of war; tartans that don\u2019t encompass every wearer: the metaphors here write themselves, not always with nuance.<br /><br />Johnny McKnight\u2019s tireless production, with movement direction by Lucy Glassbrook, bounces around on the balls of its feet. With 60 scenes in just 80 minutes, McCleary\u2019s scrappy dialogue scenes often feel all too brief but her monologues pursue a thought further, and the strong cast mine nuggets of feeling whenever they get the opportunity: Adiza Shardow\u2019s quizzical distress as Jo, the doubt behind Lesley Hart\u2019s coaching fervour or Maureen Carr\u2019s shy smile as Helen belatedly channels her inner bad bitch.<br /><br />Costume designer Sabrina Henry has created an original tartan for the production \u2013 a punchy weave cut with pink and yellow.

As Streep puts in her beautiful performances, you want to punch the air</p><p>A few years ago, when naming a career-best comedy trio featuring Steve Martin and Martin Short, the presumed missing person would be their Three Amigos costar Chevy Chase. But now, as their hit show Only Murders In the Building enters its third season, Selena Gomez has firmly taken that spot. What seemed like stunt-casting when the series premiered back in 2021, or a cynical ploy to give the show cross-generation appeal, has created one of the most delightful trios on television. In the show\u2019s best season to date, the amateur sleuths/podcasters return to solve another murder, the warm chemistry between them is even more bewitching, and the mysteries and twists are inspired. The dialogue is still silly but sharp, and it truly sings when Martin, Short and Gomez all interact to create an old-school jazzy quality. It is not the easiest narrative to sell, to convincingly keep these very different characters, who have little in common, in each other\u2019s lives \u2013 but good news! The old gang have to get back together because, you guessed it, there was a murder, and it was in the building.</p><p>Technically, the second season of this mystery-comedy series ended on a murder. Oliver (Short) was finally back directing a play on Broadway after a notorious flop landed him \u201c15 years in Broadway jail\u201d. Alas, on opening night, his superstar lead Ben Glenroy (Paul Rudd), collapsed dead, seemingly ending the play, and Oliver\u2019s career, again. Not that the success of that play felt assured, given the show\u2019s tendency to make every element as absurd as possible. On occasion, this is something that has proven grating, but this time round the daftness of the fact that Oliver is directing \u201cA play called Death Rattle. Set in a lighthouse in a Nova Scotia where the only witness to a murder is a baby,\u201d never gets old. Particularly in the scenes where the self-serious actors are giving it their all in rehearsals, and Rudd\u2019s Hollywood blowhard of a character has to brandish a rattle threateningly. Thankfully, he is given more than just a cameo and is phenomenal as a douchebag movie star who swans into rooms, makes a series of penis jokes, lets his co-star Kimber (Ashley Park) know he has \u201ctimber for Kimber\u201d and swiftly hands out a series of NDAs. Every detail about Rudd\u2019s Ben is hilariously terrible, from his treatment of his assistant/brother, his strong opinions on the colour palette of his dressing room, to his biggest claim to fame being the star of a series of \u201cCoBro\u201d films, where he plays a \u201cbro\u201d able to transform into a large Cobra that helps the police.</p><p>Only Murders in the Building season three is on Disney+.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/aug/08/only-murders-in-the-building-season-three-review-meryl-streep-helps-make-the-best-season-ever\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/aug/08/only-murders-in-the-building-season-three-review-meryl-streep-helps-make-the-best-season-ever", "date_published": "2023-08-08T04:00:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Summer picks: should we ban artificial grass? \u2013 podcast", "description": "<p>Installing artificial grass is becoming an increasingly popular way to achieve a neat, green lawn without much effort.
