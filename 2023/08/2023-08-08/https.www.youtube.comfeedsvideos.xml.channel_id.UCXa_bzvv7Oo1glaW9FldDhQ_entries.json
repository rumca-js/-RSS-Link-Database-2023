It's not a remake or a remaster. It's also not releasing natively for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, instead coming to PS4 on August 17th. PC players? Forget about it.\n\nThe re-release packages the 2010 classic that fans know and love with the Undead Nightmare expansion and Game of the Year Edition content (except without multiplayer). There may be some slight visual improvements, but otherwise, this is the same title that launched back in the seventh console generation.\n\nExcept it retails for $49.99, while you could find the original for half-price. Suffice it to say that fans are angry, and Rockstar's track record for underwhelming remasters/re-releases doesn't help.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74QF-2aua_Q", "date_published": "2023-08-08T09:30:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/74QF-2aua_Q/hqdefault.jpg"}]
