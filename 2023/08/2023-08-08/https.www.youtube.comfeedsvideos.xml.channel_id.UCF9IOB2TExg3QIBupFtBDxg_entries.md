Investigation into overreaching, federal COVID-19 vaccination mandates and policies at the,

Department of Defense (DOD), U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Department of Labor (DOL), and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). 

Chairman Wenstrup is requesting access to all documents, communications, and guidance,

utilized by these agencies to craft their coercive policies prior to forcing a novel vaccine — that did not stop the spread or transmission of the virus — on millions of Americans. 

At the Select Subcommittee’s hearing on vaccine mandates last week, expert witnesses highlighted the Biden Administration’s abuse of executive power and disregard for individual freedoms that resulted in employment termination, decreased military readiness, and increased distrust in public health authorities. 

The Select Subcommittee is seeking further information from DOD, OPM, DOL, and HHS regarding any political interference by the Biden White House and other outside organizations on federal COVID-19 vaccine mandates.
