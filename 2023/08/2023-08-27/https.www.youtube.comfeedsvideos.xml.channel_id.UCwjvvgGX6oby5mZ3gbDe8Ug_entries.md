China has nearly 100,000 reservoirs to speak of, and the data shows that their capacity could meet all of China's water consumption for a year. Theoretically, China should have enough water in its reservoirs for a year, even if it doesn't rain, so it shouldnâ€™t be afraid of drought or flood. But, in reality, the management of China's reservoirs is chaotic, and the quality of the projects is compromised in every way.
