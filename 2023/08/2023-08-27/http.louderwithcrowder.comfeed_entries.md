The corporate media is focusing on him "<a href="https://www.newsweek.com/tucker-carlson-flies-budapest-apologize-behalf-us-1822671" target="_blank">apologizing on behalf of the United States</a>" over Ambassador David Pressman criticizing the country's anti-LGBTQ illustration.

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/theblaze/status/1695267436549878214" target="_blank">From the transcript</a>:</p><p>"The ruling party is the party of the childless, the unmarried, the people working for low wages for large corporations and living in tiny apartments in overcrowded cities that are rife with crime." </p><p>"Who votes for the people who run the United States right now? People who are working for big banks, living in crowded conditions, very often alone, in big soulless cities, having their food delivered by immigrants, and spending their time glued to a screen. What does that sound like to you? It sounds like prison, actually." </p><p>"Who are the people who oppose this? Where do they live and how do they live? Well, they are poorer generally on paper. But are their lives worse if you live in a place where you can see the sky? Where you can make your own food? If you can go outside and identify three species of trees or hear birds, or experience silence, the rarest commodity in the modern world. Those are the people who are not with the program. People who have a daily experience of nature. And those people are much more likely to acknowledge a power beyond themselves and their government."</p><p>"And there's a reason for that because they can see it. When you're living crowded as you would on an industrial farm as a cow, you are not liberated. You are enslaved. Your reference points are gone. You can't see the stars. You cannot see God's creation. All around you you see drywall and screens. And your ability to think clearly goes away."</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Some idiot at the WH put Joe Biden in front of a whiteboard and the internet went bananas with it

## David Hogg's desperate attempt to avoid a conservative reporter is pathetic even by his usual Hoggy standards

<p>The unintentional humor isn't with him playing copyrighted music to prevent the reporter from uploading his video. Fairplay on that. If you want to avoid answering questions, it's a smart tactic. But it's in the way he proclaimed with much bravado, or as much bravado as his soy-built frame could muster up, that "this is copyrighted music" as if he just owned the reporter.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>No, you're still owned. If the kids still say pwned, you'd be that too. All Hogg did was declare to the world he's too big of a weiner to defend his schtick. David's anti-gun nonsense only works when he is never challenged. We now have further evidence of this because, even though he was playing copyrighted music, you can still upload videos to Rumble and X.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
