The Witch is 42 custom instrument racks for Ableton Live Suite (11) made from the Make Noise Strega hardware synthesizer. It captures the alchemical and mysterious vibes of the Make Noise Strega and turns them up to 100, incorporating polyphony, space, texture, and distortion.

Aimed at cinematic sound design, horror, dark ambient, video game music and atmosphere, post-rock, and industrial, this pack rides the edge of beauty, horror, death, and rebirth.

You'll find pads, drones, leads, noise, sfx, atmosphere, and more. Each instrument is built with 8 macros to shift the sound in different and valuable ways.

This is for you if you like spooky scary, achingly beautiful, weird sounds.
