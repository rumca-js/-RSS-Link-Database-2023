I'm heading off to the NOVA Open in Washington DC this upcoming week and there'll be a Games Workshop preview and all kinds of tournaments and hobby seminars and everything WARGAMING. We'll talk about that and of course, I'll also answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!

Vince Venturella and I made another game! Check out MAJESTIC 13 at http://www.majestic13game.com

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
