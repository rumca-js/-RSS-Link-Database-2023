  <p id="gpLm07">Hi, friends! Welcome to <em>Installer</em> No. 3, your guide to the best and <em>Verge</em>-iest stuff in the world. Thanks to everyone who sent stuff in this week — we’re starting to get the hang of how this all works, and I really hope it’s fun and useful! I know I’ve already downloaded a terrifying number of new apps thanks to y’all.</p>
<p id="vbmV9y">Only one housekeeping thing today: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/rss/installer-newsletter/index.xml"><em>Installer</em> now has an RSS feed</a>! You can add this link to any RSS reader, and it should work (let me know if you run into issues). Also, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/installer-newsletter"><em>Installer</em>’s new homepage</a> has every edition ever — all two of them so far. We’re still working on some cool new ways you can subscribe and contribute to <em>Installer</em>, but hopefully, we’ve got all the basics covered now.</p>
