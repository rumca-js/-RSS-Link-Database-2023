I get cold very quickly in the water, enough that unless it's close to
body temperature I get chilled through within ~15min.  This mostly
wasn't a problem, because I'd take a quick dip to cool off and then
hang out on the beach, but now that I have kids they (and I) want lots
of swimming together time.  When I touched on this </span>

<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4CmAtozcAHXbakWAz/weekday-evening-beach-picnics?commentId=r4ENMYrvNECNKWs7A">trying
a wetsuit</a>, and yesterday evening I did for the first time!



<p>

It was different in a bunch of ways, but on balance I like it a lot.
Some things I noticed:



</p>

<p>

</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Initially there was some air in my suit, which felt funny
bubbling out.

</p></li>
<li><p>The suit is slightly buoyant, taking some getting used to.

</p></li>
<li><p>It still felt cold getting in, until my body had time to heat
up the trapped layer of water.

</p></li>
<li><p>I didn't get cold in the water!  This was with maybe ~78F water
and ~82F air.  I could play with my kids until they wanted to get out
of the water.

</p></li>
<li><p>I bought separate pants and a vest, which I wore under my
swimsuit.  The pants worked very well, and the vest worked ok: I got a
bit of water rotating through where they met, and I occasionally
needed to pull the vest down.  Possibly a full body suit would have
been better? But those seem more annoying to get in and out of, and
the amount of water moving through was pretty low with the kind of
playing we were doing.

</p></li>
<li><p>Once I got out of the water, I stayed wet a lot longer.  This
was warmer than usual for the first part, since it was a warm sort of
wet, though after we got to the stage where I normally would have been
fully dry (~45m?) I was mildly colder.

</p></li>
</ul>



<p>

Overall I'm happy, and am looking forward to swimming with it again in
the future!

</p>

<p>

(My kids are now asking if they can get ones too, which is fine with
me!)
