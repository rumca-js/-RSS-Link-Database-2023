At first she finds solace with her old friend Declan \u2013 an artist working as a barman \u2013 and former boyfriend Mikey, a junior doctor.

Tramfuls of chanting fans spill out on to suburban streets and swagger through the gates. It\u2019s a football-crowd atmosphere.</p><p>Gallagher\u2019s own entrance, though, is less assured.

He might be the poet, but \u201cI see all that I will ever know/ I see all that I will ever be/ And it\u2019s warm outside\u201d is hardly Tennyson. <br /><br />Maybe sensing this slightly flat atmosphere, Gallagher attempts to rouse the crowd; he kicks into footy mode. The camera pans to a massive Manchester City lightbox on stage before centring on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/pep-guardiola\">Pep Guardiola</a> cutout, sparking full-on boos from Man Utd fans among the throng. Low-level banter continues throughout the set, most of it dedicated to calling out a man he spots in the crowd, Luke, who once asked him for a selfie. Whenever there\u2019s a lull, the screen lurches back to the cutout and Gallagher dedicates AKA... What a Life! (his finest solo moment) to City but Going Nowhere to United.

When he decided on a career switch into politics, he wasn\u2019t required, as many wannabe parliamentarians are, to demonstrate his commitment by first fighting an unwinnable constituency. He bagged a safe Conservative seat at the first time of asking. He was an MP at the age of 34 and chancellor before he turned 40. And then the wheel of fortune turned against him. He was promoted to Number 10 at the worst point of the political cycle to become prime minister.</p><p>I don\u2019t say this to elicit sympathy for the Tory leader.

Writer Leon, however, hunkers down with a pack of cigarettes and a mounting sense of injustice and prepares to have a thoroughly miserable time of it.</p><p>With his lofty pretensions and his rapacious need for affirmation, Leon (a superb Thomas Schubert), is one of the most overtly comic characters created to date by the German writer-director Christian Petzold. And on the face of it, <em>Afire</em> (winner of the Silver Bear grand jury prize at this year\u2019s Berlin film festival) seems to operate in a lighter, breezier register than much of Petzold\u2019s previous works, which include the ambitious, labyrinthine second world war thriller <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/14/transit-review-christian-petzold-franz-rogowski\">Transit</a></em>, the Hitchcockian identity games of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/10/phoenix-review-noirish-game-cat-mouse\">Phoenix</a></em> and the mythic sub-aqua romance of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/23/undine-review-a-shaggy-catfish-of-a-story-about-a-woman-with-a-water-obsession\">Undine</a></em>. Of course, this is still a Petzold film, so for all the superficial frothiness, there are churning currents beneath the surface that toy with darker themes \u2013 questions of mortality, of the nature of the creative process, of the looming climate crisis, in the form of the forest fires that rage just beyond the horizon. Not that Leon is aware of any of this as he peers through curtains and around door frames, aggrieved and hostile, waiting to be disappointed. The delicious irony of the character is that, despite spending much of the film covertly and clumsily spying on the other characters (Nadja in particular exerts a fascination), Leon views the world through the prism of his own smarting ego. Which means he sees virtually nothing of the emotional charges and social dynamics around him.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/27/afire-review-slow-burning-german-drama-about-a-self-absorbed-writer\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/27/afire-review-slow-burning-german-drama-about-a-self-absorbed-writer", "date_published": "2023-08-27T07:32:05.334567+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": "The Guardian", "album": "The Guardian", "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Don\u2019t say the craic of doom has come for Ireland\u2019s pubs | Alex Clark", "description": "You don\u2019t have to be a big drinker to be worried by the declining number of bars in the republic.

Ainsworth, for instance, can\u2019t help basing a minor character on Mrs Touchet every now and again \u2013 be it as a dark-haired \u201cmystery woman\u201d in his first book of stories (\u201cShe was not, perhaps, what many might call beautiful, but I never knew anyone who possessed so much the power of interesting at a first look\u201d), or a certain Mrs Radcliffe in one of his late novels, \u201cwith her \u2018rich black tresses\u2019, decided opinions, Amazonian height and skill with a horsewhip\u201d.</p><p>In his mid-60s, Ainsworth has churned out a novel partly set in Jamaica, <em>Hilary St</em><em> Ives</em>, though he\u2019d never once visited the island. Mrs Touchet can trace back the gist of his knowledge about Jamaica to a propaganda booklet of the 1820s, when much of England could delude themselves into thinking that the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade in 1808 was tantamount to the freedom of enslaved populations in British colonies. Ainsworth ignored the regular reports of tragic rebellions and vengeful colonial reprisals coming out of the Caribbean in the decades since to paint a prelapsarian portrait of \u201clong savannahs fringed with groves of cocoa-trees\u201d. Eliza finds this entire business of borrowing, and omitting, recognisable details from life rather stale: \u201cFrom such worn cloth and stolen truth are novels made.

Holed up at home in Napa, California, during the pandemic, Coppola started to go through boxes of old material: Polaroids, early scripts, clippings, letters, doodles. These discarded objects had taken on a nostalgic quality over the years, and so Coppola put together the most meaningful mementoes from each project, accompanying them with musings and personal recollections. Speaking to journalist Lynn Hirschberg in the book\u2019s introduction, Coppola reflects on <em>Priscilla</em>, which premieres at the <a href=\"https://preview.gutools.co.uk/film/venicefilmfestival\">Venice international film festival</a> next month. \u201cAcross all my films, there is a common quality: there is always a world and there is always a girl trying to navigate it.

That\u2019s important for practitioners of what is, by all accounts, a dying art. Earlier this summer, executives at Sarson\u2019s, the chippy vinegar supplier par excellence, put out a gloomy press release warning that as many as half of the UK\u2019s fish and chip shops could be forced to close by 2025, as they struggle with soaring ingredient and energy costs. I will certainly be doing my bit to help out tomorrow: for me fish and chips and the summer bank holiday are indelibly linked, like turkey and Christmas. To drink with them?

In all cases, the decision about which wine to have with it is shaped as much by the container as the contents: practicality (weight, ease of opening, lowest risk of breakage) is what counts. A good thing, then, that the range and quality of wines available beyond the traditional 75cl glass bottle has been steadily improving over the past few years, with more drinkable wines than ever now available in a 25cl can.
