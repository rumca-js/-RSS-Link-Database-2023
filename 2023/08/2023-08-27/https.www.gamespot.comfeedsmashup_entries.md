<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4182271-septembergames2023.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>September, a great month to catch up on some much-needed sleep if you're Green Day and an even better month for anyone looking to dive into some new games across several different genres. While October is shaping up to be a juggernaut of new releases that we haven't seen the likes of in several years, September is no slouch with what it has on offer.</p><p>The most anticipated release of the month is easily Starfield, the Xbox Series X|S and PC exclusive that has been years in the making. Bethesda's big return to the AAA stage, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-release-date-requirements-and-everything-we-know-about-bethesdas-new-rpg/1100-6492368/">Starfield</a> is the biggest game of the current Xbox era, a massive tour of the universe in which players will be free to seek their destiny across the stars. Will you be an intrepid explorer sailing across the final frontier, a space pirate making a nefarious living, or a diplomat weaving between the politics of several factions? The choice is yours when Starfield arrives in early September.</p><p>For fighting game fans looking to indulge in some vicious brawls, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-2023-release-date-roster-characters-everything-we-know/1100-6514365/">Mortal Kombat 1</a> is sure to be a massive highlight. A semi-reboot of the franchise that charts new territory for the series while preserving its history, Mortal Kombat 1 looks like a bloody good time with its intriguing story, signature savage combat, and its steadfast refusal to believe that the letter "C" exists.</p><p>Another game to keep an eye out for is Baldur's Gate 3, which will be arriving on PS5 in September. After a successful launch on PC--and with an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-is-coming-to-xbox-this-year-but-no-split-screen-on-series-s/1100-6517181/">Xbox Series X|S version on the way</a>--Baldur's Gate 3 brings its magic to PlayStation 5, a game in which you can explore fantasy lands, fight titanic monsters, and punt a squirrel into bloody giblets if you manage to roll a D20.</p><p>On a lighter, but no less intense, note, EA Sports is headed to the pitch with the first entry in its new soccer franchise, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-fifa-is-no-more-say-hello-to-ea-sports-fc/1100-6513038/">EA Sports FC 24</a>. It's the start of a new series that is divorced from decades of FIFA games, but fret not soccer fans because you can still expect familiar gameplay, new enhancements, and tons of official club support in this game.</p><p>Other highlights this month include Cyberpunk 2077's ambitious expansion <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-release-date-gameplay-changes-and-everything-we-know/1100-6514048/">Phantom Liberty</a>, Bloodborne-like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lies-of-p-everything-we-know-about-the-pinocchio-souls-like/1100-6510117/">Lies of P</a>, and The Crew Motorfest.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Starfield - September 1 / September 6</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4181054-starfield.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>To paraphrase the late David Bowie, there's a Starfield, waiting in the sky! With the year more than halfway over, Microsoft is in dire need of a big win for Xbox, especially after Redfall proved to be a forgettable exclusive when it launched earlier in May. Enter Starfield, Bethesda's big space exploration adventure, which currently has a ton of momentum behind it. While the pressure is real, Bethesda looks set to create its next big franchise with a cosmic experience that could become a must-have game on Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p><div class="norewrite" title="6515106 - Starfield Preorder Deal Fanatical">    <div class="buylink__container">                                                                                                                                                                                               <div class="buylink__item">                  <div class="buylink__image-container clickable">                                            <img alt="" class="buylink__image" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4179501-starfieldgmg.png" />                                 <a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-100770772-13797872?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/starfield"></a>                              </div>                   <div class="buylink__text">                      <p class="buylink__title text-bold">                        <a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-100770772-13797872?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/starfield">Preorder Starfield for PC</a>           </p>                                                       <p class="buylink__deck">                          <a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-100770772-13797872?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/starfield">Save 17% on Steam keys</a>             </p>                                              </div>                  <div class="buylink__links">                                                                                                                                                          <a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-100770772-13797872?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/starfield">Use promo code FANATICAL17</a>                     </div>                         </div>                     </div> </div><p>Xbox Game Pass subscribers can get access to Starfield on day one for no extra charge, and you can start playing September 1 if you <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Starfield-Premium-Upgrade-Xbox-playable-until/dp/B0C7PL86M7?tag=gamespot-promos-20">purchase the Premium Upgrade</a>.

If you're looking for a strong single-player experience that combines classic Dungeons and Dragons fantasy with a choice-driven narrative, then this return to the Forgotten Realms is not to be missed. It has been rolling D20s since its full launch on PC, and if you're planning to pick the game up on PS5, you can check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-guides-hub/1100-6516431/">Baldur's Gate 3 guides hub</a> to help you get a head start on one of the best games of the year.</p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/baldurs-gate-3/">See on PlayStation Store</a> </div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Enchanted Portals - September 6</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4181059-enchantedportals.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Will we ever see a sequel to Cuphead? Anything is possible, but if you're looking for a game that appears to have copied Cuphead's homework, check out Enchanted Portals. As rookie magicians Bobby and Penny, you'll need to guide these two mages through a series of worlds, with the overall gameplay and charming old-timey art looking <em>exceedingly </em>similar to the adventures of Cuphead, Mugman, and Ms. Chalice. Still, the art direction looks great, and it looks like it could offer a fun time for big Cuphead fans.</p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2444350/Enchanted_Portals/">See on Steam</a> </div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Final Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis - September 7</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4181046-evercrisisff7.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Final Fantasy VII has essentially become a franchise within a franchise with a thousand stories to tell, with the latest being a mobile spin-off. Ever Crisis is a chapter-structured single-player experience that covers key elements of the Final Fantasy VII timeline, including both the original game, its spin-offs like Crisis Core, and more. Possibly the biggest draw here is that the game will explore the origins of Shinra's Soldier program, an event that will see players discover more about Sephiroth before his descent into villainy.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>NBA 2K24 - September 8</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4181056-nba2k24.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Another year, another trip to the hardwood in NBA 2K24. 2K's annual sports series has been a big commercial hit year after year, and for the 2023 edition, the studio says the basketball gameplay is more seamless, with a more fine-tuned attention to detail. As usual, you can work your way up from rookie sensation to MVP in MyCareer mode, but if you'd prefer a more nostalgic game of hoops, you can always assemble a team of legends in one of NBA 2K24's many other available modes.</p><p>You can save 17% on your PC preorder at GameSpot sister site Fanatical with promo code FANATICAL17.</p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100770772-13797872?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/nba-2-k-24-kobe-bryant-edition">See at Fanatical</a> </div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/NBA-2K24-Black-Mamba-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CBL3RPCC">See at Amazon</a> </div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet: The Teal Mask - September 13</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4176106-teal-mask.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The first of two major expansions for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet is almost here.

Some of the new features in this game include a series of short thematic campaigns that offer unique car culture experiences, an ever-changing program of activities, and of course, intense driving races and various competitive live events.

With fighting games making a big return this year, Mortal Kombat 1 is throwing its razor-sharp hat into the ring and unleashing its trademark ultra-violence in a new adventure that serves as a reset of the franchise.

CD Projekt Red has fundamentally overhauled Cyberpunk 2077 with this expansion, leaving virtually no aspect of the game untouched as it prepares to bow out and focus more of its efforts on a full sequel to this dark future playground of overpowered corporations, reckless body modification, and cyber-ghosts walking the streets of Night City.</p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-100770772-15232592?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.gog.com/en/game/cyberpunk_2077_phantom_liberty">See at GOG</a> </div></div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Infinity Strash: Dragon Quest The Adventure of Dai - September 28</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4181049-infinitystrashdragonquesttheadventureofdai.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Based on the classic anime series, this Dragon Quest spin-off puts you in charge of the hero Dai and the Disciples of Avan as they battle against the Dark Army.
