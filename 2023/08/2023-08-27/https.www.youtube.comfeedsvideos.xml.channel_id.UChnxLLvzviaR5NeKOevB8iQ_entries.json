It captures the alchemical and mysterious vibes of the Make Noise Strega and turns them up to 100, incorporating polyphony, space, texture, and distortion.\n\nAimed at cinematic sound design, horror, dark ambient, video game music and atmosphere, post-rock, and industrial, this pack rides the edge of beauty, horror, death, and rebirth.\n\nYou'll find pads, drones, leads, noise, sfx, atmosphere, and more. Each instrument is built with 8 macros to shift the sound in different and valuable ways.\n\nThis is for you if you like spooky scary, achingly beautiful, weird sounds.\n\nHelp the channel stay alive on Patreon: http://bit.ly/rmrpatreon\nTake a lesson with me: https://rmr.media/education\n\nFind my music here: \nBandcamp: http://bit.ly/2Kq617o\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/2N40SoX\nYouTube Music: https://bit.ly/3PZQ4ol\niTunes: https://apple.co/2pqh3SK\nAmazon Music: https://amzn.to/2O9q1fe\n\nConnect:\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/rmrtwitters\nWebsite: http://bit.ly/rmrmedia", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0l_1-ZuRiI", "date_published": "2023-08-27T20:32:18.427319+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Red Means Recording", "album": "Red Means Recording", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/A0l_1-ZuRiI/hqdefault.jpg"}]
