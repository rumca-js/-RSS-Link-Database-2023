Yes, he has a list of priors. Yes, this is in California. How'd you guess?</p><p>TikToker @michaela.witter was the first person to go public with the butt-sniffing. The man was creeping around the Barnes and Noble and following her. So she set up a camera to catch him lurking. Instead, he caught him sniffing.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

## Chris Pratt wrecks haters with hilarious 'pre-apology' to those who might try to cancel again him in the future

Assuming that he'll say something to offend woke twats he took to Facebook to make amends.</p><p>This comes from a post he made in 2015, after seeing how easily outraged everyone was with the Avengers (cough::<a href="http://comicbook.com/2015/05/22/new-captain-america-civil-war-logo-revealed-by-jeremy-renner/" target="_blank">Jeremy Renner</a>::cough) over comments made at various points of their press junket, but it's timeless. And when you consider how terrible cancel culture has gotten in the eight years since -- <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chris-pratt-haters-scripture" target="_blank">some of which was directed at Chris Pratt not for things he said but for things people assume he thinks</a> -- the actor was like Nostradamus.</p><p>"I am not in the business of making excuses. I am just dumb. Plain and simple. I try. I REALLY try! When I do (potentially) commit the offensive act for which I am now (pre) apologizing you must understand I (will likely have been) tired and exhausted when I (potentially) said that thing I (will have had) said that (will have had) crossed the line. Those rooms can get stuffy and the hardworking crews putting these junkets together need some entertainment! (Likely) that is who I was trying to crack up when I (will have had) made that tasteless and unprofessional comment. Trust me. I know you can't say that anymore. In fact in my opinion it was never right to say the thing I definitely don't want to but probably will have said. To those I (will have) offended please understand how truly sorry I already am. I am fully aware that the subject matter of my imminent forthcoming mistake, a blunder (possibly to be) dubbed "JurassicGate" is (most likely) in no way a laughing matter. To those I (will likely have had) offended rest assured I will do everything in my power to make sure this doesn't happen (again)."</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"></div><p>And in conclusion...<br /></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="22c08" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33009608&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>It used to be clockwork. The actor would do something that reminded everyone he exists, and some form of "cancel Chris Pratt" would trend on Twitter. Then Elon Musk fired the Twitter Curation team. They were the commie-as-f*ck employees tasked with curating what you saw trend. Now, it doesn't happen as much. Weird, right?</p><p>When it still happens on occasion, usually around the fact he practices one of the Jesus-based religions, he'll respond to the haters with a simple Bible quote or too. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chris-pratt-haters-scripture" target="_blank">And telling naysayers what to stick up their butts</a>.</p><p>Chris Pratt is simply one of our greatest living Americans. You can't change our minds. One day <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chris-pratt-nine-rules" target="_self">he'll drop scripture</a> while <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chris-pratt-meat-eats-vegan" target="_self">vacuum sealing the meat he just killed</a>. The next day he is Vince Vaughn's lawyer defending him against 142 paternity suits. The next day, he's a Lego. Chris Pratt is all of us.</p><p><p><em>The Louder with Crowder Dot Com Website is <strong>on Instagram now!</strong> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lwcnewswire/" target="_blank">Follow us at @lwcnewswire</a> and tell a friend!</em></p></p>

## School board punishes member for asking Facebook about "men using the girl's bathroom," so she's suing them

A board member was censured for literally doing just that. Now she is suing.</p><p>One day in August, Angela Allen, vice chairwoman of the Goochland County School Board, <a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/education/goochland-school-board-member-sues-colleagues/article_7ffe21a6-3ae4-11ee-bf8d-673b0b2be45a.html" target="_blank">asked an innocuous question on her Facebook page</a>: ‚ÄúAs a Goochland School Board member, effectively representing your interests is my duty. This week I learned that [Goochland County Public Schools] students are allowed to use restrooms different from their biological sex. Is this our community‚Äôs expectation?‚Äù</p><p>In case you haven't been following, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/high-school-riverside-fight" target="_blank">boys</a> claiming <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/girls-bathroom-school-board" target="_blank">to be girls</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/school-board-trans-bathroom" target="_blank">using both the girl's bathrooms</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/anti-trans-vermont-settlement" target="_blank">lockerrooms</a> has become a hot-button issue. After Allen posed the question, parents started showing up at school board meetings to ask questions of their own. That's what upset the other school board members. Parents showing up to public meetings? RUDE!</p><p>In May, five months after the scandalous post, the board censured Allen. The first censure in this school board's history too! Asking a question a Facebook rose to such a dire consequence.</p><blockquote>The censure resolution stated that Allen‚Äôs social media post was in violation of the board‚Äôs code of ethics, federal law and the U.S. Constitution. It also said Allen is ‚Äúaccountable for disrupting the integrity of the Board, encouraging violation of the law and blemishing the reputation of the board.‚Äù</blockquote><p>The school board -- the board of people who are responsible for directing your child's education -- declared a Facebook post in violation of both federal law and the U.S. Constitution.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="5a771" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=34892004&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>They are also upset that parents were encouraged to go to school board meetings. It caused a "disruption" when the board couldn't operate in secret and THAT blemished the reputation of the board. Not this censure, or passing a regulation that allows dudes to hang out in the girl's bathroom.</p><p>The lawsuit alleges Allen was the one who was defamed and is asking for both punitive and compensatory damages.</p><blockquote>‚ÄúThe defendants made knowingly false statements against Ms. Allen to disparage her reputation all because she exposed a policy they apparently wanted to remain hidden from their constituents,‚Äù Allen‚Äôs attorney Josh Hetzler said in a statement. ‚ÄúThese board members must be held accountable for wrongfully attacking Ms. Allen and for harming her reputation.‚Äù</blockquote><p>I hope she gets double what she's asking for. And the parents recall every school board member who called for the censure.</p><p>Though as the presidential election rolls on, I ask that you keep one thing in mind. Joe Biden and his Democrat Party agree with the school board members about parents daring to show up to public meetings and challenging officials.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

His breakthrough hit "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/oliver-anthony-story-behind-rich-men-north-of-richmond" target="_blank">Rich Men North of Richmond</a>" has over 11 million views on YouTube and keeps climbing. We'll get to Anthony's message in a minute.</p><p>Because also climbing are the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/rolling-stone-blasts-rich-men-north-of-richmond" target="_blank">expected media attacks</a>. You know, too many conservatives are enjoying something so corporate journalismers need to find excuses to dump on it. Only without much of a social media history to dig through (Anthony only joined X last week), they are getting desperate.</p><p>A popular attack is that he's not really a grassroots sensation because I guy with a following tweeted about him. You are only an overnight success if a record executive sees you performing in a Park Slope coffee shop and calls all their PR contacts to say nice things about you.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>The reason Anthony's song resonated with so many people isn't that he repeated stuff we believed back to us. You can collect tweets that do the same and match them with an electronic drum loop. It was the passion he sang with and the power of his voice. Nothing over-produced. A guy with a guitar and a microphone. That's it. If that doesn't move you, you don't have a soul. Or you are a corporate journalismer. But I repeat myself.</p><p>Anthony, moved by the love he's been shown in a massive way, asks an important question. When the song is forgotten about, what then? "What are the next steps to make life better for people? What can you do for your neighbor? I'm no Dr. Phil, but I just feel that in this moment in time when so many people are feeling the same frustrations, it would be wonderful to capitalize on that and just use that positive energy to help other people in your life. Maybe people that are different than you. People that you wouldn't normally connect with."</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Lol, spoken like a guy who has only been on social media for a week. Maybe that has something to do with it? </p><p>It's good for people to go touch grass once and a while. Talk to your neighbors or your kids' friends' parents. Shop local. Support little league. Log off once and a while and spend time talking to people IRL. That's what us oldheads used to refer to as "in real life." All of us live in a community or a neighborhood. Take care of it and take care of the people who live there.</p><p>Obviously, you should read and click everything we have for you here on the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website first! But THEN you should log off of the internet.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: Joe "Stranger Danger" Biden wants to take your kids for ice cream, refers to himself as "daddy"

And stop touching them." Looks like there needs to be another meeting. Biden took time out of a White House event to address the children in the crowd. And he called himself "daddy."</p><p>Why you would take your children within <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/old-man-inappropriate-biden" target="_blank">500 yards of Biden</a>, let alone to an event to celebrate the anniversary of the Inflation Reduction Act, is between you and CPS. And why Biden is celebrating the IRA when <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-inflation-reduction-act" target="_blank">he admits he lied about reducing inflation</a> (it ackshually increased <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/inflation-reduction-act-doocy-wh" target="_blank">both inflation and taxes on the middle class</a>) we'll save for another time. This is a post about stranger danger.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Wait, wrong clip. This is from yesterday's event. "I know some really great ice cream places around here, and daddy owes you ok? So talk to me afterward."</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>I'd like to think this is fourth-dimensional chess. And Biden only says things like this NOT out of a sense of creepiness or onset dementia, but because he knows how predictable and with little self-control we right-wing bloggers are. Kinda like how Trump says things like "riggers" (check X trends) because he knows how predictable and easily manipulated the media is. Which is ironic in and of itself since the Left and the media (but I repeat myself) know how predictable and easily manipulated Trump is.</p><p>But no. For Biden to even play 1D checkers it would require a brain that isn't 69% tapioca pudding. He told you -- a parent -- that he wants to take your kids for ice cream because he loves ice cream about as much as he loves the smell of seven-year-olds.</p><p>Ask yourself, is this an eighty-year-old man you'd let your children near?</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Won't somebody please think of the children? Joe Biden needs to be put into a home. Or left at the horse track with a note pinned to his sweater.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
