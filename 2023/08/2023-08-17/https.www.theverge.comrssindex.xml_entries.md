  <p id="cmWELb">Threads is adding reposts (aka retweets) to its reverse-chronological “Following” feed, Instagram head Adam Mosseri announced <a href="https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/CwDonFGuIPF">in a Threads post on Thursday</a>. It’s a small but nice addition to the app that makes the Following feed a bit more useful, and while Mosseri said Meta added it “based on your feedback,” the Following feed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/25/23807340/threads-following-feed-for-you-default-instagram-meta">does still have its flaws</a>.</p>
<p id="WIZLBW">That’s not the only repost-related update from Meta. It’s also rolling out a reposts tab on your profile so that you and others can more easily find the threads that you’ve reposted. I don’t appear to have either update yet on iOS, but I do have <a href="https://www.threads.net/@jaypetersplus/reposts">the reposts tab when I view my profile on the web</a>. (I think I need to repost more.)</p>

  <p id="odVXCG">The developer Relay for Reddit, of one of the remaining third-party Reddit apps for Android, detailed the potential prices for planned subscriptions for the app in a new post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RelayForReddit/comments/15twxmy/in_the_latest_release_of_relay_you_can_now_see/">on Thursday</a>. The costs of a subscription will go up based on a user’s daily average number of API calls, essentially meaning that the more things a person does in the app, the more they might have to pay.</p>
<p id="3fUFgk">In July, Reddit officially transitioned from a free to a paid API, meaning that developers would have to pay the company for accessing Reddit’s data for their apps. The change forced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23779519/reddit-third-party-app-shut-down-apollo-sync-baconreader-api-protest">many popular apps to shut down</a>, but a handful of developers, including the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/12/23758616/reddit-app-survive-paid-subscription-relay">one who makes Relay for Reddit</a>, said they might be able to continue making their apps if they charged a...</p>

<p id="U4vx9A">These kinds of podcasts play various types of relaxing sounds on a loop — like static, crashing waves, or rain — and they’re more popular than you may think. One of the reasons for their popularity is that Spotify has been unwittingly pushing them in front of users thanks to its “algorithmic push for ‘talk’ content (versus music),” according to <em>Bloomberg</em>. </p>
<p id="cB0FvO">The creators behind these “podcasts” make money off the ads that play during its episodes. Last year, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-01/how-to-make-money-on-spotify-a-white-noise-podcast-could-bring-you-big-bucks?sref=ExbtjcSG">a...</a></p>

  <p id="E9OhJ6">As promised, Activision showed off the next <em>Call of Duty</em> today after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23823042/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-release-date-activision">officially announcing it earlier this month</a>. So now, we have the first trailer for <em>Modern Warfare III</em> — which is a different game than <em>Modern Warfare 3 </em>(2011) — along with some details.</p>
<p id="NRjvKn">The new game features a single-player campaign that, naturally, follows <em>Modern Warfare II</em> and introduces a new kind of mission called “open combat” that Activision describes as “a new innovation that empowers player decisions like never before.” Players can supposedly choose different play styles — like stealth versus going in guns blazing — and the missions are designed to complement the more crafted, linear story missions <em>Call of Duty</em> is known for.</p>

  <p id="CPSTR9">Microsoft is preparing to close down its Xbox 360 Store and Xbox 360 Marketplace on July 29th, 2024. Xbox 360 owners will no longer be able to purchase new Xbox 360 games, DLC, and other content from the Xbox 360 Store next July, and the Xbox 360 Marketplace that includes avatars and games will also be closed to new purchases.</p>
<p id="25ie53">If you already own a bunch of Xbox 360 digital games, they’ll continue to be playable. You just won’t be able to purchase new games or DLC from an Xbox 360 console. Microsoft is also removing the Movies &amp; TV app from Xbox 360. This means “TV and movie content will no longer be viewable on your Xbox 360 after July 29th, 2024,” <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/08/17/xbox-360-store-will-close-july-2024/">explains Dave McCarthy</a>, corporate vice president of Xbox player services.</p>

  <p id="1nqF4k">AMD could reveal a new set of Radeon graphics cards as soon as next week. Scott Herkelman, AMD’s senior vice president, <a href="https://twitter.com/sherkelman/status/1691864001129443634?s=20">says in a post on X</a> (formerly Twitter) that the Radeon team will make some “major product announcements” at Gamescom (<a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-radeon-chief-confirms-major-product-announcements-at-gamescom-next-week">via <em>VideoCardz</em></a>).</p>
<p id="Aphlhn">While Herkelman didn’t specify what those “major” announcements could be, AMD is due to launch new Radeon RX 7000-series graphics cards sometime this year. During an earnings call earlier this month, AMD CEO Lisa Su said the company will reveal “enthusiast-class Radeon 7000 series cards in the third quarter” of 2023.</p>

## Red Dead Redemption works just fine on the Switch

  <p id="GNcgP9">Here’s some nice if slightly boring news: <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> runs just fine on the Nintendo Switch. That might not be too surprising given that it’s a port of a game that first released in 2010 and that the Switch has already proven capable of running large, slightly older open-world titles like <em>The Witcher 3</em>. But given developer Rockstar Games’ recent history with rereleases, some fans are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/aug/16/pushing-buttons-red-dead-redemption-rerelease">probably rightfully suspicious of this new version</a>.</p>
<p id="yw5ijt">I’ve played the first few hours of the <em>Red Dead</em> port on the Switch, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/7/23811044/red-dead-redemption-remake-rockstar-games-switch-ps4">which is out today on both Nintendo’s tablet and the PS4</a>. I’ve had the chance to get into one shoot-out, herd some cows, scare away chicken-stealing coyotes, break in a pair of horses, and watch plenty of cutscenes. And it feels...</p>

It has been gradually allowing users to uninstall more of them, and we’re getting to the point where most can be removed freely.

  <p id="MSz465">Valve’s Steam Deck might be getting more competition. Last month, <em>Windows Central</em> reported that Lenovo is working on a handheld gaming PC that runs Windows <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/pc-gaming/exclusive-lenovo-is-working-on-a-pc-gaming-handheld-called-the-legion-go">called the Legion Go</a>, and on Wednesday, <em>Windows Report</em> published what appear to be <a href="https://windowsreport.com/lenovo-legion-go-first-look/">the first images of the upcoming device</a>.</p>
<p id="6jJIfk">Based on the images, Lenovo’s take on a PC gaming handheld looks a lot like devices such as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23513517/steam-deck-long-term-test-valve">the Steam Deck</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23719210/asus-rog-ally-review">Asus ROG Ally</a>, but it also has a lot in common with the Nintendo Switch. According to <em>Windows Report</em>, the Legion Go has an eight-inch screen, images show two Joy-Con-like controllers that can be removed, and it even appears to have a wide Switch OLED-like kickstand that you can pop out for tabletop gaming.</p>
