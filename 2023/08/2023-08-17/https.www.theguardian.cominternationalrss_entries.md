## Forget Aaron Rodgers, Quinnen Williams is the star of the Jets’ Hard Knocks

<p>The HBO show understandably concentrates on New York’s new quarterback. But it is a younger player who produces the most excitement</p><p>As Hard Knocks openings go, Aaron Rodgers delivered an all-time classic for HBO’s 20th season of scenes from an NFL training camp. The New York Jets quarterback struts on to the field and mutters: “Gonna give you some good shit today.” It is trademark Rodgers: breezy, off-hand and ultra-confident. It is at this precise moment that Jets fans collectively respond: “We got ourselves a quarterback.” If they were smiling after the montage when Rodgers says their single Lombardi is looking lonely in the team’s trophy cabinet, one can only imagine their ecstatic expression after this brash assurance.</p><p>Well, that is unless they have never seen this hyperbolic roadshow before. This set piece along with every (and there are a lot) montage of Rodgers throwing perfect spiral after perfect spiral provides the archetypal opening gambit of Hard Knocks. The attempt to dupe us into mass Jets fever: that they are the best team in the league, never mind the numerous roadblocks on the way to February football. Of course Rodgers looks great throwing the ball because he is Aaron Rodgers, a Super Bowl winner and four-time NFL MVP.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/17/forget-aaron-rodgers-quinnen-williams-is-the-star-of-the-jets-hard-knocks">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The 2010s legal drama has broken records since hitting US Netflix, shining light on viewing patterns in a fragmented television landscape</p><p>Since I work in the business of talking television, I am often asking people what they’re watching. And this summer, the predominant answer – usually in the rushed, conspiratorial tone one takes when admitting a guilty pleasure – has been Suits, the glossy legal procedural which ran on USA from 2011 until 2019 and recently arrived on Netflix. My sister is watching Suits. My boyfriend’s mom is watching Suits. I am now rewatching Suits, a show I enjoyed ten years ago but mostly forgot about other than as a fantasy of sexy tailoring and the launchpad of one Meghan Markle.</p><p>I’m not alone; the show has <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/08/nielsen-streaming-ratings-suits-netflix-peacock-bluey-the-summer-i-turned-pretty-1235459890/">broken several Nielsen viewing records this summer</a> in the US and became Netflix’s most-watched acquired series in a single week, for a streamer that once had Friends, The Office, Breaking Bad and more in its library. Suits accounted for 18bn minutes of viewing on streamers in the month of July (which also coincided with <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/08/nielsen-the-gauge-july-2023-suits-streaming-boom-broadcast-cable-record-low-1235519506/">record-low viewing for linear and cable TV</a>, where Suits originated).

<p>The cost of borrowing will probably stay elevated for the foreseeable future, making it harder for governments to service debts</p><p>What a difference two years make. In 2021, when interest rates were near zero in the US and the UK and slightly negative in the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ECBDFR">eurozone</a> and Japan, the consensus was that they would remain low indefinitely. Astonishingly, as recently as January 2022, investors <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262544870/fiscal-policy-under-low-interest-rates/">put</a> the probability of rates in the US, eurozone, and the UK rising above 4% within five years at only 12%, 4%, and 7%, respectively. After adjusting for expected inflation, <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?id=REAINTRATREARAT1YE,">real interest rates</a> were negative and projected to stay that way.</p><p>In fact, despite the US Federal Reserve and other central banks’ aggressive monetary tightening, real interest rates remained significantly negative until late 2022. Moreover, <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?id=IRLTLT01USM156N,">long-term</a> rates increased more moderately than short-term rates: by October 2022, the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y3M">yield curve had inverted</a>, signalling that financial markets were expecting central banks to reduce short-term rates in the near future. This sentiment stemmed from the widespread <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/finance/3831323-resilient-us-economy-grows-2-1-percent-in-2022/">expectation</a> that the US and global economies would enter <a href="https://www.jeffrey-frankel.com/2022/12/24/the-global-economy-as-of-end-2022/">recession</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/aug/17/is-the-era-of-zero-interest-rates-gone-for-good">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Overtourism has long been a problem – and besieged cities are fighting back. But can angry locals stop the tide of stag parties, ‘anus burners’, noise and graffiti?</p><p>Ivan Bera, 24, has always loved the feeling of being naked. He says that when he was about 17, he “ decided to try it in public”, with his then girlfriend. Since then, “I have been very busy with the associations in Catalonia,” he tells me. The Catalan naturist-nudist scene is rich, decades-old and organised. Bera is a member of Joves Naturistes, which is for 18- to 35-year-olds; last week the all-ages Naturist-Nudist Federation of Catalonia made a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/aug/11/catalonian-nudists-campaign-against-clothed-tourists">public appeal</a> for tourists wearing swimsuits to stay away from their beaches.</p><p>“Legally, we can practise it everywhere: there is no law against nudism in Spain,” Bera says. “But most naturists prefer to practise it in secluded areas with a tradition of it. Those areas are being invaded, mostly in the summer months, by tourists who not only wear swimsuits, but also have a very disrespectful manner to nudists. We feel displaced in our own spaces and we fear losing them.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/aug/17/wish-you-werent-here-how-tourists-are-ruining-the-worlds-greatest-destinations">Continue reading...</a>
