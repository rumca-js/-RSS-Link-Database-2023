<p>Fresh security research from <a href="https://www.jamf.com/threat-labs/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Jamf Threat Labs</a> may not reflect an active attack, but it does illustrate the layered complexity of today’s threat environment.</p><h3 class="body">When Airplane mode isn’t Airplane mode</h3>
<p>In brief, the researchers have figured out a proof of concept attack that tricks victims into thinking they are using Airplane Mode. However, in reality the attacker has put in place a fake version of that mode that looks normal but lets the attacker maintain access to the device.</p><p>This is by no means a straightforward attack and hasn’t been seen in the wild. The exploit is complex and would require an attacker to successfully take control of the target device through a series of exploits, the research claims. </p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3705088/jamf-threat-labs-subverts-iphone-security-with-fake-airplane-mode.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>Hidden in the basic infrastructure that runs the US military is a powerful piece of Windows-borne Chinese malware that can disrupt the communications systems, power grids, and water supplies at the military’s bases around the world.
