Midway through the second half at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/13/chelsea-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">Stamford Bridge on Sunday</a>, with the score 1-1, Chelsea engaged in a spell of concerted forward thrust, and with Liverpool adjusting to a double substitution, Trent Alexander-Arnold pressed the damper pedal for a moment.</p><p>The whole thing took about 10 seconds. Alexander-Arnold walked backwards, looked around, feigned a couple of throws, using the moment as a peg to reset his team\u2019s shape, to let the lactic acid fade a little, to alter the balance of energies. The only really notable part of this sly but deceptively complex process, the football that happens in between the football, was the bit where Anthony Taylor came striding across to administer a thrillingly state-of-the-art booking, the card flourished with a kind of righteousness, a ceremonial rage.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/aug/17/time-wasting-in-football-is-ugly-maddening-and-absolutely-vital\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/aug/17/time-wasting-in-football-is-ugly-maddening-and-absolutely-vital", "date_published": "2023-08-17T18:48:47+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Five men found guilty of sexually exploiting two girls in Rochdale", "description": "<p>Abuse of girls, viewed as \u2018mere objects for defendants to use, abuse, humiliate then discard\u2019, started when they were 12 and 13</p><p>Two brothers are among five men from Rochdale to have been found guilty of sexually exploiting two girls from the ages of 12 and 13.</p><p>The girls were \u201cmere objects for the defendants to use, abuse, humiliate then discard\u201d, Manchester Minshull Street crown court heard.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/17/men-found-guilty-of-sexually-exploiting-two-girls-rochdale\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/17/men-found-guilty-of-sexually-exploiting-two-girls-rochdale", "date_published": "2023-08-17T18:48:19+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Ed Byrne: Tragedy Plus Time review \u2013 grief, regret and lots of laughter", "description": "<p><strong>Assembly Rooms, Edinburgh</strong> <br />In an affecting set, the comic reflects on his younger brother\u2019s death and the importance of holding loved ones close<br /></p><p>It is said that comedy is tragedy plus time \u2013 and it\u2019s taken <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/sep/13/ed-byrne-i-laughed-so-much-i-burst-a-blood-vessel\">Ed Byrne</a> time to address the death last year of his brother, the comedy director Paul.

Throughout the interview, Parkinson radiated empathy and understanding. He approached Burton with genuine warmth, without judgment. He understood the power of his platform and recognised that this was not just another interview; it was an opportunity to give Burton a safe space to share where he was in his life.

Decades earlier, Limato had been a confidant to the drag queens and \u201cfemme illusionists\u201d who frequented New York\u2019s underground joints such as 82 Club and the Cork Club in the 1950s and 60s, back when it was perilous and even illegal to cross-dress in public, and bars could be shut down if caught serving alcohol to a man in makeup. The queens, who labelled themselves the Boomatzas, wrote to Limato in fluent drag lingo, spilling the tea about what they had mopped, the current state of trade and the secrets of their pancake scene \u2013 terms that won\u2019t need unpacking for gen Z readers raised on drag brunches, RuPaul and Paris Is Burning.</p><p>Four years after Limato\u2019s death in 2010, these letters were found by Craig Olsen; he went on to produce the 2020 documentary P.S. Burn This Letter Please, which used new interviews with the surviving correspondents to create a moving portrait of the pre-Stonewall era where sisterhood flourished in the face of ubiquitous police brutality. Having helped bring the stories to life cinematically, Olsen now returns them to the page.
