## Microsoft is prepping new Surface hardware for next month

<p>Microsoft has invited reporters to New York City for a &ldquo;special Microsoft event,&rdquo; on September 21, most likely signaling a refresh of Microsoft Surface hardware against the backdrop of the most recent Windows 11 update.</p>



<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s playing it close to the vest; the invitation doesn&rsquo;t offer any clues aside from the Microsoft logo in a variety of colors. Microsoft hasn&rsquo;t provided a time for the event, either.</p>



<p>However, most Microsoft watchers know that the fall is when Microsoft unveils its annual (or semi-annual) update of Windows 11. Microsoft has been setting the stage with various updates looking ahead to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techadvisor.com/article/746304/windows-11-2023-23h2-update-everything-we-know-so-far.html&amp;xcust=2-1-2034937-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Windows 11 23H2</a>. The biggest update will be the inclusion of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1974843/windows-copilot-cant-decide-what-it-is.html">Windows Copilot</a>, a combination of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1808784/1808784.html">Bing Chat</a> and an assistant (<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2029475/cortana-is-dead-and-its-you-who-will-pull-the-plug.html">but not Cortana, sadly</a>) which will be able to tweak your PC after you ask it to. Windows Copilot hasn&rsquo;t been that impressive to date, but we&rsquo;re betting it improves by then.</p>



<p>The other aspect to the launch is the expected updates to Microsoft Surface hardware. Windows Central <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/surface/microsoft-announces-fall-surface-event-taking-place-in-september&amp;xcust=2-1-2034937-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">believes</a> that it will include the Surface Laptop Go 3 as well as the Surface Go 4, both of which cater to mainstream users. The sexiest addition could be a sequel to the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/538948/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-review.html">Surface Laptop Studio</a>, Microsoft&rsquo;s best device in years. A Surface Laptop Studio 2 should have an up-to-date Intel processor (hopefully 13th-gen or above) inside &mdash; fingers crossed that it&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1426371/intel-next-gen-meteor-lake-chip-tech-is-ready-now.html">Meteor Lake</a>. </p>

<p>With its comfortable keyboard, diverse connectivity options, and strong graphics performance, the latest Lenovo Legion 5 Pro model is the total package as far as budget gaming laptops go. This rig comes equipped with an Intel Core i7-13700HX CPU, the new Nvidia RTX 4060 GPU, 16GB of DDR5 RAM, and 512GB of PCIe SSD storage. In our testing, the Legion 5 Pro churned out a screaming fast 130 frames-per-second when running the <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> benchmark, which far outpaces most other laptops in this price range. The keyboard, which manages to squeeze in a number pad on the right-hand side of the tray, is impressive as well. It provide plenty of key travel and a rewarding tactile snap as you type. </p>

<p>For gaming laptops connectivity features are very important. Many folks like hooking up to an external monitor, mouse, or other peripherals and you don&rsquo;t want to have to buy an expensive dock to be able to connect everything. Luckily, the Legion 5 Pro offers excellent connectivity. It&rsquo;s rocking a USB-C port with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and 140 watts of power, another USB-C port with DisplayPort but no power delivery, and three USB-A ports. That&rsquo;s a total of five USB ports&mdash;virtually unheard of among today&rsquo;s laptops. The ports are mostly rear-facing, which is perfect for cable management when the laptop is sitting on a work desk, too. You really can&rsquo;t get much better than that.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re on the hunt for a budget gaming laptop that can really deliver, the Legion 5 Pro is the one to pick. </p>

<p>The HP Victus 15 is a phenomenal value for casual gamers. The price is more than reasonable and it&rsquo;s capable of running most games at 30 frames-per-second. The keyboard features an &ldquo;edge-to-edge design,&rdquo; which really &ldquo;makes maximum use of the laptop&rsquo;s interior.&rdquo; As for feel, key travel is long because of the deep chassis. Longer travel means less accidental keystrokes, which is what you want in a gaming laptop. A quick peek inside reveals an Intel Core i5-12450H CPU, an Nvidia GTX 1650 GPU, 8GB of RAM, and 512 of SSD storage. That&rsquo;s enough oomph for lightweight gaming. That said, given the specs, the Victus isn&rsquo;t going to hit 60 FPS in most games. If you can live with this limitation and are strapped for cash, then the HP VIctus 15 is a fantastic pick. </p>

<p>For those who would prefer to buy a laptop and have money left over for awesome peripherals, the Asus VivoBook Pro 15 OLED is a great option. It comes in at a few hundred dollars cheaper than other picks on this list and it still has good overall performance. It has a Ryzen 7 5800H CPU and a GeForce RTX 3050, which is enough to achieve decent frame rates on your favorite games while accomplishing all of your productivity tasks. But the true highlight of this laptop is the stunning 1080p OLED display with exceptional color performance and accuracy. It might not be the most exciting laptop to look at, but to get this kind of performance and an OLED screen to boot makes the VivoBook Pro 15 a great value.</p>

<p>Like something out of a cyberpunk dream, the Asus ROG Strix G16 sports all of the futuristic punk aesthetics you could hope for in a gaming laptop. It also features our favorite keyboard for gaming on a laptop yet. The full-size keyboard and trackpad are ideal for competitive gaming due to a host of programmable hotkeys, a creatively hidden numpad within the trackpad, and springy keys with a generous 2mm of travel.</p>

<p>The Asus ROG Strix G16 backs up its style with performance, too. It combines the latest-gen Core i7-13650HX processor with a Nvidia RTX 4060 GPU to give you plenty of horsepower. We were also thoroughly impressed with the gorgeous 16-inch, 2560x1600p, 240Hz refresh rate display. Sure, the chassis has a bit more plastic than we&rsquo;d like and the battery life isn&rsquo;t anything to write home about, but those quirks are soon forgotten when you boot up this neon-lit beauty.</p>

<p>The Dell G16 is a good option for both work and play. When it came to processor performance, it smashed the competition to smithereens. The Dell G16 nabbed the top spot in the PCMark 10 benchmark, which measures performance based on general use tasks like office productivity and video chatting. It also turned in 131 FPS when running the <em>Rise of the Tomb Raider</em> benchmark. You can thank the hardware for those numbers. It has an Intel Core i7-12700H CPU, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of PCIe NVMe SSD storage. The G16 isn&rsquo;t the sexiest-looking laptop we&rsquo;ve ever reviewed, but it gets the essentials right and that&rsquo;s what really matters. According to our tester, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;one of the most powerful RTX 3060-based laptops we&rsquo;ve tested.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gaming laptops aren&rsquo;t known for having the best battery life due to their power-sucking components. However, that&rsquo;s not the case with the Asus TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition. This thing is packing a massive 90 watt-hour battery, which lasted an incredible 11 hours during our testing. Of course, intensive gaming will reduce this significantly, but you should still expect to get around seven hours of continuous 1080p gaming without having to plug into an AC outlet. That&rsquo;s way better than most of the competitors on this list. That&rsquo;s an amazing result considering most gaming laptops will only last between three and six hours. It also has a robust chassis and sturdy overall design, meaning you don&rsquo;t have to worry about the occasional bump or knock while out and about.</p>

<p>The Asus TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition is no slouch when it comes to performance either. It comes with respectable hardware including a Ryzen 7 processor, AMD Radeon RX 7600S graphics card, 16GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. It scored very well in our <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> game benchmark tests, outpacing many more expensive competitor laptops. All of this makes the A16 an excellent option for 1080p gamers&mdash;especially those who want to enjoy untethered gaming on the go.</p>

<p>When you think of gaming laptops, Chromebooks might not be the first thing that comes to mind. But Lenovo has done a great job at making gaming accessible to Chromebook users with its IdeaPad 5 Gaming. It comes loaded with a Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, a 256GB SSD, and a bright 16-inch 2560&times;1600 display. Also, in a rarity for any type of laptop, the speakers are surprisingly strong.</p>

<p>If you want to game on a Chromebook, though, you&rsquo;ll need to do most, if not all, of your it through a cloud gaming service. This is because ChromeOS doesn&rsquo;t support most modern games. But for the monthly fee of a cloud gaming service, you&rsquo;re able to stream the very best modern games straight from the cloud to your Chromebook. In our tests we even found that we could stream AAA games at good resolutions and up to 120Hz on the Lenovo IdeaPad 5 Gaming Chromebook&mdash;that&rsquo;s not bad for a laptop that costs less then a third of what you&rsquo;d pay for a stronger Windows gaming rig. See our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/823826/best-cloud-gaming-services.html">best cloud gaming services</a> to learn about options.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>



<p>The PCWorld team puts each and every Windows laptop through a series of benchmarks that test GPU and CPU performance, battery life, and so on. The idea is to push the laptop to its limits and then compare it against others we&rsquo;ve tested. Below, you&rsquo;ll find a breakdown of each test and the reasons why we run them. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="windows-laptops">Windows laptops</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>PCMark 10</strong>: PCMark 10 is how we determine how well the laptop handles lighter tasks like web browsing, word processing, spreadsheets, and so on.</li>



<li><strong>HandBrake</strong>: HandBrake is more intensive than PCMark 10. It basically measures how long a laptop&rsquo;s CPU takes to encode a beefy 30GB file. </li>



<li><strong>Cinebench</strong>: Cinebench is a brief stress test of the CPU cores. It does this by rendering a 2D scene over a short period of time.</li>



<li><strong>3DMark</strong>: 3DMark checks if 3D performance remains consistent over time by running graphic-intensive clips. </li>



<li><strong>Video rundown test</strong>: To gauge battery life, we loop a 4K video using Windows 10&rsquo;s Movies &amp; TV app until the laptop dies.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-you-should-look-for-in-a-budget-gaming-laptop">What you should look for in a budget gaming laptop</h2>



<p>When it comes to picking the right gaming laptop, it really depends on what you want to do with it. Do you plan on playing lightweight indie titles like <em>Stardew Valley</em> (no shade, I love this game) or something more visually demanding like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>? Are you going to use the machine for work as well as play? It&rsquo;s possible to get reliable performance out of a gaming laptop that costs under a grand, but you&rsquo;ll need to take a hard look at the individual components. You don&rsquo;t need a powerful GPU for something like <em>Fortnite</em>. The guts, my friends. That&rsquo;s what matters.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>GPU</strong>: The thing about the GPU is that it can&rsquo;t be swapped out and upgraded later, so you need to be real choosy about which one you pick, as this component will determine how well your machine runs games. Luckily, you don&rsquo;t need the best of the best to get reliable gaming performance. The GTX 1650 is an entry-level GPU that&rsquo;s affordable and good enough for 1080p gaming with mid-to-high graphics settings. That said, expect lower frame rates on newer titles. If you&rsquo;re looking for a bit more power, we recommend opting for a GTX 1660 Ti or higher, or a more current RTX 30-series GPU. </li>



<li><strong>CPU</strong>: Like the GPU, the processor can&rsquo;t be upgraded either, so you&rsquo;ll want to be selective. For Intel, we recommend an 11th-gen Intel Core i5 or i7 or newer (13th-gen is now available). For AMD, you&rsquo;ll want to spring for a Ryzen 4000 or 5000. A processor with at least four cores is good, but six cores or more is better. </li>



<li><strong>RAM</strong>: You&rsquo;ll want at least 8GB of RAM. If you can afford 16GB of RAM, go for it. Memory is normally upgradable, so you can always swap it out and add more later on.</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: Storage impacts how many games and applications you can install on your laptop. Like RAM, storage is upgradable and can be swapped out later. However, you should aim for at least 512GB of SSD storage plus a hard drive, as AAA titles tend to eat up a lot of space. SSDs load games faster, as data is stored on chips rather than spinning disks.</li>



<li><strong>Display</strong>: 1080p is what you can expect at this price range. Budget gaming laptops don&rsquo;t always have the best displays, as that&rsquo;s where manufacturers tend to cut corners to keep the cost low. If you&rsquo;ve got a dim display, you can always pick up an external monitor to plug into. </li>



<li><strong>Battery life:</strong> Generally speaking, gaming laptops are known for having poor battery life. That&rsquo;s because they use a ton of power. They also tend to be heavier than other laptops because they need more space for heatsinks and other cooling components. Depending on the use, most will last anywhere from four to six hours on a single charge. That said, there are a few exceptions. The HP Envy 14 (featured above), for example, hit the 15-hour mark during our battery test.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="are-chromebooks-good-gaming-laptops">Are Chromebooks good gaming laptops?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>It really depends on the type of gaming you intend to do, but most likely no. Chromebooks can handle web games and Android games just fine. But if you&rsquo;re looking to play the latest high-powered AAA games, a Chromebook won&rsquo;t cut it, because a) it doesn&rsquo;t run Windows, and b) it probably doesn&rsquo;t have sufficient graphics power.<br /><br />With that said, Google is trying to bring cloud gaming to Chromebooks and it will likely be available in the future. Cloud gaming services use a remote PC or console to play games streamed through the cloud onto the Chromebook. Until that service is up and running though, Chromebooks will not be able to compete in the gaming arena.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="can-you-game-with-integrated-graphics">Can you game with integrated graphics?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Nowadays, the latest processors with integrated graphics can run quite a few modern PC games at reasonable settings. Intel&rsquo;s new Iris Xe line of processors with integrated graphics, for example, have been shown to run some of the latest games at 1080p and 30fps. Take note though, as not all integrated graphics are capable of the same things.</p>



<p>Intel and AMD&rsquo;s integrated graphics have made huge leaps in recent years with regard to gaming performance. If you&rsquo;re on a budget or looking for an ultra thin laptop with integrated graphics you can still enjoy some gaming as well. Check out our article about <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/633378/laptop-graphics-battle-amd-rdna-2-vs-intel-iris-xe.html">Intel&rsquo;s Core 12th-gen Iris Xe and AMD&rsquo;s brand new Ryzen 6000 RDNA 2</a> for more.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-size-laptop-is-best">What size laptop is best?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>This really comes down to personal preference and intended use. If you plan to travel a lot with your laptop, then a small ultraportable size in the neighborhood of 13 to 14 inches is best. However, if gaming is all you want to do, then something in the 15- to 17-inch range would be ideal. Also, don&rsquo;t forget to check the weight of the laptop before you buy it. Ultra thin laptops can weigh a featherlight 2 pounds while beefy gaming computers top the scales at three or four times that.</p>

## Let’s try to boost the Asus ROG Ally’s thermal performance

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Adam Patrick Murray is a man on a mission: Make the Asus ROG Ally perform better when the heat is on. He&rsquo;s already tried out <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnyiVOU9LPY&amp;xcust=2-1-2033642-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">re-applying thermal paste </a>to the handheld PC&rsquo;s AMD Z1 Extreme APU, with results that were conclusive, if less than dramatic. In the latest PCWorld YouTube video, he&rsquo;s back to try out suggestions from our viewer community, a few thermal paste brand and a pad with perfectly even application. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>After running baseline benchmarks and cracking open the retail ROG Ally unit, Adam disconnected the power, got the stock double-fan cooler off the primary PCB, and cleaned off the original thermal paste. He then applied <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Thermal-Grizzly-Kryonaut-Grease-Paste/dp/B011F7W3LU&amp;xcust=2-1-2033642-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Kryonaut Thermal Grizzly</a>, a popular aftermarket paste for desktop gaming PCs. He then re-assembled the Ally, did more benchmarks, and re-did the whole process, removing the Kryonaut paste and applying a custom-cut thermal pad, PTM7950. It&rsquo;s an interface material that stays in one piece for an easy, OEM-style application. </p>



<p>The results? Unlike the boost in thermal performance in the similar Steam Deck, the ROG Ally doesn&rsquo;t seem to get a huge improvement with new thermal paste alone. With the time and materials it takes to try this, not to say the risk anytime you expose a device&rsquo;s central processor, you&rsquo;re better off leaving your Ally be. </p>

<p>USB-C is the one connection to rule them all&mdash;literally, in many cases, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1341415/europe-sets-deadline-for-usb-c-charging-for-almost-all-laptops.html">thanks to a recent law passed by the European Parliament</a>. Its popularity has made USB-C a common sight on new monitors. A USB-C monitor can easily connect with a wide range of devices, from laptops to smartphones; and some USB-C monitors can even charge a connected device while in use.</p>



<p>The details of USB-C can be confusing, however, and pricing for USB-C monitors is often higher than that for monitors that lack the interface. Our guide to the best USB-C monitors will help you pick the right display for your needs.</p>

<p>The Dell U3223QE, which <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/811315/best-monitors-2.html">ranks as our best monitor overall</a>, is an excellent USB-C monitor with a huge range of connectivity. It also packs a cutting-edge IPS panel with alluring image quality.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Connectivity is excellent. The monitor has a USB-C port with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and up to 90 watts of Power Delivery for charging a connected device. It also drives a USB hub with a total of five additional USB-A ports, ethernet, and DisplayPort-out. That&rsquo;s enough to connect a wired mouse, keyboard, and display&mdash;and still have several ports left over for external drives or your smartphone.</p>

<p>This monitor is among the precious few with an IPS Black display panels. As the name implies, this technology improves black levels, offering roughly twice the contrast ratio of competing monitors with IPS panels. Very few monitors have this panel, so it gives the Dell U3223QE a significant edge over its competitors. The monitor also has 4K resolution and superb out-of-the-box color accuracy.</p>

<p>This monitor has a smaller twin, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dell-UltraSharp-U2723QE-27-16/dp/B09TQZP9CL?ots=1&amp;tag=pcworld02-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.pcworld.com/article/811315/best-monitors-2.html">Dell U2723QE</a>, which packs the same features and IPS Black panel at a lower price. It&rsquo;s a good choice if you don&rsquo;t want a huge 32-inch monitor or do want a USB-C monitor on a more modest budget.</p>

<p>The NZXT Canvas S27Q is the go-to choice if you want a USB-C monitor and don&rsquo;t need a wide range of USB-C hub connectivity. Its more threadbare feature set helps NZXT deliver USB-C connectivity and superb image quality for less than $350.</p>

<p>This monitor has a USB-C port with DisplayPort Alternate Mode, meaning it can handle video input. It lacks Power Delivery, however, so the USB-C port won&rsquo;t charge a connected laptop or tablet. The USB-C port connects to two additional USB-A ports. On the plus side, this monitor has two HDMI-in ports and one DisplayPort-In, for a total for four video inputs. Most affordable monitors have just two or three.</p>

<p>The NZXT Canvas S27Q is a 27-inch 1440p monitor with an IPS panel and a refresh rate of up to 165Hz. It also supports AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync, which is good news for gamers.</p>

<p>The monitor has excellent image quality and scores particularly well in color performance and accuracy. It can go toe-to-toe with competitors priced $100 to $200 above it, so it&rsquo;s a great choice if you want maximum value for your money.</p>

<p>The Asus ProArt PA348CGV is a spectacular ultrawide USB-C monitor. It manages to serve a huge range of people, from gamers to prosumers and professionals, without letting anyone down.</p>

<p>This monitor has a USB-C port with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and up to 90 watts of Power Delivery, so it can charge a connected laptop or table. The USB-C port can drive up to four additional USB-A ports, offering a wide range of physical connections. It doesn&rsquo;t support ethernet or video-out, however, so some owners will still need an additional adapter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Image quality is superb. Color accuracy is excellent, the color gamut is wide, and maximum brightness is high. The monitor&rsquo;s 34-inch panel has a resolution of 3440&times;1440, which is roughly equivalent to a 27-inch 1440p monitor and looks sharp in everyday use. The monitor has a maximum refresh rate of 120Hz and supports AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, which is good news for gamers.</p>

<p>The ProArt PA348CGV is reasonably priced, as well, at $729.99&mdash;not a bargain, but lower than most ultrawide monitors with similar features. Its price, wide range of features, and excellent image quality make the ProArt PA348CGV a great USB-C monitor for gamers and content creators.</p>

<p>The Dell Ultrasharp U4924DW is the best super-ultrawide monitor with USB-C. It offers outstanding USB connectivity, functioning as a USB-C hub with a total of six downstream USB ports (four USB-A, two USB-C) plus Ethernet and audio-out. The USB-C port also supports DisplayPort Alternate Mode and provides 90 watts Power Delivery, letting users connect and charge a laptop or tablet over a single USB-C cable. This eliminates the need for a separate USB-C hub or dock which, in turn, reduces cord clutter behind your desk.</p>

<p>Dell&rsquo;s U4924DW is a curved ultrawide but has a less aggressive curve than alternatives focused on gaming, which in turn makes it more suitable for work tasks. It also benefits from a sturdy, elegant design, a small yet effective stand, and VESA mount compatibility for both 200x100mm and 100x100mm mounts. The monitor also supports picture-by-picture and picture-in-picture modes that let users view two input devices at once. It&rsquo;s perfect for use in either a home or corporate office.</p>

<p>Image quality is solid, but the monitor has a mediocre 60Hz refresh rate and lacks support for HDR. The lack of these features is surprising given its $1,999 price point. Still, the U4924DW is a wise investment if you care more about productivity than gaming and entertainment.</p>

<p>The LG DualUp 28MQ780-B is a USB-C monitor with a unique 16:18 aspect ratio that&rsquo;s almost exactly square. It can rotate into a 18:16 aspect ratio if you&rsquo;d prefer. The monitor is much taller than most monitors and, as a result, has an adjustable stand that clamps to the rear of your desk instead of a normal desktop stand.</p>

<p>The monitor&rsquo;s odd form factor is ideal for viewing large, complex documents and can be useful for editing portrait or square photos. It&rsquo;s also well suited for use as a second monitor alongside a large 32-inch display.</p>

<p>The DualUp 28MQ780-B has a USB-C port with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and 90 watts of Power Delivery, so it can charge a connected laptop or tablet. The USB-C port can extend connectivity to two additional USB-A ports. Unfortunately, the monitor lacks ethernet or video-out, so some owners may need an additional adapter.</p>

<p>What about image quality? It&rsquo;s great. The monitor has great color accuracy, a wide color gamut, and respectable sharpness thanks to its resolution of 2560&times;2880. Just be warned: The odd aspect ratio makes it a strange fit for gaming and movies. This is a monitor built for work, not play.</p>

<p>The Viewsonic VP16-OLED is a remarkable portable OLED monitor that brings together top-notch image quality, USB-C connectivity, and an innovative stand design.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The monitor&rsquo;s 15.6-inch 1080p OLED panel delivers exceptional color accuracy, gamut, and contrast. It surpasses many full-sized OLED monitors and nearly all portable monitors. This makes it a great choice for productivity, though it also looks excellent when viewing movies or playing games.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The VP16-OLED&rsquo;s stand can be used as a kickstand or expanded to hold the monitor upright, making it ideal for professionals who want to maximize their workspace or need improved ergonomics. The stand includes two USB-C ports, both of which can provide power and video input to the monitor, and a micro-HDMI port for compatibility with non-USB-C devices. The monitor includes all the necessary cables as well as a USB-C power brick.</p>

<p>There is a drawback: the cost. The Viewsonic VP16-OLED&rsquo;s MSRP of $399.99 is expensive for a portable monitor. However, if you place a high value on image quality and want the best monitor for your portable office, the Viewsonic VP16-OLED is an excellent choice.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-to-look-for-in-a-usb-c-monitor">What to look for in a USB-C monitor</h2>



<p>Many features desirable in a USB-C monitor are the same as on any other display. A sharp, vivid, bright, and contrast-rich screen is best. However, shoppers who want to buy a USB-C monitor should keep an eye on details only relevant to USB-C.</p>



<p>Remember, too, that a USB-C display can be used in two contexts. First, you can connect your USB-C monitor to a desktop PC or laptop via a USB-C cable, and use it like a traditional USB-C hub via the USB-C cable&rsquo;s 20Gbps interface. That&rsquo;s pretty straightforward.</p>



<p>Second, you can also use the USB-C cable as a replacement for a display cable like HDMI or DisplayPort, especially for newer laptops that might eliminate an HDMI or DisplayPort port. </p>



<p>It&rsquo;s here that USB-C monitors can get tricky. The traditional rule of thumb is that a USB-C port can support a 4K display at 30Hz resolution. DisplayPort Alternate Mode (see below) increases that to 4K60, which is much easier on the eyes. Newer laptops use DisplayPort 1.4, which combines a high-bit-rate mode (HBR3) with a DSC compression mode that should allow for 4K60 video alongside the ability to use USB 3.1 storage devices. </p>



<p>Be aware, however, that the USB-C cable&rsquo;s 20Gbps throughput may not allow for video to be passed to premium displays like the NZXT Canvas S27Q at its full 1440p, 165Hz refresh rate. Those specifications probably assume that you&rsquo;re using a dedicated video port like DisplayPort, instead, as well as its separate video cable. You can certainly connect the display to your laptop using both a video cable and the USB-C cable simultaneously, however.</p>



<p>If your laptop uses either Thunderbolt 3 or Thunderbolt 4 or USB4 &mdash; all of which use a 40Gbps data connection <em>and</em> a USB-C port on your laptop &mdash; you should probably have no issues connecting your laptop to the monitor at the full refresh rate using a Thunderbolt cable. Just consult your laptop&rsquo;s specifications and/or manual to make sure.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="power-delivery">Power Delivery</h3>



<p>USB-C Power Delivery provides power over a USB-C cable. It&rsquo;s not part of the core USB-C specification, so devices with USB-C (including monitors) don&rsquo;t always support it. Power Delivery can pack up to 240 watts, but most USB-C monitors provide just 65 to 90 watts. It&rsquo;s a perfect fit for those who own a thin-and-light laptop, 2-in-1, or tablet.</p>



<p>Power Delivery is inadequate for some devices, such as gaming laptops, which consume more power than current USB-C monitors can provide. These laptops may still charge when left at idle but will charge slowly (or even discharge the battery) when in use.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="ethernet">Ethernet</h3>



<p>Wired ethernet is a desirable feature in a USB-C monitor. Many modern laptops lack a physical Ethernet port, so its inclusion on a monitor is convenient. It can improve the speed and reliability of a connected device&rsquo;s internet connection.</p>



<p>While useful, this is an expensive feature available only on premium models. The Dell U3223QE is the only USB-C monitor on this list with ethernet support.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="displayport-alternate-mode">DisplayPort Alternate Mode</h3>



<p>DisplayPort Alternate Mode is a feature available to USB-C that handles video as if the USB-C cable was a DisplayPort cable. It supports all the features you&rsquo;d expect from DisplayPort including high refresh rates and adaptive sync.</p>



<p>A monitor without this feature won&rsquo;t accept video over USB-C, meaning you&rsquo;ll have to connect both USB-C and a separate video input. All the monitors on this list support DisplayPort Alternate Mode.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-we-test-monitors">How we test monitors</h2>



<p>PC World&rsquo;s monitor guides are the result of independent tests by PC World staff members and freelance technology journalists.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We test each monitor with a SpyderXElite color calibration tool. This tool can measure a monitor&rsquo;s brightness, contrast, color gamut, color accuracy, uniformity, gamma, color temperature, and other important aspects of display quality. Using a tool that measures objective quality helps us objectively compare dozens of monitors.</p>



<p>Our tests of USB-C monitors also consider the range of USB-C connectivity and features available. We prefer to see a USB-C monitor with a complete range of physical connectivity including ethernet and at least 90 watts of Power Delivery, but these desirable features are balanced against the monitor&rsquo;s price.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Do I really need a USB-C monitor?</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>A USB-C monitor is a great way to expand your computer&rsquo;s connectivity without the added clutter of a USB-C hub or dock. It reduces the wires present on your desk, freeing up space for other uses. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/612470/you-should-buy-a-usb-c-hub-monitor-heres-what-you-need-to-know.html">PC World&rsquo;s guide to USB-C hub monitors</a> has the full story.</p>



<p>USB-C monitors are excellent when used with a USB-C laptop that consumes less than 90 watts of power at load. Docking a laptop at a desk can be annoying if you use a wired keyboard, wired mouse, and external monitor. A USB-C monitor can consolidate all your wired devices to a single USB-C cable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If these benefits sound good, then a USB-C monitor could be for you. If not, you may get more value from a conventional monitor.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Are USB-C monitors expensive?</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Yes, USB-C monitors are more expensive. Basic monitors without USB-C retail for as little as $100, while similar monitors with USB-C start around $150.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That price premium persists through all price categories. You can expect to pay around $50 to $100 more for a USB-C monitor than you would for a similar monitor without it.</p>



<p>Premium productivity and professional monitors are an exception. Nearly all monitors in these categories offer some form of USB-C support. They remain expensive, though, and are often priced between $500 to $1,000 (and sometimes more).</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Are USB-C monitors good for gaming?</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Technically speaking, USB-C monitors can be great for gaming. USB-C video is handled over DisplayPort Alternate Mode, which preserves all the usual benefits of DisplayPort. This includes great support for high refresh rates, high resolutions, and adaptive sync.</p>



<p>But there&rsquo;s a catch: Many monitors that have a USB-C port don&rsquo;t support important gaming features like an enhanced refresh rate, low pixel response times, or adaptive sync. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1346674/asus-proart-pa348cgv-review.html">The Asus ProArt PG348CGV, our pick for best ultrawide with USB-C,</a> and the NZXT Canvas 27Q, our best budget pick, are two notable exceptions. Just make sure that you&rsquo;re connecting to them with a dedicated DisplayPort or HDMI video cable, and not using the USB-C cable as the video cable, too.</p>

</div>


<p>Razer is the archetypal &ldquo;gamer&rdquo; brand, and at present it sells dozens of different keyboards. But they&rsquo;re all well, <em>gamer </em>keyboards, with a fairly narrow focus on that market. Aside from a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393376/razer-cleans-up-for-the-office-with-sleek-productivity-suite-peripherals.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">brief flirtation with &ldquo;office&rdquo; products</a>, the company hasn&rsquo;t engaged with the custom, boutique side of the market, exemplified by brands like Keychron, Drop, and Glorious. Until now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Going by its name alone, the BlackWidow V4 75% is just a slightly shrunken version of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1916318/razer-blackwidow-v4-pro-keyboard-review.html">the excellent V4 Pro</a>. But it&rsquo;s much more than that. As Razer&rsquo;s first keyboard with hot-swap switches, and filled to bursting with high-quality parts and features, it bridges the gap between gamer and custom keyboards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At an inherently middle-ground design, the V4 75% isn&rsquo;t perfect. Those wanting a &ldquo;pure&rdquo; gaming experience will probably be able to find a better deal, and those who want a more premium custom keyboard can get a more targeted option for around the same price. But if you find yourself torn between gaming keyboards and those that embrace a custom feel, it&rsquo;s an ideal compromise.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-features-does-the-blackwidow-v4-75-have">What features does the BlackWidow V4 75% have? </h2>



<p>Physically, the V4 looks similar to a lot of 75% keyboards, like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1915729/asus-azoth-keyboard-review.html">Asus ROG Azoth</a> or the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1502685/keychron-q1-pro-keyboard-review.html">Keychron Q1</a>. It swaps out the more typical dial for a horizontal one, a shortened version of the one on the right side of the full-sized V4 Pro, chopping down the pronounced media controls to just Mute and Play/Pause. Other than that, it&rsquo;s a familiar layout (only the right Shift key is shortened) in Razer&rsquo;s typical jet black.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>If you find yourself torn between gaming keyboards and those that embrace a custom feel, the BlackWidow V4 75% an ideal compromise.</p></blockquote></figure>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Razer BlackWidow V4 75% wrist rest" class="wp-image-2031663" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DSC05701.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>The keyboard inherited a few other traits from the V4 Pro, including a cushy, comfy wrist rest that weakly attaches to the main board via magnets, and RGB lighting that extends to the left and right side in strips (but not the rest). It&rsquo;s also wired, with no wireless option, something Razer <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/541284/razer-blackwidow-v3-pro-review-a-wireless-keyboard-with-gaming-audacity.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">dropped from the V3 series</a>, and still comes with ABS plastic keycaps instead of the more premium PBT.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Razer BlackWidow V4 75% case and layers" class="wp-image-2031665" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DSC05619.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>The rest of the design is all new. Razer took a good, long list at the most popular semi-custom keyboards, plus the current trends on keyboard communities. The result is a laundry list of premium and custom features. And here it is, because I don&rsquo;t want to bore you:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Hot-swap switch sockets&nbsp;</li>



<li>Aluminum body (top and two sides)&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>



<li>Gasket mount&nbsp;</li>



<li>PCB and body foam&nbsp;</li>



<li>PCB &ldquo;tape mod&rdquo; layer</li>



<li>FR4 (plastic-style) plate</li>



<li>Lubricated stabilizers&nbsp;</li>



<li>User-accessible case&hellip;sort of&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>So yeah, this is a sizeable departure from Razer&rsquo;s traditional design, while keeping most of the gamer elements it&rsquo;s been building up over the last few years. The hot-swap option is something that&rsquo;s a pure plus for pretty much anybody, unless you want rare and proprietary optical switches, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DHNX18W/&amp;xcust=2-1-2031075-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">as seen on the Huntsman line</a>. The gasket mount, internal foam, and &ldquo;tape mod&rdquo; &mdash; a popular aftermarket addition that Razer has essentially industrialized &mdash; are all aimed at making the typing &ldquo;feel&rdquo; more premium.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Razer BlackWidow V4 75% tape mod" class="wp-image-2031661" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DSC05660.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Razer  includes a pre-built version of the popular &ldquo;tape mod&rdquo; layer.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>But that&rsquo;s only half of the equation. The other half is the newly designed &ldquo;Razer Orange V3&rdquo; switches that come standard. Razer&rsquo;s made a big to-do about how much improvement has been made over previous designs, and interestingly, it&rsquo;s chosen tactile switches (small bump, no click) over the totally smooth linear switches present in most gaming keyboards. Again, this is based on feedback from the larger community.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-does-it-feel-to-type-on-the-blackwidow-v4-75">How does it feel to type on the BlackWidow V4 75%?</h2>



<p>So what has all this work achieved in terms of typing and gaming? Speaking as a mechanical keyboard nut, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s made a board that has a surprisingly good typing experience &mdash; and a shockingly good one for a board still very much aimed at gamers. The immediate improvement over other Razer boards, even the most expensive ones in the line, is immediately apparent.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Razer BlackWidow V4 75% hot-swap sockets" class="wp-image-2031660" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DSC05470.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>The aluminum deck combined with the foam and tape mod make the switches somewhat &ldquo;thocky,&rdquo; to use the jargon of the mech hobby. The slight bump is noticeable, but very smooth thanks to thick, rigid stems. It&rsquo;s not as deep, resonant, or dramatic as some of the multi-hundred-dollar builds from boutique sellers, but it&rsquo;s a definitely a leg up on just about any gaming-branded board out there. If it weren&rsquo;t for the Razer name and marketing, I&rsquo;d say this board is better for typing than for gaming.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">

</blockquote>



<p>All that being said, it&rsquo;s got a few points against it versus a more focused &ldquo;custom&rdquo; board like the GMMK Pro or the Keychron Q1. First, it&rsquo;s a plastic body &mdash; the metal is only on the top deck, plus the front and rear sides. You can see the plastic (complete with &ldquo;FOR GAMERS, BY GAMERS&rdquo; repeating text, in case you&rsquo;ve forgotten) on the bottom, along with the double-stage feet. That makes it significantly lighter than other 75% boards with all metal bodies.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Razer BlackWidow V4 75% side lighting" class="wp-image-2031659" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DSC05768.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>Second, Razer has chosen to stick with its Synapse software instead of the standardized, multiplatform QMK or VIA for programming. It&rsquo;s understandable &mdash; Razer has sunk a lot of resources into Synapse, including cross-platform syncing of the Chroma lighting with such diverse systems as Amazon Alexa and Phillips Hue. And as driver programs go, Synapse is probably the best on the market. But purists will still resent having to use proprietary software.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Razer BlackWidow V4 75% rear screw" class="wp-image-2031667" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DSC05572.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Despite the keyboard&rsquo;s custom aspirations, taking out that top screw will void the warranty.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>Lastly, Razer PR emphasized to me that the BlackWidow V4 75% was made to engage with the custom hobby crowd, with a body that can be disassembled by removing just six standard Philips-head screws. And indeed, this is the case. But the screw right beneath the USB cable has a telltale warranty sticker covering it. A dive into the user manual confirms that, indeed, your warranty is void if you open up the keyboard, even if no further modifications are made. That&rsquo;s far from the mod-friendly image cultivated by some of Razer&rsquo;s competitors in this space, and such an obvious disinclination to further customization has to count against it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-is-the-blackwidow-v4-pro-for-gaming">How is the BlackWidow V4 Pro for gaming?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>As I said previously, the excellent tactile Orange V3 switches almost make the BlackWidow V4 75% more suited to typing than to gaming. But if you want it for the latter &mdash; and I have to assume that a lot of Razer enthusiasts do &mdash; you won&rsquo;t find it lacking.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Razer BlackWidow V4 75% orange switches" class="wp-image-2031664" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DSC05496.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>As with most of Razer&rsquo;s recent keyboards, it&rsquo;s completely customizable in Synapse, can be loaded with offline profiles in local memory, and can program macros on the fly. It has 8,000Hz polling, far more than any human being can actually make use of, and quick &ldquo;game modes&rdquo; disable the Windows button, Alt-Tab, and Alt-F4. Though once again there are a few buttons that are off-limits for programming, including Win, Fn, and the play/pause button.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Razer BlackWidow V4 75% media controls" class="wp-image-2031662" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DSC05722.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>The V4&rsquo;s super-comfy wrist rest makes extended gaming sessions a breeze, and I think some gamers may prefer the smaller, backpack-friendly size (not to mention the lighter plastic body) versus the full-sized V4 Pro. And yes, the lighting does look very pretty, especially with the side strips &mdash; I&rsquo;m partial to the &ldquo;fire&rdquo; preset that makes it glow like a Christmas fireplace.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-does-the-blackwidow-v4-pro-compare-for-value">How does the BlackWidow V4 Pro compare for value?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Here&rsquo;s where things get interesting for the BlackWidow V4 75%. At $190, it&rsquo;s $40 less than the much larger, heavier V4 Pro. And considering all the engineering and extra parts that went into the design, I&rsquo;d say that&rsquo;s more than fair. But how does it compare to similar keyboards from the competition?&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a wired, gaming-focused 75% board that swings for the &ldquo;custom&rdquo; crowd, I&rsquo;d say the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09WRSX7JX/&amp;xcust=2-1-2031075-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Glorious GMMK Pro</a> is the closest model to compare it to. It also has side lighting and a nice wrist rest, and comes with a nearly identical layout and set of features, minus the &ldquo;tape mod,&rdquo; but with a custom break-away cable and a full aluminum body. For these luxuries, Glorious asks $350. Razer&rsquo;s a clear and dramatic winner in terms of value, and depending on your tastes, its more gaming-focused software and much faster polling may make it an outright winner anyway.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Razer BlackWidow V4 75% lighting" class="wp-image-2031657" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DSC05800.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>The V4 75% also competes with the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1915729/asus-azoth-keyboard-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Asus ROG Azoth</a>, which includes wireless capabilities, a full metal frame, an OLED screen, and a switch lubing kit, even if it is rather barebones. But I found the screen a poor replacement for a standard dial with very little practical use, and Asus&rsquo; gaming software is abysmal. Razer&rsquo;s a clear winner unless you can&rsquo;t live without high-speed wireless.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Which brings up the most interesting comparison: the Keychron Q1. I reviewed the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1502685/keychron-q1-pro-keyboard-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">wireless Pro version</a> of this board, and it <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1966306/best-mechanical-keyboards.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">remains our top overall pick</a> for pure mechanical keyboards, but the wired-only board is a more direct match for Razer here. At <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-q1?variant=40316012658777&amp;xcust=2-1-2031075-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">$189 for the fully assembled knob version</a>, it has a slight advantage in price, comes with RGB lighting (sans side strips), full PBT keycaps, gasket mounting, and a full aluminum body. All it&rsquo;s missing in the hardware feature list is Razer&rsquo;s 8,000Hz polling, the built-in &ldquo;tape mod,&rdquo; and that very cushy wrist rest&hellip;but Keychron has chosen to make its keyboards programmable with VIA and QMK. And perhaps more pertinently, there&rsquo;s no warranty issue just for opening it up, and comes with an Allen wrench included for just that purpose.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Razer BlackWidow V4 75% and Keychron Q1 Pro" class="wp-image-2031658" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DSC05813.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>Razer BlackWidow V4 75%, left, and Keychron Q1 Pro, right</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>I&rsquo;m prepared to call this a wash. Those who want a keyboard for pure gaming prowess and some light custom options will be happier with the BlackWidow V4 75%, even with its somewhat low-rent ABS keycaps and lighter plastic body. Those who want to go all-out on the custom side of things will get more bang for their buck with the Keychron, which is still perfectly serviceable for gaming if not so <s>razor-</s> laser-focused on it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The BlackWidow V4 75% is a great keyboard, and a huge step forward for Razer</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>All rambling comparisons aside, the BlackWidow V4 75% is a great keyboard, and a huge step forward for Razer. I wish it came with PBT keycaps, and offered an option for programming aside from Synapse. But as a gaming keyboard it&rsquo;s incredibly comfortable and satisfying to use. It&rsquo;s an excellent choice if you want great gaming and typing with the option to dip your toes in the custom keyboard craze, or just want a more premium option that maintains Razer&rsquo;s gaming heritage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve been waiting for mid-range Radeon RX 7000 series graphics cards, your wait is almost over&hellip;or at least, your wait for their official confirmation. According to a Twitter post from an AMD vice president, the company is planning a big reveal at Gamescom in Germany on August 25th. That would be an ideal time to announce <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2016950/amd-says-mid-range-radeon-7000-cards-will-be-here-soon.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">those new &ldquo;enthusiast&rdquo; GPUs</a> the company is planning to release sometime this quarter, if what CEO Lisa Su told investors holds true. </p>

Both models fill in some much-needed slots on AMD&rsquo;s roster between the budget RX 7600 and premium RX 7900 XT GPUs. </p>



<p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amd.com/de/corporate/events/gamescom-2023.html#schedule&amp;xcust=2-1-2034540-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">An AMD promotional page</a> says that the &ldquo;AMD Highlight Show&rdquo; at Gamescom will begin at 5:00 PM, Cologne time, which is 11 AM Eastern and 8 AM Pacific in the United States. Naturally, PCWorld will have coverage of all the news as it comes in&hellip;assuming that AMD&rsquo;s manufacturing partners haven&rsquo;t spilled the rest of the beans in the next week. In particular, we&rsquo;re still waiting on retail prices for these mid-range cards. </p>

## Windows 11 will let you delete more built-in apps soon

<p>Microsoft has been filling up Windows builds with questionably necessary add-on programs for decades, and for just as long, power users have been stripping them out. Some have gone so far as to create custom installation media with trimmed-down builds. But in an upcoming Windows 11 release, you won&rsquo;t need to go to such drastic lengths, at least for some of the most common occupants of the cutting room floor. A new Windows Insider build lets users remove more default apps without any third-party tools. </p>



<p>In particular, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/08/16/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-25931-canary-channel/&amp;xcust=2-1-2034485-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Canary build 25931</a> lets users uninstall the default Windows programs Camera, Photos, People, and the Remote Desktop Client via the default uninstall interface in Settings, as well as the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2018918/microsoft-begins-pulling-the-plug-on-cortana.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">recently decommissioned Cortana virtual assistant</a>. As <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/17/23835550/microsoft-windows-11-uninstall-built-in-inbox-apps&amp;xcust=2-1-2034485-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Verge notes</a>, the option to remove the default Camera app has been around in other preview builds for a little while. Other notable changes in this Canary release include updated Unicode Emoji 15 support and more universal voice access tools. </p>



<p>All of these programs (minus Cortana) have popular third-party alternatives available, such as <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/486954/eight_excellent_free_downloads.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">IrfanView</a> and Paint.NET for Photos or <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/search?q=chrome+remote+desktop#gsc.tab=0&amp;gsc.q=chrome%20remote%20desktop&amp;gsc.page=1">Chrome Remote Desktop</a> for Microsoft&rsquo;s MSTSC program, so users who have their own preferences can save a little bloat. I&rsquo;ll be keeping the Camera app around just as a quick way of checking my hair before I hop in a Zoom call. Precisely when these options will make their way to the release version of Windows isn&rsquo;t known, but based on previous Windows Insider progression I&rsquo;d expect to see them before the end of the year. </p>

## You can now stream your gameplay to Microsoft Teams

<p>If you&rsquo;re streaming your gameplay to a group of friends and/or family, there&rsquo;s a new option in town: Microsoft Teams. Yes, you read that right. Microsoft has added a new integration for the Xbox Game Bar that allows livestreaming to the company&rsquo;s business-focused chat and video-calling app.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/16/23834413/microsoft-teams-xbox-game-bar-live-stream-feature&amp;xcust=2-1-2033720-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">The Verge</a>, a new <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/microsoft-teams-play-together/9N8GQJQWSPPH&amp;xcust=2-1-2033720-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">&ldquo;Microsoft Teams Play Together&rdquo; widget</a> enables the integration in Windows. Once you install it via the Microsoft Store app, you can share your desktop to Teams, allowing your friends to watch your game. You can also join video calls while playing, which lets you see friends and family as an overlay on your game. Up to 20 people can be in a call at one time.</p>



<p>You might assume this feature was originally intended for work purposes, but it&rsquo;s truly meant to have a gaming bent. Microsoft says this integration enables &ldquo;a place to hang out while watching and playing games.&rdquo; As you might recall, rumors circulated back in 2021 about <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394288/report-microsoft-is-in-talks-to-buy-discord-for-over-10-billion.html">Microsoft potentially acquiring Discord</a>, but a buyout never happened. Instead, it appears Microsoft crafted its own take on Discord&rsquo;s most popular features.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Teams Play Together Xbox Game Bar interface" class="wp-image-2034026" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ms-teams-play-together.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>Starting a Microsoft Teams streaming session through the Xbox Game Bar is simple and straightforward.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>But unfortunately for Microsoft, the initial launch appears to fall short of rival services&mdash;when The Verge tried out the new Teams integration, the frame rates ran at 30fps or lower. Meanwhile, Twitch caps at 1080p/60fps, YouTube allows 4K/60fps, and though Discord&rsquo;s free streaming is restricted to 720p/30fps, its paid Nitro subscribers can go up to 4K/60fps. The video overlay feature also did not seem to work properly yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The integration doesn&rsquo;t currently allow streaming from just specific apps, either. Your whole desktop (or at least, a whole display, if you have more than one monitor) gets transmitted for everyone to see. You&rsquo;ll have to be careful to avoid accidentally showing what you&rsquo;ve got open in your windows, if it&rsquo;s a concern.</p>



<p>Microsoft may be facing an uphill battle in wooing gamers and their friends from Discord and other services. It&rsquo;d be a different story if the feature was in Skype instead. Only those stuck using Teams will find this worthwhile, and that&rsquo;s likely just people at work on locked-down corporate PCs. But even then, work-issued equipment for personal use is always a dicey proposition. While tech giants keep adding consumer features to their business apps, those of us in the trenches are usually under strict command by IT departments to never mix the two purposes.</p>

</div><h3 class="review-price" id="price-when-reviewed">Price When Reviewed</h3><p>40 Euro</p>


<p>The more careless software developers are with the setup routines of their programs, the more important a reliable uninstaller is. That&rsquo;s because file remnants and registry entries often linger when programs are removed using the native Windows uninstall options. These ghosts not only clutter up your storage drive, but in the worst cases they cause error messages and make Windows itself unstable.</p>



<p>Ashampoo Uninstaller 12 counters the problem with several features designed to thoroughly uninstall all traces of unwanted software.</p>



<p>Directly after the installation and first start of Ashampoo&rsquo;s software, you can scroll through the individual areas and, for example, remove programs, Windows apps, and browser extensions from Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Opera. The batch mode is helpful here: You make your selection and after clicking on <em>Uninstall</em>, all the chosen programs are cleaned from your drive, one after the other.</p>



<p>The Install mode proves to be very helpful: If you install software with its help, Uninstaller 12 can also remove it completely again for a virtually pore-deep clean. </p>



<p>We also like the numerous extras. Snapshots can be used to record and compare system states. In addition, the system can be analyzed to find particularly active and resource-hungry programs. The other included utilities from the large Ashampoo toolbox are wonderfully practical. You can use them to optimize the registry, manage services and autostart, safely delete and archive files, and clean up your PC extensively.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.ashampoo.com/en-us/uninstaller&amp;xcust=2-1-2020932-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Ashampoo Uninstaller 12</a> quickly and reliably removes programs, Windows apps, and browser extensions. With the helpful batch mode feature you can select several applications at once, which the Ashampoo program then cleans from your hard drive in one go. The numerous tools in the toolbox are also helpful. At $40, Ashampoo Uninstaller is a bit expensive, but if you spend a lot of time adding and removing programs on your PC, it could be worth the money.</p>

<p>Current CPUs from AMD and Intel now support RAM with quite fast clock rates: up to 3200MHz with DDR4 RAM and 5600MHz with DDR5. Furthermore, higher clock frequencies are no longer unusual&mdash;in these cases, the use of a special profile allows the correct control of the RAM. However, to get these clock rates, you have to adjust a setting in the BIOS (alternative: manual overclocking). We have tested for you how much the clock rate and the latency of the RAM affect the gaming performance of your computer.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="how-is-the-maximum-supported-ram-clock-determined">How is the maximum supported RAM clock determined?</h2>



<p>The stated values for the maximum RAM clock often differ greatly between processor providers and motherboard manufacturers. To ensure the long-term, stable use of a computer, there are specifications for RAM from <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.jedec.org&amp;xcust=2-1-2030982-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">JEDEC</a>, an organization for the standardization of semiconductors. These concern, for example, the memory clock or the supply voltage. To ensure maximum stability, CPU developers follow these guidelines. In the following table we have compiled for you the latest CPU generations from AMD and Intel, including the RAM clock rates specified by the manufacturers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><thead><tr><th><strong>CPU socket</strong></th><th><strong>Processor type</strong></th><th><strong>Supported RAM clock</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th>Intel 1700</th><th><strong>Core i5/i7/i9-13000</strong></th><th><strong>3200 MHz DDR4, 5600 MHz DDR5</strong></th></tr><tr><td><p>Intel 1700  </p></td><td><p>Core i3/i5/i7/i9-12000<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">, Pentium Gold, Celeron, Core i3/i5-13000</span></p></td><td><p>3200 MHz DDR4, 4800 MHz DDR5</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Intel 1200  </p></td><td><p>Core i5/i7/i9-11000  </p></td><td><p>3200 MHz</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Intel 1200</p></td><td><p>Core i7/i9-10000  </p></td><td><p>2933 MHz  </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Intel 1200</p></td><td><p>Core i3/i5-10000, Pentium Gold, Celeron G </p></td><td><p>2666 MHz  </p></td></tr><tr><td>Intel 4677</td><td>Xeon w-3400, Xeon w-2400</td><td>4800 MHz DDR5</td></tr><tr><td><p>Intel 2066</p></td><td><p>Core i9-10000</p></td><td><p>2933 MHz</p></td></tr><tr><td>AMD AM5</td><td>Ryzen 5/7/9</td><td>5200 MHz DDR5</td></tr><tr><td><p>AMD AM4</p></td><td><p>Ryzen 3/5/7/9 3000, Ryzen 3/5/7 4000, Ryzen 5/7/9 5000</p></td><td><p>3200 MHz</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>AMD AM4</p></td><td><p>Ryzen 3/5/7 2000<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-weight: inherit; background-color: unset;">, Ryzen 3/5 3000G</span></p></td><td><p>2933 MHz</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>AMD AM4</p></td><td><p>Ryzen 3/5/7 1000, Athlon</p></td><td><p>2666 MHz</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>AMD AM4</p></td><td><p>A-9000</p></td><td><p>2400 MHz</p></td></tr><tr><td>AMD sWRX8</td><td>Ryzen Threadripper PRO 3000, Ryzen Threadripper PRO 5000</td><td>3200 MHz</td></tr><tr><td><p>AMD sTRX4</p></td><td><p>Ryzen Threadripper 3000  </p></td><td><p>3200 MHz</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>On many available motherboards, the maximum RAM clock listed is significantly higher than the above values. The easiest way to clock the RAM higher is to use the so-called &ldquo;XMP&rdquo; (Extreme Memory Profile) for Intel, or &ldquo;EXPO&rdquo; (Extended Profiles for Overclocking) for AMD. </p>



<p>The manufacturers of memory sticks and motherboards specify higher maximum RAM clock rates in these profiles. This is often accompanied by an increase in the supply voltage. Even if the manufacturers carry out extensive tests for this, you do not receive an absolute guarantee regarding compatibility and stability. This means that if you plan to use a PC 24/7, it is not recommended to activate such a profile. (On AMD motherboards, instead of XMP for DDR4 modules, the name &ldquo;D.O.C.P.&rdquo; (Direct Over Clock Profile) is common.)</p>



<p>To get the maximum data throughput, note how many memory channels the motherboard used supports. This number indicates how many working memory blocks the processor, or more precisely the memory controller, can address in parallel. Most motherboards use a dual-channel architecture. In this case, you get a significant performance boost with two RAM modules as opposed to a single memory bar.</p>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-box-text inline-box">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="ram-frequency-and-latencies-explained">RAM: frequency and latencies explained</h2>



<p>RAM (Random Access Memory) is something like the short-term memory of your PC. All data and commands that the CPU needs to run a program are stored temporarily in the RAM. The advantage over retrieving data directly from the system memory, such as an HDD or SSD, is the significantly shorter access time and the higher transfer rate.</p>



<p>A memory bar is made up of several memory chips, which in turn consist of millions of small capacitors and transistors. Each memory cell corresponds to one bit and can assume either the status 1 (charged) or 0 (discharged). Since capacitors discharge again, the state is constantly refreshed. The transistors are responsible for restoring or changing the state of a capacitor.  </p>



<p>The memory cells are arranged in a grid with rows and columns like in an Excel spreadsheet, which allows the memory controller to address each cell precisely. This is where the name &ldquo;random access memory&rdquo; comes from. When accessing a single memory cell, various latency times occur, each of which is specified in clock cycles and thus depends on the frequency of the main memory.</p>



<p>First, the memory controller activates the desired row and sends a read command. This latency is called tRCD = Row-to-Column Delay, which corresponds to the access time from one row to one column. Next comes the actual access time: CL = CAS Latency, which indicates the time span between the read command and the arrival of the desired data or, in other words, the access time to a column. The read row is then deactivated. The entire cycle from activation to reading with data output and deactivation is described by the time tRAS = Active-to-Precharge Time. To reactivate the corresponding row, the time tRP = Row Precharge Time elapses. This is how many cycles must pass before the same row can be accessed again.</p>



<p>The actual elapsed time can be calculated via the frequency of the memory module. Let&rsquo;s take a DDR4 RAM module with 4000MHz and latencies of CL17-17-17-37 as an example. First we calculate the reciprocal of the effective clock frequency, i.e. 1 divided by 4000MHz. We multiply this value by two (factor of two because DDR = Double Data Rate) and the number of past clock cycles, i.e. the CAS latency of 17. This gives us the actual latency of 0.0085 microseconds, or 8.5 nanoseconds. The value for tRP, on the other hand, is 18.5 nanoseconds. </p>



<p>The reason for the factor of two lies in the name DDR (Double Data Rate). Here, the transmission of data bits takes place on both rising and falling edges, i.e. twice per clock cycle. A further increase in the data throughput of DDR SDRAM is provided by the so-called burst mode. This enables the memory controller to read or change several consecutive cells in one line. This eliminates the first step, i.e. the activation of the corresponding row with the subsequent read command. In addition, DDR4 RAM has eight data buffers (prefetch factor) in which data from burst accesses are temporarily stored.</p>



<p>DDR4 memory modules have a single 64-bit channel (72-bit if we also consider ECC here). DDR5 memory modules, on the other hand, are equipped with two independent 32-bit channels (40-bit with ECC). JEDEC also doubled the so-called burst length from eight bytes (BL8) to 16 bytes (BL16). These changes improve efficiency and reduce latency when accessing data. In a dual DIMM setup, this essentially makes DDR5 a four times 32-bit configuration instead of the traditional twice 64-bit configuration of DDR4.</p>
</div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="ddr5-how-much-extra-performance-does-xmp-or-expo-bring-in-games">DDR5: How much extra performance does XMP or EXPO bring in games? </h2>



<p>Only in certain applications does a high RAM clock actually bring advantages. These include encrypting files, (de)compressing with packing program, or video editing. This is because memory access here is sequential and the RAM can thus benefit from burst mode and data prefetch. However, if many commands with small data packets occur in a short time, then low latency is more important than a higher RAM clock. In PC games, it is primarily the performance of the graphics card that counts, as this is the limiting factor in most cases. Only when the PC is at its processor limit can it benefit significantly from faster RAM.</p>

For the test, two 16GB modules were used in combination with an RTX 4090, and all tests were carried out in 1080p in order to test in the CPU limit as far as possible.</p>

<p>For both AMD processors, the RAM was operated at a maximum of 6000MHz, as the new AM5 firmware AGESA 1.0.0.7 was not yet available at the time of the test, which for the first time with the Ryzen 7000 processors also allows significantly higher clock rates for the RAM. For the Intel CPU, the YouTuber also provides measurement results with 7200MHz.</p>



<p>The video shows well that the performance gain depends strongly on the selected game. In <em>Watch Dogs Legion</em>, for example, all three processors benefit by 10 to 12 percent by switching from DDR5-4800 CL40 to DDR5-6000 CL40. In the next game, <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, the FPS gain with the 13900K and the 7950X3D almost falls into the range of the measurement tolerances&mdash;only the 7700X,the weakest CPU in the test field, can benefit somewhat from the faster RAM. Another game in which all CPUs can register performance gains from faster RAM is <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em>, which scales well with faster RAM or a faster CPU according to our own experience. </p>


<p class="cta wp-block wp-block-button"><a class="cta__btn" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/s?k=gaming+RAM&amp;crid=1TU896YRZEZUM&amp;xcust=2-1-2030982-7-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Shop gaming RAM on Amazon</a></p>


<p>Across the seven games on average, it can be seen that the weakest processor benefits the most from higher RAM clock speeds. Just switching from 4800MHz to 6000MHz increases the FPS by 11 percent on average, and optimizing the latencies from CL40 to CL30 results in a further performance gain of 9 to 12 percent. With the Ryzen 9 7950X3D, the performance difference between the fastest and slowest configuration is much more manageable at just 7 to 11 percent. Reason number one is that the CPU quite often runs into the GPU limit. Reason two is that the X3D processor has a significantly larger L3 cache than, for example, the 7700X and therefore there are fewer accesses to the main memory. </p>



<p>The 13900K shows a similar picture to the 7950X3D. By switching from DDR5-4800 CL40 to DDR5-6000 CL30, the FPS increases on average by just 8 to 9 percent. The even faster RAM with 7200MHz at CL32 can bring out another 3 percent, a difference that is measurable but not really noticeable.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="ddr4-how-much-extra-performance-does-xmp-or-expo-bring-in-games">DDR4: How much extra performance does XMP or EXPO bring in games? </h2>



<p>A few years ago, we examined a similar comparison with DDR4 RAM and, in particular, the influence of latencies. In the following table we have listed all the RAM speeds and latencies we tested:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><thead><tr><th><strong>RAM specification  </strong></th><th><strong>Latencies</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>2666 MHz CL19-19-43</p></td><td><p>~ 14.25 ns</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>3000 MHz CL16-18-38</p></td><td><p>~ 10.67 ns</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>3000 MHz CL14-14-14-34</p></td><td><p>~ 9.33 ns</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>3200 MHz CL16-18-18-38</p></td><td><p>~ 10.00 ns</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>3200 MHz CL14-14-14-34</p></td><td><p>~ 8.75 ns</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>3600 MHz CL18-22-42</p></td><td><p>~ 10.00 ns</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>3600 MHz CL16-16-36</p></td><td><p>~ 8.89 ns</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>3800 MHz CL18-22-22-42</p></td><td><p>~ 9.47 ns</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>4000 MHz CL18-22-22-42</p></td><td><p>~ 9.00 ns</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>4000 MHz CL17-17-37</p></td><td><p>~ 8.50 ns</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>4266 MHz CL18-26-26-46</p></td><td><p>~ 8.44 ns</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Our tests showed an almost identical picture. The example of <em>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed Odyssey</em> shows that there are games where we quickly run into the GPU limit and therefore only benefit slightly from faster RAM. Even with a RAM clock of 3000MHz at CL14, we were able to measure just as many FPS with both test CPUs within the measurement tolerances as with a RAM clock of 3600MHz or even 4000MHz.  </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Assassins Creed Odyssey RAM-Test" class="wp-image-2023486" height="673" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/AC_Odyssey.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG</p></div>



<p>F1 2019, on the other hand, is an example where it is not only the RAM clock that matters, but also tight latencies. The Intel CPU in particular benefits significantly from optimized timings. With AMD, on the other hand, the drop in FPS values from 3800MHz is noticeable. From this RAM clock onwards, the RAM (real clock), the memory controller, and the Infinity Fabric no longer work in a 1:1:1 ratio, but in a 2:1:1 ratio, which causes the performance to plummet. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Assassins Creed Odyssey RAM-Test" class="wp-image-2023486" height="673" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/AC_Odyssey.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG</p></div>



<p><em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> is another example of how faster RAM brings greater performance gains, predominantly in the lower clock range.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Shadow of the Tomb Raider RAM-Test" class="wp-image-2023492" height="673" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Tomb_Raider_Shadow.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG</p></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="ddr4-vs-ddr5-memory-with-core-i9-12900k">DDR4 vs. DDR5 memory with Core i9-12900K</h2>



<p>Whether you should go with DDR4 or DDR5 RAM is only relevant with the Intel processors of the 12th and 13th Core generation. AMD does not offer processors whose memory controller supports both memory types. We took the Core i9-12900K as an example for our test in 12 games and tested it with different clock rates:</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="12900K DDR4 vs DDR5 - 720p" class="wp-image-2008148" height="320" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/12900K-DDR4-vs-DDR5-720p.webp" width="640" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Sebastian Schenzinger</p></div>



<p>During the tests in the CPU limit, we were able to determine differences between DDR4 and DDR5 memory, but they were not really big. In the meantime, however, new DDR5 modules are available, which offer significantly better timings than when the new RAM standard was released.</p>


<p class="cta wp-block wp-block-button"><a class="cta__btn" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/s?k=gaming+RAM&amp;crid=1TU896YRZEZUM&amp;xcust=2-1-2030982-7-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Shop gaming RAM on Amazon</a></p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="how-to-find-the-clock-rates-and-change-them-in-the-bios">How to find the clock rates and change them in the BIOS</h2>



<p>Finding out the current RAM clock is very easy with a current version of Windows 10 or Windows 11. To do this, open the Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc) and switch to the <em>Performance</em> tab. With the window maximized and the <em>RAM </em>selected, the speed can be easily read. The number of RAM modules installed and the number of available slots are also visible. From this it can be concluded whether the RAM is working in dual channel or not.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="task manager memory" class="wp-image-2031015" height="734" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/task-manager-memory-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Foundry</p></div>



<p>If you want to activate an XMP or EXPO, this can be done quickly in the BIOS. All you have to do is activate the correct memory profile (see picture below). <strong>Note:</strong> With AMD&rsquo;s AM4 motherboards, the term &ldquo;D.O.C.P.&rdquo; is common here. </p>



<p>To do this, start your PC and press either the <strong>F2</strong> or <strong>Del</strong> key during startup to enter the BIOS. There you activate the XMP, which can be found under the <em>Overclocking Settings</em>. Sometimes it is even possible that your main memory is equipped with several profiles&mdash;in this case, of course, you have the choice. Then confirm the changes you have made and restart the PC. In the task manager you can then check whether the set clock is present. If you cannot select XMP, EXPO, or D.O.C.P. in the BIOS, your RAM or motherboard does not support this function.</p>

<p>AOC is the latest to enter the increasingly competitive field of 27-inch, 1440p, 240Hz OLED gaming monitors. The Agon Pro AG276QZD attempts to set itself apart with a unique, asymmetric design and good connectivity, but image quality quirks hold back the AG276QZD&rsquo;s potential.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="aoc-agon-pro-ag276qzd-what-are-the-specs">AOC Agon Pro AG276QZD: What are the specs?</h2>



<p>If the AOC Agon Pro AG276QZD&rsquo;s specifications feel a bit familiar, well, that&rsquo;s no surprise. The recent flood of 27-inch, 1440p OLED gaming monitors rely on a particular LG Paper White panel suited to computer monitors.</p>



<ul>
<li>Display size: 26.5-inch widescreen</li>



<li>Native resolution: 2560&times;1440</li>



<li>Panel type: OLED</li>



<li>Refresh rate: 240Hz</li>



<li>Adaptive Sync: G-Sync compatible</li>



<li>HDR: Yes, HDR10</li>



<li>Ports: 2x HDMI 2.0, 2x DisplayPort 1.4, 2x USB-A 3.2 Gen 1, 3.5mm audio-out</li>



<li>VESA mount: Yes</li>



<li>Speakers: Yes, 2x 5-watt</li>



<li>Price: $999.99</li>
</ul>



<p>That makes it hard for any one monitor to stand out, and the AG276QZD is no different. Its size, resolution, and refresh rate exactly match competing monitors from LG, Corsair, Asus, and Acer.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="aoc-agon-pro-ag276qzd-design">AOC Agon Pro AG276QZD: Design</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AOC Agon Pro AG276QZD" class="wp-image-2032136" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aoc-agon-pro-ag276qzd-5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>AOC Agon Pro AG276QZD (backside) with a hexagonal monitor stand.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>AOC must&rsquo;ve understood the Agon Pro AG276QZD&rsquo;s technical similarities to its competition, because the company goes wild with the monitor&rsquo;s design.</p>



<p>The display&rsquo;s look revolves around an asymmetric pentagon shape found on both the monitor&rsquo;s rear panel and the monitor stand. It&rsquo;s a bold alternative to the classic symmetric shapes used by most competitors. AOC adds emphasis with customizable RGB-LED lighting on the rear of the monitor. The light&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t bright, however, so they only leap out in a dark room.</p>



<p>AOC&rsquo;s asymmetric design continues with the compact stand base. The design takes some adjustment, as it&rsquo;s difficult to know which orientation is the &ldquo;correct&rdquo; placement. Looks aside, the stand&rsquo;s small, slim profile is good news for gamers with limited desk space. Ergonomic adjustments are available, too, with support for height, tilt, swivel, and rotation.</p>



<p>The stand attaches to the monitor with a clip mechanism instead of a VESA mount. However, the display panel itself is VESA compatible, so a third-party monitor arm or stand remains an option.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>AOC must&rsquo;ve understood the Agon Pro AG276QZD&rsquo;s technical similarities to its competition, because the company goes wild with the monitor&rsquo;s design.</p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="aoc-agon-pro-ag276qzd-features-and-menus">AOC Agon Pro AG276QZD: Features and menus</h2>



<p>A pair of HDMI 2.0 ports and DisplayPort 1.4 ports lurk behind the AOC Agon Pro AG276QZD&rsquo;s rear panel, providing a total of four video inputs. That&rsquo;s excellent for any gaming monitor, and a slight improvement over the alternatives, which usually have three video inputs.</p>



<p>However, only the DisplayPort 1.4 inputs can handle the monitor&rsquo;s 1440p resolution at its maximum refresh rate of 240Hz. The HDMI 2.0 ports are limited to 1440p at 144Hz. AOC&rsquo;s competitors share this problem.</p>



<p>USB-C connectivity is limited to two USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 downstream ports powered by a single USB-B upstream. This isn&rsquo;t a lot of USB connectivity&mdash;though, again, it&rsquo;s similar to the competition. If you want USB-C, consider the Corsair Xeneon 27QHD240.</p>



<p>AOC&rsquo;s menu system is adequate, but only just. A joystick on the monitor&rsquo;s right rear flank provides quick, responsive access to the menus. However, the menu system&rsquo;s arrangement can prove confusing. Some menu options are adjusted with a left/right movement, while others use an up/down movement. The lack of consistency can lead to mistakes.</p>



<p>The monitor includes several color modes, color temperature, and color gamma presets, but most are not calibrated to a particular target. There&rsquo;s an sRGB and DCI-P3 mode, at least. AOC chucks in gaming-centric features, like a crosshair and customization of the &ldquo;LightFX&rdquo; RGB-LED lighting on the monitor&rsquo;s back panel. Picture-in-picture and picture-by-picture modes are available, too.</p>



<p>Speakers are bundled in the AG276QZD, but don&rsquo;t expect to rely on them. They deliver thin, hollow sound that&rsquo;s easily overwhelmed by bass. They&rsquo;re okay for podcasts, but music, games, and movies can sound harsh, metallic, and grating.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-is-the-aoc-agon-pro-ag276qzds-sdr-image-quality">How is the AOC Agon Pro AG276QZD&rsquo;s SDR image quality?</h2>



<p>The AOC Agon Pro AG276QZD&rsquo;s 27-inch 1440p panel provides the technology needed to deliver top-tier image quality. It lives up to expectations in some areas, but stumbles in others.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AOC Agon Pro AG276QZD" class="wp-image-2032138" height="793" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aoc-agon-pro-ag276qzd-brightness.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>Brightness is an unsurprising limitation of the AOC Agon Pro AG276QZD. All monitors based on the LG Paper White OLED panel have problems in this area. That said, a brightness of 244 nits is usable in most situations, and I generally left the monitor at roughly 50 percent of its maximum. Brightness is only an issue when the monitor is used in an extremely bright room or near a sunlit window.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AOC Agon Pro AG276QZD" class="wp-image-2032139" height="825" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aoc-agon-pro-ag276qzd-contrast.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>The AG276QZD delivers on OLED&rsquo;s promised contrast with an effectively infinite contrast ratio. This occurs because the monitor can deliver a brightness of exactly zero nits when required.</p>



<p>Infinite contrast leads to a rich, immersive experience. There&rsquo;s a real sense of depth and dimensionality to high-resolution, contrast-rich content. This, along with the monitor&rsquo;s thin bezels, can make it seem as if you&rsquo;re looking through a window, not at a display.</p>



<p>Dark, moody content excels, as there&rsquo;s no hint of the grayish glow common to most monitors. Shadow detail is well preserved, too, so subtle figures and silhouettes remain visible in dim scenes. That&rsquo;s useful when playing games like <em>Diablo IV</em> or <em>Left 4 Dead 2</em>, and when viewing dimly lit movies such as <em>The Batman</em>.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AOC Agon Pro AG276QZD" class="wp-image-2032140" height="793" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aoc-agon-pro-ag276qzd-color-gamut.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>Color gamut is where AOC&rsquo;s fortunes begin to turn.</p>



<p>The AG276QZD provides a color gamut that spans 100 percent of sRGB, 91 percent of AdobeRGB, and 87 percent of DCI-P3. That&rsquo;s short of the competition. Corsair&rsquo;s Xeneon 27QHD240 and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1440675/alienware-aw3423dwf-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Alienware&rsquo;s AW3423DWF</a> both outperform the AOC in color gamut. The same is true of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1528866/aoc-agon-pro-ag274qzm-monitor-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">AOC&rsquo;s Agon Pro AG274QZM</a>, a Mini-LED alternative.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AOC Agon Pro AG276QZD" class="wp-image-2032141" height="845" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aoc-agon-pro-ag276qzd-color-accuracy.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>And color accuracy is where the story truly sours. The AG276QZD scored rather poorly in color accuracy with an average color error far beyond any of its alternatives.</p>



<p>I&rsquo;ve tested enough monitors based on LG&rsquo;s Paper White panel to, at this point, call disappointing color accuracy a common problem for this panel type. The AG276QZD is the worst of the bunch, however, and it shows.</p>



<p>Colors tend to appear overly saturated and neon-like on the AG276QZD. This is most obvious in yellow, which tends to shift towards an unnatural yellow-green hue, but I saw a similar over-saturated skew present in cyan and magenta. I tried to tame this effect with the monitor&rsquo;s color calibration features, but with limited success.</p>



<p>How much this matters depends on how you plan to use the monitor. Gamers likely won&rsquo;t notice anything amiss. Indeed, a somewhat over-saturated and vivid look can seem subjectively better in games, even when it&rsquo;s not technically accurate. If you&rsquo;re a content creator who works with photos, video, or digital art frequently, however, give the AG276QZD a pass.</p>



<p>I also noticed the monitor&rsquo;s default gamma was off at a reading of 1.9. This indicates images appear a bit more luminous than they should. Color temperature was acceptable, though, with a reading of 6800K (just a tad cooler than the desired 6500K).</p>



<p>Sharpness can be an issue. Most OLED monitors currently available have a sub-pixel layout that differs from the RGB layout Windows expects, which leads to color fringing issues around high-contrast borders. When reading a fine text, for example, you may notice the space between letters or digits has a jagged and somewhat off-color look. It&rsquo;s not a major problem for web browsing, but it could become annoying if you spend most of your time in Excel.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-is-the-aoc-agon-pro-ag276qzds-hdr-image-quality">How is the AOC Agon Pro AG276QZD&rsquo;s HDR image quality?</h2>



<p>The AOC Agon Pro AG276QZD supports HDR but, unlike its competition, it&rsquo;s not VESA DisplayHDR 400 True Black certified. This proves less important than you might think, but HDR performance is disappointing.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s because the AG276QZD, like all OLED monitors, has difficulty achieving and sustaining a high level of brightness. I measured a maximum HDR brightness of 224 nits (a bit less than SDR, actually). That&rsquo;s way below the 600 to 800 nits required for a passable HDR experience. In real-world viewing, the monitor&rsquo;s limited brightness means bright areas of an image that should reveal more detail instead appear washed-out and uniform.</p>



<p>I also noticed the usual issues with SDR tone mapping when HDR is turned on in Windows. SDR content viewed on the Windows desktop will appear less color accurate when HDR is turned on. Many monitors share this problem, and it&rsquo;s certainly noticeable here.</p>



<p>No OLED gaming monitor on the market right now is a great pick for HDR content. Still, the AG276QZD&rsquo;s overall performance is lackluster. In general, gamers who want to use HDR on an OLED gaming monitor should look towards monitor&rsquo;s with Samsung&rsquo;s QD-OLED panel, such as the Alienware AW3423DWF and Samsung Odyssey G8 OLED, as they deliver superior peak brightness.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-is-the-aoc-agon-pro-ag276qzds-motion-performance">How is the AOC Agon Pro AG276QZD&rsquo;s motion performance?</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AOC Agon Pro AG276QZD" class="wp-image-2032142" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aoc-agon-pro-ag276qzd-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>AOC Agon Pro AG276QZD comes with a 240Hz refresh rate and G-Sync compatibility.</p>

<p>Motion clarity is an undeniable win for the AOC Agon Pro AG276QZD. It delivers the killer combo: a 240Hz refresh, extremely low pixel response times, and Nvidia G-Sync support.</p>



<p>The 240Hz refresh rate provides buttery-smooth gameplay with a tight, crisp response to user input. Granted, the game you&rsquo;re enjoying will need to render at 240 frames per second to fully use this feature, but the monitor&rsquo;s 1440p resolution (which demands less of a video card than 4K resolution) makes this achievable in esports titles on midrange graphics hardware.</p>



<p>Low pixel response times help make the most of the 240Hz refresh rate. OLED panels can achieve response times down to 0.03 milliseconds gray-to-gray. This results in less motion blur, as pixels &ldquo;respond&rdquo; to changes in color quickly. While this is useful at 240Hz, it also applies at lower refresh rates, which is handy if you enjoy demanding games that dip your frame rate into the double-digits.</p>

<p>Official Nvidia G-Sync support is appreciated, too. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with AMD FreeSync but, as Steam&rsquo;s hardware survey makes clear, most PC gamers opt for an Nvidia graphics card. And there&rsquo;s a bonus: though not officially listed, AMD FreeSync Premium when I connected the monitor to an AMD Radeon 6600 video card.</p>



<p>The AG276QZD&rsquo;s excellent motion clarity isn&rsquo;t unusual for the category. All 27-inch, 1440p, 240Hz OLED monitors achieve similar results. Still, the motion clarity offered here is sure to please both casual and competitive players.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="is-the-aoc-agon-pro-ag276qzd-worth-it">Is the AOC Agon Pro AG276QZD worth it?</h2>



<p>The AOC Agon Pro AG276QZD has a clever design and good feature set for a 27-inch 1440p OLED monitor, but it feels like an also-ran in the category.</p>



<p>Alternatives like the Corsair Xeneon 27QHD240 deliver better overall image quality with a side of USB-C connectivity. The real threat, however, is the Alienware AW3423DWF and Samsung Odyssey OLED G8: these 34-inch ultrawides deliver a larger display, better color performance, and brighter HDR at a similar price.</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re not committed to OLED, the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1528866/aoc-agon-pro-ag274qzm-monitor-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">AOC Agon Pro AG274QZM</a> is a compelling alternative. Priced just $50 higher, this Mini-LED monitor scores wins in brightness, color performance, sharpness, and HDR image quality.</p>



<p>The AOC Agon Pro AG276QZD is a decent OLED gaming monitor but, absent a major discount, it&rsquo;s tough to recommend over the alternatives.</p>
