<p>The background-checking tool used by Match Group to offer a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tinder-background-checks-garbo-165142514.html">safety feature for Tinder users</a> is shutting down. The non-profit and female-founded Garbo, which the dating app conglomerate has partnered with since 2019, will shut down its consumer tool at the end of August. “Most tech companies just see trust and safety as good PR,” Kathryn Kosmides, Garbo’s founder and CEO, told <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, which <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2f007401-3eaa-4237-b69b-54ccbe125502&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Wall+Street+Journal&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyZjAwNzQwMS0zZWFhLTQyMzctYjY5Yi01NGNjYmUxMjU1MDIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS90ZWNoL3RpbmRlci1tYXRjaC1ncm91cC1iYWNrZ3JvdW5kLWNoZWNrcy1ub25wcm9maXQtZW5kLTQ2Nzc5ZjhiIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3YWJlYTJhZC02MmVjLTQ2ODctYjcwNS04NDI3NmJiN2M4OTYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdbWooq4NBQD1MCvNtUqA5pIRdpR7Dbn4O_s38Y4nfKe&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Ftech%2Ftinder-match-group-background-checks-nonprofit-end-46779f8b">published a report</a> on the severed partnership. “I’d rather Garbo shift focus to our other efforts than allow the vision of Garbo to be compromised and relegated to a piece of big corporations’ marketing goals.”</p><p>A Match Group spokesperson supplied a statement to Engadget. “Match Group has made significant investments to enhance safety across our platforms over the last few years and we will continue to do so. From features like ‘Are you Sure?’ and ‘Does this bother you?’ to background checks, we have created tools and made investments that no other dating apps offer. We are committed to continuously investing and building industry-leading features that give users more information and control over who they choose to connect with on our platforms.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company suggests it’s in the process of finding a replacement partner to check for histories of violence. “While we are disappointed that we were unable to come to an agreement, we are in advanced conversations with alternate providers and will announce a new partnership soon,” the spokesperson wrote.</p><figure><img alt="CHINA - 2023/02/19: In this photo illustration, the online dating app Hinge logo is seen displayed on a smartphone with an economic stock exchange index graph in the background.

She described internal disputes within Match Group brands about how to make the tool work.</p><p>Tinder leaders reportedly pushed for a system that would encourage users to run background checks on themselves to receive a badge on their profile, described as “a way to engage those who are less likely to run [background checks] themselves (predominantly men) and highlight the majority of people that are good,” an internal document viewed by the <em>WSJ</em> read. Garbo rejected the idea, and Kosmides told the paper, “You can’t white-list someone or give them a ‘good guy, bad guy’ identity verification.”</p><p>Public and regulatory interest in dating app safety rose in 2019 when <em>ProPublica</em> published a <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/tinder-lets-known-sex-offenders-use-the-app-its-not-the-only-one">widely circulated story</a> about sex offenders using dating apps. A Match Group spokesperson was quoted in the story as telling  Columbia Journalism Investigations, “There are definitely registered sex offenders on our free products.” The uproar led to increased scrutiny from Capitol Hill. U.S. Reps. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) and Ann Kuster (D-NH) <a href="https://schakowsky.house.gov/media/press-releases/schakowsky-kuster-lead-letter-match-group-president-calling-improvements">sent a letter</a> in 2020 to Match Group inquiring about protecting users from registered sex offenders. The pair sent a follow-up letter this July, noting that the dating company no longer discloses the size of its trust and safety team.</p><p>The intensified public and political interest heightened pressure on Match Group to do something, and its leadership reportedly saw Garbo — a new and untested product still under development at the time — as a novel solution. The dating conglomerate <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tinder-match-group-garbo-background-check-data-142745236.html">announced its $1.5 million partnership</a> with the group in 2021 and launched a consumer tool the following year — with the company paying to offer two free background searches for Tinder users. Some criticized the move for providing a false sense of security, although Match Group cautioned not to view it as an all-in-one fix.</p><p>This summer, with Match Group and Garbo failing to agree on funding terms, the latter’s board met and voted to terminate the tool. Garbo, which also partnered with smaller firms, says it will shift back to being volunteer-run beginning on September 1st. The organization <a href="https://www.garbo.io/blog/%20next-phase-at-garbo">says</a> it will “refocus our efforts on further ways to directly empower individuals with new and innovative tools to protect themselves from gender-based violence and other interpersonal harms in the digital age.”</p><p>Undeterred from its core mission, it adds, “We also plan to continue fiercely advocating for reforms in the criminal justice and public record systems to protect victims and hold bad actors accountable.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/tinder-is-losing-the-tool-it-uses-for-background-checks-210539913.html?src=rss

<p>Summer is drawing to a close, which means the busy fall season of tech events is almost upon us. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/microsoft/"><ins>Microsoft</ins></a> has marked its territory by sending out save-the-date invites to a &quot;special event&quot; in New York City on September 21st, but the company hasn't provided any details on what to expect as yet.</p><p>This could very well be Microsoft's major fall hardware event, during which the company typically reveals its latest Surface devices and other gear. If so, that would mean Microsoft is moving back to its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-2021-event-recap-185020522.html"><ins>old late September slot</ins></a> after switching to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-2022-event-live-blog-135459267.html"><ins>an October date</ins></a> last year. In any case, given the company's focus over the past year or so, it's likely to talk quite a bit about its various AI endeavors during this showcase. There's always a chance we could learn about new Windows 11 features as well.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The tech industry's fall calendar is taking shape. Apple usually shows off its latest slate of iPhones (which may or may not have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-15-pro-set-to-feature-a-thinner-bezel-titanium-frame-and-usb-c-charging-094118389.html">USB-C charging ports</a> this year) in early- to mid-September, but it hasn't confirmed a date yet. Nor has Google, which will surely reveal its new Pixel devices at some point in the next month or two. Amazon is holding a hardware event <a href="https://www.thurrott.com/amazon/285395/amazon-teases-hardware-event-september-20"><ins>on September 20th</ins></a>, one day before Microsoft's.

## X may soon add ID verification for 'preventing impersonation'

<p>X appears to be working on new ID verification features several months after rampant impersonation temporarily <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-blue-verification-impersonation-disaster-203656712.html"><ins>derailed</ins></a> the company’s paid verification plans. The platform is now working on an additional verification feature that requires users to upload a copy of their government-issued ID and snap a selfie, according to a screenshot <a href="https://twitter.com/nima_owji/status/1691850092385370483"><ins>shared</ins></a> by app researcher Nima Owji.</p><p>Owji, who often uncovers unreleased features in X, first spotted an “ID verified” badge on Musk’s profile earlier this month. Now, he’s discovered an in-app message detailing how it works, suggesting that it may be getting closer to an official launch. “Verify your account by providing government-issued ID,” it says. “This usually takes about 5 minutes.” It explains that users will need to provide a photo of their ID and a selfie.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="02db3b646e304e8aa7901be3cf483ead"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/X?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#X</a> keeps working on the ID verification.

The fine print notes that information shared for verification will be seen by Au10tix as well as X. X will keep “ID images, including biometric data, for up to 30 days” and will use the information “for the purposes of safety and security, including preventing impersonation.”</p><p>An Au10tix representative didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The company’s website <a href="https://www.au10tix.com/company/about/"><ins>advertises</ins></a> “8-second verification without even partial human involvement” and “first-of-a-kind tech detecting synthetic fraud patterns globally.” The company says it’s previously worked with companies like Google, PayPal and Uber.</p><p>X didn’t respond to a request for comment. But the feature suggests the company is looking for new ways to combat impersonation on the platform. Right now, X offers verified status to anyone paying for an X Premium (formerly known as Twitter Blue) subscription.</p><p>The company doesn’t conduct its own identity checks, though it has implemented some safeguards, like its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-early-access-waitlist-organization-verification-093816293.html"><ins>verified organizations</ins></a> feature. Still, some impersonators have still managed to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/disney-junior-fake-account-twitter-verified"><ins>slip through</ins></a>. Verification has also been exploited by <a href="https://protos.com/twitter-verification-is-making-scammers-millions-heres-how/"><ins>numerous scammers</ins></a>, particularly crypto scammers, who use the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitters-video-and-ranking-perks-arrive-to-paying-blue-subscribers-125538009.html"><ins>additional visibility</ins></a> that comes with an X premium subscription to elevate their posts. It’s unclear if adding optional identity checks would fully solve these issues, but it could make some scammers and impersonators a bit easier to identify.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/x-may-soon-add-id-verification-for-preventing-impersonation-190422905.html?src=rss

## ‘Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak’ will be free on the Epic Games Store this month

<p><em>Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak</em> will be free on the Epic Games Store later this month. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-13-gaming-irl-control-wow-classic.html">well-received 2016 prequel</a> to 1999 real-time strategy classic <em>Homeworld</em> arrives ahead of <em>Homeworld 3</em>, due <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sci-fi-strategy-game-homeworld-3-has-been-delayed-to-february-2024-061237843.html">early next year</a> after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/homeworld-3-delay-gearbox-interactive-blackbird-rts-165808680.html">multiple delays</a>. The (usually $50) <em>Deserts of Kharak</em> will be available to claim on Epic’s storefront from August 24th to 31st.</p><p>The 2016 game takes place over a century before the events of <em>Homeworld</em> on the desert world of Kharak. The arid planet is the once-home of the Kushan people, protagonists of the 1999 original and central figures in the series. It’s the only Homeworld installment to move the action from space to the ground as you navigate the terrain to gain the advantage over the Kiith Gaalsien. This cult-like faction believes anyone who dreams of flying to the stars deserves harsh punishment — something they’re all too happy to dole out. Its gameplay honors the series’ strategic roots while adapting to ground play’s reduced axes of movement by making elevation (navigating the desert’s plateaus and valleys) a core focus.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Snagging the game for free can give the franchise’s fans something to tide them over ahead of <em>Homeworld 3</em> in February 2024 — and publisher Gearbox Software would surely love to lure some younger gamers into the nearly quarter-century-old series.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="Promotional still from &#x002018;Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak.&#x002019; A red tank with a U-shaped turret sends fiery blasts toward enemies in the distance.

After the first game’s critically acclaimed reception, original developer Relic Entertainment made two more (also well-received) games: an expansion and a proper sequel. However, after 2003’s <em>Homeworld 2</em>, THQ bought Relic and failed to produce a single Homeworld game under its ownership.</p><p>The series only got another lease on life after THQ folded and Gearbox Software won a 2013 auction to secure its rights. The Borderlands maker revived the saga with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-02-24-homeworld-remastered-review.html">remastered versions</a> of the classic titles. <em>Deserts of Kharak</em> followed soon after, and <em>Homeworld 3</em> was finally announced in 2019, using a crowdfunding campaign to raise money and gauge consumer interest. After several delays, the long-awaited third installment will (hopefully) arrive next winter.</p><p>Claiming the PC game from August 24th to 31st will require an Epic Games account. During that time, you can navigate to the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/homeworld-deserts-of-kharak"><em>Deserts of Kharak store page</em></a> in a browser or use the Epic Games Launcher to redeem it.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/homeworld-deserts-of-kharak-will-be-free-on-the-epic-games-store-this-month-181511485.html?src=rss

<p>Activision has spilled the beans about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-next-call-of-duty-game-is-modern-warfare-iii-165748261.html"><em><ins>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III,</ins></em></a> revealing much more about what players can expect from the next entry in the rebooted series. For one thing, it seems like fans of Call of Duty's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/call-of-duty-vanguard-zombies-trailer-170042898.html"><ins>Zombies mode</ins></a> are in for a treat. Activision is promising the mode's biggest map to date. You'll be able to team up with other squads for the first time and try to survive &quot;massive hordes&quot; of zombies.</p><p>Although Sledgehammer Games is leading development on <em>Modern Warfare III, </em>a bunch of other Activision studios are lending a hand. Treyarch, one of the core Call of Duty developers, handled this year's Zombies mode, which tells a &quot;Dark Aether&quot; story. Along with secrets to unearth and a variety of missions to check out, Zombies includes &quot;an open-world PvE extraction survival experience&quot; and some of the biggest enemies in the franchise's history, Activision said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Zombies is not the only major multiplayer mode, of course, and <em>MWIII </em>will pay tribute to one of the series' high points. Every one of the original 16 multiplayer maps from the 2009 version of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-31-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-campaign-remastered-now-available-ps4.html"><em><ins>Modern Warfare 2</ins></em></a> will be available at the outset. Sledgehammer has modernized classic maps like Terminal and Highrise with new modes and gameplay features. More than 12 new six vs. six maps will arrive in future seasons.</p><p>From the jump, there will be three new Battle Maps on which you'll duke it out in the Ground War and Invasion modes, along with a War map. The latter marks the return of the War Mode that made its series bow in 2017's <em>Call of Duty: WWll</em>.</p><figure><img alt="Soldiers take cover behind a shield in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III's multiplayer mode." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/de316f10-3d25-11ee-97de-b93fff20ed29" style="height: 2160px; width: 3840px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sledgehammer Games/Actvision</div></figure><p>You can expect fresh movement mechanics, such as a Tac-Stance for tactical close-quarters combat. Activision says Sledgehammer has refined the reload cancel and slide cancel mechanics, while you should find it faster to aim down sights out of slide. Meanwhile, all perks will be available at the beginning of a multiplayer match, including a new silent movement one called Covert Sneakers.</p><p>Many players will be pleased to learn that the classic red-dot minimap is back after Infinity Ward omitted it from last year's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mwii-modern-warfare-ii-warzone-2-no-russian-170044023.html"><em><ins>Modern Warfare II</ins></em></a>. There will be a map voting system, while Sledgehammer has given players a health boost, which will increase the time-to-kill — I'm sure players will have no opinions whatsoever about that change.</p><p>You won't necessarily have to start over your collection of multiplayer gear from scratch. Last week, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/call-of-duty-players-can-bring-most-of-their-modern-warfare-ii-gear-over-to-modern-warfare-iii-170024613.html"><ins>Activision confirmed</ins></a> that, for the first time, players will be able to carry forward nearly all of their unlocked items (including weapons and operators) from <em>Modern Warfare II </em>to <em>Modern Warfare III.</em></p><figure><img alt="A soldier walks through some woods in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III's campaign mode." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/01e21770-3d26-11ee-adf5-bb3cc77eeac7" style="height: 2160px; width: 3840px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sledgehammer Games/Actvision</div></figure><p>On top of all of the multiplayer features, there's the small matter of the campaign. This is a direct sequel to last year's game and it continues the Modern Warfare story with Task Force 141 looking to take down ultranationalist villain Vladmir Makarov. This time around, there's a new type of mission called Open Combat. This offers players the chance to choose their own path through a level and they'll have multiple ways to complete objectives. These levels were built to work around players' preferred play styles, so if you prefer a stealthy approach to an all-guns-blazing one, you might appreciate their flexibility.</p><p><em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III </em>will hit PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and PC (via Steam and Battle.net) on November 10th. There will be a free open beta beforehand, with those who pre-order getting early access. Those folks will also be able to play the campaign up to a week before the game's official release date.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-will-include-the-series-biggest-zombies-map-ever-180029216.html?src=rss

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/honda/"><ins>Honda</ins></a> is looking to make waves in the electric vehicle market. The first model in the automaker's major 2024 push into the space is the Acura ZDX. It expects to obtain an EPA range rating of 325 miles on a single charge for the base A-Spec single-motor configuration.</p><p>That's in the same ballpark as the Tesla Model X (333 miles) and better than the Model Y (303 miles), as well as Ford's Mustang Mach-E (up to 312 miles) and the F-150 Lightning (230 miles). What's more, Honda is touting this range for a starting price of around $60,000. The first Acura ZDX deliveries are slated for early 2024 with <a href="https://www.acura.com/EarlyAccessZDX"><ins>pre-sales</ins></a> starting later this year. Sales will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/acuras-evs-will-be-sold-exclusively-online-starting-in-2024-140054959.html"><ins>take place exclusively online</ins></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company unveiled the EV at Monterey Car Week after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/acura-teases-the-zdx-its-first-electric-vehicle-130051990.html"><ins>teasing it earlier this month</ins></a>. It will be available in two variants: the Acura ZDX A-Spec and ZDX Type S. The former is expected to deliver 340 horsepower. The dual-motor, all-wheel-drive ZDX Type S will have an estimated 500 horsepower and is expected to start at around $70,000. Honda says that will be &quot;the most powerful and best performing Acura SUV ever&quot; but it's expected to eke out a shorter range of 288 miles from the 102 kWh battery. Of note, the ZDX A-Spec will have 20-inch wheels, while the Type S has 22-inch wheels.</p><figure><img alt="Acura ZDX Type S    " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/43e3ce60-3d13-11ee-bebf-9b8c615cb400" style="height: 3113px; width: 4670px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">MullenLowe</div></figure><p>Honda has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/acura-zdx-ev-gets-android-auto-and-built-in-google-apps-161232778.html"><ins>dripfeeding details about the ZDX for months</ins></a>, so it was already known that the EV would have Android Auto, built-in Google apps and Apple CarPlay integration. It will feature an 11-inch touchscreen dashboard for the driver and an 11.3-inch center display. The ZDX is the first Acura model with a Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system, which comes as standard. It has 18 speakers, including a subwoofer.</p><p>Safety features include a rear pedestrian alert and blind zone steering assist. The ZDX Type S has hands-free cruise driver assistance. According to Acura, that allows for &quot;true hands-free driving on up to 400,000 miles of compatible roads.&quot; The Type S also has an automatic parking assist system that should help with parallel parking.</p><p>When it comes to topping up the EV's battery, Honda is hoping you'll never be too far away from a charging station. Last month, it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/major-automakers-team-up-to-create-new-north-american-ev-charging-network-171532385.html"><ins>announced</ins></a> a joint effort with six other automakers to build an extensive network of 30,000 stations in North America. The initiative's first locations are expected to open in the US next summer. Honda also notes that the ZDX supports DC Fast Charging, and a 10-minute top up can add up to 81 miles of range to the ZDX A-Spec's battery in the rear-wheel drive configuration.</p><figure><img alt="Acura ZDX Type S                               " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/61d92dc0-3d13-11ee-b7fd-23c037aaa7e5" style="height: 3065px; width: 4597px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">MullenLowe</div></figure><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/acuras-zdx-ev-has-an-estimated-325-miles-of-range-and-starts-at-around-60000-160023372.html?src=rss

<p>Small outdoor pizza ovens have become popular <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-fall-outdoor-tech-gear-150041103.html">backyard</a> cooking options in recent years. While anyone with a decent-sized patio could have a permanent one installed, these versatile products are more compact and store easily in a bag when you’re not using them. That makes these portable pizza ovens great for home cooks who have limited outdoor space and allows you to take them on the road as needed. There are also great options for having a dedicated pizza oven indoors. Here are a few specs you’ll want to consider before making a purchase, plus our picks for the best pizza ovens.</p><h2>What to look for</h2><p>When shopping for a home pizza oven, you’ll first want to consider what types of pies you plan to make. Most portable outdoor pizza ovens from the likes of Ooni, Solo Stove and others use wood and are primarily designed for the high-heat cooking required for light and airy Neapolitan-style pizzas. We’re talking high temperatures up to 900 degrees Fahrenheit. These units can certainly cook different styles at cooler temperatures, but they’re easiest to use when you’re running them wide open with a full load of wood.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You'll also want to consider alternate fuel types. If you purchase a propane or natural gas burner, you can adjust temperatures easily by turning a knob. For this reason, I recommend you spend the extra $100 or so on that accessory. This dual-fuel option makes your pizza oven a lot more versatile and gives you the option to still have a freshly fired pie when you don’t feel like messing with wood or charcoal. If you only want to cook with gas, there are models available that only use propane or natural gas.</p><p>The other key consideration for aspiring pizza makers is size. Most companies make ovens that fit 12-inch pizzas, a perfect size for one person. They’re also great for pizza parties, since people can customize their own without having to pick off toppings they don’t like. If you want to make larger pizzas or plan to use your oven for other things (pans, etc), consider a larger version that can accommodate more than just small pies. The interior dimensions – or at the very least the pizza stone size – will be listed on most product pages.</p><figure><img alt="The best pizza ovens for 2023" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/5d227b90-d88e-11ed-abef-0e6778381ba5" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><h2>Plan for success</h2><p>Making quality pizza at home requires a considerable amount of counter or table space. You’ll need room to stretch and prep your pizza dough, lay out your mozzarella, other cheeses and toppings and load pies onto a peel. Of course, some folks will be comfortable working in the tight confines of a small kitchen, but I’ve found it much easier to use extra space to make sure I’m not constantly moving things around during the various steps in the process.</p><p>It’s also less hassle to set up your pizza-making station in close proximity to your oven. As a pizza-baking beginner, I did the running back and forth from the kitchen to the back porch. It’s far from ideal. It’s difficult to maintain your fire (if using wood or charcoal) when you’re unable to watch it closely. The good news is a patio table can be easily converted into a pizza station with a large cutting board. This also gets your oven off the ground so it’s easier to access.</p><p>Ooni <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=0de15002-ec35-49d8-b24c-3d060213cd2b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Ooni+Pizza+Ovens&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIwZGUxNTAwMi1lYzM1LTQ5ZDgtYjI0Yy0zZDA2MDIxM2NkMmIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9vb25pLmNvbS9jb2xsZWN0aW9ucy9tb3JlIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlNTgyZGU0Ny04NTUxLTQzODMtYmVhNy0xMTI4OWIxNDMyZTgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVpCSPYvpwI5lfnVJUfzhd1ZlHNXKWc0Kq5RmAT8AHRu&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fooni.com%2Fcollections%2Fmore">sells tables</a> for its ovens that also offer shelving and storage for peels and other accessories. Solo Stove has a <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f5421854-3d3e-46b7-ba38-db91920c7f00&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Solo+Stove&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmNTQyMTg1NC0zZDNlLTQ2YjctYmEzOC1kYjkxOTIwYzdmMDAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9zb2xvc3RvdmUuY29tL2VuLXVzL3AvcGktc3RhbmQiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImU1ODJkZTQ3LTg1NTEtNDM4My1iZWE3LTExMjg5YjE0MzJlOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAUKHwEUykJvcI06_XD6oAcpNoanJJR--93u-mD8kpP85&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsolostove.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fpi-stand">rolling stand</a> for its Pi oven too, with small side shelves and a spot for your propane tank underneath. Of course, you can find other tables and stands to suit your needs, just make sure they can withstand any heat that may radiate from the bottom of the oven while cooking. Most ovens are either well insulated or don’t project too much excess heat toward the table, but you can never be too careful. For that reason, a stainless steel or metal surface is a good choice to set up an outdoor model.</p><p>Most of these ovens cook quickly at high heat, especially if you’re making Neapolitan pizza. Having everything you need nearby so you can keep tabs on the oven and quickly make the next pizza will ease a lot of unnecessary headaches. When your cook time is two minutes or less, you don’t want to venture too far.</p><h2>Best outdoor pizza ovens</h2><h3>A good multi-fuel outdoor pizza oven: Ooni Karu 16</h3><p></p><p>If you’re looking to go all-in on an outdoor pizza oven, you can’t go wrong with <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Pb25pLUthcnUtTXVsdGktRnVlbC1PdXRkb29yLVBpenphL2RwL0IwOTVDSjVLU0QvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXNwLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlNTgyZGU0Ny04NTUxLTQzODMtYmVhNy0xMTI4OWIxNDMyZTgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdlmvMi7k25EJJDjFNPU2W_bx6VJqdXqxG1Z6YBHWKI6&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FOoni-Karu-Multi-Fuel-Outdoor-Pizza%2Fdp%2FB095CJ5KSD%2F">Ooni’s Karu 16</a>. It’s the company’s largest multi-fuel model, which means you can choose between wood, charcoal or gas (propane and natural gas burners sold separately). This one is equipped with a hinged glass door for keeping tabs on your progress and a digital thermometer monitors the ambient temperature inside. The larger size means you can not only cook bigger pizzas, but the Karu 16 can also accommodate pans and cast iron, so baking, roasting and searing are all possible here. It’s this versatility and ease of use that makes the Karu 16 our top pick.</p><h3>A solid outdoor pizza oven: Solo Stove Pi</h3><p></p><p>Solo Stove may be on your radar for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/solo-stoves-fire-pit-20-removable-base-plate-ash-pan-cleanup-143100211.html">its fire pits</a>, but the company also makes a <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Tb2xvLVN0b3ZlLUFzc2VtYmx5LUNvcmRpZXJpdGUtU3RhaW5sZXNzL2RwL0IwQjdYWFhDWkcvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXNwLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlNTgyZGU0Ny04NTUxLTQzODMtYmVhNy0xMTI4OWIxNDMyZTgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARw-Do09kGbwfRdiZRKlaXkKuq5J7mbqweiatd-dPp5f&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSolo-Stove-Assembly-Cordierite-Stainless%2Fdp%2FB0B7XXXCZG%2F">solid multi-fuel pizza oven</a>. Dubbed the Pi, this unit is made out of stainless steel and is round like the company’s trademark products. Solo Stove says Pi can hit cooking temperatures of 850 degrees Fahrenheit with wood and 900 degrees with a gas burner (sold separately). It explains that those figures translate to maximum stone temps of 750 and 800 degrees respectively. The Solo Stove Pi’s big difference from the Karu 16 and other Ooni ovens is that it doesn’t have a front door and stays open the whole time like a brick oven to allow more airflow.</p><h3>Small pizza oven option: Ooni Fyra 12</h3><p></p><p>The <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Pb25pLUZ5cmEtT3V0ZG9vci1Qb3J0YWJsZS1LaXRjaGVuL2RwL0IwODgzODVOOVovP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXNwLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlNTgyZGU0Ny04NTUxLTQzODMtYmVhNy0xMTI4OWIxNDMyZTgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAASFRLfAzMLiznhxBXI5Wuh0iHp4OF_3dwFo9cR_xUWyZ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FOoni-Fyra-Outdoor-Portable-Kitchen%2Fdp%2FB088385N9Z%2F">Ooni Fyra 12</a> was the first outdoor pizza oven I used and it remains one of my favorites. It’s compact compared to some of the alternatives (22 pounds), so it won’t take up quite as much storage space. It also runs on wood pellets instead of chunks, and once you get the fire going, you just refill the chute from the top. This means there’s much less tending a fire on the Fyra than other wood-fired pizza ovens, so you can focus on making and cooking your pizzas. The Fyra does all the things other Ooni pizza ovens do well, including high-heat bakes (950 degrees) in as little as a minute.</p><h2>Indoor pizza ovens</h2><p>Let me preface this section by saying you probably already have an indoor option that you can use to make some great pizza. Whether that’s the main oven in your kitchen or a multi-function countertop unit, with some affordable accessories, you can easily up your game without spending $1,000 on a dedicated appliance. For example, my <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9CcmV2aWxsZS1CT1Y4NjBCU1MtQ291bnRlcnRvcC1Db252ZWN0aW9uLVN0YWlubGVzcy9kcC9CMDg1RlRCTEM2P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXNwLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlNTgyZGU0Ny04NTUxLTQzODMtYmVhNy0xMTI4OWIxNDMyZTgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVcylFxGokn8E7kN4RYhg0kXpXkUgvfVEyVbjXsQ9LQt&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBreville-BOV860BSS-Countertop-Convection-Stainless%2Fdp%2FB085FTBLC6">Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer</a> has a convection pizza setting that automatically adjusts cook time based on the size, oven temperature and whether the pie is fresh or frozen. A key consideration here is size. These things are massive, about the size of a large microwave, so you likely won’t want to keep them out all the time unless you have a huge kitchen.</p><h3>A versatile indoor pizza oven: Ooni Volt 12</h3><p></p><p>Ooni made its name on outdoor pizza ovens that primarily burn wood or run on gas. For 2023, the company is taking things indoors with the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=0de15002-ec35-49d8-b24c-3d060213cd2b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Ooni+Pizza+Ovens&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIwZGUxNTAwMi1lYzM1LTQ5ZDgtYjI0Yy0zZDA2MDIxM2NkMmIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9vb25pLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy9vb25pLXZvbHQiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImU1ODJkZTQ3LTg1NTEtNDM4My1iZWE3LTExMjg5YjE0MzJlOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAbs6K5UOSm8E-W_bMajznrC6hE6gSrwegRQG3GoG3gqs&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fooni.com%2Fproducts%2Fooni-volt">Volt 12</a>. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oonis-volt-12-is-the-companys-first-indoor-pizza-oven-173011466.html">Ooni’s first electric oven</a> can also be used outside thanks to weather resistant construction, but this behemoth brings the company’s design and efficiency to your kitchen for the first time. Capable of temperatures up to 850 degrees Fahrenheit in as little as 20 minutes, the Volt 12 can fire up Neapolitan style pies in 90 seconds. Controls on the front give you the ability to adjust both the top and bottom heating elements. There are also cooking presets and a Boost function to quickly get the stone back to temp between pizzas. The 13-inch stone inside is square, so you can slide in pans for Detroit recipes or other baked goods.</p><h3>A solid indoor pizza oven: Breville Pizzaiolo</h3><p></p><p>If you’re set on buying a dedicated pizza oven, the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9CcmV2aWxsZS1QaXp6YWlvbG8tQlBaODIwQlNTLUJydXNoZWQtU3RhaW5sZXNzL2RwL0IwOFI4WVpSMzI_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tc3AtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImU1ODJkZTQ3LTg1NTEtNDM4My1iZWE3LTExMjg5YjE0MzJlOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAZpOAEufnbwWCGDzjVUYurIRPrRyq2rE2abyRwwaeYbL&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBreville-Pizzaiolo-BPZ820BSS-Brushed-Stainless%2Fdp%2FB08R8YZR32">Breville Pizzaiolo</a> is another great option, but it’s just as pricey as the Volt 12. The Pizzaiolo cooks 12-inch pies as well, but the stone on this unit is perfectly sized for them and there’s a metal heat reflector panel inside that will also keep you from overshooting the cooking surface. This means you won’t be sliding larger rectangle pans in here like you can with the electric Ooni. Round pans fit just fine and some smaller square ones likely will too.</p><p>In terms of cooking ability, Breville offers presets for “Wood Fired,” New York, Pan, Thin &amp; Crispy and Frozen types of pizza with the added option to run the oven full blast at 750 degrees Fahrenheit. A second dial allows you to adjust the top heating element depending on how dark you want your pizza. Like it does on other Breville appliances, Element IQ tech adjusts the heating elements based on the selected style, creating the ideal environment for each one. For advanced users, the company offers a manual mode that turns the timer dial into a control for the bottom deck while the style preset selector manages the top. Breville includes a magnetic overlay for the front panel to show you temperatures for the converted controls. The instruction manual also gives you recommendations for where to begin with manual mode for the aforementioned styles.</p><h3>The best pizza accessories for the oven you already have</h3><p>If you want to make good homemade pizza that rivals that of your favorite pizzeria (and without spending hundreds of dollars on a dedicated oven), you can definitely do it with the oven you already have in your kitchen. With a few gadgets, you can improve your game without splurging on a Breville, Ooni or Solo Stove. First, I’d recommend a high quality baking steel or stone.</p><p><a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9PbGQtU3RvbmUtT3Zlbi1SZWN0YW5ndWxhci1QaXp6YS9kcC9CMDAwMEUxRkRBP3JlZl89YXN0X3N0b19kcCZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1zcC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZTU4MmRlNDctODU1MS00MzgzLWJlYTctMTEyODliMTQzMmU4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAYhn2BEXBjIlUhVUE-gcCDCKkKEbWS800nVc0GwssboU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FOld-Stone-Oven-Rectangular-Pizza%2Fdp%2FB0000E1FDA%3Fref_%3Dast_sto_dp">Baking stones</a> are great for getting better browning on the bottom of your pies than a pizza or sheet pan. You can also use them for bread, cookies and other items. The stone absorbs heat to cook pizza quickly, like the inside of a brick oven, which leads to a charred crust. They’re also more affordable compared to <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9CYWtpbmctU3RlZWwtT3JpZ2luYWwtVWx0cmEtQ29uZHVjdGl2ZS9kcC9CMDBOMjA1RzIyP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXNwLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlNTgyZGU0Ny04NTUxLTQzODMtYmVhNy0xMTI4OWIxNDMyZTgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAeEbDEKojEDMsFXyWihRBYfzEgwmrp2Q1uKdD4J5W_F7&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBaking-Steel-Original-Ultra-Conductive%2Fdp%2FB00N205G22%3F">baking steels</a>. Those metal slabs do have one key advantage: higher heat conductivity. This means a steel will cook your pizzas faster since it can absorb more heat from your oven.

We've seen this discount before and the buds tend to sell out quickly when it appears, so you may not want to wait to snag the deal. The third-gen AirPods are a major improvement over their predecessors, with better sound, longer battery life and a more comfortable fit.

Any content you have bought from the Xbox 360 store will stay in your library and you can watch it on Windows 10 and 11 devices, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. You can also watch any titles with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/movies-anywhere/">Movies Anywhere</a> compatibility on that service's app and website.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You can still buy Xbox 360 games and other content through the console's storefront until next July (you should still be able to find second-hand physical copies of games you want to play too). Any games you have in your library will still work on your Xbox 360 after the store shutters, and you'll be able to access many of them on Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-xbox-backward-compatability-76-games-annoucement-185623778.html"><ins>through backwards compatibility</ins></a> too.

## Can 'modeling' microphones deliver on their copycat promise?

<p>The humble microphone. For many, it’s little more than a tool for a Zoom call. For streamers and podcasters it’s a utilitarian bit of kit. But for some — singers, musicians and other recording artists — it’s an instrument as characteristic and expressive as any guitar or piano. The microphone is often the biggest investment these performers ever make. If you want a different “timbre” to your recordings, then, you could just buy a <em>lot</em> of microphones. Alternatively, you might consider a “modeling” mic - one specifically designed to imitate the character of famous (and usually expensive) models.</p><p>For those not wanting to spend “small condo” levels of money on a <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=e54dc56f-69db-417f-9610-572a1a179058&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sweetwater+Sound&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJlNTRkYzU2Zi02OWRiLTQxN2YtOTYxMC01NzJhMWExNzkwNTgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3dlZXR3YXRlci5jb20vc3RvcmUvZGV0YWlsL0M4MDBHLS1zb255LWMtODAwZy1sYXJnZS1kaWFwaHJhZ20tY29uZGVuc2VyLW1pY3JvcGhvbmUiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjY2YjgzNmRhLTViNTEtNDVkOC1hZjU1LWU5YWU5MjY5MmE5NSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQ8bdBWeq0PttSRNRFiKIaVIWCWQ21qlRCsNY8EspuuD&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sweetwater.com%2Fstore%2Fdetail%2FC800G--sony-c-800g-large-diaphragm-condenser-microphone">well-stocked</a> mic <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=e54dc56f-69db-417f-9610-572a1a179058&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sweetwater+Sound&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJlNTRkYzU2Zi02OWRiLTQxN2YtOTYxMC01NzJhMWExNzkwNTgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3dlZXR3YXRlci5jb20vc3RvcmUvZGV0YWlsL0VMQU0yNTFFLS10ZWxlZnVua2VuLWVsYS1tLTI1MWUtbGFyZ2UtZGlhcGhyYWdtLXR1YmUtY29uZGVuc2VyLW1pY3JvcGhvbmUiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjY2YjgzNmRhLTViNTEtNDVkOC1hZjU1LWU5YWU5MjY5MmE5NSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAdFIr1KJcgHVLTZFW208lo497US0vNOGlVQue8flcy6j&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sweetwater.com%2Fstore%2Fdetail%2FELAM251E--telefunken-ela-m-251e-large-diaphragm-tube-condenser-microphone">locker</a>, something like the <a href="https://www.uaudio.com/microphones/ua-sphere-lx-modeling-microphone.html">$1,000 Sphere LX</a> from Universal Audio offers a tantalizing prospect. It’s one of the aforementioned modeling mics, and it claims to mimic 20 of the most sought after microphones of all time.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Sphere LX itself is a condenser microphone, but thanks to its dual-capsule setup (most mics only have one) it’s able to do some pretty funky stuff. Not only can it pretend to be a dynamic or ribbon mic - both of which use different technology to a condenser - it can imitate environmental factors such as distance from the mic and/or different recording spaces. You can even blend two different virtual microphones at the same time for added versatility. It all sounds very clever on paper, but does it actually sound, well… good?</p><figure><img alt="Sphere LX modeling microphone software." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/7d360b40-36ad-11ee-8efd-f9a3ee024aaf" style="height: 628px; width: 810px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Universal Audio</div></figure><p>Before we get to that, it’s worth understanding the setup required. As the Sphere LX has two capsules (the “sensor” part) it outputs in stereo unlike most vocal microphones that record in mono. This means it ships with a specific XLR splitter cable that requires two ports on your audio interface. So, if your setup currently only has one, you’d need to find a new one with multiple inputs (Shameless plug: I wrote an audio interface buyer's guide that you can read <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-audio-interfaces-130019808.html">right here</a>).</p><p>There are some important steps to take before you can start experimenting with your new virtual microphones. First, if possible, you’ll want to “bind” the two input channels on your interface so that they operate as one. This locks their gain levels so you don’t need to worry about the physical volume controls being different (which could impact the effectiveness of the modeling).</p><p>It’s also important to remove any processing your interface might apply. For example, Universal Audio’s own <a href="https://www.engadget.com/universal-audio-volt-2-volt-276-review-audio-interface-home-studio-170050385.html">Volt 276</a> interface has hardware compression and EQ which you don’t want applied here. Other interfaces also can apply light processing or compression by default, so you will definitely want to check your interface’s settings. Sometimes such processing requires turning off via software - so watch out for that, too.</p><p>With the hardware set, you’ll want to open the Sphere’s companion software. It’s a VST plugin and therefore runs <em>within</em> other software — Ableton Live, Logic Pro or even Garageband will do. Drop the plugin onto the same audio channel assigned to the Sphere LX’s output and you’re set to record. Actually, you can even record first and then add the software later, as the emulation can be applied to any recorded audio (but only recordings from the Sphere will “match” the emulated mic).</p><figure><img alt="Sphere LX modeling microphone software." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/ac0365d0-36ad-11ee-be3f-009a6eb6dfb2" style="height: 628px; width: 810px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Universal Audio</div></figure><p>In the most simple use case, you would record your vocal with the Sphere LX and then choose the microphone you want it to sound like in the software. Then all you need to do is export the audio and you’re done. You can even go back, change the emulation to another microphone and export it a second time, but why stop there?</p><p>One of the key benefits of the dual-capsule system in the Sphere LX over, say, something like Slate’s M1 VMS system, is that it allows for things like changing the direction you were addressing the “mic” after the fact. If you recorded into the Sphere head on, but wanted a slightly off-axis sound (useful for taming high frequencies from a guitar for example), you can do that in the software after the fact. You can even change the <a href="https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-are-microphone-polar-patterns/">polar pattern</a> - the shape/area around the capsule in which sound is received.</p><p>While this feels a bit like witchcraft — changing the physical qualities of a microphone after something has been recorded — it serves both practical and aesthetic purposes. On the practical side, you can theoretically record once and “try out” different microphones, mic placements and polar patterns. This not only saves time with the vocalist or musician, you won’t need to keep moving gear around, perfect if you have a smaller space.</p><div id="2c3bdbb13d694403bbb95e44a6bacda8"><div style="font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc; overflow: hidden; white-space: nowrap; font-family: Interstate, Lucida Grande, Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Sans, Garuda, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-weight: 100;"><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9957be96-25f6-431d-9e37-e15ffa9fc598&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=soundcloud&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5OTU3YmU5Ni0yNWY2LTQzMWQtOWUzNy1lMTVmZmE5ZmM1OTgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9zb3VuZGNsb3VkLmNvbS9lbmdhZGdldC1wb2RjYXN0IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2NmI4MzZkYS01YjUxLTQ1ZDgtYWY1NS1lOWFlOTI2OTJhOTUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQqCxJtWSUdZNZ1-P_IRx9iIVD9T7DcmsLWrfAxCx4H-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Fengadget-podcast" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Engadget">Engadget</a> · <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9957be96-25f6-431d-9e37-e15ffa9fc598&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=soundcloud&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5OTU3YmU5Ni0yNWY2LTQzMWQtOWUzNy1lMTVmZmE5ZmM1OTgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9zb3VuZGNsb3VkLmNvbS9lbmdhZGdldC1wb2RjYXN0L3NldHMvdW5pdmVyc2FsLWF1ZGlvLXNwaGVyZS1seC1taWMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjY2YjgzNmRhLTViNTEtNDVkOC1hZjU1LWU5YWU5MjY5MmE5NSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAUB-h4wXOEksKPQr752-q1KWgAqtqnwU8DrFIwGcwZSh&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Fengadget-podcast%2Fsets%2Funiversal-audio-sphere-lx-mic" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Universal Audio Sphere LX mic modeling examples">Universal Audio Sphere LX mic modeling examples</a></div></div><p>In practice, unless you have all of these classic microphones for comparison, it’s obviously hard to know how close the Sphere LX comes to the originals. I happen to have three of the microphones that are modeled by the system - <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=70a41cf2-0944-4b2e-9fdd-51f91494e8aa&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sennheiser&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI3MGE0MWNmMi0wOTQ0LTRiMmUtOWZkZC01MWY5MTQ5NGU4YWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9lbi11cy5zZW5uaGVpc2VyLmNvbS9yZWNvcmRpbmctbWljcm9waG9uZS1icm9hZGNhc3RpbmctYXBwbGljYXRpb25zLW1kLTQyMS1paSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNjZiODM2ZGEtNWI1MS00NWQ4LWFmNTUtZTlhZTkyNjkyYTk1In0&amp;signature=AQAAAbp2f8R7R0wZzyUzXRvOep90xi8MN9moKipy8iqXMCUe&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fen-us.sennheiser.com%2Frecording-microphone-broadcasting-applications-md-421-ii">Sennheiser’s MD421</a>, <a href="https://www.neumann.com/en-en/products/microphones/tlm-103/">Neumann’s TLM103</a> and <a href="https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/microphones/sm7b?variant=SM7B">Shure’s SM7B</a> - although I use them primarily for spoken word, podcasting and streaming.</p><p>On simple tests with voice recordings, the Sphere LX comes really close for all three. There are definitely differences, but given that two units of the <em>same</em> mic can develop variations from each other over time, the LX likely falls within those differential boundaries. This is further reinforced by listening back to the raw audio captured by the Sphere which is very, very far from what it sounds like with emulation applied.</p><p>I was particularly interested in how well the Sphere LX would emulate the SM7B and the Sennheiser MD421, as these are both dynamic microphones. Condenser microphones work very differently, so the idea that one could imitate the other was interesting. Condenser mics are generally favored in vocal studios as they capture more detail, but dynamic mics are better for those with less than ideal recording conditions. Being able to flip between the two with one mic would be both convenient and impressive.</p><p>The MD421 in particular has a unique character for a dynamic microphone with a surprisingly detailed, lively sound. With a straight voice test, the Sphere LX doesn’t <em>quite</em> capture those trademark “sparkle” frequencies, but it definitely does a good job on generally sounding like the Sennheiser — and it’s distinct from its imitation of the SM7B (also a dynamic mic), but with more emphasis on the lower frequencies.</p><div id="450c1c3ea0034a2181a251b6bc51b7a3"><div style="font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc; overflow: hidden; white-space: nowrap; font-family: Interstate, Lucida Grande, Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Sans, Garuda, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-weight: 100;"><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9957be96-25f6-431d-9e37-e15ffa9fc598&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=soundcloud&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5OTU3YmU5Ni0yNWY2LTQzMWQtOWUzNy1lMTVmZmE5ZmM1OTgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9zb3VuZGNsb3VkLmNvbS9lbmdhZGdldC1wb2RjYXN0IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2NmI4MzZkYS01YjUxLTQ1ZDgtYWY1NS1lOWFlOTI2OTJhOTUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQqCxJtWSUdZNZ1-P_IRx9iIVD9T7DcmsLWrfAxCx4H-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Fengadget-podcast" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Engadget">Engadget</a> · <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9957be96-25f6-431d-9e37-e15ffa9fc598&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=soundcloud&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5OTU3YmU5Ni0yNWY2LTQzMWQtOWUzNy1lMTVmZmE5ZmM1OTgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9zb3VuZGNsb3VkLmNvbS9lbmdhZGdldC1wb2RjYXN0L3NldHMvbW9kZWxpbmctbWljLXZlcnN1cy1tb2RlbGluZy1zb2Z0d2FyZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNjZiODM2ZGEtNWI1MS00NWQ4LWFmNTUtZTlhZTkyNjkyYTk1In0&amp;signature=AQAAAax8KWLQJjrur4F7ZFIu7B9zU8GoASsa0rJloaFagxeQ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Fengadget-podcast%2Fsets%2Fmodeling-mic-versus-modeling-software" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Modeling mic versus modeling software">Modeling mic versus modeling software</a></div></div><p>While the comparison shows a decent facsimile of the Sennheiser’s sound, it’s worth noting that both the MD421 and the SM7B have a physical highpass filters built in that can be adjusted through different settings of bass roll off. This isn’t something that’s replicated in the Sphere’s companion app, so if you wanted any sound other than their default, you would need to apply some post processing.</p><p>There are some other challenges, too. In almost every other recording situation, once the track is laid down, the take is set in stone. You can manipulate it after the fact, of course, but the take itself is immovable. With the Sphere LX, and similar systems, you can reimagine the recording the moment the singer’s lips stop moving. Flicking through each virtual mic and the related setting until you find the one you like the most. This could obviously be a good thing, but option paralysis is the death of many a good audio project.</p><p>The appeal of these systems could also depend on your budget and whether you feel confident that they will remain supported by the manufacturer. This is particularly prudent for professionals. “I find with anything like that you're into ‘what's it going to be worth in the next, you know, five years?’ Or when they decide to make the mic redundant, which I’ve found on products that involve anything software.” Chris Denman, CEO of <a href="http://thatchrisdenman.blogspot.com/">Skyrocket Audio</a> and professional sound engineer told Engadget. The redundancy isn’t a huge risk, unlike many app-dependent gadgets, as VSTs can live outside of an app store, but something to consider.</p><figure><img alt="IK Multimedia Mic Room software." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/c48e64e0-36b9-11ee-bf3b-eadef435c813" style="height: 1092px; width: 2060px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">IK Multimedia</div></figure><p>If you’re curious about microphone modeling but don’t want to jump right into a hardware system, there are software products that claim to do a similar thing without the $1,000 outlay. Something like IK Multimedia’s “<a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c77776cd-956c-41ab-9a68-eadfbcc0ac19&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=IK+Multimedia&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjNzc3NzZjZC05NTZjLTQxYWItOWE2OC1lYWRmYmNjMGFjMTkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaWttdWx0aW1lZGlhLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy90cm1pY3Jvb20vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2NmI4MzZkYS01YjUxLTQ1ZDgtYWY1NS1lOWFlOTI2OTJhOTUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAddnv4FsAp78L3ot7z-1SPg896eFe1a2LRpxktgEuftI&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikmultimedia.com%2Fproducts%2Ftrmicroom%2F">Mic Room</a>” plugin, for example, offers a similar roster of mics for well under $100. To get the best results, your current mic will need to be one the app has a reference for, so there’s possibly an additional spend, and the results aren’t as accurate or as configurable as the Sphere LX, but it’s an easy way to experiment before committing to something like Universal Audio’s solution.</p><p>All in all, whether mic modeling is right for you will come down to personal preference, economics and the projects you need it for. For casual users looking for a do-it-all mic, it’s perhaps a little complex and costly. However, for singers looking for a streamlined, versatile setup, it almost feels like a no brainer. There will be plenty of use cases that fall between and either way, it’s a really interesting concept that will likely only continue to become more accessible.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/can-modeling-microphones-deliver-on-their-copycat-promise-133036629.html?src=rss

<p>The 2023 version of Samsung's Freestyle projector is now available for pre-order through the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f85e63cd-e13c-4f9d-991c-9fbaadede3ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Samsung+Electronics&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmODVlNjNjZC1lMTNjLTRmOWQtOTkxYy05ZmJhYWRlZGUzYWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2Ftc3VuZy5jb20vdXMvdHZzL3RoZS1mcmVlc3R5bGUvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4MWJmYzBhMS1kYWFkLTRhNTItOWNmMS0xYmNlMDM3Mzk4NzIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAaQwCDoe2nueCE6Cooq_IPSVpWRb1ezmEPdGDlGucTV2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Ftvs%2Fthe-freestyle%2F">company's website</a>. Introduced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-2023-freestyle-portable-projector-cloud-gaming-edge-blending-031336930.html">at CES earlier this year</a>, the Freestyle Gen 2 can throw 1080p images on your wall or your ceiling and transform it into a screen that's between 30 and 100 inches in size. Its cradle stand rotates 180 degrees, allowing you to move the screen for the best possible position, and it comes with built-in 360-degree sound capability for immersive viewing.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the compact projector weighs less than two pounds and is meant to be used whether indoors or outdoors, you can also plug it into portable batteries with USB PD and 60W/20V output or above when outlets aren't available. In addition, it comes with the brand's SolarCell Remote, which, like its name indicates, has a solar panel attached to it for easy charging on the go.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Like any regular smart TV, the Freestyle Gen 2 gives you access to the usual streaming apps, including the Samsung TV Plus service. You can also use it to play videos, though, through the Samsung Gaming Hub that lets you stream titles from various providers. The Gaming Hub gives you quick access to Samsung's streaming partners, which include Xbox Game Pass, NVIDIA GeForce NOW, Amazon Luna and Utomik. While the hub is free, you will need a subscription to those services to be able to play the games they have on offer. Also, the projector doesn't come with its own controller, so you'll need to use your own and connect it via Bluetooth.</p><p>The Freestyle Gen 2 projector costs $800 and will be available for pre-order until August 30th, the day before it starts shipping. You'll get a free case with the unit if you purchase it before its launch date.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="A white projector against a white background" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/4a57b9d0-3ce3-11ee-aebe-f1ad3cceb867" style="height: 1067px; width: 1600px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-revamped-freestyle-projector-is-now-available-to-pre-order-130013689.html?src=rss

## The best wireless earbuds for 2023
 - [https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html?src=rss](https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html?src=rss)

<p>Companies continue to find new ways to impress with true wireless earbuds. There’s no doubt the popularity of Apple’s AirPods helped make them a mainstay, but plenty of others offer reliable connectivity, great sound and active noise cancellation (ANC) in increasingly smaller form factors. You can also get extra features that used to be reserved for premium models on mid-range devices. Of course, the popularity means that new earbuds are popping up all the time and the list of options is longer than ever. To help, we’ve compiled our top picks for the best wireless earbuds you can buy right now, including noteworthy features for each.</p><h2>What to look for</h2><p>When it comes to shopping for earbuds, the first thing to consider is design or wear style. Do you prefer a semi-open fit like AirPods or do you want something that completely closes off your ears? If you’re shopping for earbuds with active noise cancellation, you'll want the latter, but a case can be made for the former if you want to wear them all day or frequent places where you need to be tuned in to the ambient sounds. The overall shape of earbuds can impact the fit too, so can the size and weight, so you’ll want to consider all that before deciding. And remember: audio companies aren’t perfect, so despite lots of research, the earbud shape they decided on may not fit you well. Don’t be afraid to return ill-fitting earbuds for something that’s more comfortable.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As wireless earbuds have become the norm, they’re now more reliable for basic things like consistent Bluetooth connectivity. Companies are still in a race to pack as much as they can into increasingly smaller designs. This typically means a longer list of features on the more premium sets of earbuds with basic functionality on the cheapest models. Carefully consider what you can’t live without when selecting your next earbuds, and make sure key items like automatic pausing and multipoint connectivity are on the spec sheet. You’ll also want to investigate the volume controls as you’ll often have to sacrifice access to something else to make that adjustment via on-board taps or swipes.</p><p>When it comes to battery life, the average set of earbuds lasts about five hours on a single charge. You can find sets that last longer, but this is likely enough to get you through a work day if you’re docking the buds during lunch or the occasional meeting. You’ll want to check on how many extra charges are available via the case and if it supports wireless charging.</p><p>Companies will also make lofty claims about call quality on wireless earbuds. Despite lots of promises, the reality is most earbuds still leave you sounding like you’re on speakerphone. There are some sets that deliver, but don’t get your hopes up unless reviews confirm the claims.</p><p>Sound can be subjective, so we recommend trying before you buy if at all possible. We understand this isn’t easy at a time when we’re doing most of our shopping online. But trying on a set of earbuds and listening to them for a few minutes can save you from an expensive case of buyer's remorse. If a store doesn’t allow a quick demo, most retailers have return policies that will let you take earbuds back you don’t like. Of course, you have to be willing to temporarily part with funds in order to do this.</p><p>We also recommend paying attention to things like Spatial Audio, Dolby Atmos, 360 Reality Audio and other immersive formats. Not all earbuds support them, so you’ll want to make sure a perspective pair does if that sort of thing excites you.</p><h2>How we test wireless earbuds</h2><p>The primary way we test earbuds is to wear them as much as possible. We prefer to do this over a one- to two-week period, but sometimes embargoes don’t allow it. During this time, we listen to a mix of music and podcasts, while also using the earbuds to take both voice and video calls. Since battery life for earbuds is typically less than a full day, we drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent).</p><p>To judge audio quality, we listen to a range of genres, noting any differences in the sound profile across the styles. We also test at both low and high volumes to check for consistency in the tuning. To assess call quality, we’ll record audio samples with the earbuds’ microphones as well as have third parties call us.</p><p>When it comes to features, we do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as we work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the earbuds we’re testing are an updated version of a previous model, we’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older buds. Ditto for the closest competition for each new set of earbuds that we review.</p><h2>Best earbuds overall: Sony WF-1000XM5</h2><p></p><p>With the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Tb255LVdGLTEwMDBYTTUtQmx1ZXRvb3RoLUNhbmNlbGluZy1IZWFkcGhvbmVzL2RwL0IwQzM0NU0zVDc_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tNnEtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUyMjk5ZGNkLTM5YjctM2YzMC04NTI0LTJjN2Q3OWQxM2RhYSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAVxNpPa6t5uJ7TQCAxYGfrl1Sn1Q85_7HRb4FgPZU4Vv&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSony-WF-1000XM5-Bluetooth-Canceling-Headphones%2Fdp%2FB0C345M3T7">WF-1000XM5</a>, Sony improves its already formidable mix of great sound, effective ANC and handy features. These earbuds are undoubtedly the company’s best and most comfortable design of its 1000X models so far, which was one of the few remaining riddles Sony needed to solve. Sony still manages to pack in more features than anyone else too, including trademark ones like adaptive sound and Speak-to-Chat. Add in upgraded drivers, new chips and significant improvements to sound quality and these are Sony’s best earbuds yet. But all of the advancements come at a cost: these are also Sony’s most expensive set of wireless earbuds in the 1000X lineup.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Battery life:</strong> 8 hours, up to 24 hours with charging case</p></li><li><p><strong>Water resistance:</strong> IPX4</p></li><li><p><strong>Noise cancellation:</strong> Yes</p></li><li><p><strong>Multipoint:</strong> Yes</p></li></ul><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wf-1000xm5-earbuds-review-striving-for-perfection-160023581.html"><strong>Read our full review of the Sony WF-1000XM5</strong></a></p><h2>Runner up: Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3</h2><p></p><p>If sound quality is your primary concern, the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TZW5uaGVpc2VyLUJsdWV0b290aC1IZWFkcGhvbmVzLUNhbmNlbGxhdGlvbi01MDkxODAvZHAvQjA5VDkzNVgzOD90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby02cS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTIyOTlkY2QtMzliNy0zZjMwLTg1MjQtMmM3ZDc5ZDEzZGFhIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAfVaKpjsglsJRnsFNJZdNBJTV57BR0tPBBYyWdqpCWcW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSennheiser-Bluetooth-Headphones-Cancellation-509180%2Fdp%2FB09T935X38">Momentum True Wireless 3</a> is your best bet for excellent sound and an overall top notch listening experience.

There are a lot of variables to consider and the differences in components make a direct comparison difficult. Personally, I prefer the audio quality from over-ear headphones, but I can tell you the sound from earbuds like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-3-earbuds-announced-220016884.html">Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 3</a> is also outstanding.</p><h3>Which wireless earbuds have the longest battery life?</h3><p>With new models coming out all the time, tracking the hours of battery life for each this can be difficult to keep tabs on. The longest-lasting earbuds we’ve reviewed are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-20-audio-technica-ath-cks5tw-true-wireless-earbuds-review.html">Audio-Technica’s ATH-CKS5TW</a>. The company states they last 15 hours, but the app was still showing 40 percent at that mark during our tests. The only downside is these earbuds debuted in 2019 and both technology and features have improved since. In terms of current models, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/master-and-dynamic-mw08-review-true-wireless-earbuds-143027692.html">Master &amp; Dynamic’s MW08</a> offers 12 hours of use on a charge with ANC off (10 with ANC on) and JBL has multiple options with 10-hour batteries.</p><h3>What wireless earbuds are waterproof?</h3><p>There are plenty of options these days when it comes to increased water resistance. To determine the level of protection, you’ll want to look for an IP (ingress protection) rating. The first number indicates intrusion protection from things like dust. The second number is the level of moisture protection and you’ll want to make sure that figure is 7 or higher. At this water-resistance rating, earbuds can withstand full immersion for up to 30 minutes in depths up to one meter (3.28 feet). If either of the IP numbers is an X, that means it doesn’t have any special protection. For example, a pair of wireless earbuds that are IPX7 wouldn’t be built to avoid dust intrusion, but they would be ok if you dropped them in shallow water.</p><h3>Which earbuds stay in ears the best?</h3><p>A secure fit can vary wildly from person to person. All of our ears are different, so audio companies are designing their products to fit the most people they can with a single shape. This is why AirPods will easily fall out for some but stay put for others. Design touches like wing tips or fins typically come on fitness models and those elements can help keep things in place. You’ll likely just have to try earbuds on, and if they don’t fit well return them.</p><h3>What wireless earbuds work with PS5?</h3><p>PlayStation 5 doesn’t support Bluetooth audio without an adapter or dongle. Even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-inzone-gaming-monitors-headsets-specs-pricing-availability-210056794.html">Sony’s own gaming headsets</a> come with a transmitter that connects to the console. There are universal options that allow you to use any headphones, headset or earbuds with a PS5. Once you have one, plug it into a USB port on the console and pair your earbuds with it.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html?src=rss

There are several ways to take a screenshot on your PC. The most versatile though is probably Microsoft’s Snipping Tool, which lets you save your entire screen or a free-form screenshot. Here’s how to take a screenshot on a PC, including instructions for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-windows-laptop-130018256.html">Windows 11 machines</a> and older, Windows 7 devices, too.</p><h2>How to take a screenshot of the entire screen</h2><p>There are two different ways to screenshot on Windows. The first option is the Print Screen button: to capture your entire screen, press the Windows key and the PrtScn key simultaneously. If your PC doesn’t have the PrtSc button, instead press Fn + Windows key + Spacebar.

<p>Have you ever gone to use an extension and suddenly been unable to access it without warning? Google is attempting to make this a little less of a surprise by <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/extension-safety-hub/">notifying you when it removes an extension from the Chrome Web Store</a>. Of course, this will only be for ones you currently have installed, not just anytime the store's offerings change.</p><p>With this new update, you should receive a notification if one of three things occurs: A developer unpublished an extension you use, if it's marked as malware or if it's removed from the Chrome Web Store due to <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies/">policy violations</a> — such as hate speech or spyware. You won't receive a notification if Google has given a developer time to fix or appeal a possible violation. Google already had steps in place to protect users if the company found an extension to be malware. As before, once marked as such, the extension should be automatically disabled and unable to cause harm.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>These new notifications will appear in the &quot;privacy and security&quot; tab of Chrome's settings under a section called &quot;safety check.&quot; You'll be told how many <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chromes-controversial-new-manifest-v3-extension-platform-is-coming-in-2023-174806613.html">extensions</a> Google removed from the store and have the option to review more details. The new feature will be available in Chrome 117, which is set to come out in early September. Other updates will accompany it, such as a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-is-replacing-chromes-lock-icon-because-most-people-dont-know-what-it-means-194503194.html">tune icon replacing the current lock symbol</a> next to the search bar.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/chrome-will-soon-explain-exactly-why-your-extensions-were-removed-114519317.html?src=rss

Called the Legion Go, it will reportedly run Windows 11 and pack AMD's new Phoenix processors, while offering features like a kickstand, microSD slot and a pair of USB-C ports.&nbsp;</p><p>No specs were leaked, but the Legion Go shows back, shoulder and side triggers, plus a wheel hidden under the top right trigger.
