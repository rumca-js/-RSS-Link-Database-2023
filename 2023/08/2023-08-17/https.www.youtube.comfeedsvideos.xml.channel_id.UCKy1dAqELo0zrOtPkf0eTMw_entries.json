Ellison.\n\nJust weeks before the deadline for his latest commission, composer Steven Lauddem (Peter Dinklage) has lost the creative spark that brought him international acclaim. At the urging of his ever-patient wife Patricia (Anne Hathaway), he searches for inspiration on the Brooklyn waterfront and finds it in Katrina (Marisa Tomei), a thrill-seeking tugboat captain docked in Red Hook, who soon has Steven questioning everything in his life.\n\nMeanwhile, Patricia is experiencing a spiritual crisis of her own that she conceals under a mask of tranquil perfection. As Patricia and Steven wrestle separately with their doubts, their 18-year-old son Julian (Evan Ellison) embarks on a romance with 16-year-old Tereza (Harlow Jane) which threatens to derail both their futures. Also starring Joanna Kulig and Brian d\u2019Arcy James as the girl\u2019s disapproving parents, She Came to Me is a giddy and unforgettable portrayal of the transformational power of love.\n\nThe film is produced by Damon Cardasis, Pamela Koffler, Christine Vachon, Rebecca Miller, Len Blavatnik, and Anne Hathaway. It is co-produced by Cindy Tolan and Ged Dickersin. Danny Cohen, Amanda Ghost, and Vince Holden serve as executive producers.\n\nShe Came to Me, written and directed by Rebecca Miller, opens in theaters on September 29, 2023.\n\n#IGN #Movies", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57c0Y_a2Bq8", "date_published": "2023-08-17T21:59:51+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/57c0Y_a2Bq8/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "IGN voted on the best of Hulu Animayhem shows #familyguy #clevelandshow #animation #shorts", "description": "Presented by Hulu", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1gi1DkwY38", "date_published": "2023-08-17T19:56:19+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/A1gi1DkwY38/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Modern Warfare 3 Shadow Siege Reveal Event - FULL Warzone Gameplay", "description": "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 was revealed to be launching November 11th 2023 and Warzone 2.0 held an event called Shadow Siege that lasts from August 17th to the 21st.
