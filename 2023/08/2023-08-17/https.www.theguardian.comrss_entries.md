## Amusements by Ikechukwu Ufomadu review – inscrutably cool anti-comedy

<p><strong>Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh</strong><br />Assuming the guise of ‘an old-school entertainment type’, this fringe debutant is hypnotically unusual</p><p>The fashion is for fringe newcomers to deliver solo shows all about themselves: potted autobiographies big on identity and self-assertion. By the end of Ikechukwu Ufomadu’s debut, by contrast, we haven’t the faintest idea who he is. Amusements is performed in character as “an old-school entertainment type”, as he’s described it. The voice of chuckling, patrician mid-century American entertainment. The joke, which you’ll spend the show both amused by and trying to pin down, explores the gap between the supposed authority of that stately, avuncular persona and the frictionless superficiality of its every utterance.</p><p>It’s a confidence trick of a show: anti-comedy concealing itself in a tuxedo and the voice of JFK. “Just another of my signature jokes there,” Ufomadu will twinkle, “with a little sprinkling of humour on top.” But the joke is often how thin the jokes are (“don’t waste your 20s being between the ages of 20 and 29”), and how far between: Ufomadu enunciates every word like Orson Welles chewing Japanese whisky.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/18/ikechukwu-ufomadu-amusements-review-pleasance-courtyard-edinburgh-festival">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Postecoglou looks for statement win over United while Newcastle can exploit Manchester City’s injury problems and Caicedo may take centre stage</p><p>Both Forest and Blades began the season with a one-goal defeat, but the mood around them felt very different. Forest were away to Arsenal and missed a terrific early chance to take the lead, then crafted a lovely counter-attacking goal to give their more illustrious opponents a late scare. Blades, on the other hand, lost at home to Crystal Palace – the kind of game they need to win just to have a chance of staying up – so will be desperate for points and a performance this time. And they’ve got a better chance of securing them that they did, having added Tom Davies and Gus Hamer to their squad during the last week. Aged 25 and 26 respectively, both men are ready to hit their peak, with Davies’s leadership, energy and composure complementing Hamer’s guile, imagination and risk-taking. Suddenly, Blades’ midfield looks a better proposition and though who scores for them remains a mystery, their strikers should, at least, be able to rely on something resembling service. <strong>Daniel Harris</strong></p><p><em>Nottingham Forest v Sheffield United, Friday 7.45pm</em></p><p><em>Tottenham v Manchester United, Saturday 5.30pm</em></p><p><em>Liverpool v Bournemouth, Saturday 3pm</em></p><p><em>Manchester City v Newcastle, Saturday 8pm</em></p><p><em>Wolves v Brighton, Saturday 3pm</em></p><p><em>Fulham v Brentford, Saturday 3pm</em></p><p><em>West Ham v Chelsea, Sunday 4.30pm</em></p><p><em>Aston Villa v Everton, Sunday 2pm</em></p><p><em>Crystal Palace v Arsenal, Monday 8pm</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/18/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ireland head coach angry at what he called the human cost to families in the uproar over red card</p><p>These days sport’s leading coaches mostly prefer not to express their innermost private thoughts. Andy Farrell, as a former Great Britain rugby league captain, long ago earned his black belt in the art of politely disarming the media. Just occasionally, though, the time comes to ignore all that rubbish and call a spade a bloody shovel.</p><p>Which is what he did in no uncertain terms when asked about the recent chain of events surrounding his son Owen. To suggest the subsequent fallout has left him seething would be the understatement of the rugby year. On the one hand, he is head coach of Ireland, with a big warm-up game against England on Saturday to worry about. On the other he is a proud father, whose anger at those rushing to criticise “Faz Jr” can clearly be bottled up no longer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/18/andy-farrell-disgusting-circus-owen-farrell-ireland-rugby">Continue reading...</a>

Alexander-Arnold walked backwards, looked around, feigned a couple of throws, using the moment as a peg to reset his team’s shape, to let the lactic acid fade a little, to alter the balance of energies.

<p><strong>Assembly Rooms, Edinburgh</strong> <br />In an affecting set, the comic reflects on his younger brother’s death and the importance of holding loved ones close<br /></p><p>It is said that comedy is tragedy plus time – and it’s taken <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/sep/13/ed-byrne-i-laughed-so-much-i-burst-a-blood-vessel">Ed Byrne</a> time to address the death last year of his brother, the comedy director Paul. So much time that three shows at last year’s fringe, each by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/sep/22/sarah-keyworth-lost-boy-review-soho-theatre">a bereft colleague of Paul’s,</a> got there first. That in no way diminishes the power of 51-year-old Ed’s account, which traces not only the younger man’s illness, hospitalisation and death, but the pair’s fraught relationship leading up to it. This is not, as Byrne himself is surprised to realise, a show about death so much as reconciliation – it’s about holding your loved ones close, despite everything, while you have the chance.</p><p>In the hands of a less experienced act, the comedy and tragedy might (and often do) make for a cumbersome mix. But there are no grinding gear shifts in Tragedy Plus Time, which is open about Byrne’s grief and regret while never letting them occlude the laughter.

<p>The Whitehall decision to return to pre-pandemic grading was premature, and unfair on a cohort whose education was defined by Covid</p><p>The students who this week collected their A-level results overcame a formidable set of challenges. The class of 2023 were plunged into their first formal examinations only this summer, having been awarded their GCSEs by teacher assessment due to the pandemic. They belong to a cohort that is still emerging from the huge social and psychological disruptions caused by the Covid years, as schools only gradually return to an even keel.</p><p>Those who made the grades they hoped for, and those who did the same in T-levels and BTecs, are therefore entitled to consider that an exceptional achievement. Those who did not were extremely unlucky to find themselves at the wrong end of highly unusual circumstances. The government’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/aug/17/a-level-results-in-england-show-biggest-drop-on-record" title="">decision</a> to reimpose pre-pandemic grading in England on this year group – an example not followed in Wales or Northern Ireland – was premature. As expected, the consequence was the biggest-ever decline in results, with the proportion of A* and A grades falling from 35.9% to 26.5%. At the other end of the scale, there was a sharp increase in the number of low grades awarded, compared with 2019.</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

<p>Ten years on from the slaughter of protesters in Cairo, Gen Sisi’s record is even grimmer</p><p>Ten years ago this week, having recently seized power in a coup, Gen Abdel Fatah al-Sisi commanded police and troops to crack down on mostly unarmed demonstrators in central Cairo. At least 817 people <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/12/egypt-massacre-rabaa-intentional-human-rights-watch" title="">died in the Rabaa massacre</a>, and probably more than 1,000. It was not only the end of the hope for supporters of the deposed government of the Muslim Brotherhood, and for others still committed to the principle of civilian leadership despite the growing authoritarianism of president Mohamed Morsi, ousted by Gen Sisi. It was not only another blow to the optimism and excitement of the Arab spring, already fatally wounded. It was also the beginning of a new era of repression, in which Gen Sisi would prove more merciless than his predecessor Hosni Mubarak. The slaughter at Rabaa set the template for his tyranny.</p><p>Remembering the dead is all the more important when there is no foreseeable prospect of accountability for the massacre. Though Human Rights Watch <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/08/14/egypt-raba-massacre-reverberates-10-years-later" title="">believes</a> the brutal killings are likely to constitute a crime against humanity, no member of the security forces has ever faced court over them.</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Burton had recently emerged from a detox programme, battling his demons and white-knuckling his sobriety. The fragility of Burton’s emotional and mental state was palpable, and Parkinson knew that this interview required a delicate touch. Throughout the interview, Parkinson radiated empathy and understanding. He approached Burton with genuine warmth, without judgment. He understood the power of his platform and recognised that this was not just another interview; it was an opportunity to give Burton a safe space to share where he was in his life.

Sign up now!</a></p><p>Liverpool have been conspicuously struggling to fill the big gap in their squad left by the summer departures of Jordan Henderson, Fabinho, James Milner, Naby Keïta and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Given not a single one of those players achieved anything positive last season – with the exception of some impressive bleep-test results in Milner’s case – you’d think this wouldn’t be too onerous a task. Anyone under 36 with two still-functioning legs and a work permit would be an instant upgrade. And yet the famous old bird has spent the last week flapping around with all the courtly grace of a man chasing his own hat in the wind, a golfer in hot pursuit of a trolley bound for that pond, a player hobbling off injured while warming up for their Werder Bremen debut. Whoops! There goes that dignity!

## ‘I was never interested in being famous’: dance legend Yvonne Rainer on her gloriously weird film career

<p>As a retrospective of her work opens in London, Rainer looks back at her journey from experimental choreographer to anarchic film-maker and back again</p><p>Yvonne Rainer is the iconoclastic choreographer who, beginning in the 60s, pioneered the deconstruction of modern dance in a manner closely associated with minimalist art. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/feb/21/yvonne-rainer-films-siobhan-davies">No Manifesto</a>, published in 1965 (“No to spectacle. No to virtuosity. No to transformations and magic and make-believe … no to moving or being moved”) announced <a href="https://geoffmcdonald.com/yvonne-rainer-no-manifesto/">a rejection of modern dance’s conventions</a> and cliches, in favour of a vocabulary of movement that prioritised the ordinary, alienating or plain over narrative structure and emotional projection. She turned to film-making when she felt that dance alone couldn’t express what she wanted to say, and produced more than a dozen uncompromising film works over three decades.</p><p>“Oh no,” says Rainer, 88, when I bring up No Manifesto, which she later disavowed, during our conversation at her Manhattan apartment. “That was a certain point in art history – the manifesto was a way of asserting yourself publicly. I never meant it to be a doctrine that would govern my decisions.” She moved on from it “almost immediately”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/17/yvonne-rainer-i-was-never-interested-in-being-famous-dance-legend-film">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Controversy over debunked elements of Oscar-winning drama The Blind Side won’t be the first time a film based on a true story has taken liberties with the truth</p><p>2009 seems like such a long time ago. Back then, a Hollywood studio could make a film like The Blind Side, about the righteous bravery of a real life wealthy white family who dared to adopt a troubled black teenager. And, back then, it was a sensation. The Blind Side made its money back ten times over. It won Sandra Bullock an Oscar. People loved that film.</p><p>And yet you’re unlikely to find another film that has aged quite so badly. Not only does watching The Blind Side often feel like you’ve accidentally wandered into a video installation at the National White Saviour Museum, but it now turns out that most of it might have been cobblers anyway.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/17/from-titanic-to-american-sniper-the-biggest-lies-in-fact-based-movies">Continue reading...</a>

It was television so great, its only possible rival was David Frost’s 1977 programmes with the disgraced former US president Richard Nixon.

<p><strong>Dego/Ridout/van der Heijden/Colli<br />(Chandos)<br /></strong>Violinist Francesca Dego, violist Timothy Ridout, cellist Laura van der Heijden and pianist Federico Colli combine character and grace in Mozart’s innovative quartets</p><p>Mozart’s two piano quartets were groundbreaking when they were written in the early 1780s. The addition of viola to the standard piano-trio texture opens up new sonorities, and the writing revels in new possibilities regarding the relationship between strings and keyboard. So should we think of them as extended piano trios or compact piano concertos? This new recording provides material with which to argue either way.</p><p>The lineup is something of a supergroup of rising soloists - the violinist <a href="https://www.francescadego.com/" title="https://www.francescadego.com">Francesca Dego</a>, violist <a href="https://www.timothyridout.com/" title="https://www.timothyridout.com">Timothy Ridout</a>, cellist <a href="https://www.lauravanderheijden.uk/en" title="https://www.lauravanderheijden.uk/en">Laura van der Heijden </a>and pianist <a href="https://www.federicocolli.eu/" title="https://www.federicocolli.eu">Federico Colli</a>. Together they are as balanced a team as one could ask for, Ridout’s viola singing out as warmly and almost as brightly as Dego’s violin so that their exchanges are ideally weighted. The playing is imaginative and detailed; repeated sections are never done the same way twice, and the four play off each other in adding the odd ornament or decoration. There’s no real star: this is real chamber music. And yet, first among equals, Colli’s piano is the centre of gravity, setting the tone with quiet grace when he’s foregrounded, and sounding characterful and eloquent even when he’s in the background; he never has to push his way through.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/17/mozart-piano-quartets-review-rising-soloists-combine-elegance-and-eloquence">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The singer-songwriter and Bennett had a mutual respect when they met and formed a long-lasting friendship. lang talks about their radical duet, feeling safe with him and what she misses most</p><p>I met Tony backstage at the Grammy awards in 1992, but he already seemed omnipresent to me. Everybody knew Tony Bennett. He asked me to perform on his MTV Unplugged album in 1994 and the sparks started flying when we sang together. I felt elevated, comfortable and just in sync with him when we were doing Moonglow – as if I was with a teacher but also a friend. It was like an opening. It just felt right.</p><p>I always got the sense that Tony’s dedication to cultivating young artists to the Great American Songbook was driven by a desire to teach and develop the understanding of good songwriting and the symbiotic relationship between the singer and the song. I think he wanted young singers to experience the American Songbook and to set a standard in them, intuitively, about being a singer. I was a big fan of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/26/peggy-lee-perfect-is-that-all-there-is-coronavirus">Peggy Lee</a> and Carmen McRae so I was not a stranger to this music.

<p>After Barbie’s success, toy maker Hasbro has joined the goldrush – and soon even the dullest playtime object will get its own film. Are you ready for the Play-Doh Cinematic Universe?</p><p>One of the big yuks about this summer’s Barbenheimer hybrid event was that both Oppenheimer and Barbie were so completely different. One was colourful, the other was monochrome. One was joyous, the other incredibly serious. One had women who actually did stuff in it, the other was Oppenheimer. But with the benefit of hindsight, maybe the films had more in common than we thought. Oppenheimer, after all, was a film about decisions that had horrible consequences; about a huge and impressive feat that plunged the world into a state of overt and constant terror that has lasted for three quarters of a century. In other words: it was about Barbie.</p><p>Because, yes, look, Barbie was great. It was funny and smart and made more money than the human mind can imagine. But the consequences of Barbie are terrifying. On Wednesday, the entertainment wing of the toy company Hasbro <a href="https://newsroom.hasbro.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hasbro-announces-leadership-team-new-entertainment-division">put out a press release</a> announcing it was “evolving into the company’s next chapter of content creation”. Which, in other words, means that thanks to Barbie we’re all going to get lumped around the head by millions of toy movies until we die.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/17/what-next-after-barbie-hollywoods-nightmare-toy-movie-future-hasbro-play-doh">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Since a misjudged anorexia storyline in Skins, television has continued to glorify and glamorise eating disorders. I am so relieved that Netflix’s hit teen drama has finally got it right</p><p>When I look back at my teenage years, I remember being hungry. In the tangle of GCSE exam panic, awkward adolescence, angst and first love, I decided I had to take charge of my life in the only way I knew I properly could. At 16, I made the very active decision to stop eating. Lunchtimes stretched out into blank space. Before going to restaurants, I compulsively checked menus in search of the smallest thing I could stomach and still go unnoticed. Calories listed on the back of food packets demanded attention. Numbers, values and sums swarmed and swamped my head. Food was an all-consuming obsession, but I was empty.</p><p>The desire to avoid eating informed almost every decision I made. I came late to dinner plans, parroting that “I wasn’t that hungry” or that “I’d eaten at home”. I’d shamefully tip full plates of food into the bin, pretending I hadn’t let any go to waste. But however hard I pushed myself to skip snacks or adjust the levels of what I was allowed – and not allowed – to eat, my struggle was an internal, quiet and solitary one.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2023/aug/17/i-lived-with-an-eating-disorder-tv-almost-never-got-it-right-until-heartstopper">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Verve Records)</strong><br />The Grammy winner has amassed an array of international guest stars – reggaeton rappers, Lana Del Rey, Kenny G – for his vision of global pop, but the bland effect is more amiable than eclectic</p><p>You might have imagined that Jon Batiste’s triumph at the 2022 Grammy awards would be greeted with delight. He won more gongs than anyone else: five in total, becoming the first Black artist to win album of the year, for 2021’s We Are, in 14 years. Here was a virtuoso musician who existed on the margins of the mainstream – best-known as the bandleader on Stephen Colbert’s talkshow and the author of the “user-friendly jazz songs” from the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/13/soul-review-pixars-rapturous-tale-of-a-jazz-nut-on-a-surreal-out-of-body-journey">Disney film Soul</a> – hoisted into the spotlight by dint of his talent alone.</p><p>Instead, his success was more ambivalently received. Batiste, the naysayers suggested, was was a safe choice, more redolent of the past than the musical present. We Are had abandoned the traditionalist jazz found on his previous album, 2018’s Hollywood Africans, in favour of soul with a distinct retro flavour. Batiste, one writer complained, wasn’t “someone at the forefront of this century’s defining hip-hop and R&amp;B sounds”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/17/jon-batiste-world-music-radio-review-safety-first-global-pop-from-a-jazz-superstar">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Think carefully about your answers – because food choices can speak volumes</p><p>Look, I know it’s comfortable up there, but you really must get off the fence. You have to pick a side. I reached this conclusion for myself after staring at some bins in Manchester, because my life is glamorous. The bins, an initiative by the council designed to encourage people to chuck away their litter more effectively, had two slots. Each bore the name of a side in a debate. Were you, it asked, team Noel or team Liam? Were you Barbie or Oppenheimer? Chuck your litter in the appropriate slot. Digital counters racked up the votes. It was the third Manchester bin that caught my attention: a choice between barm or muffin. I am old enough to know that you don’t get involved in a fight between Mancunians over bread products. It’s their row. Leave it.</p><p>But there are many other binary choices in food and drink, and those we can get into. Obviously, some aren’t even worth discussing. It’s medium rare over well done. Of course it’s<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jan/13/nothing-worse-than-a-restaurant-that-makes-you-feel-like-an-old-git-jay-rayner"> printed menu over QR code.</a> And it has to be margherita over Hawaiian every time.

## Rolling Stones, wrong boarding passes and drunk tourists – take the Thursday quiz

<p>Fifteen questions on general knowledge and topical trivia, plus a few jokes, every Thursday. How will you fare?</p><p>This week the Thursday quiz starts off quite sombre, serious, political and topical, and gets more whimsical as it progresses. A bit like the progression of Doctor Who from the early days of William Hartnell to the technicolour of Colin Baker’s costume in the 1980s. If that reference has passed you by, never mind, maybe you will spot that the categories are all song titles again this week. But whose songs? Have fun, and let us know how you get on in the comments. And advance warning – the quiz master is away for the next few weeks so the quizzes are going to be pre-written and … weird.</p><p><strong>The Thursday quiz, No 121</strong></p><p><em>If you really do think there has been an egregious error in one of the questions or answers, feel free to email <a href="mailto:martin.belam@theguardian.com">martin.belam@theguardian.com</a>, or just go on social media and have a right royal moan up about it.</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/aug/17/the-guardian-thursday-quiz-general-knowledge-topical-news-trivia-121">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ex-president faces years of prison if convicted in Fulton county, but if case is moved to federal court it might result in dismissal of charges</p><p>After news broke on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/14/donald-trump-georgia-indictment-2020-election">Monday night</a> of Donald Trump’s indictment in Fulton county, Georgia, attention quickly turned to the possible spectacle of a trial unfolding on television as a former president attempts to rebut charges of racketeering and conspiracy over his efforts to overturn the results of an election.</p><p>But before the district attorney Fani Willis can have the opportunity to make her case against Trump with the cameras rolling, she must first clear a key procedural hurdle to keep the case in Fulton county. Trump’s legal team is expected to rely on a little known legal statute to argue the case should be moved to federal court, and that jurisdictional question could delay a trial for months. The stakes of that procedural fight will be high, as a conviction in Fulton county would leave Trump facing years of prison time with no clear pathway to a pardon.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/17/trump-georgia-indictment-trial-move-federal-court">Continue reading...</a>

## P.S. Burn This Letter Please by Craig Olsen review – tales from New York’s drag scene

<p>An eccentric retelling of the lives, loves and traumas of 1950s and 60s queens</p><p>Ed Limato was a razzle-dazzle agent who provided “the bridge between old-time Hollywood and Hollywood present”, according to his client Richard Gere. Decades earlier, Limato had been a confidant to the drag queens and “femme illusionists” who frequented New York’s underground joints such as 82 Club and the Cork Club in the 1950s and 60s, back when it was perilous and even illegal to cross-dress in public, and bars could be shut down if caught serving alcohol to a man in makeup. The queens, who labelled themselves the Boomatzas, wrote to Limato in fluent drag lingo, spilling the tea about what they had mopped, the current state of trade and the secrets of their pancake scene – terms that won’t need unpacking for gen Z readers raised on drag brunches, RuPaul and Paris Is Burning.</p><p>Four years after Limato’s death in 2010, these letters were found by Craig Olsen; he went on to produce the 2020 documentary P.S. Burn This Letter Please, which used new interviews with the surviving correspondents to create a moving portrait of the pre-Stonewall era where sisterhood flourished in the face of ubiquitous police brutality. Having helped bring the stories to life cinematically, Olsen now returns them to the page. He structures this version as a literary detective story, eliding any mention of the film so that we appear to be reading about how he researched this book – though it wasn’t proposed until <em>after</em> the movie’s premiere. As he tells it, his quest into New York’s drag herstory is inflamed by the memory of how Limato had once reacted angrily to a Polaroid of Olsen dressed as a woman. What was the old bird hiding? “I was determined to have my questions answered.” Fortunately for him, Limato lends the project his blessing from beyond the grave. “You found them, kid,” Olsen imagines him saying after he discovers the letters. “You found them!”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/17/ps-burn-this-letter-please-by-craig-olsen-review-tales-from-new-yorks-drag-scene">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In parenting there is little room for ambivalence, making it hard to get to the truth of anyone’s family life</p><p>On Sunday, the Radio 5 Live presenter <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/aug/14/helen-skelton-quits-radio-5-live-to-spend-more-time-with-her-children">Helen Skelton announced</a> she was hosting her last show for the time being, in order to step back from work to spend more time with her children. That phrase, with its ring of politicians getting in front of a scandal, is rarely used publicly with any sincerity and it was arresting to see it in this context. “I’m not all right about it,” said Skelton, prompted by her co-host Steve Crossman’s lachrymose farewell. “But you know, needs must.” With apparent reluctance, she said, “an eight-year-old will be happy about it”.</p><p>The striking thing about these remarks was Skelton’s willingness to admit to ambivalence. Parenting norms change, as do models of family and work, but the one consistency, seemingly arcing across the generations, is the need to persuade oneself that one’s choices around parenting aren’t merely reasonable but superior to whatever the alternatives may be. This mindset is particularly appealing to women, on whom the majority of caregiving responsibility still falls and on whose parenting choices judgment rests more heavily than it does for male partners. If you are going to be subject to criticism, internal or otherwise, you’d better be sure your position – to work or not work; to bottle or breastfeed; to co-sleep or kick them back to their own beds – is fully if not fanatically entrenched.</p><p>Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/17/helen-skelton-honesty-work-kids-radical-truth-family-life">Continue reading...</a>

It’s like being a kid again when you’re screaming and jumping over the waves.”</p><p>This summer, though, sewage alerts have forced her out of the water. Reidy, who is part of a group who swim at Cleveleys beach, a few miles north of the resort, has only been in a handful of times since mid-June, whereas normally she swam at least four times a week, wearing a wetsuit and gloves in the winter.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/aug/17/britains-swimmers-on-how-sewage-changed-their-summer">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Trapped on an oil rig with an unknowable horror’: Still Wakes the Deep is a dark 70s throwback

<p>The makers of Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture return with a story about drilling down into something terrible lurking beneath the North Sea</p><p>How do you fancy making a 1970s horror game set in Scotland? That was the question that art director John McCormack recalls being asked by Dan Pinchbeck, co-founder of the Brighton-based studio The Chinese Room, when he joined the company a few years ago. McCormack’s response was immediate: “Well, as a Scotsman from the 70s, I would say that you’ve got me: I’m in.”</p><p>McCormack had been attracted to work for the studio by its reputation for storytelling and authenticity. The Chinese Room made its name with the cult hit Dear Esther in 2012, and went on to create the Bafta-award-winning Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture in 2015, featuring an incredibly detailed recreation of a mysteriously deserted English village. Still Wakes the Deep carries on that tradition of faithful reproduction, although this time the setting is a North Sea oil rig rather than the bucolic English countryside.</p><p>Still Wakes the Deep will be out in 2024 on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/aug/17/trapped-on-an-oil-rig-with-an-unknowable-horror-still-wakes-the-deep-is-a-dark-70s-throwback">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh<br /></strong>Identity politics are deftly and hilariously tackled, with the help of a diamante-studded sporran, in a compelling show</p><p>Jodie Mitchell’s debut hour in some ways sticks to the mould of artist origin story. But in this show, we’re getting to know two people: Mitchell, plus their drag king alter ego John Travulva.</p><p>Mitchell skilfully weaves together drag, standup and an intriguing story about one weird day in this assured debut. They burst on to the stage as Travulva – Glaswegian accent, strong black beard, diamante-adorned sporran. Travulva is Scottish because Mitchell is Scottish, except, you wouldn’t know it to speak to them. When they were 10, a private school scholarship sent them down south, confusing their accent and class identity in the process. Mitchell is from a working-class family, but had an upper-class education – they feel “like a Greggs flat white”.</p><p>At <a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/jodie-mitchell-becoming-john-travulva">Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh</a>, until 27 August</p><p><a href="https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/stage/edinburgh-festival-2023">All our Edinburgh festival reviews</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/17/jodie-mitchell-becoming-john-travulva-review-skilful-weaving-of-drag-standup-and-storytelling">Continue reading...</a>

## Shark Heart by Emily Habeck – the man who turned into a shark

<p>This high-concept romantic debut explores the experience of facing life-changing and life-threatening conditions</p><p>Opposites, as the saying goes, attract. At first glance, the two lovers at the centre of Emily Habeck’s magical-realist debut, Shark Heart,<em> </em>bear this out. Quiet Wren works in “high finance”; Lewis is a high-school drama teacher with dreams of writing and acting in his own experimental plays. Wren was “better at meal planning and financial matters. Lewis was better with obscure pop culture references and spontaneous art projects … Wren’s favourite elements were … repetition, silence and predictability … Lewis was a man of enormous feeling.”<br /><br />In the early stages of their marriage, living in Texas, the couple find that their temperamental differences are sources of delight rather than conflict. Unexpected problems, however, soon surface. A few weeks after their “intimate and lovely but practical” wedding, Lewis notices changes to his body, physicality, mood and appetite. After tests and consultations, he is diagnosed with “Carcharodon carcharias mutation”. Lewis is becoming a shark. There is no cure.</p><p>There’s something absorbing and affecting about the novel’s concerns with the actualities of receiving and giving care. The central conceit of transformation seeks to capture the experiences of those facing life-changing or life-threatening conditions, and the estranging impacts these illnesses might have on sufferers and their loved ones alike. Lewis’s physical metamorphosis progresses rapidly and is described, through clear-eyed narration, in “agonising” detail: “The skin between his inner thighs conjoined … he was confined to a wheelchair … his bones were constantly fracturing. Daily living became an extended groan. And often a shout.” Wren undergoes a different, but still challenging, kind of adaptation – forced to take on the role of “mothering” her new husband as his developing shark instinct makes him increasingly bloodthirsty.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/17/shark-heart-by-emily-habeck-the-man-who-turned-into-a-shark">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Today’s fluff hangs from a trinket</p><p>Barcelona forward <strong>Ansu Fati</strong> has informed the club he wants out sooner rather than later. This news could see a three-way Premier League battle for his signature. <strong>Manchester United</strong>, <strong>Tottenham</strong> and <strong>Arsenal</strong> are all keen on the Spain international. Fati is frustrated about dropping down the pecking order in Catalonia and needs a fresh start if he is to fulfil his potential.</p><p>After running out on midfielders to sign, having missed out on Jude Bellingham, Moisés Caicedo and Roméo Lavia, <strong>Liverpool</strong> have turned to Stuttgart’s 30-year-old Japan international <strong>Wataru Endo</strong>, who can also play centre-back. He is expected to cost the Reds in the region of £16m and is likely to undergo a medical on Thursday, before completing his move. Another potential midfield arrival at Anfield is Fiorentina’s <strong>Sofyan Amrabat</strong>. The Moroccan has been heavily linked to Old Trafford but could move to Merseyside instead. And if that deal does not come off, there is always Crystal Palace midfielder <strong>Cheick Doucouré</strong>. Even by the standards of Liverpool’s window, it would be some going to not sign at least one of these three.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/17/football-transfer-rumours-ansu-fati-to-leave-barcelona-for-premier-league">Continue reading...</a>

## Strays review – Will Ferrell leads brutally funny comedy of foul-mouthed talking dogs

<p>With turns from Ferrell and Jamie Foxx, this  barking stoner caper follows a neglected animal plotting revenge on a beastly owner</p><p>The cute talking pigs of the Babe films taught audiences to love real animals with CGI human-talking mouths; I myself was always agnostic, finding them lacking in both the unadorned charm of live-action animals and the complete ingenuity of animations. But this brutally funny stoner comedy about four pottymouthed stray dogs on an incredible quest has changed my mind. You’ll believe a dog can talk – and be extremely abusive.</p><p>Writer-producer Dan Perrault, known chiefly for his true-crime docu-spoof American Vandal, and director, Josh Greenbaum, have created a cheerfully offensive comedy about stray dogs trekking across America, with their own issues around abuse, abandonment and emotional PTSD as well as who to hump and when. I like to think they were inspired by the much-loved 1963 live-action Disney classic The Incredible Journey about the English bull terrier, yellow labrador and Siamese cat that trek 300 miles across the Canadian wilderness to get home. In the Disney film, however, none of the animals were in jail, trying to extend their prodigious genitals through the cell bars in a nailbiting quest to unhook the keys.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/17/strays-review-will-ferrell-leads-brutally-funny-comedy-of-foul-mouthed-talking-dogs">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Dust is everywhere, but it’s so much more than a mere nuisance, as this eye-opening account shows</p><p>The subject of Jay Owens’s new book has long been trying to kill me. Like 300 million or so people around the world, I am asthmatic; what’s more, I am allergic to dust mites. As such, I have long considered dust an enemy, to be eradicated with the help of a vacuum cleaner or a swift wipe with a jiffy cloth. But Owens is out to broaden our perspective on what we might have thought of up to now as a mere nuisance. Dust contains multitudes, from minerals to the black carbon emitted by cars and industry, to “skin flakes, pet dander, hair, textile fibres … the dust under your sofa contains the world”.</p><p>Owens had chronicled her own obsession with dust in a newsletter, Disturbances, before writing this book, and brings to the subject a microscopist’s eye and an infectious zeal. Dust, we learn, is “always sub-millimetre in scale, and very often a hundred or thousand times smaller than that”. But as a result of its near invisibility, she says, nobody thinks about “what it might be doing or where it should go: it is so tiny, so totally, absolutely mundane, that is slips beneath the limits of vision”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/17/dust-by-jay-owens-review-the-stuff-that-surrounds-us">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This exhilarating, nine-hour journey trundles through the Swiss and Austrian Alps and soars to more than 1,000 metres above sea level as it crosses the Rhine-Danube watershed</p><p>Every great railway station needs a guardian angel. Zurich has one of the quirkiest. A colourful sculpture of a curvaceous, swimsuit-clad woman with golden wings hovers over the main concourse at the city’s Hauptbahnhof. <em>L’ange protecteur</em> by French artist Niki de Saint Phalle is as intriguing as the busy departure boards. With direct trains to destinations across 10 countries, this station is rich in possibilities. Anywhere from Amsterdam to Zagreb! Berlin, Bratislava or Bologna? Or perhaps Paris or Prague?</p><p>For lovers of fine scenery, the star departure of the day is, in my opinion, the 08.40 to Graz. This EuroCity train includes an Austrian restaurant car and one of the rare panorama carriages owned by Swiss operator SBB. There’s only one other international departure from Zurich which offers such panoramic delight: the EC8 at 10.59 to Hamburg. There are some fine scenic stretches on that route to be sure, most notably the hour-long cruise down the Rhine Gorge from Mainz to Koblenz. But that cannot compete with the EC163 to Graz which, if you excuse a few tunnels, offers over nine hours of first-class Alpine scenery on its journey of 325 miles (522km) to Austria’s second city.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/aug/17/rail-route-of-the-month-zurich-to-graz">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Extreme health regimes aren’t always bad for you, but they are less difficult for men than expressing their hopes and fears</p><p>When I was in my early 20s, I owned a duffel bag full of sand. Correction: I owned a duffel bag full of sandwich bags full of sand, each duct-taped closed so that I could easily add them to or remove them from the larger bag when I was taking it outside to do squats and hill sprints. In my mind, this was a perfectly reasonable thing to do, a view I questioned only when one of my friends, helping me to move house, said: “Ooh, this is heavy, what’s in this one?” Reader, they were <em>furious</em>.</p><p>I mention this not to show off, but to establish my credentials before the next bit. I did a lot of stupid things in my 20s, purely because they were easier than learning to talk to people. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/05/ice-baths-in-january-why-science-suggests-we-ditch-all-the-self-flagellation">A lot of young men do</a>.

## Tadiwa Mahlunge: Inhibition Exhibition review – an impressive debut

<p><strong>Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh<br /></strong>The standup delivers an energetic set about trying to live up to his parents’ expectations and the ethics of his corporate day job</p><p>“I am unhinged!” There’s nervous energy to burn in Tadiwa Mahlunge’s show, which traces the 25-year-old Welsh Zimbabwean’s need for validation from his high-standards upbringing (family motto: “Achieve or Die”) to his overworked adulthood. Mahlunge is a man on several missions: to impress his African parents, “obliterate his enemies”, and make us all laugh. At least one of those ambitions is accomplished by this fringe debut, Inhibition Exhibition. As he bounces around the stage, his comedy is forthright, self-mocking and fizzy.</p><p>There is an arresting mix of high anxiety and loud-and-proud delivery, as Mahlunge outlines the slight remove at which he sits from his family, his profession, fellow black people and more. Arriving in the UK as a refugee from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/06/robert-mugabe-obituary">Robert Mugabe</a> (his mum co-founded the opposition alliance Movement for Democratic Change), Mahlunge has been set an example of probity, hard work and moral strength that is impossible to live up to. He’s trying – hence the posh accent, which leads pals in the barbershop to call him “white boy”. His upbringing, however, rules out living on the meagre proceeds of standup comedy, and so Mahlunge details his high-flying day jobs – and the ethics he has shelved to maintain them.</p><p>At <a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/tadiwa-mahlunge-inhibition-exhibition">Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh</a>, until 27 August</p><p><a href="https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/stage/edinburgh-festival-2023">All our Edinburgh festival reviews</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/17/tadiwa-mahlunge-inhibition-exhibition-review-pleasance-courtyard-edinburgh-festival">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Having built his reputation as a comic and podcaster on his candour about anxiety and addiction, Robins is facing a new comedy challenge – happiness</p><p>‘There is no greater sorrow,” as Dante had it, “than to recall happiness in times of misery.” If the converse is true, then John Robins is cooking up some divine comedy. Robins – best known now as one half of an all-conquering talk-radio twosome with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/oct/26/elis-james-funniest-things">Elis James</a> – has a new touring show, the first since the pre-pandemic <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/04/john-robins-review-pleasance-courtyard-edinburgh-festival-2019">Hot Shame</a>. Like its predecessor, and like much of the pair’s podcast work, it addresses mental health – specifically, Robins’ lifelong battle against high anxiety. But this time there’s a twist.</p><p>“One half of the show was written last year,” says Robins, “in quite a catastrophic phase, mentally. And the second half is being written now, when as you can tell,” he smiles, only a little ironically, “I’m very serene and peaceful.” This year has seen the 41-year-old turn a corner with his wellbeing. A man whose standup routines mainline disastrous failure at basic life management – whether that’s a breakup in his award-winning <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/aug/15/john-robins-review-edinburgh-festival-sara-pascoe">The Darkness of Robins</a>, or simply buying a humidifier in Hot Shame – has now quit alcohol, taken up meditation and is learning to be less “in-self”.
