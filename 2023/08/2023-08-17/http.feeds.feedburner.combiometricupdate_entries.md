<img alt="Telos ID, Alclear join Idemia in delivering TSA PreCheck screening enrollment" class="attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="682" src="https://d1sr9z1pdl3mb7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/13121848/Telos-ID-Alclear-join-Idemia-in-delivering-TSA-PreCheck-screening-enrollment.jpeg" width="1024" />
		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/telos-id">Telos Corporation</a> has opened 10 locations for people to enroll their biometrics and sign up for membership to the U.S. Transportation Security Administration’s (TSA’s) expedited security clearance service.

The company is the second to launch TSA PreCheck enrollment services, according to the announcement. Telos has already enrolled individuals in trials at Annapolis, Md., Chantilly, Va., Ashburn, Va. and Las Vegas.

Online membership renewals can be performed through Telos or <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/idemia">Idemia</a>, regardless of which performed the initial enrollment.

“This expansion of enrollment providers will increase the network of locations where applicants may go to complete their TSA PreCheck membership,” says TSA Administrator David Pekoske.

PreCheck membership allows travellers to keep their shoes and belts on and their electronics and liquids in their bags, and go through faster screening in dedicated lanes.

The TSA is also reducing the number of <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/clear">Clear</a> members it is planning to put through extra identity verification, reports <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2023/08/10/tsa-clear-enhanced-id-checks/">The Washington Post</a>.

Sources told the Post about a letter sent to Clear by the TSA, which revises the agency’s goal from vetting the identity of all Clear members, something which it had not carried out, according to the Post. That policy change was implemented after <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/clear-spars-over-tsa-report-after-security-incident-follows-enrollment-error">security incidents</a> involving Clear members were discovered.

The TSA will still check the identity of more Clear members than it has in the past. How many is unclear, but <em>Biometric Update</em> has requested details from Clear and will update this story if they are provided.

		Germany is doing away with children's paper passports in favor of biometric documents with embedded electronic chips beginning next year.

The children’s passports had to be renewed annually and cost a one-time fee of €13 (approximately US$14.13) with €6 annual renewals. The electronic passport will cost €37.50 ($40.77), but it is valid for up to six years for Germans up to 25 years old, <a href="https://www.focus.de/finanzen/news/schon-ab-2024-kinderreisepass-wird-abgeschafft-das-muessen-eltern-jetzt-wissen_id_198813746.html">according to</a> Google's machine translation of reporting by the news publication Focus Online.

The children’s passports did not include the security chips or fingerprint biometrics required for acceptance in the U.S., Australia, and some African countries, and the photo could be updated, unlike a biometric passport.

Parents can request an <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/eu-countries-have-right-to-record-biometrics-on-id-cards-says-top-court-adviser">ID card</a> for children up to 11 years old. This car can be used for travel within the European Union, the Schengen area and Switzerland.

## Bit by bit, Mitek fights Nasdaq delisting. Decision due in weeks

		Biometric software maker Mitek is still technically at odds with its securities listing exchange, Nasdaq. Still unable to file its previous three financial reports, Mitek could face being delisted.

There has been some progress on the company's part. It's most recent annual report for the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/miteks-much-delayed-financials-show-a-loss-but-a-gain-for-revenue">fiscal year</a> ended September 30 has been filed. As for the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/miteks-nasdaq-suspension-stayed-final-delisting-hearing-next-month">three previous quarters</a>, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/mitek-systems-inc">Mitek</a> only says it intends to get them together.

A firm being delinquent with any required report can result in trading being suspended or ended indefinitely. Without the timely production of the numerous standardized messages and reports that the Nasdaq (and the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission), investors cannot make informed buy or sell decisions.

A Nasdaq panel met with Mitek executives August 10 to hear the company's plans to get current, and, according to Mitek, a final decision is expected later this month or next.

		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/deloitte">Deloitte</a> has won another contract with the UK’s Government Digital Service (GDS) to develop software for and train government staff on developing the One Login service, with 16 million pounds (approximately US$20.4 million), <a href="https://www.publictechnology.net/2023/08/17/economics-and-finance/gds-signs-16m-deal-to-support-one-login-delivery/">PublicTechnology</a> reports.

The Gov.uk service provides secure access to online government services, and is supposed to unify access to all public services, but a recent assessment shows it has <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/uks-one-login-still-has-competition-in-government">a long way to go</a>.

Under the new contract, Deloitte will provide skills training and support to government workers.

A performance indicator specified in the contract is the promotion of collaborative, transparent working relationship and passing knowledge and skills along to GDS staff.

The deal came into effect on July 20 and is set to last for a year, with an option for an additional year-long extension.

During the time, One Login implementation is expected to expand rapidly, with the goal of covering most services offered by all government departments within the next 18 months, according to PublicTechnology.

The contract follows <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202303/multimillion-pound-contracts-keep-coming-for-uk-government-digital-services-one-login">two other wins for Deloitte</a> to work on One Login earlier this year, and worth a combined £14.5 million ($18.5 million). Deloitte also makes the One Login <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202202/uk-government-selects-deloitte-to-produce-one-login-digital-identity-app">mobile app</a>.

Deloitte contracts for One Login now total above £35 million, out of £305 million ($388 million) spent on the program so far.

## Uganda launches inclusive digital govt roadmap to facilitate access to services

		Uganda has unveiled a digital transformation plan which details how the government intends to offer public services to citizens no matter who they are or where they are found.

The <a href="https://ict.go.ug/programmes/digital-transformation-roadmap/">Digital Transformation Roadmap</a>, supported by the United Nations Development Program and launched August 17, hinges on five key pillars, according to the Permanent Secretary at the Ministry for ICT and National Guidance, Aminah Zawedde.

In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fJmFkbPGZ4">a video</a> published by NTV Uganda, Zawedde explained that the pillars of the plan include skills development, digital services, cybersecurity, innovation and entrepreneurship, and the enabling environment and infrastructure.

She said apart from building an inclusive digital future where Ugandans of all social class and status will be able to have access to digital services, the plan is also aimed at providing those to be employed by the public services skills which will be needed to better render digital services.

“Digital skilling will be a requirement just like we have mathematics and English in primary and secondary schools,” said Zawedde, who also noted that the skilling program will see certificates awarded to trainees.

“For ICT, we are coming up with a certificate programme and we are recommending it to the Ministry of Public Service and the Public Service Commission. We encourage people to have this certificate as we do recruitments. Those who are in government currently are going to be trained and given the certificates. That way, we will ensure that the uptake of services is guaranteed.”

Further explaining the kernel of the digital roadmap, Zawedde said: “We are looking forward to growing the manufacturing industry of ICT equipment and devices in order for us to uptake digital services. We have a number of engagements with the telecoms companies as well as the private sector to see how we can come up with low-cost devices. You know, it’s after we have the devices that we can get people to join the digital transformation journey.”

The plan also includes goals of connecting 90 percent of Ugandan households to the internet by 2040, and moving 95 percent of government services online, the <a href="https://nilepost.co.ug/2023/08/17/govt-to-connect-90-of-ugandan-households-to-internet-in-new-digital-transformation-roadmap/">Nile Post</a> reports.

The country’s digital identity system, meanwhile, is being <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202303/uganda-court-accepts-brief-from-rights-groups-on-digital-id-case">challenged in court</a> on grounds that it undermines Ugandans’ rights.

This development comes as the government is pushing ahead with a constitutional and electoral reform agenda. Among the proposed electoral reforms is the introduction of biometrics in the country’s electoral process ahead of the 2026 general polls.

The East African <a href="https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/news/east-africa/uganda-2026-polls-roadmap-4333852">reports</a> that this was one of the recommendations of the Constitutional Court when it ruled on petitions during the 2016 presidential election which was disputed.

Another proposal has to do with changes to rules on the determination of citizenship, which could affect the status of stateless persons in the country, the outlet notes.

A Ugandan government spokesperson recently sounded an alarm on the high rate of <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/rate-of-foreigners-acquiring-ugandan-national-id-is-alarming-govt-official-warns">foreigners acquiring the country’s national ID</a> for passport applications.

		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/supercom-ltd">SuperCom</a>, through its subsidiary, Leaders in Community Alternatives (LCA), has secured a contract to provide alcohol monitoring technologies and related services in California. The contract is valued at up to $3 million over three years.

SuperCom says in an announcement that the deal, which is already running, is expected to last until 2026, with the possibility of an extension. Revenue from the contract is based on a per-unit daily rate.

The alcohol monitoring capability provided by SuperCom is part of its <a href="https://www.supercom.com/em-solutions">PureSecurity</a> suite, which also includes face, fingerprint and voice biometrics to authenticate the user.

The new contract is an important milestone for its U.S. market expansion ambitions and strengthens the company’s position as a prominent long-term partner in the criminal justice sector, according to the announcement.

Ordan Trabelsi, CEO and president of SuperCom stated, “We are proud to have been chosen once again to support California's criminal justice system. Our long-standing relationships with county customers and law enforcement underscores their trust in our technology and services.”

Trabelsi added as the business moves forward, it will continue to establish and consolidate useful partnerships, while “driving technological advancements, and delivering top-tier solutions that address the unique challenges faced by the criminal justice system.”

This contract announcement follows a<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/big-revenue-increases-and-a-public-placement-for-supercom"> recent announcement</a> of significant revenue growth and new projects which include biometrics in other countries.

		A new facial recognition system from <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/idemia-nss">Idemia National Security Solutions (NSS</a>) has been implemented at Gate 10 of Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, to provide remote enrollment and multi-person facial recognition capabilities. This <a href="https://www.army.mil/article/269086/redstone_arsenal_research_project_needs_volunteers">trial effort</a> is part of an initiative to enhance and streamline security processes at the site.

The Army Corps of Engineers and the Engineer Research and Development Center are managing the project, with execution by Idemia NSS. The trial will test remote enrollment capabilities, allowing individuals to validate their identities before arriving at the base, potentially bypassing the Visitor Control Center. Users will enroll on their smartphone through an app.

Additionally, the project aims to broaden face biometrics technology to multi-occupant vehicles, a significant extension from the current system being trialed at other gates limited to single-occupant vehicles.

Redstone Arsenal was the first base to deploy Idemia NSS’ ID2Access solution, using digital ID and AI for a frictionless base experience, in 2022, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/IdemiaNss/status/1512055934851244032">a tweet</a> from the company.

As part of this research, images of volunteers will be captured and analyzed. These images will be retained until the project concludes, with an end date set for Jan. 31, 2024.

Former Idemia NSS CEO Andrew Boyd explained the company’s vision for <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202012/real-time-facial-recognition-and-remote-biometrics-combine-in-idemia-nss-installation-of-the-future">real-time facial recognition</a> to secure military base access back in 2020, ahead of a trial deployment of facial recognition at <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202103/u-s-army-trials-face-biometric-access-gates-to-secure-redstone-arsenal">Redstone gates 1 and 9</a> in 2021.

		The Digital India program that includes the national digital identity, Aadhaar, as well as public sector systems for biometric authentication and online government services, is receiving a funding boost, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/centre-to-expand-digital-india-programme-525000-it-professionals-to-undergo-upskilling/articleshow/102770054.cms">The Economic Times</a> reports.

More than 149 billion Indian rupees (US$1.79 billion) has been earmarked over the next five years by the Cabinet of the country’s central government to upgrade and expand the program.

The funding will support skills improvement for more than 600,000 information technology professionals, expand a government translation tool to cover more Indian languages, and support digital startups across the country.

In addition to Aadhaar, DigiLocker, the Unified Payment Interface and e-Hastakshar e-signature service, Digital India also includes the single sign-on platform for digital government services, MeriPehchaan, launched last July.

The funds will also be used to extend DigiLocker to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises to enable the verification of documents it stores for credit applications and services, according to <a href="https://www.onmanorama.com/news/india/2023/08/17/digital-india-expansion.html">Manorama</a>.
<h2>Governance of digital public infrastructure</h2>
Amitabh Kant, former CEO of public policy thinktank NITI Aayog and current <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/?posttype=all&amp;s=India+G20">India G20</a> Sherpa, told <a href="https://www.cnbctv18.com/technology/digital-public-infrastructure-first-time-a-developing-nation-has-devised-a-tech-solution-says-amitabh-kant-17559711.htm">CNBC-TV18</a> in an interview that the adoption of digital public infrastructure (DPI) has created a governance gap.

India’s approach to bridging that gap, Kant says, is based on the use of open source technology and open API interoperability.

Kant says an international architecture is needed to address the absence of a defined governance structure for DPI. He also suggests that the value of DPI is universally accepted among the G20.

The next step is for those countries to come together with others in the global south, and international institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, to collaborate on the necessary governance structure.

		X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, is rumored to have introduced a new selfie biometrics and ID document verification process, according to app researcher<a href="https://twitter.com/nima_owji/status/1691850092385370483"> Nima Owji (@nima_owji)</a>. Owji notes via screenshots that the new identity verification process will require users to take a selfie and photograph a government-issued ID. These images will be sent to third-party service<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/au10tix"> Au10tix</a>, which will handle face biometrics matching. It is reported that X will store these images for a maximum of 30 days.

This new feature is especially noteworthy for Blue/Premium subscribers, as verification will become mandatory to access premium features. For other users, biometric ID verification appears to be optional, according to platform news account<a href="https://twitter.com/xDaily/status/1691867855317500000?t=GJHNlR4RKm1k_p7qqJQgLg&amp;s=19"> X News Daily</a>.

According to the screenshot, the identity verification process is expected to take about 5 minutes.

This move follows the platform's<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202304/options-for-verification-of-personhood-online-growing-twitter-still-pretending"> recent efforts</a> to increase user accountability and foster a more trustworthy and secure online environment and is inevitable, given the platform’s “<a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/4/18/23687125/elon-musk-twitter-x-super-app-wechat">super app</a>” ambitions. Critics are raising concerns about potential privacy issues associated with storing sensitive personal information.
<h2>Microsoft Advertising implements ID document verification</h2>
Microsoft Advertising has announced a<a href="https://help.ads.microsoft.com/apex/index/3/en/60109"> new policy</a> requiring all advertisers to complete Advertiser Identity Verification (AIV) to continue displaying ads to audiences worldwide. Before ads can be served, new advertising accounts must undergo this document verification process. This move aims to ensure accuracy, transparency and accountability in the digital advertising ecosystem, providing consumers with a clearer understanding of the entities behind online ads.

For individuals, the process includes submitting an ID document along with a facial photo, though biometric comparison is not explicitly mentioned.

Over the coming months, established accounts will be gradually opted into the new Advertiser Identity Verification (AIV) requirement. This rollout may pause ads for unverified existing customers flagged for risk or unresolved policy violations. Completing the AIV process is the initial step toward potential appeal and reinstatement for suspended accounts.

This policy update by Microsoft Advertising is a significant step toward protecting both consumers and legitimate businesses from potential risks associated with anonymous, fraudulent or misleading advertising.

## US nearing ‘hypergrowth’ for South African authentication firm Entersekt

		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/entersekt">Entersekt</a>, a South Africa-based transaction authentication software maker, says its fiscal 2023 performance in the United States "is nearing hypergrowth."

Executives with the company, who focus on serving financial institutions, say in a statement that customer growth in the U.S. has been almost 220 percent in fiscal 2023.

Contracted annual recurring revenue outside its South Africa home market, according to executives, has risen by 191 percent over the same period. The company also was awarded a <a href="https://patents.justia.com/patent/11538034">patent</a> that is significant to continued growth, according to the announcement.

"Our reputation [is] delivering the highest level of security to financial institutions across all digital channels without compromising user experience,” Entersekt CEO Schalk Nolte says in a statement.

The patent underlies Entersekt's Context Aware authentication API, which combines third-party integrators and silent and active authenticators, like face and fingerprint biometrics. It is designed, according to the company, to provide a simplified user experience while strengthening security.

Nolte says <a href="https://www.entersekt.com/">the software</a> considers patterns in user interactions such as authentication preferences, reasons for logins and purchases, channels of engagement, transaction history and user behavior to prevent fraud while reducing transaction abandonment rates.

He says banks among his clients "have one common authentication platform across all the various channels. Not only does this provide a much better user and customer experience, but also helps orchestrate all that data to help banks make better decisions.”

Also, this fiscal year, Nolte has hired 10 <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202301/new-ceos-appointed-at-3-biometrics-providers">top-level executives</a>, including Matt Loos as chief revenue officer, Pradheep Sampath as chief product officer and Frank Moreno as chief marketing officer.

		European Union officials have put out for bid a research report about how member states are using remote facial recognition in police work and how the practice is affecting fundamental rights.

The EU <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/eu-rights-agency-says-impact-of-large-biometric-systems-partly-unknown">Agency for Fundamental Rights</a> has budgeted up to €350,000 (US$381,000) for the <a href="https://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:498765-2023:TEXT:EN:HTML&amp;tabId=1#id1-II.">contract</a> and expects it to last 11.5 months. Bids must be submitted by September 29.

<a href="https://etendering.ted.europa.eu/cft/cft-document.html?docId=154853#caDetails">Agency</a> officials want to hear about six ongoing law enforcement use cases being tested or that have been deployed in at least four member states.

The final list of six use cases will be made by the officials and could include remote biometric identification in public or privately owned spaces and crowd control.

The biometric surveillance systems can be designed to prevent imminent threats including terrorism and other serious crimes or to locate crime victims.

Qualitative fieldwork including interviews with law enforcement agency personnel, businessowners, national human rights leaders, civil society groups and government officials charged with protecting public data is expected to inform the report.

Remote biometric identification was one of the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/eu-parliament-approves-ai-act-amid-heated-biometrics-debates">main points of contention</a> in the formulation of the EU’s AI Act.

		Pakistan’s legislature is considering a data protection bill that defines biometrics as “sensitive personal data” and mandates the creation of a regulatory framework for special permissions relating to biometric data.

<a href="https://privacyinternational.org/news-analysis/5090/privacy-international-raises-concerns-regarding-pakistans-personal-data">Privacy International</a> (PI) says the bill contains “vague exceptions allowing the government to evade responsibility and deny individuals’ ability to exercise their rights to access their data and submit a complaint,” and would not grant the data protection authority sufficient independence to enforce the law. The bill also contains a data localization clause, which the rights group calls part of a “worrying trend.” PI also worries that the terms “national security,” “public interest” and “legitimate interest” are doing a lot of work, despite no definition for the former and broad definitions for the latter two terms.

The draft of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2023 received Federal Cabinet approval in late July and is headed towards votes in the National Assembly and Senate.

The <a href="https://moitt.gov.pk/SiteImage/Misc/files/Final%20Draft%20Personal%20Data%20Protection%20Bill%20May%202023.pdf">version published on May 19</a> by the Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication is described as “final,” and is the latest version made available to the public, though it is not known if this is the same version approved by Cabinet.

PI says that over five years of tracking the Bill’s development, various versions have moved progressively closer to international practices and principles for data protection.

The bill would establish the National Commission for Personal Data Protection (NCPDP), which would have the creation of the compliance frameworks for biometrics, data breaches and audits, data protection impact assessments, grievance redressal and cross-border data sharing, among 15 areas. It also sets out requirements for obtaining permission to process the data of children under 18 years old, and establishes rights for people to access, correct and erase data about them.

The World Bank has commented that the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202302/pakistan-id-boss-to-head-undp-digital-transformation-committee-as-world-bank-mulls-funding">draft would need to be amended</a> to align it with global best practices.
