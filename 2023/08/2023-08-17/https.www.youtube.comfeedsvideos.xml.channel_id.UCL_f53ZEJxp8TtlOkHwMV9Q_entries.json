Peterson and 2024 presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy discuss his ongoing campaign, the long-growing hunger for depth in political discussion, the dire need for a renewed American vision, and how Vivek plans to strip the Washington administrative agencies of their unconstitutional powers.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy is an entrepreneur, author, and political activist. Vivek has been making headlines since announcing his candidacy for the 2024 presidential election, running on a platform in part to dismantle the expansive and corrupt bureaucracy that has seeped into nearly all facets of American government. Prior to this, Ramaswamy was the founder and CEO of the biopharmaceutical company Roivant Sciences. Leaving in 2021, he published \u201cWoke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam.\u201d In 2022, he co-founded Strive Asset Management with Anson Frericks, which focuses on an alternative to the now-pushed ESG investment framework. That same year Ramaswamy published \u201cNation of Victims: Identity Politics, the Death of Merit, and the Path Back to Excellence.\u201d and has since been deemed one of the \u201cIntellectual Godfathers of the anti-woke movement.\u201d\n\nExodus will be available for a limited time on YouTube, so be sure to watch as new episodes release each Monday - https://youtu.be/GEASnFvLxhU\n\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nPreBorn!: Help save 11,000 babies from abortion: https://preborn.com/Jordan\n\nShopify: Get a $1/ month FREE trial with full access to Shopify's entire suite of features: https://shopify.com/jbp\n\n\n- Links -\n\nFor Vivek Ramaswamy:\n\nFor more information on Vivek\u2019s campaign:  https://www.vivek2024.com/ \n\n\n- Chapters -\n\n(0:00) Coming up\n(0:28) Intro\n(1:13) Don\u2019t dumb yourself down\n(6:38) A mistake by the Republicans\n(10:26) Short form media is entertainment\n(11:21) Starved for connection\n(14:00) Where podcasting has advanced beyond books\n(17:05) Campaign spending and how it impacts success\n(20:40) People know they are being lied to, a revolutionary moment\n(25:12) Where Trump went wrong\n(28:43) 75 percent of Washington bureaucrats will be fired\n(35:10) A perfect intersection: science, law, business\n(44:36) What would our founding fathers say?\n(47:12) The U.S. President needs to have this ability\n(51:07) What Vivek wants to be able to tell his children\n(52:53) What a renewed America will look like\n(57:27) We need to be a nation under God\n(1:01:14) Alternatives to tyranny, the hierarchy of importance\n(1:06:07) A reawakening of American values\n(1:10:02) Balancing family responsibility with ambition\n(1:19:06) Your sanity is a socially negotiated phenomena\n(1:21:24) Preaching what you practice\n(1:24:00) When someone who loves you pushes you\n(1:27:13) The beneficial adversary, choosing who you marry\n(1:38:39) Speak the truth without attachment to the result\n\n\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlTY7VzqBwc", "date_published": "2023-08-17T15:00:47+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/rlTY7VzqBwc/hqdefault.jpg"}]
