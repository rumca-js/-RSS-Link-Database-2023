Opening the show with \u201cPatio de la C\u00e1rcel,\u201d he trades synthetic beats for transitive horns and lays bare his soul with vivid bars about life in his barrio. Locking in his audience with a heart-thumping trombone line, he switches to flamenco-driven \u201cMeti\u00f3 en un L\u00edo.\u201d Settling back into the beat of clapping hands, he and his band dance through the up-tempo \u201cLa Llama del Amor.\u201d \n\nOmar Montes walked into the building on a video call with his grandma \u2014 one of the most important people in his life. He closes out his performance with \u201cConmigo,\u201d infused with the kind of romance you\u2019d imagine his abuela taught him. \u201cFor you I would bring down the moon,\u201d he coos. The Spanish artist exudes tradition and soul as he centers his barrio, his people, his familia in his show \u2014 bringing a little piece of Spain to the rest of the world.\n\nSET LIST\n\u201cPatio de la C\u00e1rcel\u201d\n\u201cMeti\u00f3 en un L\u00edo\u201d\n\u201cLa Llama del Amor\u201d\n\u201cConmigo\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nOmar Montes: vocals\nOscar Barrul: vocals, palms\nJose del Curro: vocals, palms\nAlejandro Paez: electric bass\nCesar Galvez: flamenco guitar\nEduardo Figueroa: flamenco cajon\nMarcos Ortega: trumpet\nJavier Campos: saxophone, flute\nRoberto Lorenzo: trombone\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Anamaria Sayre\nDirector/Editor: Kara Frame\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nCreative Director: Bob Boilen\nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Maia Stern, Sofia Seidel\nAudio Assistant: Kwesi Lee\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Ashley Pointer, Hazel Cills\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #omarmontes", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rmg040Su5R8", "date_published": "2023-08-17T09:00:30+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/Rmg040Su5R8/hqdefault.jpg"}]
