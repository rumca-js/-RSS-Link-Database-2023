Here, in part three, we're going to move ahead to the next phase of the franchise, which kicks off a new arc and introduces a new main villain for the heroes to contend with. \n\nAfter the defeat of Shao Kahn in Mortal Kombat 3, Mortal Kombat 4 turns its attentions to a new central threat: Shinnok- but before we get into the events of the game itself, we first need to turn the clock back a little bit and talk about Shinnok himself, and about how he got to the point where we find him in Mortal Kombat 4.\n\nPlease consider subscribing for more awesome videos! https://www.youtube.com/@GamingBolt?sub_confirmation=1\n\nLinks to Part 1 and Part 2:\n\nPart 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IgnFexLLHY\nPart 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXiNCL5FM2g\n\nTime stamps:\n\nIntro 00:00\nA New Enemy in the form of Shinnok 0:18\nThe Story of Mortal Kombat 4 3:55\nThe Story of Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance 9:25\nThe End 15:59\n\nGames Information:\n\nMortal Kombat 4\nRelease Date: First available on September 11, 1997\nPlatforms: Microsoft Windows, N64, PlayStation\n\nMortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance\nRelease Date: First available on November 22, 2002\nPlatforms: GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIhR_NjZBc8", "date_published": "2023-08-03T15:30:11+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/wIhR_NjZBc8/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon - 15 More NEW Things You Need To Know BEFORE YOU PURCHASE", "description": "FromSoftware has established itself as one of the most prestigious and consistent developers in the industry by now, and even though its next game is going to be quite different from the sort of experiences it did that on the back of, it still warrants plenty of attention- which, of course, it has been getting in spades. \n\nArmored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon has generated its fair share of buzz and excitement in the build up to its release later this month, and as we count the days down to the day it launches, there continues to be no shortage of things to talk about.
