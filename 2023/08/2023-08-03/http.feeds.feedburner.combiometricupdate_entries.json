Integration of our work with theirs will enhance and accelerate this important effort.\u201d\n\n\u201cInspired by the documentary Meena, we established ID2020 to be a time-bound exploration of alternative systems for individuals to prove they exist,\u201d explains ID2020 Co-founder John Edge. \u201cWe believed emerging decentralized technologies could provide services to vulnerable individuals while safeguarding their safety and security. Ultimately, we focused on advocating for re-engineered systems that align with our evolving understanding of the interplay between society and technology. With global awareness and engagement on this issue now mainstream, and efforts increasingly directed to the practical implementation of solutions, it is an ideal time for the Digital Impact Alliance to take the lead.\u201d\n\nThe Digital Impact Alliance, a leading advocate for digital transformation since 2014, emphasizes prioritizing people. Collaborating with governments, policymakers, and technologists, the alliance has created a myriad of resources on effective digital public infrastructure and data governance.

The people and process, however, can be very different from to another.\n\n\u201cThis is true for any platform or any product,\u201d Santhanam points out. \u201cThe technology aspect is the same, but the country takes it and tailor-makes it for their country. So that\u2019s where the process and the people aspect really comes into play.\u201d\n\nMorocco has roughly 38 million residents, mostly concentrated in urban areas. The Philippines has a population of 110 million spread across thousands of islands, making centralized registration processes impossible. The countries also differ in terms of digital infrastructure and government enough to warrant divergent approaches to implementing national digital ID.\n\nThe Philippines decided on a goal of registering 90 percent of its eligible population before advancing to service delivery. Biometric Ecosystem Head Sanjith Sundaram notes that the Philippines began by floating separate requests for proposals for devices and an integrator to help set up the system. The RFP for biometric enrollment kits was won by <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/thales-digital-identity-and-security\">Thales</a>, which supplied around 7,800 kits.\n\nThe country reached 78 million registrations earlier this year. \u201cThat\u2019s why you see Philippines becoming very active with use cases now,\u201d Santhanam observes.\n\nMorocco also focused initially on registration, but began launching services with its national ID when it reached 10 million enrolled, with <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/idemia\">Idemia</a> as its biometric solutions provider. The country\u2019s digital ID has since been implemented for myriad uses, including in its <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202304/morocco-bringing-some-courts-online-with-national-digital-id\">court system</a>, and is being integrated for delivery of <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/morocco-will-introduce-digital-ids-into-health-services\">health services</a>.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t say which is right, which is wrong, because that depends upon the nation, and it\u2019s the choice of the nation and their strategy for their people,\u201d Santhanam says.\n\nEleven countries are at various stages of adopting <a href=\"https://mosip.io/about.php\">MOSIP</a> to build their national digital ID, and the organization is in talks with several more in Africa and Latin America.", "link": "https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/a-tale-of-two-mosip-implementations-philippines-and-morocco", "date_published": "2023-08-03T18:46:34+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/biometricupdate", "title": "Paravision improves facial recognition accuracy by 30% with Gen 6 suite launch", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://d1sr9z1pdl3mb7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/03140600/face-recognition-scaled.jpg\" width=\"2048\" />\n\t\t<a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/paravision\">Paravision</a> has launched its sixth-generation facial recognition product suite, Paravision Gen 6.

In Singapore, a similar system is already in place, and performing well enough that legislators are considering eliminating passport checks.\n\nThe Montego Bay Jamaica (MBJ) Airports Limited Chief Executive Officer Shane Munroe made the announcement recently, saying the novelty is intended to facilitate boarding and bag-drop processes for passengers travelling through the SIA as well as enhance checkpoint security, Jamaica Gleaner <a href=\"https://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20230802/sia-biometrics-installed-next-tourism-season\">reports</a>.\n\nWith the system, passengers will be able to check in from their mobile devices before proceeding to biometric kiosks installed at different counters in the airport for identity verification.\n\n\u201cBiometrics is going to be a new frontier for us this year,\u201d said Monroe, who also explained that the self-bag drop system will enable passengers move through the various check processes faster.\n\nThe project also includes the introduction of boarding gates. \u201cPassengers will be able to board their flight with biometrics, and that\u2019s something that\u2019s very cutting-edge. It\u2019s really a pilot project, not yet implemented in many airports globally,\u201d the official said.\n\nApart from the technology, a major infrastructure plan to facilitate movements in and out of the airport has also been unveiled.\n\nJamaica has been <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/201912/veriscan-biometrics-surpass-1m-air-passengers-processed-as-japan-jamaica-sweden-add-checks\">planning the deployment</a> of face biometrics at SIA since before the pandemic.\n\nMeanwhile, lawmakers in Singapore are examining proposed changes to the country\u2019s Immigration Act which will make checkpoint biometric screening possible even without passports. The Ministry of Home Affairs has proposed the changes, which would allow it to share information with the airport operator for specific uses.\n\nAccording to <a href=\"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/passports-biometric-clearance-checkpoints-airport-immigration-act-ica-3668346\">Channel News</a>, the amendments will introduce many other changes aimed at better controlling Singaporean borders and enhance the management of passes and permits for visitors and permanent residents.\n\nAs part of the proposal, permits and passes will be accepted in digital format to check immigration status, unlike now that only physical copies are accepted.\n\nSingapore\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202205/biometric-air-travel-initiatives-advance-in-singapore-us-south-africa-uk-brazil\">Changi Airport</a> uses iris biometrics in addition to face.", "link": "https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/face-biometrics-planned-for-jamaica-airport-may-replace-passport-checks-in-singapore", "date_published": "2023-08-03T17:11:38+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/biometricupdate", "title": "World ID \u2013 Changing the world or sci-fi dystopia?", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://d1sr9z1pdl3mb7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/26142534/sam-altman-worldcoin-orb.jpg\" width=\"2048\" />\n\t\t<em>By Alan Goode, CEO and Chief Analyst at <a href=\"https://www.goodeintelligence.com/\">Goode Intelligence</a></em>\n\nWould you let a shiny metal orb scan your iris for Crypto and a T-shirt printed with \u201cunique human\u201d written on it? Well, over two million people around the world have signed up to <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/worldcoin\">Worldcoin</a> (WLD), an iris biometric cryptocurrency project developed by San Francisco and Berlin-based Tools for Humanity and co-founded by Sam Altman, founder of OpenAI and creator of ChatGPT.\n\nThe crypto-focused project aims are to create a\u00a0global unique digital identity (World ID), a global currency (Worldcoin token, WLD) and an app (Word App) that enables payment,\u00a0purchases and transfers using its token. Central to these three components is the Orb, an iris-scanning device that verifies proof-of-personhood (PoP).\n\nWorld ID is an open and permissionless identity protocol that can be used anonymously to prove uniqueness and humanness.\n\nIf Altman wanted to generate a ton of noise surrounding Worldcoin, he has certainly achieved his ambition. Not all of the noise is positive though, with questions over the actual use of the Worldcoin token and privacy concerns raised by a number of data protection and <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/multiple-regulators-turn-gaze-to-worldcoins-iris-collection\">privacy regulators</a> including France\u2019s CNIL and the UK\u2019s ICO.\n\nThere is so much to unpack in this story and a lot has been already said about the merits of the project and the reaction from the world\u2019s regulators. I will concentrate this article on my thoughts on the World ID \u2018Technical Implementation\u2019 <a href=\"https://whitepaper.worldcoin.org/technical-implementation\">white paper</a>, including how the biometric components operate.\n<h2>How does World ID work?</h2>\nThe first step for someone wanting to get a World ID is to download the World App, a mobile wallet designed to bring digital ID and global finance to all. When the World App works in verified mode, the Orb is used to verify proof-of-personhood (PoP).\n\nEnrolments starts with the user creating a Semaphore keypair on their smartphone, referred to as the World ID keypair. The Orb associates the public key with a user\u2019s iris code, whose current sole purpose is to be used in the uniqueness check.\n\nProof-of-personhood answers the question, \u201care you human and unique?\u201d It doesn\u2019t answer the question of \u201cwho are you?\u201d (identity verification), or \u201care you who you say you are?\u201d (authentication). For the purposes of this project, World ID\u2019s creators believe that this is an adequate level of verification.\n\nThe Orb is used to verify World ID users based on proof-of-personhood principles. The Orb is a custom device that has taken three years to develop by an in-house team at Tools for Humanity. The decision to engineer a device in-house was taken because the team believed that off-the-shelf technology, including smartphones, were insufficient for their requirements. The white paper states that \u201csmartphone cameras are insufficient for iris biometrics due to their low resolution across the iris, which decreases accuracy.\u201d\n\nIris is a good choice for World ID as if you are looking for a biometric modality that can scale to billions of users with a very low false match rate, then iris is currently the best choice. The UK\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) <a href=\"https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/biometrics/iris\">states</a> that \u201cIris recognition is considered to have a very low\u00a0<em>false match rate</em>\u00a0and is often selected to be used where population sizes are large.\u201d\u00a0As Worldcoin has lofty aspirations of reaching billions of people globally, then the product and engineering teams have chosen an excellent modality.\n\nThe white paper goes into great lengths to detail the design and operation of the Orb. The Orb\u2019s iris system uses multi-angle and multi-spectrum cameras to create a high-quality image and to prevent spoof attacks. All iris codes captured by the Orb are signed by a secure element to ensure they have been collected by an authorized device. The device is powered by an Nvidia Jetson Xavier NX that enables running several AI algorithms at the edge in real time that can distinguish spoofing attempts from genuine humans based on the input from those sensors locally.\n\nAccording to the white paper, \u201cno images are stored unless users give explicit consent to help improve the system for everyone.\u201d I am assuming this refers to training reasons, but it does seem to blow a hole in the privacy claims if iris images are being stored. As the Orb is being used around the world in areas where literacy may be low, I am not too sure if whether a World ID user will be qualified enough to make an educated decision on whether to permit their iris image to be stored or not. Several data protection and privacy regulators have expressed concern on this process and have started to enquire about the detail of biometric data and storage. CNIL, the French data protection authority, said in response to a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/frances-privacy-watchdog-says-worldcoin-legality-seems-questionable-2023-07-28/\">Reuters question</a> on Worldcoin \"The legality of this collection seems questionable, as do the conditions for storing biometric data.\"\n\nThe enrolment process for generating a World ID and verifying at an Orb is described in the white paper and is as follows:\n<ol>\n \t<li>Person downloads the World App and generates a World ID keypair</li>\n \t<li>Person visits an Orb and verifies their account by generating a QR code on the World App and presenting it to the Orb</li>\n \t<li>Orb checks person is human, alive and non-fraudulent, and captures both irises</li>\n \t<li>The Orb takes the iris images and converts them (hash function) into the iris code</li>\n \t<li>Orb computes iris code locally and signs it using the Orb\u2019s secure element</li>\n \t<li>Images from the sign up are destroyed \u201cunless explicitly approved by the user for training purposes\u201d</li>\n \t<li>World App randomly generates secret key, and from it the identity commitment</li>\n \t<li>Key is stored locally</li>\n \t<li>Checks the iris code is far enough from all previous ones (based on the Hamming distance calculation), and Orb signature</li>\n \t<li>Stores the new iris code on Blockchain</li>\n \t<li>The contract is created by inserting the new identity commitment into the Merkle tree</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Thoughts and conclusion</h2>\nFor World ID, the use of iris biometrics in a strikingly designed metal orb is statement of intent for its backers. One that has certainly attracted a lot of attention, even though some of it not so positive. It is a supremely ambitious project, one that has had many critics. I recently posted a question to my LinkedIn network \u201cIs the\u00a0Orb\u00a0an expensive gimmick or is it the most viable solution for ensuring that a person is unique when onboarding for World ID?\u201d I received a lot of comments with most of the respondents saying that it was a gimmick. It is definitely dividing opinion and is very similar to the polarization of opinion that we are seeing for Cryptocurrency, SSI and a number of other blockchain-based initiatives. There is also a threat that, despite publicly advocating privacy preserving design and Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) principles, It falls into the trap of portraying biometrics as part of a wider surveillance dystopia. The device itself looks like it fell out of a William Gibson book.\n\nI also believe that a problem for Tools for Humanity is that they have developed a very heavily engineered solution to solve one part of the identity conundrum; are you a unique human? From what I take from the white paper, they haven\u2019t solved the \u2018what human are you?\u2019 question. I understand that this may go against some of the foundational pillars for decentralized identity and the coin community but if you want a world identity that can be used for voting, for setting up a bank account or for receiving universal basic income (UBI) then I believe you need to know what person is bound to that identity.\n\nYou would also expect an ambitious global project of this sort to be managed by an established world authority such as the World Bank or the United Nations, not by a group of tech entrepreneurs.\n\nI do think that there are positives that can be taken from the project. The project does chime with a number of important trends that I am seeing in the biometric industry that include the importance of biometrics to digital identity and to the growth of stand-alone biometric devices supporting a wide range of applications including travel, hospitality, sports and entertainment, and retail. I believe that this is a positive step as it pushes biometrics into mainstream press and biometric vendors and suppliers could positively ride on the back of this noise.\n\nI am sure this story will run and run and I shall definitely be following how the project proceeds as part of my continued research into biometrics and digital identity.\n<h2>About the author</h2>\nAlan Goode is CEO and Chief Analyst at <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/goode-intelligence\">Goode Intelligence</a>.", "link": "https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/world-id-changing-the-world-or-sci-fi-dystopia", "date_published": "2023-08-03T16:33:43+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/biometricupdate", "title": "Bermuda adds live facial recognition to CCTV network", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"1363\" src=\"https://d1sr9z1pdl3mb7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/02150303/cctv-command-center-scaled.jpg\" width=\"2048\" />\n\t\tBermuda is planning a $4 million project to upgrade its CCTV network, equipping it with facial and license-plate recognition algorithms.\n\nThe country is planning to install 265 cameras within the next six months as part of the project\u2019s first phase.
