<p>In Google Docs and Sheets, you can make your documents and spreadsheets more interactive by adding <em>smart chips</em> to them. These are highlighted portions of text; when you move the pointer over one of them, a small card that contains more information pops open.</p><p>For example, a smart chip containing a co-worker’s name opens a card with their contact info, or a smart chip with the name of a business opens a card showing its map location. Other types of smart chips include dates, links to related files or meetings, and interactive dropdowns.</p><p>Smart chips are mainly meant to be used on documents or spreadsheets that you’re sharing with others — such as a project document you’re collaborating on with co-workers. The chips help provide extra information to other people viewing and interacting with your document or spreadsheet. Your collaborators can update existing smart chips and add new ones.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3703051/how-to-use-smart-chips-in-google-docs-and-sheets.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
