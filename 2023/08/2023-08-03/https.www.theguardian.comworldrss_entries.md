<p>Former president scheduled to surrender to federal authorities in Washington and enter not guilty plea. Plus, inside the wellness-to-fascism pipeline</p><p>Good morning.</p><p>Donald Trump is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/03/trump-court-indictment-jack-smith-jan-6">scheduled to surrender to federal authorities</a> in Washington this afternoon and enter a not guilty plea to charges that he conspired to defraud the US among other crimes in seeking to subvert the results of the 2020 presidential election.</p><p><strong>Can Trump still run in 2024 after his indictment? </strong>The US constitution does not bar those convicted of a crime from running for president. There could be a pathway to blocking him, however, through the constitution’s 14th amendment. That provision says someone cannot hold office if they have taken an oath to the US, as Trump did when he was inaugurated, and engage in “insurrection or rebellion” against the country.</p><p><strong>What happens if Trump wins the election next November? </strong>If Trump takes office while the charges are still pending against him, he is likely to move to quickly get rid of the charges. He would almost certainly appoint an attorney general who would fire the special counsel Jack Smith. If he has already been convicted, Trump could theoretically pardon himself, an untested legal idea.</p><p><strong>What has Mexico said about the barrier?</strong> Mexico has sent two diplomatic letters to the US saying the barrier violates a water treaty and may encroach on Mexican territory, according to a statement from Mexican authorities published last week. The Mexican foreign ministry said: “We are concerned about the impact on migrants’ human rights and personal security that these state policies could have, as they go in the opposite direction to close collaboration.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/03/first-thing-trump-appear-court-charges-overturn-2020-election">Continue reading...</a>
