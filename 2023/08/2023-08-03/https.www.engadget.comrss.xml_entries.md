<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/brave-browser-search-engine-default-160039239.html">Brave's search engine</a> no longer requires that you jump to Bing or Google just to find photos or videos. The company has <a href="https://brave.com/image-video-search/">introduced</a> image and video queries to Brave Search, helping you find media while maintaining the same levels of privacy and freedom of access. You won't have to worry about being profiled through your picture hunts, or risk missing politically sensitive content (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-bing-blocks-tiananmen-square-searches-212952606.html">if unintentionally</a>) pulled from another engine's index.</p><p>You'll still have the option of continuing searches through competitors, at least for a while. Brave notes that some search features, such as filtering by aspect ratio or license, aren't ready yet. The choice helps you get the results you're looking for, so long as you don't mind using a major engine. It's more important to have a &quot;clear alternative&quot; than absolute feature equality, Brave argues.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Brave image search" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/beec0e90-3239-11ee-9ff4-dc9d32e9e764" style="height: 861px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Brave</div></figure><p>Anyone can use Brave's search engine in the web, although it's set as the default in the company's browser. The firm hopes to expand its reach by asking users to contribute to an anoynmous Web Discovrey Project.</p><p>The relative newcomer launched its homegrown search in 2021, but has stood out from similarly privacy-oriented challengers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/duckduckgos-privacy-focused-browser-is-now-available-for-windows-120039393.html">like DuckDuckGo</a> by trying to avoid the use of third-party indexes. Brave stopped using Bing's search index in May. That cut seven percent of results, but also gave Brave more control over its results.</p><p>This won't necessarily lead to a surge in market share. Brave doesn't even register in StatCtounter's browser market share <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share">statistics</a> — it's not in a position to upset heavyweights like Chrome, Edge and Safari. However, this does eliminate a major objection if you're an enthusiast determined to minimize data collection at much as possible.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/braves-privacy-focused-search-engine-can-now-find-images-and-videos-211548516.html?src=rss

## Apple services are making more cash than ever, but revenue shrank for the third quarter in a row

<p>Apple's financials continue to be in an ever-so-slight slump. Just as we saw the last two quarters, the company suffered minor declines in revenue <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MTMwZTJmMC1hMTRmLTRjNWUtYmRhYi1jZDUyYWM3ZDhlNzkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL25ld3Nyb29tLzIwMjMvMDgvYXBwbGUtcmVwb3J0cy10aGlyZC1xdWFydGVyLXJlc3VsdHMvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwMTliZDNlZi01YmRiLTQwMzEtOGE2YS01NmY5ZTNmMTdhZDkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfbnv6IEdjzI9I6kdVePIRkDP-TKRCT82JQAbCqeouId&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2023%2F08%2Fapple-reports-third-quarter-results%2F">in its fiscal Q3 2023</a> — but these are minor blips for a company that is still raking in absurd amounts of money every quarter.&nbsp;</p><p>As has often been the case, revenue that Apple made from its Services segment (things like paid iCloud plans, Apple Music, AppleCare, the App Store and numerous other offerings) hit an all-time high of $21.2 billion. That's the company's second-largest product category behind the iPhone, and it grew eight percent year-over-year. But iPhone, Mac and iPad revenue all declined compared to a year ago, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/strong-iphone-sales-arent-enough-to-offset-a-big-downturn-in-mac-shipments-210358753.html">same as it did last quarter</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In the case of the iPhone, that decline was slight: revenue of $39.7 billion in the quarter was down about two percent compared to a year ago. iPad (down 19.8 percent) and Mac (down 7.3 percent) sales declined more significantly. But given the fact that Apple hasn't refreshed any iPad hardware since last fall, it's not too surprising to see a drop there. Wearables (like the Apple Watch and AirPods) and accessories were another bright spot, as revenues grew a little over two percent, the only product category besides Services to do so.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, revenues of $81.8 billion represented a less than two percent drop year over year, while profits actually increased about two percent to $19.9 billion.&nbsp;</p><p>As usual, Apple is holding a call with CEO Tim Cook at 5PM ET, and there's more to discuss this quarter than usual. Beyond Apple's normal product categories, this is the first earnings since the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-hands-on-a-new-milestone-for-mixed-reality-060943291.html">ambitious and wildly expensive Vision Pro headset</a> was announced, so it's likely investors may want to hear about how that new product is progressing. And there's the ever-present talk of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-is-reportedly-developing-its-own-generative-ai-chatbot-to-rival-chatgpt-174507671.html">potential AI-related projects</a> hanging out in the background, too. We'll be updating this post with any details Cook shares on the call.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apple-services-are-making-more-cash-than-ever-but-revenue-shrank-for-the-third-quarter-in-a-row-205545482.html?src=rss

## Zeebo, a Latin American console from the Wii era, is getting an emulator

<p>An enterprising developer is working on reviving a lost piece of gaming history. A YouTuber using the handle <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Tuxality/videos">Tuxality</a> has posted a video (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/finally-an-emulator-for-the-one-of-the-worst-consoles-ever-made/">via</a><em>GamesRadar</em>) showing early work on an emulator that can play the games from an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2009-03-24-qualcomm-powered-zeebo-console-pulls-circa-1999-games-over-3g.html">obscure rival</a> to the Wii, Xbox 360 and PS3 that only launched in two countries.</p><p>There’s a good chance you’ve forgotten — or never heard of — the Zeebo gaming console. The Qualcomm-backed system (costing around $170 in US dollar conversions) launched in 2009 with a grand plan to target markets like Brazil and Mexico, where imports of its much-better-known rivals were priced out of reach for most people. It had cellular 3G functionality built in and supported around 40 games. Companies including Activision, Capcom, EA, Disney Interactive Studios and id Software lined up to develop software for the upstart system.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Launching the same year as the iPhone App Store, the Zeebo eschewed discs and cartridges, instead earning a footnote in gaming history as the first console that exclusively used digital downloads. Think of it as a precursor to homebound mobile-game consoles like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-22-ouya-kickstarter-console-shut-down-june-25-razer.html">also-defunct Ouya</a>.</p><figure><img alt="Archival marketing image of the Zeebo gaming console.

Although its website teased information about future launches in China and Russia and an upcoming Android-based system, nothing ever materialized. The company was never heard from again. Today, the URL that once served as the system’s online home is now the landing page for a supplements ad.</p><p>As you can see in the video below, Tuxality demonstrates early progress in loading the Zeebo’s operating system and firing up <em>Crash Bandicoot Nitro Kart 3D</em>. The emulation shows numerous graphical hiccups, typical of early emulator builds. However, the fact that a talented software engineer is eyeing the system as a personal project should be welcome news for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-playstation-game-preservation-team-143059442.html">video game preservationists</a>. Even obscure and short-lived projects like the Zeebo played a part in the relatively brief legacy of gaming hardware, and — like any history — its library is better conserved than erased.</p><div id="2d358d8e6bbd4218a5e6aa66799b6b1e"></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/zeebo-a-latin-american-console-from-the-wii-era-is-getting-an-emulator-202555511.html?src=rss

## Why Baldur’s Gate III is an accidental PS5 console exclusive

<p><em>Baldur’s Gate III</em> is available right now — partially. To be clear, the game itself is complete, but its rollout is fragmented, with different release dates for each of its planned platforms. Following a lengthy Early Access period, the PC and Mac version of <em>Baldur’s Gate III</em> went live today, August 3, while the PlayStation 5 version is due out on September 6. The game’s developer, Larian Studios, hasn’t provided a release date for the Xbox Series X and S edition.</p><p>This isn’t a wholly unprecedented situation. After all, plenty of games come out at different times on various platforms, determined by licensing and exclusivity deals, or simply developer priority. In the case of <em>Baludr’s Gate III</em>, though, something went wrong — specifically with the Xbox version.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“We have no exclusivity deal that prevents us from launching on Xbox,” Larian Studios director of publishing Michael Douse said <a href="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/1685821250554245121"><ins>on X in July</ins></a>. “The issue is a technical hurdle. We cannot remove the split-screen feature because we are obliged to launch with feature parity, and so continue to try and make it work.”</p><figure><img alt="Baldur's Gate III" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/8ae832c0-3236-11ee-bfff-e8f7a22c9e35" style="height: 1080px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Larian Studios</div></figure><p>Larian is having trouble fitting <em>Baldur’s Gate III</em> on the Xbox Series S, the lower-priced and lower-powered console in Microsoft’s ninth-generation lineup. Microsoft requires all games to run, feature-complete and without changes in quality or mechanics, on both the Xbox Series X and Series S. With <em>Baldur’s Gate III</em>, this parity rule means the game will be console-exclusive to the PS5 for four months, at least.</p><p>“We have quite a few engineers working very hard to do what no other RPG of this scale has achieved: seamless drop-in, drop-out co-op on Series S,” Douse said <a href="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/1685821620756021249"><ins>on X</ins></a>. “We hope to have an update by the end of the year.”</p><p><em>Baldur’s Gate III</em> is a highly anticipated role-playing game set in the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> universe, offering familiar classes and abilities in an expansive high-fantasy world. The original <em>Baldur’s Gate</em> landed in 1998 to critical and commercial acclaim, and <em>Baldur’s Gate II: Shadows of Amn </em>followed in 2000. The series spawned spin-offs and enhanced editions, but <em>Baldur’s Gate III</em> is the franchise’s first mainline installment in more than 20 years. Reviews for the PC version are already rolling in, and they’re looking good overall.</p><p>PS5 players will get to try out the console version on September 6, but Xbox Series X/S players will have to wait. Though Microsoft’s parity requirements have been in place since the Xbox Series consoles came to market in November 2020, <em>Baldur’s Gate III</em> is the ecosystem’s highest-profile loss directly attributable to these restrictions.</p><figure><img alt="Baldur's Gate III" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/8ad769e0-3236-11ee-b86a-167354654fc3" style="height: 1080px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Larian Studios</div></figure><p>Larian's issue is likely to be related to RAM. While both the Xbox Series X and PS5 have 16GB RAM, the Series S has just 10GB, running at a slower speed than the other consoles, which dramatically lowers its total memory bandwidth. (The Series S’ GPU is also significantly underpowered compared with the PS5 and Series X, but it’s much easier to “turn down the graphics” than to recode your game.) Clearly, there is potential for Microsoft’s parity requirement to limit the availability, scope and quality of games on the Xbox Series X.</p><p>The debate over this potentiality hit a fever pitch last year, with players asking whether the Series S was “holding back” the ninth console generation overall. There weren’t a ton of concrete examples to prove this theory, and the <em>Digital Foundry</em> team <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJS2g3vaAE"><ins>argued against the idea</ins></a>, citing the existing variance in the PC market and saying that lower targets could actually help games run even better on higher-powered consoles. Still, a handful of developers from the indie and AAA space <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/developer-claims-many-studios-are-asking-xbox-to-drop-mandatory-series-s-compatibility/"><ins>went public in late 2022</ins></a> with their frustrations around the parity rule.</p><p>“MANY developers have been sitting in meetings for the past year desperately trying to get Series S launch requirements dropped,” Bossa Studios VFX artist Ian Maclure tweeted at the time. “Studios have been through one development cycle where Series S turned out to be an albatross around the neck of production, and now that games are firmly being developed with new consoles in mind, teams do not want to repeat the process.”</p><p>Rocksteady senior character technical artist Lee Devonald similarly tweeted about his experience building <em>Gotham Knights</em> — a game that shipped on consoles with a framerate locked at 30 fps and no performance mode. According to <a href="https://gamerant.com/rocksteady-fleur-marty-comments-xbox-series-s-holding-back-generation/"><em><ins>Gamerant</ins></em></a>, Devonald said that multiplatform developers had to “optimize for the lowest performer,” and, “we have a current-gen console that’s not much better than a last gen one,” referencing the Xbox Series S.</p><p>&quot;[An] entire generation of games, hamstrung by that potato,&quot; Devonald tweeted.</p><figure><img alt="Baldur's Gate III" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/8af74df0-3236-11ee-bb7e-248c10446ab8" style="height: 1080px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Larian Studios</div></figure><p>With the Xbox Series X/S, Microsoft pivoted away from the traditional console-upgrade cycle and instead focused on establishing its wider gaming ecosystem, which centers cloud play in a post-hardware future. Sony, meanwhile, stuck to tradition — its pitch for the PS5 is more power, faster loading, better graphics and smoother animations than the PS4. This has largely worked out for Sony: It’s leading in console sales, with more than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-has-sold-over-40-million-ps5-consoles-150040065.html"><ins>40 million</ins></a> PS5s in homes around the globe. Xbox said at a Brazilian game festival in June that it has over <a href="https://twitter.com/Welfare_JBP/status/1674533475158835202"><ins>21 million</ins></a> players on Xbox Series X and Series S consoles.</p><p>Regardless of whether the Series S is restraining the <em>entire </em>video game industry, Xbox parity requirements are literally holding back <em>Baldur’s Gate III</em>, and this system has accidentally created another console exclusive for the PS5, for now.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/why-baldurs-gate-iii-is-an-accidental-ps5-console-exclusive-200521291.html?src=rss

## Is decentralization the future of social media?

<p>While the jury is still out on whether Meta’s new Threads will be a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/one-week-in-threads-has-become-twitters-biggest-threat-140050889.html"><ins>Twitter killer</ins></a>, the app could still upend how we think of social networks. Not because of how many users it has, but because of Meta’s promise to integrate ActivityPub, the decentralized protocol that powers Mastodon and other fediverse apps, into Threads.</p><p>Though that functionality hasn’t been built yet, there are hints about it sprinkled throughout the service. For now, the most prominent clue is the “threads.net” URL at the top of each user’s profile. It currently links to a brief message that hints at what’s coming. “Soon, you’ll be able to follow and interact with people on other fediverse platforms, like Mastodon,” it reads.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For close watchers of the fediverse — the collection of decentralized services that run on ActivityPub — those 15 words could be the start of one of the most consequential moments for the technology. While interest in the fediverse has been growing over the last year, it’s still not widely understood, even by some who are active on places like Mastodon. But Meta’s entry into the space could expose a lot more people to the power, and perils, of decentralized social networks.</p><h2>What even is decentralized social media?</h2><p>For enthusiasts, the rise of decentralized platforms represents an opportunity for a more open web — a chance to tear down some of the walled gardens that have become the norm on mainstream social media platforms. “It reminds me of the early, heady days of the Internet, when the web was happening,” Mike McCue, a former Netscape executive and current CEO of Flipboard said. “I believe that this is where the entire social media space will go.”</p><p>Because they are open source and not controlled by a single entity, ActivityPub and other protocols allow users to interact with each other’s content, regardless of where it originated. The concept is often compared to email, which also relies on foundational protocols that most people don’t think much about.</p><p>“I can email somebody with a random .com address from my .edu address and it just works, the servers talk to each other and the email is delivered,” explains Ross Schulman, the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s decentralization fellow. Decentralized social media promises a similar experience, he says. “Instead of exchanging little short messages that we call emails, they exchange little short messages that we call social media, or images or likes, or replies.”</p><p>Right now, this kind of experience is limited to Mastodon and other, more niche services that make up the current fediverse. That’s not starting to change as larger and more mainstream platforms begin to experiment with ActivityPub.</p><p>Tumblr has said it plans <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/21/tumblr-to-add-support-for-activitypub-the-social-protocol-powering-mastodon-and-other-apps/"><ins>to support</ins></a> ActivityPub. Blogging platform Medium started its own Mastodon instance last year, and now offers membership as a premium &quot;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/12/medium-embraces-twitter-alternative-mastodon-with-launch-of-its-own-community/">perk</a>&quot; to paying subscribers. Mozilla has also started its own Mastodon instance, <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozilla-social-mastodon-private-beta-announcement/"><ins>calling it</ins></a> a “long-term investment” in the future of social media. The BBC recently announced the start of a six-month <a href="https://www.bbc.com/rd/blog/2023-07-mastodon-distributed-decentralised-fediverse-activitypub"><ins>experiment</ins></a> with Mastodon. News aggregator Flipboard is even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/flipboard-is-leaning-into-mastodon-and-away-from-twitter-160036103.html"><ins>more invested</ins></a>. The company has started its own Mastodon instance, promised to adopt ActivityPub and added integrations with Bluesky, another decentralized platform that uses its own protocol.</p><h2>Why now?</h2><p>Despite the recent surge in interest, the idea of the fediverse and decentralized, protocol-based social media is far from new. The ActivityPub protocol was officially established in 2018, but the idea of federated platforms is <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/03/introduction-distributed-social-network"><ins>even older</ins></a>.</p><p>“ActivityPub is another instantiation of the basic idea of the internet … every node should be able to talk with any other node at the simplest level,” says Sorin Matei, communications professor and associate dean at Purdue University.</p><p>Though Mastodon gained some notoriety in 2017, much of the fediverse remained relatively obscure — until Elon Musk announced his plan to take over Twitter. The acquisition represented a “tectonic shift” for decentralized social media, Matei tells Engadget. New users began to flood Mastodon in the days immediately after his bid <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-alternative-mastodon-open-source-021001965.html"><ins>was announced</ins></a>, and there have been regular surges that coincide with controversial decisions he’s made since. The service currently has just over 2 million active users, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@Gargron/110758117937490286"><ins>according to</ins></a> founder Eugen Rochko.</p><p>Bluesky, another decentralized platform, has also notched <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jack-dorsey-backed-bluesky-is-having-a-moment-133039184.html">early success</a>. The service, which began as an offshoot of Twitter but severed all ties with the company last year, has racked up hundreds of thousands of users in its closed beta. Unlike Mastodon, the team behind Bluesky is developing its own federated protocol, the <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/10-18-2022-the-at-protocol"><ins>AT Protocol</ins></a>. For now, the only instance of Bluesky is the closed beta, but the company has said it plans to start <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/5-5-2023-federation-architecture"><ins>testing</ins></a> federation.</p><p>And while the AT Protocol and ActivityPub are separate standards, the visions behind them are similar. Already, there are projects <a href="https://skybridge.fly.dev/"><ins>to “bridge”</ins></a> the two, and some fediverse enthusiasts suspect the distinction between the two will matter less as both Mastodon and Bluesky mature. “The most important thing is the first principles built around both these protocols are identical,” McCue told Engadget. “The most important thing is there's an open protocol — actually two — to build the federated social web.”</p><p>For now, the number of people using the federated social web, though, is still small compared with more established platforms. Yet smaller and mid-size companies are investing in the protocols and the platforms they power because they see the surging interest as an opportunity to bolster their own communities. “They think it will actually create a better experience for their users,” Schulman told Engadget. “Whether that’s the promise of an even larger reader pool or access to more people to follow.”</p><p>Meta, which already operates some of the most dominant social networks, may have different motivations. While Zuckerberg has championed “interoperability” in the past, Meta hasn’t historically been welcoming to potential competing networks. Yet the company has talked glowingly about the promise of the fediverse. “Our vision is that people using compatible apps will be able to follow and interact with people on Threads without having a Threads account, and vice versa, ushering in a new era of diverse and interconnected networks,” the company wrote in a blog post <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/07/introducing-threads-new-app-text-sharing/"><ins>announcing</ins></a> Threads.</p><p>Schulman notes that Meta may have more self-serving motivations. “They're trying to portray themselves as not anti-competitive,” Schulman said, pointing to recent regulatory scrutiny.</p><p>It’s still unclear how long it will take Meta to actually add ActivitySupport for Threads. Instagram’s top exec has cautioned it will take time. In addition to technical complications involved, there are also serious moderation issues associated with the fediverse, where communities are responsible for setting their own rules and norms. Researchers have recently flagged the prevalence <a href="https://www.engadget.com/discord-bans-teen-dating-servers-and-the-sharing-of-ai-generated-csam-071626058.html"><ins>of CSAM</ins></a> on some servers. Bluesky, which does currently have centralized moderation, has also dealt with some <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/07/31/inside-bluesky-moderation-crisis-investor-pushback-user-backlash-ceo-apology/"><ins>controversies</ins></a> surrounding its handling of trust and safety. Meta will need to ensure that Threads, which has the same content policies as Instagram, is interoperable with the fediverse while keeping out content that doesn’t align with its rules.</p><p>The stricter approach may also explain why some fediverse backers were not excited about the prospect of Meta joining their ranks, even tangentially. Some Mastodon servers have pledged <a href="https://fedipact.veganism.social/"><ins>to block</ins></a> Threads in order to wall off their users from the Facebook owner. Mastodon’s Rochko alluded to the discontent in a blog post after Threads’ launch, assuring users that Meta won’t be able to serve ads or access the data of Mastodon users. But he made clear he was broadly supportive of Meta’s efforts.</p><p>“We have been advocating for interoperability between platforms for years,” <a href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2023/07/what-to-know-about-threads/"><ins>he wrote</ins></a> shortly. “The biggest hurdle to users switching platforms when those platforms become exploitative is the lock-in of the social graph, the fact that switching platforms means abandoning everyone you know and who knows you. The fact that large platforms are adopting ActivityPub is not only validation of the movement towards decentralized social media, but a path forward for people locked into these platforms to switch to better providers. Which in turn, puts pressure on such platforms to provide better, less exploitative services. This is a clear victory for our cause, hopefully one of many to come.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/is-decentralization-the-future-of-social-media-194554192.html?src=rss

## Researchers reveal Tesla jailbreak that could unlock Full Self-Driving for free

<p>Researchers say they have found a hardware exploit with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/tesla/"><ins>Tesla’s</ins></a> infotainment system that could unlock paid upgrades for free, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-offers-customers-one-time-full-self-driving-transfer-until-september-30th-150004266.html"><ins>Full Self-Driving</ins></a> (FSD) and heated rear seats. They used a technique called voltage glitching, which involves tinkering with the supply voltage of the infotainment system's processor.</p><p>“If we do it at the right moment, we can trick the CPU into doing something else,” Christian Werling told <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/03/researchers-jailbreak-a-tesla-to-get-free-in-car-feature-upgrades/"><em><ins>TechCrunch</ins></em></a>. “It has a hiccup, skips an instruction and accepts our manipulated code. That’s basically what we do in a nutshell.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Werling is one of three doctoral students at the Technical University of Berlin who <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/tesla-jailbreak-unlocks-theft-in-car-paid-features">found the exploit</a> with the help of an independent researcher. The team will <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-23/briefings/schedule/index.html#jailbreaking-an-electric-vehicle-in--or-what-it-means-to-hotwire-teslas-x-based-seat-heater-33049">present its work</a> at the Black Hat cybersecurity conference next week.</p><p>Since it’s a hardware exploit, the process requires physical access to a Tesla vehicle. The jailbreak could enable FSD and certain other features, including in regions where Tesla has not yet made them available, the researchers claim. However, they noted that more work would be needed to test those possibilities.</p><p>Still, the researchers claim to have obtained the encryption key that authenticates the car over Tesla’s network, which could lead to them being able to unlock more features. They noted that they were able to obtain personal information from the test car too, including its recent GPS locations, contacts, call logs and calendar appointments.</p><p>For several years, hackers have been attempting to unlock paywalled Tesla features, and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3mb3w/people-are-jailbreaking-used-teslas-to-get-the-features-they-expect"><ins>some efforts have been successful</ins></a>. More recently, one <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/20/23767041/tesla-hacker-elon-mode-hands-free-full-self-driving-autopilot"><ins>discovered</ins></a> a so-called &quot;Elon Mode&quot; for hands-free FSD operations. Tesla has been playing a game of cat and mouse with these hackers for years.</p><p>However, it would be much more difficult for Tesla to revoke this exploit, according to the researchers, given that it’s a hardware-based approach. They claim the company would need physical access to the car. Tesla does not have a communications department that can be reached for comment.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/researchers-reveal-tesla-jailbreak-that-could-unlock-full-self-driving-for-free-190431645.html?src=rss

<p>Nothing has only been around a few years, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nothing-phone-2-review-an-offbeat-alternative-to-boring-midrange-phones-specs-price-160002218.html"><ins>racking up successes in that time frame,</ins></a> and now the company is launching a sub-brand dedicated to affordability. Speaking during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgK0vCHZAIk&amp;t=526s"><ins>company’s latest community update video,</ins></a> CEO Carl Pei announced CMF by Nothing, which promises “a new range of products that make better design more accessible” via low pricing.</p><p>CMF stands for “Color, Material and Finish” and already has a couple of products in the works, including a smartwatch and a pair of earbuds. Both items are set to arrive later this year, with actual details promised for the coming months. Pei says that CMF will set itself apart from its parent brand by focusing on “clean design” that’s “accessible,” whereas Nothing prioritizes a “premium” feel and “design innovation.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="4da67a41fee045378cc5cc430579c91a"></div><p>Pei also noted that CMF is being run by a different team, so it won’t take too much attention from the primary brand’s line of smartphones, earbuds and thingamajigs. This is not the CEO’s first rodeo in the world of affordable sub-brands. Back when <a href="https://www.engadget.com/carl-pei-leaving-oneplus-235552807.html"><ins>he was with OnePlus,</ins></a> Pei kickstarted the Nord sub-brand, which is still around and regularly releases budget-friendly smartphones, earbuds and smartwatches.</p><p>It’s worth noting that Nothing already wades in the waters of affordability. The Nothing Phone 2 is $600, which is much lower than rival flagship offerings, and the Ear 1 earbuds originally launched for $100, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nothing-ear-1-earbuds-price-increase-120043121.html"><ins>before the price raised to $150</ins></a> due to increased material costs.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/nothing-announces-budget-friendly-sub-brand-readies-new-smartwatch-183712114.html?src=rss

## Patreon is fixing canceled payments and inaccessible funds for creators

<p>Patreon said today it has fixed the root cause of a problem that led to creators and patrons seeing widespread rejected payments this week, and it’s still working to solve the larger problem. The funding platform confirmed to Engadget that financial institutions have flagged “a slightly higher-than-normal number of patron payments” as fraudulent. In addition, some creators said they’re unable to access their funds, which Patreon describes as an unrelated problem stemming from a partner update.</p><p>The company describes the inability to access payouts as only affecting “creators using a single payment partner,” which its <a href="https://status.patreon.com/">system status page</a> identifies as Payoneer. It says it’s working “actively with Payoneer to restore payouts” and expects to see the transactions restored today.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The problem gained attention after various Patreon users posted on social channels about losing supporters en masse. Many reported that Patreon’s billing information appeared to have recently shifted to Dublin, which some users speculated was the root cause of banks flagging the transactions as fraudulent. “I just checked and have lost 80% of my patrons,” Dr. Brooke Magnanti, author of Secret Diary of a London Call Girl, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/belledejour.bsky.social/post/3k42jgda6rx2n">posted</a> on Bluesky today. “Awesome.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Reddit user u/Competitive_Fruit901 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/patreon/comments/15g4sj8/why_did_i_suddenly_lost_300_patrons/">wrote</a> on Wednesday that they lost 300 patrons. “Billing messed up way more than usual this month,” u/Koratl replied. “A lot of people’s cards flagged Patreon as fraudulent.” Redditor u/arzen 353 chimed in, “Not only that, there’s no way to re-try payment once you authorize it with your bank. People can’t re-subscribe even if they want to. Apparently you just have to wait for patreon to un-fuck itself.”</p><div id="13e76d5df4484536be626ef3e79ae578"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Hey, if you're a Patreon creator and are confused as to why a bunch of your income vanished, it's because Patreon's system appears to have totally collapsed. They sent me an email saying my credit card blocked the payment as fraudulent, and CANCELLED ALL OF MY CREATOR SUPPORT. 1/</p>— Jason Pargin, author of John Dies at the End, etc (@JasonKPargin) <a href="https://twitter.com/JasonKPargin/status/1686783605551382530?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 2, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>Patreon tells Engadget that the Dublin billing location is likely related to a recent upgrade. “We made a required upgrade with one of our payment processing partners,” company spokesperson Ellen Satterwhite wrote in an email response. “That may have changed the descriptors people are used to seeing in their statements. We are working closely with this payment processing partner to resolve the issue.” Patreon doesn’t expect the flagged payments to be a long-term issue. “As a matter of course, when payment declines happen for various reasons, and payments are retried, those patron relationships are restored,” the company told Engadget. The company added that it didn’t want to speculate about a timeline or specific actions until it’s fully rolled out a fix.</p><p>At least one user reported getting things back on track after calling their financial institution. u/Current-Confusion-67 described a lengthy ordeal of calling the card provider, verifying information and finally seeing their Patreon setup return to normal. “I don’t really know what’s going on myself, and I can’t really seem to track down an answer to why these things are happening, but I’d say the issues are probably related to the location of payments being processed suddenly changing to another country entirely causing cards to be flagged by fraud prevention.”</p><p>We’ll update this article as we receive more information.

## FCC issues record $300 million fine for auto warranty robocallers

<p>After a months-long investigation, the FCC has decided to go ahead with its proposed <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-imposes-record-fine-transnational-illegal-robocalling-operation"><ins>record-setting $300 million fine</ins></a> against “the largest illegal robocall operation” the agency has ever encountered. This is the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/robocall-company-may-receive-the-largest-fine-ever-from-the-fcc-110759522.html"><ins>heftiest fine ever issued by the FCC,</ins></a> due to the massive scope and illegality of the robocalling operation.</p><p>The agency issued the fine to an “international network of companies” that executed a scheme to make more than five billion robocalls to 500 million phone numbers during a three-month span in 2021. There are only 330 million people in the USA, so it’s likely you received one or many of these auto warranty scam calls. Additionally, the FCC concluded that the criminal enterprise violated federal spoofing laws by using more than a million different caller ID numbers to trick victims into answering the phone. In related news, answering the phone sucks.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The list of violations keep coming. The operation, run by Roy Cox, Jr. and Michael Aaron Jones via their Sumco Panama company, skirted prohibitions by sending pre-recorded voice calls to mobile phones without consent, placing telemarketing calls without consent and even dialing numbers included on the National Do Not Call Registry. The nefarious group also failed to identify callers at the start of conversations and voice messages and refused to provide call-back numbers to allow consumers to opt out of future communications. They basically turned 500 million smartphones into scam machines.</p><p>The FCC originally proposed the monumental fine because the robocalling met the criteria for “egregious violations” of current laws. Consumers have described the calls as “incessant” and “harassment.” To that end, Sumco Panama even participated in practices like calling health care workers from spoofed hospital numbers. It also changed its name when needed, to keep the subterfuge going, using company monikers like Virtual Telecom, Davis Telecom, Geist Telecom, Tech Direct, Posting Express and many more.&nbsp;</p><p>As previously mentioned, the enterprise had been selling fake auto warranties since 2018. In addition to the fine, Cox and Jones were issued lifetime bans against making telemarketing calls. Last year, the FCC directed all United States voice service providers to cease carrying traffic associated with the pair and its entities. The agency gave the parties a chance to defend themselves, but they haven’t responded. If they don’t pay the gigantic fine in a timely fashion, the whole matter will be referred to the U.S. Department of Justice.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/fcc-issues-record-300-million-fine-for-auto-warranty-robocallers-171431348.html?src=rss

## Google is making it easier to remove your private information from Search

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google/">Google</a> has announced several updates to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google-search/">Search</a> aimed at making it easier for people to control information about them that appears in results. The company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-remove-phone-number-address-from-search-183823387.html">released a tool</a> last year to help people take down search results containing their phone number, home address or email. Now, the company has updated the &quot;results about you&quot; tool to make it more effective.</p><p>A new dashboard will become available in the coming days that will let you know when such personal information pops up in Search. When you get an alert, you'll swiftly be able to ask Google to remove those results.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Earlier this year, the company debuted a Google One feature that can <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-ones-vpn-will-soon-be-available-to-all-subscribers-170006417.html">scour the dark web</a> to see if your information has been included in a data breach. This &quot;results about you&quot; update seems to work in a similar way. The fact that it proactively finds results containing your personal info and helps you remove them should make it easier to protect your privacy.</p><figure><img alt="Screenshots showing how to request the removal of personal information from Google Search.

It's available in the US in English for now, but Google plans to offer the tool in other languages and regions soon.</p><p>Along similar lines, Google is updating a system that aids users in taking down explicit photos of them. The company has long provided the option for people to request the removal of non-consensual explicit images from search results. It's now expanding that policy to include consensual imagery.</p><p>Perhaps you uploaded explicit content of yourself to a website at one point, but decide you no longer want it to be available. If you delete the imagery from that website, you can now ask Google to remove it from search results if it has been published elsewhere without permission. The company notes that the policy doesn't apply to any content you're still commercializing.&nbsp;</p><p>It's not exactly rare for owners of websites that deal in explicit imagery to report content from elsewhere. Removing such content from Google Search results won't scrub it from the web entirely, but that may make it more difficult for people to find. You can search for &quot;request removals&quot; in the Google help center to get started.</p><figure><img alt="Screenshots showing the SafeSearch blur setting in Google Search.

## Instagram fights DM spam with limits on text and photos

<p>Instagram is making it difficult to flood your DM inbox. The social network is rolling out stricter DM request policies that, among other things, limits senders to a single message if you don't follow them. You'll have to accept the chat request before they can send anything more. DM requests are now limited to text, too. Creeps and spammers can't send photos, videos or voice messages, in other words.</p><p>The company started testing the new DM restrictions in late June. The company already has some tools to combat spam, including a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagrams-latest-feature-lets-you-limit-comments-and-requests-on-popular-posts-060438889.html">&quot;Hidden Words&quot; tool</a> that hides messages with objectionable keywords and emoji. There are now filters for scams and spam. You can also safeguard against surges in DM requests, although that won't stop the occasional spammer from getting through.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Instagram characterizes the move as a safety measure, particularly for women. The firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/03/instagrams-new-feature-protects-users-from-unwanted-images-and-videos-in-dms/?guccounter=1">explains</a> to <em>TechCrunch</em> that women frequently receive unsolicited nudes in their DMs. This effectively halts the practice, although it won't stop harassers from sending crude text.</p><p>The addition comes as parent company Meta is facing pressure from politicians and critics to improve its anti-abuse measures, particularly for teens. A Senate bill would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bipartisan-senate-bill-would-require-parental-consent-for-teens-to-use-social-media-172601557.html">require parental consent</a> for teens wanting to use social media apps, for instance, while Arkansas recently enacted a law <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arkansas-passes-social-media-law-requiring-age-verification-230716388.html">requiring age verification</a>. That's on top of longstanding concerns that its anti-harassment policies <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-elevate-black-voices-harassment-verification-201238553.html">haven't always done enough</a> to protect some demographics. Efforts like this theoretically head off some of the complaints that Meta is letting abuse through.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/instagram-fights-dm-spam-with-limits-on-text-and-photos-165013992.html?src=rss

The discount applies to all four colorways, instead of just one or two.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>While the M2 chip is currently Apple's latest processor, it’s worth noting that new M3-equipped Macs will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-first-m3-macs-could-arrive-in-october-163204526.html">probably debut</a> this fall, along with the<a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-15-pro-set-to-feature-a-thinner-bezel-titanium-frame-and-usb-c-charging-094118389.html"> expected iPhone 15</a>, both of which we anticipate hearing about in September. As the company has done in the past, Apple will likely keep the M2 machines in its lineup, though the price may come down even further.

The quad speakers can fill a room without distortion and the three-mic array does a good job of clearly picking up your voice on calls.

And the battery lasted for 16 and a half hours in our rundown tests.

## The Ayaneo 2S is the company's best gaming handheld, until the next one

<p>We only just reviewed the ROG Ally, and it’s already been dethroned as the “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-ally-hands-on-possibly-the-most-powerful-handheld-gaming-pc-yet-140054506.html">most powerful handheld gaming PC yet</a>.” Or at least, it’s going to have to scoot over a little and let the Ayaneo 2S squeeze in. The two portable PCs have a lot in common: They both have 7-inch displays, they both run Windows 11, they both sport Zen 4-based AMD APUs and they both want to draw your attention away from the cheaper, older, bigger, but fan-favorite Steam Deck.</p><p>The Ayaneo 2S does best the ROG Ally in a few important areas though. The displays might be the same size, but the 2S has a 1200p resolution (ASUS’s is 1080p), the 2S has a larger battery (50Wh vs 40) and the Ally is only available with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. The Ayaneo 2S is available in multiple configurations that start where the Ally does and go right up to 64GB RAM and a cavernous 4TB of storage. It’s important to note, though, that even the most affordable Zen 4-based Ayaneo <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ayaneo-2s-full-screen-great-upgrade-7840u-console#/">starts at $999</a> (or $699 if you’re quick enough to bag an early bird) compared to the Ally’s relative affordability (starting at $699).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While Ayaneo competes with the likes of Valve and ASUS on a technical level, in most other ways, the company is more of an upstart in the world of gaming hardware. But one that has earned a dedicated army of fans thanks to its spec-heavy approach to product design.</p><p>The Ayaneo 2S isn’t just the Ayaneo 2 with a new 7840U processor, but that is by far the most important difference. Cosmetically the two are almost identical bar some larger vent holes on the 2S. There’s also a minor tweak to the triggers that stop them making a noise when fully depressed and an improved fingerprint reader. Most of the other upgrades are to do with cooling, including a graphene patch that has been added and the aforementioned airflow design.</p><figure><img alt="Ayaneo 2S handheld gaming PC." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/7e146510-3212-11ee-bf89-fcff0f810533" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Either way, the new, more powerful processor is really what makes the 2S interesting. ASUS entering the handheld space has added credibility to the portable PC gaming space, perhaps creating a stepping stone between the dependability and smoother UI of the Steam Deck and the tech-heavy, but less refined experience of Ayaneo products. So when ASUS announced the ROG Ally, Ayaneo probably didn’t like losing a superlative claim (of being more powerful than Valve’s competition).</p><p>A new processor is only as good as the performance boost it brings, and even that has to be weighed against any extra tax on the battery (which remains the same 50.25Wh capacity as the original Ayaneo 2). The short version is, there are good gains to be had, but if you were considering the 6800U-based Ayaneo, that’s still a capable performer — and now a more affordable one.</p><p>In general the gaming experience on the 2S is superior, as you would hope, to that of the original Ayaneo 2. Broadly speaking, both can handle most games, even demanding AAA titles at very playable frame rates. The difference is more in the power profile/TDP you need to get that enjoyable experience. For example, on the 2S, I was able to get <em>The Witcher 3</em> to run at a steady 60 fps (“Steam Deck” settings at 800p) with an 11W TDP setting. I could even dial it down to 8W and it’d hover between 55 and 60 fps. For the Ayaneo 2, I had to dial it up to around 15W to achieve a steady 60, or 10W for “almost” 60. This represents a modest, but important upgrade in performance — but every game is different.</p><p>With games like <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> or <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, the difference is more pronounced. The Ayaneo 2 was able to serve up around mid-20 fps for both of these games at 15W TDP at 1200p. The 2S was able to crank out closer to 40 peak fps with a minimum over 30 at the same power setting. Dial the 2S up to 22W TDP and you can expect over 60 fps no problem.</p><figure><img alt="Ayaneo 2S handheld gaming PC." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/dac50850-3212-11ee-beee-b3d3b1cb3599" style="height: 1308px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>It’s hard to do several side by side comparisons for all games and different situations, but it’s easy to see that the 7840U presents a significant upgrade in performance at the higher end. Some benchmarks <a href="https://youtu.be/J4-YqKXKoBs?t=372">even suggest</a> that the Ayaneo 2S consistently bests the performance of the ROG ALLY with like for like settings. This could simply be down to differences in drivers for the new chipsets, but as <a href="https://youtu.be/J4-YqKXKoBs?t=83">YouTuber The Phawx points out</a>, modern games often require a lot of VRAM, and APUs like the 7840U lean on system RAM for that, making the higher spec of the Ayaneo a clear advantage.</p><p>If you’re less worried about playing heavyweight games, and prefer indie titles or older/lighter games then the 2S really shines, being able to run things like <em>Hades</em>, <em>Trine</em>, <em>Return of the Obra Dinn</em>, <em>Hotline Miami</em> and so on at full/high quality settings without even flinching. Importantly, you’ll be able to do so at a much lower TDP — even as low as 5W for many of the above titles.</p><p>It’s with these less-demanding titles where the new processor’s efficiency most noticeably translates into extra battery life. With the Ayaneo 2, at lower TDP settings battery life seems to hover a little over the four hour mark (depending on the game being played). With the 2S, it’s possible to break the five hour mark if you’re frugal — of course this also means disabling wireless, lowering the screen brightness and so on, but it’s a marked improvement.</p><p>Sadly, those gains don’t seem to scale up at the high end. Once above 15W I didn’t notice significant gains in battery life. That said, if you’re now able to play a game at 15W that needed 20W of power on an older model, there’s obviously an inherent power saving there, but at like-for-like wattages, these Windows handhelds are still incredibly power hungry.</p><p>Ayaneo has been broadly praised for its hardware and performance since it entered the scene, it’s the software side of things where people seem to have the most complaints. It doesn’t take long with the 2S before you’re reminded that you’re basically holding a desktop. Especially if there’s a launcher between you and the game — as EA/Rockstar/Ubisoft titles tend to have. On the Steam Deck, for example, these are handled slightly better, but on the Ayaneo platform it can be ugly with different windows popping up.</p><p>The Ayaspace launcher itself rarely gets much praise, but I’ve always found it functional and a nicer experience than just launching titles from the desktop. It doesn’t do an amazing job of hiding Windows from you — you’ll regularly find yourself navigating the desktop with the analog sticks or touchscreen. For the most part you can boot up and get into a game quickly, but the specter of Microsoft’s operating system is never far away.</p><figure><img alt="A screenshot of the updated version of Ayaneo's launcher." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/63394890-3213-11ee-bffd-c1ad751d4c63" style="height: 1200px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>The better news is that Ayaneo has just made version 2.0 of its launcher <a href="https://www.ayaneo.com/support/download">available for download</a> and it looks promising. The general user interface seems much slicker and more lightweight which feels much more in tune with what you might expect from a console experience. I was only able to spend a short amount of time with it, but aesthetically it feels like an improvement with more controls and settings closer to hand.</p><p>Perhaps the bigger problem for the 2S, or Ayaneo owners in general, is that… even in the time between starting this review and finishing it the company’s lineup has changed. The <a href="https://ayaneo.com/product/AYANEOAIR1S.html">Ayaneo Air 1S</a>, a more compact 7840-based handheld, has been announced. That’s not to be confused with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ayaneo-air-pro-gaming-handheld-review-180003707.html">Air Pro</a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ayaneo-air-plus-mini-steam-deck-163047036.html">Air Plus</a>. Then there’s the <a href="https://ayaneo.com/product/AYANEO-KUN.html">Ayaneo Kun</a>, a new, new flagship that’s all new, including an 8-inch display and Steam Deck-like touchpads. Not to mention the dizzying amount of different configurations within each of those, meaning Ayaneo probably has more SKUs than all of its competitors put together.</p><p>Predictably, the Ayaneo 2S is a great gaming handheld that outperforms most of its rivals in several key areas. It’ll handle almost any game you throw at it, and likely do so surprisingly well. But there’s still the matter of price. $999+ for a gaming handheld is a huge spend for most people. One of the reasons the Steam Deck has remained so popular despite new, “superior” competition from Ayaneo and ASUS etc. is that it’s relatively affordable.</p><p>Ayaneo looks set to continue to cater for those who are willing to pay for the latest and greatest, but it’s also at risk of alienating those users by making their $1,200 handheld feel last-gen in just seven months. At the moment, the company’s fans appear to enjoy the rapid-fire approach to releases. Just as they’re about to stop salivating over the latest product, another one pops up on the horizon. There is, of course, a question mark over how long Ayaneo can keep this up without alienating its fans, or even over-stretching its own resources. At least, for now, the next APU refresh from AMD isn’t set for another year or so, so perhaps that’s a chance for Ayaneo to catch its breath. <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ayaneo-kun-the-ultra-powerful-8-4-7840u-handheld/coming_soon?utm_campaign=KUN%20Pre-Launch%200723&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=brevo">Or not</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ayaneo-2s-review-160047194.html?src=rss

<p>The number of video streaming services available has increased dramatically over the past few years as everyone, including Apple, Disney and ESPN, decides they want a piece of the pie. The days when Netflix was your only option are long gone now, and while that’s great for all of us itching to discover our next favorite TV show, deciphering the top picks for best streaming service can also be confusing and expensive. You’re now tasked with figuring out which services have the content you want to watch, which fit into your budget, which have the most compelling original series, movies and documentaries, and the best live TV streaming services.</p><p>We at Engadget wanted to make that process easier for you so we’ve compiled a list of the best video streaming services you can subscribe to right now, with our favorite picks spanning across all content types and budgets. Now, should you go out and subscribe to all of the services listed here? Probably not, unless you’re a true cord cutter aching for content. But these are the services that offer the best bang for your buck, regardless of whether you’re a live sports buff, a classic movie lover or a general streaming enthusiast.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Netflix</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Compared to other streaming services, no one offers more high-quality content at a single price than<a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2a170a1e-7e5c-4edd-b5dd-ea6d3bd9416a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Netflix&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyYTE3MGExZS03ZTVjLTRlZGQtYjVkZC1lYTZkM2JkOTQxNmEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV0ZmxpeC5jb20vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwYmU2ZjhmNC0wNzRkLTM5MGYtOTZkNC0xM2U0MGJiZDYzYTIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWAGDti2aePk7qzavHltLkf92GUGI_NLsQpUPZlEO_tf&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.netflix.com%2F&amp;uuid=bICOZCBbf512cZ9v29286"> Netflix</a>. Pick any category you can think of and Netflix probably has something that will fit the bill, including original programming. Plus, new content is released every week and as a worldwide service, Netflix is consistently adding movies and TV shows from around the globe that can change the viewing experience in ways you may not have considered (Are you sure you’re not into K-Dramas, Finnish detective thrillers or British home improvement shows?).</p><p>Netflix is available in almost every country on the planet, and its app or website runs on most of the devices that connect to the internet. Those apps are also some of the most easy-to-use of any service. That doesn’t mean it’s always simple to choose something to watch, but when it comes to swapping profiles or simply picking up where you left off, it doesn’t get better than this. If you’re heading off the grid — or onto a plane — then you can easily download most (but not all) of its content to watch on your iOS or Android device.</p><p>If you somehow don’t have Netflix already (or someone to share a login with) then getting a taste of it is a little more complicated than it used to be. Netflix <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-free-subscription-235409888.html">dropped its free trial period in the US</a> a while ago so it’s important to have all your information in order before going in to create an account.</p><p>The other thing to keep in mind is that maybe if you’ve let your account lapse, the service that exists now is very different from what you would’ve seen two years ago, or five, or ten. Remaining the dominant player in subscription streaming has required adjustments to stay on top with a changing mix of content and plans to choose from.</p><p>In the US, <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/24926">there are three levels of Netflix</a> you can subscribe to. All of them include unlimited access to the same content, work on the same devices and you can cancel or pause them at any time. The Standard with Ads tier costs $7 per month and it's the only option that includes advertisements. The difference between Standard ($15.50 per month) and Premium ($20 per month) comes down to picture quality and the amount of simultaneous streams allowed. <em>— Richard Lawler, Senior News Editor</em></p><h2>Amazon Prime Video&nbsp;</h2><p></p><p>If you think of <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9QcmltZS1WaWRlby9iL3JlZj1hc19saV9zc190bD9pZT1VVEY4Jm5vZGU9MjY3Njg4MjAxMSZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby01Yi0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMGJlNmY4ZjQtMDc0ZC0zOTBmLTk2ZDQtMTNlNDBiYmQ2M2EyIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAfgZxhCu1LAmScG8qxywgiLc8UDdyem-WQW8R2phSK0Y&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPrime-Video%2Fb%2Fref%3Das_li_ss_tl%3Fie%3DUTF8%26node%3D2676882011%26">Amazon’s Prime Video</a> package as a Netflix-lite, or even if you’ve only used it once or twice, then you may be underestimating the options available. The ad-free (other than trailers) subscription service is available as part of Amazon Prime, which you can purchase for either $15 per month, or $139 annually. While the subscription started out as a way to get free shipping on more purchases, Amazon has <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9oZWxwL2N1c3RvbWVyL2Rpc3BsYXkuaHRtbC9yZWY9aHBfbGVmdF92NF9zaWI_aWU9VVRGOCZub2RlSWQ9MjAxOTEwMzYwJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTViLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwYmU2ZjhmNC0wNzRkLTM5MGYtOTZkNC0xM2U0MGJiZDYzYTIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQkDsT16SMYD9MwlxiKXP4jyxrK6y1x7-jixJ41LYbIm&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fhelp%2Fcustomer%2Fdisplay.html%2Fref%3Dhp_left_v4_sib%3Fie%3DUTF8%26nodeId%3D201910360">tacked on benefits</a> that extend across books, music, games and even groceries. If you’d prefer to get Prime Video only, it’s available as a standalone for $9 per month.</p><p>We’ll focus on the video service, which includes a selection of original and catalog content that is a lot like what Netflix and the others offer. In recent years Amazon Prime has increased its original output with award-winning series like <em>The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</em>, as well as highly-regarded genre content like <em>The Boys</em> and <em>The Expanse</em>.</p><p>When it comes to where you can watch Amazon Prime Video, the list of options rivals Netflix. Streaming boxes and smart TVs, whether they’re part of Amazon’s Fire TV platform or not, are almost a given. Game consoles? Check. The only major gap in compatibility was Google’s Chromecast, and it closed that hole in the summer of 2019.</p><p>Amazon also has a significant amount of content that’s available to watch in 4K and HDR and unlike Netflix it won’t charge you extra for the privilege. The same goes for simultaneous streams — <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcmltZXZpZGVvLmNvbS9oZWxwL3JlZj1hdHZfaHBfY250LzEzOS04MDIxMjg2LTUyNjU5MDI_X2VuY29kaW5nPVVURjgmbm9kZUlkPTIwMjA5NTUwMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMGJlNmY4ZjQtMDc0ZC0zOTBmLTk2ZDQtMTNlNDBiYmQ2M2EyIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAfOtBv4CeMKdGKuynKlZeM3fK4Nlw5PuXDKWhwsj0tvh&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.primevideo.com%2Fhelp%2Fref%3Datv_hp_cnt%2F139-8021286-5265902%3F_encoding%3DUTF8%26nodeId%3D202095500">Amazon’s rules</a> say you can have up to two running concurrently. When it comes to downloads, Amazon allows offline viewing on its Fire devices, Android and iOS.</p><p>The only downside is that Amazon’s apps aren’t quite on par with Netflix in terms of usability. While all the features are there, simple things like reading an episode summary, enabling closed-captions or jumping out of one show and into another are frequently more frustrating on Amazon than on other platforms. The company also frequently insists on bringing its Fire TV-style interface to other platforms instead of using their native controls. That can make it harder to use, although on platforms where it hews to the built-in controls, like Roku, can be easier to use.</p><p>One other thing to think about is that Amazon’s video apps link to its on-demand store, and include access to Channels. For cord-cutters who just want a consistent experience across different devices, that means you can easily buy or rent content that isn’t part of the subscription. Amazon Channels lets you manage subscriptions to Britbox, Showtime, Paramount+ and others. <em>— R.L.</em></p><h2>Max</h2><p></p><p>In 2020, HBO decided to take the fight to its streaming competitors with <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5oYm9tYXguY29tLz8_IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwYmU2ZjhmNC0wNzRkLTM5MGYtOTZkNC0xM2U0MGJiZDYzYTIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAd0xiySwI5a6HI_mRS4a-CrfpkLxHutET9uzHwUux2Q6&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hbomax.com%2F%3F%3F">HBO Max</a>. It supplanted the existing HBO channels, as well as streaming via HBO Go or HBO Now by refocusing on original content and rebuilding the service for the modern era. Even before the recent merger and rebranding as simply Max, it had the advantage of linking to one of the deepest (and best) content libraries available, drawing from the premium cable channel’s archives, the Warner Bros. vault, Studio Ghibli, Looney Tunes, Sesame Street and Turner Classic Movies.</p><p>If you pay for HBO from one of the major TV providers, then congratulations — you probably already have access to the full Max experience. Just activate your account and start streaming. Otherwise, you can subscribe directly over the internet. Max has a free 7-day trial, and costs $16 per month (or $150 a year) for the cheapest no-ads tier. You can pony up $20 per month, or $200 per year, for a no-ads tier that includes 4K streaming and four simultaneous streams. To get in on the ground floor, the ad-supported tier costs $10 per month.</p><p>Since launch, Max has come to more TV platforms and it's now available on Roku, Apple TV, Android TV, Samsung and others. You can also stream it via a browser, Sony and Microsoft’s game consoles or with mobile apps on Android and iOS. It also includes support for AirPlay and Google’s Cast feature, which help it work with more smart TVs than just the ones listed here.</p><p>Max content includes premium stuff that Warner yanked back from Netflix and others, like full series runs of <em>Friends</em> and <em>The Fresh Prince</em>, or DC Universe-related TV series and movies. The Max library speaks for itself, with <em>Game of Thrones</em>, <em>The Wire,</em><em>Band of Brothers</em>, and <em>Flight of the Conchords</em> or <em>Entourage, </em>and newer shows like <em>The Last of Us</em> and <em>The White Lotus</em>.</p><p>We should mention, however, that Max <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hbo-max-removing-shows-discovery-plus-203029015.html">canceled several shows</a> ahead of its Discovery+ merger as a cost-cutting move. It is deprioritizing kid and family content, leading to the removal of Sesame Street spin-offs and a handful of Cartoon Network titles. Movies like <em>Batgirl</em> and <em>Scoob!: Holiday Haunt</em> have also been axed. Despite these changes, Max still has one of the best content libraries of any TV streaming service and is worthy of consideration. <em>— R.L. and Nicole Lee, Commerce Writer</em></p><h2>Hulu</h2><p></p><p><a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ca19dea0-e7ad-4f54-beed-6302bce56589&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Hulu&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjYTE5ZGVhMC1lN2FkLTRmNTQtYmVlZC02MzAyYmNlNTY1ODkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaHVsdS5jb20vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwYmU2ZjhmNC0wNzRkLTM5MGYtOTZkNC0xM2U0MGJiZDYzYTIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAASAPHpjwz0CUfF44VCu8jIDmrqjyoZQSG9u5MX6MeFas&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hulu.com%2F">Hulu</a> started out as a bit of a curiosity — a joint venture by NBC, News Corp and a private equity firm to compete with Netflix by offering new episodes of TV shows. Then, after Disney joined up in 2009, bringing along its content from ABC and the Disney Channel, Hulu became a streaming network worth paying attention to. Today, Hulu's focus is still on recent TV episodes, but it also has a strong library of original series and films (like <em>The Handmaid's Tale</em> and <em>Only Murders in the Building</em>), as well as an archive of older TV and movies that often puts Netflix to shame.</p><p>Now that Disney owns a majority controlling stake in Hulu, following its acquisition of 21st Century Fox, the service is less of a collaboration between media giants. (Comcast still offers NBCUniversal content, but it can choose to have Disney buy out its shares as early as 2024.) Instead, it's yet another feather in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-focuses-on-streaming-203003919.html">Disney's increasingly important digital empire</a>, alongside Disney+ and ESPN+. That may not be a great thing for the competitiveness of streaming services in general, but for subscribers it means they can look forward to even more perks, like access to all of the FX shows that hit Hulu earlier this year.</p><p>Hulu subscriptions start at $8 a month (or $80 a year) with ads. You can also bump up to the ad-free plan for $15 a month (worth it for true TV addicts). The company's Live TV offering is considerably more expensive, starting at $70 a month with ads and $83 a month ad-free, but you do get Disney+ and ESPN+ services bundled in. Hulu allows two of your devices to stream at the same time, and you can also download some content for offline viewing. Hulu Live TV subscribers can also <a href="https://help.hulu.com/s/article/unlimited-screens?language=en-US">pay $10 a month</a> for unlimited streaming at home (and for up to three remote mobile devices).</p><p>Given that it's one of the longest-running streaming services out there, you can find Hulu apps everywhere, from TVs to set-top boxes. The company has been slow to adopt newer home theater technology, though — we're still waiting for surround sound on Apple TV and many other devices, and there's no HDR at all.<em> — Devindra Hardawar, Senior Editor</em></p><h2>Disney+</h2><p></p><p><a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=85d85ef3-fac9-418f-9573-418cf162cd0c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Disney%2B&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4NWQ4NWVmMy1mYWM5LTQxOGYtOTU3My00MThjZjE2MmNkMGMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGlzbmV5cGx1cy5jb20vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwYmU2ZjhmNC0wNzRkLTM5MGYtOTZkNC0xM2U0MGJiZDYzYTIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAc1ez3iwwr6zJUNImicIzjv-p7ycaRhxyo7l1sywf7u-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F&amp;uuid=Fmo8AtYSYDT8AdmF44289">Disney+</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-12-star-wars-mandalorian-disney-plus.html"> came out swinging</a>, leveraging all of the company's popular brands, like Star Wars, Pixar and Marvel.

And at $8 a month (or $80 a year), it's a lot cheaper than wrangling the kids for a night out at the movies (or even buying one of the Disney's over-priced Blu-rays). You can also get it bundled with ESPN+ and Hulu for $13 a month.<a href="https://www.engadget.com/verizon-fios-hulu-promotion-221352404.html"> Some Verizon FiOS and mobile customers</a> can also get Disney+, Hulu and ESPN for free.</p><p>Disney+ supports four simultaneous streams at once, and also lets you download films and shows for offline viewing. (That's particularly helpful when you're stuck in the car with no cell service and a crying toddler. Trust me.) You can access Disney+ on every major streaming device and most TV brands.

While they weren’t all hits initially (<em>See </em>you later, get it?), Apple TV+ has since amassed a slew of must-watch programming like <em>Ted Lasso</em>, <em>Severance</em>, and <em>For All Mankind</em>. Clearly, the iPhone maker is taking a different approach than Netflix or Disney, with a focus on quality and big celebrity names, rather than bombarding us with a ton of content. But that strategy seems to have paid off.</p><p>For $7 a month, there’s a ton of great shows and movies to dive into, including a number of National Geographic shows. But if you’re a dedicated Apple user, it may be worth moving up to an Apple One plan, which also bundles Apple Arcade, Apple Music, and 50GB of iCloud storage for $15 a month. Step up to $20 monthly, and you can bring in your whole family with up to 200GB of iCloud storage. And for $30 a month, Apple throws in News+ and Fitness+. <em>– D.H.</em></p><h2>YouTube TV</h2><p></p><p><a href="https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/">YouTube TV</a> is a great option for cord cutters who still want to watch live TV without having to sign up for a contract. It carries over 85 different channels, so it’s highly likely that you won’t miss your cable TV or satellite subscription at all if you switch over. YouTube TV even carries your regional PBS channels, which is a rarity on most live TV streaming services.</p><p>Where YouTube TV really shines is in the live sports department. Not only does it offer sports-carrying channels like CBS, FOX, ESPN, NBC, TBS and TNT, it also offers specific sports coverage networks like the MLB Network, NBA TV and the NFL Network. You can even opt for a Sports Plus package for an additional $11 a month if you want specific sports channels like NFL RedZone, FOX College Sports, GOLTV, FOX Soccer Plus, MAVTV Motorsports Network, TVG and Stadium. Unfortunately, however, YouTube TV recently lost the rights to carry Bally Sports regional networks, which means that you won’t get region-specific channels such as Bally Sports Detroit or Bally Sports Southwest.</p><p>One particularly strong selling point for sports fans is that instead of always remembering to record a particular game, you can just choose to “follow” a specific team and the DVR will automatically record all of its games. Plus, if you happen to have jumped into the match late, there’s a “catch up with key plays” feature that lets you watch all the highlights up until that point so that you’re up to speed.</p><p>YouTube TV is on the expensive side at $73 a month, which might not be much more than your basic cable package. If you want to add 4K viewing (which is currently only available through certain sporting events) plus unlimited streaming, you’d have to cough up an additional $20 a month. But a standard subscription includes channels such as BBC, BET, Comedy Central, the Food Network, MTV, Nickelodeon, USA, and more.</p><p>It currently offers one of the best cloud DVRs available. YouTube TV’s DVR has unlimited storage plus you have up to nine months to watch your recorded content before they expire. There are also no DVR up-charges here; you can rewind or fast forward through the recorded content as you please by default. We should note, however, that the on-demand content on YouTube TV does have ads which you can’t fast-forward through.</p><p>There’s also a plethora of premium channels that you can add for as low as $3 per month, such as Showtime, Max, Starz, Cinemax and EPIX. You can also subscribe to an Entertainment Plus bundle that includes Max, Showtime and Starz for $30 a month. Other niche add-ons include CuriosityStream, AMC Premiere, Shudder, Sundance Now, Urban Movie Channel, and Acorn TV. <em>— N.L.</em></p><h2>Hulu + Live TV</h2><p></p><p>Aside from on-demand and original content, Hulu also offers a <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ca19dea0-e7ad-4f54-beed-6302bce56589&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Hulu&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjYTE5ZGVhMC1lN2FkLTRmNTQtYmVlZC02MzAyYmNlNTY1ODkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaHVsdS5jb20vc3RhcnQvYWZmaWxpYXRlLWxpdmVUVj8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjBiZTZmOGY0LTA3NGQtMzkwZi05NmQ0LTEzZTQwYmJkNjNhMiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAc45lgehbaaAlKCePwcWBuv0jqwnxpyW09VrBJm8Ik1s&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hulu.com%2Fstart%2Faffiliate-liveTV%3F">Live TV</a> add-on that lets you stream over 80 channels without a cable or satellite subscription. It’ll cost $70 a month, but that includes access to both Disney+ and ESPN+. For an extra fee, you’ll also be able to watch on-demand shows without any ads, which can’t be said with YouTube TV. Hulu’s Live TV option also has unlimited DVR storage for up to nine months. That includes on-demand playback and fast-forwarding capabilities.</p><p>Hulu allows two simultaneous streams per account, but you can pay $15 more if you want unlimited screens (and up to three remote mobile devices). If you want, you can also add premium add-ons to your Hulu plan, such as Max, Cinemax, Showtime, or Starz.</p><p>Hulu’s Live TV service is a great option for sports fans, as it has access to a channel lineup that includes CBS, FOX, ESPN, NBC, TBS, TNT and more, all of which should deliver content for fans of most major sports like football, basketball and baseball. However, Hulu plus Live TV does not carry the NBA TV, MLB Network or regional sports networks, so you could miss out on additional sports coverage. <em>— N.L.</em></p><h2>ESPN+</h2><p></p><p>Without a doubt, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8b9dfafd-e7b1-4ac1-bb73-50d55c74d82d&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=ESPN&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4YjlkZmFmZC1lN2IxLTRhYzEtYmI3My01MGQ1NWM3NGQ4MmQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9wbHVzLmVzcG4uY29tLz8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjBiZTZmOGY0LTA3NGQtMzkwZi05NmQ0LTEzZTQwYmJkNjNhMiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATDkawsPbxnwxbHOzr-xQQunBx-RXL3-71AddqrEXL0l&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fplus.espn.com%2F%3F">ESPN’s standalone service</a> is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-02-espn-plus-keeps-getting-better.html">the best deal</a> in sports streaming. No one can compete with the network when it comes to the sheer volume of content. The platform hosts thousands of live college sporting events, plus MLB, MLS, NHL, NBA G League games and more. There’s plenty of pro tennis as well, and ESPN+ is an insane value for soccer fans.</p><p>On top of select MLS matches, ESPN+ is the US home of the Bundesliga (Germany) and the EFL cup (Carabao Cup). It’s also the spot for the UEFA Nations League international competition in Europe.</p><p>ESPN offers a slate of original shows and the full catalog of its 30 For 30 series on the service. And lastly, ESPN+ is the home of UFC. Fight Nights, Dana White’s Contender Series and other shows stream weekly or monthly, plus the app is how you access PPV events.</p><p>That’s a truckload of sports included in the $10 a month standard plan. If you splurge for the Disney bundle with Disney+ and Hulu (ad-supported), you can get all three for $14 per month. <em>— Billy Steele, Senior News Editor</em></p><h2>Paramount+</h2><p></p><p>Formerly CBS All Access, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=b0d3a482-802c-4eb1-9616-94f7490562f7&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Paramount+Plus&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJiMGQzYTQ4Mi04MDJjLTRlYjEtOTYxNi05NGY3NDkwNTYyZjciLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGFyYW1vdW50cGx1cy5jb20vPyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMGJlNmY4ZjQtMDc0ZC0zOTBmLTk2ZDQtMTNlNDBiYmQ2M2EyIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAV0lEzv9MoVXoMBnR_WY3ItB8OyCksYiuFdenTpc0bQk&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paramountplus.com%2F%3F">Paramount+</a> may get the most attention for originals like <em>Star Trek: Discovery</em>, <em>Star Trek: Picard </em>and <em>The Twilight Zone</em>, but it’s becoming a sports destination as well. The app began streaming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-11-national-womens-soccer-league-games-on-cbs-twitch.html">NWSL soccer matches</a> last summer when the league returned to the pitch. CBS also announced that All Access would be the live streaming home of the US women’s league. Unfortunately, you can’t watch every match there, but it’s a start.</p><p>Soon after, CBS added <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cbs-all-access-uefa-champions-league-football-152021183.html">UEFA Champions League and Europa League</a> soccer to its sports slate. The Champions League is the biggest competition in club soccer, pitting teams from various countries around the continent against each other to see who’s the best. Europa League does the same, but with less glory. Paramount+ is now the home of Series A soccer (Italy) and will broadcast CONCACAF World Cup qualifiers, which the US Men’s National Team will participate in.</p><p>At $6 a month with limited commercials, or $12 a month ad-free (with Showtime bundled in), Paramount+ isn’t a must have sports destination just yet. You can stream NFL games and more that air on your local CBS station inside the app, but the network is still filling out a well-rounded slate. For now, it’s more of a necessity for soccer fans than anything else. <em>— B.S.</em></p><h2>NBC Peacock</h2><p></p><p>NBC made it clear before <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=cbef8901-c2f3-4af7-b1b7-e2c3afcffd7a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Peacock+TV&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjYmVmODkwMS1jMmYzLTRhZjctYjFiNy1lMmMzYWZjZmZkN2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGVhY29ja3R2LmNvbS8_IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwYmU2ZjhmNC0wNzRkLTM5MGYtOTZkNC0xM2U0MGJiZDYzYTIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARo2OebTdpow0dfaXcbVY-jfrWMt5UinK3zHsZAbO4Wf&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.peacocktv.com%2F%3F">Peacock’s</a> debut that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peacock-premier-league-matches-streaming-nbc-sports-gold-160054895.html">Premier League soccer</a> would be available on the standalone service. What we didn’t expect was that the network would put so many games there, basically forcing anyone who’s more than a casual fan to subscribe. This is partially due to PL scheduling. In the US, that means you need the $6/month service and access to NBC Sports network (through cable TV or live TV streaming) to follow comprehensively.</p><p>NBCUniversal had a similar structure in the past where one game per time slot was broadcast on NBC Sports and NBC Sports Gold was used as the overflow. Gold was also the home to cycling, Olympic sports and more. Now the Premier League is being used to push the new service Peacock, and with the current scheduling format, even more games are relegated to streaming only. Thankfully, Peacock does offer match replays, so there’s some added value there if you can’t be parked in front of your TV all day on Saturday and Sunday. Games currently run from about 7:30AM ET to around 5PM ET (matches usually at 7:30AM, 10AM, 12:30PM and one around 2:30 or 3:00PM).</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/nbc-peacock-launch-everything-you-need-to-know-191032095.html">Peacock</a> also shows coverage of US Open tennis, NFL Wild Card games and will host “select events” from upcoming Olympics in Tokyo and Beijing. There’s also a smattering of sports talk shows available for free with paid users getting on-demand replays of Triple Crown horse racing and more. <em>— B.S.</em></p><h2>The Criterion Channel</h2><p></p><p>While it's easy to find modern films on Netflix and other streaming services these days, classic cinema is often tougher to find. FilmStruck tried to solve that problem, but it couldn't find <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-26-filmstruck-shut-down-warnermedia.html">a large enough audience to survive</a>. Now there's the <a href="https://www.criterionchannel.com/">Criterion Channel</a>, which delivers a rotating array of its cinephile-approved library for $11 a month or $100 a year. (Where else can you stream something like the incredible ramen noodle Western Tampopo?)</p><p>It's a service that's built for movie lovers: It's chock full of commentary tracks, conversations with writers and directors, and some of the company's renowned special features. The Criterion Channel also does a far better job at curating viewing options than other services. Its double features, for instance, pair together thematically similar films, like the classic noir entries Phantom Lady and Variety. What’s more, its editors make it easy to find all of the available films from a single director, for all of you auteur theory connoisseurs.</p><p>Sure, it costs a bit more than Hulu and Disney+, but The Criterion Channel gives you access to a library that's far more rewarding than the latest streaming TV show. You can watch on up to three devices at once, and there's also offline viewing available for iOS and Android devices. It also supports major streaming devices from Apple, Amazon and Roku, but as far as TV's go, it's only on Samsung's Tizen-powered sets. Unfortunately, The Criterion Channel is only available in the US and Canada, due to licensing restrictions. <em>— D.H.</em></p><h2>Shudder</h2><p></p><p>Sometimes, a good horror movie is the only way to deal with the constant anxiety of a potential climate apocalypse and the seeming downfall of modern society.

You'll find plenty of horror classics, like <em>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em>, but Shudder has also gotten into the original content game with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/host-review-shudder-horror-pandemic-130057058.html">unique films like Host</a>, which takes place entirely over a Zoom call.</p><p>If you're a bit squeamish, Shudder probably won't sell you much on horror. But for fans of the genre, it's a smorgasbord of content to dive into. You can try it out free for seven days, and afterwards it's $6 per month (or $57 annually). Shudder only supports viewing one stream at a time, and there's no support for offline viewing yet. You can find Shudder on major streaming device platforms, but since it's so niche, don't expect to find it on smart TVs anytime soon. <em>— D.H.</em></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-video-streaming-services-133000093.html?src=rss

## Tesla sued for false advertising after allegedly exaggerating EV ranges

<p>Tesla is already facing the fallout from a report that it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-allegedly-formed-a-team-to-quash-driving-range-complaints-164750696.html">exaggerated EV ranges</a> and tried to muffle complaints. Three owners in California have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/tesla-faces-california-class-action-its-ev-range-claims-2023-08-03/">launched</a> a proposed class action lawsuit accusing Tesla of false advertising. The trio claims their cars fell well short of their estimated ranges, and that they've had no success lodging complaints. The customers either wouldn't have bought their cars or would have paid considerably less for them, according to the suit.</p><p>The owners allege Tesla committed fraud, violated warranties and conducted unfair competition. If the lawsuit gets class action status, it would cover all people in California who bought a Tesla Model 3, Model S, Model X or Model Y. The plaintiffs are hoping for unspecified damages. Tesla has disbanded its communications team and isn't available for comment.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The lawsuit follows a <em>Reuters</em> report that Tesla began modifying EV ranges about a decade ago. Its cars would supposedly show inflated figures when fully charged, and would only start showing accurate numbers under a 50 percent charge. To head off complaints, the automaker is said to have created a &quot;Diversion Team&quot; that would persuade users to drop range-related support calls.</p><p>It's not certain that Tesla still uses these purported exaggerations. The Environmental Protection Agency did ask the company to trim its range estimates from the 2020 model year forward, and South Korea recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/south-korea-tesla-fine-ev-range-disclosure-cold-weather-153655339.html">issued a $2.2 million fine</a> over an alleged failure to adequately inform customers that EV ranges would drop in cold weather.</p><p>Tesla isn't alone in boasting EV range estimates that don't hold up in real conditions. An SAE International <a href="https://www.sae.org/publications/technical-papers/content/2023-01-0349/">study</a> found that electric cars tend to fall about 12.5 percent short of their advertised ranges. The report and lawsuit suggest Tesla's figures are less accurate than for other brands, however, and that the company may have tried to silence unhappy customers.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/tesla-sued-for-false-advertising-after-allegedly-exaggerating-ev-ranges-151034923.html?src=rss

<p>Waymo only <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-is-starting-driverless-taxi-tests-in-los-angeles-200542496.html">just reached Los Angeles</a> earlier this year, but that isn't stopping it from expanding further. The company is <a href="https://waymo.com/blog/2023/08/waymo-one-heads-to-austin.html">expanding</a> its Waymo One ride-hailing service to Austin. The first phase starts this fall, with completely driverless operations and public rides coming in the months ahead. The coverage will be &quot;truly useful,&quot; Waymo claims — it should cover major stretches of the Texas capital, including the downtown core as well as well-known areas like Barton Hills and Hyde Park. You can join a <a href="https://waymo.com/waitlist/">waitlist</a> today.</p><p>The deployment is a homecoming of sorts, as Waymo chose Austin to conduct <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-07-07-google-self-driving-tests-austin-texas.html">some of its first self-driving tests b</a>eyond its hometown of Mountain View. The company also made history by offering the first completely autonomous ride on public streets in 2015. The Alphabet-owned brand has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-brings-its-fleet-of-new-self-driving-suvs-to-austin-165720284.html">testing its self-driving SUVs</a> in the city since the spring.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Austin will represent the fourth city to get Waymo One following Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles. The firm is also operating <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-self-driving-cars-new-york-city-130044539.html">in New York City</a>, although it hasn't announced plans to offer commercial service in the region. While rides have typically only been available in limited sections of these cities, Waymo recently doubled its operational area to include larger swaths of the Phoenix area and San Francisco.</p><p>The announcement reflects Waymo's strengthened focus on ride-hailing. The company recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-pushes-back-its-self-driving-truck-efforts-to-focus-on-ride-hailing-211355559.html">pushed back its autonomous trucking plans</a> to help it concentrate on passenger service. Waymo wants One to be a commercial hit first, and that means expanding operations as well as securing permission to take paying customers. There's pressure to move quickly when competitors like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cruises-robotaxis-are-heading-to-houston-and-dallas-094531398.html">Cruise</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/toyota-aurora-robotaxi-texas-test-181751763.html">Aurora</a> are testing in Texas.</p><p>There are some obstacles to overall growth. Officials want to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/san-francisco-asks-california-regulators-to-halt-or-slow-driverless-vehicle-testing-083906662.html">stop or slow robotaxi deployments</a> in San Francisco over safety concerns, for instance. Vehicles from Waymo and GM's Cruise have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cruise-driverless-taxis-blocked-san-francisco-traffic-for-hours-robotaxi-gm-204000451.html">blocked traffic</a>, interfered with first responders and otherwise created issues.  Other cities and states haven't greenlit self-driving cars, either. Texas' openness to the technology may help, though, and Waymo notes that Austin's rapidly growing economy (the second-fastest for a major US city) could help its chances.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/waymo-is-bringing-its-driverless-ride-hailing-service-to-austin-133949180.html?src=rss

<p>Acura, Honda's luxury and performance vehicle brand, has released a teaser for its first electric vehicle. It doesn't really show much of the the all-electric 2024 ZDX — it's just a silhouette of the car with an illuminated grille in the shadows — but it comes with the announcement that the EV is set to debut on August 17th during the Monterey Car Week.&nbsp;</p><p>The 2024 ZDX was designed at the Acura Design Studio in Southern California, and it retains some of the external elements the company used for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/acura-precision-ev-concept-suv-italian-power-boats-f1-car-162037278.html">Precision EV Concept</a> it showed off during the same event last year. It's based on GM's Ultium battery platform and could perhaps be one of the few, or the only, Acura models to use the modular EV architecture. Honda previously said that future EVs will use its in-house e:Architecture platform instead, with the first models based on it slated <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/25/honda-says-first-earchitecture-based-ev-is-coming-sooner-than-planned/">for release in 2025</a>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Acura announced back in June that the ZDX will come with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/acura-zdx-ev-gets-android-auto-and-built-in-google-apps-161232778.html">built-in Android Auto and other Google products</a>. Owners will have access to an enhanced version of Google Maps, which can plan optimized routes with charging stations along the way and can estimate the charging time required to reach their destination. They'll also have access to Google Assistant for hands-free controls, as well as to Google Play, so they can download third-party apps to their infotainment system. Acura revealed last month that the EV will be equipped with a <a href="https://acuranews.com/en-US/releases/acura-and-bang-olufsen-launch-new-premium-audio-collaboration-for-all-future-acura-models">Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system</a>, as well.&nbsp;</p><p>The automaker will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/acuras-evs-will-be-sold-exclusively-online-starting-in-2024-140054959.html">exclusively sell</a> the ZDX and ZDX Type S performance EVs online starting early next year.

## ‘Star Trek: Strange New Worlds’ breaks into song

<p><em>The following article contains spoilers for “Subspace Rhapsody.”</em></p><p>At some point in the ‘90s, it became law that all genre shows with a certain flexibility in their premise <em>must</em> do a musical episode. <em>Xena, Ally McBeal, Buffy, Psych, Grey’s Anatomy </em>and<em> Scrubs </em>have all done one, as has <em>Supernatural, Once Upon a Time, 7th Heaven, Supergirl</em> and <em>The Flash. </em>Now, it’s <em>Strange New Worlds’</em> turn to make its characters spontaneously burst into song as it drops “Subspace Rhapsody” as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-season-2-will-include-a-musical-episode-042558081.html">penultimate episode of its second season</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It’s clear from the start that <em>Strange New Worlds</em> was well-suited to do a musical given how broad its range is. In the last four weeks alone, we’ve had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-drops-its-lower-decks-crossover-early-230033262.html">goofy comedy</a> served up back to back with serious meditations on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-finds-empathy-in-memory-130048301.html">empathy</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-probes-the-limits-of-redemption-130025700.html">redemption</a>. This is the first live action Trek of the streaming era to remember the franchise gets better when it allows itself to be goofy. The only surprise is that this is coming so early on its run; this is just the nineteenth episode of the series overall.</p><p>Musical episodes serve several purposes: It allows the cast to show off their hidden talents and lets the production crew indulge their latent musical theater nerd. They’re also, in many cases, a useful narrative crucible, forcing characters to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Once_More,_with_Feeling_(Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer)">reveal secrets</a> they’d otherwise never let out. It’s an old trick to use the primary colors of a rousing number to drop something deep and dark on an audience. This comes in handy given the number of running storylines in the back of each episode, which get resolved more or less all in one go.</p><figure><img alt="L-R Rebecca Romijn as Una and Paul Wesley as James T.

Spock believes it could be used to speed up communication over long distances, but despite several tries, he and Uhura can’t make it work. Not until Pelia suggests they test the system using music, so Uhura fires up Anything Goes and sends it into the ether. Before you can say that’s-a-good-macguffin, a large subspace wave hits the ship and sends everyone singing.</p><p>As this is happening, Pike and Batel – who I can’t believe Pike didn’t dump after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-110-a-quality-of-mercy-review-130037849.html">arresting</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-finds-the-limit-of-what-a-prequel-can-say-130027427.html">prosecuting</a> his first officer – argue about holiday destinations. Chapel has received word she’s been accepted for a prestigious fellowship with a high-profile academic. She’ll be away for a while but declines to share her news with Spock after the fraying of their relationship last week. And, to further complicate matters, James T. Kirk is back on board to shadow Una in preparation for his own promotion. But when they start spouting technobabble as lyrics and feeling the urge to dance, we’re straight into an acapella rendition of the theme tune.</p><p>I’ve pointed out, too frequently this year, the confidence<em> Strange New Worlds</em> has in its own execution. This is the second time in three weeks that it’s not just screwed with its format but also its packaging in the form of its opening credits. It’s evidence of a show that knows it has the patience from its audience to play around with its formatting.</p><p>Urged on by Pike, stuck firmly in his eyebrow-raising sick-of-this-malarkey mode, the team find they’re trapped in a state of quantum uncertainty. They’re in a universe that follows the rules of a musical, so when emotions are high, people are likely to burst into song. That’s bad for La’an, who is struggling to contain her feelings with her alternate-history beau on board, especially since she’s prohibited from talking about it. Pike, too, starts to confess his misgivings about the holiday he and Captain Batel have been planning. La’an gets a solo about being emotionally shut off from the rest of the crew, followed soon after with a duet with Una talking about why it’s good to open up.</p><p>The improbability field starts to expand, encompassing more starships in the area and reaching Klingon territory. They soon dispatch a cruiser to shut it down, but the Enterprise crew discover that shooting the fissure will release enough energy to wipe out the quadrant. Uhura posits that, if they’re in a musical, their behavior might have to follow the tropes of the genre. Armed with a tricorder, she drags Spock to the bar where he bumps into Chapel, who then dumps him with a full-cast song-and-dance number about the importance of her career. He responds by singing his own solo in engineering in which he talks about his abandonment of logic and reason for love, a mistake he won’t make again.</p><p>La’an, who has spent more and more time with Kirk, decides to open up a little bit only to find her advances rebuffed. Not because he doesn’t feel similarly, but because he’s in an on-again, off-again relationship with a scientist called Carol. And that Carol is currently pregnant with Kirk’s child, who we might not get to see again until <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Trek_II:_The_Wrath_of_Khan">Kirk looks a lot more like William Shatner</a>. (This episode has more than a few moments where it’s consciously drawing attention to its “evolution” into <em>The Original Series</em>.)</p><p>Spock’s judgment may be clouded but Uhura, whose awareness of musical tropes has been key all episode, spots the solution. In order to pop the uncertainty field, the whole crew needs to do a big full-cast finale, but not before Uhura gets her own solo. At Pike’s urging, Uhura gets on the ship’s PA and inspires the whole crew – complete with dancing redshirts and balletic starship dances to produce a showstopper climax. We even get a blast of the Original Series’ theme to underpin their victory, while Spock goes off to smooth things over with the Klingons and get over his split with another round of heavy drinking.</p><p>Much as the ending is ostensibly happy, with everyone learning the lesson to be more honest and authentic with each other, there’s trouble on the horizon. Batel has to cancel her holiday with Pike, she’s being sent on a top secret mission which, I’m sure, is our lead in to the finale. Spock’s nursing his grief, and the rest of his supersized emotions, while La’an has to deal with the ramifications of her not-quite-requited love.</p><figure><img alt="Celia Rose Gooding as Uhura in Star Trek: Strange New Worlds streaming on Paramount+, 2023.

The script, credited to Dana Horgan and Bill Wolkoff, efficiently and effectively works in the musical universe concept without a lot of setup. Demott Downs’ direction blends the closed nature of Strange New Worlds’ standing sets with the necessary scope a musical demands. And the songs, from Letters to Cleo’s Kay Hanley and Tom Polce, are perfectly fine. Musical lovers will have a greater appetite for enjoying each track on a loop, but as a casual enjoyer of the artform, I’m not sure how many would enter my regular Spotify rotation.</p><p>Obviously, much of the dramatic weight of the episode hangs on the shoulders of the cast members who can sing. Christina Chong, Jess Bush, Rebecca Romijn, Ethan Peck and Celia Rose Gooding all get showpiece numbers and boy, can they all sing. But that’s not to shade the names not on that list, especially those who are getting by with the help of autotune. It’s hard enough to sing and dance even if you’ve got years of experience behind you, let alone if you’re dropped into the deep end in an acting job. Now, onward to the finale!</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-breaks-into-song-130044077.html?src=rss

## The Morning After: Are Samsung’s folding screens sturdy enough?

<p>For all the hype around folding phones, there’s plenty of anxiety concerning how well those bendable screens survive long term. Depending on who you ask, they’re either weaker than spider silk or hardy enough to make your average lumberjack weep with envy. That’s why Sam Rutherford took matters into his own hands, spending the last year running his <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-durability-report-has-samsung-finally-fixed-its-foldable-phones-biggest-weakness-133015335.html"><ins>own durability test</ins></a>. He’s been using his Z Fold 4 without a case, leaving its factory-installed screen protector as the only defense.</p><p>At the dawn of the Z Fold 5, Rutherford is now ready to reveal how well he got on with its predecessor. Turns out that while the frame is now chipped and scratched, the screens “still look great,” with Samsung’s work in this area paying off. Unfortunately, the same can’t be said for a similar experiment undertaken on a Z Flip 4, the more pocketable handset in the lineup. In that case, it might be wise to make sure you live close to an authorized service center, so you’re not left without a phone for a week at a time.</p><p>– Dan Cooper</p><p>​​<em>You can get these reports delivered daily, direct to your inbox. </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em>Subscribe right here!</em></a>​​</p><h3>The biggest stories you might have missed</h3><h3></h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/alienware-announces-a-new-look-aurora-r16-desktop-070153737.html"><ins>Alienware announces a new-look Aurora R16 desktop</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-gamers-can-now-stream-directly-to-discord-150045129.html"><ins>Xbox gamers can now stream directly to Discord</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-releases-an-open-source-ai-kit-that-creates-audio-from-text-prompts-152026368.html"><ins>Meta releases an open source AI kit that creates audio from text prompts </ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/googles-chrome-updates-bring-improved-search-to-mobile-and-simpler-desktop-downloads-160003908.html"><ins>Google's Chrome updates bring improved search to mobile and simpler desktop downloads</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-brings-mario-kart-8-and-splatoon-for-wii-u-back-online-august-3rd-165434085.html"><ins>Nintendo brings 'Mario Kart 8' and 'Splatoon' for Wii U back online August 3rd</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/bytedance-sued-for-allegedly-collecting-biometric-data-without-consent-172411924.html"><ins>ByteDance sued for allegedly collecting biometric data without consent </ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-sonos-move-2-will-reportedly-offer-stereo-audio-and-24-hour-battery-life-181950125.html"><ins>The Sonos Move 2 will reportedly offer stereo audio and 24-hour battery life</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-irs-wants-to-phase-out-most-irl-tax-documents-by-2025-192105265.html"><ins>The IRS wants to phase out most IRL tax documents by 2025 </ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ai-assisted-cancer-screening-could-cut-radiologist-workloads-in-half-193427969.html"><ins>AI-assisted cancer screening could cut radiologist workloads in half</ins></a></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/china-considers-limiting-kids-smartphone-time-to-two-hours-per-day-134708060.html"><ins>China considers limiting kids' smartphone time to two hours per day</ins></a></h2><h3>It’s another initiative to reduce smartphone addiction.</h3><p></p><p>Draft legislation proposed by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/china-considers-limiting-kids-smartphone-time-to-two-hours-per-day-134708060.html"><ins>would further limit phone use for under 18s</ins></a>.

## X sued by AFP over not discussing payments for news content

<p>Elon Musk and X, the site formerly known as Twitter, are in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-is-taking-his-sec-fight-to-the-supreme-court-161255874.html">more legal trouble</a>. <a href="https://www.afp.com/en/agency/press-releases-newsletter/afp-takes-legal-action-against-twitter-enforce-news-agencies-and-publishers-neighbouring-rights">The Agence France-Presse (AFP) is suing X</a> for not engaging in discussions about payment to the French publisher in exchange for its articles appearing on the platform. In 2019, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/france-google-scraping-stories-snippets-104038211.html">France passed neighboring rights legislation</a>, extending copyright law to content produced by news publishers, such as text and videos, for two years after release. The law requires any sites that share this work to negotiate with the publishers about remuneration instead of sharing it without compensation for its creators.&nbsp;</p><div id="c3e2ffbe71714056ba64313abc4be84d"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">This is bizarre. They want us to pay *them* for traffic to their site where they make advertising revenue and we don’t!?</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1686927028644179968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 3, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>In its press release, the AFP stated that it has &quot;expressed its concerns over the clear refusal from Twitter (recently rebranded as 'X') to enter into discussions regarding the implementation of neighbouring rights for the press. These rights were established to enable news agencies and publishers to be remunerated by digital platforms which retain most of the monetary value generated by the distribution of news content.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>X isn't the first tech company AFP has gone up against. In 2020, France's competition authority ordered Google to enter negotiations with publishers, and, while it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-agreement-french-publishers-content-100220969.html">reached an agreement in early 2021</a>, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/france-google-antitrust-fine-news-publishers-143000932.html">company was fined €500 million</a> ($546 million) later that year for not reaching a fair agreement. In that case, part of the argument was that Google owns 90 percent of the search market, leaving them in a position where they could abuse their power if an equitable deal wasn't reached. Twitter's influence in this area of the internet isn't nearly as strong, so we'll have to wait and see if it will face the same fight.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/x-sued-by-afp-over-not-discussing-payments-for-news-content-105501199.html?src=rss

<p>No matter the level of success a tech company has seen for certain products, at least one device always fails to meet expectations after launch. Amazon experienced this for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-07-22-amazon-fire-phone-review.html">quickly discontinued Fire phone</a>, and Meta is seeing it for everything from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-meta-flunked-its-first-year-as-a-metaverse-company-150049067.html">disinterest in the Metaverse</a> to, reportedly, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ray-ban-stories-smart-glasses-ar-160006477.html">Ray-Ban Stories</a>, its smart sunglasses. According to an internal Meta document <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2f007401-3eaa-4237-b69b-54ccbe125502&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Wall+Street+Journal&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyZjAwNzQwMS0zZWFhLTQyMzctYjY5Yi01NGNjYmUxMjU1MDIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9tZXRhcy1yYXktYmFuLXNtYXJ0LWdsYXNzZXMtZmFpbC10by1jYXRjaC1vbi0zMWY2YmE0ZT9tb2Q9ZTJ0d2QiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImQ4Y2MzYzVhLWU4NzEtNDNlMC04N2M3LTQ0NmZhOGIwNzI2YSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAdf64c6xA4znB45aa1OPuGyojss-y70hQYri-4sQdPiy&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Fmetas-ray-ban-smart-glasses-fail-to-catch-on-31f6ba4e%3Fmod%3De2twd">viewed by <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>,</a> less than ten percent of people with Ray-Ban Stories regularly use the product.</p><p>Ray-Ban sold about 300,000 of the glasses between their launch in September 2021 and February 2023 — when Meta conducted the report. At that time, there were only 27,000 monthly active users, with the company citing issues such as poor connectivity and issues with battery life. Yes, these people already bought the sunglasses, so that's something for the companies, but the low retention doesn't exactly instill confidence in continual sales. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-q3-2022-earnings-211903277.html">Meta's Reality Labs division</a>, which the Ray-Ban partnership falls under, isn't doing well either, with an almost $8 million loss over the first half of 2023.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>However, Meta is set to release a new generation of Ray-Ban Stories in either the fall or spring. Apparently, the new glasses will have improved battery life and cameras and be available in more than the current three sunglass models.

The Pro X features an entirely new layout and a unique sound engine.

Additionally, the Pro X boasts a 64-step paraphonic sequencer, with step and real-time recording options, and a 10-mode arpeggiator with a pattern designer.

## Nintendo sees record first quarter profit thanks to Zelda and the Mario movie

<p>Nintendo just announced its highest first quarter profit ever thanks to sales of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em>. The company earned 185.44 billion yen ($1.3 billion) on sales of 461.34 billion yen ($3.2 billion), easily battering its previous fiscal Q1 record of 144.7 billion set in 2020, the company revealed in its latest <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2023/230803_2e.pdf">earnings report</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The numbers on those two properties are impressive. Around the world, 168.10 million people watched <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie,</em> netting the company $1.349 billion as of July 26th — the highest ever for an original film based on a video game, and the second-highest for an animated film.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Meanwhile, <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom </em>has sold 18.51 million copies since it launched in May, while <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> sold 1.67 million units last quarter. &quot;Sell-through of this one title [Zelda] constitutes approximately half of the first-party software sold this fiscal year,&quot; Nintendo said.&nbsp;</p><p>Switch sales were actually up over the same quarter last year to 3.91 million in the last quarter (compared to 3.43 million units last year), with 2.83 million of those being the more expensive OLED model. That rise might be powered in part by <em>Zelda</em>, as buyers sought either a new or better console to play the game. The company has also continually stated that it's goal is to put more than one Switch in every household, and could be starting to deliver on that. At the beginning of its fiscal year, Nintendo called its sales forecast of 15 million Switch consoles &quot;a bit of a stretch,&quot; but is on track to achieve that number so far.&nbsp;</p><p>It may be tough for Nintendo to maintain that momentum, though. Upcoming games include the side-scroller <em>Super Mario Bros Wonder</em> (October 20th), <em>Detective Pikachu Returns</em> (October 6th), <em>WarioWare: Move It</em>! (November 3rd) and <em>Super Mario RPG</em> with updated graphics on November 17th. There are no marquee games in that list like <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, though, and sales of that game (and movie profits) are bound to keep dropping off.&nbsp;</p><p>As for the Switch, it's now six years old, and Nintendo has yet to announce its replacement. Rumors have <a href="https://gamerant.com/new-nintendo-console-switch-2-rumors-leaks-reveal-when/">swirled</a> that a next-gen Switch arrive in 2024, but none have much substance behind them.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-sees-record-first-quarter-profit-thanks-to-zelda-and-the-mario-movie-075718094.html?src=rss

## X Blue subscribers can now download videos from the website

<p>X, the social network formerly known as Twitter, is now letting users download videos from its website, as long as a couple of criteria are met. First, the creator must explicitly allow downloads for the content they post. Also, the ability to save videos from the website is exclusively available to verified users comprised mostly of people paying for Blue subscription. Elon Musk has <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1686941773824757761">announced</a> the new feature on his account and explained that a verified user can download content by tapping the ellipsis (...) menu on the upper right corner of the screen when a video is in full screen mode. Musk also said that X will soon make it easy to download videos on mobile simply by tapping and holding the content on the screen.</p><p>Previously, people have had to use to third-party websites and apps to be able to save videos. Of course, non-paying users still have to use those tools if they want to download content from X. That doesn't come as a surprise, seeing as the company has been releasing new features specifically for paying members while making the website less usable for the rest of its userbase. It announced in July that it will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-is-limiting-the-number-of-dms-unverified-users-can-send-120035602.html">limit the number of DMs</a> non-paying users can send to address its spam issues, and it also previously limited the number of posts <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-puts-strict-cap-on-how-many-tweets-users-can-read-each-day-182623928.html">non-verified users can see</a> to 600 a day.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Meanwhile, X gave verified users the ability to publish posts with up to 25,000 characters and allowed them to post videos up to three hours in length. More recently, it also gave Blue subscribers the option to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/x-blue-subscribers-can-now-hide-their-checkmarks-110229094.html">hide their blue checkmark</a> in case they don't want to make it obvious that they're paying for the service. For those interested to see how X has evolved since Elon Musk took over Twitter, company CEO Linda Yaccarino has just published the list of changes it has implemented <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2023/building-the-future-of-x">right here</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/x-blue-subscribers-can-now-download-videos-from-the-website-065336710.html?src=rss

<p>Meta has teamed up with UFC to bring live mixed martial arts (MMA) in VR to Horizon Worlds, the company announced in a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/2/23818083/meta-ufc-horizon-worlds-virtual-reality-quest">Quest Blog post</a> seen by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/2/23818083/meta-ufc-horizon-worlds-virtual-reality-quest"><em>The Verge</em></a>. The experience, launching in November, will let UFC Fight Pass subscribers (via Xtadium and YBVR streaming) watch MMA action at 4K resolution and 180-degree VR capture on Horizon Worlds. &quot;Enjoy the action alone or with friends and switch camera angles throughout the fight to get the best view of every matchup,&quot; Meta wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>Users will also be able to discuss UFC with other Horizon Worlds users, check out a virtual version of the Octagon and compete in single player and multiplayer in-world games to gain unlockable rewards — all with the goal of becoming a UFC &quot;Hall of Famer.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="ed43af0db7424ec0ba93556bde6e2dcf"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>The new experience is one of a number of ways Meta is attempting to lure users to Horizon Worlds. Recently, the company added <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-adds-quests-to-horizon-worlds-to-keep-users-returning-to-the-metaverse-123100954.html">Quests</a> to keep users returning to the virtual worlds, including mini-games like <em>Giant Paddle Mini Golf,</em><em>Arena Clash</em> and <em>Bad Roommates. </em>It also recently introduced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-meta-super-rumble-game-is-the-first-of-many-next-gen-horizon-worlds-vr-titles-130141631.html"><em>Rumble World</em></a>, the first of many next-gen Horizon Worlds games featuring improved graphics and more complex gameplay.&nbsp;</p><p>Meta said it latched onto UFC due to the &quot;engagement and passion of this audience,&quot; noting that fans enjoy not just the fights but also sharing the experience with other fans. &quot;We tested this technology successfully with a handful of MMA events last year, and now we’re going further,&quot; says MMA chief content officer Craig Borsari. &quot;We’re just scratching the surface of how we can use this technology to create greater fan engagement and grow this sport.&quot;</p><p>UFC also makes sense on Meta given CEO Mark Zuckerberg's apparent interest in the sport (though his cage match with Elon Musk <a href="https://www.engadget.com/looks-like-the-zuck-vs-musk-fight-isnt-happening-195538503.html">seems doubtful</a> at the moment). In any case, live sports may be a potent way to attract new users to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/metas-horizon-worlds-is-opening-to-young-teens-in-the-us-and-canada-194600914.html">reportedly flagging</a> service, so it'll be interesting to see if Meta adds others along with UFC.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/meta-is-launching-a-ufc-themed-vr-experience-in-horizon-worlds-060904144.html?src=rss

<p>Now might be your chance if you've been in the market for a new gaming computer but haven't found the right one. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/alienware-reveals-revamped-gaming-peripherals-220044252.html">Alienware</a> has announced the launch of its Aurora R16 desktop, an updated version of its flagship computer. Though the Aurora R16 is being released less than a year after the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dell-alienware-aurora-r15-annouced-162020419.html">Aurora R15</a>, it features a different design and features than its predecessor.&nbsp;</p><p>At a quick glance, you'll notice that the line's former triangle shape is gone in favor of the rectangular Legend 3 design Alienware rolled out with its gaming laptops earlier this year. Yet, the Aurora 16 is 40 percent smaller than its predecessor while maintaining the same internal volume and, thus, upgradability. It also debuts the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/alienware-x-14-review-a-portable-gaming-laptop-that-doesnt-suck-143013640.html">Alienware Command Center</a> for desktops.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Additional features of Alienware's Aurora R16 desktop include 20 percent lower acoustics, seven percent lower temperatures and up to ten percent lower CPU than the Aurora R15. It also brings larger air intakes and exhausts, with a 54.5 percent larger open ratio. Plus, the Aurora R16 has two M.2 PCIe slots providing up to 8TB of storage and supports Wi-Fi 6E and 2.5 Gbps ethernet. Alienware's Aurora R16 desktop is available now for $1,750. It will offer RTX 4070 or RTX 4070 Ti in the US and Canada, while European and Asian markets will also have RTX 3050 and RTX 4080.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/alienware-announces-a-new-look-aurora-r16-desktop-070153737.html?src=rss
