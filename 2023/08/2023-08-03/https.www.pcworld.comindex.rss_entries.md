## Braveâ€™s search engine is now totally independent from Google and Bing

<p>Brave said Thursday that it has now completely separated its own search capabilities from Google and Microsoft Bing, allowing any search query within the Brave browser to be searched entirely by Brave itself.</p>



<p>Based on the company&rsquo;s previous claim that &ldquo;Brave Search is 100 percent private and anonymous,&rdquo; the change would mean that Brave Search would now be completely private, regardless of what you now search for. Brave is one of a handful of niche browsers, along with Opera, Vivaldi, Firefox, and more, that address a tiny niche of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407176/best-web-browsers.html">browser market</a> that&rsquo;s dominated by Google Chrome, then Microsoft Edge. </p>



<p>Until now, Brave&rsquo;s own search engine had crawled the Internet by itself, developing its own database for search queries. But its image and video search had used Bing and Google. Brave said in a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://brave.com/image-video-search/&amp;xcust=2-1-2019048-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> that it had begun removing Bing as a source of image results, but had offered to redirect its own searches to the two search engines, Bing and Google, during that transition. That redirection has now been turned off, and all of Brave&rsquo;s results are now compiled internally.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">

</blockquote>



<p>&ldquo;[B]y keeping all searches within the Brave ecosystem, users benefit from increased speed and privacy when compared with the multiple search engines that rely on third-party providers,&rdquo; Brave said.</p>



<p>&ldquo;By serving image/video results directly from Brave Search&rsquo;s independent index, we can ensure a better check on Big Tech censorship and put our users in charge of their browsing experience,&rdquo; the company added.</p>



<p>For now, however, Brave&rsquo;s image-searching capabilities are somewhat rudimentary. Advanced filters, for example, that filter an image based upon the license type or the aspect ratio, aren&rsquo;t available but will be soon, Brave promised. &ldquo;For now, we believe offering a clear alternative is more important than complete feature parity,&rdquo; the company said.</p>

## Woohoo! You can get a Raspberry Pi again

<p>If you&rsquo;ve been on the hunt for a Raspberry Pi in the last couple of years, you know just how hard it&rsquo;s been to get one. Supply went down and prices shot up, and what used to be an affordable $35 single-board computer became quite expensive. But earlier this year, the group that produces the Raspberry Pi said many more would start hitting shelves by summer. And as promised, it appears that&rsquo;s finally happening.</p>



<p>For the first part of the year, output was relatively low&mdash;around <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/still-cant-buy-a-raspberry-pi-board-things-arent-getting-better-anytime-soon/&amp;xcust=2-3-2019043-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">400,000 per month</a>, with most of them going to commercial buyers rather than tinkerers and enthusiasts. Then in June, the Raspberry Pi foundation announced that number <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1939160/at-last-the-raspberry-pi-shortage-is-finally-coming-to-an-end.html">would double to 800,000 that month</a>, and then climb further to 1 million in July. This dramatic uptick in supply seems to be having an effect too, according to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/some-shops-will-let-you-buy-more-than-one-raspberry-pi-at-a-time-again/&amp;xcust=2-3-2019043-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Ars Technica</a>: Availability appears to be returning to normal for some Pi models. In fact, a tracker for Raspberry Pi stock said that <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/rpilocator/status/1686046927568203776&amp;xcust=2-3-2019043-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">it&rsquo;s issuing fewer automated alerts</a> as of late.</p>

<p>Which boards are in stock will depend on your region&mdash;UK-based buyers seem to have more available to them, with retailers like UK-based Pimoroni doing away with quantity restrictions on 2GB and 4GB Raspberry Pi 4 and Pi Zero W boards at purchase. You can also pick up the 8GB RPi 4 through <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://thepihut.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b&amp;xcust=2-3-2019043-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">The Pi-Hut</a>. Meanwhile in the US, you can nab the 2GB Raspberry Pi 4 from <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-4-2gb.html&amp;xcust=2-3-2019043-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Canakit</a>, the 4GB model from <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15447&amp;xcust=2-3-2019043-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Sparkfun</a>, and the 8GB board from <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://chicagodist.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b-8gb&amp;xcust=2-3-2019043-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Chicago Electronic Distributors</a>. Meanwhile, the Raspberry Pi Zero W can be picked up via <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.pishop.us/product/raspberry-pi-zero-w/&amp;xcust=2-3-2019043-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">PiShop.us</a>, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14277&amp;xcust=2-3-2019043-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Sparkfun</a>, and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://chicagodist.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w&amp;xcust=2-3-2019043-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Chicago Electronic Distributors</a>. Fans of the newer Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W will have to keep waiting for now, unfortunately&mdash;that one remains widely out of stock.</p>



<p>The patchy availability of Raspberry Pi boards isn&rsquo;t the only lingering side effect of the pandemic&mdash;prices remain higher for the $45 2GB RPi 4. You&rsquo;ll pay about $10 per board compared to early 2020, when the 2GB dropped down to the $35 price of the 1GB model. It&rsquo;s not too much of a markup&mdash;and it matches the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-4-on-sale-now-from-35/&amp;xcust=2-3-2019043-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">original launch price</a>&mdash;but it shows that while nature is healing, it isn&rsquo;t completely done repairing itself yet. </p>



<p>But being able to get your hands on a Raspberry Pi 4 at a reasonable price is still exciting.

## The Excel World Championship returns with a high-stakes esports format

<p>Excel nerds, it&rsquo;s time to start boning up on your pivot tables! The Excel Financial Modeling World Cup is back, and this time it&rsquo;s even more tense than before: every five minutes, the player with the least amount of points will be eliminated.</p>



<p>The latest iteration of the Excel World Championship takes place on &ldquo;the Ocho&rdquo; on Friday, bright and early at 7 am ET. The Ocho, aka ESPN8, is ESPN&rsquo;s movie-inspired celebration of weird sports from around the world, with everything from Fierste Ljepper pole climbing to slamball to the championship of pillow fighting. But really, who wants to watch that when they can watch financial nerds virtually duke it out?</p>



<p>People stuck inside their homes during the 2020-2021 pandemic latched on to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/559001/the-future-of-esports-is-microsoft-excel-and-its-on-espn.html">the viral trend that was the 2021 Excel World Cup</a>, where hundreds of thousands tuned in to watch Andrew &ldquo;NGOAT&rdquo; Ngai defeat Michael Jarman. The format then allowed for competitors to go head-to-head in an elimination format, allowing each competitor 30 minutes to solve the problem while a team of Excel commentators (yes, there is such a thing) happily analyzed the gameplay. Think <em>The Great British Bake Off </em>meets spreadsheets, basically.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>In 2023, there&rsquo;s a new wrinkle &mdash;  one that threatens to resort the columns, you might say. This time around, the Excel competition will boot out the competitor with the least amount of points every five minutes. Most accountants and financial analysts are used to thinking through a problem logically, setting it up, teasing it out over a period of time. Now, it&rsquo;s like speed chess for spreadsheets!</p>



<p>Expect to see the Excel World Cup all-stars go head to head: Diarmuid Early, Andrew Ngai, Brittany Deaton, Michael Holmes, David Brown, Alana Reid, Isaac Lee, and Emilie Williams. Excel MVPs Leila Gharani, Oz du Soleil, and &ldquo;Mr. Excel&rdquo; Bill Jelen will have the call, which will be shown on ESPN as well as on YouTube. </p>



<p>Want to learn more? Spreadsheet superstar Jason Moore gave us an <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/611293/secrets-of-an-excel-esports-player-how-pros-tap-the-true-power-of-spreadsheets.html">in-depth look at the Financial Modelling World Cup</a> in 2022. (We&rsquo;re crushed to see that Jason Moore won&rsquo;t be participating this year.)</p>



<p>Can&rsquo;t wait? Neither can we. Even though the competition takes place tomorrow, there are already several people waiting in the YouTube stream. And who can blame them?</p>

## Microsoft begins pulling the plug on Cortana

<p>Microsoft has begun following through on its promise to kill off Cortana, the AI assistant that debuted in Windows 10.</p>



<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s recent Windows Insider build in the Dev channel <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.windowslatest.com/2023/08/03/microsoft-just-killed-the-cortana-app-on-windows-11-in-favour-of-ai/&amp;xcust=2-1-2018918-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">turns off Cortana</a>, which only appears as an app within the Microsoft Store. If you apply an available update to the Cortana app, that will essentially turn it off: You&rsquo;ll receive a message saying that Cortana has been deprecated &mdash; programmer-speak for turning off a specific feature.</p>



<p>Microsoft had made its intentions clear: In June, the company said that it would begin <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1940445/rip-cortana-microsoft-says-its-windows-ai-app-is-doomed.html">ending support for the Cortana app</a> in August. That doesn&rsquo;t mean Cortana is entirely gone. Microsoft did say that Cortana will still be available within Outlook Mobile and various versions of Teams, including Microsoft&rsquo;s conferencing solution, Teams Rooms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, Microsoft appears to be backing <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1924008/windows-copilot-will-bring-ai-into-windows-11.html">Windows Copilot, which brings AI into Windows 11</a> via a web interface to Bing Chat. The problem is that while <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/428642/meet-cortana-the-ultimate-guide-to-windows-10s-helpful-digital-assistant.html">Cortana debuted in Windows 10</a> (!) as an AI assistant that could author email, set reminders, and search the web, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1974843/windows-copilot-cant-decide-what-it-is.html">many of these features have yet to make it into Windows Copilot</a>. Copilot, while a sophisticated search engine, can&rsquo;t really do any more than the Cortana app can do right now. </p>



<p>Microsoft hasn&rsquo;t commented further on its decision to kill off Cortana, but it&rsquo;s likely testing the deprecation of the app in the Dev Channel to determine if its absence will provoke any additional bugs within your PC. The company still maintains a Cortana page, including <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/what-can-you-do-with-cortana-in-windows-f57ef46f-716a-9940-a8fc-09b3433d05ea&amp;xcust=2-1-2018918-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">what you can do with Cortana on Windows</a>. If the current deprecation process goes smoothly, however, expect Cortana to quietly fade away on the remaining userbase of Windows PCs.</p>

Not only does the XPS 17 come with a touchscreen panel, but it also has a 10-bit color depth and a 3840&times;2400 resolution. The laptop only weighs a little over five pounds, which isn&rsquo;t bad considering how much Dell managed to pack into this machine. It&rsquo;s full of excellent performance features such as an Intel 13th-gen Core i7-13700H processor and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 GPU, which should make quick work of any video or photo editing. It also comes with 1TB of SSD storage so you won&rsquo;t have to run out and buy an external hard drive anytime soon.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for an affordable 2-in-1, the HP Chromebook x2 11 tics all the right boxes. It&rsquo;s lightweight and portable, and the detachable keyboard and kickstand connect cleanly to the aluminum tablet. But the real star of the show here is the 11-inch 1440p touchscreen. In our review, the tester said the display was &ldquo;just plain lovely.&rdquo; Colors really pop and the touchscreen is super responsive and fluid. Plus, a wireless USI pen comes in the box. This is a great option for those who like to take notes or doodle.</p>

<p>Lenovo seems to always impress with its flagship Yoga 2-in-1 laptops and the latest Gen 8 version is no exception. With an updated 13th-gen Intel processor and a brilliant OLED display, Lenovo&rsquo;s new Yoga 9i surpasses the high bar set by previous versions. Under the hood you&rsquo;ll find the aforementioned Core i7 processor, Intel Iris Xe integrated graphics, 16GB of DDR5 RAM, and a 512GB SSD. All of those performance features are brilliantly fit into a svelte and sleekly designed laptop just over half an inch thick and weighing in around 3 pounds. In addition, it packs a 1080p webcam and good connectivity. But where the latest version really stands out is in its inclusion of a brilliant 2880&times;1880 OLED touchscreen display that even comes bundled with a stylus pen.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a tad bit more expensive than its predecessor, but that&rsquo;s to be expected with the upgrade to performance and the switch to an OLED display. Despite the higher price, the feature upgrades it brings to the table still make it good value for the money. Anyone who is looking to invest in a 2-in-1 at this time should put the Yoga 9i at the top of their list.</p>

<p>Need a touchscreen laptop that&rsquo;ll run as long as the Energizer Bunny? Look no further than the Dell Inspiron 16. When we ran our battery benchmark, which runs a laptop through a series of tasks and videos until the battery dies, the Inspiron 16 lasted a marathon 16.5 hours on a single charge. That&rsquo;s almost two full work days&mdash;or a really long Netflix binge. That large battery does make it a bit heavy, weighing in at 4.7 pounds, which is a more than some other 2-in-1s. The specs aren&rsquo;t bad either, sporting an Intel Core i7-1260P CPU, Intel Iris Xe graphics, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of SSD storage. That&rsquo;s powerful enough for multitasking, media editing, and more. The 16-inch display has a resolution of 1920&times;1080 and it also comes with a surprisingly robust quad speaker system. For ports, you&rsquo;re getting two USB Type-C, one USB-A 3.2 Gen 1, 1 HDMI, one SD card reader, and one 3.5mm audio jack.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re look for something a bit different, look no further than the Asus Zenbook Pro 14. It packs decent firepower with a Core i7 processor, RTX 3050 graphics, 16GB of DDR5 RAM, and a fast 1TB NVMe SSD. It also has a 14.5-inch 4K touch touch OLED main panel. But the truly intriguing feature is the secondary 12.7-inch 2880&times;864 screen located right above the keyboard. It is recognized as a second monitor and you can use it with all kinds of helpful tasks, such as setting it up as a trackpad or displaying a panel of touch controls for some Adobe apps. The only real drawback is the mediocre battery life, which means you&rsquo;ll likely need to carry around a charging cable while on the go. Despite this, the Zenbook Pro 14 Duo OLED is a well-tuned productivity machine complete with two high-quality and useful displays.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>



<p>The PCWorld team puts each and every Windows laptop through a series of benchmarks that test GPU and CPU performance, battery life, and so on. The idea is to push the laptop to its limits and then compare it against others we&rsquo;ve tested. Chromebooks, on the other hand, go through a series of web-based tests. It wouldn&rsquo;t be fair or possible to run the same kinds of tests on a Chromebook, as they&rsquo;re Chrome OS-based machines. Below, you&rsquo;ll find a breakdown of each test and the reasons why we run them. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="windows-laptops">Windows laptops</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>PCMark 10</strong>: PCMark 10 is how we determine how well the laptop handles lighter tasks like web browsing, word processing, spreadsheets, and so on.</li>



<li><strong>HandBrake</strong>: HandBrake is more intensive than PCMark 10. It basically measures how long a laptop&rsquo;s CPU takes to encode a beefy 30GB file. </li>



<li><strong>Cinebench</strong>: Cinebench is a brief stress test of the CPU cores. It does this by rendering a 2D scene over a short period of time.</li>



<li><strong>3DMark</strong>: 3DMark checks if 3D performance remains consistent over time by running graphic-intensive clips. </li>



<li><strong>Video rundown test</strong>: To gauge battery life, we loop a 4K video using Windows 10&rsquo;s Movies &amp; TV app until the laptop dies.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="chromebooks">Chromebooks</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>CrXPRT 2</strong>: The CrXPRT 2 benchmark tests a Chromebook&rsquo;s battery life. </li>



<li><strong>Speedometer 2.0</strong>: This test determines a Chromebook&rsquo;s web browser performance. It simulates this by adding, completing, and removing a to-do list.</li>



<li><strong>Basemark Web 3.0</strong>: This benchmark gauges how well a Chromebook can handle web-based applications. </li>



<li><strong>Kraken 1.1</strong>: Kraken 1.1 is a JavaScript performance benchmark. </li>



<li><strong>Jetstream 2</strong>: Jetstream 2 is a combination of WebAssembly and JavaScript benchmarks. This is a way to gauge how well a Chromebook runs advanced workloads.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-to-look-for-in-a-touchscreen-laptop">What to look for in a touchscreen laptop</h2>



<p>Ah, here we are at the billion dollar question. Do you spring for a basic Chromebook or go for a Windows laptop with more features? Well, it really depends on your personal lifestyle and what you plan on using your laptop for. For example, Chromebooks are a great low cost option for those who just want the basics. I use a Chromebook as my primary work laptop, as it has everything I need for both editing and writing. If you travel a bunch for work, it&rsquo;s probably a good idea to invest in a laptop with solid battery life. If you&rsquo;re still unsure, don&rsquo;t sweat it. I&rsquo;ve put together a list of quick tips below. </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Laptop type: </strong>The first question you should ask yourself is what kind of laptop you&rsquo;re looking for. There&rsquo;s traditional clamshells, 2-in-1&rsquo;s, Chromebooks, and much more. The displays on convertible laptops (aka 2-in-1&rsquo;s), for example, can swing around 360 degrees. This allows you to use the laptop like a tablet. They can also be propped up like a tent for viewing movies or participating in video calls. Chromebooks, on the other hand, exclusively run Google&rsquo;s web-focused Chrome OS and are generally used for everyday tasks. All you need is a Gmail account and boom, you&rsquo;re in. There are pros and cons to each of them. Chromebooks are affordable and generally have good battery life whereas convertibles are normally lightweight and portable.</li>



<li><strong>CPU: </strong>Intel processors are available in Core i3, Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9. The higher the number, the more powerful the CPU. (AMD&rsquo;s rival Ryzen processors use a similar naming scheme.) If you don&rsquo;t need a ton of power, Intel Core i5 processors are your best bet, as they offer good performance at a decent price. Basic office and web work gets along just fine on a Core i3, however. A Core i7 is more suited to gaming and more intense work than everyday tasks.</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: You&rsquo;ll want a discrete graphics card for hardcore gaming or editing videos. It&rsquo;s separate from the processor, so you can expect higher performance out of it. Integrated graphics, on the other hand, are attached to the CPU and uses less power as a result. This is perfectly fine for everyday tasks, especially if you&rsquo;re not doing anything that&rsquo;s graphics-intensive.</li>



<li><strong>Display size:</strong> If you&rsquo;re a video editor or someone who does a lot of multimedia work, you&rsquo;ll want a display that&rsquo;s anywhere from 15- to 17-inches. The sweet spot is really anywhere from 13- to 14-inches, though. The bigger the display, the heavier your laptop is going to be. A 13- or 14-inch display is the best in terms of portability and value.</li>



<li><strong>Battery life:</strong> If you plan on taking your laptop anywhere with you, aim for something that can last 10 to 12 hours on a single charge. That&rsquo;s more than a full work day, so it should theoretically get you through long flights or a day of classes. Obviously, more is always better. Just know that the bigger the battery, the heavier the laptop. Read our round-up of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1915376/best-laptop-usb-c-pd-chargers.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">best laptop chargers</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Price:</strong> The price really depends on your budget. If you&rsquo;re strapped for cash (been there, trust me), go for a Chromebook or an entry-level business laptop. These laptops are good choices for students or young professionals. If you can afford to spend more, the versatility of a 2-in-1 laptop is really worth it. </li>



<li><strong>Ports</strong>: A wide array of ports is always a plus in my book, as it eliminates the need for an adapter. I&rsquo;d recommend a laptop that has both USB-C and USB-A. An HDMI port is good, too. This is especially useful for when you want to hook up to an external monitor.</li>

## PWM vs. DC: Which fan is better for PC cooling?

<p>Deciding between PWM and DC case fans can be confusing, but it&rsquo;s important for the optimal performance of your computer. </p>



<p>In general, PWM fans are quieter, more controllable, and more durable than DC fans. However, if you have a limited budget or are building a PC where constant fan speeds are necessary, DC fans work just as well as PWM fans. We&rsquo;ll explain what all that means, and the key differences between the two fan types below.</p>

</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-dc-case-fans-work">How DC case fans work</h2>



<p>A DC fan is a computer fan that is operated with direct current from the PC power supply or via your motherboard. This type of fan uses a three-pin connector with a supply pin as well as a ground pin and a signal output.</p>



<p>The first two pins supply power, while the signal output reads information about the speed of the fan blades (it&rsquo;s often referred to as the tachometer pin). This allows your PC to monitor fan speeds and warn you when a fan stops running. </p>



<p>DC fans can run either at a constant speed or at a changing speed. The motherboard takes over the control. At lower speeds, the motherboard sends less voltage to the fan. The typical voltage for DC fans is 12 volts, but there are also models with voltages ranging from 5 to 48 volts. </p>

</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Noctua</p></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-pwm-case-fans-work">How PWM case fans work</h2>



<p>A PWM fan is essentially a DC fan with an additional pin, but one that fundamentally changes the way the fan works. This fourth pin transmits what is known as a pulse width modulation (PWM) signal, which switches the fan on and off quickly.</p>



<p>While DC fans use different currents to control the fan speeds, PWM models only use a constant voltage, usually 12 volts. To control the speed of the fan, the PWM signal turns the fan on and off several thousand times per second. This may not sound efficient. However, PWM fans offer much more precise control over the exact speed of the fan.</p>



<p>As mentioned above, both DC and PWM fans can vary their speed. However, a PWM fan can be controlled more precisely. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="pwm-vs-dc-case-fans">PWM vs. DC case fans</h2>



<p>Significant differences between the two types of fans lie less in their performance than in their mode of operation: DC fans have a minimum speed. If the voltage is too low, this type of fan can stall. With PWM fans, on the other hand, the voltage remains constant because PWM directly controls the fan motor. Here you don&rsquo;t need to worry about a stop.</p>



<p>This also means that PWM fans can generally spin slower than their DC counterparts. If a computer does not need much cooling, the slower spinning of the fans results in less noise. So overall, PWM fans are quieter than DC fans. Because they can spin down more easily, PWM fans also generally wear out less. Of course, this varies depending on the manufacturer and the application, but PWM fans usually last longer than DC variants. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="DC-L&uuml;fter" class="wp-image-1977199" height="743" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/pcw07_Pins.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>When looking for suitable fans, the motherboard plays an important role: DC fans require three pins. PWM fans require four available pins.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">EKWB</p></div>



<p>Another area where the varying voltage of DC fans is problematic is the aforementioned noise levels. DC fans operating at less than their normal voltage of 12 volts produce electrical noise. If you use your computer for audio production, this noise can be a big problem. </p>



<p>So which type of fan is better? Despite the clear advantages of PWM fans, DC fans are included in most pre-built PCs.  Even cases with integrated fans usually use DC fans instead of PWM. This is mainly due to cost, as DC fans are cheaper. However, DC fans are not just the cheaper option. If you are building a PC that has a regular workload, constant speed DC fans provide sufficient cooling performance as well as a relatively long life. </p>



<p>For those seeking as much control over the PC as possible, PWM is generally the way to go. Although you have to invest a little more, you save in the long run thanks to the long life of PWM fans. They are also the better choice for quiet PC configurations. </p>



<p>Nevertheless, you can only use the respective fan type if your PC&rsquo;s motherboard offers the appropriate connections. Therefore, always keep an eye on your motherboard&rsquo;s connections to make sure you buy the right fan for your computer.</p>

## Why you should always set up guest Wi-Fi at home

<p>You can take all the usual steps to safeguard your home network&mdash;change the administrator password, set up a strong and unique password for Wi-Fi access, bump the encryption protocol to WPA2 or WPA3. But if you don&rsquo;t set up guest Wi-Fi, you&rsquo;re not doing everything you can to protect your security and privacy.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Need help selecting the right password manager? Check out PCWorld&rsquo;s roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407092/best-password-managers-reviews-and-buying-advice.html">best password managers</a> available today.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2016863/canon-printers-may-keep-your-wi-fi-info-even-after-a-reset.html">recent issue with Canon printers</a> highlights why using guest Wi-Fi (even if you never have anyone over) can be helpful. In this instance, when you reset the printer to factory defaults, the information doesn&rsquo;t actually get cleared due to a bug in the software. That means that stored details like your Wi-Fi password sticks around, allowing someone else to see your private data. In theory, someone could then hop on to your network.</p>



<p>Now, a printer usually would be on your normal network with all your other devices; your PC needs to be able to see it for wireless printing to work. But for gear that doesn&rsquo;t need to be found by your PC&mdash;or for an actual guest whose security practices you have no control over&mdash;a guest Wi-Fi network can limit the potential damage of weak security related to those devices. Your home network might be protected by a good password, but if someone else has that info, it won&rsquo;t do you any good. Once logged in, they can snoop around and see the flow of network traffic (e.g., what sites you visit), peruse the contents of any attached network storage, and introduce malware into the network.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage center"><figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="TP-Link Deco app guest wi-fi interface" class="wp-image-2018209" height="599" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_3046.png?w=554" width="277" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Setting up a guest network is simple and fast. It usually doesn&rsquo;t involve many settings to configure.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>Since you can&rsquo;t trust that all gadgets you own (or that your friends and family bring over) are secure and respecting your privacy, segregating the less trustworthy or important devices is a useful precaution. That&rsquo;s where your guest Wi-Fi comes in. All but the oldest routers let you set it up and once you do, it&rsquo;s where you should put strange gear that demand internet connections (like random IoT devices).</p>



<p>Key differences exist between logging on to your network with the normal password or through a guest login. For starters, anyone on the guest Wi-Fi shouldn&rsquo;t be able to see the traffic on your home network&mdash;typically, they use different IP address ranges. You can sometimes also program the guest Wi-Fi to only be available at certain times of the day or have it deactivate when no devices are connected.</p>



<p>You should still treat the guest Wi-Fi with the same consideration as your normal home network&mdash;that is, securing it with a good, unique password. If you&rsquo;re given the ability to configure the security protocol, it should be set to WPA2 or WPA3. It&rsquo;s not advisable to leave it open for anyone to use, since you can never be sure your router won&rsquo;t end up having an exploitable vulnerability. When you&rsquo;ve <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2002677/6-bigt-wi-fi-mistakes-and-their-solutions.html">already taken other steps</a> to get your home network in tip-top shape, you don&rsquo;t want to undermine your hard work.</p>

## Oops! Microsoft accidentally posts tool that unlocks secret Windows 11 features

<p>Psst. Hey, you. Yeah, you. You wanna try out some of the latest Windows 11 features? The ones even Microsoft doesn&rsquo;t want hundreds of millions of users to have access to yet? Well, all you gotta do is tiptoe down one of the slightly less-reputable alleys of the internet and download this here tool. Don&rsquo;t worry, this one fell off a truck coming right out of Microsoft HQ, it&rsquo;s legit. Install it, run a couple of command lines, and you can skip right past the Windows Insider program A/B test and get the <em>good stuff</em>. </p>



<p>Yesterday Microsoft posted some instructions for <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/08/02/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-23516/&amp;xcust=2-1-2018622-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">its Bug Bash program</a>, a periodic event where it encourages developers and Windows super-fans to track down bugs in the latest Windows Insider builds and report them. But these instructions included a download link for an internal Microsoft developer tool, quickly spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/XenoPanther/status/1686712381840179200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1686712381840179200%7Ctwgr%5Eb961e56ade1af0443ebb51761d242538773982bf%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2023%2F8%2F3%2F23818363%2Fmicrosoft-windows-11-stagingtool-leak-secret-features&amp;xcust=2-1-2018622-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">users like @XenoPanther</a>. The StagingTool executable can be used in the command line to enable and disable hidden features in Insider builds that aren&rsquo;t normally visible, possibly bypassing the semi-random A/B testing that the most eager Windows preview users can find frustrating. </p>



<p>The links to StagingTool.exe were removed from public view in less than a day, but Windows Insider fans quickly distributed the program and are currently having a ball dissecting everything it can do. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/3/23818363/microsoft-windows-11-stagingtool-leak-secret-features&amp;xcust=2-1-2018622-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">As The Verge notes</a>, this isn&rsquo;t the only way to manually flip the hidden switches in Windows; user-created tools have enabled this sort of thing before. But this is undoubtedly one of the biggest &mdash; and possibly most embarrassing &mdash; leaks to come directly from Microsoft in a while. </p>



<p>You can find the tool in various Windows groups and forums now (but be sure to exercise the usual caution in downloading unverified executables!). As engineering tools go, StagingTool.exe is fairly straightforward, allowing you to enable or disable various options and modes in Insider builds with text commands. Since the tool comes directly (albeit mistakenly) from Microsoft, tinkerers are having a blast trying out the various options with more confidence than usual. But as with all experimental features, proceed at your own risk if you want to try it out for yourself. </p>

Other aspects, though, take a slight step back.</p>
</div>


<p>We weren&rsquo;t sure how much the OBSBOT Tiny 2 PTZ 4K Webcam would improve over its predecessor. An improved image sensor and some unexpected AI voice controls and beauty enhancements, though, help justify the extremely high price.</p>



<p>At an MSRP of $329, the OBSBOT Tiny 2 is arguably 10 times the price of some budget cameras in our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393756/1080p-4k-webcam-buying-guide.html">roundup of the best webcams</a>. But the difference in image quality and features is momentous, barring a small change to the Tiny 2&rsquo;s physical design that we&rsquo;re not totally pleased with. OBSBOT is also selling what it calls the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.obsbot.com/store/products/remote-controller-for-tiny2&amp;xcust=2-1-2013947-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Tiny Remote Control</a> ($49) as well as an <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.obsbot.com/store/products/extendable-desktop-tripod?product_id=0081a73c1e0f4&amp;xcust=2-1-2013947-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">extendable tripod</a> ($49.99, with a ball head for $13.90 more) that extends to about 30 inches.</p>



<p>On a basic level, OBSBOT increased the image quality with a 1/1.5-inch 50Mpixel CMOS image sensor. OSBBOT also improved the focus time and built in two ISO settings: one that will kick in when your face is overexposed, and one for darkened rooms. All of these enhancements are designed to show off your face the best it can, with realistic color in multiple lighting conditions. A recent update added HDR capabilities, though, which we&rsquo;d say need some more work.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="still-as-tiny-as-ever">Still as Tiny as ever</h2>



<p>Having reviewed the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1935922/obsbot-tiny-4k-webcam-review.html">OBSBOT Tiny PTZ 4K webcam</a> (about $90 less at press time) on the same PC, I found that I had to download the updated application manually before the software would recognize that the Tiny 2 had been installed. The OSBBOT Tiny app then asked to download Tiny 2-specific firmware, which took several minutes to install.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="OBSBOT Tiny 2 PTZ 4K webcam" class="wp-image-2014064" height="852" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/OBSBot-Tiny-2-lean-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The Tiny 2 looks decidedly  earnest when attached to a monitor, a bit like a Pixar robot.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>The Tiny 2 is indeed tiny, measuring 1.85 x 2.52 x 1.73 inches and weighing 5 ounces. It ships in a small zipped pouch for safekeeping.</p>



<p>The Tiny 2&rsquo;s construction seems like a slight step down from the prior generation. A short USB-C to USB-C cable, about 3 feet, connects the camera to your PC. The camera itself magnetically attaches to a base, held on by a metal frame with an overhanging &ldquo;jaw&rdquo; that helps hold it in place. It&rsquo;s a simpler construction than the Tiny 1, and less secure on older, thicker displays as well as traditional laptops.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="OBSBOT Tiny 2 PTZ 4K webcam" class="wp-image-2014062" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/OBSBOT-Tiny-2-lean-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Viewed from the side, though, the OBSBOT Tiny 2 looks a bit more precarious.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-is-the-tiny-2-webcams-video-gorgeous">How is the Tiny 2 webcam&rsquo;s video? Gorgeous</h2>



<p>Like the first-gen Tiny webcam, you have a few video modes to choose from, from 720p at 30Hz (720p30) to 1080p30 or 1080p60, on up to 4K30. The 1080p60 setting reproduces the smooth motion you&rsquo;d see on TVs, while the 4K setting makes your details pop. Either looks great in terms of capturing pre-recorded video, but you&rsquo;ll also stand out on Teams or Zoom calls if those codecs support the Tiny webcam&rsquo;s video formats.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s a credit to the Tiny 2 that we haven&rsquo;t even mentioned OBSBOT&rsquo;s selling point until now: an independent gimbal that allows the camera to pivot and pan to keep you centered. The Tiny 2 adds zoom to this as well, a feature that some webcams assisted by Microsoft&rsquo;s Windows Studio Effects have also used. </p>



<p>You won&rsquo;t notice this in your normal Zoom call&mdash;and, to be fair, some people prefer a fixed webcam that doesn&rsquo;t follow them if they lean down to pet their dog. But if you like to walk around, or you&rsquo;re making a presentation in a physical workspace, a webcam that follows you around might be appreciated. The OBSBOT Tiny 2 PTZ 4K does seem like it has a bit more trouble tracking your face than the earlier generation, however. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The value of the OBSBOT Tiny 2 boils down to the improved sensor, slightly better configuration and zoom options, and the convenient but slightly worrying voice commands.</p></blockquote></figure>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img alt="OBSBOT Tiny 2 PTZ 4K webcam" class="wp-image-2014065" height="797" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/OBSBOT-Tiny-2-basement.png?w=1200" width="1199" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The OBSBOT Tiny 2 4K, shooting an image in my downstairs, dimly lit office, primarily lit by a single widescreen display.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>An enormously significant part of the Tiny lineup&rsquo;s value is its software, which on the Tiny 1 was nearly perfect: simple, efficient, and straightforward. With the Tiny 2, the addition of new features has muddled everything just a bit. For example, the Tiny 2&rsquo;s &ldquo;human tracking&rdquo; features offer both &ldquo;standard&rdquo; but also &ldquo;motion&rdquo; tracking, as well as &ldquo;normal tracking&rdquo; and the ability to focus on you as a &ldquo;closeup&rdquo; or your &ldquo;upper body&rdquo; but also &ldquo;headless&rdquo; (!) as well as &ldquo;lower body&rdquo; (?!!) modes. It can even zoom in on your desk (okay) as well as track your hand. </p>



<p>You&rsquo;ll need to experiment a bit, or just default to the standard modes. Like before, the Tiny 2 effortlessly slides between wide, medium, and narrow fields of view.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="OBSBOT Tiny 2 PTZ 4K webcam" class="wp-image-2014066" height="737" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/OBSBOT-Tiny-2-upstairs-2.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Upstairs, with more natural side light.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-tiny-2s-voice-commands-and-beauty-features-are-just-okay">The Tiny 2&rsquo;s voice commands and beauty features are just okay</h2>



<p>One quirk of the Tiny 1 was a hand gesture that signaled the webcam to focus on your face. While that optional gesture still remains, now you can tell the webcam to wake up (&ldquo;Hi, Tiny&rdquo;) and &ldquo;track me&rdquo; or &ldquo;unlock me&rdquo; instead. </p>



<p>The worrying thing in all this that &ldquo;Hi Tiny&rdquo; is <em>not</em> a traditional wake word, like a smart speaker. You can spontaneously say &ldquo;unlock me,&rdquo; and the camera will stop tracking you. You may find that a little creepy, since the webcam is essentially always listening. (Other commands include &ldquo;zoom in closer,&rdquo; &ldquo;zoom out further,&rdquo; and &ldquo;position [one/two/three]&rdquo; with preconfigured &ldquo;macros&rdquo; or situations.</p>



<p>Otherwise, though, the mic in the Tiny 2 is very good, and captured my voice very well both near and far, even with a fan running in the background. (The Tiny 2 times out after two minutes of inactivity, pointing at the ground, and the default setting is to turn off the mic as it does so.)</p>



<p>The other feature that OBSBOT added to the Tiny 2 PTZ 4K is a set of AI beauty enhancements. Some of these look similar to features hidden in the Samsung Galaxy Book software, where the AI will give your lips a subtle pink hue. A man-specific setting narrows an otherwise round face.</p>



<p>The real eyebrow raiser, though, are <em>body</em> settings: sliders to enhance or decrease the size of your head, shoulders, waist, and more. Want to look &ldquo;leggy&rdquo;? Dial up the slider. Want to slim down? A slider does that too. </p>



<p>Don&rsquo;t bother, though, as the AI enhancements don&rsquo;t really work well enough to fool anyone, and a narrow waist means two different things on a female and male figure. Maybe it was a glitch, but a brief glimpse of myself with a waist that tapered to inside my hips was more than enough for me. Even worse, turning on the beauty options on our test laptop (at 4K settings) introduced enormous lag, bringing the video quality down to a crawl. The Tiny 2 also got hot to the touch under load.</p>



<p>For us, then, the value of the OBSBOT Tiny 2 boils down to the improved sensor, slightly better configuration and zoom options, and the convenient but slightly worrying voice commands. That&rsquo;s enough to justify buying an OBSBOT Tiny 2 PTZ 4K Webcam, even though some of its added features aren&rsquo;t worth as much as OBSBOT believes.</p>

But why stop at two displays?&nbsp; I can speak from experience: Having multiple monitors (and I&rsquo;m talking three, four, five, or even six) is just&hellip;awesome, and something you totally need in your life.</p>



<p>Right now, my main PC has a triple-monitor setup: my main 27-inch central monitor, with a 24-inch monitor on either side. I use my extra monitors for a number of things, such as comparing spreadsheets side-by-side, writing articles while also doing research, keeping tabs on my social media feeds, and, of course, watching Netflix.</p>



<p>Using one of your monitors in vertical orientation can make a big difference for scrolling long documents. If you&rsquo;re a gamer, well, surely you can see how great three-plus monitors can be for games that support multi-monitor setups. You can even <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2924203/use-your-tv-as-a-computer-monitor-everything-you-need-to-know.html">use your TV as an extra computer monitor</a>!</p>



<p>But before you jump in, you want to give your multi-monitor plan some forethought. This guide will walk you through all the factors you need to take into account before setting up three or more monitors.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="step-1-check-your-graphics-cards">Step 1: Check your graphics card(s)</h2>



<p>Before you run out and buy a bunch of extra monitors, check to see whether your computer is physically capable of handling all that graphics prowess. First, look at the back of your PC: How many graphics ports (usually HDMI and DisplayPort, but sometimes DVI and VGA on older hardware) do you see?</p>



<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a discrete graphics card, you may only see&nbsp;up to two video ports, if you see any at all. Many motherboards come with integrated graphics that can only run one or two monitor setups, while many other motherboards lack outgoing video ports whatsoever. If you <em>do</em> have a discrete graphics card, you&rsquo;ll probably see at least three ports, not including the ports on your motherboard.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>Tip</strong>: While it is possible to set up multiple monitors using ports on both your motherboard and your discrete graphics card, you&rsquo;ll see a performance drop and some lag when you move windows between monitors. If you want to do this, you will also need to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/477065/how-to-enter-your-pcs-bios.html">enter your PC&rsquo;s BIOS</a> and go to <em>Configuration &gt; Video &gt; Integrated graphics device</em> and set it to &ldquo;Always enable.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Just because you see three or more ports on your discrete graphics card, however, doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean you can use all of them at the same time. For example, many older Nvidia cards are unable to run more than two monitors on a single card, even if they have more than two ports. The best way to find out whether your graphics card supports multiple monitors is to find the name of your card (<em>Control Panel &gt; Device Manager &gt; Display Adapters</em>) and Google it with the monitor setup you&rsquo;re looking to run (e.g. &ldquo;Nvidia GTX 1060 four monitors&rdquo;).</p>

<p>If your graphics card supports&mdash;and has enough ports for&mdash;the number of monitors you want to set up, excellent. If not, you may need to purchase an additional graphics card to get the multi-monitor support you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>



<p>Before you buy an extra graphics card, you&rsquo;ll need to make sure you have enough space in your tower (and open PCIe slots), as well as a power supply unit that can handle the extra strain.</p>



<p>If you buy a graphics card solely for the purpose of having multiple monitors, it&rsquo;s best to get a cheaper modern option, as current GPUs can power several displays without issue. Check out our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/416006/the-best-graphics-cards-for-pc-gaming.html">roundup of the best graphics cards</a> for your best options. (At the time of writing, our favorite budget graphics card is the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/543823/amd-radeon-rx-6600-review-finally-a-true-1080p-graphics-card.html">AMD Radeon RX 6600</a> and it supports up to four monitors.)</p>



<p>Alternatively, monitors with  DisplayPort multi-streaming support&nbsp;can be daisy-chained together from a single DisplayPort connection on your graphics card, using additional DisplayPort cables to connect the additional monitors to one another. The various displays don&rsquo;t even need to be the same size or resolution. Finding monitors with a DisplayPort output can be difficult these days, however, even with higher-end displays.</p>

<p>Once you figure out your graphics card situation, it&rsquo;s time for the fun part: obtaining extra monitors. In general, 1080p monitors can be had for fairly cheap these days. Assuming you can&rsquo;t finagle a hand-me-down, a 24-inch monitor with an IPS screen will run you around $150, such as the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/631916/acer-k242hyl-review.html">Acer K242HYL</a>&mdash;our favorite budget 1080p display&mdash;shown above.</p>

<p>Even pixel-packed 4K displays have come down in price in recent years, with the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/803583/asus-tuf-gaming-vg289q-review.html">Asus TUF Gaming VG289Q</a>&mdash;our favorite budget 4K gaming monitor&mdash;costing under $300 as well. If you&rsquo;re feeling fancy, you can opt for more premium models with features like USB-C power delivery and OLED displays, or have a drool-inducing ultrawide monitor be the eye-catching center of your insane multi-monitor setup.</p>



<p>Of course, the perfect monitor for you depends on multiple factors, including the monitors you already have, the size of your desk, the resolution(s) you want, and what you&rsquo;re planning on using your extra monitor for. We maintain several monitor roundups that can help you find the best option for your situation:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/811315/best-monitors-2.html">The best monitors</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/813301/best-gaming-monitors.html">The best gaming monitors</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1470449/best-ultrawide-monitors.html">The best ultrawide monitors</a></li>
</ul>



<p>In my case, I already had two 24-inch monitors, and I wanted a larger monitor as the centerpiece of my setup, so I picked up a 27-inch monitor and placed it between my two 24-inch displays. I&rsquo;m not using my multi-monitor setup to play multi-monitor games, so the difference in sizes (and the difference in heights&mdash;my 27-inch monitor&rsquo;s stand holds that monitor about one inch higher than my 24-inchers) isn&rsquo;t an issue for me. However, if you&rsquo;re planning on doing a lot of gaming or watching videos that span multiple monitors, this height difference will make for a not-so-seamless experience.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image large"><img alt="" src="https://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/03/displayvshdmi_primary-100028825-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">
<p>A DisplayPort connector (left) and an HDMI cable (right).</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p>Before you buy your monitors, you&rsquo;ll also want to make sure they have input ports that correspond with your PC&rsquo;s output ports. While you could use conversion cables, such as DVI-to-HDMI or DisplayPort-to-DVI, they can be a hassle. If you have a VGA port on your PC or your monitor, I suggest staying away from it: VGA is an analog connector, which means your picture will be noticeably less sharp and colors will be less vivid.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="step-3-set-up-your-pc">Step 3: Set up your PC</h2>



<p>Set up your monitors, plug them in, and turn on your PC. <em>Voila</em>! A perfectly formed multi-monitor setup! Well, not so fast. Setup is easy, but there are still a couple more steps.</p>



<p>The first thing you&rsquo;ll want to do is configure Windows to play nicely with your multiple monitors. If you&rsquo;re running Windows 7 or Windows 8, right-click on the desktop and click <em>Screen resolution; </em>in Windows 10 or 11, click <em>Display settings</em>. This will take you to a screen where you can configure the options you have for multiple monitors in Windows.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image large"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.techhive.com/images/article/2015/05/multiple-monitors-windows-screen-resolution-100586030-orig.jpg"><img alt="multiple monitors windows screen resolution" src="https://images.techhive.com/images/article/2015/05/multiple-monitors-windows-screen-resolution-100586030-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a></figure></div>




<p>Here, you can confirm that all your monitors are detected. Click <em>Identify</em>, which will cause a large number to appear on each of your displays, so you can determine which screen is which. Select the monitor you&rsquo;d like to serve as your main display (which will also determine where your taskbar and Start button appears). A drop-down menu lets you choose whether to duplicate your desktop or extend your desktop across all the screens. In most multi-monitor setups, you&rsquo;ll want to extend your desktop across all three (or four, or whatever) of your displays.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image medium right"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.techhive.com/images/article/2015/05/nvidia-sarah-multiple-displays-100586026-orig.png"><img alt="nvidia sarah multiple displays" src="https://images.techhive.com/images/article/2015/05/nvidia-sarah-multiple-displays-100586026-medium.png?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a></figure></div>




<p>Alternately, you can set up your multi-monitor configuration in your GPU&rsquo;s control panel. Right-click your desktop and choose&nbsp;either the Nvidia or AMD control panel (depending on your graphics card), and find the Display section, which will offer similar options as Windows.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="gaming">Gaming</h2>



<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to use multiple monitors to do work and watch Netflix. It&rsquo;s another thing entirely to use multiple monitors to play video games. If you want to use your snazzy new multi-monitor setup to do some three- or four-panel gaming, there are a few extra things you&rsquo;ll have to take into consideration.</p>



<p>Gaming on several displays at once requires far more graphical firepower than gaming on a single screen alone, because the GPU has so many more pixels to push&mdash;so if you&rsquo;re not running a sufficiently robust graphics card or cards, you&rsquo;ll almost certainly see lag and artifacting in your multi-monitor games. Once again, check out <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3106426/components-graphics/the-best-graphics-cards-for-pc-gaming.html">PCWorld&rsquo;s guide for choosing the best graphics card for gaming</a>.</p>

<p>GLORIOUS.</p>

<p>Before you can start playing your games across multiple panels, you&rsquo;ll need to set up your graphics card and your game. Nvidia users will need to set up Nvidia Surround, while AMD users will need to create an Eyefinity group for their monitors.</p>



<p>You&rsquo;ll also need to go into your game&mdash;not all games are multi-monitor compatible&mdash;and configure the video or display settings to the correct resolution so that the game spans across all of your monitors instead of staying squished on just one. You&rsquo;ll also want to play around with other settings as the game allows, including field of view (too low, and there will be too much going on around you; too high and everything on your left and right screens will be hugely distorted).</p>

<p>For gaming, it&rsquo;s easier if you have multiple identical displays, because otherwise you&rsquo;ll run into issues with resolution, distortion (if your displays aren&rsquo;t at the same height), and color calibration, all of which can be difficult to work with if you&rsquo;re trying to play in a &ldquo;seamless&rdquo; environment.</p>



<p>If working with multiple displays seems like more trouble than you want to bother with for gaming, maybe you&rsquo;d be better off with a single ultrawide monitor. Check out our article on the pros and cons of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/395110/ultrawide-vs-dual-monitors.html">dual displays versus a single ultrawide</a>, as well as our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1439692/best-ultrawide-gaming-monitors.html">best ultrawide gaming monitors</a>.</p>

<p>Microsoft has made a big deal about the increased security in Windows 11. According to Microsoft, the surprisingly high system requirements that  prevented many users with even fairly new computers from installing the Windows 11 are mainly due to security features. So what&rsquo;s the deal and how can you make sure you benefit from it?</p>



<p>In this article, we provide the answers and show you how to better protect your privacy &mdash; both from Microsoft and others. The more our lives are lived digitally, the more important it is.</p>

<p>Many of Windows 11&rsquo;s system requirements relate to security features that have been around for years in Windows 10 but few outside of corporate IT departments paid attention to. Some of these won&rsquo;t turn on automatically if you update from Windows 10, but will be enabled on all new computers sold directly with Windows 11. Some are very sensible and don&rsquo;t affect your computer&rsquo;s performance at all, while others can have a negative impact and we&rsquo;ll show you below how to turn them off if you value performance more.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="secure-boot-and-tpm">Secure Boot and TPM</h2>



<p>To install Windows 11 on your PC at all, it needs a modern processor (Intel 8th-generation or AMD Ryzen 3000 or newer) and two security features: <em><strong>Secure Boot</strong></em> and a so-called <em><strong>trusted platform module (TPM)</strong></em>.</p>



<p>Secure Boot has been around for many years, but most PC users haven&rsquo;t had it running because it hasn&rsquo;t been compulsory, and mostly felt like an unnecessary hassle. The feature is part of UEFI, the modern replacement for BIOS. It allows the computer&rsquo;s basic software to detect &mdash; and stop &mdash; a modified operating system by checking its cryptographic signatures.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Enabling Secure Boot effectively stops sneaky malware that, for example, installs itself under Windows as a so-called bootkit and can covertly read everything that happens on the system. You enable Secure Boot in your computer&rsquo;s BIOS settings, but activating it is not actually a requirement for installing or running Windows 11 &mdash; the requirement is for the computer to be <em>able</em> to use Secure Boot.</p>



<p>TPM, on the other hand, is a requirement for installing and running the new system. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/395062/microsoft-backs-down-older-pcs-will-be-able-to-run-windows-11.html">There are ways around it</a>, but Microsoft warns that you may miss out on future updates and it&rsquo;s unlikely that the TPM requirement is the only thing preventing you from installing Windows 11 as almost all Intel and AMD processors from 2013 onwards have a built-in TPM module.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Windows settings screenshot" class="wp-image-2012185" height="741" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/windows-device-manager-tpm.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>



<p>Unlike Secure Boot, whose benefits are a bit more esoteric, it&rsquo;s clearer why TPM is a great idea. The basic functions of TPM are the secure storage of encryption keys, certificates and the like, and the secure creation and control of new keys. For example, it could be the encryption key for Bitlocker that secures all data on your hard drive, or the encryption key used with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394379/windows-hello-webcams-you-can-buy-right-now.html">Windows Hello for quick login with PIN or facial recognition</a>. Third-party applications like Firefox and Chrome also use TPM if it&rsquo;s present, even in Windows 10.</p>



<p>This works much like Apple&rsquo;s &ldquo;secure enclave&rdquo; that has protected the iPhone and iPad for many years, and similar features in mobile processors from Qualcomm, Samsung and other manufacturers.</p>



<p>With a TPM enabled, Windows and individual programs that need to generate encryption keys can ask the TPM to do so. The generated keys are only stored there and can never be extracted or copied to other locations. This is much more secure than when keys are generated by the regular processor because a Trojan or other malware could theoretically intercept such keys.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows settings screenshot" class="wp-image-2012186" height="814" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/windows-sign-in-options.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>



<p>A good example of how TPM protects you is Windows Hello. In Windows 11, Microsoft recommends that you use a Microsoft account and turn off sign-in with the account password so that you can only sign in with Windows Hello &mdash; normally a PIN, but you could also use facial recognition or a fingerprint scanner.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say you are hit by a malware with a keylogger that captures everything you type on your keyboard. This includes your PIN, but because the PIN is linked to an encryption key on this particular computer, the malware creators will not be able to log in to your Microsoft account on another machine. If you had logged in with your account password instead, you would have been left with only two-factor authentication to protect you from a hacked account.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="virtualisation-based-security">Virtualisation-based security</h2>



<p>The hardware requirement that is really behind Windows 11 requiring such a new computer is something called <em><strong>virtualization-based security</strong></em> or <em><strong>VBS</strong></em>. This means that the system uses the ability of modern processors to run code in virtual machines with their own separate parts of working memory.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Virtualization was first used to run other operating systems inside Windows or another system so that you can, for example, test software or run a program that doesn&rsquo;t work on your regular system. A common example is Mac users running Windows with a virtual machine to access Windows-specific programs.</p>



<p>Virtualization-based security uses the same techniques to separate certain parts of Windows so that other parts of the system cannot access them. It consists of several different components, some of which are only available in the enterprise versions of Windows and not in the Home version.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="memory-integrity">Memory integrity</h3>



<p>Open <em><strong>Windows Security</strong></em> and select <em><strong>Device Security</strong></em>. If VBS is active, you will see a green tick next to <em><strong>Core isolation</strong></em> and it says &ldquo;virtualization-based security protects the core parts of your device.&rdquo; Click on the <em><strong>Core isolation information</strong></em> and you&rsquo;ll be taken to a submenu where you can enable or disable something called <em><strong>Memory Integrity</strong></em> (the technology behind it is called &ldquo;hypervisor-enforced code integrity&rdquo; or HVCI).</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows settings screenshot" class="wp-image-2012188" height="769" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/windows-core-isolation.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>



<p>This is one of the features VBS enables, which means that Windows places sensitive code in a virtual machine that the rest of the system cannot access, even with admin permissions. This increases security and provides better protection against some malware, but can also lead to lower performance &mdash; up to 25 percent less on some machines. Because of this, gamers or people who use their computer for intensive work often choose to disable the feature despite its security benefits.</p>



<p>If you have updated from Windows 10, Memory Integrity is not enabled by default. On new computers that come with the system, it is. If you are experiencing performance issues with your computer, check if the feature is active and try turning it off. If you don&rsquo;t have a problem with it, it is of course best to keep it active so that your computer is as protected as possible.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="privacy-protection-microsoft-has-improved">Privacy protection &ndash; Microsoft has improved</h2>



<p>One of the things Microsoft was most criticised for after the launch of Windows 10 is how the system sends analytics data to the company and how difficult it is to turn off this sharing, as well as how the Start menu was full of ads.</p>



<p>In Windows 11, Microsoft has listened to the criticism and the settings for privacy protection and user data sharing have been significantly improved. The settings for both Windows itself and the authorization of third-party applications to access features such as the camera and your image library are located in <em><strong>Settings -&gt; Privacy &amp; Security</strong></em>. Here&rsquo;s how to use them and turn off any sharing you don&rsquo;t want.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows settings screenshot" class="wp-image-2012181" height="887" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/windows-privacy-and-security.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>



<p>The settings panel has three major sections: <em><strong>Security</strong></em>, <em><strong>Windows Permissions</strong></em>, and <em><strong>App permissions</strong></em>. Security is mostly shortcuts to the separate program Windows Security, so it&rsquo;s the other two that you will use the most.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="windows-permissions">Windows permissions</h3>



<p><em><strong>General</strong></em> has the important setting for Advertising ID, the unique code that, if you allow it, can be used to track you, so that advertising buyers can, for example, trace a purchase of a product to an advertising banner you clicked on. If you don&rsquo;t like adverts in your system, turn this off.</p>



<p><em><strong>Inking and typing personalization</strong></em>: If you use a pen and sometimes write directly on the screen, this setting lets you decide whether Windows should create a customized dictionary for you.</p>



<p><em><strong>Speech</strong></em> controls whether you want to use Microsoft&rsquo;s more advanced online speech recognition, which of course sends what you say to Microsoft&rsquo;s servers. If you switch it off, you&rsquo;ll have to make do with the less advanced speech recognition directly on your computer.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows settings screenshot" class="wp-image-2012189" height="908" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/windows-diagnostics.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>



<p><em><strong>Diagnostics &amp; Feedback</strong></em>: Here are settings for how your use of the computer can be used for analytical purposes. The data is anonymized and is intended to help Microsoft improve Windows and other products. The system always sends &ldquo;required data&rdquo; but you can choose to send additional data, which is a requirement if you want to connect your computer to the Windows Insider program. An important feature here is Delete Diagnostic Data. If you have had diagnostic data sharing switched on and have now turned it off, it may be a good idea to delete all data already collected.</p>



<p><em><strong>Activity history</strong></em> is a feature of your Microsoft account that allows you to continue what you have done on one device while sitting at another that is logged in to the same account. Switch it off if you only have one computer, as it is completely unnecessary if so.</p>



<p><em><strong>Search permissions</strong></em>: There are two important settings here: Whether you want filtering for adult content in the Windows search function, and whether you want to save your search history so you can find things you&rsquo;ve previously searched for more quickly.</p>



<p><em><strong>Search in Windows</strong></em> has other settings for the search function that we don&rsquo;t really think belong in the privacy settings, such as which folders should not be searched. If you&rsquo;re wondering why it&rsquo;s not under System in Settings, we don&rsquo;t have an answer, but this is where you can set Windows Search to look for files outside your home folder.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="app-permissions">App permissions</h3>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows settings screenshot" class="wp-image-2012182" height="929" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/windows-locatoin.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>



<p>There are a number of sub-sections for everything on your computer that relates to privacy matters. The most important ones are conveniently located at the top of the app permissions section: <em><strong>Location</strong></em>, which deals with whether Windows and applications can find out where you are, <em><strong>Camera</strong></em> and <em><strong>Microphone</strong></em> which are pretty obvious, and features like <em><strong>voice activation</strong></em>, <em><strong>messages</strong></em> (notifications) and <em><strong>account information</strong></em>.</p>



<p>Under Camera and Microphone, you can easily turn off or on access to individual applications. We recommend being sparing in granting access and switching off both for the applications you no longer use. The fewer programs that have access, the better.</p>



<p>Location data is not nearly as useful on a computer as it is on a mobile phone. For many users, the only benefit of having Windows read your location is that online stores can more easily display your nearest physical store, and web searches for shops, restaurants, and the like can instantly display results from your neighborhood. If that&rsquo;s not something that appeals to you, we recommend switching off location tracking altogether.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="other-settings-you-may-want-to-change">Other settings you may want to change</h1>



<p>In addition to the settings in Privacy and Security, there are a bunch of other things related to what Microsoft knows about you that you may also want to change.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="dont-tell-me-about-your-habits">Don&rsquo;t tell me about your habits</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows settings screenshot" class="wp-image-2012187" height="791" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/windows-device-usage.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>



<p>Microsoft wants to know how you use Windows. The feature is called Device Usage and Microsoft uses it to customize the system &mdash; and give you advertising. You can turn it off, however.</p>



<p>Open <strong><em>Settings</em></strong>, <strong><em>Personalization </em></strong>and go to <strong><em>Device usage</em></strong>. Put everything in <strong><em>Off</em></strong> if you don&rsquo;t want to supply this info to Microsoft.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="adjust-your-microsoft-account">Adjust your Microsoft account&hellip;</h2>



<p>If you want to have full control of your Microsoft account, you can visit your Privacy Panel via your browser.</p>



<p>Go to <strong><em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://account.microsoft.com/privacy&amp;xcust=2-1-2012154-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">account.microsoft.com/privacy </a></em></strong>and sign in with your Microsoft account. At the top you can select <strong><em>Get started </em></strong>to launch a wizard that controls your settings. You can also select <strong><em>Manage your activity data </em></strong>to make the changes manually.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="and-control-other-programs">&hellip; and control other programs</h2>



<p>You can also make similar settings in other Microsoft products, such as Xbox or Microsoft Teams.</p>



<p>Open your Microsoft account&rsquo;s <strong><em>privacy panel </em></strong>(as above) and select <strong><em>Privacy settings in our products</em></strong>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="do-not-share-the-clipboard">Do not share the clipboard</h2>



<p>Nowadays, Windows has a powerful cloud clipboard manager that saves the clipboards of all your device and allows you to synchronize them in a common clipboard list. It&rsquo;s incredibly handy, but if this feels like a privacy issue, you can turn it off.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows settings screenshot" class="wp-image-2012190" height="898" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/windows-clipboard.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>



<p>Open <strong><em>Settings</em></strong>, <strong><em>System </em></strong>and select <strong><em>Clipboard</em></strong>. Switch off the <strong><em>Clipboard history </em></strong>or choose not to synchronize clips between devices. You can also select <strong><em>Clear </em></strong>to delete the history in the cloud.</p>

<p>To be more anonymous while browsing, you can use a virtual private network (VPN) service. It makes it harder to track you and allows you to &lsquo;switch countries&rsquo; on your connection, which can open up locked streaming services.</p>



<p>A VPN is a paid service that you subscribe to, however. Once you subscribe, you can install a special Windows program (or mobile app) to switch the service on or off and choose which country you want to surf in. Our guide to<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-apps-reviews-buying-advice.html"> the best VPNs </a>can point you in the right direction.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="hide-what-youve-done">Hide what you&rsquo;ve done</h2>



<p>Windows can show what documents and other things you&rsquo;ve recently opened. However, this can be hidden, which can be useful if other people you use your computer.</p>



<p>Open <strong><em>Settings </em></strong>and select <strong><em>Personalization</em></strong>, <strong><em>Start</em></strong>. Here you can switch off the feature <strong><em>Show recently opened items</em></strong>&hellip; As you can see, there are also other notifications you can disconnect.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="stop-sharing-between-devices">Stop sharing between devices</h2>



<p>A new feature in Windows deals with synchronizing software settings and other data between different computers where you are signed into the same Microsoft account. If you have a desktop and a laptop, for example, this can be very handy, but if you only have one computer, sending data to the cloud may seem unnecessary.</p>



<p>Open <strong><em>Settings </em></strong>and select <strong><em>Apps</em></strong>, <strong><em>Advanced app settings</em></strong>. Tap on <strong><em>Share across devices </em></strong>and switch off the feature or choose how to use it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that I&rsquo;m a big fan of Chromebooks. I adore the straightforward nature of them. I like the lack of bells and whistles, which suits me just fine because I primarily use mine as a work machine. Nowadays, Chromebooks come in just about every kind of variety, from gaming machines to luxurious convertibles. Although convertible Chromebooks, aka 2-in-1s, aren&rsquo;t new to the tech world, there are a couple of real standouts. Asus&rsquo; new Chromebook CM34 Flip is one such example.</p>



<p>The CM34 Flip is a good laptop for the everyday person. You&rsquo;ll find AMD hardware under the hood as well as a touch-enabled display with skinny bezels, a 360-degree hinge, and phenomenal battery life. As far as features and functionalities go, this specific machine checks off a lot of boxes. Having used various Chromebooks for the last couple of years or so (I consider myself to be well-versed in this category), I can confidently say that the CM34 Flip is well worth the money. Let&rsquo;s get into it.</p>

<p>Our review unit came equipped with an AMD R3-7320C CPU, AMD Radeon graphics, 16GB of RAM, and 128GB of PCIe SSD storage. It comes in the Ponder Blue color scheme, which is rather attractive.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="asus-chromebook-cm34-flip-design-and-build-quality">Asus Chromebook CM34 Flip: Design and build quality</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Asus Chromebook Flip design" class="wp-image-2002218" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/asus-chromebook-flip-design.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Ashley Biancuzzo</p></div>



<p>The dark blue color scheme is definitely subtle, but that&rsquo;s not necessarily a bad thing. There&rsquo;s an air of sophistication here. I know I wouldn&rsquo;t mind bringing this laptop to an important business meeting. It&rsquo;s not ugly, per se, but maybe just a touch on the boring side. We operate in a world of gray rectangular boxes, so I like seeing a nice pop of color every now and then, even if that color is more understated. It&rsquo;s still a nice touch.</p>



<p>What surprised me was the weight of the machine. For a convertible laptop, it&rsquo;s pretty heavy. When I removed it from the box, I could feel all four pounds of it weighing down my arms. That&rsquo;s not what I was expecting. While I was disappointed in the general heaviness, it gets brownie points for durability, as it definitely feels well-made. When I flipped the screen around 360 degrees, the hinge holding the screen to the rest of the laptop was nice and tight. I didn&rsquo;t notice any creaking in the keyboard deck, either.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>If you&rsquo;re on the hunt for a long-lasting everyday machine, you really can&rsquo;t get much better than this. Holy cow.</p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="asus-chromebook-cm34-flip-keyboard-and-trackpad">Asus Chromebook CM34 Flip: Keyboard and trackpad</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Asus Flip keyboard and touchpad" class="wp-image-2002226" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/asus-chromebook-keyboard-and-touchpad.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Ashley Biancuzzo</p></div>



<p>Overall, the keyboard is nice to use. It&rsquo;s a full-sized backlit keyboard that allows for 1.4mm of travel. I&rsquo;m of the mind that if I use a keyboard long enough, I&rsquo;ll get accustomed to it regardless of whether it stinks or not. Fortunately, this keyboard is pretty good for a laptop keyboard.<em> </em>I like that it&rsquo;s full-sized, which leaves a good amount of space between the keys and the backlighting is nice for typing in low-light environments. It doesn&rsquo;t include a numpad, but that&rsquo;s more common on gaming laptops.</p>



<p>The touchpad is phenomenal, however. It measures 5.55-inches and it sits right in the center of the keyboard deck. It registered my taps and swipes with ease. I could also zoom in and out in one smooth, seamless motion. If there were any misfires, they were few and far between. I found that I adapted to it right away.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="asus-chromebook-cm34-flip-display-audio">Asus Chromebook CM34 Flip: Display, audio</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Asus Chromebook display" class="wp-image-2002230" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/asus-chromebook-display.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Ashley Biancuzzo</p></div>



<p>I really like the display&rsquo;s 16:10 aspect ratio as well as the ultra-slim bezels. You&rsquo;re getting a good amount of screen here. I found that it was super easy for me to scroll through a long article I was editing. It&rsquo;s also a good screen for watching Netflix, YouTube videos, and so on. When I watched the trailer for the new <em>Barbie </em>movie, the various shades of pink in Barbie&rsquo;s fantastically outrageous world were both vibrant and sharp. By the way, the display features a resolution of 1920&times;1080 and a refresh rate of 60Hz. That&rsquo;s perfectly suitable for general-purpose use or office work.</p>



<p>My only gripe with the display is that it&rsquo;s super reflective in outside environments. I like to work from my deck on nice days, but it&rsquo;s almost impossible to do so with the Flip because it&rsquo;s so difficult to see the display under direct sunlight. In term of brightness, it measures about 300 nits, which is fine for indoor but outside is another story. That said, this isn&rsquo;t unusual for touchscreen laptops. If you don&rsquo;t typically use your laptop outside, then you probably won&rsquo;t ever encounter this problem.</p>



<p>I don&rsquo;t consider myself much of an audiophile, but even I can appreciate clear-sounding speakers. The Flip is outfitted with Harman Kardon-certified&nbsp;speakers, which have a bit of a punch to them (that&rsquo;s a good thing). I&rsquo;m a child of the &rsquo;90s, so I&rsquo;ve got a carefully curated playlist playing at all times. When I started playing music from The Cranberries, Dolores O&rsquo;Riordan&rsquo;s (RIP) powerful vocals sounded crisp and full. I&rsquo;d say the speakers are powerful enough to fill a medium-sized room with sound. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="asus-chromebook-cm34-flip-webcam">Asus Chromebook CM34 Flip: Webcam</h2>



<p>The 1080p webcam is a nice perk, that&rsquo;s for sure. With so many people working from home (hi!) these days, it just makes sense to equip laptops with 1080p webcams instead of the cheaper 720p fare. Frankly, I don&rsquo;t want to look grainy in videoconferencing calls. Overall, I was pleased with the quality of this webcam. Colors looked rich and warm, and I didn&rsquo;t notice any blurring around my face. Background details were relatively clear, too.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="asus-chromebook-cm34-flip-connectivity">Asus Chromebook CM34 Flip: Connectivity</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Asus Chromebook ports" class="wp-image-2002236" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/asus-chromebook-ports.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Ashley Biancuzzo</p></div>



<p>The Flip has a nice selection of ports. You&rsquo;re getting one HDMI 2.1, two USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C, one USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A, one audio jack, one microSD card reader, and one Kensington lock slot. That&rsquo;s a good variety right there, so you don&rsquo;t really need to keep an adapter with you. This is good news for those times when you want to plug in an external mouse or monitor. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="asus-chromebook-cm34-flip-performance">Asus Chromebook CM34 Flip: Performance</h2>



<p>The Flip is one of the first to include AMD&rsquo;s new line of Chromebook-specific CPUs. The AMD Ryzen 3 7320C CPU contains four cores and eight threads, which means it&rsquo;s capable of handling multiple tasks and applications at once. I didn&rsquo;t notice much slowdown when I was jumping from tab to tab within the browser. However, it&rsquo;s important to taper your expectations, as it&rsquo;s not the strongest performer out there. It&rsquo;s better than those with Snapdragon CPUs, sure, but it&rsquo;s not going to perform like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1475407/the-acer-chromebook-spin-514-review.html">Acer Chromebook Spin 514</a>, which boasts an AMD Ryzen 5 5625C.</p>

<p>The Spin 514 has a CPU with six cores and 12 threads, which means it&rsquo;s more powerful in the processing department. The more cores, the better. However, the Spin is also more expensive due to that hardware. The Flip can handle everyday tasks just fine and if that&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;re looking for, then it won&rsquo;t disappoint. Here&rsquo;s how the Asus Chromebook CM34 Flip performed in our browser-based benchmarks:</p>



<ul>
<li>CrXPRT 2: 148</li>



<li>Speedometer: 73.7</li>



<li>Basemark Web 3.0: 725.03</li>



<li>Kraken: 716.7</li>



<li>Jetstream 2: 171.377</li>
</ul>



<p>The Acer Chromebook Spin 514, for example, earned a score of 210 in our Speedometer benchmark, which measures the responsiveness of web applications. The Flip, on the other hand, scored just 73.7. If I had to guess, it&rsquo;s likely due to the Flip&rsquo;s CPU, which doesn&rsquo;t have as many cores or threads. In real-world use, I&rsquo;m not sure you&rsquo;d notice that much of a difference between the machines as far as performance goes, unless you intentionally run the Flip into the ground by overwhelming it with a bunch of open tabs and applications. It&rsquo;s not a powerful Windows machine, but then again it&rsquo;s not trying to be.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="asus-chromebook-cm34-flip-battery-life">Asus Chromebook CM34 Flip: Battery life</h2>



<p>The Flip lasted a jaw-dropping 19 hours on a single charge, which is positively wild. In fact, I ended up running the benchmark twice because I was so surprised by the result and felt the need to verify it. Here at PCWorld, we run the CrXPRT 2 battery benchmark on Chromebooks, which cycles through various tasks until the laptop dies. The Flip&rsquo;s 60 watt hour battery is a larger size, so I expected it to reach the 10 hour mark, but the final result exceeded my expectations. If you&rsquo;re on the hunt for a long-lasting everyday machine, you really can&rsquo;t get much better than this. Holy cow.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="asus-chromebook-cm34-flip-should-you-buy-it">Asus Chromebook CM34 Flip: Should you buy it?</h2>



<p>With its vibrant touchscreen, 2-in-1 form factor, and fantastic battery life, the Flip has a lot to offer at this price point. It&rsquo;s a good option for college students or those who just need an everyday machine. The touchpad is spacious and the 1080p webcam captures clear, colorful video. It&rsquo;s heavier than most convertible laptops, which may be a deal-breaker to some folks. You may end up with a sore shoulder if you plan on lugging it around day after day. That said, if you don&rsquo;t mind the additional heft, it&rsquo;s a really good value buy.</p>
