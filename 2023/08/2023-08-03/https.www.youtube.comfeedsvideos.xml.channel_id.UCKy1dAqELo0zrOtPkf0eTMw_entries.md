On today's Daily Fix:
Nintendo has outlined upcoming Nintendo Switch exclusives and still lists the long-absent Metroid Prime 4 as a Switch game. Nintendo saw huge revenue and profit gains off the back of the enormous success of Tears of the Kingdom and The Super Mario Bros. Movie. Capcom’s Resident Evil 2 remake has sold more copies than any other title in the horror franchise’s 27-year history, after passing 12.6 million cumulative lifetime sales across console and PC.

Patrice Capullo (Uma Thurman) has a big problem, her art gallery isn’t making money. Gordon Davis (Samuel l. Jackson) has an even bigger problem, while arranging hits for the mob is lucrative, he and his”colleague” Reggie Pitt (Joe Manganiello) need a better way to launder their money. A chance introduction through Patrices’s drug dealer has the art world meet the underworld, and a plan is hatched.

The one hitch: Patrice needs something to sell. With that, Reggie taps into his inner artist and makes a painting which immediately “sells” for an incredibly high price. When the noteworthy price for this new mystery artist accidentally leaks, the art career of “The Bagman” is born, attracting attention and press, something his superiors in the underworld are very unhappy with.

## Meg 2: The Trench Review

Meg 2: The Trench reviewed by Matt Donato. Narrated by Mark Medina.

Meg 2: The Trench has all the excitement of fishing solo for two hours without a single bite. Wheatley is a shell of himself behind the camera, devoid of personality and originality. If you copy greed-driven subplots, underwater escape sequences, and helmet-imploding deaths from better movies, maybe don’t make it so obvious, especially when it seems like the studio overseers don’t care enough about delivering a sequel that carries individual value. Meg 2: The Trench is a terrible megalodon-sized blunder haplessly cobbled together using parts stripped from throughout genre history, all made impotent and dulled in far lesser hands.

Loki Season 2 is right around the corner and Disney+ has dropped a brand new trailer for the upcoming series. Nestled in the teaser is what we think just may be the solution to Marvel Studios' Kang problem: Revona Renslayer.

Tom Hiddleston, Owen Wilson, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Teresa DiMartino and the rest of the cast are back for the return of one of the biggest Disney+ shows to date in this Loki Season 2 teaser, which gives us a glimpse of Mobius and Loki back together again, as well as introducing Ke Huy Quan to the MCU! The Marvel Cinematic Universe will continue its multiversal adventures as the Multiverse Saga continues, but what's the fate of the Kang Dynasty? Jonathan Majors' legal troubles leave a lot of questions for the future of the big bad.

This official Loki season 2 trailer doesn't give us all of the answers, but we do have an idea about how Judge Renslayer can step in and solve Marvel's Kang problem.

In today's Daily Fix:
Microsoft is planning something BIG for gamescom 2023, like literally the biggest booth they've ever made. Lucky attendees to this year's show are going to get to play more than 30 new and upcoming games, plus hang out in a 300-seat theatre to watch a new Starfield presentation. In other news, Post Malone just bought The One Ring. No, not the one that was forged in Mount Doom by the Dark Lord Sauron, of which he poured all his malice into so he can control the other Rings of Power, but the super rare, one-of-a-kind The One Ring Magic the Gathering card. He hasn't disclosed how much he paid, but the original owner of the card is probably very happy. And we tell you how you can rate your favorite games to introduce them in the ultimate pantheon of greatness - the Pringles Icons! This episode is brought to you by Pringles.
