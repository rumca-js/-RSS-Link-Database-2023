<p>As rightwing media and the mayor target a Queens neighborhood, sex workers say they’re just trying to survive</p><p>In 2000, Cecilia Gentili worked late nights as a sex worker on Roosevelt Avenue, a dusty corridor linking Queens’ most diverse communities, under the shadow of the clattering 7 train. It was the only way she could survive as a new immigrant. After coming out as trans, she had been shut out by employers in her native Argentina, and in New York, “I really thought that things would be different,” she says. “But in a way, it was a double level of discrimination: being trans and being undocumented. So again, I found myself engaged in street sex work.”</p><p>She rented a $150-a-month room in a shared apartment in Jackson Heights, a neighborhood full of other immigrants and queer and trans sex workers trying to help each other scrape by. “When I needed a place to live, it was not the city of New York that facilitated it, it was another sex worker. When I needed to eat, it was another trans person,” she says. If she felt unsafe on the street, she’d walk to a late-night street vendor and stand in their lamp’s warm glow.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/03/sex-workers-new-york-police-eric-adams">Continue reading...</a>

There will inevitably be winners and losers, one or two of them familiar names.</p><p>If the process is marginally less fraught, with 33 players now permitted instead of the previous 31, it does not lessen the thrill for those chosen or the despair for those omitted. Borthwick knows both emotions, having missed the cut in 2003 after training with the wider squad all summer. It explains his desire to be as upfront with the current crop as he possibly can.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/03/steve-borthwick-knows-cohesion-is-key-for-england-but-flair-must-flourish-too">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Britain’s 14th successive rise signals a grim 2024 for the economy and for Rishi Sunak’s government</p><p>The surprise would have been if it had not happened. As a result, the markets – political markets as well as financial ones – were able to greet this week’s 0.25% <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy-summary-and-minutes/2023/august-2023" title="">increase</a> in the cost of borrowing with something resembling a collective shrug of the shoulders. This 14th successive rise, taking UK base interest rates to 5.25%, had been largely priced in. A 15th is widely expected, so the price of money for businesses and mortgage holders is likely to go on rising to levels that have not been seen since before the financial crisis of 2008.</p><p>Ordinary borrowers are unlikely to be so phlegmatic. More than 1.4 million people hold variable rate mortgages. For them, the latest rise twists the screw even more tightly, piling on fresh costs to the hundreds of pounds that have been added to their monthly bills since rates began their steep climb from that distant 0.1% rate that still applied at the start of last year. Do not forget the additional deterrent effect of all this, not just in discouraging new customers from taking out new mortgages but also in the inevitable knock-on consequences for an increasingly sluggish construction sector.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/03/the-guardian-view-on-high-interest-rates-losing-the-race-against-time">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Alice Oseman’s tale of queer romance is a global success story built on fans who want to feel good about themselves in tough times</p><p>After boy met boy in a crowdfunded graphic novel set in a British grammar school in 2018, hearts began to flutter and tills started to ring around the world.

Popularised through social media channels, it helped <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jun/08/lockdown-exploded-tiktok-books-revolution-booktok" title="">to keep bookshops afloat </a>through, and after, the pandemic, while spreading a feelgood spirit among its young, multimedia-savvy, readers, to whom it has sold 8m copies.

But that is exactly what Moeen did last winter when asked if he fancied a piece of England’s historic return to Pakistan, the country of his birth, after 17 long years.</p><p>You can see why McCullum and Stokes wanted to ask the question. Moeen’s style and personality fit the freewheeling cricket they espouse. But Moeen was unequivocal. “Sorry I’m done. It’s time to close the door on that side of my career,” came the response. Six months later, Jack Leach suffers a stress fracture of the lower-back and Stokes comes back for another go. This time successfully.

<p>An uncomplicatedly bad villain used to feature in every action film worth its salt, but a more globalised industry has made the universally hated figure a tricky character to pull off</p><p>Early on in the new Mission Impossible film, a group of sharp-suited intelligence agents gather to discuss a grave new threat to national security. Their nemesis is apparently a “godless, stateless enemy” which is “everywhere and nowhere”, “a self-aware, self-learning, truth-eating digital parasite”. Your heart sinks slightly as you realise that Tom Cruise’s latest adversary is in fact a sentient computer code. An action movie without a real villain? Hans Gruber would be spinning in his grave.</p><p>Seasoned Cruise fans, though, will know not to panic.

## Cancer is striking more people in the prime of their lives. What can we do better? | Ranjana Srivastava

<p>Patients must better advocate for themselves while doctors need to realise that cancer is a disease of the old <em>and</em> young</p><p>Shortly after turning 40, I experienced an abnormal tiredness that I ignored for as long as I could. When I began pulling over to catch a microsleep before clinic, I was moved to see my GP who diagnosed severe iron deficiency. She suggested that along with replenishing the iron, I have a workup for “less common causes”. I am an oncologist; I knew what she meant.</p><p>In corridor consults with my former classmates, I tried to convince myself and them that an iron infusion was all I needed for my presumed nutritional deficit. My gastroenterologist friend, fresh from a “his and her” colonoscopy to celebrate the couple’s 40th birthday, dissuaded me but the cancer surgeon was blunt: “I operate on people like you every week, so I’d get that scope.” The worst thing about the colonoscopy was the trepidation because I was asleep for the procedure and thankfully, it found nothing sinister. Sobered, I resolved not be my own doctor again.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/04/cancer-is-striking-more-people-in-the-prime-of-their-lives-what-can-we-do-better">Continue reading...</a>

<p>At his grandfather’s funeral in 2021, Victor Belmondo described the legendary nouvelle vague star as an ‘eternal sun’. Now beginning to light up the screen himself, he talks about trying to capture his predecessor’s famous insouciance</p><p>It can be both a head start and a burden to bear the name of an illustrious predecessor – but what if you look like him, too? Victor Belmondo’s pillowy lips purse in amusement when the inevitable question comes up. “It’s not annoying. I get it,” he says. Although a touch less pugnacious-looking, he is unmistakably of the same lineage as his grandfather, Jean-Paul. “I know the name I have and who my grandfather was. From the moment I do the same job, it’s normal people have questions. As long as we talk about my films as well, it’s OK.”</p><p>So we park the trifling matter of Jean-Paul, who died two years ago, to chat about other things. Belmondo, 29, has been quietly firing up his own acting career, this month with a meaty supporting role in Lie With Me (Arrête avec tes Mensonges), a faintly Almodóvarian homecoming drama directed by Olivier Peyon. He plays Lucas, who works for a distillery in the town of Cognac that is welcoming back – 35 years after he left – a bestselling novelist, Stéphane, to act as its brand ambassador. But both men are forced to grapple with the past: Stéphane’s unrequited first love was Lucas’s late father.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/03/victor-belmondo-i-wanted-to-be-an-actor-i-never-said-to-myself-yes-but-thats-what-papi-does-too">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Yet another political leaflet is under fire for targeting these groups. What will it take for us to see this racism for what it is?</p><p>When I arrived at the north London pub 20 minutes late, my friend was midway through her latest romantic drama. She was having relationship troubles with her (live-in!) boyfriend of two weeks, and with every twist and turn in the story our noisy histrionics increased. Across from us, a group of about 30 people sat spread across several tables, quietly enjoying a twixtmas drink. After an abortive attempt to secure a drink through the app, I went to the bar.</p><p>As I arrived, two of the people from the tables across from us were also there, attempting to do the same. The staff behind the bar refused to serve them and when they argued back, the whole bar was shut. As I returned to the table, my friend was still in full flow. Over her shoulder, I saw the ominous hi-vis jackets of two Metropolitan police officers enter the pub and talk to the bar staff before approaching the group next to us. Before long another dozen or so arrived, demanding that they leave. Their crime? Being Travellers in a pub.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/03/gypsy-traveller-life-political-leaflet-mps-racism">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Shakespeare’s Globe, London</strong><br />Gender swapped roles shed new light on dark days in a production – complete with gruesome bodybags and references to fake news – that feels aptly aligned to our times</p><p>Max Bennett’s Macbeth at Shakespeare’s Thameside replica reaches for the crown just ahead of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/13/hamilton-star-reuben-joseph-to-play-macbeth-for-the-rsc">Reuben Joseph for the RSC</a> in Stratford-upon-Avon this month and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/may/05/david-tennant-macbeth-donmar-warehouse">David Tennant in London, in December</a>. Why might there be sudden interest in Shakespeare’s study of someone who ruthlessly pursues power and then proves unsuited to it? To even up casting opportunity, most classical stagings now ignore the old code of M (male) and F (female) roles. The approach here, though, is less gender-neutral than gender-pointed. Director Abigail Graham makes the witches not weird sisters but a trio of sinister brothers wearing full hazmat suits and birds-of-prey masks.</p><p>Atmospherically, Macbeth is Shakespeare’s darkest play – there is comment on the sun’s reluctance to rise – but at the open-air Globe, even in a dull summer, this short play is almost wholly day-lit. Darkness must descend in other ways. Aaron Anthony finds the full shock and horror in the tricky lines where Macduff learns his family’s fate, and fight director Bret Yount contrives unnervingly convincing murders.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/03/macbeth-review-max-bennetts-jokey-king-is-clearly-unfit-to-govern">Continue reading...</a>

Jean, who the Guardian is identifying by her middle name to protect her identity during ongoing divorce litigation, had separated from her husband two years earlier. She had already been granted a domestic violence restraining order in Alameda county, California, after experiencing what she describes as physical, emotional, mental and sexual abuse. But in the meantime,<strong> </strong>shared loans and expenses between Jean and her ex-partner had been piling up. Since Jean was the account holder on most of their credit cards, she was beholden to the bank.

## ‘He’s clumsy, high, and completely unprepared’: Baby Steps, a game about falling flat on your face

<p>Development trio Gabe Cuzzillo, Maxi Boch, and Bennett Foddy are back with a story about a failson basement-dweller trying not to fall flat on his face</p><p></p><p>Game developers Gabe Cuzzillo, Maxi Boch and Bennett Foddy have been friends for over a decade, having met through <a href="https://gamecenter.nyu.edu/">NYU’s Game Centre</a>, and they already have one successful indie game under their belt. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/8/18255975/ape-out-game-pc-nintendo-switch">Ape Out</a> had you smashing through halls full of goons as a rampaging gorilla to the tune of a procedural jazz soundtrack. Their next game, Baby Steps, is equally unconventional. A walking simulator in a very literal sense, you’ll awkwardly steer Nate, a caked-up, onesie-wearing basement dweller, to the top of a misty mountain. And often, you’ll fall flat on your face.</p><p>“On a controller, players use the triggers to lift and plant each foot while using the left stick to move the lifted foot around in the air, manually taking each of Nate’s steps,” Cuzzillo says. Using this literalist control scheme, reminiscent of Foddy’s earlier games like <a href="http://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html">QWOP</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/240720/Getting_Over_It_with_Bennett_Foddy/">Getting Over It</a>, the team want players to get into a rhythm as they hike, taking in the eclectic sights and letting their minds wander. “That hypnotic space you can get into as you walk is a big part of the appeal of hiking to me,” Cuzzillo said. “We’re trying to capture a bit of that here.”</p><p>Baby Steps is coming to PlayStation 5 and PC in 2024.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/aug/03/hes-clumsy-high-and-completely-unprepared-baby-steps-a-game-about-literally-finding-your-feet">Continue reading...</a>

Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) is desperately trying to shimmy her way into a full-body, horse saddle-sized strap-on. Her partner, Che Diaz (Sara Ramirez), is sprawled across the bed with their T-shirt still on, casually watching in the way you might a sports channel. There is no foreplay. “Can we move this along?” Che says, bored and impatient. “I’ve got a set at the Comedy Store at nine.” Miranda continues struggling with her leather contraption, as Che takes a phone call.</p><p>It’s an excruciating watch, although it’s hard to pinpoint exactly why. Maybe it’s because Che Diaz is so profoundly grating that you can’t believe Miranda would be, quite literally, bending herself backwards for them. Maybe it’s because, as a person of lesbian experience, I know that there is absolutely no need for a strap-on that mathematical and complex.

## The Australian Ballet: Jewels review – lots of glitter but no gold

<p>George Balanchine’s choreography is gorgeous to look at, and there are standout individual performances, but it really needs more lush grandeur</p><p><br />It’s 35 years since the Australian Ballet last performed at London’s Royal Opera House, a long absence, and interesting that the piece they’ve chosen to bring isn’t something unique to the company, or a tribute to their British roots (the company was founded 60 years ago by Londoner <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/discover-culture/ng-interactive/2014/jul/22/the-australian-ballet-the-grande-dame-at-a-glance">Peggy van Praagh</a>) but Jewels by George Balanchine, the choreographer who epitomises American ballet.<br /><br />Such is the international business of dance. The Australian company’s director since 2021 is David Hallberg, a former star dancer of American Ballet Theatre and the first American principal at the Bolshoi. Conquering Balanchine is a marker of a company’s technical achievements. It inevitably invites comparisons to the New York City Ballet dancers, who have this style drilled into them from childhood, but great choreography stands up to differing interpretations.</p><p>A shameless corporate tie-in, 1967’s Jewels came out of a meeting between Balanchine and jewellers Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, both looking to boost their brands. Scatter the stage design (by Peter Harvey) and costumes (Barbara Karinska) with glittering gems, and you’ve got a very pretty scene. But it’s also a journey through different dance eras, French Romanticism in Emeralds, set to Fauré; Tchaikovsky and the classicism of imperial Russia in Diamonds; and the disjointed dazzle of early 20th-century New York in Rubies, soundtracked by Stravinsky.<br /><br />On the musical front, the Royal Ballet Sinfonia are on top form under Australian Ballet’s musical director (and regular Covent Garden conductor) Jonathan Lo. Their opening chords of Emeralds are played with sublime delicacy as the curtain rises to reveal the dancers in absinthe-coloured tulle. Emeralds is a ballet of soft hands and endless <em>bourrées</em> that could easily glide past you, but you can also focus in on the details. Valerie Tereshchenko dances as if suspended in a dream state, in motion like soundlessly scudding clouds, with graceful attention to the movement of her head and neck.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/03/the-australian-ballet-jewels-review-lots-of-glitter-but-no-gold">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Pleasance Dome, Edinburgh</strong><br />Wittily drawn historical drama follows self-effacing leader ill-equipped to deal with the encroaching Nazi menace</p><p>If you think actor Joseph Cullen is cartoonish at the start of this chewy true-life story, you should see the grotesque caricature he becomes. Playing Bulgaria’s wartime king, he is so self-effacing he looks about to crumple down the middle. He is placatory and feeble, the Beano’s Walter the Softy made flesh.</p><p>The joke in Hannah Hauer-King’s production, written by Cullen and Sasha Wilson, is that nobody in this neglected Balkan country can take themselves seriously. The five-strong ensemble josh their way through silly accents and meta-gags as they send up a nation that knows it will never be a player on the world stage and is too laidback to care.

Actor who starred in John Cassavetes’s Shadows and gave Michael Caine the plans for the heist in The Italian Job<p>The lacerating 1959 drama Shadows, a pinnacle of US independent film-making, heralded two striking new talents: the director <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/johncassavetes" title="">John Cassavetes</a> and the actor Lelia Goldoni, who was just 20 when she gave a guileless performance combining wistful romanticism and mercurial restlessness. She played Lelia – all the actors in the film share their first names with their characters – who is an African-American woman “passing” for white. Goldoni herself was of Sicilian descent.</p><p>When Lelia’s white boyfriend (Tony Ray, son of the director <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/sep/08/nicholas-ray-we-cant-go-home-again" title="">Nicholas</a>) meets one of her darker-skinned brothers (Hugh Hurd) and realises that she is black, his discomfort inflames tensions in the household and sends aftershocks through the rest of the film.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/03/lelia-goldoni-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Earache Records)<br /></strong>One minute it’s riffs and political rage, the next it’s summery reggae. Thanks to their craft – and frontman Benji Webbe’s joie de vivre – the band’s barrier-breaking album is a treat</p><p>Skindred’s eighth album begins with the sort of sonic blast you’d expect from a band making their debut on Earache Records, a label synonymous with noisy acts such as horror punks Misfits or Singaporean grindcore group Wormrot. Opener Our Religion sounds like a ragga Metallica and – sci-fi effects aside – is the sort of riff-laden festival-friendly anthem that has earned the Wales four-piece a hefty following at the heavier end of British music.</p><p>Within minutes, however, at the opposite end of the musical spectrum comes LOVE (Smile Please), a gloriously sunny banger just perfect for blasting out at barbecues, from open-topped cars and at Notting Hill carnival. With its skanking beat, parping horns and joyful, earworm lyrics (“I’ve got sunshine when it’s raining / I’ve got blessing when it’s pouring”), it’s a classic summer anthem in the lineage of the Piranhas’ cover of Tom Hark, Aswad’s crossover smash <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhkNb3XXats">Don’t Turn Around</a> or Bad Manners’ barmily infectious ska revival hits. It beggars belief that two such disparate songs can appear minutes apart on the same album, but it isn’t untypical of this band who debuted the bouncy anthem at last year’s Download metal festival yet have topped the US reggae charts.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/03/skindred-smile-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>3M, DuPont, Chemours and Corteva have agreed settlement in the billions for polluting drinking water with ‘forever chemicals’</p><p>When the chemical giant 3M agreed in early June to pay up to $12.5bn to settle a lawsuit over PFAS contamination in water systems across the nation, it was hailed by attorneys as “the largest drinking water settlement in American history”, and viewed as a significant win for the public in the battle against toxic “forever chemicals”.</p><p>A second June settlement with the PFAS manufacturers DuPont, Chemours and Corteva tallied a hefty <a href="https://www.dupont.com/news/chemours-dupont-and-corteva-reach-comprehensive-pfas-settlement-with-us-water-systems.html">$1.1bn</a>. But while the sums are impressive on their face, they represent just a fraction of the estimated $400bn some estimate will be needed to clean and protect the nation’s drinking water. Orange county, California, alone put <a href="https://www.natlawreview.com/article/california-water-district-pfas-lawsuit-1-billion-stake">the cost</a> of cleaning its system at $1bn.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/03/chemical-companies-pfas-payouts-forever-chemicals">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Jane, 62 and Abdel, 60, met in a small Berber town while she was travelling<strong> </strong>in Morocco in 2005. They married months later, and now split their time between Tafraoute and Cornwall</p><p>When Jane overheard a story on the radio about Barbary pirates raiding the Cornish coast near her home town, it sparked an idea for a historical novel. In spring 2005, she convinced a friend to accompany her to Tafraoute, Morocco, so she could research the story and learn more about the Berber perspective.</p><p>The area is famous for its rock climbing routes, and they soon met a group of other travellers. “They recommended a nearby restaurant,” says Jane. A local tribesman named Abdel opened the door to them. “I didn’t realise he was the chef but he had lots of charisma and we made a lot of eye contact.” Though he was busy working, Abdel noticed her immediately. “It was like an electric shock, for me,” he says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2023/aug/03/how-we-met-i-was-stranded-on-a-climb-i-called-for-help-and-he-answered">Continue reading...</a>

After Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year, attacking grain fields and silos and blocking Ukrainian ports, global food prices spiked to record levels and endangered much-needed food supply for many importer countries. The BSGI aimed to re-establish a vital route for agricultural exports from Ukraine and to lower global food prices.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/03/russia-food-vladimir-putin-black-sea-grain-initiative-eu-aid">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Three brothers are kidnapped from LA to their father’s Iran in this astonishingly accomplished tale of displacement and the search to belong</p><p>As an Iranian kid in America, my greatest nightmare was being kidnapped back to Iran. For those of us who had endured the “morality police”, gruelling escapes and long asylum battles, Iran was the hell at the border of our new American lives, and later, when I met other Iranian Americans my age, I found that I wasn’t alone.</p><p>I Will Greet the Sun Again, Khashayar J Khabushani’s tender and gut-wrenching debut novel, is a tightly constructed three-act drama exploring the long-term impact when three brothers are kidnapped to their father’s Iran. Set mostly in a sun-beaten, crumbling Los Angeles apartment complex, the story grabbed me from the start, not just for its vivid characters who never stop trying, or its meticulously realised settings, but for the winking way it speaks to Iranian Americans of the author’s generation, with Persian words sprinkled liberally throughout.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/03/i-will-greet-the-sun-again-by-khashayar-j-khabushani-review-a-tender-debut-of-iranian-us-identity">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A three-wheeler tour starting in Milan makes for a rollicking ride in the gorgeous scenery and small towns of the Italian Lakes</p><p>It’s hard to know if <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/milan">Milan</a>’s fashionistas are bemused more by my driving or by my vehicle as I stall, splutter and crunch the gears while double-parking the tuk-tuk on Via Monte Napoleone, the city’s swankiest street. Both it and I look comically out of place on a thoroughfare dripping with designer shops and high-end motors. I’ve just seen a Hermès shirt with a €10,500 price tag and spotted the Argentina World Cup winner and Inter Milan star Lautaro Martínez laden with Gucci shopping bags, and bouncing into a blacked-out Hummer with his girlfriend and minder.</p><p>Not that I’m here to shop. Our mission this morning is to take a photo of the three-wheeled contraption parked alongside a Ferrari or Lamborghini – which causes a mini traffic jam, much horn beeping and bewilderment as to why a ramshackle tuk-tuk is cluttering up the street.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/aug/03/tuk-tuk-adventure-across-northern-italy-milan-italian-lakes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It is normal and natural to wake in the early hours - but it can feel disastrous. Follow these simple steps to help you drift off</p><p>Time moves differently in the middle of the night. Hours can drag one moment, then race by the next, catapulting you between chronic boredom and violent panic that morning is clawing at the curtains. Yet, though it may not feel like it in the moment, it is entirely normal to wake up. “The natural human sleep pattern is not a consolidated eight hours,” says Russell Foster, professor of circadian neuroscience at Oxford University, and author of Life Time: The new science of the body clock, and how it can revolutionise your sleep and health. Still, it’s not pleasant to lie awake in the early hours worrying about everything from climate catastrophe to whether that was an inappropriate joke to put on that group chat, or whether you’ll ever sleep again – especially if it happens regularly. Here is some expert advice on how to stay calm plus what to do so that – hopefully – sleep will follow.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/aug/03/dont-check-the-clock-15-ways-to-get-back-to-sleep-when-you-wake-at-3am">Continue reading...</a>

## In a broken Britain, the Tories zero in on shoplifters stealing Calpol and food for their children | Owen Jones

<p>These thefts are crimes of poverty. Ministers’ threats to send culprits to prison will never solve them</p><p>Is an ever fiercer crackdown on the misdemeanours of the poor really justice? When a government minister suggests <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/shoplifters-face-prison-under-crime-crackdown-ggdbv3j99#:~:text=The%20government%20is%20prepared%20to,custody%20on%20those%20caught%20repeatedly.">building new prisons</a> to lock up shoplifters, Tory priorities are revealed in technicolour: that war should be waged on the symptoms, rather than the causes, of poverty. This is a tradition as British as drinking tea or Morris dancing. When the economy tanked after the 1720 “South Sea bubble” collapse, the so-called Black Act was passed, imposing the death penalty on the overwhelmingly poor Britons driven by hunger who poached animals in private parks in order to survive. Today’s justice system spares offenders the gallows, but it’s driven by the same class vengeance that defined it back then: witness how you’re <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/welfare/2021/02/new-you-re-23-times-more-likely-be-prosecuted-benefit-fraud-tax-fraud-uk">23 times more likely</a> to be prosecuted for benefit fraud than tax fraud, even though the latter costs the economy nine times more.</p><p>The Tories’ plan to cling on to power is now abundantly clear: appeal to the worst instincts of the electorate. Proffering mandatory prison sentences as a solution to persistent shoplifting is part of that grim package. In practice, that means scooping up more largely poor, often traumatised citizens, and locking them up in institutions so overcrowded that their staff’s trade union <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/prison-overcrowding-figures-disorder-sentences-b2342257.html">describes them as</a> a “powder keg waiting to blow”. That shoplifting is indelibly linked to poverty is beyond debate. Last year, even the new chief inspector of constabulary declared that officers should use “discretion” in prosecuting those who steal so they can eat, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/18/officers-should-use-discretion-over-stealing-to-eat-says-uk-police-watchdog">adding that</a> “whenever you see an increase in the cost of living or whenever you see more people dropping into poverty, I think you’ll invariably see a rise in crime.” He was correct: shoplifting has more than doubled in the last six years, reaching a staggering <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/01/one-guy-uses-us-like-a-larder-the-british-shoplifting-crisis-as-seen-from-the-tills">8m incidents last year</a>.</p><p>Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/03/shoplifting-crime-poverty-prisons-tories-law-and-order">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Anything seems possible in this massive RPG, but the trick isn’t magic technology, say developers at Larian Studios</p><p>“A scripter was convinced that it would make the scene complete if you could be turned into a wheel of cheese,” Larian Studios’ lead systems designer Nick Pechenin tells me. The main story of Baldur’s Gate 3 is about an invasion of tentacle-mouthed creatures that wouldn’t look out of place in one of HP Lovecraft’s Cthulhu horror stories, so a sidequest where a disgruntled wizard transforms you into cheese may seem out of place. But moments like this encapsulate why Larian is the game developer that comes closest to capturing the anarchic freedom of real-world sessions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</p><p>More than 20 years ago, before Mass Effect and Dragon Age, before even Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, much-loved developer BioWare made its name with Baldur’s Gate and its sequel. “When the original games came out, they were the bleeding edge of what was possible technologically, visually, and story-wise,” says Pechenin. “BioWare was trying to release a game that was as beautiful and as technologically powerful as could be humanly achieved at that stage; that’s what we are trying to do.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/aug/03/baldurs-gate-3-review-the-video-game-where-you-can-do-almost-anything">Continue reading...</a>

## Chasing Shadows by Miles Johnson review – criminal world

<p>A thriller-like tale of global drugs and terrorism that may be too complex for its own good</p><p>The holy grail for a certain genre of narrative nonfiction is a real-life story so fast paced and with such high stakes that it could match the page-turning tension of a fictional work from Robert Ludlum, Tom Clancy or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/lee-child" title="">Lee Child</a>. This is the terrain in which the Financial Times correspondent Miles Johnson has squarely pitched his debut, Chasing Shadows. To underline the point, the review copy comes with an endorsement from Child himself, who declares Chasing Shadows to be “as breathless, complex, and on-the-edge suspenseful as the finest thriller fiction – but it’s all real, which makes it truly extraordinary”.</p><p>The genre, then, feels familiar. This is a Manichean world in which the good guys are very good and the bad guys are extremely, relentlessly, nastily bad. Johnson introduces us to three leading men. The first is Jack Kelly, a hard-bitten agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration’s elite special operations division – “the Navy Seals of the DEA”, as one witness helpfully puts it – who carries a Glock and drives a Jeep Wrangler, about as macho a set of wheels as it is possible to buy. In the best tradition of heroic Hollywood lawmen, Kelly is a maverick and a loner who walks the mean streets so you don’t have to.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/03/chasing-shadows-by-miles-johnson-review-criminal-world">Continue reading...</a>

## Vanishing Act review: an outlandish take on a real scammer who made millions – and disappeared

<p>The story of  financier Melissa Caddick gripped Australia when she vanished, leaving behind her severed foot. What a shame this three-part drama makes little sense of the tale</p><p></p><p>After a string of dramas about real-life scams, I was beginning to wonder if anywhere was safe. We’ve had Inventing Anna, the story of Anna Sorokin/Delvey, who posed as a wealthy heiress among Manhattan’s elite, largely at their expense. Then there was The Dropout, about Elizabeth Holmes, currently in jail for defrauding those who invested in her bloodtesting company, which could not do the things it claimed. The Tinder Swindler concerned conman Simon Leviev/Shimon Hayut, who posed as the son of a diamond mogul and persuaded marks to “lend” him huge sums of money to save him from supposed enemies. As for Bad Vegan, you’ll have to look that up yourself – it begins with a promise to make a restaurateur’s dog immortal and beyond that I do not have time or space to explain.</p><p>The answer, thanks to Vanishing Act, appears to be no – nowhere is safe. This is the first Australian contribution to the true-scam drama genre to make it to our shores. It traces the disappearance of Melissa Caddick, a financier who vanished three days after the Australian Securities and Investment Commission raided her Sydney home. Four months later, her badly decomposed foot (confirmed by DNA testing) washed up on Bournda beach on the New South Wales coast 500km away from where she was last seen. In the meantime, it was discovered that she had been running a Ponzi scheme for over a decade, which, according to the show, took in more than A$40m (£20.5m) not just from strangers, but friends and family – including her parents – and left them all financially ruined.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/aug/03/vanishing-act-review-an-outlandish-take-on-a-real-scammer-who-made-millions-and-disappeared">Continue reading...</a>

This builds on his earlier comments that these jobs suit workers with disabilities.<br /><br />On the recently introduced digital “mid-life MOTs”, which are designed to help older workers with financial planning, health guidance and career skills, Stride said: “You really do need to sensibly stop, take where you are in life, and assess whether for example you’ve got enough money to get you through with the kind of lifestyle and living standards that you’re expecting.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/aug/03/over-50s-could-deliver-takeaways-says-work-and-pensions-secretary-mel-stride">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I once scoffed at the idea of ‘empty nest syndrome’. Now I scour camp photos like a homicide detective, on the lookout for scowls or sunburn</p><p>On Sunday I dropped off my kids at camp and, all going well, I won’t see or hear from them for two weeks. This wasn’t part of my plan for the summer. Sleepaway camp, a staple of American childhood, isn’t in my background and the whole idea of it filled me with dread. At their age – eight – I would have hated it, I’m sure, being sent away and forced to have fun. But my children aren’t me and they pushed and pushed until finally last week I gave in. So there they are, at a lake in New Jersey, and here I am, in New York, alone.</p><p>It should be good for all of us, this period of detachment.

## The Future Future by Adam Thirlwell review – the historical novel, subverted

<p>This slippery, anachronistic and strangely beautiful tale of patriarchy and power moves from revolutionary Paris to a lunar commune</p><p>Adam Thirlwell’s first novel in eight years is set in Paris in the period around the French Revolution. When we first meet Celine, she is a peripheral figure at the court of the dauphin; at 19, she has recently been married off to Sasha, a 46-year-old minor government official and ruthless “fascist”. She has also become the focus of a series of pamphlets, provenance unknown, containing pornographic fictions based on her life. In the early pages of the novel, Celine has been made into a kind of symbol of all that is rotten at the heart of French high society, and is attempting to deal with the fallout from her unjust erotic infamy – most pressingly its effects on her thuggish and abusive husband. Along with her friends Marta and Julia, Celine hosts a series of glamorous parties, a deliberate gambit to attract writers into her orbit, as a means of wresting back control of the narrative of her life. (“In a world made of writing,” we are told, “malevolent writing could only be erased by more writing.”)</p><p>This might make the book sound like a relatively conventional work of historical fiction, but it is nothing of the sort. Thirlwell has never been one to play it straight – his 2012 novel <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/25/kapow-adam-thirlwell-review" title="">Kapow!</a> employed enough typographical trickery to outdo <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/max-porter" title="">Max Porter</a>; 2013’s collection Multiples was a sort of multilingual parlour game of literary translation – and as the use of the word “fascist” to describe an 18th-century French civil servant might suggest, his deliberate deployment of jarring anachronism is more than just a startling textural effect: it’s at the centre of the book’s artful design.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/03/the-future-future-by-adam-thirlwell-review-the-historical-novel-subverted">Continue reading...</a>

Uxbridge in July, and the drama over who succeeds Boris Johnson as local MP is reaching its climax.
