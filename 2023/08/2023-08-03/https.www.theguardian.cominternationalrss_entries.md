<p>The experiences of cities in California and Colorado suggest that growth caps don’t work to make cost of living more affordable – but other mechanisms can</p><p>In 2017, Stephanie Deveaux noticed her city and neighborhood were changing. Lying on Denver’s western outskirts, Lakewood was known for its spacious single-family homes, good public schools, pristine parks and Rocky Mountain views. But many of the things that made Lakewood so livable seemed under threat.</p><p>“All these multiunit dwellings [were] starting to be developed,” she said, referring to the boxy, ultramodern and monotone buildings now scattered across Lakewood. “And then lands that I thought had been earmarked for open space, those started to get filled up.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/03/colorado-city-housing-growth-caps">Continue reading...</a>

La Rochefoucauld’s take on romance, here, might sound a touch cynical, but it’s fair to say that the way our heart flutters is governed, at least in part, by the pages we flick.</p><p>For generation Xers, the formative love canon has a decidedly ironic edge.

## Men in the arena: can indoor football be revived in the US?

<p>Leagues like the IFL are minuscule in comparison to the behemoth that is the NFL. But they are often popular in the smaller markets they serve</p><p>Despite being one of the game’s most well-known features, indoor football’s condensed dimensions are still shocking to fans accustomed to gridiron’s traditional, significantly more popular outdoor form. At 50 yards long and 28⅓ yards wide, an indoor football field offers players roughly one-quarter the area of an NFL field.</p><p>To accommodate for this, indoor football permits fewer on-field players than its outdoor equivalent (eight and 11, respectively). You’ll notice, however, that the number of players isn’t reduced by nearly the same extent as the playing area. As a result, indoor football fields are <em>crowded</em> and, with so many players crammed into so small an area, the games are action-packed – and that’s even before accounting for the padded walls.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/03/indoor-arena-football-nfl-football">Continue reading...</a>

## The aftermath: how the Beirut explosion has left scars on an already broken Lebanon

<p>Three years ago, a huge explosion ripped the city apart – and with it people’s hopes for rebuilding. The most vulnerable, many of them women, are bearing the brunt of Lebanon’s endless disasters</p><p>The fourth of August 2020 was an extremely hot and humid day in Lebanon. I was stuck at home at my computer, working remotely because of the pandemic. I was finishing my afternoon shift as a senior producer and correspondent for Associated Press, covering Lebanon and the wider Middle East. I was at the mercy of an unreliable internet connection and enduring, like most Lebanese, the scorching heat and recurrent power cuts. Lebanon’s power outages date back to the 15-year civil war that ended in 1990, and have still not been resolved to this day.</p><p>My house is about 7 miles from Beirut, nestled on a hill that overlooks a small and peaceful pine wood. Beirut and its surroundings had become a stifling concrete jungle, and I was feeling lucky to have trees to look at and access to some outdoor space during the long summer days. I had no plans to go to the city that day. At about 6pm I went to the kitchen to feed my cat, which was waiting for me in the garden. It was our daily ritual. As I opened the window and emptied the canned food into a bowl, I heard the familiar roar of warplanes racing through our skies. Israeli warplanes have been <a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20220613-israel-violated-lebanon-airspace-over-22000-times-since-2007-report-finds/" title="">violating Lebanese airspace</a> for decades, but the jet fighters were exceptionally frequent that summer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/03/port-of-beirut-explosion-aftermath-scars-on-already-broken-lebanon">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Following season one’s fairytale ending, what’s next for Nick and Charlie? The show continues to tackle the complexities of adolescence – teenagers and adults will adore it</p><p></p><p>The first season of Heartstopper had an unexpected afterlife. The series, adapted from the popular young-adult graphic novels by Alice Oseman, was a hit among its intended audience of teenagers, but it also tapped into the complicated heartache of older viewers. Many LGBTQ+ adults found themselves moved by its portrait of queer adolescence, describing it as what they wished they could have experienced themselves. For many, the wholesome romance between two teenage boys had a bittersweet edge to it.</p><p>Its return comes with the weight of expectation on its shoulders. Much of the first run chronicled the will-they-won’t-they between popular rugby player Nick (Kit Connor) and the artier Charlie (Joe Locke), who was bullied after his classmates found out he was gay. But the gentleness of its approach was all part of its charm. Charlie had a group of similarly arty friends, who supported him through the trials and tribulations of coming out, and his crush on Nick had a fairytale ending.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/aug/03/heartstopper-season-two-review-this-lgbtq-teen-drama-is-even-sweeter-and-lovelier-than-before">Continue reading...</a>

<p>By offering unconditional love and validation, parents can empower their child to speak their truth</p><p>A parent’s primary instinct is to protect their children from harm.

It’s important for them to understand they are not responsible for something that was out of their control.</p><p>In the aftermath of such a distressing experience, parents are their child’s strongest pillar of support and understanding and should focus on what is in their control. As they embark on the arduous path of healing, parents play a crucial role in helping their child find solace and reclaim their sense of security.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/03/how-parents-carers-can-support-children-a-child-who-has-experienced-sexual-abuse-trauma">Continue reading...</a>
