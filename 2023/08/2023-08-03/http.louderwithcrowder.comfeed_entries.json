Last week, in the middle of the night, she was woken up by an intruder standing over her head threatening to cut her. The first thing she did was get her shoes on.</p><p>\"I thought to myself, \u2018If he\u2019s going to cut, I\u2019m going to kick.\u2019 So I jumped into my shoes.\"</p><p>He pinned her up against the wall, but she was able to grab a chair.

Then he said he was very hungry. So this woman -- who was woken up in the middle man by a pantless intruder -- gave him a snack. Crackers, peanut butter, and two things on Ensure, and some tangerines.</p><p>Still, Marjorie is no one to be trifled with.</p><p>\"Don't sit and cry about it.

Another Bud Light post?\" At this point, it's more of a morbid curiosity. Though, finding out the bulk of the <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/anheuser-busch-layoffs\" target=\"_blank\">Anheuser-Busch layoffs</a> are taking place in the sales and marketing departments of New York City came with an interesting tidbit.</p><p>Controversial titface performer Dylan Mulvaney is an easy target, but I don't fault her/him/it or they. When you get sent a bag of money to shill for Bud Light, you go get your bag. It was the philosophy about how much Bud Light executives hated their clientele that led to working with Dylan, as exposed in the <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-vice-president-marketing\" target=\"_blank\">now infamous \"fratty\" and \"out of touch\" podcast</a>. That's what caused customers to look for beers that don't hate them.</p><p>According to <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/bud-lights-issues-connecting-middle-america-could-avoided-expert-says\" target=\"_blank\">Beer Business Daily publisher Harry Schuhmacher</a>, that's what the company gets for moving its headquarters out of real America and into the most Leftist part of New York City. </p><blockquote>A-B made a conscious decision back in 2015 to move their sales and marketing functions to New York from Saint Louis, where they had been headquartered for, you know, 100 years. At the time, distributors warned them that might give them a hole in their thinking. It might give them gaps in connecting with Middle America. And sure enough, that clearly happened.</blockquote><p>They broke the cardinal rule of beer marketing in that you don't push politics or religion on people. The rub is in New York City, pushing your politics on people IS the Left's religion. Schumacher says the company started to care less about marketing beer as much as they did \"checkbox marketing,\" where coastal elites are only concerned about what other coastal elites think of them and revel in the virtue of each other's farts. Remember, it's all about the <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-bars-restaurants\" target=\"_blank\">global sales volume</a> and that sweet ESG cash.</p><blockquote>I think living in that kind of Chelsea-Manhattan bubble really does remove you from the bars and taverns, restaurants and convenience stores, and grocery stores across America. And I think it definitely does have a cultural effect that you can't really measure, but it's definitely there.</blockquote><p>Oh, you can definitely measure it. 30% loss of volume and $27 billion in market value.</p><p> But again, how did we get here? The now-former Bud Light VP Alissa Heinersceid attacked customers <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-exec-bear-market\" target=\"_blank\">from her eight-million-dollar Central Park home</a> after hiring <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/captiv8-bud-light-dylan-mulvaney\" target=\"_self\">a San Francisco-based \"influencer\" marketing firm</a> to set her up with the controversial titface performer. </p><p>There is a trend with progressives where the only way to be \"inclusive\" and \"for everyone\" is to sh*t on the people who currently enjoy a product. It's called the <a href=\"https://boundingintocomics.com/search/kathleen%2bkennedy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kathleen Kennedy</a> method. Heinersceid wanted to shed Bud Light's image of being a beer people she looks down on enjoyed.</p><p>There is a lesson to be learned here for other corporations. F*ck New York City. There is valuable and skilled talent in the normal parts of America as well, but they don't hate the people you want to sell things to.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

Los Angeles elected officials got involved to ensure that the Left's every kink was affirmed. And that you can't be \"tolerant\" unless you support men dressed like nuns mocking the crucifixion of Christ.</p><p>The more we say \"This is too far\" the more the Left digs in their heels. And drag queens are a perfect example. There have always been drag shows. Adult men would dress up like women, give themselves a double entendre for a name, tell some raunchy jokes and entertain ADULTS in bars. If that's your thing, fine.</p><p>Then minors would <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mashable-ten-year-old-drag-queen\" target=\"_self\">dress up like women and entertain adults in bars</a>. Conservatives said, \"Hey, this seems inappropriate.\"</p><p>The left doubled down with \"<a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mashable-ten-year-old-drag-queen\" target=\"_self\">Drag Queen Story Time</a>.\" Conservatives said, \"Guys, let's leave children alone because this is wrong.\"<br /></p><p>There was even a point in time when drag queens <a href=\"https://www.logotv.com/news/x87afd/scotish-pride-event-bans-drag-queens-to-avoid-offending-trans-people\" target=\"_blank\">were shunned by the left because trans people were offended</a>.</p><p>Now if you DON'T support all drag queens <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/drag-queen-uk-theme-park\" target=\"_blank\">gyrating in front of your children</a> all the time, you hate every single one of the Ls, Gs, Bs, especially the Ts, Qs, As, Is, other Is, Ps, and whatever the hell the +s are.</p><p>Cheers to Schroder for having the courage to speak out. I'm sure it fell on the deaf ears of the city council, but the rest of us are listening.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

Either that or Newsom can go back to attacking Fox News as a right-wing echo chamber.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SKMorefield/status/1686917097991860224\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Let\u2019s get it done.

We need to reverse.</blockquote><p>To quote a popular saying out on these streets, this is tribal combat now!</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"7783e\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=34777122&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>Before I go any further, cards on the table:</p><ol><li>I, personally, as an individual primary voter, am all-in for DeSantis.</li><li>With my caps lock button on, I WILL SUPPORT WHOEVER GETS THE NOMINATION AND IS RUNNING AGAINST BIDEN. </li></ol><p>As long as I still have a choice, DeSantis is my dude. Okay? Okay.</p><p>I love this and hope it happens. The way we run presidential debates is stupid (more on that in a bit). Seeing two people go 1-on-1 is more valuable to the American people. Especially in this case where the two people are evenly matched (two governors who are much younger than their mid-70s) and represent the two polar opposite ideologies in America. Each candidate has a state where their policies based on those ideologies have been put into action. It's idea vs idea, record vs record.</p><p>I'd be okay if the GOP primary debates instead of a stage with eleventy-five people on it, were a series of 1-on-1 debates. Unlike when the RNC started doing primary debates, we have an internet now. All you need are two candidates, a moderator, and WiFi. Though still with metrics to decide WHO gets to debate. No one should be stuck talking to <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tucker-carlson-asa-hutchinson\" target=\"_blank\">Asa Hutchinson</a>.</p><p>Plus the way the GOP debates are now is a mess. Donald Trump, much like Joe Biden being afraid to debate Robert Kennedy Jr., believes since he is ahead in public opinion polls (many conducted by the fake news media) five months before the first vote is cast, he doesn't owe it to the American people to address his positions in a public forum and be challenged on his record. It is what it is.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brodigan/status/1687056710890815489\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But when Trump does show up to that first debate, the first half hour (at least) of it is going to be about him and all his drama, ending with a stupid \"raise your hands if you [solve for x]\" question. When the focus is on issues or the bad parts of the former president's record, other candidates have a chance to shine. When the focus is on Trump, Trump wins (in a primary). </p><p>DeSantis needs to start having breakout moments. He's my dude, but I also have functioning eyes and can read numbers that have a percentage sign after them. Going one-on-one against his polar opposite -- and a guy who could be the Democrat nominee after Jill Biden gets tired of committing senior abuse -- and winning, creates momentum. Momentum creates votes.</p><p>The downfall of going 1-on-1 is that if he loses or otherwise sh*ts the bed, that's it.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"ec604\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=34777183&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>It is time to disrupt the process and try new things. A DeSantis vs Newsom, no hold barred, 1-on-1 debate is a perfect way to start.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.
