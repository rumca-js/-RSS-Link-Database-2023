  <p id="4cY9qs">“Every single one” of Amazon’s businesses has “multiple generative AI initiatives going right now,” Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said on the company’s Q2 2023 earnings call on Thursday. The company offers <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/inferentia/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">infrastructure</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/26/23808730/aws-generative-ai-agents-healthcare-privacy">services</a> via AWS that can help power many generative artificial intelligence applications, which Jassy did discuss on the call, but he also stressed just how important AI is across the company as a whole.</p>
<p id="c3V46L">Here’s more from Jassy about those generative AI initiatives:</p>
<blockquote><p id="TtNIhM">They range from things that help us be more cost-effective and streamlined in how we run operations and various businesses, to the absolute heart of every customer experience in which we offer.

  <p id="Yeudy9">This April through June quarter is almost always Apple’s most boring financial stretch of the entire year, and <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/08/apple-reports-third-quarter-results/">today’s earnings release</a> shows this year was no exception. The company reported revenue of $81.8 billion, down from $83 billion last year. With the new iPhone 15 series still a month and change away, last year’s lineup is sagging in consumer demand somewhat and was down 2 percent compared to a year ago. That’s not terrible considering how close we are to a new refresh. “The smartphone industry is tough in the US right now,” Apple CEO Tim Cook <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/03/apple-earnings-live-updates.html">told CNBC</a>.  </p>

  <p id="sYgb4n">Three of Reddit’s biggest communities are no longer focused entirely on John Oliver in a form of protest against Reddit. The subreddits had made the switch in June to push back on Reddit’s API pricing that ultimately made some popular third-party apps shut down, but now, they’re operating pretty much as they did before the protests.</p>
<p id="pEty8B">One of the subreddits, r/aww (which has more than 34 million subscribers), posted a long explanation for the change. While the r/aww community did vote “overwhelmingly” for the John Oliver rule, “it was never intended to be permanent,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/15dv7hp/farewell_to_the_john_oliver_rule_and_reddit_coins/">a moderator wrote in the post</a>, which was published earlier this week. “More than a month has passed, and as things on the internet go, the passion for the protest has waned and...</p>

Speaking during the <a href="https://youtu.be/QgK0vCHZAIk?t=526">company’s latest community update</a>, Nothing CEO Carl Pei said that the company’s new “CMF by Nothing” brand aims to offer “a new range of products that make better design more accessible.” </p>

<p id="KxfMNG">Despite this, the executives at Warner Bros. Discovery don’t seem too worried. During an earnings call, the company’s chief financial officer, Gunnar Wiedenfels, attributed the downward trend to “overlapping subscriber bases between Max and Discovery Plus” as well as “expected churn” following the end of <em>The Last of Us</em> season 1 and the series finale of <em>Succession</em>.</p>

  <p id="m63QYw">Waymo’s fourth robotaxi city will be Austin, Texas. It will be a bit of a homecoming for the Alphabet-owned self-driving company. </p>
<p id="mh7Hw1">Waymo said that it will kick off the process for a commercial robotaxi service in the city later this year. But that doesn’t mean passengers can hail one of the company’s driverless vehicles quite yet; Waymo’s playbook is to start with manual testing, following by supervised testing, fully autonomous driving, and then, eventually, passenger services. The company has been testing its vehicles on the streets of Austin <a href="https://waymo.com/blog/2023/03/expanding-waymos-testing-to-Austin.html">since March</a>, laying the groundwork for the eventual launch of a commercial ridehailing service. </p>
<p id="2oktJy">But the company’s history with the city stretches all the way back to October 2015, when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20882724/ford-autonomous-cars-vehicles-av-austin-texas-taxi-delivery">Waymo gave...</a></p>

  <p id="hlwn5A">LG’s eye-catching 97-inch Signature OLED M TV, which is almost completely free of wires save for a single power cord, finally has a price and release date outside of South Korea. </p>
<p id="XLLMC4">The TV is notable for its “Zero Connect Box,” that you plug your set-top boxes, games consoles, and Blu-ray players into and which beams content wirelessly to the TV at up to 4K 120Hz. So aside from power, you’re not plugging anything into the TV itself.</p>
<p id="utqLsW">LG says the 97-inch OLED Signature (model 97M3) will be available in the UK from September priced at £27,999.99 (about $35,400). It’ll be joined by two other TV sizes, the 83-inch OLED evo for £7,999.99 (about $10,000) and the 77-inch OLED evo for £5,999.99 (about $7,600), which are equipped with the same “Zero...</p>

  <p id="YI8HjD">Microsoft has accidentally leaked its internal “StagingTool” app that is used by employees to enable secret unreleased Windows 11 features. The software giant typically <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/3/22916118/microsoft-new-windows-11-features-experiment-test">tests experimental or hidden Windows 11 features</a> in public builds of the operating system, but Windows enthusiasts have until now had to rely on third-party tools to get access to secret features that Microsoft hasn’t yet enabled for all testers.</p>
<p id="FGzOl4">The accidental release of Microsoft’s StagingTool yesterday was part of the company’s “bug bash” event this week, where engineers encourage feedback from Windows 11 testers to squash any remaining bugs before a big update. Microsoft is expected to deliver its next <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/23/23734625/microsoft-windows-11-rar-support-native">big Windows 11 update in September</a>, including native support for...</p>

Its prebuilt Aurora desktop PC needs work, particularly in the cooling department. So the new Alienware Aurora R16 is laser-focused on fixing that — to the point the company is largely ditching its trademark out-of-this-world look.</p>
<p id="j6lKaH">The new Aurora R16 has largely the same basic steel chassis inside, with the same 25.2 liters of space for your components. But its boxy new design ditches <em>multiple pounds</em> of plastic to make the entire computer 40 percent smaller in volume — shrinking all the way down from 60.7 liters to 36 liters in total. </p>

<p id="50JMC4">In the UFC zone, you’ll be able to watch 4K, 180-degree streams of fights, socialize with other players about UFC, see a virtual recreation of the Octagon, and compete in in-world games to get “exclusive unlockable rewards” and eventually become “a UFC Hall of Famer.” It’s set to launch sometime in November.</p>
