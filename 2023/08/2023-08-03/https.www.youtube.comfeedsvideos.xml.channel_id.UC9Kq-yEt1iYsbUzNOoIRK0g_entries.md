#SuperEasyBarelyAnInconvenience

Original Description: 

The Last Jedi has stormed into theaters. The film is certainly one of the most complex films set in a galaxy far, far away so you’ll be forgiven if you didn’t catch everything on the first viewing. There’s a ton going on in the background that you may not have even noticed and we’re here to help you find them. For example, did you catch that Rey stole the Jedi books? Blink and you’ll miss it! Luke’s final reveal was actually telegraphed well in advanced in a masterful way. Supreme Leader Snoke actually has a piece of bling that harkens back to Rogue One! Speaking of bling, what were those dice that we saw a few times? Luke has a stash of trinkets at the tree on Ahch-To, one of them ties directly to Star Wars Battlefront 2 while another may be a reference to the beloved Knights of the Old Republic video games. We get our first look, sort of, at the first Jedi while at the temple with Luke and Rey. Did you think Rian Johnson forgot about the famous line “I have a bad feeling about this?” Think again! We got to see the old X Wing used in a very interesting way and get a call back to a character from Rogue One in the form of a ship. Of course, being Star Wars, there are a ton of cameos in the film that you likely didn’t catch either, some of them being quite obvious! So strap in for the video and enjoy the ride!
