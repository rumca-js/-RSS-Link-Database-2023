Why might there be sudden interest in Shakespeare\u2019s study of someone who ruthlessly pursues power and then proves unsuited to it? To even up casting opportunity, most classical stagings now ignore the old code of M (male) and F (female) roles. The approach here, though, is less gender-neutral than gender-pointed. Director Abigail Graham makes the witches not weird sisters but a trio of sinister brothers wearing full hazmat suits and birds-of-prey masks.</p><p>Atmospherically, Macbeth is Shakespeare\u2019s darkest play \u2013 there is comment on the sun\u2019s reluctance to rise \u2013 but at the open-air Globe, even in a dull summer, this short play is almost wholly day-lit. Darkness must descend in other ways. Aaron Anthony finds the full shock and horror in the tricky lines where Macduff learns his family\u2019s fate, and fight director Bret Yount contrives unnervingly convincing murders.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/03/macbeth-review-max-bennetts-jokey-king-is-clearly-unfit-to-govern\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/03/macbeth-review-max-bennetts-jokey-king-is-clearly-unfit-to-govern", "date_published": "2023-08-03T14:00:45+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "She escaped her husband\u2019s physical violence \u2013 but economic ties kept them connected for years", "description": "<p>Dialogue around \u2018coercive control\u2019 in relation to financial abuse is gaining steam in the US, with California passing laws to protect victims from collectors</p><p>The bankruptcy lawyer spread all of Jean\u2019s debts across the table.

Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) is desperately trying to shimmy her way into a full-body, horse saddle-sized strap-on. Her partner, Che Diaz (Sara Ramirez), is sprawled across the bed with their T-shirt still on, casually watching in the way you might a sports channel.

Maybe it\u2019s because Che Diaz is so profoundly grating that you can\u2019t believe Miranda would be, quite literally, bending herself backwards for them. Maybe it\u2019s because, as a person of lesbian experience, I know that there is absolutely no need for a strap-on that mathematical and complex.

The Australian company\u2019s director since 2021 is David Hallberg, a former star dancer of American Ballet Theatre and the first American principal at the Bolshoi. Conquering Balanchine is a marker of a company\u2019s technical achievements. It inevitably invites comparisons to the New York City Ballet dancers, who have this style drilled into them from childhood, but great choreography stands up to differing interpretations.</p><p>A shameless corporate tie-in, 1967\u2019s Jewels came out of a meeting between Balanchine and jewellers Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, both looking to boost their brands. Scatter the stage design (by Peter Harvey) and costumes (Barbara Karinska) with glittering gems, and you\u2019ve got a very pretty scene. But it\u2019s also a journey through different dance eras, French Romanticism in Emeralds, set to Faur\u00e9; Tchaikovsky and the classicism of imperial Russia in Diamonds; and the disjointed dazzle of early 20th-century New York in Rubies, soundtracked by Stravinsky.<br /><br />On the musical front, the Royal Ballet Sinfonia are on top form under Australian Ballet\u2019s musical director (and regular Covent Garden conductor) Jonathan Lo. Their opening chords of Emeralds are played with sublime delicacy as the curtain rises to reveal the dancers in absinthe-coloured tulle. Emeralds is a ballet of soft hands and endless <em>bourr\u00e9es</em> that could easily glide past you, but you can also focus in on the details. Valerie Tereshchenko dances as if suspended in a dream state, in motion like soundlessly scudding clouds, with graceful attention to the movement of her head and neck.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/03/the-australian-ballet-jewels-review-lots-of-glitter-but-no-gold\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/03/the-australian-ballet-jewels-review-lots-of-glitter-but-no-gold", "date_published": "2023-08-03T11:50:20+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "The Brief Life & Mysterious Death of Boris III, King of Bulgaria review \u2013 a monarch\u2019s missing morals", "description": "<p><strong>Pleasance Dome, Edinburgh</strong><br />Wittily drawn historical drama follows self-effacing leader ill-equipped to deal with the encroaching Nazi menace</p><p>If you think actor Joseph Cullen is cartoonish at the start of this chewy true-life story, you should see the grotesque caricature he becomes.

This is a tradition as British as drinking tea or Morris dancing. When the economy tanked after the 1720 \u201cSouth Sea bubble\u201d collapse, the so-called Black Act was passed, imposing the death penalty on the overwhelmingly poor Britons driven by hunger who poached animals in private parks in order to survive. Today\u2019s justice system spares offenders the gallows, but it\u2019s driven by the same class vengeance that defined it back then: witness how you\u2019re <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/welfare/2021/02/new-you-re-23-times-more-likely-be-prosecuted-benefit-fraud-tax-fraud-uk\">23 times more likely</a> to be prosecuted for benefit fraud than tax fraud, even though the latter costs the economy nine times more.</p><p>The Tories\u2019 plan to cling on to power is now abundantly clear: appeal to the worst instincts of the electorate. Proffering mandatory prison sentences as a solution to persistent shoplifting is part of that grim package. In practice, that means scooping up more largely poor, often traumatised citizens, and locking them up in institutions so overcrowded that their staff\u2019s trade union <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/prison-overcrowding-figures-disorder-sentences-b2342257.html\">describes them as</a> a \u201cpowder keg waiting to blow\u201d. That shoplifting is indelibly linked to poverty is beyond debate.

Then there was The Dropout, about Elizabeth Holmes, currently in jail for defrauding those who invested in her bloodtesting company, which could not do the things it claimed.
