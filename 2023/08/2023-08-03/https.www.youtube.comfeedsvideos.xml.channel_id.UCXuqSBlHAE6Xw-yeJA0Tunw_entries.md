Alienware is the out-of-this-world system integrator that produces, monitors, keyboards, gaming PCs and well, a whole lot more. While we've been super positive on their QD-OLED gaming monitors how is the rest of their lineup? Their Gaming Prebuilt, Aurora R15, was maligned by the DIY community, but maybe their fully redesigned Aurora R16? With an Intel Core i7-13700F CPU an NVIDIA RTX 4070, it just might be a good setup. Only one way to find out.
