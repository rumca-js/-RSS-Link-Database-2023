Unfortunately, it's just the Wizard that has access to this mechanic. If you're interested in learning more spells but you're not a Wizard, you can always choose to multiclass and gain access to the ability that way. Of course, that comes with its own pros and cons, so it's up to you to decide if it's worth it or not.

For instance, you can <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-save-arabella-kagha-guide/1100-6515890/\"><strong>rescue Arabella from Kagha</strong></a>, while also learning that the latter is working with the Shadow Druids.</li><li>The important task here is to find the whereabouts of Halsin, the Arch Druid, as he seems to know a cure for the parasite. You'll find him in the Goblin Camp/Shattered Sanctum. He's imprisoned in bear form, but you can bust him out. Be forewarned that making him accompany you inside the dungeon will make all cultists hostile.</li><li>The Paladin Minthara is one of the leaders of the Cult of the Absolute. You can certainly side with her during the assault, as this decision allows you to <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-minthara-romance-guide/1100-6515891/\"><strong>romance Minthara</strong></a>. However, that means the Tieflings and Druids will die.

Currently, there's a limit to how Stasis is unlocked, as you'd have to do several lengthy bounties to earn the currency needed to purchase your desired Aspect or Fragment, a process that takes weeks of work <em>per Guardian</em>.</p><figure style=\"width: 1024px;\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4173640-d-qol-1.jpg\"><img alt=\"Finally, a resources tab.\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4173640-d-qol-1.jpg\" /></a><figcaption>Finally, a resources tab.</figcaption></figure><figure><div class=\"image-gallery__label\">Gallery</div>   <div class=\"image-gallery__list hide-scrollbar image-gallery__list--small\">       <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4173641-d-qol-2.jpg\">       <img alt=\"Gallery image 1\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4173641-d-qol-2.jpg\" />     </a>       <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4173642-d-qol-3.jpg\">       <img alt=\"Gallery image 2\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4173642-d-qol-3.jpg\" />     </a>       <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4173643-d-qol-4.jpg\">       <img alt=\"Gallery image 3\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4173643-d-qol-4.jpg\" />     </a>   </div>  </figure><p>Bungie hasn't detailed which resources you'll need to complete your Stasis collection, but if the process is similar to how you purchase Light 3.0 Aspects and Fragments from Ikora Rey, you'll probably be able to slip Elsie some Glimmer to get the goods.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-is-finally-making-it-easier-to-unlock-all-your-stasis-abilities-from-season-22/1100-6516550/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-is-finally-making-it-easier-to-unlock-all-your-stasis-abilities-from-season-22/1100-6516550/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-08-03T18:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Baldur's Gate 3 - How To Romance Shadowheart", "description": "<p>There are many companions that you can romance in <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/\">Baldur's Gate 3</a>.

Despite being a follower of Shar, she actually prefers kind and compassionate actions, as well as using your wiles to trick enemies (i.e. Persuasion and Deception). Early on, she's also at odds with Lae'zel, so make sure you respond to certain suggestions accordingly.</li><li>Eventually, Shadowheart will open up about her true nature, as well as what her artifact is for. Even though Shar is feared by most citizens in Faerun, you have to remain welcoming and accepting. This will lead to a scene where her past is revealed.</li></ul><figure style=\"width: 1280px;\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4173446-baldurs-gate-3-shadowheart-romance-guide-1.jpg\"><img alt=\"Be accepting of Shadowheart after she admits that she worships Shar.\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4173446-baldurs-gate-3-shadowheart-romance-guide-1.jpg\" /></a><figcaption>Be accepting of Shadowheart after she admits that she worships Shar.</figcaption></figure><h3>Potential First Kiss With Shadowheart</h3><p>During the early access period, the Baldur's Gate 3 Shadowheart romance simply meant being in good standing with her, and <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-save-tiefling-refugees-druid-grove/1100-6516508/\"><strong>saving the Tiefling refugees</strong></a>.

After a Witch Queen revamp last year, the PvPvE mode has largely remained the same and is mostly used as an outlet to check off challenges throughout a season in exchange for some quick experience points. Heading into <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-season-22-storyline-weapons-and-everything-we-know/1100-6515517/\">Season 22</a>, not much is changing here, but Bungie is aiming to make some updates to it when The Final Shape expansion launches.</p><p>These changes include porting the Cathedral of Scars map into mode and adding in new enemy types--Shadow Legion and Lucent Hive--to slightly shake Gambit up. The biggest change coming before The Final Shape will see Gambit turned into an entirely optional pursuit. <a href=\"https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/state_of_the_game_aug_2023\">Bungie says</a> that Gambit will continue to serve as a source of Exotic engrams via weekly challenges, but starting in Season 22, all weekly challenges can be completed in any ritual. That means that you'll be able to farm just Vanguard Ops or PvP to complete these challenges, leaving you room to ignore Gambit entirely if you want.</p><p>The number of Gambit-specific Seasonal Challenges starting in Season 22 are also being reduced, but this mode will still offer some gear that's specific to it. Bungie added that it'll be adding Fireteam Matchmaking to Gambit next Season, which will replace the Freelance node and should result in faster and better matchmaking by combining both Gambit playlists. Lastly, Season 22 will see a new Void Machine Gun available to earn exclusively in Gambit, so there'll be at least one reason to visit the Drifter when the next season begins.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-plans-to-make-destiny-2-gambit-mode-even-more-irrelevant-from-season-22-onwards/1100-6516546/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-plans-to-make-destiny-2-gambit-mode-even-more-irrelevant-from-season-22-onwards/1100-6516546/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-08-03T17:33:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Baldur's Gate 3 Soul Coins Locations", "description": "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/\">Baldur's Gate 3</a> Soul Coins are unique items that you can find during your travels.

Developed by legendary studio Treasure, the game is famous for its high difficulty, its color-based scoring system, and for the fact that it was only available on the Sega Saturn for many years. As its <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2450820/Radiant_Silvergun/\">Steam page</a> reveals, Radiant Silvergun is coming to PC soon. Though the page doesn't have a firm release date, the below trailer says it's coming August 18.</p><div>          </div><p dir=\"ltr\">Radiant Silvergun first came to modern consoles back in 2011, when it was re-released for the Xbox 360, and it was also ported to the Nintendo Switch last year. Based on the game's Steam trailer, it seems that the PC version will be based on the Switch release, though that hasn't been stated for sure. These re-releases included several aspects that the original Saturn version lacked, including scoring leaderboards, optional improved graphics, and a revised scoring system based on its spiritual successor, Ikaruga.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Ikaruga is also considered one of the best shmups of all time, and it's been available on Steam since 2014. Some of the more acclaimed shmups currently available on PC include <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/809020/ZeroRanger/\">ZeroRanger</a>, <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/439490/BLUE_REVOLVER/\">Blue Revolver</a>, and <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/464450/DoDonPachi_Resurrection/\">DoDonPachi Resurrection</a>.

The judge rejected Bungie's request, ruling that since the fourth defendant was \"not an original developer of the software or an original participant in the Ring-1 enterprise\" and had a role similar to that of a \"customer service representative,\" they would not have to pay any damages.</p><p>In the new lawsuit against Ring-1, Bungie is pursuing 10 named defendants and 40 \"John Does\" in its case. <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-wins-lawsuit-against-another-cheat-distributor-for-12-million/1100-6513797/\">Bungie's previous court cases against cheat-makers</a> have set new legal precedents, and it says that those lawsuits \"have repeatedly confirmed that the sale and use of cheat software violates a raft of federal and state laws, breaches users' contracts with Bungie (the Limited Software License Agreement that users accept to gain access to Destiny 2) and is a basis for significant tort liability.\"</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-says-the-days-of-destiny-2-cheat-makers-are-numbered/1100-6516529/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-says-the-days-of-destiny-2-cheat-makers-are-numbered/1100-6516529/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-08-03T14:08:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "1 Billion Switch Games Have Now Been Sold, Top 10 Best-Sellers Revealed", "description": "<p>As part of Nintendo's latest financial briefing, the company updated its list of the top-selling Switch games of all time, and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe continues to reign supreme.
