You wont believe this but everything went to plan today! Really happy that my understanding of how CAD translates to IRL have improved this much. 

Lego Kit! :)

The prototype is designed to answer the age old question: Can I play tight music using a very strong flywheel? The new flywheel have 20x more moment of inertia compared to the MMX Flywheel.

We are recording at the wonderful location of Siegfrieds Mechanical Music Museum in Rudesheim Am Rhein, Germany. The museum will livestream the upcoming Wintergatan meetup 4-6 august on their youtube channel, check it out here: https://www.youtube.com/@Musikkabinett
