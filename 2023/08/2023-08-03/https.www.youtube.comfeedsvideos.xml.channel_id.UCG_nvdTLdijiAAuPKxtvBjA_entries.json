You got the director of Iron Man, Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, Steven Spielberg, Ron Howard... just to name a few. This should've been a successful hit, yet it turned out to be a massive flop that tanked at the box office and ensured no future instalments were made. And the main reason could be in the large sum of its parts. There is so much here that there is nothing here, because the movie lacks specifcity. We have cowboys as well as aliens, yet we have nothing. In today's episode of Anatomy of a Failure, let's try to see why and how to ensure the same doesn't happen to our movie.\n\nBook, Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BW1TN97D?ref_=pe_3052080_276849420\nBook, PDF: email me at saltyfilmento(a)gmail.com\n\nSupport:     https://patreon.com/filmento\nFollow:        https://twitter.com/filmento\nFilmento en Espa\u00f1ol: https://youtu.be/ViDZUofaZd8\n\n#Cowboysandaliens #danielcraig   #anatomyofafailure\n\nMusic:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@WhiteBatAudio\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@NanoverseProductions\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@AimToHeadOfficial\n\n\n-\nCowboys & Aliens (2011)\nBased on the graphic novel by Scott Mitchell Rosenberg, Cowboys & Aliens is set in 1800s Arizona, where the local cowboys, headed by gunslinger Jake Lonergan (Daniel Craig), and the indigenous Apache tribe have been feuding fiercely for quite a while. Their skirmish is interrupted, however, by the appearance of a spaceship, commanded by an alien creature that's bent on enslaving the human race. It's time for a six-gun shoot-out between these cattle rustlers and space invaders, and there might even be a temporary peace between the cowboys and Indians as they both take aim at these extraterrestrial uninvited guests. Jon Favreau directs from a script by Star Trek scribes Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, with help from Lost's Damon Lindelof. Olivia Wilde, Harrison Ford, and Sam Rockwell fill out the headlining cast.\n-\nIron Man (2008)\nFrom Marvel Studios and Paramount Pictures comes Iron Man, an action-packed take on the tale of wealthy philanthropist Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), who develops an invulnerable robotic suit to fight the throes of evil. In addition to being filthy rich, billionaire industrialist Tony Stark is also a genius inventor. When Stark is kidnapped and forced to build a diabolical weapon, he instead uses his intelligence and ingenuity to construct an indestructible suit of armor and escape his captors.
