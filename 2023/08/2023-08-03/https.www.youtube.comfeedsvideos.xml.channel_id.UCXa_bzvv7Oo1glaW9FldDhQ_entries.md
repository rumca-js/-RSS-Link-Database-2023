So far in our recap of the entire Mortal Kombat franchise, across the first two parts, we've covered the original trilogy, which culminates with Shao Kahn and his forces of Outworld invading Earthrealm, only to be driven back and defeated by Liu Kang, Raiden, and co. Here, in part three, we're going to move ahead to the next phase of the franchise, which kicks off a new arc and introduces a new main villain for the heroes to contend with. 

After the defeat of Shao Kahn in Mortal Kombat 3, Mortal Kombat 4 turns its attentions to a new central threat: Shinnok- but before we get into the events of the game itself, we first need to turn the clock back a little bit and talk about Shinnok himself, and about how he got to the point where we find him in Mortal Kombat 4.

FromSoftware has established itself as one of the most prestigious and consistent developers in the industry by now, and even though its next game is going to be quite different from the sort of experiences it did that on the back of, it still warrants plenty of attention- which, of course, it has been getting in spades. 

Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon has generated its fair share of buzz and excitement in the build up to its release later this month, and as we count the days down to the day it launches, there continues to be no shortage of things to talk about. To that end, here, weâ€™re going to go over a few more key details that you should know about the game.
