Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Kellie-Jay Keen, AKA Posie Parker, discuss her rude awakening as a women’s rights activist, the irony of arguing for women’s rights against transgender “women,” the censorship now abundant across leading streaming platforms, and why those speaking out continue to do so against all odds.

Kellie-Jay Keen is a women’s rights activist and founder of the group “Standing For Women.” Her group events, #LetWomenSpeak, became so popular in the UK that Keen launched a world tour which has greatly influenced international discourse on the transgender movement and the importance of preserving women’s spaces and affordances.
