  <p id="YoHYB1">Chinese giant Baidu officially launched its chatbot, Ernie Bot, after the government approved its application, alongside that of several other AI companies. </p>
<p id="CdcbtC">Ernie Bot is now available for download from app stores or Baidu’s <a href="https://yiyan.baidu.com/">website</a>. Much like its main rival, ChatGPT, users can ask Ernie Bot questions or prompt it to help write market analysis, give marketing slogan ideas, and summarize documents. People need to log in to their Baidu accounts to use Ernie Bot, but it’s unclear if the platform is available globally. The Baidu app is available on US Android and iOS app stores but is only in Chinese. </p>

  <p id="KuqZcs">Home projector upstart Xgimi just announced its new Horizon Ultra model, dubbed the “world’s first 4K long-throw projector with Dolby Vision.” While I wouldn’t hold out too much hope for the device to produce an image with jaw-dropping HDR, it’s certainly a very bright all-in-one Android TV 11 projector for well below $2,000.</p>
<p id="gT78La">The Horizon Ultra uses a new “Dual Light” laser and LED hybrid light source to produce 2,300 ISO lumens.
