Singer-songwriter Nikki Lane gets the crowd to be her rhythm section on "Jackpot."

Lane visited Minneapolis to perform a solo acoustic set of songs and stories, drawing from her latest album, 'Denim & Diamonds' (out on @NewWestRecords ) as well as selections from her previous releases — plus a new song that's in the works. This session was recorded live at Icehouse, an intimate music club located along the Eat Street section of Nicollet Avenue in Minneapolis.
