Bethesda's spacefaring adventure has its moments with an impressive scale, satisfying combat, and some worthwhile sidequests, but its shallow RPG systems and uninspired vision of the cosmos make for a journey that's a mile wide, but an inch deep.

After over 10 years since the release of New Super Mario Bros. U, Nintendo is finally releasing a new 2D iteration of Mario in Super Mario Bros. Wonder. 

Rather than the traditional Mushroom Kingdom, Super Mario Bros. Wonder instead takes place in the Flower Kingdom - home of the Wonder Flower. Of course, while Mario, Peach, and friends are visiting the kingdom - Bowser interrupts wrecking havoc.

Once your adventure starts, Mario Wonder will let you take care of plenty of characters from the Mushroom Kingdom, including Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, two Toads, Toadette, four Yoshi's, and Nabbit. Mario Wonder seems to be a true step forward for the 2D Mario franchise, and the most major step since Super Mario World.

For more info on the Flower Kingdom, new enemies like Bloomps and Skedaddles, and what Wonder Flowers will mean for your journey - check out our full preview right here, written by Steve Watts.
