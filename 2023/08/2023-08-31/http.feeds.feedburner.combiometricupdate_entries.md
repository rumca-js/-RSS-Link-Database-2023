		The biometric payment card bundle from <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/idex-asa">Idex Biometrics</a> made up of a sensor from Idex, a payments module with a secure element, a card inlay and an operating system has earned a Conformity Compliance Statement (CCS) from Mastercard.

The approval gives Idex full Mastercard certification, according to the company announcement. The step is the final one in Mastercard’s Compliance Assessment and Security Testing (CAST). Manufacturers can use this certification to obtain Letter of Approval (LoA) without going through their own compliance tests, making time to market faster and less expensive, Idex explains. The biometrics developers’ latest sensor passed Mastercard’s <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/2023

		Afenifere, a socio-political organization working on behalf of the Yoruba people in Nigeria, believes using biometrics during Nigeria’s planned population census will enhance the accuracy of the census outcome.

As part of their discussion during a meeting held in Ondo state on August 30, members of the Pan-Yoruba group said the federal government must consider using biometrics as it does with voter registration, according to a statement from the group seen by <em>Biometric Update</em>.

“The meeting took note of the census coming up next year. It was noted that the biometric method was successfully used for Voter Card registration.” Afenifere has therefore called on the federal government to make the National Population Commission “use the same biometric m

		U.S. officials say they want to temporarily make it legal for people to use a mobile driver's license even if it doesn't comply with REAL ID rules after 2025 when physical state IDs are mandated to comply.

REAL ID is a federal standard for what every state must put on licenses in order to make forgeries and fraud more readily apparent. Deadlines to impose the standards have been repeatedly postponed, often because of local-vs.-federal <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202203/alaska-bill-proposes-repeal-of-real-id-to-offer-non-biometric-drivers-licenses">control arguments</a>.

		Australia’s Albanese government has opted out of imposing a mandatory age verification regime for online pornography and other adult content, citing the immaturity of current technology options. The government will instead rely on forthcoming online safety codes.

On March 31, 2023, the eSafety Commissioner submitted the <a href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/about-us/consultation-cooperation/age-verification">Roadmap for Age Verification</a> to the Australian Government. The roadmap explores if and how a mandatory age verification mechanism or similar could practically be achieved in Australia and considers additional measures to prevent and mitigate harm to children from online pornography. This roadmap is the outcome of almost two years of work by the Office of

A key component of this immersion is the integration of seamless payment methods, which allow players to purchase in-game items, upgrade their characters, or access premium content without breaking the flow of their gaming session. As we stand on the brink of introducing biometric methods for a robust and unobtrusive experience, how do current payment systems function?

		The UK government is asking for information about new facial recognition technology even as a major manufacturers' association demands clarity on who has oversight over the nation's security industry.

Both events occurred August 30 and illustrate the unease each actor feels about getting more biometric surveillance on public settings. Government doesn't want to answer for more terrorism and crime and the industry doesn't want to be brought to court because it answered government's call.

An agency with the Defense Ministry, the Defense and Security Accelerator, had <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/facial-recognition">asked to hear</a> about new effective and ethical facial recognition technologies. Conceivably, that could include har

		A hacktivist group says it has breached a software system that the Iranian authorities have allegedly been using to surveil the country’s citizens, including a facial recognition tool for video surveillance.

The group, called GhostSec, has exposed approximately 26GB of data, including source code.

Among the exposed pieces of software is Behnama, a video surveillance system with facial recognition capabilities. The system was initially deployed across branches of Pasargad Bank. The software has since been used by other companies.

“Behnama is not just a tool; it is a powerful instrument of surveillance,” GhostSec <a href="https://t.me/iran_EXPOSED" rel="noopener" target="_blank">writes</a> on its Telegram channel. “It is being actively used by the Iranian government
