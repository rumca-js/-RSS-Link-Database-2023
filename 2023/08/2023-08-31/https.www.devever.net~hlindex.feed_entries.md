<p>Nexuses are an underrecognised utility in computing, despite the fact that they
are commonly used and absolutely essential to usable computer systems. A nexus,
broadly, is some sort of infrastructural system which is consumed by many
different applications written by many different people. Many of these might be
called “platforms”, but there are plenty of nexuses which would not be called
platforms.</p>

<p>Today, on the 4th of November, 2015, the UK government published its draft
Investigatory Powers Bill. The bill in terms of its introduction by the home
secretary in Parliament, as well as in terms of a few bullet points it boasts
like judicial signoff of warrants, is wrapped in and designed to exude a
certain degree of reasonability. This is all to distract, of course, from its
eminent and extreme unreasonability.</p>

<p>I previously wrote about <a href="https://www.devever.net/~hl/nexuses">nexuses</a>. One pattern I've noticed with

scripting languages, shells) with regard to their native nexus.</p>

<p>I have a great ambivalence about the Bourne shell. It is universally available
on any Unix system, and thus is one of the only truly portable, universal ways
of expressing behaviour in a Turing-complete language, such that it is
executable on UNIX without regard to architecture, binary executable formats,
ABIs, what other shells or scripting languages are available, etc. (This
property sees it used somewhat byzantinely in tools such as the <code>makeself</code>
self-extracting archive generator, where binary data is appended to a Bourne
shell script. Not a lot of options.)</p>

<p>There's a pattern in the design of libraries which I've come to call “zero-g
design”. A zero-g library is a library which only communicates with the wider
system via interfaces provided by the consumer of the library. Default
implementations may be provided which interface with the OS, but these can be
overridden. Additionally, globals are not used.</p>

<p>One of the weird things about adopting a coding style is its psychological
impact. I can't describe how significant that impact is. In some ways, it's
about creating your own language within a language and coming to feel familiar
in it. In some ways, it's having enough trust in your own consistent use of
the style that you trust the information conveyed by that style completely
when reading and reasoning about code.</p>

<p>I still use Windows 7 to the extent that I use Windows. When Microsoft released
Windows 8, a major change to the OS was the introduction of Metro-style
applications. With this change, they also introduced a code signing requirement
for such applications. This restriction saw surprisingly little reporting; the
Secure Boot panic probably distracted a lot of attention, and the fact that
barely anybody actually wants to use Metro applications probably helped.</p>

ISA whose instruction set was never published. The AS/400 line, which was
subsequently renamed to “eServer iSeries” and then to IBM i, was subsequently
migrated to PowerPC RISC CPUs. The hardware was unified into the IBM Power
Servers line, so that the IBM i operating system now runs exclusively on
vanilla IBM Power Servers along with Linux, AIX, etc.</p>

<p>A common myth about USB keyboards is that they can only support 6-key rollover,
and not report more than 6 keys being pressed at a time. In fact, this is
wholly untrue; the USB HID device class can support full N-key rollover (NKRO).
While keyboards which purport to support USB NKRO are now common, some of them
have the ability to “disable” NKRO for compatibility reasons. This is peculiar
and unnecessary and USB HID in no way requires it.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction.</strong> SCSI is an I/O subsystem architecture to allow I/O
peripherals to be attached to a system. It has over the years been used to
attach devices such as hard disk drives, SSDs, floppy drives, optical drives,
tape drives, media changers (for e.g. optical or tape media), RAID controllers
and storage enclosures containing other SCSI devices. In the past it has also
been used to attach scanners, printers and network interfaces. Today, it is
primarily used to attach hard drives, SSDs, optical drives, tape drives and
devices which support these (like medium changers for tape drives, RAID
controllers and storage enclosures). Other applications, such as scanners,
printers and network interfaces have long since moved to interfaces like USB or
PCI(e). SCSI itself evolved from, and is substantially influenced by, the
channel I/O system of IBM System/360 mainframes.</p>

replace some parts of it (but not others) with C code as you gradually
understand more of the binary.</p>

<p><strong>Industry trends: serial memory attachment.</strong> One of the most interesting
things which will happen in the near future in computing is the adoption of
serial memory interfaces. For pretty much the entire history of modern
computing, RAM has been attached to a system via a high-speed parallel
interface. Making parallel interfaces fast is hard and requires extremely
rigorous control of timing skew between pins, therefore the routing of PCB
traces between a CPU and RAM slots must be done with great precision. At the
speeds of modern parallel RAM interfaces like DDR4, what is theoretically a
digital interface in practice must be viewed as practically analog (to the
point that part of a CPU DDR4 controller is called the “PHY”). Moreover, the
maximum distance between a CPU and its RAM slots is extremely tight. The
positioning of RAM slots on a motherboard is largely constrained by these
physics considerations. For these reasons you have never seen anything like the

<p><strong>Background.</strong> In recent years, the computing and embedded systems industry
has adopted a habit of implementing “secure boot” functionality. More often
than not, this is implemented by allowing a hash of a cryptographic public key
to be fused into eFuses in a main CPU or SoC. When such a design is adopted,
the private keys are invariably held by a device vendor and not by the device
owner<sup><a href="https://www.devever.net/~hl/index.feed.atom#fn1" id="fn1b">1</a></sup>, which means that only the
device vendor can provide updated firmware for the device. This is problematic
for a number of reasons:</p>

<p>Software, particularly server software or the software running on network
equipment, frequently requires configuration, often provided in the form of a
configuration file. No particular standard for a configuration language has
ever come to dominate, so the number of configuration file formats is almost as
large as the number of pieces of software needing configuration.</p>

<p>Nowadays, there is increasing interest in adding tagged memory functionality to
CPU architectures. Such architectures associate one or more tag bits with each
quantum of a system's memory. There are many motivations for this ability to
associate “metadata” with individual memory words, but one of the most clear is
the potential security benefits and the ability to track the providence of
certain kinds of data in memory, such as pointers. This can be used to create
capability-based architectures such as CHERI.</p>

of Perl and PHP-based web forums abounded, forming the centres of little

<p>How much do you know about how the PSTN (that is, the public telephone network)
works? At some point long long ago, it was signalled using in-band frequencies,
which facilitated the infamous phreaking using so-called “blue boxes”. This led
to a switch to out of band signalling, ultimately culminating in something
known as Signalling System 7 (SS7). SS7 traditionally was carried over things
like a T1/E1 or similar. The standards for SS7 are defined by the ITU-T and
have basically no “cultural” relation to the Internet or IP. Ultimately, it
defines a circuit switched communications network based around separated
signalling and time-division-multiplexed (TDM) voice channels.</p>

website using client-side JavaScript, there was a feature of HTML which seems
almost unused today, and which would be unlikely to be implemented in web
browsers if proposed today; namely, image maps.</p>

<ul><li><a href="https://www.more-magic.net/posts/internals-data-representation.html">Chicken Scheme's internal data representation</a></li></ul><p>Fascinating writeup on the internal representation of values in Chicken Scheme.
The design of value representations in a Scheme implementation needs to balance
performance and memory usage while supporting a finite number of value types,
so seeing the strategies chosen by a real-world implementation is  always
interesting. The further reading section provides links to information on the
internal representation used by several other languages.</p>

<p>“Numbering hegemonies” is a term I've come up with to
describe a certain kind of artificial monopoly which is
common in the IT industry, though by no means necessarily
constrained to it.</p>

<p>For some time, I've come to the conclusion that would not actually be possible
for us to establish a colony on another planet — Mars, for example — which is
independent of Earth with our existing systems of technology.</p>

<p>The <code>&lt;keygen/&gt;</code> element is probably one of the weirdest elements ever added to HTML:</p>

<p>This is a bit of a follow up to <a href="https://www.devever.net/~hl/web-keygen">Memoirs from the old web: The KEYGEN
element</a>, which touched on deployment issues around client
certificates. While client certificates aren't popular for web browser use
today due to their terrible UI, at least outside of organisations' internal
networks, they perhaps enjoy a bit more popularity for non-web-browser usage,
such as for securing traffic to cloud APIs.</p>

<p>Today, Internet Explorer has been consigned to the dustbin of history, yet its
quirks and peculiar features remain an interesting area of discussion from a
historical perspective. There was one particular feature of IE which not only
now seems comically naive, but also completely impractical: namely, IE tried to
pioneer a system of content rating.</p>

<p>One of the most ubiquitous patterns found in the design of binary file formats
