In the midst of a major reshuffling within the DCU, a few movies are just kind of floating in in-betweenland. Movies like The Flash and Shazam 2 Fury of the Gods basically flopped, at least partially due to the fact that audiences aren’t really sure if they’re supposed to care or not. Blue Beetle is the latest movie in that trend, that’s maybe starting off the James Gunn DC reign? Maybe? But also just kind of doing it’s own thing?

Blue Beetle definitely raises some questions. Like why does this movie look so familiar? Why is this the 10,000th evil business person that wants to use a supersuit to sell as weapons? Why does that guy on the Big Belly Burger box look so much like Screenwriter Guy?

To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to Blue Beetle!
