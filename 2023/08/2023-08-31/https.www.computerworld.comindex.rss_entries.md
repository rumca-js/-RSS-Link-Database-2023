<p>As time goes by, people are becoming less trusting of artificial intelligence (AI), according to the results of a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/08/28/growing-public-concern-about-the-role-of-artificial-intelligence-in-daily-life/" rel="nofollow">recent Pew Research study</a>. The study, which involved 11,000 respondents, found that attitudes had changed sharply in just the past two years.</p><p>In 2021, 37% of respondents said they were more concerned than excited about AI. That number stayed pretty much the same last year (38%), but has now jumped to 52%.

<p>Microsoft today said that as of Oct. 1, it will start unbundling Teams from Microsoft 365 and Office 365 in Europe after the European Commission opened an antitrust investigation into the company.</p><p>The original<a href="https://slack.com/intl/de-de/blog/news/slack-files-eu-competition-complaint-against-microsoft" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> competition complaint</a> was filed by team chat software rival Slack in July 2020, alleging that Microsoft was engaging in the “illegal and anti-competitive practice of abusing its market dominance to extinguish competition in breach of European Union competition law” by tying its Teams product to the Office productivity suite, “force installing it for millions, blocking its removal, and hiding the true cost to enterprise customers.”</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3705931/microsoft-to-unbundle-teams-from-its-office-suites-in-europe.html#jump">To read this

<p>Apple deployments are <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3705669/idc-sees-big-enterprise-shift-to-macs-over-next-12-months.html">accelerating across the global enterprise</a>, so it’s surprising that many organizations don't properly recognize that change. Even when companies put Macs, iPhones, and iPads in the hands of their employees, they are failing to manage these deployments. It’s quite shocking.</p><p>That’s the biggest take-away from the latest <a href="https://www.jamf.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Jamf research</a>, which warns that almost half of enterprises across Europe still don’t have a formal Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) policy in place. That’s bad, as it means companies have no control over how employees connect and use corporate resources, creating a nice, soft attack surface for criminals and competitors alike.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3705988/with-byod-come
