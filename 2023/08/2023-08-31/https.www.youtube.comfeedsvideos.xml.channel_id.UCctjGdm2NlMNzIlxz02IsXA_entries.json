I'm what you would call an epic gamist and I've been cautiously optimistic for this lil game for a while. Lets jump in and see what all the hullabaloooh is all about. I hope I can get married in this game so I can live out my fantasy of going through a messy divorce and running away to the deep reaches of space to flee the cold grasp of my bitch ex wife (possibly named Bethany or something) I hope this game can do that for me hahhahahahahahahaha\n\nSocial Media!\nTWITTER \u25ba https://twitter.com/ChrisRGun\nINSTAGRAM \u25ba https://www.instagram.com/chris_ray_gun/\nTWITCH \u25ba https://www.twitch.tv/chrisraygun\nTIKTOK \u25ba https://www.tiktok.com/@chrisraygun\nSUBREDDIT \u25ba https://www.reddit.com/r/ChrisRayGun/\n\nSupport Me Over Here!\nMERCH \u25ba https://teespring.com/stores/chris-ray-gun\nPATREON \u25ba https://www.patreon.com/ChrisRay\n\nPodcasts!\nSACRED SYMBOLS : A PLAYSTATION PODCAST \u25ba https://apple.co/2Rqmklc\nSNARK TANK \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/c/TheSnarkTank", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcPjrEuh-us", "date_published": "2023-08-31T22:34:55+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Chris Ray Gun", "album": "Chris Ray Gun", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/fcPjrEuh-us/hqdefault.jpg"}]
