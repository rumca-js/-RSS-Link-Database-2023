Hello and Welcome to TUESDAY NEWSDAY! Your number one resource for the entire weeks worth of VR news! 

I AM BACK! I am sorry I have been gone for so long- but it was a much needed break. Today we get into basically EVERYTHING you need to know about the Quest 3- whether you should upgrade your Quest 2 ( or other headset). We also talk about V57 for quest 2, Pro and 3- some awesome AR contact lens research and I open up a bit about what's been going on in my life.

I HOPE YOU ENJOY! MUCH LOVE!
