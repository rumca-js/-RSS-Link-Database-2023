Wonder. \n\nRather than the traditional Mushroom Kingdom, Super Mario Bros. Wonder instead takes place in the Flower Kingdom - home of the Wonder Flower. Of course, while Mario, Peach, and friends are visiting the kingdom - Bowser interrupts wrecking havoc.\n\nOnce your adventure starts, Mario Wonder will let you take care of plenty of characters from the Mushroom Kingdom, including Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, two Toads, Toadette, four Yoshi's, and Nabbit. Mario Wonder seems to be a true step forward for the 2D Mario franchise, and the most major step since Super Mario World.\n\nFor more info on the Flower Kingdom, new enemies like Bloomps and Skedaddles, and what Wonder Flowers will mean for your journey - check out our full preview right here, written by Steve Watts.\n\n#gaming #supermariowonder  #gamespot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wMow-8uBLs", "date_published": "2023-08-31T00:00:00+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GameSpot", "album": "GameSpot", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3wMow-8uBLs/maxresdefault.jpg"}]
