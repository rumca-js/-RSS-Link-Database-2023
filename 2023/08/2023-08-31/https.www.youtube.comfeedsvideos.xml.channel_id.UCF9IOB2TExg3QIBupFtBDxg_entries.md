Natural immunity 27 times better

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Naturally Acquired Immunity versus Vaccine-induced Immunity, Reinfections versus Breakthrough Infections: A Retrospective Cohort Study

https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/75/1/e545/6563799

Background

Waning of protection, 

conferred by 2 doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine,

begins shortly after injection,

becomes substantial within 4 months. 

We examined long-term protection of naturally acquired immunity,

compared to vaccine-induced immunity.

Group 1, N = 673,676

Vaccine not Infection Group 

SARS-CoV-2-naive individuals who received a 2-dose regimen of the BioNTech/Pfizer mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine.

Group 2, N = 62,883

Infection not Vaccine Group 

Previously infected individuals who have not been vaccinated

SARS-CoV-2-related outcomes

June 1st to August 14th 2021

(Delta variant times)

Infection, 13 times more infections in vaccinated group

Symptomatic disease, 27 times more diseas
