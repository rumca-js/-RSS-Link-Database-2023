<p>The Eternal Anglo comes in many shapes and sizes! And America is made not of a homogeneous group of Britons, but at least four systematically different ethnic groups varying by social values, dialect, dress, gender relationships, religion, worldview. These ethnic groups create the regionalisms of today's America and also have affected superstrate populations after them.</p><p>This episode surveys David Hackett Fischer's monumental work <em>Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America</em>. We talk not only about these four ethnic groups, which will sound very familiar, but also on a history of the United States, particularly its most significant political battles, interpreted through this ethnic lens.</p><h1>Timecodes</h1><pre>00:00	The End of End of History
