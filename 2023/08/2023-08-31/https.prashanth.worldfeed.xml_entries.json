There are blogs emphasizing readability when writing code. There are plenty of essays, even books about how to write code that is easy to extend and add functionality. While I think emphasizing readability and adding functionality are important qualities of writing scalable code, I think there\u2019s not as much stuff out there about how to write code that\u2019s easy to debug. I\u2019m hoping to write more of these, but here\u2019s one lesson I\u2019ve learned on making code easier to untangle and debug.", "link": "https://prashanth.world/prashanth.world/code-for-debugging/", "date_published": "2023-08-31T10:49:07.210002+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Prashanth Sadasivan", "album": "Prashanth Sadasivan", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://prashanth.world/feed.xml", "title": "Elixir - A fascinating combination of concepts", "description": "Programming Languages are created in order to solve problems.
