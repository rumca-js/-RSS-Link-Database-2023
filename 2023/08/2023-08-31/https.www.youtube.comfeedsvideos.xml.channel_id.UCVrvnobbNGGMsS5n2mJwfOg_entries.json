I was excited to get on the road again and persuaded my dad to join as well. Ive had many adventures with Regenerate like when we cycled all the way down to Africa from London in 2018 and kayaking the length of the Thames in 2019 and although this year I couldn\u2019t join for their whole trip from Italy it was great to tag along for the last leg and give my bike a proper test run, I love what Regenerate have been doing for the last few decades and are proud to support the fundraising efforts for their community work in Southwest London.\n\ud83d\udcf7: @insta360 \n\ud83d\udeb2: @evans_cycles \n#Insta360 #Insta360X3", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hniHDd2q3is", "date_published": "2023-08-31T00:00:00+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "FunForLouis", "album": "FunForLouis", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hniHDd2q3is/sd2.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEoCIAFEOAD8quKqQMcGADwAQH4AbYIgAKAD4oCDAgAEAEYUiBZKGUwDw==&rs=AOn4CLCm6xThtDVCKXPSqL4hUwjyPnmWAA"}]
