<p>Patience. <em>Starfield </em>is a huge game set in a universe of newly inhabited planets, and it combines interstellar travel with furious gunplay, alien exploration, spaceship management, character customization and interpersonal strife, and it takes a moment for all of these layers to merge into a coherent experience. But, give <em>Starfield </em>time, approach its systems with grace, and you’ll be rewarded with a big, generic sci-fi RPG.</p><p><em>Starfield </em>has moments of beauty, but it features just as many instances of drudgery and disconnection in its main quest line. Playing on pre-release code on Xbox Series S, these issues are only exacerbated by chugging framerates, low-resolution set pieces and roughly one hard crash every five hours. <em>Starfield </em>is big and largely bland, and while it gets some open-world gameplay aspects right, it doesn’t offer anything new for the sci-fi or RPG genres.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Starfield" s

<p>Shure may not have changed much of the design of its Aonic 50 headphones for the second-generation version, but it did a lot of work on the inside to massively upgrade all-around performance. The company <a href="https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/headphones/aonic50?variant=SBH50G2-BK">announced the new model today</a>, a set of $349 premium noise-canceling wireless headphones that now offer spatial audio, improved active noise cancellation (ANC) and twice the battery life of the previous version.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of sound quality, Shure says the new Aonic 50 has its spatial audio tech onboard that leverages an &quot;acoustical modeling and critical listening&quot; algorithm to offer immersion without compromising the original audio. There are three modes here — Music, Cinema and Podcast — which the company explains are tailored to each use case. Music mode offers the experience of listening with &quot;high-end speakers&quot; while Cinema mode adds more low-end tone to give

Part of this is because the show is mature enough to laugh at itself, and part of it is because it’s now letting its characters grow.

What are refresh rates? What’s the difference between NVIDIA G-Sync and AMD FreeSync? Those are just some of the questions this guide aims to answer, and, in the process, help you find the best gaming monitor for your budget.</p><h2>LCD vs OLED</h2><p>When shopping for a new gaming monitor, you first need to decide if you want to go with a screen that has an LCD or OLED panel. For most people, that choice will come down to price; OLED gaming monitors are significantly more expensive than their LCD counterparts. But even if money isn’t a concern, the choice might not be as straightforward as you think.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>LCD monitors come in three different varieties: twisted nematic

<p>HP's Pavilion Plus lineup offers some of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hp-oled-pavilion-laptop-120311002.html">best</a> mid-range laptop models out there, thanks to features like 16:10 displays with slim bezels, good keyboards/touchpads and solid specs. Now, the company has released its first 16-inch model, the HP Pavilion Plus 16, offering a 16.5-inch 120Hz 2.5K display, along with the latest Intel Core i7 processors — and starting at $1,000. HP also refreshed the Pavilion Plus 14 with the latest AMD and Intel processors and, as before, an OLED display option.</p><p>The Pavilion Plus 16 is targeted to serious business and education users, but is available with up to a 13th-gen Intel Core i7-13700H (14 cores, 20 threads) and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 GPU. That, along with the 2,560 x 1,600, 120Hz VRR display, means the high end model is good for content creation and gaming as well — though it will obviously cost a lot more than the $1,000 base model.</p><span id="end-lega

<p>Clearblue has launched a new product that can determine what stage of menopause a person is in. The <a href="https://www.clearblue.com/menopause/stage-indicator">"Menopause Stage Indicator"</a> is a urine testing device and it's the company's first for this underserved market in women's health.</p><p>The Menopause Stage Indicator looks like a standard pregnancy test stick but instead of measuring urine for pregnancy hormones, it will look for follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, which are measured to confirm menopause. To get accurate test results, you’ll have to conduct five urine tests over ten days, and Clearblue recommends they be taken every other day. Using FSH levels, menstrual cycle history, and a person’s age, the company will be able to determine and confirm the menopause stage. The app will calculate if a person is in premenopause, early perimenopause, late perimenopause, or postmenopause.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In its press release, <a href="
