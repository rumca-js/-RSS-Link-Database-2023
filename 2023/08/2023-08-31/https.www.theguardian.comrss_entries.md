<p>There are crunch showdowns at the Emirates and at Bramall Lane while Manchester City already look imperious</p><p>Winning the Conference League did not do much to lift the pressure on David Moyes after an underwhelming domestic season, but the clouds look to be lifting. New signings have joined to bolster the ranks and only two points have been dropped in three matches, to put the Hammers second behind Manchester City. Things could <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/26/brighton-west-ham-premier-league-match-report">hardly be going better</a>. One problem Moyes will soon face is European football, an activity that hindered West Ham’s league form last season. To limit its impact, picking up points in winnable matches – such as Friday’s trip to Kenilworth Road – will be crucial. At this stage last season, West Ham had failed to muster a point and they collected only four from their opening seven matches. They have the foundations to build on this time around and L

She is a 26-year-old biochemist, brought up in Ireland since the age of three by her Nigerian parents, both practising Catholics, a former Love Island contestant and – crucially, here – has never had an orgasm.

These days, the Turkish champions are probably awkward rather than intimidating, and have signed the very familiar faces of Wilfried Zaha, Mauro Icardi, Angeliño and Hakim Ziyech.

The gym is only about 50 metres from my house so I can’t use distance as an excuse not to turn up. It’s a lovely space, with pastel walls and big industrial windows. The bathroom has free emergency supplies of tampons, deodorant, hair ties and sometimes even chocolate, and there is always a pot of spiced cinnamon tea you can drink before you start your class.</p><p>Here, I’ve learned how to bench-press, dead-lift and squat.

But the new live-action version of One Piece, a decades-running Japanese comics series that has been adapted into a beloved anime series and many animated features, could actually play well for those two audience segments. Hardcore fans of previous incarnations may simply be fascinated to see such eccentric material finally and improbably translated into flesh and blood, while Netflix surfers intrigued by a strange, pirate-centric, superpower-augmented adventure-fantasy series may delight in the sheer novelty factor.

This game is a clear reflection of its classic Japanese RPG influences, artfully pixellated like some late, lost classic of the Super Nintendo era. It opens with a story told in dense, fabulist prose by a mysterious figure, then introduces us to a pair of elementally opposed teenage heroes, Zale and Valere, supported by their lesser-destinied but charismatic friend, Garl.</p><p>Then the game picks up its stride. The cast widens, and things deepen and change. There is a lot more beneath the surface here than may first appear.</p><p>Sea of Stars is out now; £29.50</p> <a href="https

They clearly haven’t split up – their social media is filled with recent photos of the trio in various combinations – but a follow-up to I See You looks a long way off. “Blink twice if you’re making new music,” posted one desperate fan beneath an Instagram clip of Oliver Sim and Romy Madley Croft cuddling on a Paris balcony.</p><p>Instead they have pursued solo careers – albeit that various members of the band have appeared on each other’s proje

That summer, she travelled to Bonn in Germany, where she began looking for a summer job. “I went there because my mother was based in the city at the time,” she says. “The European Swimming Championships were on, so I rang up looking for a volunteer position.” She landed a coveted spot in the driving team, taking swimmers to various destinations across the city. “Someone had dropped out, and I got lucky.

<p>Deregulation and financialisation cause environmental, economic and social harms – but the party aims to give finance even more power</p><p>The City is a “jewel in the crown” of the UK economy for the Conservative government, which aims to keep the sector growing by seriously weakening regulatory standards. This approach will come as no shock given the City’s current form has its roots in Margaret Thatcher’s big bang, but what is surprising is that the Labour party too is pushing for further deregulation.</p><p>In nearly 30 years campaigning on finance, I cannot recall both major political parties promoting the interests of finance so aggressively. Yes, the UK needs a successful financial sector, but deregulation and financialisation – a process whereby financial markets and institutions gain greater influence over policy and economic outcomes – is dangerous and costly for the rest of us.</p><p>Mick McAteer is co-director of the Financial Inclusion Centre and a former board member

<p>Searching for answers after her mother’s suicide, Walter rediscovers a radical family history</p><p>Natasha Walter didn’t listen when her mother, Ruth, talked of killing herself. She’d been saying it for years and though she complained of suffering from dementia there had been no formal diagnosis and her memory lapses weren’t unusual for a 75-year-old. Besides, would someone so timid and anxious have the nerve? Ruth loved her two daughters and her grandchildren, and she thought of her life as happy: why bring it to a premature end?</p><p>But there had been warning signs: the pieces of jewellery she gave away; the lunch to which she invited all the family despite the lack of an occasion to celebrate; her refusal to make plans for the future. Worried, Natasha took her to lunch one day, at the end of which Ruth told her where to find the key to her locked cabinet if ever she needed it. Natasha didn’t listen to that either. Four days later Ruth took her own life, using a substance she

But breaking that taboo can transform life – especially for women and people of colour</p><p>When Martina, a 35-year-old IT analyst, told colleagues what she earned, they confirmed her worst suspicions. It wasn’t what they said, but what they didn’t say. Martina had seen similar roles to hers being advertised locally, all with a higher salary than her roughly £30,000 package. But when she brought it up with her co-workers, most of whom were men, “they all got uncomfortable”, she says. “None of them told me their salary, just that they were happy enough.” When a role was advertised in her organisation that sounded similar to hers, but with a higher salary, she took it up with management. “It didn’t go well,” she says.</p><p>Martina was told there was no budget for a pay increase. She went to HR to ask why new recruits were being paid more and was told all salaries had been benchmarked regionally.

<p>The classic movie’s unforgettable performances and CGI effects remain glorious 30 years after its original release</p><p>This has long since become a tired franchise, but’s a treat now to revisit Steven Spielberg’s original film for its 30th anniversary. It is a spectacular and thrilling movie about Jurassic Park, the hubristic tourist attraction offering real-life dinosaurs cloned from dinosaur blood that has been extracted from insects encased in ancient amber. But what if something goes wrong and the dinosaurs turn out to be bigger, stronger and angrier in captivity than we thought?</p><p>The film is based on a bestseller by Michael Crichton, and – as with Spielberg’s version of JG Ballard’s Empire of the Sun – the darker, dystopian notes of the original have been strategically de-emphasised to focus more brightly on the adventure and conventional jeopardy involved, along with childlike awe and wonder. Jurassic Park also has one of the boldest and catchiest John Williams scores

<p>Black Atlantic at Cambridge’s Fitzwilliam museum explores how Britain’s role in slavery can be seen through its fine art. Rather than giving easy answers, reflection is its aim</p><p>“I am the sugar at the bottom of the English cup of tea,” wrote the cultural critic Stuart Hall, a Jamaican-born descendant of enslaved Africans. But today he’d have trouble convincing those who still couch Britain’s imperial past in terms of its civilising mission that a refreshing cuppa is an act of complicity in the Atlantic slave trade.</p><p>Research increasingly reveals, however, the extent to which Britain’s wealth was predicated on the centuries-old rapacious plunder of millions of African people. It was not confined to bank accounts and bequests. There are charged traces of slavery’s legacy throughout the land, in fine art and botanical gardens, and in stately homes and museums, such as Cambridge’s Fitzwilliam.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/aug/31/black-atlantic-e

<p>Can’t face another minute thinking about war, inflation or the climate catastrophe? Give your brain a break in a strange, surprising or entrancing corner of the internet. We’ve got riddles, we’ve got webcams, we’ve got an owl in a box …</p><p>I must be about 1,000 years old in internet years (which are even shorter than dog years). I remember doing a summer job as a student in 1995, being instructed to research something on the computer and sitting in front of AltaVista (a primitive search engine, young folk), with absolutely no idea what to do. I was supposed to press some buttons? Information would come out? What?</p><p>As a digital migrant rather than a native, I also remember how amazing it felt to stumble my way around the internet in the 90s and early 00s, uncovering its unexpected nooks and crannies with astonishment and delight; it was an exciting and genuinely joyful time. Now I watch other people shout at each other, assailed by news of catastrophes and bombarded with ad

<p>Nobody normally gives a second thought to dust, but it is inescapable. And if we pay close attention, we can see the biggest things – time, death and life itself – within these tiny floating particles</p><p>For two centuries, London’s buildings were black. Blanketed in sulphurous soot from coal fires – the famous London “pea souper” fogs – a thin layer of carbon coated every surface in the city. London was so dirty that there was no memory that it might ever have been any other way. During the restoration of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/18/winston-churchill-shocked-by-downing-street-restoration-plan" title="">10 Downing Street in 1954</a>, it was discovered that the familiar dark facade was not actually black at all, but originally yellow brick. The shock was considered too much for the country to take and the newly clean building was painted black to maintain its previous, familiar appearance.</p><p>But then, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a

<p>The nurse is the most prolific child serial killer in modern British history. Could the NHS have prevented her committing so many crimes?</p><p>The trial of Lucy Letby was chilling but, alongside the horror at her crimes and the heartbreak of hearing of what the victim’s parents had been through, was astonishment. Not just that someone who was supposed to care for helpless babies on a neonatal unit could take so many lives, but that she had not been stopped sooner.</p><p>North of England correspondent <strong>Josh Halliday</strong> has spent most of the last year covering the trial and talking to those involved in it. He spoke to whistleblowing medics who were not just ignored, but treated as troublemakers for trying to ensure she was investigated. And he heard how the advice of two reviews – that forensic investigations should be launched – were not followed. He also tells <strong>Nosheen Iqbal</strong> about the measures the government is taking to ensure that such a terrible ca
