Starfield is truly special. There’s never any shortage of games that promise staggeringly vast and complex experiences, but Starfield is a rare example of a game that somehow actually delivers an experience with even more staggering depth and scale than what it promises. 

It delivers in nearly every way possible, from its painstaking world-building and how effectively it builds its interstellar setting with rich, captivating lore to the main engaging stories you’ll discover throughout the galaxy, both big and small, from the endless amounts of freedom it offers in letting you be who you want to be and play how you want to play, to how ridiculously fun and rewarding its ship building and spaceflight gameplay loop feels. 

For those who’ve been wondering if, after the last few years, Bethesda Game Studios still has it in itself to retain its crown as the king of massive RPGs, its latest space-faring RPG sends those questions flying out the airlock.

In addition to a complex web of gameplay mechanics and systems, Starfield also impresses with its visuals that have been built using Creation Engine 2. 

Despite sticking to traditional rendering techniques, Starfield is able to achieve a striking level of detail right from the physically based materials to the complex terrain geometry and much more. We have tested the game on both the Xbox Series X and a high-end PC, and with this feature - we will be diving deep into the technical aspects of the game and see how the two versions stack up against one another in terms of visuals and performance.
