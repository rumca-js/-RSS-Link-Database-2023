On the Nanjing subway, a woman was given a ticket for drinking water on the subway. When a journalist inquired about it, Subway authorities responded by saying that eating and drinking were prohibited on trains. Water is a form of drink. Once spotted, one must be fined. If passengers are thirsty, they can get off the train drink on the platform, and come back up when done. 
The crazy operation of imposing fines will undoubtedly and significantly add to the burden of running a business. Consumers suffer in the end. They have to shell out more money for spending. Fines might lead business operators to cut back on quality, or, worse, close the businesses, resulting in less supply of products and a continual rise in the unemployment rate.
