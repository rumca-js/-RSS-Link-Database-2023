It is a flexible abstraction that works as the basis for other abstractions, such as Promises, Iterables, Observables, and others. I have been teaching these concepts in conferences and workshops, and over time I have found an elegant summary of these abstractions, layed out in a pyramid. In this blog post I\u2019ll provide a tour through these layers in the pyramid.

Functions are unavoidable abstractions in JavaScript, they are often required for async I/O via callbacks.

Centralization and decentralization were central themes in cyberspace this year, while regulation and freedom also defined the rhetoric of many actors. We understood how closely cyberspace and meatspace affect each other, demonstrated by a couple of key events in 2018. FB and GOOG peaked (Source: Reuters) When the Cambridge Analytica data scandal was published on March 17th, FB stock took a big hit. In April, Zuckerberg appeared before U.S. Congress to testify, leaving answers that many felt were unsatisfactory. A few months later, as their Q2 earnings report demonstrated little to no growth, many investors immediately sold their stock, leading to 20% drop in price ($120 billion in value). Many seemed to realize that FB is not doing well, neither as a business, nor as a platform for humane discourse.

I learned a lot about the technical details of actually doing this in production (in Manyverse) and have some lessons to share. Summary Since Manyverse version 0.2110.5, all Rust libraries have been removed. This was a sad decision that I had to take, for various technical reasons that I\u2019ll explain below. ssb-neon, renamed to ssb-rsjs (to decouple ourselves from the Neon library in specific), was also supposed to be a community effort. I thought people would spontaneously contribute a Rust variant of simple libraries like ssb-ref, ssb-serve-blobs, etc, because I trusted in the spontaneous and modular contribution model that powered the pull-stream community and the callbag community. To my surprise, apart from the two initial ones I built, no one else made an ssb-rsjs library. @Daan (if I remember correctly) tried to start one, and @glyph built one for ", "link": "https://staltz.com/rust-for-mobile-not-yet.html", "date_published": "2023-08-31T10:48:35.217953+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Andr\u00e9 Staltz", "album": "Andr\u00e9 Staltz", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://staltz.com/feed.xml", "title": "Some people want to run their own servers", "description": "This post is a reply to Moxie\u2019s recent article \u201cMy first impressions on web3\u201d. Although I am writing a criticism, I am grateful for Moxie\u2019s post because it exposes several truths that underlie web3, which most people are not willing to see. There is a surprising amount of centralization actively brewing in the \u201cdecentralized\u201d space and most of its advocates don\u2019t seem concerned. I think money (especially loads of money) blinds people to the uncomfortable truths that Moxie made explicit. At the same time, Moxie referred to other uncomfortable truths but somehow didn\u2019t address them directly. This is why I felt compelled to write. I liked the honesty of his post but I want an even more honest discussion. Some claims he wrote are factually wrong and sound like mere ideology.

On the surface, it seems true. To name a few archetypal examples: Wikipedia, open source projects such as Linux, hacktivism, and crowdsourced science experiments such as Rosetta@home. However, those successes did not happen as coordination, planning, and execution at a global scale. There is little collaboration taking place. I used to believe there was mass collaboration on the internet. But I\u2019ve realized that collaboration is extremely hard. It does not scale, especially not at internet scale. The examples we look up to are either not collaborative on the microscopic level, or are rare exceptions to the rule.

I would have told younger me about this, if I could. When you\u2019re working on changing a system (and codebases are systems), it is extremely tempting to change more aspects than you\u2019re originally planned to. Say you wanted to just fix a bug. You found the culprit, but you also saw a badly named variable, a function that could be split into two, some code style changes to make, some libraries to be updated, and something else that seemed like a bug. So you fixed all of those things, and you committed it. This may seem efficient, because you are doing more work in one go, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s actually the opposite. It is more efficient to fix only one thing per git commit. Choose one aspect, or one \u201cparameter\u201d, and change only that.

We are currently witnessing the most fragmented environment for social networks since the dawn of Twitter and Facebook. The two reasons are: Twitter is in decay, and decentralized alternatives are alive and thriving. This is good and bad. Good because, hey, we\u2019re finally decentralizing this space! Bad because it\u2019s unclear (at least that\u2019s how I\u2019ve been feeling) where to publish your content. I used to be very active on Twitter, but Twitter is ruined for me now.
