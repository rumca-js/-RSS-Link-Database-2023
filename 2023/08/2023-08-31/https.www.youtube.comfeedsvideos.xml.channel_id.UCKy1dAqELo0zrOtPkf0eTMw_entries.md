It’s a vast universe out there in Bethesda’s Starfield, filled to the brim with planets to survey, space pirates to parlay, and tons of guns and weapons with which to play. It’s all a bit overwhelming, but fortunately, we’ve got some recommendations for the 10 Things to do First in Starfield, from factions to join, to places to hit up first, and a few thoughts on what you should and shouldn’t stress about when it comes to creating your character for the first time. 
Beyond that, you’ll find our reasoning for why you should probably stick to the main quest for at least the first handful of hours of the game, where to sell off the massive amounts of loot you pick up, and much much more.

## Starfield can be frustrating, but it also has a lot to offer. We give it a 7/10. #starfield #review

In comparison to Netflix’s Cowboy Bebop series, which saw little to no involvement with its creator, Eiichiro Oda was heavily involved in the production of Netflix’s One Piece series. In fact, Oda-san wrote this note where he had the Netflix production team reshoot certain scenes he felt just didn’t fit into the world he created. From the visuals to the scripted lines, Oda-san was heavily involved in the overall production for #OnePiece on #Netflix. And he also mentioned in the note that if there’s any gripes people have with the live-action series, he’ll be there to receive it with the entire crew. The animation in episode 1071 when Luffy kicked it into 5th Gear was a certified instant classic, trending for days across the Internet, with everyone wanting to know more about #gear5.

Starfield reviewed on PC and Xbox Series X by Dan Stapleton.
It’s never a great sign when someone recommends a game on the grounds that it gets good after more than a dozen hours, but that’s very much the kind of game Starfield is, and I do recommend it. There are a lot of forces working against it, and the combination of disjointed space travel, nonexistent maps, aggravating inventory management, and a slow rollout of essential abilities very nearly did it in. It was the joys piloting a custom spaceship into and out of all sorts of morally ambiguous situations in a rich sci-fi universe that eventually pulled it out of a nosedive. I’m glad that I powered through the early hours, because its interstellar mystery story pays off and, once the ball got rolling, combat on foot and in space gradually became good enough that its momentum carried me into New Game+ after I’d finished the main story after around 60 hours. Like Skryim and Fallout 4 before it, there’s still an immense amount of
