<p dir="ltr">AMC Networks has successfully negotiated interim agreements with SAG-AFTRA to resume production on The Walking Dead spin-offs Daryl Dixon and The Ones Who Live--as well as the gothic horror series Interview with the Vampire. The agreements signify a significant development for the network and were confirmed in an exclusive report by <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/08/the-walking-dead-spinoffs-interview-with-the-vampire-to-resume-production-sag-aftra-deal-1235533050/">Deadline</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">AMC declined to elaborate further on the details of these agreements, which are specific to the individual circumstances of each show.

<p dir="ltr">If you're wondering how to respec in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starfield/">Starfield</a>, there's a reason you can't locate the option in-game: It doesn't exist. Instead, there are dozens of skills to unlock, and each one of them can be further enhanced three times over, giving players a massive tiered system of skills to acquire. It would stand to reason that you may wish you could undo a build and respec, or reset your skills, and though you can't, the game makes up for it with a different feature. Here's what you need to know about how to respec in Starfield, as well as the game's level cap details.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Starfield respec and level cap</h2><p dir="ltr">Sure, it would be nice to respec your character when you've already poured dozens of skill points into them, but you can't do it here.

<p>Wealth, fame, power. In the two and a half decades since Eiichiro Oda first created the legendary manga-turned-anime series One Piece, it has obtained this and everything else the world has to offer. Since 1997, the swashbuckling Shonen Jump serial has maintained an extraordinary level of adoration and popularity, culminating in record-breaking sales and one of the longest-running anime series around. Suffice to say that, much like series' protagonist Monkey D. Luffy himself, One Piece has built up something of a reputation for itself: a legacy filled with wonder, adventure, exuberance, and just a pinch of notoriety, thanks to its ever-expanding episode count. Now, the Straw Hat Pirates have set course for a new adventure, through tumultuous waters and guided by the whims of streaming service executives; One Piece now has a live-action Netflix series. And, much like the crew's other ventures, it's a seriously fun time.</p><p dir="ltr">Following the less-than-enthusiastic reception

<p dir="ltr">Handheld gaming PCs have gradually inched toward the mainstream over the past few years. Yes, portable PCs are still relatively niche, but there are signs of more widespread interest and adoption in the near future. The success of Valve's Linux-powered Steam Deck, of course, is the prime example of this. On the Windows front, Asus, a major player in the PC hardware market, recently dipped its toes into the portable PC scene with the ROG Ally. Influential manufacturer support is key in popularizing new tech, but perhaps even more important is practicality.</p><p dir="ltr">High-end portable PCs routinely retail for $1,000 or more, yet they are comparatively weak (in many cases) to desktop PCs.

Even the clunkily self-aware name clearly designates it as a retro throwback meant to evoke the classics, not reinvent them. So while it's been 10 years since we've gotten a new 2D Mario game, it's actually been much longer since we've seen Nintendo approach a 2D Mario with the thoughtful, evolutionary design philosophy that defined his earliest sequels. However, based on a brief play session, Super Mario Bros. Wonder may very well be the next true successor in a continuum of 2D Mario design.</p><p dir="ltr">The titular wonder of Mario Wonder comes from its fantastical stage effects: unique, tailored mechanics that are custom-made for each stage. When you find a Wonder Flower, the entire stage changes to conform to some wild new reality. Most if not all of the Wonder Flowers are entirely missable, which means that each stage is designed to function on two levels--as a regular, well-crafted Mario platf

<p>The Borderlands franchise holds a peculiar place within the history of the gaming industry, kickstarting a genre that has gone on to become a different kind of beast. After all, though the concept of combining both RPG and first-person shooter mechanics was first seen in 2007's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hellgate-london/">Hellgate: London</a>, the loot-shooter genre owes its popularity to 2009's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands/">Borderlands</a>. And yet, today, many of the most popular loot-shooters are also live-service games (like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/warframe/">Warframe</a>).
