## Why do I so rarely talk about politics on my channel?

<p>It's not a huge secret that I'm somewhere in the high echelons of the
red-pill, however you define it. I'll openly talk about pretty any
topic that people organically bring up in streams, or that I'm asked
about, but I've never really made any kind of political content on my
channel, aside from jokes and memes. That might be surprising because
especially three years ago before the mass-bans and algoritm tampering,
right wing political channels were a dime-a-dozen and an easily way to
get views. <strong>There are two main reasons</strong> I never took part. Arguably
&quot;fear of being ZUCCed from YouTube&quot; could be a possible third, but I
have a kind intransigence that makes me relish me being banned. I'm
also pretty tired of YouTube, and am increasingly questioning if using
it is even a reasonable compromise...</p>
<p>So why do I not do political videos? Why do I not have a set list of
deep facts that will blow you away and red-pill you? The two reasons:</p>

<h2 id="the-parable">The Parable</h2>
<p>Suppose an alien race comes to Earth and wants to observe our games.
They are very interested in chess, despite the fact that they have eyes
with properties that make it impossible to make out what actually
happens on a chess board. (The whites and blacks and squares all blur
together.)</p>
<p>They can still learn about chess experimentally, they know they can sit
two players (a so-called &quot;white&quot; and &quot;black&quot; player) down to play
it, and they can tell behaviorally who at the end wins.</p>
<p>After extensive experimentation, they realize this: 50% of the time, the
white player wins and 50% of the time, the black player wins (we'll
ignore draws and any first-move advantage for the example).

## Reviews of All Linux Distros (That Matter)

<p>Firstly, once you reach basic competency in Linux, different
distributions don't matter. A lot of newbies analyze distros based on
what they look like when you install them, often not realizing that
it's a pretty simple affair not just to change superficial things like
your theme and setup, but entire desktop environments. <strong>Basically all
distro reviews online are wastes of time for people who know what
they're doing.</strong> When I came to YouTube, all Linux YouTube was was
people constantly installing distro after distro in a virtual machine
and critiquing minutiae. It was a bleak and boring world. One of my
first and greatest achievements on YouTube was making this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zpgQpdy_fI">How
to choose a Linux distro: Stop
Thinking!</a>, which went
semi-viral and sort of put a damper on distro reviews. Either way, I'll
say what I think about different distro minutiae here.</p>

<p>I get asked a lot about learning languages, so I have a few comments
about it here. Hopefully I can awaken you from some dogmatic slumbers
about language.</p>
<h2 id="vocabulary-is-the-least-important-part-of-learning-a-language">Vocabulary is the least important part of learning a language.</h2>
<p>This is hard for people to understand because I think most monolingual
people think that languages are just different word lists that people
use. As a result, 101 students will manually look up every word in the
dictionary to translate. This actually increases the mental load of
learning a language because people have the idea that to speak it, they
have to think of something in English, then translate the sentence word
by word, then say that. What a pain.</p>
<p>So what is a language if not words? It really is a set of constraints as
to how words can go together: what order they go in when modifying each
other, but also languages are morphology. Verb endings and tenses and
such are li

<p>In America, people are so <strong>notoriously dumb</strong> with credit and money
that credit card companies can <em>literally give out free money by the
hundreds</em> to attract new customers. For brainlets who don't bother to
understand the basics of credit and debt and the fact that you
apparently have to pay back the money you spend, this is like a fly
trap. For non-retarded people it is what it is: <em>free money</em>.</p>

<p>I've said on a couple livestreams that the ideal way for an English
speaker to begin learning or excel in learning other major European
languages (Spanish, French, Italian and German) is to use <strong>Michel
Thomas's audiotapes</strong>. They can be found for free on Pirate Bay and
other sites, but you can also buy them <a href="https://www.michelthomas.com/">on his official
site</a>.</p>
<p>This style of audiotapes is so far above any other, it's hard to even
put it in words. They make really exceptional promises: &quot;learn a
language in 8 hours&quot; and in some sense I'm inclined to agree.</p>
<p>They certainly give a reflexive foundation that makes learning anything

<p>Latin was the first language I learned and has probably been the most
useful. Here I'll talk about some of the things it's gotten me and
some recommendations for how to learn it well.</p>
<h2 id="what-ive-gotten-out-of-learning-latin">What I've gotten out of learning Latin</h2>
<h3 id="you-get-multiple-languages-for-one">You get multiple languages for one.</h3>
<p>Latin, as you probably know is the ancestor of Italian, French, Spanish,
Portuguese, Romanian, etc. Once you know Latin, it is quite literally
downhill learning any of these. In college, I decided to take Spanish
for a degree specialization (I was doing an international business thing
and required a foreign language). Merely based on my knowledge of Latin,
I just tested into fifth-level Spanish and figured it out from there. I
don't even remember learning Spanish, but I can speak it and still do
every once in a while.</p>

<figure class="titleimg"><img src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/qing.gif" title="The Chinese flag back when it was more based before being subverted by communists and democrats." /></figure>

<p>Chinese is the hardest language to learn according to normies who have
never tried to learn it.</p>
<p>In reality, Chinese is really easy. It has literally no complex
morphology: no tense, plurals, gender. It doesn't have irregular verbs
or nouns because it has no verb and noun endings whatsoever. It's
almost difficult to explain how easy Chinese is.</p>
<p>The only different thing is the writing system which is I hesitate to
say anachronistic. The Chinese character system is more structurally
similar to Sumerian cuneiform than to English morphophonemic writing.
That presents a unique hurdle, but one if properly tackled is not too
difficult and also edifying. It's important to realize in any case that
<em>learning a language and learning its writing system are two separate
things</em>.</p>

<figure class="titleimg"><img src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/leshilllion.png" title="le shill lion" /></figure>

<p>I like and use the Brave Browser. It's a <strong>free and open source
browser</strong> with features like:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ad-blocking by default.</li>
<li>Tracker-blocking by default.</li>
<li>Anti-fingerprinting mechanisms to prevent you from being monitored.</li>
<li>Built-in Tor windows.</li>
<li>Run by a based Christian and not furry leftists.</li>
</ol>
<p>As far as I'm concerned, Brave is indisputably the best out-of-the-box general-purpose
browser out there. There are other okay browsers, and I'll mention
things about Brave I don't like, but Brave is especially good because
it comes with all of these sensible features out of the box (you don't
have to go install an ad-blocker), so this makes it very good for
installing it on your grandma's computer. The anti-fingerprinting
abilities are even unique among power-user browsers.</p>

<figure class="resright"><img src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/lambdin-small.jpg" /></figure>

<p>Gothic is a dead language and the only thing existing in it is a
partially translated New Testament by Wulfila. It still is a very
important language for the study of Germanic and Indo-Europeanism
because it is the only language of &quot;Eastern Germanic&quot; so well
attested. Eastern Germanic languages are distinct from other Germanic
languages in their lack of umlaut and some other characteristically
Germanic features, while Gothic still retains some earlier Indo-European
inflectional categories.</p>
<p>I mention Gothic only because one of the best ever language learning
books I've ever seen is written for it, and that is Thomas Lambdin's
<em>Introduction to the Gothic Language</em>. I actually took a Gothic class

everything that exists. These causes answer the question of &quot;How&quot; or
&quot;Why&quot; something is the way it is.</p>
<dl>
<dt>The Material Cause</dt>
<dd>The material from which something is made. E.g. the stone of a
statue.</dd>
<dt>The Efficient Cause</dt>
<dd>The external force that causes something to be made. E.g. the
artisan and his tools who make a statue.</dd>
<dt>The Formal Cause</dt>
<dd>The form or plan of the thing made that define it. E.g. the
artisan's written or thought blueprints or sketch of plans for how
to make the statue.</dd>
<dt>The Final Cause</dt>
<dd>The goal and reason of the thing. E.g. the purpose for which the
artisan is making the statue.</dd>

<p>Most normal people hear the word &quot;cryptocurrency&quot; and assume that

huge, perhaps the hugest misunderstanding of our time and it has some
big consequences. The &quot;crypto&quot; in <em>cryptocurrency</em> merely comes
from its cryptographic nature.</p>
<p>When it comes to actual privacy, cryptocurrencies are an unmitigated
disaster: All transactions and wallet balances are easily viewable on
the necessarily public blockchain.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided after some consideration <strong>to not go to restaurants at all in 2023</strong>.
You can call this a New Year&rsquo;s Resolution.
It&rsquo;ll require at least some sacrifice, pain, annoyance to myself and perhaps others, but I&rsquo;m going to stick by it and I think it will have a good effect.</p>
<p>Restaurants are a drastically over-used creature comfort of the consumerist economy&hellip; even worse, nowadays they&rsquo;re not even comfortable&hellip;</p>
<p>Especially now that portions are smaller more expensive than ever, it&rsquo;s hard to go to a restaurant without feeling cheated.</p>
<p>All of this is fortunate, though, since relying on the ease of restaurants is a vice.
It is now easier than ever to quit it without missing anything but disappointment.</p>

<h2 id="humes-parallel">Hume&rsquo;s Parallel</h2>
<p>David Hume has often been quoted for his <em>&ldquo;Is&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;Ought&rdquo;</em> distinction.
The argument is that fact and morality are two different domains, and from no accumulation of statements of fact alone can we ever jump to a statement of morality.</p>
<p>We can say statements of fact such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>To be murdered is potentially painful.</li>
<li>To be murdered is irreversible.</li>
<li>Murder causes social dysfunction.</li>
<li><em>Etc.</em> &hellip;</li>
</ol>
<p>By merely my collecting these, we haven&rsquo;t proven that <em>Murder is evil.</em>
That is an entirely different statement that cannot be inducted from statements about the description of murder.</p>
<p>Certainly we can derive moral statements from <em>other</em> moral statements accompanied by factual statements. For example, if we assume that the moral statement <em>To kill a living being is immoral.</em> we can derive new moral &ldquo;fact

<p>Just finished by first stream on LBRY/Odysee. If you missed it, don't
sweat it, we didn't talk about anything too interesting, just trying
Odysee's new streaming abilities.</p>
<p>There was some bandwidth problems on my end, but Odysee itself seemed to
handle the stream very well.</p>

<p>For a while, I've hinted that I've been contributing to a project to
reprint out-of-print classical and medieval texts that are of hidden
value, sometimes even in their original languages. I've worked on this
project for a while and now it's live and you can browse the first five
books available.</p>
<p>See the site at <a href="https://lindypress.net">https://lindypress.net</a>. All works have been
reformatted in XeLaTeX so that the text is grade-A in readability and
has nice little flourishes to make it a little more elegant. A lot of
other reprinting companies have their work done with less care.</p>
<p>Here are a list of the books available now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marcus Aurelius's <em>Meditations</em> (in English): a personal log that
Emperor and Stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius kept. This is still
commonly read as a kind of a book of proverbs and motivation, and is
the only book of these where you can commonly find other reprints of
this book, but they usually have textual errors

<p>Although I haven't announced in a video on the YouTube channel yet,
I'm glad that there's been a lot of interest in
<a href="https://lindypress.net">LindyPress.net</a>. I haven't done a video on it
just because there are some details in the site coding we're still
figuring out, but books are already printing, shipping and arriving at
some of your houses.</p>
<p>Just a couple technical notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>I switched the Stripe backend of the site over the weekend. This
makes no changes for you, but if you have site cookies from a
previous visit, it will cause the site to break on checkout. Clear
your cookies for the site or use a private browsing instance to
solve this problem.</li>
<li>We've had a couple errors processing some, but not all
cryptocurrency payments. If you bought books with BTC, ETH or XMR,
just shoot me an email and provide the transaction ID (and exact
amount as well if XMR) and I'll check for you. There's a small
chance that your payment went through, but did not

<p>Back in the not-quite-as-bad-old-days (at least as far back as the
90's), every good website had a small &quot;ad&quot; gif that fans of the site
could use as a colorful link. These are called &quot;buttons&quot; or sometimes
&quot;pins.&quot;</p>
<p>You can see sites that collect these internet artifacts (both the good
ones and boring ones)
<a href="https://anlucas.neocities.org/88x31Buttons.html">here</a> and
<a href="http://cyber.dabamos.de/88x31/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Most people would have <strong>dozens</strong> of these at the bottom of their site,
linking to all their favorite sites, back when people actually linked to
things because search engines hadn't taken over the internet.</p>
<p>The only rules are:</p>
<ol>
<li>It has to be 88 by 31 pixels.</li>
<li>It has to be a .gif.</li>
<li>And it <em>should</em> be animated, colorful or memorable (but some people
do the gray ones to be ironic or boring).</li>

## Important notes for LARBS users

<p>Two notes for <a href="https://larbs.xyz">LARBS</a> users:</p>
<ol>
<li>Xorg went through some updates last week that changed how it
calculates dots-per-inch (DPI) on screens. There's a chance that
you might update and find your font extra large or small. If so, you
can just manually add <code>xrandr --dpi 96</code> to the beginning of your
<code>xprofile</code> to set the DPI to the typical 96 (or whatever number
looks best).</li>
<li>I have no switched new installs of LARBS from using Pulseaudio to
Pipewire as an audio backend, although it will also come with
<code>pipewire-pulse</code> to maintain compatibility with Pulseaudio programs.
If you would like to update the dotfiles, remember to install the
<code>pipewire</code> and <code>pipewire-pulse</code> packages. There should be no major
difference in user experience, although using Pipewire will avoid
some silly Pulseaudio bugs.</li>

## Based.Cooking has become more grandma-usable.

<p>Over the past month, I&rsquo;ve taken some off-time to tinker with
<a href="https://based.cooking">Based.Cooking</a>, the cooking site I/we made a year or so
ago as a proof of concept for a simple and unintrusive recipe website. There
have been over 250 recipes submitted, but the hobbled-together static site
generator originally used proved unable to keep up and with all the
submissions, there was a big issue of content organization.</p>
<p>There have been two big changes. Firstly, I ported the entire site to use Hugo,
which I believe I mentioned already. Hugo is just a very fast static site
generator written in Go, and I particularly liked it for the ease of tagging
articles. Originally, the only content sorting on Based.Cooking was a tagcloud
at the top of the main page and &ldquo;Related&rdquo; pages at the bottom of each page.</p>
<p>Secondly, there had been a PR a while ago to add a search filter for the
mainpage with a few lines of Javascript. I think it&rsquo;s actually a f

<p>Title says the gist.</p>
<p>In 2018, I went to <a href="https://southeastlinuxfest.org/">Southeast Linuxfest</a> and gave a presentation <a href="https://videos.lukesmith.xyz/w/uxiCWDTRHYstoeTQfCg2Fa">which you can see here</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnCXJn2cRf4"><img alt="" src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/yt.svg" /></a>.
It was nice meeting the (shockingly normal) people who knew me from the interest last time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be attending again this year, as the title says June 10-12 in Charlotte, NC.
I&rsquo;ve already had one talk confirmed (and might actually be giving two).</p>
<p>If you are interested in going, <a href="https://southeastlinuxfest.org/">see their site</a>.
The conference itself is at the Sheraton near the Charlotte Airport and <a href="https://www.marriott.com/event-reservations/reservation-link.mi?id=1650480861787&amp;key=GRP&amp;app=resvlink">they still have some rooms on their block left now</a>, but order ASAP if you want to

## Retiring My Fiat Donation Portal

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to retire my fiat donation portal at <a href="https://donate.lukesmith.xyz">donate.lukesmith.xyz</a>, where people could donate to me via debit and credit cards.
<strong>This will happen by the end of this calendar year.</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more in keeping with my principles of free software, self-ownership and everything else to only allow cryptocurrency donations.
This also is a subtle nudge to people who want to donate in streams to get into Bitcoin and Monero, as opposed to using fiat online.
You have no excuse now that they are cheap again!</p>
<p>So the fiat donation portal will open for a couple more weeks.
It still works if you want to give a &ldquo;good-bye&rdquo; donation, but you might want to get some Bitcoin/Monero first if you don&rsquo;t. 😉</p>
<p>Note that I now have my Bitcoin and Monero addresses in the footers of this site now.
Much more minimal than running a payment gateway on a server!</p>

## I'll visit South-East Europe (Greece, Albania, Montenegro, Constantinople) this Summer

<p>I&rsquo;ll be in south eastern Europe this summer (of 2023) in late June and early July.</p>
<p>Specific plans are still in the air, but I&rsquo;ll be visiting Greece, Albania, Montenegro and possibly the European side of Turkey.
I&rsquo;ll also be in Kosovo, and while I know I have some fans in Serbia, I&rsquo;m not sure I can cross into Serbia proper easily since the US accepts Kosovo as independent, but I believe that being there would be an illegal entrance into Serbia in the eyes of the Serbian government.
Not sure about the specifics. You can elucidate me, but either way I&rsquo;ll be in the region.
If you guys start shooting each other, either way, that leg of the journey will be canceled so play nice until after this summer! 😉</p>
<p>I do know some people who live in or frequent the region.
Now is your time to <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/contact">contact me</a> if you&rsquo;ll be there then.
People I don&rsquo;t know are welcome to contact me if they want to arrange a s

<p>Just a brief note that for the past couple of days, you might&rsquo;ve been unable to buy books on <a href="https://lindypress.net">LindyPress.net</a> if you are in the United States, Canada or Australia (which is a lot of you). <strong>This has now been fixed, so you can place your orders now!</strong></p>
<p>The issue was that there was a silent API update that kept addresses from validating states and provinces. <em>Note that if your order placed, it&rsquo;s all okay, this is only for people for whom the site would not let place an order.</em></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a chance that there might&rsquo;ve been another country which might not be validating correctly, so if you input your entire address and get a non-descript error message, just tell me. I&rsquo;ve tried most countries we get the most orders from and they validate fine.</p>
