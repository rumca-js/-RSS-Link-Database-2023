OnePlus posted a video to Weibo of the new impeccably named “Rain Water Touch” feature, which uses a special chip to algorithmically determine when and where your finger is touching the screen, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/08/14/oneplus-touch-screen-wet-demo/">according to <em>9to5Google</em></a>. </p>

  <p id="CAJkeH">Xiaomi has announced a new foldable for Chinese users to consider buying — and for the rest of the world to stare at wistfully from afar. The Mix Fold 3 is going on sale this week starting on August 16th, and based on Xiaomi’s approach with its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356143/xiaomi-mi-mix-fold-folding-phone-announced-price">Mi Mix Fold</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/12/23302758/xiaomi-mix-fold-2-folding-phone-announced">Mix Fold 2</a>, we won’t be holding our collective breath for an international release.</p>
<p id="lNyWXS">The Mix Fold 3’s most eye-catching spec is perhaps the number of folding cycles it’s rated to withstand, which stands at 500,000, according to a certification from TÜV Rheinland. That’s 100,000 higher than the 400,000 of Honor’s recently announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23791047/honor-magic-v2-foldable-china-launch-release-date-price-specs-details-hinge">Magic V2 foldable</a> and over double the 200,000 promised by <a href="https://youtu.be/p_CI3x7AIaQ">Samsung</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23715712/google-pixel-fold-phone-specs-features-price-hands-on#:~:text=The%20hinge%20is%20made,this%20to%20the%20beach.">Google</a> with their 2023 devices.</p>

An exact release date for the feature is yet to be announced, but in a blog post Mozilla’s Scott DeVaney said it should come before the end of the year. More details will be announced next month.</p>
<p id="WmmD8A">With the release, Firefox claims it will be the “only major Android browser to support an open extension ecosystem.” Extensions are currently not supported on Chrome for Android, the OS’s default browser, though <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/chrome-extensions-android-3325587/"><em>Android Authority</em> reports</a> that it’s possible to get them working on smaller browsers like Yandex and Kiwi Browser.
