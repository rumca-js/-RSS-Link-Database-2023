"I Dream About the Wires" by 8bm (aka e!ghtbm), 6th at Assembly Winter 2021.
Art from "Fat Circuits" demo (2023) by Critikill/Rebels. Music ain't from the demo, but the art fits the music nicely imo.

Made using real A1200 Rev. 1D.4 audio. Playback from DeliTracker 2.34 with 14Bit-NotePlayer 4.30:
- 14-bit calibrated Paula output
- Exact interpolation with 44336 Hz mixing frequency
- No panning, no 3D and DSP off. Anti-click enabled
- Module reports 14 channels
- 100% flawless playback not guaranteed (the XM replayer is not perfect)
