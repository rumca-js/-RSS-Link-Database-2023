See my first video on Shorts here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJQRUIIDPMg - YouTube announced over the weekend that Shorts will no longer support external links, a terrible move that will harm creators who rely on affiliate links. Even worse was their official spokesperson's statements on Twitter equating their platform to Instagram / Facebook Reels and TikTok. There has to be a better way.
