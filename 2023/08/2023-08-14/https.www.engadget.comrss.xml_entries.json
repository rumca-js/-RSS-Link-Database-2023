We can now add censorship to that list as the <a href=\"https://globegazette.com/news/local/book-ban-implemented-in-mason-city-school-library/article_1e45064a-386a-11ee-82f7-c3e222c4871a.html\"><em>Globe Gazette </em>reports</a> the <a href=\"https://www.masoncityschools.org/index.php/board-of-education\">school board of Mason City, Iowa</a> has begun leveraging AI technology to cultivate lists of potentially bannable books from the district's libraries ahead of the 2023/24 school year.&nbsp;</p><p>In May, the Republican-controlled state legislature passed, and Governor Kim Reynolds subsequently signed, <a href=\"https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/publications/LGE/90/SF496.pdf\">Senate File 496</a> (SF 496), which enacted sweeping changes to the state's education curriculum. Specifically it limits what books can be made available in school libraries and classrooms, requiring titles to be \"age appropriate\u201d and without \u201cdescriptions or visual depictions of a sex act,\u201d per <a href=\"https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=90&amp;ba=SF496\">Iowa Code 702.17</a>.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>But ensuring that every book in the district's archives adhere to these new rules is quickly turning into a mammoth undertaking. \"Our classroom and school libraries have vast collections, consisting of texts purchased, donated, and found,\" Bridgette Exman, assistant superintendent of curriculum and instruction at Mason City Community School District, said in a statement. \"It is simply not feasible to read every book and filter for these new requirements.\"&nbsp;</p><p>As such, the Mason City School District is bringing in AI to parse suspect texts for banned ideas and descriptions since there are simply too many titles for human reviewers to cover on their own. Per the district, a \"master list\" is first cobbled together from \"several sources\" based on whether there were previous complaints of sexual content. Books from that list are then scanned by \"AI software\" \u2014 the district doesn't specify which systems will be employed \u2014 which tells the state censors whether or not there actually is a depiction of sex in the book.&nbsp;</p><p>\u201cFrankly, we have more important things to do than spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to protect kids from books,\u201d Exman told <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/technology/iowa-chatgpt-book-ban/\"><em>PopSci</em></a> via email. \u201cAt the same time, we do have a legal and ethical obligation to comply with the law. Our goal here really is a defensible process.\u201d</p><p>So far, the AI has flagged 19 books for removal.

Previously, customers had to decide whether to add the option on available models at purchase \u2014 and that decision was final. Now, the service will be installed as standard on all supported vehicles. In addition to enabling it at purchase, owners can add the service later or only activate it for months when needed (like for road trips).</p><p>You\u2019ll still have the option of buying the feature at purchase and folding it into your financing. However, you can now also subscribe to access annually or monthly at any point after that. BlueCruise costs $2,100 at purchase (for three years), while annual subscriptions cost $800 and monthly subscriptions $75. Ford also offers a 90-day free trial if you choose not to set it up at purchase.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The automaker expects to install BlueCruise on 500,000 vehicles in North America for the 2024 model year. That\u2019s a significant ramp-up since it\u2019s currently only installed on less than half of that: 225,000, according to Ford.</p><p>The service\u2019s changes will also apply to Lincolns.

The company says v1.3 lets you keep your hands off the wheel longer. \u201cBased on our internal testing, BlueCruise 1.3 stayed engaged in hands-free mode for an average of 5X longer compared to BlueCruise 1.0, the first version of BlueCruise,\u201d the automaker said.

It has a smaller scope than recent entries, the last of which (<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/assassins-creed-valhalla/\"><em>Assassin's Creed Valhalla</em></a>) can take around 60 hours to beat \u2014 fully completing that game typically takes <a href=\"https://howlongtobeat.com/game/77729\">well over 100 hours</a>. Ubisoft's internal playtests indicate that <em>Mirage </em><a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/assassins-creed-mirage/length\">takes around 20-23 hours to beat</a> and roughly 25-30 hours to fully complete.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/assassin-creed-mirage-2023-release-date-200751800.html\"><em>Mirage</em> is set two decades before <em>Valhalla</em></a> and it takes place primarily in ninth-century Baghdad. There will be a bigger focus on stealth and parkour than in recent Assassin's Creed games, while main character Basim Ibn Ishaq can slow down time to help you plan assassinations. Additionally, <em>Mirage </em>will have a full Arabic-language dub and subtitles, which could help the game feel more immersive.</p><p>Ubisoft has a busy few months ahead.

CEO Andy Jassy said earlier this month that <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/every-amazon-division-is-working-on-generative-ai-projects-142836534.html\">AI is \u201cat the heart of what we do.\u201d</a></p><p>The idea behind the ML-generated summary is to let shoppers get the gist of their peers\u2019 impressions without having to file through a swath of reviews manually. The wrap-up includes a short paragraph describing customer consensus: It\u2019s a bit like an AI-powered version of the \u201cCritics consensus\u201d and \u201cAudience says\u201d blurbs you\u2019d find on <em>Rotten Tomatoes</em>. \u201cCustomers like the stability, ease of use, and performance of the digital device,\u201d one example summary shared by Amazon reads. \u201cThey mention that it\u2019s way faster, the picture / streaming speed is excellent, and it\u2019s a simple device to get connected. They also appreciate the performance, saying that it performs as expected and works great with LG 3D smart TV.\u201d</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The summary is followed by clickable tags showcasing relevant themes and common words from customer reviews. (It\u2019s similar to an existing keyword feature in the company\u2019s reviews.)

Honor still has nothing to worry about when it comes to thinness and lightness, but Xiaomi's latest contender <em>has</em> gained a 5x periscopic zoom camera and, at last, a selfie camera, all of which would seem to address some of the last-gen model's more obvious pain points.&nbsp;</p><p>Another notable addition is 50W wireless charging alongside the original 67W wired option. Depending on which charging method you use, the company says it takes 55 minutes or 40 minutes, respectively, to fully charge the slightly denser 4,800mAh battery. (If you're comparison shopping, Honor forfeited wireless charging on the Magic V2 to meet its aggressive thickness target.) The Mix Fold 3's wireless charging should pair well with Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 \"Leading Version\" processor, with its primary core capable of up to 3.36GHz of clock speed \u2014 handy for video editing on the larger screen.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img alt=\"The innards of the rear Leica cameras on the Xiaomi Mix Fold 3.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/67a1ae70-3aa8-11ee-a6e9-6b81eb7fcdaa\" style=\"height: 1000px; width: 1600px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Xiaomi</div></figure><p>Thanks to its beefed-up camera setup, the Mix Fold 3 packs a total of four Leica-enhanced on the rear: a 50-megapixel f/1.77 main camera (Sony IMX800, 23mm equivalent) with optical stabilization, a 12-megapixel f/2.2 ultra-wide camera (15mm equivalent), a 10-megapixel telephoto camera (75mm equivalent) and the handy new 10-megapixel f/2.92 periscope camera (115mm equivalent).&nbsp;</p><p>Like before, you can always toggle the external screen to leverage any of these rear-facing cameras for better selfies, but for general video conferencing, you now have the option to toggle between the 20-megapixel front cameras on <em>both</em> the 6.56-inch external screen (2,520 x 1,080, 120Hz) and 8.025-inch flexible screen (2,160 x 1,916, 120Hz).&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt=\"Xiaomi's new hinge on the Mix Fold 3 versus its predecessor.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/c65babb0-3aa7-11ee-9ffe-6fdd73e606d6\" style=\"height: 675px; width: 1080px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Xiaomi</div></figure><p>The screen sizes here are practically identical to the last-gen model, except both are now upgraded with Samsung's E6 OLED display technology for improved efficiency and outdoor visibility; you get up to 2,600 nits of peak brightness on the external panel.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, with Xiaomi's improved hinge, the company can finally disclose a durability figure of 500,000 folds (certified by T\u00dcV Rheinland).

It\u2019s an effort to digitize and preserve recordings on old 78 RPM records, a format discontinued in 1959. The labels feel the Archive, the closest thing the web has to a public library, is infringing its copyrights after digitizing tracks from big names like Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday. And the labels are asking for damages of $150,000 per still-copyrighted recording \u2013 the better part of $372 million in total.</p><p>The project\u2019s aim is to preserve \u201cunderrepresented artists and genres\u201d that might otherwise languish in obscurity. For all the songs of yore that still linger in the public\u2019s consciousness, there are countless more now consigned to the dustbin of history. For them, the best-case scenario is their publisher properly stores the masters in case there\u2019s ever a need to reproduce them. But given how easy it is for a company to junk material for a tax write-off, like in the recent case of Warner Bros., we can no longer rely on companies to treat their own history with the proper respect.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t help that 78s are notoriously fragile, and if work to digitize them isn\u2019t handled properly, their material could be lost forever. If we\u2019re being honest, most of it is probably now only of interest to historians as a snapshot of what culture was<em> really</em> like.
