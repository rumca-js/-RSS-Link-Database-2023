## Burnout because of ChatGPT?
 - [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37126182](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37126182)
 - RSS feed: https://hnrss.org/frontpage
 - date published: 2023-08-14T20:10:51+00:00

<p>TL;DR (summarised by ChatGPT) - I'm experiencing increased productivity and independence with ChatGPT but grappling with challenges such as lack of work-life boundaries and overwhelming information, leading to stress and burnout.<p>Long story...<p>I have been using ChatGPT for a while, and moved to the Plus subscription for their GPT-4 model, which I must say, is quite good.<p>1. ChatGPT makes us very productive. Personally, in my early 40s, I feel my brain is back in 20s.<p>2. I no longer feel the need to hire juniors. This is a short-term positive and maybe a long-term negative.
[[EDIT: I may have implied a wrong meaning. To clarify - nobody's going yet because of ChatGPT. It is just raising the bar high and higher. What took me years to learn, this thing can do already and much more. And I cannot predict the financial future of OpenAI or the markets in general.]]<p>A lot of stuff I used to delegate to fellow humans are now being delegated to ChatGPT. And I can get the results immediately and at any time I want. I agree that it cannot operate on its own. I still need to review and correct things. I have do that even when working with other humans. The only difference is that I can start trusting a human to improve, but I cannot expect ChatGPT to do so. Not that it is incapable, but because it is restricted by OpenAI.<p>And I have gotten better at using it. Calling myself a prompt-engineer sounds weird.<p>With all the good, I am now experiencing the cons, stress and burnout:<p>1. Humans work 9-5 (or some schedule), but ChatGPT is available always and works instantly. Now, when I have some idea I want to try out - I start working on it immediately with the help of AI. Earlier I just used to put a note in the todo-list and stash it for the next day.<p>2. The outputs with ChatGPT are so fast, that my "review load" is too high. At times it feels like we are working for ChatGPT and not the other way around.<p>3. ChatGPT has the habit of throwing new knowledge back at you. Google does that too, but this feels 10x of Google. Sometimes it is overwhelming. Good thing is we learn a lot, bad thing is that if often slows down our decision making.<p>4. I tried to put a schedule to use it - but when everybody has access to this tech, I have a genuine fear of missing out.<p>5. I have zero doubt that AI is setting the bar high, and it is going to take away a ton of average-joe desk jobs. GPT-4 itself is quite capable and organisations are yet to embrace it.<p>And not the least, it makes me worry - what lies with the future models. I am not a layman when it comes to AI/ML - have worked with it until the past few years in the pre-GPT era.<p>Has anybody experienced these issues? And how do you deal with those?<p>* I could not resist asking ChatGPT the above - couple of strategies it told me were to "Seek Support from Others" and "Participating in discussions or groups focused on ethical AI". *</p>

## Show HN: LLMs can generate valid JSON 100% of the time
 - [https://github.com/normal-computing/outlines](https://github.com/normal-computing/outlines)
 - RSS feed: https://hnrss.org/frontpage
 - date published: 2023-08-14T18:52:54+00:00

<p>Outlines is a Python library that focuses on text generation with large language models. Brandon and I are not LLM experts and started the project a few months ago because we wanted to understand better how the generation process works. Our original background is probabilistic, relational and symbolic programming.<p>Recently we came up with a fast way to generate text that matches a regex (<a href="https://blog.normalcomputing.ai/posts/2023-07-27-regex-guided-generation/regex-guided-generation.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://blog.normalcomputing.ai/posts/2023-07-27-regex-guide...</a>). The basic idea is simple: regular expressions have an equivalent Deterministic-Finite Automaton (DFA) representation. We can transform this DFA into a generative model: in each state we get a list of symbols which correspond to completions that partially match the regular expression. We mask the other symbols in the logits returned by a large language model, sample a new symbol and move to the next state. The subtelty is that language models work with tokens, not symbols, so we derive a new FSM whose alphabet is the model's vocabulary. We can do this in only one pass over the vocabulary.<p>Generating the token masks thus only requires a dictionary lookup at each state. Our method blows other libraries like Microsoft's guidance out of the water.<p>From there it was only a small leap to be able to generate text that follows a JSON schema (<a href="https://json-schema.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://json-schema.org/</a>), or is parseable into a Pydantic model (<a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/usage/models/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/usage/models/</a>). The method works with union types, optional types, nested schemas, arrays, everything. It is guaranteed that the output is parseable.<p>I think it's cool, and I've spent a lot of time watching even tiny models output valid JSON over the weekend. Hope you will too.<p>I look forward to feedback, bug reports, feature requests and discussions!<p>Edit: Link to our pre-print explaining the method and how this can be extended to generate text that follows a Context-Free Grammar <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09702" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09702</a></p>

## Show HN: Epsilla – Open-source vector database with low query latency
 - [https://github.com/epsilla-cloud/vectordb](https://github.com/epsilla-cloud/vectordb)

<p>Hey HN! We are building Epsilla (<a href="https://github.com/epsilla-cloud/vectordb">https://github.com/epsilla-cloud/vectordb</a>), an open-source, self-hostable vector database for semantic similarity search that specializes in low query latency.<p>When do we need a vector database? For example, GPT-3.5 has a 16k context window limit. If we want to let it answer a question about a 300 page book, we cannot put the whole book content into the context. We have to choose the sections of the book that are most relevant to the question. Vector database is specialized at ranking and picking the most relevant content from a large pool of documents based on their semantic similarity.<p>Most vector databases utilize hierarchical navigational small world (HNSW) for indexing the vectors for high precision vector search, and its latency significantly degrades when the precision target is higher than 95%.<p>At a previous company, we worked on building the parallel graph traversal engine. We realized that the bottleneck of HNSW performance is because there are too many sequential traversal steps that don't fully leverage multi-core CPU computation resources. After some research, we found that there are algorithms such as SpeedANN that are targeting this problem, which is not leveraged by industry yet. So we built the Epsilla vector database to turn the research into a production system.<p>With Epsilla, we shoot for 10x lower vector search latency compared to HNSW based vector databases. We did an initial benchmark against the top open source vector databases: <a href="https://medium.com/@richard_50832/benchmarking-epsilla-with-some-of-the-top-vector-databases-543e2b7708e5" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://medium.com/@richard_50832/benchmarking-epsilla-with-...</a><p>We provide a Docker image for you to install Epsilla backend locally, and provide a Python client and a JavaScript client to connect and interact with it.<p>Quickstart:<p><pre><code>      docker pull epsilla/vectordb

      docker run --pull=always -d -p 8888:8888 epsilla/vectordb

      pip install pyepsilla

      git clone https://github.com/epsilla-cloud/epsilla-python-client.git

      cd examples

      python hello_epsilla.py

</code></pre>
We just started a month ago. We'd love to hear what you think, and more importantly, what you wish to see in the future. We are thinking about a serverless vector database on cloud with a consumption based pricing model, and we are eager to get your feedback.</p>

<p>Hi!
"Another chatbot for your content" you may ask? Not really! Let me explain.<p>I have realized that there's an untapped potential for ChatGPT plugins: why leave them locked up in the OpenAI store? Let's embed them on websites or share using links!<p>Let's make chatbots ~ do stuff ~, not just talk about what they know.<p>That's how Chatwith was born. It is a chat widget, it scrapes your website, knowledge page, notion etc - but more importantly, it also understands your API. It can interact with that API on your or your visitors' behalf.<p>Some use cases & ideas:<p>- Shopify bot - ask it for order status and invoice<p>- Realtor - ask for budget, provide listings<p>- Survey - ask questions, collect answers, submit to Typeform<p>- Airline service - get your boarding pass<p>- Mixpanel - talk to your analytics<p>In other words:<p>- Talk to APIs & hot data<p>- ChatGPT plugin on every website<p>- Your SaaS can be a chatbot<p>- APIs made accessible (they were reserved for devs until now)<p>- Create an API, use chat as the interface - skip the frontend<p>I am trying to envision a future where website visitors are empowered to just say what they want from the business - instead of navigating endless dashboards and documentation.<p>I'm looking for some feedback about my product! lmk<p>Rafal</p>

<p>Hi HN<p>I needed a way to monitor network calls made by chrome extensions so I made a small extension.<p>You can install it by dropping the zip or crx into the extensions page. It'll be on the chrome store whenever/if it gets through the review.<p>Hopefully it's useful to others.<p><a href="https://github.com/dnakov/little-rat">https://github.com/dnakov/little-rat</a><p><a href="https://twitter.com/dnak0v" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://twitter.com/dnak0v</a></p>

## Launch HN: Serra (YC S23) – Open-source, Python-based dbt alternative

<p>Hey HN! Alan and Albert here, cofounders of Serra. Serra is end-to-end dbt—we make building reliable, scalable ELT/ETL easy by replacing brittle SQL scripts with object-oriented Python. It’s open source: <a href="https://github.com/Serra-Technologies/serra">https://github.com/Serra-Technologies/serra</a>, and our docs are here: <a href="https://docs.serra.io/documentation/">https://docs.serra.io/documentation/</a>.<p>I stumbled into this idea as a data engineer for Disney+’s subscriptions team. We were “firefighters for data,” ready to debug huge pipelines that always crashed and burned. The worst part of my job at Disney+ was the graveyard on-call rotations, where pagers from 12am to 5am were guaranteed, and you'd have to dig through thousands of lines of someone else’s SQL. 
SQL is long-winded—1000 lines of SQL can often be summarized with 10 key transforms. We take this SQL and summarize those transforms with reusable, testable, scalable Spark objects.<p>Serra is written in PySpark and modularizes every component of ETL through Spark objects. Similar to dbt, we apply software engineering best practices to data, but we aim to do it not just with transformations, but with data connectors as well.
We accomplish this with a configuration YAML file—the idea is if we have a pipeline with said 1000 line SQL script that is using third-party connectors, we can summarize all of this into a 12-block config file that gives easy high-level overhead and debugging capabilities—10 blocks for the transforms and 2 for the in-house connectors. Then, we can add tests and custom alerts to each of these objects/blocks so that we know where exactly the pipeline breaks and why.<p>We are open-source to make it easy to customize Serra to whatever flavor you like with custom transformers/connectors. The connectors we support OOB are Snowflake, AWS, BigQuery, and Databricks and are adding more based on feedback. The transforms we support include mapping, pivoting, joining, truncating, imputing, and more. 
We’re doing our best to make Serra as easy to use as possible. If you have docker installed, you can run this docker command to instantly get setup with a Serra environment to create modular pipelines.<p>We wrap up our functionality with a command line tool that lets you: - create your ETL pipelines, test them locally with a subset of your data, and deploy them to the cloud (currently we only support Databricks, but will soon support others and plan to host our own clusters too). It also has an experimental “translate” feature which is still a bit finicky, but the idea is to take your existing SQL script and get suggestions on how you can chunk up and modularize your job with our config. It’s still just a super early suggestion feature that is definitely not fleshed out, but we think it’s a cool approach.<p>Here’s a quick demo going through retooling a long-winded SQL script to an easily maintainable, scalable ETL job: <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/acc633c0ec03455e9e8837f5c3db3165?sid=341c529c-1c4a-41b2-85c4-ca8589ff965a" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.loom.com/share/acc633c0ec03455e9e8837f5c3db3165?...</a>. (docker command: docker run --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/app -it serraio/serra /bin/bash)<p>We don’t see or store any of your data—we’re a transit layer that helps you write ETL jobs that you can send to your warehouse of choice with your actual data. Right now we are helping customers retool their messy data pipelines and plan to monetize by hosting Serra on the cloud, charging if you run the job on our own clusters, and per API call on our translate feature (once it’s mature).<p>We’re super excited to launch this to Hacker News. We’d love to hear what you think. Thanks in advance!</p>
