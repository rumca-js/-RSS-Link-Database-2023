		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/incode-technologies">Incode Technologies</a> has sealed a deal that will help the Californian company offer its identity verification services to the U.S. public sector.

Incode has struck a partnership with <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/carahsoft">Carahsoft</a> which sells IT and consulting services to federal, state and local governments as well as educational and health institutions.

This has placed the company among names such as <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202304/passwordless-authentication-vendors-cuddle-up-for-market-warmth-and-fatter-revenues">Nok Nok</a>, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202304/id-me-expands-biometric-access-for-government-agencies-via-carahsoft-partnership">ID.me</a>, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202304/carahsoft-okta-socure-partner-to-fight-fraud-against-us-government">Okta and Socure</a> which have also signed deals with Virginia-based Carahsoft this year to address public sector needs for digital identity and verification. In February, the White House allocated <a href="https://fedscoop.com/biden-administration-allocates-300m-to-help-federal-agencies-modernize-id-verification-technology/">$300 million</a> to help federal agencies modernize ID verification technology.

The partnership will make Incode’s products available to Carahsoft's reseller partners, including procurement companies such as NASPO ValuePoint, the contracting arm of the National Association of State Procurement Officials (NASPO), the National Cooperative Purchasing Alliance (NCPA) and OMNIA Partners.

"This agreement will broaden access to our omnichannel biometric identity solutions through Carahsoft's vast network of contract vehicles to help eliminate identity fraud and improve equitable services access within the public sector," CEO and founder of Incode Ricardo Amper says in a statement.

Among Incode’s offerings is its Omni platform which includes remote identity verification, risk assessment and authentication. Last week, the platform received assurance from the <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative,</a> an international, non-profit association that assesses identity services for conformance with NIST 800-63-3 standards.

Kantara's Trust Mark proves that Incode Omni meets digital identity management recommendations set by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The Identity Assurance Level 2 (IAL2) compliance affirms Incode's dedication to providing solutions that put people first, Amper said in a release. The company has previously passed the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/201910/startup-incode-gets-10b-in-seed-funding-and-launches-biometric-omnichannel-id-platform">iBeta test</a> for passive liveness detection based on the ISO/IEC standard.

This year, Incode has been making deals that have <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/selfie-biometrics-and-kyc-checks-further-expand-beyond-banking">expanded its presence</a> in markets such as New Zealand and Europe, the Middle East and Africa region (EMEA). Among its fresh partnerships are those with U.S. property management firm <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/selfie-biometrics-and-kyc-checks-further-expand-beyond-banking">Snappt</a>, South African fintech service provider <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/trust-issues-hamper-adoption-of-biometrics-says-incode-report">Mama Money</a> and blockchain firm Black Ink Tech.

The company has raised over <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202112/big-funding-bump-for-biometric-id-verification-player-incode">$220 million</a> from investors such as General Atlantic, Softbank and JP Morgan.

## Mixed start for privacy advocates fighting US age verification rules for adult content

		Legal strategies are being formed to prevent U.S. states from imposing new restrictions, including age-verification policies, on online publishers of adult content.

Publishers don't want more restrictions on their product, of course, but others say blocking content violates the nation's constitutional right to create and consume information without undue government intervention.

Others feel governments and other organizations will collect, keep and use identification data without consent or adequate security.

Utah's new law requiring adult sites to prove their visitors are not minors easily withstood its first court challenge this month when a lawsuit opposing the regulation was dismissed.

The U.S. District Court judge ruled narrowly against advocates like Free Speech <a href="https://www.freespeechcoalition.com/">Coalition</a>, an association promoting the interests of what it describes as the adult industry.

Utah's law does not give the state the power to go after publishers for not checking ages. It gives citizens the power to do that, according to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/utah-law-requiring-age-verification-porn-sites-remains-101927363">reporting</a> by U.S. network news broadcaster ABC. The state, which was the target of the suit, can't be taken to court for enforcing a law it cannot itself enforce.

Last week, an adult content publisher, Pornhub, and some privacy advocates, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkazpy/pornhub-sues-texas-over-age-verification-law">filed suit</a> to stop Texas from doing the same thing. The Free Speech Coalition joined with Pornhub to stop the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23905744-texas-complaint">Texas</a> law from becoming law September 1.

According to <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkazpy/pornhub-sues-texas-over-age-verification-law">reporting</a> by technology culture publication Vice, the law's opponents in court say age verification violates the Constitution and the U.S. Communications Decency Act.

Texas' law is considered highly similar to a pioneering regulation enacted in neighboring Louisiana. Legislators there <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202301/protect-kids-or-avoid-censorship-id-verification-debate-warms-in-us">folded</a> their age verification strategy into <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202210/1-5m-in-louisiana-carry-an-mdl">its mobile driver's license</a>.

Multiple states <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/battle-over-age-verification-heats-up-in-increasingly-censorious-us">are working</a> on restrictions, most efforts involve requiring people to prove their ages with face biometrics.

## Juul plans to re-enter US with age verification e-cigarettes

		Electronic cigarette maker Juul says it has improved its product with an age-verification app in the hopes of getting re-authorized in the United States.

The nation's Food and Drug Administration ordered Juul to stop selling its vapes a year ago. The primary reason for the ban, according to the FDA, was that the science behind healthful claims was unconvincing.

It did not help that Juul's ads often were reminiscent of now-banned cigarette messaging, which often make smoking look sophisticated, fun and adult to young people.

The company is trying to win FDA permission for sales with a number of <a href="https://www.juullabs.com/next-generation-platform-pmta/">design changes</a> including age verification.

Few details of how this would work are provided, but Juul reportedly will use a selfie compared to a government ID. Purchasing one of the company's cigarettes also will require a photo of an ID. Once verified, the devices will be unlocked via Bluetooth connection.

Juul noted that identity and age verification for its online sales are provided by <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/jumio">Jumio</a>’s face biometrics software NetVerify and <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/veratad">Veratad</a>’s AgeMatch in a <a href="https://www.juullabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/JUUL-Labs-Canada-BC-Submission-FINAL-Jan-22.pdf">2020 submission</a> to a government official of the Canadian province of British Columbia.

Fingerprint scans as a key to unlock vapes go back at least to 2014.

It is not known when the FDA will take a second look at the devices.

## Biometric tokenization patents given to Trust Stamp

		Two U.S. patents for biometric identification, one for biometric tokenization, have been awarded to software maker Trust Stamp.

The <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/trust-stamp-gains-approval-for-a-new-patent-around-lossy-biometric-representation">first patent</a> (11,741,263), published last week, protects “systems and processes for lossy biometric representation.” It's now part of <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/trust-stamp">Trust Stamp</a>'s line of products that tokenize biometric data.

Tokenizing biometric data makes a fingerprint, for example, an abstract, anonymized vector image, eliminating exposure of the biometric. This process is also designed to be hard to reconstruct the original stored information used to create the token.

The vector image is compared to others to verify identity.

The patented process has been integrated into the company’s irreversibly transformed ID token, or <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202209/trust-stamp-launches-privacy-centric-biometric-solution-for-government-customers">IT2</a>, software, which minimizes storage and use of biometric template.

Also, this month, Trust Stamp won protection for privacy-secured biometric ID and verification (<a href="https://ppubs.uspto.gov/pubwebapp/external.html?q=(11711216).pn.&amp;amp;db=USPAT&amp;amp;type=ids">11,711,216</a>). It is a biometric enrollment system, also part of the company's IT2 portfolio, can produce multiple transformed, privacy-secured templates for storage.

The company also increased its customer base by 31 percent over the six months prior to August 1, according to an announcement.

## Czech data protection authorities question police use of facial recognition

		Police use of facial recognition technology has come under the scrutiny of data protection authorities in another country, this time Czechia.

The Czech Office for Personal Data Protection has asked the local police for information on the facial recognition system that has been in trial operation for almost a year. One of the main issues highlighted is that the police did not bother to consult the data protection office during its testing, according to the office spokesperson Milan Řepka.

"We are currently assessing the matter," Řepka <a href="https://www.novinky.cz/clanek/domaci-policie-skenuje-obliceje-urad-resi-zda-muze-40440145">told</a> news outlet Novinky.cz.

The news comes after non-profit organization Iuridicum Remedium (IuRe) brought attention to the system, named DOP (Digitálních podob osob) in July, <a href="https://digitalnisvobody.cz/blog/2023/07/12/tz-policie-jiz-temer-rok-vyuziva-analyticky-nastroj-na-rozpoznavani-tvari-podrobnosti-jeho-fungovani-ale-pred-verejnosti-taji/">revealing</a> that it is operated based on internal instructions of the Chief of Police which were not made public.

The system was supplied by Czech IT infrastructure company <a href="https://www.autocont.com/">Autocont</a> and has been in operation since August 2022, according to materials obtained by the NGO through a Freedom of Information Access (FOIA) request. The price tag for the system was 1,400,000 Czech korunas (around US$63,500) excluding VAT, a contract dating from 2020 shows. The documents did not reveal the maker of the facial recognition software.

The facial recognition system relies on images from government identity card and travel document registers. In its report, the organization warns about the system’s privacy implications, adding that it could also be used for monitoring people’s activities, including those online.

The Czech police have defended the use of the system referring to Section 66a of the Police Act which allows retroactive comparison of images with photographs from government sources such as ID records.

"The DPO system is used for comparing <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/?posttype=all&amp;s=retrospective">retrospectively</a> ad hoc faces from specific serious cases and for identifying dead people of unknown identity," police spokesperson Jakub Vinčálek <a href="https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/policie-nastroje-rozpoznavani-tvari-fotografie-obcani-statni-registr.A230720_193057_domaci_itimp">clarified</a> for local outlet Idnes.cz in July.

But local lawyers are questioning whether the system is exceeding the police’s legal authorities.

IuRe attorney Jan Vobořil argues that the law only covers the use of images but not biometric identification. Other legal experts such as Ondřej Preuss say that the mass use of CCTV surveillance requires a new legal framework, even if the images are only used by the facial recognition system retroactively. The issue is also attracting scrutiny from the Czech Pirate Party.

Meanwhile, the Czech Office for Personal Data Protection noted that it has been working on a new methodology for camera systems since April of this year.

"The document is not yet valid, it is still in the process of evaluating comments," says spokesman Řepka.

## Kenya signs digital ID support deal with UNDP, introduces a new Namba

		A Memorandum of Understanding has been signed between Kenya and the United Nation’s Development Programme to support the country’s digital identity program, which has a new name, reports <a href="https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2023/08/kenya-undp-sign-mou-on-digital-id-development-ahead-of-october-rollout/">Capital News</a>.

The Unique Personal Identifier (UPI) which has been presented by the Kenyan government elected last year as a replacement for the scuttled Huduma Namba will be known as “Maisha Namba.”

“Maisha” in Swahili translates to “life” in English, while the “huduma” in Huduma Namba translates to “services.”

Maisha Namba and an accompanying digital ID are now scheduled to be presented on October 2.

An immigration department official told <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/92093-maisha-namba-govt-unveils-new-name-digital-id-after-signing-deal-un">Kenyans.co.ke</a> that “Maisha Namba will be a number that will replace the current birth entry number which is currently issued with birth certificates. Maisha Namba will be the reference number for future identity for all subsequent stages: school, national ID, KRA pin."

A “Maisha Card” will be issued under the new system, and a National Master Population Register established to consolidate government databases. This was a key takeaway identified by Principal Secretary of Immigration and Citizen Services Julius Bitok from a <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/kenya-seeks-nadra-collaboration-expertise-on-digital-id-project">visit to NADRA</a> in Pakistan.

“The digital identity system will provide Kenyans with a secure and reliable way to verify their identity for a variety of purposes, including accessing gov't services, opening bank accounts, and traveling,” says Bitok in a <a href="https://twitter.com/JuliusKBitok/status/1690999348094533632?t=PJ5YIyQUgD6AgOngqGTy-w&amp;s=19">tweet</a>. “It will also help to reduce fraud and corruption, and improve efficiency.”

Bitok says the digital ID will enable Kenyans to carry out online transactions with service providers from around the world. The Maisha Namba will also be used by the National Health Insurance Fund and Kenya Revenue Authority, according to <a href="https://www.pulselive.co.ke/news/local/details-of-maisha-namba-that-government-plans-to-roll-out-in-october/7bbtqeb">Pulselive Kenya</a>.

UNDP Resident Representative Anthony Ngororano praised Kenya’s government for engaging with non-governmental organizations, and said UNDP intends to ensure “a whole of society approach” to implementing the national digital ID.

## Rate of foreigners acquiring Ugandan national ID is alarming, govt official warns

		A spokesman for Uganda’s Internal Affairs Ministry, Simon Peter Mundeyi, says the rate at which foreign nationals bribe their way to obtain the country’s national ID card is worrisome.

At a recent weekly security briefing, Mundeyi said authorities had identified up to 10,000 cards issued to foreigners which have to be destroyed, The Monitor <a href="https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/news/national/govt-to-destroy-10-000-id-cards-owned-by-foreigners-4329968">reports</a>.

According to the spokesperson, foreigners mostly took advantage of the non-existence of a central database to defraud the ID-issuing authority, with some of the ineligible applicants disguising as Ugandans. He said there have also been reports of such foreigners using agents to bribe immigration officers.

He said some of the foreigners who come from countries such as Burundi, China, India, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda and South Sudan, seek to establish a Ugandan ID so as to obtain its passport.

Mundeyi cited a recent case in which two Nigerians and a Congolese were caught with Ugandan IDs trying to acquire the passport.

“The number of foreign nationals with Uganda national IDs has continued to increase and we are worried this could go up to the 2026 elections,” the official said, as quoted by The Monitor.

The Internal Affairs Ministry and the National Identification and Registration Authority (NIRA) have been working to identify, withdraw and destroy all cards obtained fraudulently by foreigners residing in Uganda.

Mundeyi noted that in some instances in the past, foreigners obtaining Ugandan ID have used the credentials to commit crime such as drug trafficking.

Another Ugandan interviewed by The Monitor expressed concern that some naturalized citizens of the country could be included in the cull, despite qualifying for the ID card.

Uganda has plans to introduce a new biometric ID card system next year, but a report by the country’s Auditor General early this year suggested the plan may not materialize due to <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202304/uganda-new-id-plans-reportedly-stalled-3m-current-cards-unclaimed">significant delays</a>. NIRA said at the time that its plans remain and that enrollment for the new generation IDs was due to begin this month.

## Filipino lawmakers deplore missed target for biometric ID card production

		The House Committee on Appropriations of the Philippines parliament has been told that only 36 million physical ID cards (PhilID) have been printed to date, out of an expected 92 million.

During a recent budget hearing, the Appropriations Committee members learnt that the company contracted by the Central Bank of the Philippines (BSP) for the job, produced only 80,000 biometric ID cards a day, out of the expected 126,000 daily target, Manila Bulleting <a href="https://mb.com.ph/2023/8/11/only-36-m-physical-national-i-ds-produced-house-panel-learns-in-budget-hearing">reports</a>.

Asked why the company failed to meet the target, the BSP Assistant Governor Iluminada Sicat said it was as a result of many factors which included operational difficulties like design changes and personalization processes.

The Philippines Statistics Authority (PSA) Chief Dennis Mapa also explained that a key design change issue contributed to the delay. This involved making changes to information in the card’s QR code.

During the briefing, the Appropriations Committee Chair Stella Luz Quimbo asked that a full report on the evolution of the PhilID project be submitted to the panel.

The government has earmarked 1.61 billion Philippine pesos (US$28 million) in the national budget to fund the PhilSys digital ID system, which includes the PhilID, according to the PNA.

Meanwhile, the PSA says it is investigating the discovery of national ID cards found in a garbage disposal site at a town in the Negros Occidental Province.

In a news release, PSA Chief Mapa said they are working in collaboration with the Philippine Postal Corporation on the probe and they commit to addressing any gaps found in the card delivery system.

The PSA also reassured of its commitment to ensuring the safety of all data collected from registrants.

“The privacy and security of the data of PhilSys-registered persons is of the highest priority, and strict protocols in the distribution of PhilIDs and ePhilIDs have been in place since the beginning of its distribution.”

“The PSA remains strongly committed to its mandate of ensuring the security of registered persons' data from the first step of registration up to the distribution of PhilIDs and ePhilIDs.”

Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.rappler.com/nation/visayas/psa-probes-discovery-of-national-ids-found-in-negros-occidental-garbage-dump/">Rappler</a> notes that there were 87 discarded IDs in all, three of them being PVC-type cards.

The PSA says <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/over-70-million-philids-issued-as-psa-philippines-post-re-commit-to-delivery">over 70 million PhilIDs</a> have been issued.

## Align liveness detection with cybersecurity best practices to stop generative AI

		Generative AI is being used to fuel a range of fraud attacks, from fake kidnappings to digital injection attacks against biometric systems. To <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/iproov-limited">iProov</a> Founder and CEO <a href="https://www.iproov.com/about-us/iproov-leadership">Andrew Bud</a>, the implications are far-reaching and incredibly serious, but he is not surprised.

“It was very clear that this was coming. And if it’s unchecked, I think it presents a threat to the stability of society,” Bud told <em>Biometric Update</em> in an interview.

Social interactions and transactions occur remotely with ever-more frequency, and are only possible given a sufficient amount of trust. Recent developments in AI threaten that trust.

“In the end this is going to come down to biometrics and trust in biometrics,” Bud says.

Trust in biometrics comes from liveness assurance, which includes presentation attack detection (PAD), but also the ability to defend against injection attacks, which Bud calls “the real threat.” It was Bud who revealed last October that injection attacks are <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202210/digital-injection-6x-more-frequent-than-biometric-presentation-attacks">already more common</a> than presentation attacks.

The challenge with deepfakes is that they can be used to attack video selfie systems that are relatively resilient against traditional presentation attacks, via injection with camera emulators.

“Most industry players who claim to defend against deepfakes today actually rely upon stopping it at the source, upon detecting it in the device,” according to Bud.

This is insufficient, he says, because the relatively primitive injection attacks seen until recently could be spotted by legacy technology and by people. Generative AI gets ten times harder every year, Bud estimates, and iProov has observed successful attacks that evaded on-device detection methods by “endpoints that look like mobile devices but aren’t.”
<h2>“A fundamentally different approach”</h2>
Injection attacks and generative AI represent “a different kind of problem from the liveness problem, the presentation attack problem,” Bud says.

These attacks must be detected “in the cloud, based on information in the biometrics, and to do so in a dynamic and continually adaptive way.”

But what technology is capable of identifying these attacks?

“You need a fundamentally different approach to solving a moving-target problem like that than  a stationary target problem like good old presentation attacks,” Bud says.

That approach is based on continuous monitoring and adaptation, more like the dominant paradigm in the broader cybersecurity space.

Bud argues that “almost nobody apart from iProov actually has any visibility of real attacks.” He attributes this advantage to the combination of cloud processing and the company’s <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202009/iproov-facility-secures-biometric-assurance-tech-manages-threats-from-cyber-attacks">Security Operations Centre</a>, launched in 2020.

“We and we alone process every liveness transaction in the cloud, and monitor and manage them through active threat intelligence,” Bud states. “We’re the only operators in the world with a biometric security operations center. We’re the only company that analyzes every transaction attempt done anywhere in the world on any of our customers to look for signals of attack and novel mode attacks.”

Building the system, which “captures everything in the world,” was difficult and expensive, Bud says, perhaps explaining why the move has not been replicated.

Vendors who sell software to run on-premises have “no visibility whatsoever of the evolving scenario,” Bud argues. “There is no knowledge of when and how exploits are being found, and there is absolutely no mechanism for feeding back information about those exploits into adaptations in the software.” Further, he believes software sold to run on-prem inevitably makes its way into attackers’ hands.

He refers to those kinds of biometric solutions as “zero-day exploit machines.”

Analysis of attacks in the wild is used to inform the evolution of iProov’s systems and technology, according to Bud.

“Only a system that does this can be trusted, because in the world of generative AI, we’re up against immense resources available to the attackers – many of them are nation states – with world-class skills and technology.”

The volume of monitoring iProov carries out gives it “an informational advantage” or “information asymmetry,” Bud says. “Every time they attack us, we learn more about them then they learn about us. We see everything about their attack.”

The bottom line for Bud is that the common perception of technologies as “the vulnerable and the invulnerable” is “completely untrue.”

“The question is: How does the system respond to those exploits?” he explains.
<h2>Fraud risk and modality</h2>
Bud pushes back against another common perception about biometrics, arguing that credential compromise consists of something secret becoming public.

“No biometric should be considered secret” he says. Biometric security does not depend on secrecy, just genuineness. Therefore all biometric security depends on the ability to detect forgery, he reasons. Those who provide that security have to find buried signals of falseness within data.

This gives face an inherent advantage over other biometric modalities, Bud says.

His explanation draws on time spent in voice communications prior to founding iProov.

Facial images have megabytes of data, while voice is transmitted using the GSM half rate codec, which is 12.5 kbps. Stakeholders can only demand more data by excluding those with low-bandwidth handsets or low-bandwidth networks.

That rate was chosen “based on modelling of human vocal tract,” and according to Bud, “generative AI doesn’t struggle much with simulating that.”

“The fundamental problem you’ve got is that is not enough to find the increasingly weak signals of falseness,” due to increasing generative AI capabilities, Bud explains.

Security will increasingly have to rely on one-time biometrics, he asserts.

And effective, adaptable, responsive, actively threat-monitored liveness is fundamental to sustaining trust in the context of rapidly developing generative AI.
<h2>Assessing process, rather than tech</h2>
This also makes assessment becomes a different kind of challenge.

“What we’re seeing at the moment is: the only way in which you as a buyer can trust that you are buying a reliable liveness solution that is robust against injection attacks is to look at who has already reviewed and tested and bought the technology who has the resources themselves to independently test it.”

Bud gives the U.S. federal government as an example. iProov went through a 3-month “federal intelligence contractor red team exercise” while being considered as a <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202303/iproov-awarded-nearly-750k-by-dhs-st-in-fifth-phase-funding">federal technology supplier</a>. A team of 8 people were dedicated to assessing iProov’s vulnerability to deepfakes during this process, Bud says.

Private companies can’t afford to do that in most cases, though ING, iProov’s first customer, hired “national security level pentester” <a href="https://outflank.nl/">Outflank</a> to test its liveness for 2 months as well.

These assessments, according to Bud, allow customers to answer the critical question: “What is the vendor doing to detect, respond to and resist such attacks?”

There is no certification or standard yet established for this kind of defense. Bud says customers are starting to recognize that they need to be able to answer that question, rather than possess a certain technology.

“Cybersecurity certifications in general don’t look at the particular technology, they look at the business system that assures resilience,” Bud points out. “I think that’s the way it’s going to go.”

Ultimately, he sees biometric liveness as a bedrock for societal trust, so long as it is robust against changing threats. “It needs to be a business system sized and calibrated to the dynamic nature and the scale of the threat.”

He believes no iProov competitor has the kind of one-time biometrics and active threat intelligence it has, but more importantly, that customer need to look beyond the marketing when choosing a vendor for biometric security.

He says the narrative of stopping injection attacks at the source is “pernicious,” and even puts systems at risk of being used for money laundering by sanctioned regimes looking to fund weapons programs.

This kind of threat removes the problem from the domain of confidence, where compliance theatre can suffice, Bud says. He urges stakeholders to “please take the problem seriously.”

		<em>By Simon Horswell, Fraud Specialist, <a href="https://onfido.com/">Onfido</a></em>

In 1995, the world’s first online dating site launched as Match.com, marking a new era for dating. Online dating meant that lonely hearts could connect with potential matches from the comfort of their own home. This convenience leant itself to fast user adoption, and today the dating app market is hugely successful, projected to generate almost <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/eservices/dating-services/online-dating/worldwide">$3.01 billion in revenue in 2023</a>.

But new technology often has risks attached. Who is to say the potential match they’re connecting with is who they say they are? This is not a theoretical concern. Analysis suggests that romance scammers exploit<a href="https://www.tsb.co.uk/news-releases/romance-scammers-break-over-60-hearts-and-wallets-every-week/"> over 60 UK singles weekly</a> to commit financial crimes. In fact, a “<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-wiltshire-65842741">romance fraudster</a>” was recently jailed for five years for defrauding people via online dating platforms. If digital matchmaking platforms lack the means to protect their users from, the loss of trust could threaten their reputation and their future.

Public awareness of identity fraud has risen thanks to the popularity of true crime depictions, such as the Netflix’s <em>Inventing Anna </em>and <em>The Tinder Swindler</em>. In the UK, these shows have increased consumers’ awareness of their digital footprint, with <a href="https://onfido.com/press-release/rise-of-fraud-in-popular-culture-changes-consumer-outlook/">over half (55 percent)</a> saying they are now more cautious online -- but digital dating services cannot afford to rest easy. As fraudsters expand the range of tactics they deploy, the popularization of fraud on our screens may be desensitizing many to the severity of its impact. So much so that almost one-in-five (17 percent) UK consumers are confident they would not fall victim to identity fraud, taking an “it would never happen to me” mentality.

The longevity of digital matchmaking rests upon online platforms keeping their users safe – and this starts with putting identity at the forefront of the experience. As the digital landscape grows in complexity and fraudsters try innovative new ways to scam and scale their operations, trusted apps and services are defined by how they approach security. Those searching for a blueprint can start by re-evaluating their Know Your Customer (KYC) process that establishes user’s identities and assess any associated risk.
<ol>
 	<li>
<h3>A KYC approach to online safety</h3>
</li>
</ol>
Identity verification is at the heart of KYC innovation; it supports businesses to ensure the real identity of new users. With KYC frameworks, companies can accurately check account sign-ups, authenticate users, and check against watchlists for associated risks. However, the online dating industry operates without any form of KYC requirement. Identity verification is often decentralized in the industry, meaning it is left to the discretion of each organization or dating app.

Matchmakers can leverage the benefits of KYC to their competitive advantage, emulating its adoption in other markets such as fintech and gaming. These industries automate KYC checks that allow them to onboard and verify new customers and detect fraud while reducing operational costs.

Unlike fintech and gaming, dating apps are not legally required to perform KYC checks. However, for some, it’s about building trust with users and keeping them safe. Matrimony site, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202202/biometrics-bring-security-for-dating-matrimony-and-betting">Jeevansathi</a>, set an industry precedent in adopting KYC and implementing user identity verification to build a trusted service with a streamlined user onboarding process. Digital-first apps like <a href="https://cherry.codeleap.co.uk/">Cherry</a> have also introduced automated document and biometrics checks to increase safety and speed up user verification.
<ol start="2">
 	<li>
<h3>Mitigating romance scams / Fortified security without adding friction</h3>
</li>
</ol>
The increasing popularity of dating apps opens up new avenues for fraudsters, who often like to hide where there are high volumes. This greater opportunity leads directly to a wider variety of attacks such as impersonation, catfishing, and coercion.

It’s not just dating platforms making changes to address this. Social media giants such as Twitter and Meta’s Facebook have adapted, although some of them learned the hard way. Last year, Twitter set the blueprint of what not to do, when fraudsters seized the opportunity to pay just $8 for Twitter Blue verification and impersonate public figures and global brands, costing companies billions.

In practice, solving this issue requires businesses to monitor a range of ‘signals’ to build trust that a user is legitimate -- like device IP, phone number and information from credit databases. But this business-critical information attracts fraudsters too, who expose it through mass data breaches and then sell it on the dark web. This makes layering identity processes crucial to mitigating risk.

For digital matchmakers, proving a connection between a person’s ID and their physical biometrics helps build trust in users’ real identity. Best practice prescribes that document verification should be deployed as the first line of defense. This can weed out amateur fraudsters, who often leave easily identifiable mistakes. As a second layer, biometric verification can help online businesses mitigate against stolen IDs and deter fraudsters who do not want to put their face to a name. Onfido found that the rate of identity fraud can drop by an average of 3.5x when businesses take this layered approach to identity authentication.
<ol start="3">
 	<li>
<h3>Understanding the biometric advantage</h3>
</li>
</ol>
Digital services nurture trust with their customers by prioritizing security, speed and convenience. These all underpin the modern online experience and can provide a competitive edge, boosting user acquisition and loyalty.

In recent years, biometrics has emerged at the heart of this competitive advantage. Today, as many as <a href="https://onfido.com/press-release/rise-of-fraud-in-popular-culture-changes-consumer-outlook/">43 percent of consumers</a> indicate biometrics is their preferred approach to identity verification. While of those who have previously used a combination of ID checks and biometrics to authenticate themselves, a staggering <a href="https://onfido.com/resources/press-releases/onfido-survey-reveals-businesses-must-establish-trust-online-in-less-than-10-minutes">(91 percent)</a> would do so again. Biometrics offers a visual representation of security, providing reassurance to users not only that businesses have invested in their safety, but that interactions are legitimate and individuals are authenticated.

What’s more, our 2023 Identity Fraud Report revealed that there are <a href="https://onfido.com/landing/identity-fraud-report/">80 percent fewer attacks when faced with a biometric check</a>, as opposed to document verification alone. With fewer fraudsters able to access dating apps and online platforms, these businesses can protect their reputation, grow their user base and provide the peace of mind and confidence that connections are legitimate.
<h2>Placing identity at the heart of matchmaking</h2>
With identity fraud rates still above pre-pandemic levels, digital dating apps must establish new processes to protect their users and verify that individuals are who they say they are. Under the influence of TV documentaries like The Tinder Swindler, consumers have become more aware of the risks, putting the onus on businesses to build trust and brand reputation but protecting users.

That’s why online businesses must take a proactive approach to protect the hearts -- and finances -- of customers. By integrating KYC and taking advantage of automation and biometrics, dating apps can provide a seamless user experience, improve fraud prevention and build trust in digital matchmaking, so users can concentrate on their next connection -- not their next nightmare.

		Global cryptocurrency exchange platform Binance has chosen Japanese know your customer (KYC) and selfie biometrics vendor <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/liquid-inc">Liquid Inc</a> amid rising concern about the effect of AI cyber-attacks on the company’s identity verification.

Binance Japan started onboarding users on its newly launched platform on Monday, two years after the largest global crypto exchange was <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/07/26/binance-to-reenter-japan-in-august-2-years-after-regulators-warning/">warned by local regulators</a> for operating without a license. In order to migrate to Binance Japan, users will have to go through a KYC process with the help of <a href="https://liquidinc.asia/global/">Liquid Inc</a>.

"Liquid eKYC realizes an identity verification process with an extremely low user drop-off rate through its superior facial recognition and ID document image recognition technologies,” CEO of Liquid Hiroki Hasegawa says in an announcement.

Hasegawa added that Liquid has been working in other industries including banks, Web3-related services, telecommunications carriers, second-hand goods markets, the sharing economy, dating applications, and metaverse-related services. The Japanese eKYC vendor recently <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202207/a-buyout-private-investment-and-geo-expansion-for-biometric-kyc-firms">announced</a> its intention to move farther into Southeast Asia.

Binance has reasons for introducing KYC checks other than keeping regulators at bay. Its deal with Liquid comes just a week after CEO and founder of Binance Changpeng Zhao took to X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, to <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1689168481453801472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">raise the alarm</a> about the effects AI attacks could have on identity verification. The founder was commenting on an A<a href="https://twitter.com/joshua_xu_/status/1689019874667024384">I-generated video</a> showing an avatar of HeyGen co-founder and CEO Joshua Xu.

“This is pretty scary from a video verification perspective. Don’t send people coins even if they send you a video,” Zhao wrote.

Binance had <a href="https://www.finder.com/binance-statistics">128 million registered users</a> as of 2022.

The exchange started <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/important-changes-about-binance-identity-verification-51bf294e26324211a4731ca998e110ca">rolling out KYC</a> and anti-money laundering (AML) measures in 2021 to ensure its compliance. One of its partners is U.S.-based <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/jumio">Jumio</a>, which is currently <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202302/judge-keeps-biometric-data-privacy-lawsuit-against-jumio-alive-for-now">battling</a> a biometric data privacy lawsuit in the U.S. state of Illinois for providing biometric checks for the crypto exchange.

		India-based authentication company <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/accura-scan">Accura Scan</a> has passed the Level 2 biometric presentation attack detection (PAD) <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/ibeta">iBeta Quality Assurance</a> test. To celebrate, it is offering all startups some of its products for free.

By passing the assessment, Accura Scan obtained the ISO 30107-03 standard which measures a biometric system's false acceptance rate (FAR) and false rejection rate (FRR) at the point of presentation. The company’s <a href="https://www.ibeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/230712-Accura-Scan-PAD-Level-2-APCER-Confirmation-Letter.pdf">FAR score was 0 percent</a>, making it the only firm in India, Singapore, Asia Pacific and Middle East regions to have reached this level, according to the announcement.

“Obtaining the ISO 30107-03 standard after passing the rigorous iBeta Level 2 test demonstrates the quality and effectiveness of our solutions against spoofing attacks,” the company’s CEO and founder Yasin Patel says in an announcement.

Level 2 PAD tests assess the technology’s effectiveness against sophisticated 3D masks and digital images.

The Mumbai-headquartered startup also says it is giving away its Identity Verification &amp; Digital KYC Suite products for free to startups. More established companies would be offered different modules at a special price of US$5,000 a year.

In July, Accura Scan began offering its <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/accura-scan-offers-partners-free-nfc-scanning-for-biometric-passports-ids">NFC Verification SDK for free</a> to its customers after launching an NFC scanning feature for biometric passports.

During the past years, the company has been working across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202104/accura-scan-brings-biometric-onboarding-solutions-to-middle-east">including clients</a> such as NEC Payments Bahrain, the Gulf Bank of Kuwait and Ahli Bank Qatar. In March, it <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202303/selfie-biometrics-for-kyc-expanding-in-pakistan-thailand-and-colombia">sealed a deal</a> for its 3D selfie biometrics with Danube Properties, one of the largest real estate developers in the United Arab Emirates.

It has registered entities in Singapore, the EU, the UK and the U.S. and is hoping to make headway in these markets next.
