In today's Fix of entertainment news:
Is superhero fatigue a real thing? The answer is yes it is. But you don’t need to take it from me; Nia DaCosta, the director for the upcoming #TheMarvels movie, believes it exists as well. The Marvels, according to the director, will be wacky and silly, with vivid and bright worlds we’ve never seen in an #MCU movie. The Marvel movie will star Ms Marvel, Captain Marvel, and Monica Rambeau, but will that be enough to get Marvel fans out to theaters? We also discuss the upcoming Ashoka Disney Plus series and a Bruce Lee anime series in today’s entertainment fix with Akeem Lawanson!

Years into a benevolent alien occupation of Earth, the human race is still adjusting to the new world order and its quirky coffee table-sized overlords called the Vuvv. Their flashy advanced technology initially held promise for global prosperity, but rendered most human jobs – and steady income – obsolete. When 17-year-old artist Adam Campbell (Asante Blackk) and new girlfriend Chloe Marsh (Kylie Rogers) discover the Vuvv are particularly fascinated with human love and will pay for access to it, they decide to livestream their budding romance to make extra cash for themselves and their families. Life is good, for a while, until the flame of their teenage love fizzles out and they're forced to make very different, absurdly life-altering sacrifices for their families.

When Reggie (Will Ferrell), a naïve, relentlessly optimistic Border Terrier, is abandoned on the mean city streets by his lowlife owner, Doug (Will Forte), Reggie is certain that his beloved owner would never leave him on purpose. But once Reggie falls in with a fast-talking, foul-mouthed Boston Terrier named Bug (Jamie Foxx), a stray who loves his freedom and believes that owners are for suckers, Reggie finally realizes he was in a toxic relationship and begins to see Doug for the heartless sleazeball that he is. Determined to seek revenge, Reggie, Bug and Bug’s pals—Maggie (Isla Fisher), a smart Australian Shepherd who has been sidelined by her owner’s new puppy, and Hunter (Randall Park), an anxious Great Dane who’s stressed out by his work as an emotional support animal—together hatch a plan and embark on an epic adventure to help Reggie find his way home … and make Doug pay by biting off the appendage he loves the most. Strays opens in theaters August 18.

## The Texas Chain Saw Massacre The Game Review

The Texas Chain Saw Massacre reviewed by Travis Northup on PC. Also available on Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5.

"I have little doubt that in a year or two, when they’ve added more scenarios and maps, fixed the most pressing technical issues, and maybe thought up a better way for newcomers to learn how to play, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre will become a staple in my growing asymmetrical horror games library. For now, however, my recommendation comes with a lot of caveats. While the less lopsided take on the asymmetrical horror format definitely works, the shallow number of samey maps can get monotonous pretty quickly, and even with a fair number of playable characters and a solid progression system, I found myself way too comfortable with the three scenarios after just a few hours. Still, the potential behind this format and the reverence for the beloved horror classic it’s based on is clear, even when it does feel a tad half-baked coming out the gates."
