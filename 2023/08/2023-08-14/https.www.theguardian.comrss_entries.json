The situation is now harder in every way \u2013 and trite statements about success and failure won\u2019t comfort school leavers</p><p>It is A-level results week, and I like to spend it scandalising young people with my reminiscing. That probably sunny August morning on which my results arrived, in 1989, I didn\u2019t open the envelope until I had smoked all the cigarettes in the house \u2013 26 in total. It took ages, and by the time I had small capital letters to read, I could barely see. Kids are always so shocked by this, and I can never figure out whether what horrifies them is that an 18-year-old smoked at home, the sheer amount of smoking or the neurotic procrastination.

Grades have changed, university has changed, the jobs market has changed, the concept of work has changed, students have changed, and yet the suite of responses to this moment remains exactly the same. The Telegraph splashes with a pretty blond student looking happy, other papers of note worry about either grade inflation or grade deflation. On social media, the empathy-wing of the teaching profession reminds us that all the kids worked really hard and deserve congratulation, and this hopefully ignites our better selves, so then a load of onlookers do a generic: \u201cCongratulations on your results! If it\u2019s what you hoped for, wonderful.

And the big deal is that it\u2019s no big deal</p><p>The last few weeks have quietly seen a significant and mostly unremarked flowering of on-screen trans visibility, to the extent we might consider cinema is at a tipping point for trans acting. In Barbie, Talk to Me and Red, White and Royal Blue, three films on worldwide release at the same time offer vastly different declensions of trans representation at a time when trans rights are being rolled back around the world. This variety of depictions, from billion-banking blockbusters to breakout hits and cult concerns, has raised few eyebrows from audiences, giving a few clues as to cinema\u2019s ability to provide hope as to public views on trans people.</p><p>That hope is needed. Just last week it was reported that the A24 horror film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/25/talk-to-me-review-horror-michael-danny-philippou-creepy-hand\">Talk to Me</a>, in which a crucial supporting role is taken \u2013 and brilliantly performed \u2013 by transmasculine actor Zoe Terakes, had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/07/kuwait-bans-hit-australian-horror-film-talk-to-me-over-casting-of-trans-actor-zoe-terakes\">banned in Kuwait</a> because of Terakes\u2019 gender identity. In an Instagram post, the actor hit out at the decision, saying: \u201cOur film doesn\u2019t actually ever mention my transness, or my queerness. I am a trans actor who happened to get the role.

Orchestra/Fischer review \u2013 bold, theatrical and enthralling", "description": "<p><strong>Royal Albert Hall, London<br /></strong>The first two Proms of the Hungarians\u2019 mini residency found orchestra, conductor and soloist Andras Schiff moving and thinking as one. The Audience Choice programme might have been eccentric but it was hugely entertaining<strong><br /></strong></p><p>When Iv\u00e1n Fischer and the Budapest Festival Orchestra come to town, expect the unexpected. It\u2019s not just that they eschew auditions, preferring to recruit like-minded musicians with shared views on how classical music must change if it is going to have a future. There is something about <em>how</em> they play, the visceral, physically dynamic way they move as one, that turns a concert into a communal act for orchestra and audience. Clearly word has got around. For the first of three Proms appearances in the orchestra\u2019s 40th year, the Royal Albert Hall was packed to the rafters.</p><p>Given their radical credentials, Saturday evening\u2019s prom was a pretty conservative programme, but there was nothing ordinary about the performances. There is a remarkable weight to the golden, glowing BFO sound, assisted by some canny orchestral geography that places the double basses high up at the back and the timpani even higher. Fischer is a bold, sometimes audacious interpreter, urging his players forward with defined, demonstrative gestures.

Regional leaders don\u2019t accept that, and therein lies hope</p><p>A \u201ccoup belt\u201d now extends across the African continent, running along the Sahel region that bisects north and sub-Saharan Africa. On 10 August, Niger, where the democratically elected president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/12/defiant-leaders-of-niger-coup-confident-of-holding-on-to-power\">was deposed</a> by a military junta, became the last link that completed the corridor of countries run by coupsters. It is the ninth coup or attempted power grab in west and central Africa <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/recent-coups-west-central-africa-2023-07-26/\">since 2020</a>. This might appear at first glance as a retrenchment, the thrusting of African countries back into military rule and weak democratic cultures, with a dash of Russian mischief to complete the picture of a fragile region at the whim of local strongmen and meddling. The reality is much more complicated, and perhaps even oddly hopeful.<br /><br />Let\u2019s first address that which is not entirely true. Much has been made of Russian intervention in the region, primarily through the activities of the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-60947877\">Wagner group</a>. Wagner, in terms of troop deployment, is indeed present in Africa, but only concentrated in <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/what-russias-wagner-group-doing-africa\">a few countries</a>: Central African Republic, Mali and Libya. The rest of Wagner\u2019s active military presence is fluid and inconsistent in loyalty, as mercenary deployment often is: providing support, arms and training to governments and insurgencies alike. The organisation\u2019s main concern appears to be a sort of economic piracy, forging partnerships with local militias and governments to extract and skim off the yield of natural resources: gold in Sudan, oil in Libya, diamonds and uranium in Central African Republic.</p><p>To achieve these ends, Wagner deploys not just firepower and manpower, but nestles within the soft power of the Russian state. <a href=\"https://alleyesonwagner.org/\">All Eyes on Wagner</a>, a project that tracks the outfit\u2019s activities through open source information and witness accounts, told me that Wagner is assisted by the Russian non-profit organisation the Foundation for National Values Protection, which claims to monitor perceptions of government among the citizenry so as to better shape and \u201cget a feel\u201d for what works in certain countries. The result is that Wagner is skilled in the sort of propaganda and targeted local outreach that portrays it as the representative of benign foreign powers, a contrast to the US and ex-colonial European forces. \u201cA gift from Yevgeny Prigozhin\u201d is how food parcels of rice, sugar and lentils distributed to poor people are labelled. Two weeks ago, <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/28/putin-promises-grains-debt-write-off-as-russia-seeks-africa-allies\">Putin proposed</a> to liberate African countries from neocolonialism. In Niger, pro-coup demonstrators assembled waving Russian flags and chanting \u201cdown with France\u201d. This is not to understate Wagner\u2019s and by extension Russia\u2019s influence, but these are enablers, rather than causes, of the spate of coups since 2020. And their presence galvanises US attention and diplomatic scrambling, further establishing the impression that these coups are somehow proxy skirmishes for power on the part of foreign regimes, obscuring the real dynamics on the ground.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/14/niger-crisis-africans-continent-moscow-washington\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/14/niger-crisis-africans-continent-moscow-washington", "date_published": "2023-08-14T05:00:09+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "TV tonight: old friends from Gavin & Stacey take a ride from Billericay to Barry", "description": "<p>Alison Steadman and Larry Lamb reunite for an electrically powered journey.
