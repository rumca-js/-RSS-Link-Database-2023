## Jordan Henderson feels Saudi heat but Mané fails to ruin Al-Ettifaq debut

<p>Former Liverpool captain has moved to Saudi Pro League and was not alone in finding going tough as they beat Al-Nassr</p><p>Jordan Henderson was on his haunches. He had given everything. The former Liverpool captain, and new talisman for Al-Ettifaq, had pushed himself to the physical limits in the service of his team. It was the sort of moment that has previously served to build the Henderson legend, except with a small difference: his team were 1-0 down here and there was still an hour to play.</p><p>An important qualification should probably be made here: it was 34.6C in the stadium at this point and with a level of humidity high enough to hydrate a pack of instant noodles. It was surely, by far, the hottest football match Henderson had ever played in, but one recovery sprint, and a not entirely full-throttle one at that, had entirely done him in. And the England man was hardly alone.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/14/jordan-henderson-feels-saudi-heat-but-mane-fails-to-ruin-al-ettifaq-debut">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Currently ranked No 36 in the world, the Scot believes he can go even higher despite his four-year fight to get back to the top</p><p>Just a few minutes after his devastating five-set second‑round defeat by Stefanos Tsitsipas at Wimbledon this year, Andy Murray was inconsolable as he arrived before the press. Murray had spent the prior months working tirelessly with the belief he had positioned himself for a positive run on home soil. Instead, despite leading by two sets to one overnight, he could not close it out. Asked if he would be back at Wimbledon next year, Murray said he did not know.</p><p>But tennis never stops. One of the fundamental requirements of being a professional tennis player is learning how to swiftly move on from victories and defeats, focusing on the present and looking back only in service of improvement.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/14/andy-murray-im-at-my-highest-ranking-since-the-operation-im-really-proud-of-that">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It was far from deserved but Manchester United and Erik ten Hag started their tricky second album with a win thanks to Raphaël Varane’s header against Wolves. It was not without a late, late scare, though, as André Onana collided with two Wolves players in the penalty area when trying to punch out a cross but the VAR saw nothing untoward.</p><p>The visitors wasted a collection of chances to ensure one goal was enough to collect three points. Wolves leave Old Trafford frustrated but with the hope that their new era does not look as doomed as many feared when Julen Lopetegui left days before the season started, while United will be relieved to get off the mark.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/14/manchester-united-wolves-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Are Gavin and Stacey co-stars Alison Steadman and Larry Lamb even friends? You can’t tell from this mind-bendingly banal failure of a series. Who is responsible for this flop?</p><p>The celebrities are everywhere: go to the ends of the earth and there you will find famous faces wryly immersing themselves in the local culture in the name of yet another TV travelogue (and enjoying a free – no wait, paid – holiday in the process). Stanley Tucci is in Italy, as are Alan Carr and Amanda Holden. Jane McDonald is cruising around the globe. Bradley Walsh, Romesh Ranganathan and Jack Whitehall have made their trips a family affair. Martin Clunes, Conan O’Brien, Fern Britton, Gordon Ramsay, Paul Merton, Zac Efron – I could go on – are all at it, too.</p><p>Granted, few are undertaking quite as humdrum a journey as that of Alison Steadman and Larry Lamb in Alison &amp; Larry: Billericay to Barry. The pair are driving from Essex to south Wales, the twin settings of the beloved 00s sitcom <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/26/gavin-and-stacey-christmas-special-watched-by-116-million-people">Gavin and Stacey</a>, in which they co-starred (not as the culture-clash couple in question, of course, but as Gav’s parents). That is no slight on Britain’s lovely scenery, or the ever-so-friendly people they meet during their increasingly random sightseeing stopoffs: a bird of prey centre, Marlow lock, a puppet-making workshop. Rather, the mundanity of this essentially uneventful trip is magnified by the fact that it has been stretched, wafer-thin, into three hour-long episodes. Worse, squatting at the show’s core is a sad reality: Steadman and Lamb have absolutely nothing to say to each other.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/aug/14/alison-larry-billericay-to-barry-review-the-dullest-celebrity-travel-show-of-all-time">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Some players protested against their manager in 2022 but Jorge Vilda is still there as Spaniards’ interest in team grows</p><p>Jenni Hermoso could already feel the butterflies. There were plenty of tears shed after the win against the Netherlands, and if they can beat Sweden on Tuesday to reach Spain’s first World Cup final then doubtless there will be plenty more. But now, as she put it: “We need to feel that nervous sensation in our stomach. Just thinking about it gives me shivers. It feels so close.”</p><p>As she stepped into the press conference room at Auckland’s Eden Park, the first thing she noticed was the sheer number of journalists and cameras in the room. The semi-final between Spain and Sweden is a 46,000 sell-out, but of course Hermoso can remember the days when, as she put it, “there were five or 10 people asking us questions and 300 people watching the game”. She can sense the magnitude of what they might achieve.

<p>A hit-and-miss documentary often struggles to explain the hows and whys of the Bangladesh Central Bank cyber heist of 2016</p><p>Cybercrime, on top of being difficult to detect and even more so to prove, is notoriously tricky to visualize.

Now we are seeing the power of compassion in team performance.</p><p>Compassion has not been a traditional hallmark of sport. With its UK roots in 19th-century British public schools and universities, modern sport developed as way of creating strong military leaders, training them in the resilience defined in those times by grit and a stiff upper lip. Fear and harsh criticism were essential to toughening up players and soldiers alike. The “tough guy” narrative was dramatised and reinforced by 20th-century media stereotypes and Hollywood’s heroes and became engrained into sport and society.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/14/compassion-better-performance-lionesses-england-sarina-wiegman">Continue reading...</a>

Underneath the sparky rapport shared by the four male leads, however, this play written by Montel Douglas tells a darker story.</p><p>The play was inspired by Douglas’s memories of his cousin being handed a deportation notice at 19. It shows Devonte (Shem Hamilton), who was born in Jamaica but whose life has been spent in the UK, opening a letter informing him that he must find the correct documents to prove his right to stay. All of this burns with the unfairness of the system and Devonte’s cries of “there must be another way” are haunting.</p><p>At <a href="https://underbellyedinburgh.co.uk/event/one-way-out">Underbelly Cowgate, Edinburgh</a>, until 27 August.</p><p><a href="https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/stage/edinburgh-festival-2023">All our Edinburgh festival reviews</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/14/one-way-out-review-underbelly-cowgate-edinburgh">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Readers respond to Kimberly McIntosh’s article about the influencer’s dating doctrine</p><p>Women manipulating men for a more comfortable life (or even just to survive) is as old as patriarchy itself, being born from the disparity between men and women’s relative positions in society (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/09/female-andrew-tate-influencer-dating-debt-man-bills" title="">‘The female Andrew Tate’: the new influencer dating doctrine is extreme – but I can see why it’s popular, 9 August</a>). SheraSeven’s “dating doctrine” is apparently gaining popularity, and both the subject of this article and its writer, Kimberly McIntosh, rightly identify gendered power as relevant context. Men hold more privilege, money, status and agency. Women are perpetually required to adapt to and/or resist this oppression. Here, the focus is on heterosexual relationships. But there is a more sinister undercurrent that McIntosh fails to address.</p><p>I found it jarring that the article said SheraSeven had often been described as “the female Andrew Tate”. Although it said this description was used “half‑jokingly”, this nevertheless gives a dangerously misleading impression that an equivalence between SheraSeven and Tate is in some way possible – it is not. Misandry (and actually I saw none of this in SheraSeven’s views) and misogyny are not some kind of gender-swap equivalents. Violent misogyny is actively expressed in every corner of society every day – women are beaten, murdered and raped with impunity – and this is the context for Tate’s vile fame.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/aug/14/why-sheraseven-is-not-a-female-andrew-tate">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It took 26 cigarettes before I was ready to open that envelope. The situation is now harder in every way – and trite statements about success and failure won’t comfort school leavers</p><p>It is A-level results week, and I like to spend it scandalising young people with my reminiscing. That probably sunny August morning on which my results arrived, in 1989, I didn’t open the envelope until I had smoked all the cigarettes in the house – 26 in total. It took ages, and by the time I had small capital letters to read, I could barely see. Kids are always so shocked by this, and I can never figure out whether what horrifies them is that an 18-year-old smoked at home, the sheer amount of smoking or the neurotic procrastination. I no longer get any uptake from my own kids, who have heard it, but I never fail to get a – I like to think awestruck – “Did you <em>really</em>?”, from their friends, and I always go: “I don’t know why you’re so surprised, I’m vaping right now,” even though I did know they would be surprised, otherwise I wouldn’t have said it.</p><p>The world has changed so much in the however-many decades it is since I took my A-levels. Grades have changed, university has changed, the jobs market has changed, the concept of work has changed, students have changed, and yet the suite of responses to this moment remains exactly the same. The Telegraph splashes with a pretty blond student looking happy, other papers of note worry about either grade inflation or grade deflation. On social media, the empathy-wing of the teaching profession reminds us that all the kids worked really hard and deserve congratulation, and this hopefully ignites our better selves, so then a load of onlookers do a generic: “Congratulations on your results! If it’s what you hoped for, wonderful. If it isn’t, remember that [insert platitude about life] happens to everyone.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/14/i-smoked-neurotically-on-the-day-of-my-a-level-results-but-i-would-be-much-more-nervous-today">Continue reading...</a>

## From Barbie to Talk to Me, trans actors’ visibility is at a tipping point – and about time too | Caspar Salmon

<p>Whether it’s one of the many stars in this summer’s blockbuster, or the bratty bully in Talk to Me, trans stars are showing up on cinema screens. And the big deal is that it’s no big deal</p><p>The last few weeks have quietly seen a significant and mostly unremarked flowering of on-screen trans visibility, to the extent we might consider cinema is at a tipping point for trans acting. In Barbie, Talk to Me and Red, White and Royal Blue, three films on worldwide release at the same time offer vastly different declensions of trans representation at a time when trans rights are being rolled back around the world. This variety of depictions, from billion-banking blockbusters to breakout hits and cult concerns, has raised few eyebrows from audiences, giving a few clues as to cinema’s ability to provide hope as to public views on trans people.</p><p>That hope is needed. Just last week it was reported that the A24 horror film <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/25/talk-to-me-review-horror-michael-danny-philippou-creepy-hand">Talk to Me</a>, in which a crucial supporting role is taken – and brilliantly performed – by transmasculine actor Zoe Terakes, had been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/07/kuwait-bans-hit-australian-horror-film-talk-to-me-over-casting-of-trans-actor-zoe-terakes">banned in Kuwait</a> because of Terakes’ gender identity. In an Instagram post, the actor hit out at the decision, saying: “Our film doesn’t actually ever mention my transness, or my queerness. I am a trans actor who happened to get the role. I’m not a theme. I am a person.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/14/barbie-talk-to-me-trans-actors-visibility">Continue reading...</a>

## Having a baby does mess with your memory. I’m glad I recorded the truth – good and bad – in real time | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett

<p>Most of us quickly forget the reality of early parenthood, but writing it all down was one of the best things I’ve ever done</p><p>“How old was your baby when he started sleeping through?” asked a friend recently. She is in the trenches with her newborn, who will only sleep on her – an affliction that has the potential to push parents to the brink of madness, and for which they have yet to find a cure. I recalled that it was eight weeks, if you count sleeping through as five hours or more, but I didn’t have the heart to tell her. I only remember, I think, because I was well rested enough to make decent memories.</p><p>People, readers included, took great joy in telling me that it wouldn’t last, and they were right: it didn’t. Though because of it, I can scarcely remember the winter at all. The baby was constantly unwell and we had entered the sort of co-sleeping situation that saw neither of us get much rest. For his part, he was waking for milk every hour; and for my part, I couldn’t get a sentence from <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/your-baby-week-by-week-9780091910556">Your Baby Week By Week</a> out of my head. The line was something like: “Imagine how bad you’d feel if your baby died because you co-slept with them.” I can’t remember it word for word now, but at the time it beat its way through the membrane of my troubled slumber to form a haunting refrain that meant any rest I was getting was of even poorer quality and thus, conversely, meant I was probably more likely to have an accident during my waking hours. (I should add here that I have great respect for the book’s author Prof Caroline Fertleman and her co-writer Simone Cave, and say that I met the former when she was briefly my son’s consultant and was genuinely starstruck. Some people turn to putty when they meet pop stars; for others, it’s paediatricians.)</p><p>Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/14/baby-memory-truth-time-early-parenthood-writing">Continue reading...</a>

## Proms 37 & 38: Budapest Festival Orchestra/Fischer review – bold, theatrical and enthralling

<p><strong>Royal Albert Hall, London<br /></strong>The first two Proms of the Hungarians’ mini residency found orchestra, conductor and soloist Andras Schiff moving and thinking as one. The Audience Choice programme might have been eccentric but it was hugely entertaining<strong><br /></strong></p><p>When Iván Fischer and the Budapest Festival Orchestra come to town, expect the unexpected. It’s not just that they eschew auditions, preferring to recruit like-minded musicians with shared views on how classical music must change if it is going to have a future. There is something about <em>how</em> they play, the visceral, physically dynamic way they move as one, that turns a concert into a communal act for orchestra and audience. Clearly word has got around. For the first of three Proms appearances in the orchestra’s 40th year, the Royal Albert Hall was packed to the rafters.</p><p>Given their radical credentials, Saturday evening’s prom was a pretty conservative programme, but there was nothing ordinary about the performances. There is a remarkable weight to the golden, glowing BFO sound, assisted by some canny orchestral geography that places the double basses high up at the back and the timpani even higher. Fischer is a bold, sometimes audacious interpreter, urging his players forward with defined, demonstrative gestures. The results are individual, frequently gripping and often thought-provoking.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/14/proms-37-38-budapest-festival-orchestra-fischer-schiff-review-audience-choice-prom">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Walking robot who looks like a Nazi youth leader turns out – surprise surprise – to have creepy designs on his owner</p><p>As if the future of AI wasn’t already nightmarish enough, along comes this British sci-fi thriller with its storyline about an AI servant becoming dangerously infatuated with his female owner.

Though in the end TIM might be too silly to be scary and yet not sharp enough to work as satire.</p><p>Part of the problem is the AI itself, a humanoid robot inoffensively named TIM (short for “technologically integrated manservant”), played by Eamon Farren. There’s no question of keeping us guessing about his intentions: TIM is sinister from the get-go. With his slicked-down blond hair and penetrating blue-eye stare, he looks like a spoof of a Nazi youth leader with a flash of Hannibal Lecter.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/14/tim-review-sinister-household-gadget-leads-ai-thriller-of-android-infatuation">Continue reading...</a>

Wracked with nerves before each gig, annoyed that the wrong people came to his shows, the Kettering comic had hit a wall. This show is his response. For the first time in Acaster’s standup career, Hecklers Welcome takes us back into his childhood to unearth the roots of his love/hate relationship with performance.

## Lives of Performers review – the wonderful, wonky world of 70s New York avant garde

<p>Yvonne Rainer’s first film is a fascinating immersion in radical art practice in all its meta-narrative incoherence and mess</p><p>Here is the first film from avant garde film-maker Yvonne Rainer, showing as part of a <a href="https://www.ica.art/films/yvonne-rainer">retrospective of her work at the ICA in London</a>, affording viewers a chance to appreciate the wonky, wonderful weirdness that was integral to the New York experimental art scene in the early 1970s. Aptly enough for an artist who started her career in the dance world (having studied with such luminaries as Martha Graham and Merce Cunningham), Rainer grounds this in the world of dance, opening with a rehearsal of a company running through different moves. Don’t be alarmed if no sound is coming through – it’s meant to be that way. Rainer plays throughout with audience expectations and need for narrative closure, offering little titbits of story and then whipping them away from us in juddering ruptures with convention.</p><p>Drill down a bit and it’s not impossible to find a narrative about some kind of love triangle between one man and two women, who may or may not be the performers we see on screen. Over still photographs and snippets of moving theatre, voices are heard reading, with remorselessly flat intonation, a script in which lead dancer Valda (Valda Setterfield) longs for her lover Fernando (Fernando Torm). The plot often doesn’t match up with the action on screen, which is filmed in pencilly black and white 16mm stock by cinematographer Babette Mangolte. (Mangolte would go on to shoot Chantal Akerman’s 1975 classic Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles, recently voted by critics as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/01/chantal-akerman-becomes-first-woman-to-top-bfis-greatest-all-time-films-poll">the greatest film of all time</a>.) Later on, the performers stand frozen in tableaux as the camera rolls, apparently acting out scenes from a dance version of Frank Wedekind’s classic play Lulu.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/14/lives-of-performers-review-yvonne-rainer-new-york-avant-garde">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Half of all weddings at Gretna Green now involve just the couple and two witnesses. But it’s not only elopements. Many more couples are enjoying stealth nuptials</p><p>James and Kathryn drove up to Gretna Green the day before their wedding in 2021, in a clapped-out Seat Leon. On the big day, while Kathryn got her hair done, James went to Gretna football club for a look at the grounds. Their witnesses were a photographer and “some random person who normally works there but had just come in for a cup of tea”. The ceremony, plus the photos, took about 45 minutes, then they went for a pint. Afterwards, they went to Carlisle and “did an escape room – I was still in my wedding dress”, says Kathryn. “The woman thought I was mad.” They finished with one second to spare – they still have the ticket, saying 59:59 – and “had our first marital row”, says Kathryn, about “how to get out of the escape room”.</p><p>Forget the micro-wedding, which is one with fewer than 50 attendees, and consider the micro-micro wedding – just the couple, or maybe a handful of guests. Being allowed to have a row on your big day is just one of what turns out to be a lot of upsides driving the trend. Another advantage that comes up constantly is that you don’t have to engage with the whole wedding industry. “The ridiculous overpricing … it didn’t feel like us,” says Matthew, 35, who married Jo, 30, in May 2022. They had their parents, a sister and an aunt – six guests in all.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/aug/14/micro-micro-wedding-how-big-day-got-smaller-more-intimate-affordable">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘She spoke truth to power, always’: Sinéad O’Connor’s affinity with Black music – and liberation

<p>The Irish musician expressed solidarity and an appreciation for Black music with gospel, rap and roots reggae recordings, which were often fuelled by her own experiences of marginalisation</p><p>On paper, jungle – one of the defining, pioneering sounds of 90s rave music – and the music of Sinéad O’Connor might not be the most obvious pairing. And yet, in 1995, the renowned Irish artist (later called Shuhada’ Sadaqat) requested UK junglist M-Beat <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdBiSt45t3Y">remix her track Fire on Babylon</a> after the pair had met briefly backstage at Top of the Pops the year before. The result was glorious: expansive, shifting beats with her emotive vocal calling out on top.</p><p>For M-Beat, real name Marlon Hart, the reason it worked was simple: “Her music had realness to it,” he says. “The common ground that we shared was that our music was very sincere.” At Top of the Pops, he recalls, “I’m an unknown council estate boy who has been lucky to have some songs chart. And I’m meeting this big star. But she was down to earth, she said she really liked our music.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/14/she-spoke-truth-to-power-always-sinead-oconnors-affinity-with-black-music-and-liberation">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Fascinating material casts light on some of the less familiar stories of those who settled in Britain during and after the second world war, from ‘Casanova’ Poles to Waffen SS</p><p>Even when promoting highly illiberal policies on immigration or asylum seeking, ministers can seldom resist making reference to what Boris Johnson called Britain’s “proud history of welcoming people from overseas, including many fleeing persecution”. The main piece of supporting evidence is always the roughly 80,000 Jews, and particularly around 10,000 children on<em> </em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/06/the-kindertransport-children-80-years-on-we-thought-we-were-going-on-an-adventure">Kindertransport</a><em>, </em>who were saved from Nazi persecution and likely death through finding safety in the UK.</p><p>Though acknowledging that this was a major humanitarian achievement, Paul Dowswell is determined that we do not turn it into a comforting myth we can use as a stick to beat today’s government policy. Then, as now, newspapers led by the <em>Daily Mail </em>(which greeted Hitler’s accession to power with an article that “fizzes with fanboy adoration”) <em>“</em>created a climate of fear and resentment” about refugees, and “governments used bureaucratic barriers and obfuscation to prevent their arrival”.</p><p><em>Aliens: The Chequered History of Britain’s Wartime Refugees</em> by Paul Dowswell is published by Biteback (£25).

<p>Half the profit in former family home, now rented out, would raise enough to buy our home outright but not leave much of a nest egg</p><p><strong>Q</strong> My mother recently died, leaving my sister and me 50% shares in the former family home. The house is currently privately let and we each get 50% of the rent each month. My sister and I get on well. I am recently retired and have paid off my shared-ownership mortgage, and if the family house were sold, half the profit would raise enough capital for my husband and me to staircase to 100% and own our own flat outright but that would not leave much of a nest egg. What’s the best thing to do?<br /><strong>AN</strong></p><p><strong>A</strong> I’m assuming that staircasing to 100% would mean an end to paying rent on the share of your flat that you and your husband don’t currently own. If that’s correct and if what you pay out in rent is more than the rent you receive (after taking income tax into account), selling your mother’s house would seem to be a reasonable option. It would certainly reduce your monthly outgoings, which may be an attractive proposition on a reduced post-retirement income.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/aug/14/should-we-sell-inherited-house-and-staircase-our-shared-ownership-flat-to-100">Continue reading...</a>

<p>All of us will experience pain and stress, but the brain has some smart ways to protect us. Here is how to get prepared for periods of adversity</p><p>Our minds are more resilient than we know. According to a growing body of research, first popularised by psychologists Daniel Gilbert and Tim Wilson in the early 2000s, the brain has a remarkable capacity to make the best of bad events: when we encounter negative situations we subconsciously activate what is known as our psychological immune system.</p><p>A self-protective mechanism analogous to the body’s own immune system, the psychological immune system is a series of processes that our brain initiates to help us make sense of the adverse environment we might be in, assign meaning to what is happening, and ultimately find positives for the future. If we fail to land a job we had wanted, for instance, our brain might reason that the interviewer was rude and biased, therefore it wasn’t the role for us. Or, we will speak to a friend and gain a new perspective on the benefits of our existing job.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/aug/14/the-psychological-immune-system-four-ways-to-bolster-yours-and-have-a-happier-calmer-life">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A Yugoslavian pulp classic from 1967, this tale of a young woman’s erotic misadventures more than matches the French new wave for black humour</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/06/dusan-makavejev-obituary">Dušan Makavejev</a> was the Serbian creator of the incendiary <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/jun/03/derekmalcolmscenturyoffilm.derekmalcolm">1971 movie WR: Mysteries of the Organism</a>, the final word in that title destined forever to be misread as “orgasm”. He was a satirist, political subversive and eroto-evangelist, a performance artist of ex-Yugoslavia’s cinematic Black Wave. Love Affair, or The Case of the Missing Switchboard Operator is an early work from 1967, a brilliant pulp classic which showed that the 1960s could swing behind the iron curtain. I wonder: did anything in the French new wave measure up to this level of nihilist black humour? Godard gave us Breathless; Makavejev gave us an actual breathless corpse.</p><p>It’s about a bored young woman working for a telephone exchange: she wears an audio headset, pushing plugs into sockets and putting people through. She falls in love with an intense young man employed in plumbing and waterworks, but cheats on him with the sleazy postman to the murderous rage of her new boyfriend – and vanishes. The result is something insouciantly explicit and disturbing that defies classification. The action is bisected with digressive lectures on sexology and criminology, with slogans flashed up on screen, clips from Soviet propaganda movies, fourth walls broken. You might call it a forensic crime comedy because the love affair is interspersed with autopsy scenes of the young woman’s corpse: a truly chilling juxtaposition.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/14/love-affair-or-the-case-of-the-missing-switchboard-operator-review-dissident-sex-and-death">Continue reading...</a>

## Catholicism held my family in its sway for decades – but it hid from me a vital truth  | Georgina Lawton

<p>Tonali starts in style, Nketiah shows he should start more and De Bruyne’s fitness is becoming a worry</p><p>Beyond bedding in four debutants at Brentford, a leading task for Ange Postecoglou at Tottenham is to revive a number of players who were all but given up on by Antonio Conte. Richarlison, who scored just one Premier League goal in his first season at the club, has taken on Harry Kane’s role as striker with James Maddison the new playmaker. Few beyond Conte doubt Brazil’s first-choice No 9’s talent but renovation is required. “He’s got a lot of great attributes and he will always work hard for the team and that’s a good starting point for me,” Postecoglou said, while similarly enthusiastic about the midfield performance of Yves Bissouma, signed last year from Brighton and underused by Conte. Davinson Sánchez replaced the concussed Cristian Romero and looked a different player to the befuddled defender targeted by fans last season. The £100m <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/13/german-press-sceptical-harry-kane-100m-transfer">received for Kane</a> will allow reinvestment but Postecoglou inherited talent he is ready to make use of. <strong>John Brewin</strong></p><p>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/13/brentford-tottenham-premier-league-match-report">Brentford 2-2 Tottenham</a></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/13/chelsea-liverpool-premier-league-match-report">Chelsea 1-1 Liverpool</a></em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/aug/14/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Distinguished but disillusioned, TV producer Judith Holder decided to stop work at 60.

Twice nominated for a Bafta, she had executive-produced the comedy series Grumpy Old Women, recorded the voiceover and written the spin-off books. Now the message was: “We’re not going to commission anything for the older woman, Judith, because they are watching anyway.”</p><p>Clearly, this rankled, because Holder, 67, retired – then re-emerged as a<strong> </strong>co-presenter of the podcast <a href="https://www.instagram.com/olderandwiderpodcast/?hl=en" title="">Older &amp; Wider</a>, with the comedian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/jenny-eclair" title="">Jenny Eclair</a>. “The older women we had attracted with Grumpy needed some sort of gang show of their own,” she says. They are more than 200 episodes in, with 5.5m downloads. Last month, Holder made her stage debut in Older &amp; Wider Live. The dates at the Leicester Square theatre in London sold out within 48 hours. It’s “a massive V-sign to a world that assumes that a woman like me is not worth a second glance”, she says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/aug/14/a-new-start-after-60-i-came-out-of-my-shell-when-i-retired-now-im-a-podcast-star-at-67">Continue reading...</a>

In 1975, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/oct/18/gender.uk">Iceland’s women went on strike</a>; inspired by these women, forged in fire and ice and battles with trolls, I too rarely do any housework.

<p>After reading that they are far heavier than you think, I abandoned the housework, the dog – and my grip on reality – and got out the kitchen scales</p><p>Summer makes me go a bit odd. A case in point – I spotted a <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2383998-your-hands-are-probably-about-twice-as-heavy-as-you-think-they-are/">headline</a> recently that read: “Your hands are probably about twice as heavy as you think they are”, and I became instantly obsessed. How heavy are mine, and how could I weigh them? If I estimated their weight, would I mentally factor in this bombshell headline, skewing the result? I mean, have you ever thought about the weight of your hands? Go on: how heavy do you think they are?</p><p>Then I found myself wondering whether heavy hands were bad, like heavy legs are in France. Every pharmacy there will offer you a selection of products at varying prices to deal with what is, I believe, a fictional condition, and if you tell a medical professional that your legs are heavy, they will take this entirely seriously and may even prescribe a trip to walk around in some knee-high seawater, like a racehorse, in a coastal spa somewhere.

## Zo Reken review – Toyota Land Cruiser becomes a safe space in conflict-ridden Haiti

<p>Debates on national identity and foreign aid are par for the course for car riders – though this documentary is itself tangled up in the country’s complex power structures</p><p>‘Zo reken” means “shark bones” in Haitian Creole, and refers to a traditional cane liquor purported to increase virility. It is also a local nickname for the Toyota Land Cruiser, a high-powered car that can breezily weather the tough road conditions in Port-au-Prince. Largely shot in the back of one of these vehicles, Emanuel Licha’s documentary is structured around a steady flow of conversations on national identity, political conflicts and foreign intervention.</p><p>Emerging from these discussions is discontent at the government of Jovenel Moïse – the country’s former president <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/16/haiti-jovenel-moise-assassination-mystery-latest">who was assassinated in 2021</a> – as well as a distrust of international humanitarian aid. One passenger, for example, laments on the irony of how support from NGOs has had the negative effect of increasing Haiti’s dependence on wealthier countries. Once the funding dries up and the medical volunteers depart, existing healthcare infrastructure is left worse for wear. And while the interior of the “zo reken” feels like a safe space for spirited debate, the camera also peeks through the windows to observe the tumultuous reality outside. Traffic stops are crowded with vagrants, and talk of young men being gunned down emerges from the winding streets.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/14/zo-reken-review-haiti">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The very fact of being a Uyghur in China turns everyday life into a political act, as this memoir by renowned poet Tahir Hamut Izgil recounts</p><p>A group of Uyghur friends are having a late-night chat. “I wish the Chinese would just conquer the world,” one says suddenly. “Why do you say that?” another asks, surprised. “The world doesn’t care what happens to us,” the first man replies. “Since we can’t have freedom anyway, let the whole world taste subjugation. Then we would all be the same. We wouldn’t be alone in our suffering.”</p><p>It is an understandable outburst of bitterness. The Uyghurs are a Muslim minority who live mainly in China’s north-western Xinjiang region. They have long faced discrimination and persecution. Since 2016, the repression <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/16/world/asia/china-xinjiang-documents.html">has greatly intensified</a>, with mass detention, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-53220713">forced sterilisation</a> and abortion, the separation of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f0d3223a-7f4d-11e8-bc55-50daf11b720d">thousands of children</a> from their parents, and the razing of <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/04/12/surviving-the-crackdown-in-xinjiang">thousands of mosques</a>.

## A key lesson from the Niger crisis: Africans, not global powers, will plot the continent’s path

<p>The assumption is that Moscow and Washington will dictate events. Regional leaders don’t accept that, and therein lies hope</p><p>A “coup belt” now extends across the African continent, running along the Sahel region that bisects north and sub-Saharan Africa. On 10 August, Niger, where the democratically elected president <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/12/defiant-leaders-of-niger-coup-confident-of-holding-on-to-power">was deposed</a> by a military junta, became the last link that completed the corridor of countries run by coupsters. It is the ninth coup or attempted power grab in west and central Africa <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/recent-coups-west-central-africa-2023-07-26/">since 2020</a>. This might appear at first glance as a retrenchment, the thrusting of African countries back into military rule and weak democratic cultures, with a dash of Russian mischief to complete the picture of a fragile region at the whim of local strongmen and meddling. The reality is much more complicated, and perhaps even oddly hopeful.<br /><br />Let’s first address that which is not entirely true. Much has been made of Russian intervention in the region, primarily through the activities of the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-60947877">Wagner group</a>. Wagner, in terms of troop deployment, is indeed present in Africa, but only concentrated in <a href="https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/what-russias-wagner-group-doing-africa">a few countries</a>: Central African Republic, Mali and Libya. The rest of Wagner’s active military presence is fluid and inconsistent in loyalty, as mercenary deployment often is: providing support, arms and training to governments and insurgencies alike. The organisation’s main concern appears to be a sort of economic piracy, forging partnerships with local militias and governments to extract and skim off the yield of natural resources: gold in Sudan, oil in Libya, diamonds and uranium in Central African Republic.</p><p>To achieve these ends, Wagner deploys not just firepower and manpower, but nestles within the soft power of the Russian state. <a href="https://alleyesonwagner.org/">All Eyes on Wagner</a>, a project that tracks the outfit’s activities through open source information and witness accounts, told me that Wagner is assisted by the Russian non-profit organisation the Foundation for National Values Protection, which claims to monitor perceptions of government among the citizenry so as to better shape and “get a feel” for what works in certain countries. The result is that Wagner is skilled in the sort of propaganda and targeted local outreach that portrays it as the representative of benign foreign powers, a contrast to the US and ex-colonial European forces. “A gift from Yevgeny Prigozhin” is how food parcels of rice, sugar and lentils distributed to poor people are labelled. Two weeks ago, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/28/putin-promises-grains-debt-write-off-as-russia-seeks-africa-allies">Putin proposed</a> to liberate African countries from neocolonialism. In Niger, pro-coup demonstrators assembled waving Russian flags and chanting “down with France”. This is not to understate Wagner’s and by extension Russia’s influence, but these are enablers, rather than causes, of the spate of coups since 2020. And their presence galvanises US attention and diplomatic scrambling, further establishing the impression that these coups are somehow proxy skirmishes for power on the part of foreign regimes, obscuring the real dynamics on the ground.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/14/niger-crisis-africans-continent-moscow-washington">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When Lizzo’s dancers accused her of misdeeds in an Amsterdam strip club, it caused outrage. So is the kind of on-tour debauchery made famous by bands like Led Zeppelin now passé?</p><p>For years, a concert tour was seen as the ultimate expression of the “rock’n’roll lifestyle”: a months-long bacchanal during which bands would sniff and swig their way across a continent, often leaving a trail of wreckage behind them. Oasis famously once split up on the road after Noel Gallagher went awol, the rest of the band having been supposedly supplied crystal meth by the Brian Jonestown Massacre; Led Zeppelin rampaged through groupies and hotel rooms on their infamous world tours, while <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/may/10/madonna-truth-or-dare-at-30-the-most-revealing-pop-star-documentary-ever">In Bed With Madonna</a>, the star’s wild 1991 tour documentary, culminates with a game of truth or dare in which she fellates a bottle and goads a dancer to show his penis.</p><p>In recent years – as conversations around substance abuse, consent and mental health have forced those in the music industry to consider the damaging nature of a lot of accepted rock tradition – that kind of touring-life debauchery has supposedly gone further and further out of fashion, replaced by a safer, more enlightened music culture. Which made it all the more shocking when, this month, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/01/lizzo-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-weight-shaming-former-dancers">Lizzo was sued by former dancers who alleged that</a>, among other toxic workplace practices, the American singer encouraged them to dance with and touch naked strippers at a club while on tour in Amsterdam. (Lizzo denies all the accusations.) So has the culture really changed? Or has an ever-PR-driven industry just found better ways to hide all the shagging, drinking and drug-taking that still goes on behind the scenes?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/14/its-just-not-worth-it-is-this-the-end-of-sex-drugs-and-rocknroll">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Home minister promises widespread reforms but some experts suggest the new laws are more a repackaging of existing measures than real change</p><p>More than 160 years after Lord Macaulay laid down a penal code for what was then a colony of the British crown, India is poised to supplant it with new laws free of colonial vestiges and designed to speed up the judicial process.</p><p>The government has introduced three bills in parliament that it says will provide a special focus on crimes against women and address the intolerable delays in the system which can leave people waiting 15-30 years for a verdict.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/14/india-laws-protecting-women-review-penal-code">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In 1940 the German army took over the Channel Islands and built concentration camps on Alderney where hundreds, possibly thousands, of people died.
