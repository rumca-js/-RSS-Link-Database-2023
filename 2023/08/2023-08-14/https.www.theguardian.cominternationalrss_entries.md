Road racing cyclist nicknamed the ‘Eagle of Toledo’ who was the first Spaniard to win the Tour de France<p>Federico Bahamontes, who has died aged 95, was the first Spaniard to win the Tour de France. Eccentric, driven and solitary, the “Eagle of Toledo” was widely regarded as the tour’s finest mountain climber of the postwar era, taking the King of the Mountains prize six times between 1954 and 1964, a record that was not equalled until the 1980s. He was also the first to win the Mountains prize in all three grand tours – France, Spain and Italy.</p><p>Bahamontes is celebrated for an episode on the Col de Romeyère in the Alps in his first tour in 1954: he was part of a four-rider break that led up the climb, with – so he recalled – 14 minutes’ advantage on the bunch, crossed the King of the Mountains line first, then pulled in and went straight to an ice-cream van; he was mobbed by the crowd as he tackled the cone.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/14/federico-bahamontes-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Three years ago, two brides and a ‘detective’ friend released a true-crime series in which they visited zoos, tracked submarines and interrogated guests. Now, it’s a word-of-mouth smash</p><p>“If someone asked me about my wedding, the first thing that would come to my mind would be the bathroom,” says Karen Whitehouse. It is not the answer most people would give, but most people haven’t had the misfortune to find poop on the floor of the women’s loo at their wedding reception. And, from the small number who have, even fewer have made a hit podcast about it.</p><p>Who Shat on the Floor at My Wedding? is a 13-part “poodunnit” from Whitehouse, her wife, Helen McLaughlin, and their friend Lauren Kilby, in which they grill friends and family in an attempt to find out who was responsible. First released in 2020, it has recently raced to the top of the Apple podcast charts in the UK – thanks to the website still known as Twitter at the time of writing. The social media network’s users boosted listeners from the hundreds of thousands to the millions.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/aug/14/we-became-weirdly-obsessed-how-a-poodunnit-podcast-about-a-weddings-dirty-secret-went-viral">Continue reading...</a>

## Even in Greek towns razed by wildfires, people don’t blame the climate crisis. That must change | Christy Lefteri

<p>Many see climate breakdown as a problem of the future, but it’s here now. To move forward, we must understand our part in it</p><p>During the summer of 2021, I flew to Greece to learn more about the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/30/its-like-a-war-greece-battles-increase-in-summer-wildfires">wildfires</a> there. I wanted to hear people’s stories, to understand what it meant to be displaced by environmental disaster. I have family in Greece and Cyprus and the approach of each summer causes a lot of anxiety. That year, fires were raging in Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Croatia and Cyprus, and I was three months pregnant. Feeling Evie growing inside me made me wonder what kind of world she would live in – and made me all the more determined to learn as much as I could about what people had experienced.</p><p>I spent a lot of time in Mati, a small town on the east coast of Greece, less than 20 miles from Athens. There, I talked to local people, and their experiences profoundly moved me. In a cafe that had survived the fire, a hub of safety and community for survivors, I met brave children who now have to live with terrible scars, physical and emotional. I met a man who could not even speak to me, his eyes filling with tears, and he told me that he had no words in a way that has stayed with me ever since.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/14/greece-wildfires-climate-crisis-future">Continue reading...</a>
