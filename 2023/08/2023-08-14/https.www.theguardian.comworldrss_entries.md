We’re actually progressing a bit better than we thought six or 12 months ago when it comes to wages growth in our economy.</p><p>And we’re doing that at the same time as inflation is moderating the economy, and that’s because the source of inflation in our economy isn’t that people particularly on low pay earning too much, inflation is coming at us from all kinds of other directions. And so getting wages moving again is part of the solution to these cost of living pressures, not part of the problem.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/aug/15/australia-news-live-peter-dutton-anthony-albanese-matildas-world-cup-football-labor-rental-crisis-housing-cost-of-living">Continue reading...</a>

Covid has become a polarising topic that many people just want to forget about. Earlier this year, the World Health Organization officially declared the pandemic over. Cases, hospitalisations and deaths are at their lowest levels, though infections have undoubtedly become more difficult to track as monitoring systems are dismantled. But even so, experts have made it clear that Covid will be with us for many years to come even though the acute phase of the health emergency is over.</p><p>Like an unwelcome guest that does not know when the party is over, Covid has continued to mutate and shape shift, creating a viral, ever expanding family tree through its numerous variants and sub-variants, with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/09/who-declares-eris-covid-strain-a-variant-of-interest-as-uk-cases-rise">Eris the latest of interest</a> to the WHO.
