Thank you for joining us as we journey through the great book of Exodus. And thank you very much to the DailyWire+ crew for having the vision and generosity of spirit to make this Exodus seminar freely available to all who are interested. Perhaps you might consider a Daily Wire+ subscription; it's a bastion of free speech. We have great content there with much more to come. Click here to learn more: https://bit.ly/3Q0lXj7 

What do Pharaoh and Stalin have in common? Jordan and the roundtable discuss chapters nine through twelve in Exodus, finding parallels between the tyranny inherent in political leadership during Mosesâ€™ time and now, the repercussions of putting the state above the church regarding COVID-19 lockdowns, and the notion that for the will to be as free as it can be, it has to span the spectrum of choice between radical evil and radical good.

Episode One will be available on YouTube indefinitely, serving as the gateway to this enlightening exploration. Episodes 2 through 17 will be available for a limited time, so be sure to watch as they release each Monday.
