On August 10, the upper reaches of the Qing River in northern China's Hebei Province had a dam break its banks, while flood levels in downstream Tianjin were dropping. Does this mean that the authorities are discharging flood water to Hebei in order to protect Tianjin?
...
In order to ensure that the flood water doesn't flow out and affect what they consider to be more important cities, these officials led police teams and personally directed them to block the flood water exits. Yes, to make sure the water stays in the farmland. 
Of course, the villagers are not stupid, only that no one knows whether they have the ability to protect their homes and lands.
