<p>Buying an HDMI cable should be simple&mdash;but some cables don&rsquo;t perform as expected, while others don&rsquo;t clearly indicate the HDMI specifications supported.</p>



<p>If you don&rsquo;t have time to dig into the details yourself, use this guide to grab the right cable for your needs. We&rsquo;ve sorted it by HDMI specification (also known as HDMI version), so you can find an instant, affordable match. Our picks also sidestep the problems you might encounter when hunting on your own, be it cheaply made cables that perform poorly or overpriced ones that do nothing better than less expensive alternatives.</p>

<p>Need a cable to use with a high-refresh monitor, especially one above 144Hz? We generally recommend using a DisplayPort cable instead of HDMI&mdash;look for one rated for DisplayPort 1.3 or higher. Or grab one of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3613834/where-should-you-buy-monitor-cables-ask-an-expert.html">our suggestions for DisplayPort 1.4 cables</a>, which are backward compatible. To learn more about how these two interfaces compare, see our complete rundown of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/457147/hdmi-vs-displayport-which-display-interface-reigns-supreme.html">HDMI vs. DisplayPort</a>. </p>

<p>Rolling with a setup that can handle 4K/144Hz, 5K/60Hz, or 8K/30Hz? Or dynamic HDR? We favor Monoprice&rsquo;s certified Ultra High-Speed cable to handle those hefty bandwidth requirements. You&rsquo;ll pay $14 for a 6-foot cable, and a&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=42682&amp;xcust=2-1-394589-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">braided cable variant</a> costs just a little more.</p>



<p>You can spend less on non-certified Ultra High-Speed HDMI cables, but we don&rsquo;t recommend it, especially given the amount of data you&rsquo;ll likely pass over it. (Ultra High Speed cables have a bandwidth of 48Gbps.) Compared to other established companies like Belkin, Monoprice offers the best mix of affordability and reliability.</p>

<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/12/hdmi-2985919_1920-100783896-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="hdmi 2985919 1920" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/12/hdmi-2985919_1920-100783896-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">
<p>You can buy an HDMI cable rated for a higher spec than you need&mdash;HDMI cables are backward compatible.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p>HDMI cables are backward compatible, so you can always buy the highest-specification cable available and call it a day. Even if it exceeds what your devices can support, it could come in handy when upgrading to newer tech.</p>



<p>You don&rsquo;t have to, of course. (Our sister site TechHive explains why in this article addressing the common question of &ldquo;<a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/3330376/do-i-need-a-4k-hdmi-cable.html">Do you need a 4K HDMI cable?</a>&rdquo;) You can save a little cash by skipping future-proofing.</p>



<p>To figure out the minimum HDMI specification you need for your setup, look up the spec supported by your output device (PC, streaming device, gaming console, etc) and your display (monitor, TV). You may see these listed under &ldquo;HDMI version&rdquo; in the product information.</p>



<p>If the two match, simply buy an HDMI cable rated for that specification. If they don&rsquo;t match, you can buy a cable that&rsquo;s rated for the lower (older) spec, since your final output will be limited by the device with the lower HDMI version.</p>



<p>Example: Your monitor is rated for HDMI 1.4b, but your graphics card can support HDMI 2.0. You&rsquo;ll only ever get the maximum resolution and frame rates of HDMI 1.4b, which are 1080p/144fps and 1440p/75Hz, plus up to 4K/60fps depending on the level of color data compression.</p>



<p>You can buy a cable that matches the higher specification, but it&rsquo;s not necessary. When you replace the lower-HDMI-version device with a brand-new piece of gear, you&rsquo;ll usually get a compatible HDMI cable in the box.</p>

<p>Dell&rsquo;s U3223QE is a premium monitor with 4K resolution and gobs of connectivity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The U3223QE has a cutting-edge IPS Black panel that roughly doubles the contrast when compared to other 32-inch IPS monitors. It provides a richer experience with a better sense of depth that&rsquo;s especially noticeable when viewing in a dark room. The monitor also excels in color performance, brightness, and sharpness.</p>

<p>Connectivity is a highlight. This monitor offers USB-C with up to 90 watts of Power Delivery for charging a connected laptop or tablet. The USB-C port can drive a hub with a total of five additional USB-A ports, ethernet, and even DisplayPort-out (meaning you can daisy-chain video to a second monitor).</p>

<p>This monitor has a smaller sibling, the <a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=14154&amp;GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Dell-UltraSharp-U2723QE-27-16/dp/B09TQZP9CL?ascsubtag=2-2-811315-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">Dell U2723QE</a>, which is less expensive. We did not receive it for testing but expect it to perform similarly, as it uses the same IPS Black panel technology.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Need a monitor that works well at an extremely low price? The Acer K242HYL is our go-to pick.</p>

<p>The Acer K242HYL&rsquo;s specifications are good for a budget display. It has a 24-inch screen with 1080p resolution and a maximum refresh rate of 75Hz. Adaptive sync is supported, so the monitor will function with AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync. Video inputs include HDMI and VGA. Build quality is good thanks to robust plastic panels that feel thick and durable when handled.</p>

<p>This monitor has a bright image with reasonable contrast. Color performance stands out, as the monitor can cover most of the sRGB color gamut and has extremely good color accuracy overall. Photos, videos, and games look close to what their creator intended.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The K242HYL lacks a height-adjustable stand but offers a VESA mount that is compatible with most third-party monitor stands and arms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That aside, the K242HYL is an outstanding budget monitor suited for everyday use, casual gaming, and amateur content creation. This is all the monitor most people will ever need.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dell&rsquo;s G2724D hits the sweet spot for gamers on a budget who also care deeply about quality.</p>

<p>The 27-inch IPS LCD panel features 1440p resolution and a refresh rate of 165Hz. The color gamut spans 100 percent of sRGB, 86 percent of DCI-P3, and 82 percent of Adobe RGB, ensuring a bright and vibrant image that&rsquo;s not only excellent in games but serviceable for most content creation. But its standout feature is the Adaptive Sync support, with official support for VESA Adaptive Sync, AMD FreeSync Premium, and Nvidia G-Sync.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite its affordable price, the monitor doesn&rsquo;t skimp on design, with a handsome matte black and gray chassis and sporty rear vents that provide an aggressive yet unobtrusive look. It also comes with a functional monitor stand that offers a range of ergonomic adjustments and a compact base that doesn&rsquo;t take up unnecessary desktop space.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The monitor doesn&rsquo;t offer USB connectivity or 3.5mm audio-out. Also, the HDR performance is a bit lackluster, so those who require HDR gaming may want to look at other options.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s hard to beat the G2724D&rsquo;s performance at $300 or below and, more importantly, it offers everything an average PC gamer is going to need for smooth and responsive gaming. All told, it offers excellent value, and could have a place on your desk for five to 10 years.</p>

<p>The Viewsonic VP16-OLED is an impressive portable OLED monitor that combines class-leading image quality with a unique and useful stand.</p>

<p>As its name suggests, the VP16-OLED has a 15.6-inch OLED panel with 1080p resolution. It delivers outstanding image quality, scoring top marks in color accuracy, gamut, and contrast. The VP16-OLED&rsquo;s performance is superior to many full-sized OLED monitors&mdash;and completely smashes portable competitors. This makes the VP16-OLED ideal for photographers, videographers, and other content creators.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The monitor has a versatile stand. It can be used as a kickstand, as is true of most portable monitors, or expand to hold the monitor upright. The stand includes two USB-C ports, either of which can be used to provide power and video input to the monitor. It also offers a micro-HDMI port for use with devices that lack USB-C. Viewsonic bundles the monitor with several cable types and a USB-C power brick, so you don&rsquo;t have to buy additional adapter cables or accessories.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s just one problem: It&rsquo;s expensive. The Viewsonic VP16-OLED retails at $399.99, more than double the price of a basic 1080p portable monitor. That&rsquo;s tough to justify if you just need a second monitor to display Slack and Twitter, but it&rsquo;s a worthwhile upgrade if you care about image quality.</p>

<p>The Asus ProArt PA279CRV is an impressive 4K monitor that delivers high-end features without breaking the bank.</p>

<p>Its 27-inch 4K display offers stunning sharpness and clarity, making it a joy for both home office use, entertainment, and content creations. Its pixel density of 163 pixels per inch is near the highest available on a modern monitor and particularly well suited to handling high-resolution photos and 4K video. The expansive color gamut, which covers 100 percent of sRGB, 99 percent of DCI-P3, and 98 percent of AdobeRGB, rivals many pricier models and provides vivid, accurate color.</p>

<p>Asus also delivers on connectivity. The monitor has a USB-C port with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and 96 watts Power Delivery, two DisplayPort 1.4 ports (with one supporting Daisy Chain), two HDMI 2.0 ports, three USB-A 3.2 Gen-1 ports, and a 3.5mm audio-out. The monitor&rsquo;s wide range of video inputs makes it a great choice for those who use multiple computers.</p>

<p>The PA279CRV&rsquo;s contrast ratio leaves a bit to be desired, and its 60Hz refresh rate may disappoint in fast-paced games, but these drawbacks are overshadowed by its approachable $469 MSRP. Most competitors that match its image quality are at least several hundred dollars more expensive, while less expensive 4K alternatives have woefully limited connectivity and far less impressive color performance.</p>

<p>Alienware&rsquo;s AW3423DWF is an outstanding PC gaming monitor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This monitor has a QD-OLED panel, which is like that used in top-tier OLED televisions. OLED provides a nearly infinite contrast ratio, excellent color performance, and respectable brightness. The result is a punchy, vibrant image with an unparalleled sense of dimensionality. The monitor&rsquo;s ultrawide aspect ratio only heightens the sense of immersion.</p>

<p>Motion clarity is superb. The monitor has a refresh up to 165Hz and supports both AMD FreeSync Premium Pro and VESA Adaptive Sync. The OLED panel technology it uses has lower pixel response times than competitors, too, so there&rsquo;s minimal added blur and ghosting in motion. Motion is as crisp as you&rsquo;ll find below 240Hz.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Alienware AW3423DWF is an alternative to the AW3423DW, a slightly older and nearly identical monitor. The AW3423DW has a higher fresh rate of 175Hz and supports Nvidia G-Sync Ultimate. It&rsquo;s also $100 to $200 more expensive. Though we recommend the AW3423DWF for most people, the AW3423DW is better for owners of high-end Nvidia graphics cards.</p>

<p>The AW3423DWF is expensive at $1,099.99, but its performance justifies the price. Competing 34-inch and 38-inch ultrawides without QD-OLED technology are often just as expensive but have less impressive image quality.</p>

<p>Asus&rsquo; ProArt PA348CGV is an ultrawide that targets professionals but throws in features to please gamers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Professionals will love the PA348CGV for its excellent color accuracy, wide color gamut, and healthy range of image quality adjustments. The monitor looks outstanding at default settings and can be tuned to fit a variety of color gamuts or meet specific color temperature and gamma targets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Monitors like this normally leave gamers in the cold, but the PA348CGV is an exception. It has a maximum refresh rate of 120Hz and supports AMD FreeSync Premium Pro. Its motion clarity can&rsquo;t rival the best 144Hz or 165Hz ultrawide gaming monitors, but it&rsquo;s a huge boost over a 60Hz panel.</p>

<p>The PA348CGV is built like a tank with sturdy plastics and a weighty stand that keeps the ultrawide panel planted. It also has good connectivity with a total of four video inputs, one of which is USB-C. The USB-C port drives a hub with four additional USB-A ports.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And here&rsquo;s the real surprise: the PA348CGV&rsquo;s MSRP is just $729. That&rsquo;s not cheap, but it&rsquo;s close to the price of alternative professional monitors that completely lack an enhanced refresh rate or adaptive sync. That makes the PA348CGV an easy choice for ultrawide enthusiasts.</p>

<p>Do you want motion clarity? Alienware&rsquo;s AW2524H, the world&rsquo;s first 500Hz gaming monitor, is for you.</p>

<p>Fast objects look detailed and quick camera pans across an in-game map remain legible. Competitive gamers will also love its lightning-fast input latency with support for Nvidia Reflex Analyzer, which helps players see precisely how fast their PC responds to input. Just be warned: this performance comes at a premium price of $829.99 MSRP, and the benefits can only be fully realized in games that can reach 500 frames per second.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an attractive monitor, too, with Alienware&rsquo;s sleek, futuristic design and excellent build quality. The compact stand allows for ergonomic adjustment but doesn&rsquo;t consume excessive desk space.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The AW2524H&rsquo;s image quality is not competitive with similarly priced monitors, but it&rsquo;s not bad, either. It offers strong SDR image quality with decent brightness, good contrast ratio, and vivid color. However, the HDR image quality is underwhelming, and the monitor lacks some connectivity options, such as USB-C input.</p>

<p>Alienware&rsquo;s super-fast 500Hz monitor isn&rsquo;t for everyone, but competitive gamers shouldn&rsquo;t think twice. The monitor&rsquo;s motion clarity is unbeatable.</p>

<p>Do you need a monitor with exceptional color accuracy, contrast, and sharpness? The Asus ProArt Display OLED PA32DC delivers. It&rsquo;s an impressive monitor that, in several respects, is the best we&rsquo;ve ever reviewed.</p>

<p>The monitor&rsquo;s key trait is its high-quality OLED display panel. It has excellent contrast, color accuracy, and a wide color gamut, all of which add up to a realistic and dramatic image. The monitor also has 4K resolution and a conventional RGB subpixel layout, which avoids the color fringing issues that are found in QD-OLED monitors like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/624305/alienware-aw3423dw-review-quantum-dot-oled-makes-rival-monitors-feel-obsolete.html">Alienware AW3423DW</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Image quality is superb out of the box, but experienced owners can go a step further. The PA32DC has numerous image quality options in its on-screen menu system and includes a built-in calibration utility for ultra-accurate results. Professionals can use these options to achieve the exact results their work requires.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a wonderfully robust monitor with chunky bezels, big menu buttons, and a sturdy chassis that includes a built-in handle. Asus supplies both a VESA stand for desktop use and flip-out legs for quick setup at a mobile studio or job site. The monitor has extensive connectivity including five video inputs.</p>

<p>The only downside? It&rsquo;s expensive with a retail price of $3,000. Even that, however, is not so bad: Similar OLED and Mini-LED monitors, like the Apple Pro Display XDR and LG UltraFine 32EP950, are often even more expensive.</p>

<p>This 48-inch OLED monitor delivers 4K resolution and a refresh rate up to 138Hz. It offers an outstanding picture straight out of the box with spot-on color accuracy, excellent contrast, and a wide color gamut. It also has excellent viewing angles and, of course, a large display area that&rsquo;s ideal for a large office or small home entertainment center. The monitor&rsquo;s maximum brightness could be higher, but it still looks good in HDR content, especially when used in a dark room.</p>

<p>Though similar in size to some OLED televisions, the Acer Predator CG48 is not a TV. It doesn&rsquo;t have a TV tuner and can&rsquo;t connect to a coaxial antenna or cable connection. PC connectivity is superb, though, with DisplayPort, USB-C, and HDMI 2.1 available, as well as three additional HDMI 2.0 ports.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A remote is included and can be used to navigate the monitor&rsquo;s on-screen menu. Acer provides a wide range of image quality adjustments that make it easy to customize the image to your liking. The monitor&rsquo;s out-of-box performance was excellent, too, and worked well with both PC and game console inputs.</p>

<p>The Acer Predator CG48 carries a MSRP of $1,499.99, which is high. It&rsquo;s often on sale, so it&rsquo;s wise to shop around. Buying the monitor at a discount can save you hundreds.</p>

<p>Want a monitor that can (literally) flex on your friend&rsquo;s puny 34-inch ultrawide? The Corsair Xeneon Flex 45WQHD240 is for you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Xeneon Flex has a flexible OLED panel that can be positioned so that the display is entirely flat or curved up to a radius of 800R (among the most aggressive curves you&rsquo;ll find on any monitor). A pair of handles on the right and left flank are used to flex the display. They feel a tad awkward but get the job done.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a massive display with a 45-inch ultrawide panel and a 21:9 aspect ratio. It&rsquo;s much, much larger than a 34-inch ultrawide (roughly 10 inches wider and 5 inches taller), which provides an extremely immersive experience and tons of room for multi-tasking apps. It&rsquo;s also taller than a 49-inch super-ultrawide like the Samsung Odyssey Neo G9, though (of course) not quite as wide.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Image quality is excellent with an extremely high contrast ratio and wide color gamut. The 240Hz refresh rate provides superb motion clarity, too. Even HDR performs reasonably well, as the panel&rsquo;s brightness is relatively high (for OLED, at least). The monitor&rsquo;s 3440&times;1440 resolution doesn&rsquo;t look sharp spread across the 45-inch panel, but this only feels noticeable on the Windows desktop. Games and streaming content look incredible.</p>

<p>The Corsair Xeneon Flex is built like a tank and has a massive, stable stand with built-in ports including USB-C. Unfortunately, the stand doesn&rsquo;t adjust for height. It&rsquo;s also an expensive monitor at a retail MSRP of nearly $2,000. That&rsquo;s a lot of cash, but the Xeneon Flex&rsquo;s versatile OLED panel and top-tier image quality justify the price.</p>

<p>Okay, folks. Hold onto your butts, because we&rsquo;re about to take a trip out to the cutting-edge of PC monitors: the Asus ROG Swift PG32UQX.</p>

<p>This monitor has a Mini-LED backlight with 1,152 zones that can adjust brightness independently. As a result, it can ramp up brightness to extremely high levels when required, or turn off zones entirely in dark scenes. This results in an excellent contrast ratio and superb brightness.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These traits make the PG32UQX a standout in HDR games and movies. Bright, high-contrast scenes look amazing. You can almost feel the heat of an explosion and the intense glare of sun reflecting off a window or mirror.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s more to the monitor than HDR, however. It scores extremely well in overall contrast, has class-leading color performance, and provides a crisp 4K image. The monitor supports G-Sync Ultimate for smooth gameplay with Nvidia hardware and has a maximum refresh rate of 144Hz.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only problem? Price. This monitor sells for around $3,000. Shoppers may want to consider the slightly less exorbitant <a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=14154&amp;GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/ViewSonic-XG321UG/dp/B094RG7GYR?ascsubtag=2-2-811315-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">Viewsonic Elite XG321UG</a> as an alternative. It has a similar Mini-LED backlight.</p>

<p>The AOC Agon Pro AG274QZM is a 27-inch gaming monitor with Mini-LED backlight technology. It has a native resolution of 2560&times;1440 and a refresh rate of 240Hz, plus official support for Nvidia G-Sync (AMD FreeSync worked in our testing but isn&rsquo;t officially supported).&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also VESA DisplayHDR 1000 certified&mdash;which is why it&rsquo;s on this list. The AG274QZM is not the best HDR monitor available, but it&rsquo;s close, and its retail price of $899.99 undercuts most competitors. This monitor can reach an incredible peak brightness of 948 nits and pairs that with a solid contrast ratio and excellent color performance. If it were any brighter, you&rsquo;d need to wear sunscreen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>AOC&rsquo;s design is aggressive with red chrome accents and RGB lighting, but the build quality is not as nice as monitors from Alienware or the Asus Republic of Gamers line. The monitor ships with a sturdy stand that has typical ergonomic adjustments such as height, tilt, swivel, and pivot (rotate) for use in landscape orientation. A 100x100mm VESA mount is available for use with third-party monitor stands and arms.</p>

<p>Connectivity is solid, too. The monitor has two HDMI 2.1 ports and one DisplayPort 1.4, plus one USB-C 3.2 port with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and 65 watts Power Delivery. The USB-C port connects with four USB-A downstream ports.</p>

<p>Still, it all comes down to HDR. The AOC Agon Pro AG274QZM is among the least expensive Mini-LED monitors available today and the best way to experience HDR on your PC for less than $1,000.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-to-look-for-in-a-monitor">What to look for in a monitor</h2>



<p>There are literally hundreds&mdash;and perhaps thousands&mdash;of monitors to choose from. Choosing one from the crowd can be difficult, but knowing the key traits of a monitor will help you make your decision.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="resolution">Resolution </h3>



<p>Most monitors are available in 4K (3,840&times;2,160), 1440p (2,560&times;1,440) and 1080p (1,920&times;1,080) resolution. A higher resolution provides a sharper, more attractive image and is generally preferable. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with 1080p, however. It remains the baseline and is by far the most popular resolution sold today.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="connectivity">Connectivity </h3>



<p>Look for a monitor with a connection supported by your computer. HDMI and DisplayPort are the most common. USB-C is rising in popularity because it can charge connected devices, such as a laptop.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="refresh-rate">Refresh rate </h3>



<p>Most monitors have a 60Hz refresh rate, but a higher refresh rate (such as 144Hz) will make motion look smooth and crisp. This is most appealing to PC gamers, as improved motion performance is most noticeable when panning the camera in a 3D game.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="adaptive-sync">Adaptive sync</h3>



<p>This technology also improves motion performance. It does so by keeping a monitor&rsquo;s refresh rate in sync with the video input from your computer. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/423202/g-sync-vs-freesync-faq-how-variable-refresh-rate-displays-make-pc-games-super-smooth.html">Our guide to FreeSync and G-Sync </a>provides more detail.</p>



<p>Want to know more before you make a decision? <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/535837/monitor_buying_guide.html">Our monitor buying guide</a> explains the nerdy details of monitor specifications.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-we-test-monitors">How we test monitors</h2>



<p>Our monitor guides are based on testing by freelance and staff contributors with decades of combined experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While we rely on our eyes for an initial impression, we thoroughly test each monitor with a SpyderXElite color calibration tool. This specialized hardware can objectively measure a monitor&rsquo;s brightness, contrast, color gamut, color accuracy, luminance and color uniformity, gamma, and many other aspects of image quality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using this tool helps us detect strengths and weaknesses that don&rsquo;t stand out at a glance and guarantees that a change in lighting conditions or monitor location won&rsquo;t skew our impression.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Monitor size depends on personal preference and location.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A 24-inch monitor is fine for a desk that is around 24 inches deep, or less. Its small size will still be sufficient because the monitor is closer to you.</p>



<p>Most people, however, will want to go with a 27-inch monitor. The added size will make the monitor easy to see. This also opens up a wider range of 4K monitor options, as 4K is very rare on a 24-inch monitor.</p>



<p>Larger monitors, such as a 32-inch widescreen or 34-inch ultrawide, are great for deep desks and people who want an immersive experience. Monitors this large can serve as a TV replacement in a small room.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Displays of even larger size, such as 42-inch or 48-inch HDTVs, are best for home theater setups or an unusually large office. You&rsquo;ll want to sit four to six feet away from a display of this size.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-display-input-is-best-hdmi-vs-displayport-vs-usb-c">What display input is best? (HDMI vs. DisplayPort vs. USB-C)</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>USB-C is the best display input for most people. It works by bundling DisplayPort into USB-C, so offers all the same features as DisplayPort. Yet it retains the features of USB-C including optional support for Power Delivery to charge external devices. This is why <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/612470/you-should-buy-a-usb-c-hub-monitor-heres-what-you-need-to-know.html">we recommend a USB-C monitor for most people</a>.</p>



<p>DisplayPort is generally second-best. It supports higher resolutions and refresh rates than HDMI. This input is particularly common on desktop computers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>HDMI comes in third due to lower resolution and refresh rate support. This is improved by HDMI 2.1, but this feature remains hard to find and often adds to a monitor&rsquo;s price.</p>



<p>All three of the options above handle 1080p at 60Hz, which is the most common resolution and refresh rate available today. It&rsquo;s also important to buy a monitor that has an input compatible with your PC.</p>

<p>Modern monitors are compatible with all recent versions of Windows and MacOS. They&rsquo;re plug-and-play, which means the monitor should display an image without the need to install driver software or mess with Windows or MacOS settings.</p>

## Can you play PS5 games directly from an external USB drive?

<p>Sony&rsquo;s PlayStation 5 is now thrilling more than 40 million gamers worldwide, because the game console&rsquo;s powerful hardware, based on AMD&rsquo;s fast Zen 2 and RDNA 2 architectures, is almost on a par with a new gaming PC.</p>



<p>However, the mere 825GB of storage capacity of the internal PCIe SSD repeatedly causes annoyance.</p>



<p>On the one hand, only 667GB of this can be used in a formatted state, as the operating software of the Sony PlayStation 5 also takes its toll in the form of storage space, which is extremely tight anyway given that games that are now 100GB to 150GB in size. On the other hand, the official PS5 expansion with a compatible M.2 SSD costs a relatively high amount of money per gigabyte of storage space.</p>

<p>So what could be more obvious than to expand the PlayStation5&rsquo;s storage via the existing, established USB interface with a large and comparatively very cheap USB hard drive or SSD? First of all, nothing, because a USB drive is perfectly suitable for helping the PlayStation 5 to get more storage space.</p>



<p>But there is a small but very relevant catch. More on that later.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>Further reading: </strong><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406861/best-external-drives.html">The best external drives</a></p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="usb-drives-are-suitable-as-bulk-storage">USB drives are suitable as bulk storage</h2>



<p>Players who run out of storage space on their PlayStation 5 can easily expand it via a USB drive. Currently, the PlayStation 5 officially supports storage media with up to 4TB officially, but SSDs and classic hard drives with 8TB and more have also proven to be absolutely problem-free in everyday use.</p>



<p>Both new games developed specifically for the PlayStation 5 and older games for the PlayStation 4 can then be moved from the internal SSD to the external hard drive or an SSD if desired. This makes it easy to free up storage space for new games on the internal data carrier.</p>



<p>The situation is completely different when players want to start the games archived on the external USB drive from there.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="play-games-from-the-external-drive">Play games from the external drive?</h2>



<p>The question many gamers ask before buying an external USB drive is, &ldquo;Can I play my games directly from the external hard drive?&rdquo;</p>



<p>The answer is no. It is not that simple and it depends especially on the platform for which the game was developed.</p>



<p>According to Sony, you can store the following on a formatted extended USB drive:</p>



<ul>
<li>You can actually play PS4 games that are on an extended USB drive directly from it on your PS5.</li>



<li>You can store PS5 games on an external storage device, but you cannot play them directly from there. You have to copy the game data back to the PS5&rsquo;s internal SSD storage beforehand. The advantage: This is much faster than having to download the game again.</li>
</ul>



<p>By the way: If you have already used an external storage drive with your PS4, you can simply use this with your PS5 and access all PS4 games that are on it.</p>



<p>The bottom line is that games developed for the PlayStation 5 as well as for the PlayStation 4 can be archived on an external storage medium.</p>



<p>However, only games developed for the PlayStation 4 are playable from that drive. Games that were specifically released on the PlayStation 5 must be copied back to the internal data carrier and then launched before playing.</p>

## Secret, helpful Windows 11 settings hiding deep in new preview

<p>In the latest Canary build for Windows 11 Insider preview testers, Microsoft added a new section for system components within the settings app without mentioning it whatsoever. </p>



<p>Even the release notes of Windows 11 build 25926 fail to mention the new feature, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://betanews.com/2023/08/11/microsoft-adds-a-hidden-system-components-section-to-windows-11-settings/&amp;xcust=2-1-2030810-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">as Betanews reports</a>.

<p>The hidden section for system components, which Microsoft has added within the Settings app, can be activated with ViVeTool or <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2022008/how-to-use-microsofts-secret-staging-tool-to-unlock-new-features.html">Microsoft&rsquo;s own leaked internal Staging Tool </a>and offers a list of the applications and tools integrated in Windows 11 and additionally allows uninstalling many of them.</p>



<p>Microsoft probably hasn&rsquo;t yet talked about this new Settings page itself because it is still in a very early testing stage. That said, this is quite a welcome innovation for Windows 11. By grouping system applications and providing easy access to them, Microsoft simplifies the process for anyone who wants to remove unwanted elements from Windows 11.</p>



<p>The move is in line with Microsoft&rsquo;s recent overhaul of the Start menu, which introduced a system label for shortcuts to built-in applications. The company also recently made a similar change to the Microsoft Store.</p>



<p>The new feature was not announced by Microsoft. Instead, it was spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/PhantomOfEarth/status/1689341664119197696&amp;xcust=2-1-2030810-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">PhantomOfEarth</a>, a Twitter account with a strong track record of spotting new features in Windows Insider builds..</p>

<p>Be aware that these Windows builds often contain bugs and can lead to serious problems, however. So do not install a Windows Insider preview build on a critical computer.</p>



<p>Once you&rsquo;re on the latest Windows 11 Insider Canary build, you&rsquo;ll need to enable the System Components feature via the ViVeTool or Microsoft Staging Tool apps. Proceed as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>Download the latest <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://github.com/thebookisclosed/ViVe/releases&amp;xcust=2-1-2030810-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ViVeTool from GitHub</a> and unzip it on your computer.</em></li>



<li><em>Open the command prompt with administrator rights.</em></li>



<li><em>Navigate to the directory where you unpacked the ViVeTool by entering the command &ldquo;cd &lt;path&gt;&rdquo; (replace &lt;path&gt; with the actual path to the ViVeTool).</em></li>



<li><em>Enter the following command and press Enter: <strong>vivetool /enable /id:44702824</strong></em></li>



<li><em>Restart the PC.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>You should now be able to activate the new feature in the settings in the Updates section.</p>



<p>It works similarly with the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2022008/how-to-use-microsofts-secret-staging-tool-to-unlock-new-features.html">Microsoft&rsquo;s leaked internal Staging Tool</a>. If you prefer to use this app, enter the following command:</p>

## LTX interview: Tips on how to build the best budget gaming PC

<p>Building a PC is still the best way to save money versus a pre-built, and if you&rsquo;re already saving money, you probably have a specific budget in mind. At Linus Tech Expo 2023, we collected two experts on the topic: Pedro from <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://pcmasterrace.org/&amp;xcust=2-1-2029944-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PCMR</a> and Oz of the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/@OzTalksHW&amp;xcust=2-1-2029944-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">OzTalksHW channel</a>. They&rsquo;re here to share tips and insight on how to get the most bang for your buck for the most economical desktop gaming PC builds out there. </p>



<p>Both Oz and Pedro would say budget desktop gaming now starts at around the $700 range, which is a significant rise over what it used to be. A $700 machine should be able to handle all new games, if not with 4K resolution or the most impressive visual effects. Stepping up to the $1000 level is great for mid-range for both gaming and video production. To go below that level you might consider used machines, or going for an older build on sale and upgrading it with newer parts. </p>

<p>Having trouble? Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask for help. As has always been the case, the community is extremely helpful, especially on subreddits, Discord groups, sites like PCMR and even YouTube comments. Even with somewhat tepid advances in the CPU and GPU markets, it&rsquo;s a great time to build a PC, thanks to super-low prices on older hardware and components like storage and RAM. The last-gen <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393729/amd-radeon-rx-6800-rx-6800-xt-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393472/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-founders-edition-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Nvidia RTX 3080</a> are both great deals.  </p>

## Get this curved 1440p Acer gaming monitor for just $160

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a curved gaming monitor on the cheap, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place. Costco&rsquo;s currently selling the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.costco.com/acer-27%e2%80%9d-class-wqhd-curved-gaming-monitor.product.4000114895.html&amp;xcust=2-2-2030647-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Acer Class WQHD curved gaming monitor for just $159.99</a>, which is $90 off of the original $249.99 price. This monitor has a resolution of 2560&times;1440 and a refresh rate of 165Hz, which is the perfect combination for competitive gameplay. Given those specs, visuals should be deliciously smooth. </p>



<p>The 27-inch Acer monitor has a 1ms response time, AMD FreeSync, and a cool zero frame design. AMD FreeSync is always useful, as it helps reduce any screen tearing issues. It achieves this by syncing up the monitor&rsquo;s refresh rate with your PC&rsquo;s GPU. According to one buyer, they found the &ldquo;colors and deep blacks to be stunning.&rdquo; I know I&rsquo;d definitely play <em>Baldurs Gate 3</em> on this monitor, as it seems like it&rsquo;s capable of delivering the ultimate gaming experience.</p>



<p>This is a solid deal, but I don&rsquo;t expect it to last very long. I&rsquo;d recommend swooping in sooner rather than later.</p>

## Gigabyte’s new 34-inch ultrawide monitor could be a budget hit

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>34-inch ultrawide monitors, with a spacious 3440&times;1440 resolution, are a hit with gamers. (And PCWorld writers &mdash; I&rsquo;m looking at one right now.) The extra-wide field of view is great for immersion, and the resolution is sharp without being as heavy on the GPU as a 4K screen. But these monitors don&rsquo;t come cheap&hellip;at least most of the time. Gigabyte&rsquo;s G34WQC from 2020 is a budget hit in this category, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/628661/628661.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">frequently going on sale for under $400</a>. The newest version of the screen, the GS34WQC, might just follow in its footsteps. </p>



<p>The monitor shares most of the core specifications of its predecessor, most notably the 34-inch, 3440&times;1440 LCD panel with 1ms response time and a dramatic 1500R curve, much more pronounced than most of the screens in this category. (PCWorld&rsquo;s favorite, the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/search?q=dell+oled+review#gsc.tab=0&amp;gsc.q=dell%20oled%20review&amp;gsc.page=1" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">new Alienware OLEDs</a>, have a 1800R curve factor.) Connectivity remains the same, with a single DisplayPort 1.4, two HDMI 2.0 ports, and a headphone jack. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.gigabyte.com/Monitor/GS34WQC#kf&amp;xcust=2-2-2030619-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">rest of the spec list</a> is a bit of a remix, with some being higher and some lower than the older design. For example, while the maximum refresh rate on the VA panel is a smidge lower at 135hz and brightness drops from 350 nits to 300, the contrast ratio is 33% higher at 4000:1. The new design also drops the dual 5-watt speakers, and I doubt anyone will miss them. It looks like the GS34WQC is probably a refreshed design with a new primary LCD panel at its core, possibly from a new supplier. But the focus on affordable gaming capability without any extra frills, like RGB lighting or a USB hub, could make it a hit for buyers looking for a deal. </p>



<p>There&rsquo;s no retail price or release date mentioned on Gigabyte&rsquo;s promotional site (spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.kitguru.net/peripherals/monitors/joao-silva/gigabyte-introduces-new-34-inch-ultrawide-monitor-with-qhd-resolution/&amp;xcust=2-2-2030619-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">KitGuru</a>). But the previous model launched at $450 almost exactly three years ago, and it frequently goes on sale (in fact it&rsquo;s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/p/N82E16824012046&amp;xcust=2-2-2030619-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">just $370 on Newegg today</a>).

<p>Google recently announced that it will <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://Google%20is%20taking%20the%20next%20step%20in%20deleting%20Google%20accounts%20that%20are%20no%20longer%20used,%20sending%20an%20email%20to%20all%20account%20holders.&amp;xcust=2-2-2030660-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">start deleting Google accounts</a> that have been inactive for two years. Now, the company is making sure everyone knows about it, sending Gmail users a message informing people about the account inactive account policy. These messages are being sent to all Gmail users, not only to Gmail accounts that could affected by deletion.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-to-recognize-google-account-deletion-emails">How to recognize Google account deletion emails</h2>



<p>Google&rsquo;s emails use the subject line &ldquo;Updating our Google Account inactivity policy&rdquo; and come from the address &ldquo;no-reply@accounts.google.com.&rdquo; In it, Google delivers a high-level summary of the new account deletion policy:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&ldquo;We are updating the inactivity period for a Google Account to two years across all our products and services. This change starts rolling out today and will apply to any Google Account that&rsquo;s been inactive, meaning it has not been signed into or used within a two-year period. An inactive account and any content in it will be eligible for deletion from December 1, 2023.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the following section, Google explains that only those users are affected who &ldquo;have been inactive in your Google Account for two years or have not used your account to sign in to any Google service for over two years.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Google emphasizes in the email that although the changes would take effect today (13 August 2023), it will delete accounts in December 2023 at the earliest.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-happens-if-your-inactive-google-account-may-be-deleted">What happens if your inactive Google account may be deleted</h2>



<p>If Google deems your account inactive, it will send several reminder emails to both the affected email address and your <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/7299973&amp;xcust=2-2-2030660-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">account recovery</a> email address (if you provided one) before taking action or deleting account content. Google intends to send these reminder emails at least eight months in advance. So you have plenty of time.</p>



<p>After Google has deleted a Google account, the Gmail address of the deleted account can no longer be used to create a new Google account.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-to-prevent-google-account-deletion">How to prevent Google account deletion</h2>



<p>Google explains how easy it is to prevent a Google account from being deleted: &ldquo;The simplest way to keep a Google Account active is to sign in to the account at least once every two years. If you have signed in to your Google Account recently in the past two years, your account is considered active and will not be deleted.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Alternatively, you can also prevent deletion by doing the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>Read or send an email</li>



<li>Use Google Drive</li>



<li>Watch a YouTube video</li>



<li>Share a photo</li>



<li>Download an app</li>



<li>Use Google Search</li>

<p>The Crucial X10 Pro, as you might guess from its name, is aimed at the prosumer market. Pros who might normally shop Thunderbolt 3/4 for maximum performance. </p>



<p>However, the X10 Pro performs nearly as well as the Thunderbolt 3 competition in our real-world transfers, yet at $120 for 1TB is $40 cheaper than the 10Gbps/T3 <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1931773/sandisk-pro-g40-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Sandisk Po-G40</a>. Sounds like a good pro-position to us.</p>

<p>At the time of this writing, the X10 Pro was also available in a $170/2TB version, meaning you can bag another TB for only $10 more than the aforementioned Pro-G40 (1TB/$160). It&rsquo;s also quite a bit smaller than its competitor at 2.56 inches long, 1.97-inches wide, and only 0.38-inches thick. </p>

<p>The X10 Pro weighs in at around 1.5 ounces, and is <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/578310/ip-ratings-explained.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">IP55 rated</a>. That means it can to keep enough dust and water spray  out to maintain functionality, though drop it in a pool and all bets are off. </p>



<p>The drive connects via a Type-C connector (Crucial bundles a Type-C to Type-C cable) and also has a hole for a lanyard on its upper left corner. The activity light resides within said cavity.</p>



<p>Alas, no Type-C to Type-A adapter is included, so purchase one of those if you have the need. It should go without saying that a 20Gbps SSD is pricey overkill unless you have the matching 20Gbps port, which is almost always Type-C. </p>



<p>Crucial has promised a utility for September, 2023 that will allow you to lock and unlock data on the X9 Pro. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The Crucial X10 Pro is an excellent performer, and the nearest thing to Thunderbolt 3 you&rsquo;ll find in a 20Gbps USB SSD.</p></blockquote></figure>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img alt="Crucial X10 Pro back" class="wp-image-2024478" height="814" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/x10-pro-back-b.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>The back of the Crucial X10 Pro.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jon L. Jacobi</p></div>



<p>The X10 Pro is charcoal gray, which distinguishes it from its lighter, silver-gray, 10Gbps cousin&ndash;the X9 Pro&ndash;which I&rsquo;ll review next. Both feature anti-slip coatings on the bottom.</p>



<p>Crucial warranties the X10 Pro for five years (limited), however, the company didn&rsquo;t provide TBW (total terabytes written) ratings, which are no doubt the limiting factor, the way mileage is in an automobile warranty. No company that I&rsquo;m aware of will turn down a warranty claim unless the drive has truly been savaged write-wise&mdash;i.e., used in a server 24/7.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-does-the-crucial-x10-pro-perform">How does the Crucial X10 Pro perform?</h2>



<p>While the X10 Pro didn&rsquo;t blow our socks off in the synthetic benchmarks, it was truly excellent in our real-world testing&ndash;beating two Thunderbolt 3 competitors in the 48GB transfers. Hence the discussion and inclusion of the dual 10Gbps/Thunderbolt 3 Sandisk Pro-G40 in the charts.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-2022391" height="606" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Crucial-X10-Pro-CDM8-seq.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The X10 Pro&rsquo;s CrystalDiskMark 8 sequential throughput was very good, though not as good as its 48GB transfer numbers. Here the Thunderbolt 3 SSD has a clear advantage.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Note that the better random performance of Pro-G40 (almost twice as fast) would make it the best choice for running alternative operating systems. Random ops are not the X10 Pro&rsquo;s forte&mdash;however, it was within spitting distance of its 20Gbps competitors.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-2024343" height="606" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Crucial-X10-Pro-CDM8-rnd.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure></div>



<p>The latest generation of SSDs has improved quite a bit performance-wise, but we&rsquo;re not sure if it&rsquo;s the NAND, the controllers, or both. Likely the combination in some ratio favoring the NAND. Whatever the case, the 48GB transfer numbers (below) for the X10 Pro really are pro.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-2022394" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Crucial-X10-Pro-48GB.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The 48GB transfer tests were where the X10 Pro made hay. Shorter bars are better.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The X10 Pro was also highly competitive in the 450GB write, which was not actually enough data to force it to write natively. It took another 900GB file written twice, but the results were rather dismal once it went south&ndash;50MBps. Given 2TB of capacity, you shouldn&rsquo;t experience that slowdown very often, if at all.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img alt="Crucial X10 Pro 450GB" class="wp-image-2022398" height="584" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Crucial-X10-Pro-450GB-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1172" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The X10 Pro also did very well in the 450GB write.  And yes, the Kingston XS2000&rsquo;s time is rather tragic. Shorter bars are better.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jon L. Jacobi</p></div>



<p>Overall, the Crucial X10 Pro is an excellent performer, and the nearest thing to Thunderbolt 3 you&rsquo;ll find in a 20Gbps USB SSD.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="should-you-buy-the-crucial-x10-pro-usb-ssd">Should you buy the Crucial X10 Pro USB SSD?</h2>



<p>If you want top-flight real-world performance and can&rsquo;t use, or don&rsquo;t want to pay for Thunderbolt 3, then the Crucial X10 Pro is what you want.</p>

<p>In recent weeks, Windows 11 Insider preview testers have had access to a helpful new feature in the Microsoft Store app: Generative AI-based summaries of the latest user reviews of individual apps. Now, that feature appears to be rolling out to the the stable, public version of Windows 11, along with an AI hub in the Microsoft Store.</p>



<p>Twitter user <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/PhantomOfEarth/status/1690223333546082304&amp;xcust=2-1-2030604-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Phantomocean3</a>, an account that has spotted several new unannounced features and upgrades in Windows builds in the past, discovered that the Microsoft Stores&rsquo; AI summaries are now becoming available to the public. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://mspoweruser.com/microsoft-makes-it-easier-to-quickly-learn-about-reviews-on-microsoft-store-apps/&amp;xcust=2-1-2030604-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">MSPowerUser</a> first reported about the discovery.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Judging by the example above, the new Microsoft Store review summaries seem to be somewhat positive in their approach. The generative AI seems to specifically highlight features that users have liked about the app. It isn&rsquo;t clear whether Microsoft&rsquo;s new AI will also be able to categorize apps according to particular criticisms they have received from users. </p>



<p>Microsoft has been working hard at integrating AI into Windows 11 in recent months, leveraging its deep partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI. Not only has the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1526807/hands-on-how-to-use-bing-chat-within-windows-11.html">AI Bing Chat been worked into the operating system</a>, but Microsoft also unveiled a forthcoming <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1974843/windows-copilot-cant-decide-what-it-is.html">AI-powered Windows Copilot tool</a>, and upgrades for <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1661649/forget-bing-microsoft-365-copilot-looks-like-ais-killer-app.html">Office that could be AI&rsquo;s killer app.</a></p>

## Should you upgrade your PC or buy a new computer? A guide

<p>Your PC takes more and more time to boot, browser tabs open only slowly, the videos from the last holiday cannot be edited as desired or the newly purchased game jerks across the monitor. Sooner or later, every PC reaches its performance limits, regardless of whether it&rsquo;s used in the office, for productive work, for creative applications, or for gaming. </p>



<p>However, this does not always have to result in a new purchase. Often it&rsquo;s enough to replace just one component to make the PC fit again. First of all, it&rsquo;s important to find out which component is the limiting factor in order to decide whether upgrading the computer or buying a new one makes more sense. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="when-does-upgrading-your-pc-make-sense">When does upgrading your PC make sense?</h2>



<p>A desktop PC is modular. Therefore, it is usually easy to replace a component&mdash;provided you have a certain technical understanding. If you are confident enough to do the upgrade yourself or have an expert at hand, there is nothing to stop you from upgrading, although you should bear a few points in mind. </p>



<p>Upgrading a PC primarily makes sense if you can achieve a large increase in performance with the purchase of only a few components and low expenditure. For example, if your PC still has an old HDD installed, you can significantly speed up the start of the operating system and programs by purchasing an SSD without having to replace the rest of the components.</p>



<p>Or if you no longer have enough RAM, but your mainboard still has free RAM slots, you can simply install additional RAM modules. Upgrading the graphics card can also make sense if the processor is bored in games, the power supply unit is sufficiently dimensioned for a faster GPU, and the case offers enough space.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="advantages-of-upgrading-your-pc">Advantages of upgrading your PC:</h3>



<ul>
<li>Cheaper: Replacing just one component saves a lot of money compared to buying new</li>



<li>Saves time: You don&rsquo;t have to set up a new PC, install all the necessary programs, and move your data</li>



<li>Of course, it is also more sustainable to replace only parts of the PC and not the whole computer</li>
</ul>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>Further reading:</strong> See our guide to the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394287/best-tools-for-pc-building.html">10 essential tools for PC building</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="when-does-it-make-sense-to-buy-a-new-pc">When does it make sense to buy a new PC?</h2>



<p>But there are also some arguments in favor of a new purchase. If your PC is on its last legs and lacks everything, then upgrading makes little sense. If you have to invest more than half the money you would have spent on a new PC for an upgrade, buying a new one is usually the more sensible solution in the long run. </p>



<p>Often it&rsquo;s not even possible to simply upgrade a component, such as the graphics card. Installing a faster GPU requires, firstly, that the power supply delivers enough power and has the necessary connections, and secondly, that there is enough space in the case. If one or both of these requirements are not met, it can quickly become expensive to replace even more components.</p>



<p>The same applies to upgrading the processor. Especially for motherboards with Intel chipsets, it is common that a new processor socket with new chipsets follows after two CPU generations. If you want to upgrade to a new processor, this may mean that you also need a new motherboard and, in case of doubt, new RAM. </p>



<p>Another argument for a new purchase is compatibility with current software. Windows 11, for example, requires a reasonably up-to-date processor, which, as described above, may mean that you have to upgrade significantly more components. Another plus point is the warranty, because both when you buy individual components for do-it-yourself construction and when you buy a finished PC, you get a manufacturer&rsquo;s warranty on the product. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="advantages-of-buying-a-new-pc">Advantages of buying a new PC:</h3>



<ul>
<li>Warranty: With a new PC you get a warranty on all components, with ready-made PCs</li>



<li>Efficiency: New processors and graphics cards are usually much more efficient than their predecessors&mdash;so in the long run you reduce your electricity costs</li>



<li>The latest technologies and interfaces make the PC future-proof&mdash;and you benefit from technical progress</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="which-components-are-worth-upgrading">Which components are worth upgrading?</h2>



<p>Since desktop PCs are modular, you can basically replace any component, but in the case of the power supply unit this only makes sense for efficiency reasons and in the case of the housing only for aesthetic reasons. The components that are responsible for system performance are the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>System memory/storage (HDD or SSD)</li>



<li>Main memory</li>



<li>Graphics card</li>



<li>Processor</li>



<li>CPU cooler and fan</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="upgrade-system-memory">Upgrade system memory</h2>



<p>If your PC seems to take half an eternity to start up or open programs, it&rsquo;s possible that the operating system is installed on an old HDD. In this case, upgrading to an SSD will significantly speed up all system operations. Before upgrading, the first thing to do is to find out which interfaces are actually available in your PC, the two most common being SATA and NVMe. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="upgrade-your-ram">Upgrade your RAM</h2>



<p>If programs start slowly or opening new tabs in the browser takes a noticeable amount of time, this is an indication that the RAM is no longer sufficient. The Windows Task Manager can be used to check whether this is the case. </p>



<p>The quickest way to open the task manager is to use the key combination <strong>Ctrl + Shift + Esc</strong><em>.</em> In the task manager, switch to the <em>Performance </em>tab and then to <em>Memory.</em> There you can read the percentage utilization of the installed RAM. If the value is 90 percent or higher, you should definitely consider upgrading the RAM. </p>



<p>Even for an office PC, we recommend at least 8GB RAM nowadays, better 16GB. We also recommend 16GB for a gaming PC, although 32GB can&rsquo;t hurt here, depending on the title. The same applies if you use your PC for creative work, such as video editing or 3D renderings.</p>



<p>Before you do this, however, you should clarify a few important questions: What RAM capacity and speed does the built-in processor support? How many RAM slots does the motherboard have and are there any free slots? Which RAM modules are currently installed&mdash;the DDR type, clock rates and latencies are of particular interest here. </p>

<p>Upgrading your graphics card is especially worthwhile for gamers and creative users. However, there is a lot more to consider here than when upgrading an SSD or RAM. First of all, it&rsquo;s important to find out whether the GPU or the CPU or RAM is the limiting factor. After all, if the processor is the bottleneck, it won&rsquo;t do you any good to install a faster graphics card.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>Further reading:</strong> <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1955495/pc-bottlenecks-cpu-or-cpu-limiting-gaming-performance.html">PC bottlenecks explained</a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Once you have identified the graphics card as the limiting factor, the question must be asked whether an upgrade makes sense. At this point, it is first necessary to find out how much power the installed power supply delivers and which PCIe power connections it has, because a faster graphics card may also require more power&mdash;in case of doubt, you will need a stronger power supply. It is also important to check whether there is enough space in your case for the graphics card you want. If the selected model cannot be installed, a larger case may be necessary. </p>



<p>Last but not least, you should check which PCIe generation your processor and motherboard support. PCIe is backwards compatible, which means that you can use a graphics card with PCIe 4.0 in a PCIe 3.0 slot, but this will lead to a loss of performance.</p>



<p>Our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/416006/the-best-graphics-cards-for-pc-gaming.html">best graphics cards for gaming</a> provides help in choosing the ideal graphics card for your requirements.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="upgrade-the-processor">Upgrade the processor</h2>



<p>The hardest part is upgrading the processor, because this is where you need to pay the most attention. First, you have to find out whether the processor is the limiting factor and not the graphics card or the RAM. Once you have answered this question, you need to find out which processors your motherboard is compatible with. </p>



<p>The CPU socket, the TDP (Themal Design Power), and the BIOS updates of the motherboard manufacturer play an important role here. The easiest way to find out which motherboard you have installed is to open the Run window with the key combination <strong>Windows + R</strong> and enter &ldquo;msinfo32&rdquo;. </p>

<p>In the system overview, search for the entries <em>BaseBoard manufacturer</em>, <em> product</em>, and <em> version</em>. You can then find the information on the compatible CPUs on the motherboard manufacturer&rsquo;s website.</p>



<p>If you find out at this stage that a faster processor is not available for your motherboard, you will need a new motherboard and possibly also new RAM&mdash;a new power supply unit may also be necessary in this context. </p>



<p>Even if a faster processor is available, but it&rsquo;s already more than three years old and no longer available new, such an upgrade is often not advisable. Firstly, because older processors + motherboards do not offer modern interfaces such as PCIe Gen 4 and Gen 5, Wi-Fi 6(E), USB4 etc., and secondly, because they may also not be compatible with current software such as Windows 11. </p>

</blockquote>



<p>Last but not least, you need to make sure that your currently installed CPU cooler is sufficiently dimensioned to adequately cool a faster&mdash;and thus often power-hungry&mdash;processor. Otherwise, you will have to look for a stronger cooler, which we will come to next. In any case, you will still need thermal paste during the conversion.</p>

<p>Ah, Chromebooks. What an ever-evolving journey we&rsquo;ve seen so far. When they first materialized into existence, Chromebooks were a popular option for students due to their durable frames and affordable price points. They were (and still are) designed to be everyday machines. Nowadays, there are even <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1677622/lenovo-ideapad-5-gaming-chromebook-review.html">cloud-ready gaming Chromebooks</a>, which are super rad and something I never thought I&rsquo;d see. While I&rsquo;ve evaluated all sorts of Chromebooks, from modern 2-in-1s to machines made of recycled material, this time I&rsquo;m reviewing the IdeaPad Slim 3 Chromebook. Lenovo&rsquo;s latest offering is definitely a more conservative approach, but that isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing.</p>



<p>The IdeaPad Slim 3 Chromebook is a decent value buy. The design is simple yet effective, the frame feels strong and well-built, and performance is reliable, especially during day-to-day tasks. Battery life is fantastic too, making it a good option for young professionals or college students. You can&rsquo;t really beat the price, either. The thing is the specs aren&rsquo;t all that impressive. That said, I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s fair to dock it for its hardware. This is a Chromebook, after all, and it&rsquo;s only capable of so much. This clamshell might be far from reinventing the wheel, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to. Why mess with the formula if it works? You&rsquo;ll find nothing but the basics here. Read on to learn more.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="lenovo-ideapad-slim-3-chromebook-design-and-build-quality">Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 Chromebook: Design and build quality</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Lenovo Slim 3 design" class="wp-image-2012191" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lenovo-slim-3-design.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Ashley Biancuzzo</p></div>



<p>My first impression of every laptop I review starts with the moment I slide or lift it out of the box. When I first held the IdeaPad Slim 3 Chromebook in my hands, I was pleased with how light it felt. It weighs just under three pounds, which slots it in the ultraportable category. I don&rsquo;t commute to work, so I can&rsquo;t speak to the experience of taking it with me on the subway. That said, as a full-time remote worker, toting the Slim 3 around my house was both easy and effortless.</p>



<p>The design is subtle and sophisticated, something of a quiet beauty. I&rsquo;m especially fond of the textured finish on the lid. If you run your hand across the lid, you&rsquo;ll find one side is smooth while the other has little raised bumps. It&rsquo;s a minuscule detail, but it adds a bit of much needed luxury to the overall device. The &ldquo;Abyss Blue&rdquo; color scheme is also quite lovely. The color isn&rsquo;t distracting at all and it looks super sleek under the right lights.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="lenovo-ideapad-slim-3-chromebook-keyboard-trackpad">Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 Chromebook: Keyboard, trackpad</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Lenovo Slim 3 keyboard" class="wp-image-2012177" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lenovo-slim-3-keyboard.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Ashley Biancuzzo</p></div>



<p>I didn&rsquo;t struggle much with the keyboard or trackpad, as they&rsquo;re quite similar to my personal Chromebook. I tend to sit folded up like origami when I&rsquo;m in bed, often with my laptop precariously balanced on my legs. (It&rsquo;s probably why I often experience muscle soreness.) This position makes it very difficult to successfully use a laptop keyboard. However, when sitting up like a normal human being and using the Slim 3 at a table, I enjoyed the typing experience. The keys felt springy and typos were a rare phenomenon. </p>



<p>The trackpad was equally easy to get accustomed to. The trackpad sits in the center of the keyboard deck, which is what I prefer. There&rsquo;s nothing more aggravating than an off-center trackpad. Some folks like them, but they really ruin my day. As for using the trackpad, it registered my taps and swipes just fine. The surface felt really smooth, almost like it was made out of glass (I don&rsquo;t believe this is the case). There were only a few misfires here and there.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The Slim 3&rsquo;s 47 watt-hour battery kicked some serious butt. When I ran the battery benchmark, which cycles through various tasks until the laptop dies, the Chromebook breathed its last metaphorical breath at the 16 hour mark.</p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="lenovo-ideapad-slim-3-chromebook-display-audio">Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 Chromebook: Display, audio</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Lenovo Slim 3 display" class="wp-image-2012212" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lenovo-slim-3-display.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Ashley Biancuzzo</p></div>



<p>I was surprised by the quality of the Slim 3&rsquo;s touch display. It measures 14 inches and has a resolution of 1920&times;1080, which is fine for everyday tasks like email and browsing the web. When I watched the first episode of the new <em>Futurama</em> series, colors looked nice and smaller details like the bits and bobs inside Planet Express were crisp. The bezels are relatively thin as well, which gives you more screen space. The maximum brightness level is around 300 nits. It&rsquo;s fine for indoor use, but you won&rsquo;t be able to see much on the screen if you decide to take this machine outside. </p>



<p>The speakers sound decent. It&rsquo;s a user-facing speaker system, so the sound is coming right at you. When I played one of my favorite <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIVa5xjArsk&amp;xcust=2-1-2007550-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Lofi channels on YouTube</a>, it was loud enough to fill my dining room, which is a medium-sized space that stems off of my kitchen. The speakers use Waves Max Audio, which is supposed to enhance the overall audio performance. The speakers are fine for playing music and whatnot, but I wasn&rsquo;t super blown away or anything. It&rsquo;s definitely not like being in an IMAX theatre. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="lenovo-ideapad-slim-3-chromebook-webcam">Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 Chromebook: Webcam</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Lenovo Slim 3 webcam" class="wp-image-2012178" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lenovo-slim-3-webcam.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Ashley Biancuzzo</p></div>



<p>I&rsquo;m of the mind that all laptops should come with 1080p webcams, as remote work is more common these days. Unfortunately, the Slim 3&rsquo;s 720p webcam is a real sticking point for me. As someone who works from home, I&rsquo;d prefer to look as crisp as possible during videoconferencing calls. When I recorded a video of myself typing away on the keyboard, I was disappointed in the quality of the picture. The straps of my purple dress looked washed out and background details like the swaying tree outside my window appeared a bit fuzzy.

<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Lenovo Slim 3 ports" class="wp-image-2012180" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lenovo-slim-3-ports.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Ashley Biancuzzo</p></div>



<p>The port selection is fine, but nothing real noteworthy. You&rsquo;re getting one Kensington lock slot, one USB-C 3.2 Gen 1, one USB-A 3.2 Gen 1, one headphone/microphone jack, and one microSD card reader. It&rsquo;s enough for the everyday person, as some folks prefer plugging into an external monitor or mouse. It&rsquo;s good to have options, yeah? You probably don&rsquo;t need to bring an adapter with you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="lenovo-ideapad-slim-3-chromebook-performance">Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 Chromebook: Performance</h2>



<p>Look, I&rsquo;m going to level with you here. The Slim 3 isn&rsquo;t the most powerful laptop I&rsquo;ve ever tested at PCWorld, but that&rsquo;s not what it was designed for. If you&rsquo;re using the device for general-use purposes (browsing social media, checking email, and so on), then it&rsquo;s entirely serviceable. Anything more demanding than that and you&rsquo;ll likely see a bit of a slowdown. When I had a bunch of tabs open in my browser, I did notice a slight slowdown when loading up a fresh page or navigating to another open tab. That&rsquo;s not surprising, as there&rsquo;s only 4GB of RAM. RAM directly impacts web browsing speed, which is why I recommend at least 8GB for casual use. </p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s how the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 Chromebook performed in our browser-based benchmarks:</p>



<ul>
<li>CrXPRT 2: 73</li>



<li>Speedometer: 29.6</li>



<li>Basemark Web 3.0: 302.97</li>



<li>Kraken: 2137.8ms</li>



<li>Jetstream 2: 74.077</li>
</ul>



<p>Compared to Chromebooks with Intel or AMD processors, the Slim 3 falls behind (but not by much). The Asus Chromebook CM34 Flip, for example, had a CrXPRT 2 score of 148 and a Speedometer score of 73.7. The Flip came equipped with an AMD processor, which is more powerful than the Slim&rsquo;s MediaTek Kompanio 520. That said, MediaTek CPUs are designed to fit inside light and portable laptops, which the Slim 3 definitely is. So, you&rsquo;ve got to pick your poison here. Either you go with a slightly slower but more portable laptop or a heavier one with zippier performance.</p>



<p>By the way, the CrXPRT 2 performance benchmark measures things like how fast your Chromebook completes tasks and the Speedometer benchmark captures the responsiveness of the web applications. These benchmarks are good indicators of how a Chromebook will perform under different loads. It should also be noted that because Chromebooks get updated every six weeks, the test results aren&rsquo;t always going to line up perfectly. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="lenovo-ideapad-slim-3-chromebook-battery-life">Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 Chromebook: Battery life</h2>



<p>The Slim 3&rsquo;s 47 watt-hour battery kicked some serious butt. When I ran the battery benchmark, which cycles through various tasks until the laptop dies, the Chromebook breathed its last metaphorical breath at the 16 hour mark. That&rsquo;s a great result, especially if you plan on taking this laptop everywhere with you. However, generally speaking, Chromebooks tend to have great battery life, so I&rsquo;m not surprised by the result. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="lenovo-ideapad-slim-3-chromebook-should-you-buy-it">Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 Chromebook: Should you buy it?</h2>



<p>The Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 is a perfectly serviceable Chromebook. Although it&rsquo;s not the most innovative laptop I&rsquo;ve ever worked with, it&rsquo;s still a good value buy, especially if you&rsquo;re a student or young professional. It has enough power for light use and the battery will keep you going long after your workday ends. The inclusion of a 1080p touch display is a nice feature to have on a sub-$400 laptop. Performance could be a touch snappier, but that&rsquo;s just my own personal nitpick. You&rsquo;ll need to taper your expectations some, especially as this machine has only 4GB of RAM. If you need an inexpensive everyday machine, then the IdeaPad Slim 3 Chromebook is worth your hard-earned cash.</p>
