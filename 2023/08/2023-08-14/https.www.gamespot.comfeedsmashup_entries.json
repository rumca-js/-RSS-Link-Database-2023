This movie, known in Japan as Super Mario: Goddess of the Demon Empire, will hit cinemas there, providing audiences a chance to revisit the cult classic. Japanese data and information company <a href=\"https://www.oricon.co.jp/news/2290128/photo/1/\">Oricon</a> has a neon-flecked poster worth checking out--even if you aren't in Japan and can't make it out for a screening.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The film, starring Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo as the iconic plumber siblings, still occupies a polarizing but important place in videogame cinematic history. Debuting in 1993, it took an unexpected turn by placing the Mario Bros. in the lively and distinct universe of Dinohattan--a parallel realm inhabited by humanoid descendants of dinosaurs. Samantha Mathis played Princess Daisy, while Dennis Hopper portrayed President Koopa. Despite initial criticism, the movie's lasting charm has resulted in a global fan base for what still stands largely as a cult hit.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The newer movie hasn't been without its detractors.

It's gritty like no other, unflinching in its brutality, and downright terrifying as often as it wants to be. Bringing those same qualities to a video game adaptation of the movie milestone would be paramount, which is exactly what Gun Media and Sumo Nottingham have done. <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-texas-chain-saw-massacre/\">The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</a> (TCM) is every bit as nauseatingly tense as the classic movie, all while cleverly gamifying its scares in ways that are satisfying and built for the long haul.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Asymmetrical horror multiplayer games have been experiencing a golden age for several years now, but TCM is already my favorite of them. In TCM, a unique 4v3 setup allows each round to play out like an actual horror movie. What I didn't realize until I played it for review is that to properly balance this particular game, creating an even playing field isn't necessarily the best approach. Each round is a horror story, and its team of \"victims\" intentionally have the odds stacked against them, often coming down to just one Final Girl (or Guy) who might limp off the property to salvation. The high-stakes game of hide-and-seek is better for it.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">A cast of five victims and five Slaughter family members, including two newly created characters who fit right into the world, make up the roster. While those playing the family have what are essentially class-based villains to pick from, the victims are closer in performance to each other, save for a special ability they each uniquely possess and starting stats that make up their various but customizable builds. As the victims start out in the basement impaled on meat hooks, the goal is simple and exciting in horror movie terms: Get the hell out of there. That encompasses first needing to climb off the hook, then unlocking an escape route, then traversing a labyrinthine and treacherous outside section no matter which of the game's three maps they're on, all while being hunted. Needless to say, survival is never easy.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-texas-chain-saw-massacre-review-thrill-of-the-hunt/1900-6418102/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-texas-chain-saw-massacre-review-thrill-of-the-hunt/1900-6418102/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-08-14T19:13:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Pokemon Scarlet And Violet DLC Will Feature All Previous Starter Pokemon", "description": "<p>During the closing ceremonies of the 2023 Pokemon World Championships in Yokohama, Japan, a new trailer for Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet And Violet: The Hidden Treasure Of Area Zero Part 2 - The Indigo Disk debuted.

Revenant's role in Apex Legends' story has consistently been the silent villain, the omnipresent threat to the rest of the legends. But with Duardo--Octane's grandfather--beginning to take the reins as the game's big bad, it seems like it's finally time to see Revenant narratively grow beyond the reputation he's cultivated for so long.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"Revenant has always been someone who, ever since we've known him, he's never chosen to be a simulacrum or anything that was out of his control, and he really hates feeling like he doesn't have any agency,\" Respawn writer Jaclyn Seto told me during a press roundtable. \"So these changes that happened to him are a pretty big blow and he's really struggling with that. And so that's something that we wanted to bring to the forefront of his story this season, and you'll see how he deals with that over the course of Kill Code's story.\"</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Following that up, IGN's Stella Chung asked whether that means fans can expect to see a conclusion to Revenant's arc, regardless of what that might entail. Revenant's big goal, after all, is regaining control of his life by killing himself. It would be tricky for him to finally achieve his goal given that Apex Legends is a live-service game that needs to keep going for as long as it can and Respawn just offing one of the game's main characters and removing him from the roster is probably not conducive to keeping players invested.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/respawn-wants-to-move-apex-legends-storyline-between-revenant-and-loba-along/1100-6516825/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/respawn-wants-to-move-apex-legends-storyline-between-revenant-and-loba-along/1100-6516825/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-08-14T15:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Why Apex Legends Changed Revenant From Assault To Skirmisher", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/revenant-guide-apex-legends/1100-6473464/\">Revenant</a> has gone through quite a substantial transformation with the start of <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-18-revenants-new-abilities-no-more-skydive-trails-and-double-xp/1100-6516547/\">Apex Legends Season 18</a>, adopting brand-new abilities to match his monstrous new form. As part of that change, the previously Assault class legend has moved over to the Skirmisher category. According to Respawn, this change was done to better reflect Revenant's depiction in the battle royale game's story.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"As far as changing him over to Skirmisher, that didn't come [because] we wanted to move him to Skirmisher and that [decision] influenced the rework,\" Apex Legends game designer Evan Funnell told me. \"It was mostly that we had a goal in mind for where we wanted Revenant to be to match him closer to the lore--or to his fantasy--and to his narrative.\"</p><p dir=\"ltr\">There's a tricky distinction between both Assault and Skirmisher. Unlike the other classes where legends have fairly distinct roles, legends in both the Assault and Skirmisher classes can have similarly movement-oriented and damage-dealing abilities. After this past season--which saw Mirage move from Skirmisher to Support--it seemed like the main difference between the two classes when movement-oriented abilities were involved was in how they are usually used. Assault legends primarily use their abilities to initiate fights while Skirmisher legends can use their abilities to initiate or escape.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-apex-legends-changed-revenant-from-assault-to-skirmisher/1100-6516824/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-apex-legends-changed-revenant-from-assault-to-skirmisher/1100-6516824/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-08-14T15:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "It's (Turtle) Time To Check Out This TMNT: Cowabunga Collection Deal", "description": "<p>If you're in the mood for some more Turtle Time after watching Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, you can save on The Cowabunga Collection at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Teenage-Turtles-Cowabunga-Collection-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B09W39YNQV?tag=gamespot-promos-20\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1816798766334427308?u1=subid_value\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100770772-13142092?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://electronics.woot.com/offers/tmnt-cowabunga-collection-limited-edition\">Woot</a>.
