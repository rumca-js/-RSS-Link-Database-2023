The price tag for the system was 1,400,000 Czech korunas (around US$63,500) excluding VAT, a contract dating from 2020 shows. The documents did not reveal the maker of the facial recognition software.\n\nThe facial recognition system relies on images from government identity card and travel document registers. In its report, the organization warns about the system\u2019s privacy implications, adding that it could also be used for monitoring people\u2019s activities, including those online.\n\nThe Czech police have defended the use of the system referring to Section 66a of the Police Act which allows retroactive comparison of images with photographs from government sources such as ID records.\n\n\"The DPO system is used for comparing <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/?posttype=all&amp;s=retrospective\">retrospectively</a> ad hoc faces from specific serious cases and for identifying dead people of unknown identity,\" police spokesperson Jakub Vin\u010d\u00e1lek <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/policie-nastroje-rozpoznavani-tvari-fotografie-obcani-statni-registr.A230720_193057_domaci_itimp\">clarified</a> for local outlet Idnes.cz in July.\n\nBut local lawyers are questioning whether the system is exceeding the police\u2019s legal authorities.\n\nIuRe attorney Jan Vobo\u0159il argues that the law only covers the use of images but not biometric identification. Other legal experts such as Ond\u0159ej Preuss say that the mass use of CCTV surveillance requires a new legal framework, even if the images are only used by the facial recognition system retroactively.

And if it\u2019s unchecked, I think it presents a threat to the stability of society,\u201d Bud told <em>Biometric Update</em> in an interview.\n\nSocial interactions and transactions occur remotely with ever-more frequency, and are only possible given a sufficient amount of trust. Recent developments in AI threaten that trust.\n\n\u201cIn the end this is going to come down to biometrics and trust in biometrics,\u201d Bud says.\n\nTrust in biometrics comes from liveness assurance, which includes presentation attack detection (PAD), but also the ability to defend against injection attacks, which Bud calls \u201cthe real threat.\u201d It was Bud who revealed last October that injection attacks are <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202210/digital-injection-6x-more-frequent-than-biometric-presentation-attacks\">already more common</a> than presentation attacks.\n\nThe challenge with deepfakes is that they can be used to attack video selfie systems that are relatively resilient against traditional presentation attacks, via injection with camera emulators.\n\n\u201cMost industry players who claim to defend against deepfakes today actually rely upon stopping it at the source, upon detecting it in the device,\u201d according to Bud.\n\nThis is insufficient, he says, because the relatively primitive injection attacks seen until recently could be spotted by legacy technology and by people. Generative AI gets ten times harder every year, Bud estimates, and iProov has observed successful attacks that evaded on-device detection methods by \u201cendpoints that look like mobile devices but aren\u2019t.\u201d\n<h2>\u201cA fundamentally different approach\u201d</h2>\nInjection attacks and generative AI represent \u201ca different kind of problem from the liveness problem, the presentation attack problem,\u201d Bud says.\n\nThese attacks must be detected \u201cin the cloud, based on information in the biometrics, and to do so in a dynamic and continually adaptive way.\u201d\n\nBut what technology is capable of identifying these attacks?\n\n\u201cYou need a fundamentally different approach to solving a moving-target problem like that than\u00a0 a stationary target problem like good old presentation attacks,\u201d Bud says.\n\nThat approach is based on continuous monitoring and adaptation, more like the dominant paradigm in the broader cybersecurity space.\n\nBud argues that \u201calmost nobody apart from iProov actually has any visibility of real attacks.\u201d He attributes this advantage to the combination of cloud processing and the company\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202009/iproov-facility-secures-biometric-assurance-tech-manages-threats-from-cyber-attacks\">Security Operations Centre</a>, launched in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe and we alone process every liveness transaction in the cloud, and monitor and manage them through active threat intelligence,\u201d Bud states. \u201cWe\u2019re the only operators in the world with a biometric security operations center. We\u2019re the only company that analyzes every transaction attempt done anywhere in the world on any of our customers to look for signals of attack and novel mode attacks.\u201d\n\nBuilding the system, which \u201ccaptures everything in the world,\u201d was difficult and expensive, Bud says, perhaps explaining why the move has not been replicated.\n\nVendors who sell software to run on-premises have \u201cno visibility whatsoever of the evolving scenario,\u201d Bud argues. \u201cThere is no knowledge of when and how exploits are being found, and there is absolutely no mechanism for feeding back information about those exploits into adaptations in the software.\u201d Further, he believes software sold to run on-prem inevitably makes its way into attackers\u2019 hands.\n\nHe refers to those kinds of biometric solutions as \u201czero-day exploit machines.\u201d\n\nAnalysis of attacks in the wild is used to inform the evolution of iProov\u2019s systems and technology, according to Bud.\n\n\u201cOnly a system that does this can be trusted, because in the world of generative AI, we\u2019re up against immense resources available to the attackers \u2013 many of them are nation states \u2013 with world-class skills and technology.\u201d\n\nThe volume of monitoring iProov carries out gives it \u201can informational advantage\u201d or \u201cinformation asymmetry,\u201d Bud says. \u201cEvery time they attack us, we learn more about them then they learn about us. We see everything about their attack.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line for Bud is that the common perception of technologies as \u201cthe vulnerable and the invulnerable\u201d is \u201ccompletely untrue.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question is: How does the system respond to those exploits?\u201d he explains.\n<h2>Fraud risk and modality</h2>\nBud pushes back against another common perception about biometrics, arguing that credential compromise consists of something secret becoming public.\n\n\u201cNo biometric should be considered secret\u201d he says. Biometric security does not depend on secrecy, just genuineness. Therefore all biometric security depends on the ability to detect forgery, he reasons. Those who provide that security have to find buried signals of falseness within data.\n\nThis gives face an inherent advantage over other biometric modalities, Bud says.\n\nHis explanation draws on time spent in voice communications prior to founding iProov.\n\nFacial images have megabytes of data, while voice is transmitted using the GSM half rate codec, which is 12.5 kbps. Stakeholders can only demand more data by excluding those with low-bandwidth handsets or low-bandwidth networks.\n\nThat rate was chosen \u201cbased on modelling of human vocal tract,\u201d and according to Bud, \u201cgenerative AI doesn\u2019t struggle much with simulating that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fundamental problem you\u2019ve got is that is not enough to find the increasingly weak signals of falseness,\u201d due to increasing generative AI capabilities, Bud explains.\n\nSecurity will increasingly have to rely on one-time biometrics, he asserts.\n\nAnd effective, adaptable, responsive, actively threat-monitored liveness is fundamental to sustaining trust in the context of rapidly developing generative AI.\n<h2>Assessing process, rather than tech</h2>\nThis also makes assessment becomes a different kind of challenge.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing at the moment is: the only way in which you as a buyer can trust that you are buying a reliable liveness solution that is robust against injection attacks is to look at who has already reviewed and tested and bought the technology who has the resources themselves to independently test it.\u201d\n\nBud gives the U.S. federal government as an example. iProov went through a 3-month \u201cfederal intelligence contractor red team exercise\u201d while being considered as a <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202303/iproov-awarded-nearly-750k-by-dhs-st-in-fifth-phase-funding\">federal technology supplier</a>. A team of 8 people were dedicated to assessing iProov\u2019s vulnerability to deepfakes during this process, Bud says.\n\nPrivate companies can\u2019t afford to do that in most cases, though ING, iProov\u2019s first customer, hired \u201cnational security level pentester\u201d <a href=\"https://outflank.nl/\">Outflank</a> to test its liveness for 2 months as well.\n\nThese assessments, according to Bud, allow customers to answer the critical question: \u201cWhat is the vendor doing to detect, respond to and resist such attacks?\u201d\n\nThere is no certification or standard yet established for this kind of defense. Bud says customers are starting to recognize that they need to be able to answer that question, rather than possess a certain technology.\n\n\u201cCybersecurity certifications in general don\u2019t look at the particular technology, they look at the business system that assures resilience,\u201d Bud points out. \u201cI think that\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to go.\u201d\n\nUltimately, he sees biometric liveness as a bedrock for societal trust, so long as it is robust against changing threats. \u201cIt needs to be a business system sized and calibrated to the dynamic nature and the scale of the threat.\u201d\n\nHe believes no iProov competitor has the kind of one-time biometrics and active threat intelligence it has, but more importantly, that customer need to look beyond the marketing when choosing a vendor for biometric security.\n\nHe says the narrative of stopping injection attacks at the source is \u201cpernicious,\u201d and even puts systems at risk of being used for money laundering by sanctioned regimes looking to fund weapons programs.\n\nThis kind of threat removes the problem from the domain of confidence, where compliance theatre can suffice, Bud says. He urges stakeholders to \u201cplease take the problem seriously.\u201d", "link": "https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/align-liveness-detection-with-cybersecurity-best-practices-to-stop-generative-ai", "date_published": "2023-08-14T16:46:26+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/biometricupdate", "title": "Romance fraud \u2013 the anti-love story", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"1366\" src=\"https://d1sr9z1pdl3mb7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/14115948/online-dating-fraud-scaled.jpg\" width=\"2048\" />\n\t\t<em>By Simon Horswell, Fraud Specialist, <a href=\"https://onfido.com/\">Onfido</a></em>\n\nIn 1995, the world\u2019s first online dating site launched as Match.com, marking a new era for dating. Online dating meant that lonely hearts could connect with potential matches from the comfort of their own home. This convenience leant itself to fast user adoption, and today the dating app market is hugely successful, projected to generate almost <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/eservices/dating-services/online-dating/worldwide\">$3.01 billion in revenue in 2023</a>.\n\nBut new technology often has risks attached. Who is to say the potential match they\u2019re connecting with is who they say they are? This is not a theoretical concern. Analysis suggests that romance scammers exploit<a href=\"https://www.tsb.co.uk/news-releases/romance-scammers-break-over-60-hearts-and-wallets-every-week/\"> over 60 UK singles weekly</a> to commit financial crimes. In fact, a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-wiltshire-65842741\">romance fraudster</a>\u201d was recently jailed for five years for defrauding people via online dating platforms. If digital matchmaking platforms lack the means to protect their users from, the loss of trust could threaten their reputation and their future.\n\nPublic awareness of identity fraud has risen thanks to the popularity of true crime depictions, such as the Netflix\u2019s <em>Inventing Anna </em>and <em>The Tinder Swindler</em>. In the UK, these shows have increased consumers\u2019 awareness of their digital footprint, with <a href=\"https://onfido.com/press-release/rise-of-fraud-in-popular-culture-changes-consumer-outlook/\">over half (55 percent)</a> saying they are now more cautious online -- but digital dating services cannot afford to rest easy. As fraudsters expand the range of tactics they deploy, the popularization of fraud on our screens may be desensitizing many to the severity of its impact. So much so that almost one-in-five (17 percent) UK consumers are confident they would not fall victim to identity fraud, taking an \u201cit would never happen to me\u201d mentality.\n\nThe longevity of digital matchmaking rests upon online platforms keeping their users safe \u2013 and this starts with putting identity at the forefront of the experience. As the digital landscape grows in complexity and fraudsters try innovative new ways to scam and scale their operations, trusted apps and services are defined by how they approach security. Those searching for a blueprint can start by re-evaluating their Know Your Customer (KYC) process that establishes user\u2019s identities and assess any associated risk.\n<ol>\n \t<li>\n<h3>A KYC approach to online safety</h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nIdentity verification is at the heart of KYC innovation; it supports businesses to ensure the real identity of new users. With KYC frameworks, companies can accurately check account sign-ups, authenticate users, and check against watchlists for associated risks. However, the online dating industry operates without any form of KYC requirement. Identity verification is often decentralized in the industry, meaning it is left to the discretion of each organization or dating app.\n\nMatchmakers can leverage the benefits of KYC to their competitive advantage, emulating its adoption in other markets such as fintech and gaming. These industries automate KYC checks that allow them to onboard and verify new customers and detect fraud while reducing operational costs.\n\nUnlike fintech and gaming, dating apps are not legally required to perform KYC checks. However, for some, it\u2019s about building trust with users and keeping them safe. Matrimony site, <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202202/biometrics-bring-security-for-dating-matrimony-and-betting\">Jeevansathi</a>, set an industry precedent in adopting KYC and implementing user identity verification to build a trusted service with a streamlined user onboarding process. Digital-first apps like <a href=\"https://cherry.codeleap.co.uk/\">Cherry</a> have also introduced automated document and biometrics checks to increase safety and speed up user verification.\n<ol start=\"2\">\n \t<li>\n<h3>Mitigating romance scams / Fortified security without adding friction</h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nThe increasing popularity of dating apps opens up new avenues for fraudsters, who often like to hide where there are high volumes. This greater opportunity leads directly to a wider variety of attacks such as impersonation, catfishing, and coercion.\n\nIt\u2019s not just dating platforms making changes to address this. Social media giants such as Twitter and Meta\u2019s Facebook have adapted, although some of them learned the hard way. Last year, Twitter set the blueprint of what not to do, when fraudsters seized the opportunity to pay just $8 for Twitter Blue verification and impersonate public figures and global brands, costing companies billions.\n\nIn practice, solving this issue requires businesses to monitor a range of \u2018signals\u2019 to build trust that a user is legitimate -- like device IP, phone number and information from credit databases. But this business-critical information attracts fraudsters too, who expose it through mass data breaches and then sell it on the dark web. This makes layering identity processes crucial to mitigating risk.\n\nFor digital matchmakers, proving a connection between a person\u2019s ID and their physical biometrics helps build trust in users\u2019 real identity. Best practice prescribes that document verification should be deployed as the first line of defense. This can weed out amateur fraudsters, who often leave easily identifiable mistakes. As a second layer, biometric verification can help online businesses mitigate against stolen IDs and deter fraudsters who do not want to put their face to a name. Onfido found that the rate of identity fraud can drop by an average of 3.5x when businesses take this layered approach to identity authentication.\n<ol start=\"3\">\n \t<li>\n<h3>Understanding the biometric advantage</h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nDigital services nurture trust with their customers by prioritizing security, speed and convenience. These all underpin the modern online experience and can provide a competitive edge, boosting user acquisition and loyalty.\n\nIn recent years, biometrics has emerged at the heart of this competitive advantage. Today, as many as <a href=\"https://onfido.com/press-release/rise-of-fraud-in-popular-culture-changes-consumer-outlook/\">43 percent of consumers</a> indicate biometrics is their preferred approach to identity verification. While of those who have previously used a combination of ID checks and biometrics to authenticate themselves, a staggering <a href=\"https://onfido.com/resources/press-releases/onfido-survey-reveals-businesses-must-establish-trust-online-in-less-than-10-minutes\">(91 percent)</a> would do so again. Biometrics offers a visual representation of security, providing reassurance to users not only that businesses have invested in their safety, but that interactions are legitimate and individuals are authenticated.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, our 2023 Identity Fraud Report revealed that there are <a href=\"https://onfido.com/landing/identity-fraud-report/\">80 percent fewer attacks when faced with a biometric check</a>, as opposed to document verification alone. With fewer fraudsters able to access dating apps and online platforms, these businesses can protect their reputation, grow their user base and provide the peace of mind and confidence that connections are legitimate.\n<h2>Placing identity at the heart of matchmaking</h2>\nWith identity fraud rates still above pre-pandemic levels, digital dating apps must establish new processes to protect their users and verify that individuals are who they say they are. Under the influence of TV documentaries like The Tinder Swindler, consumers have become more aware of the risks, putting the onus on businesses to build trust and brand reputation but protecting users.\n\nThat\u2019s why online businesses must take a proactive approach to protect the hearts -- and finances -- of customers. By integrating KYC and taking advantage of automation and biometrics, dating apps can provide a seamless user experience, improve fraud prevention and build trust in digital matchmaking, so users can concentrate on their next connection -- not their next nightmare.\n<h2>About the author</h2>\nSimon Horswell is a Fraud Specialist Manager at <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/onfido\">Onfido</a>.\n\n<em>DISCLAIMER: Biometric Update\u2019s Industry Insights are submitted content.
