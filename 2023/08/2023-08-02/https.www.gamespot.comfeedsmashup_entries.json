And while I have gleefully partaken in nearly all of these festivities, I have found myself longing for something a bit different--something that pushes combat aside in favor of allowing me to explore a world filled with critters and characters <em>not </em>actively looking to fight me. Fortunately, Palia exists.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">An upcoming, free-to-play MMO focused on creativity and coziness rather than combat, Palia is a joy to play. The game eschews the more dreaded hallmarks of its genre--overt fetch quests and inconsequential stories and characters, to name a few--to create something more engaging than many MMOs yet larger scale than many farming sims. With dazzling cutscenes, characters you actually want to get to know (and perhaps even date), and satisfying gameplay abundant in things to do, Palia--even in its beta state--shows a lot of promise and packs in a ton of joy.</p><figure style=\"width: 1920px;\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4172929-palia-mediakit-kilimavillage.png\"><img alt=\"An overview of Kilima Village.\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1639/16394322/4172929-palia-mediakit-kilimavillage.jpg\" /></a><figcaption>An overview of Kilima Village.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">After making my avatar in the game's character creator--which surprised me with its breadth of different hair textures and darker skin tones, as well as its commitment to not gendering its two body types--the game kicks off with you emerging from a cloud of purple ether into the world of Palia.

And if you\u2019re looking for a way to bring a piece of Valisthea into your home, you\u2019ll be glad to know that a massive lineup of Final Fantasy XVI Bring Arts Kai action figures is now available for preorder. If you\u2019re feeling nostalgic, you\u2019ll also find a handful of figurines from other Final Fantasy games up for grabs.</p><p>Arguably most compelling item in the catalog is the <span class=\"norewrite\">           <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Square-Enix-Final-Fantasy-XVI/dp/B0CCSWNHNY?tag=gamespot-promos-20\">Clive Rosfield</a> </span> action figure, which stands around nine inches tall and is built with several points of articulation so you can customize his stance. You\u2019ll even find a set of interchangeable hands and a figure stand, allowing you to easily display the figurine once you\u2019ve settled on a good pose.</p><p>For long-time Final Fantasy fans, both <span class=\"norewrite\">           <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Square-Enix-Final-Fantasy-Action/dp/B0CCSX86LX?tag=gamespot-promos-20\">Tidus</a> </span> and <span class=\"norewrite\">           <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Square-Enix-Final-Fantasy-Action/dp/B0CCSWD4PW?tag=gamespot-promos-20\">Yuna</a> </span> action figures are available for preorder. The Final Fantasy 10 icons are highly detailed and articulated, with Tidus featuring his iconic sword, Brotherhood, along with a Blitzball, and Yuna featuring additional sleeve parts and her Magistral Rod.</p><p>Most of these figurines are rather expensive, but seeing as these are Square Enix imports crafted to high standards, you\u2019ll be getting what you pay for. What\u2019s more unfortunate is the release date--most figurines don't arrive until 2024.</p><p>While their launch is still a long way off, it doesn't hurt to get your preorder in today. Merchandise related to Final Fantasy is always a hot commodity, and there\u2019s no telling how much longer you\u2019ll have to wait if you don\u2019t secure a preorder ahead of release.</p><p>Here\u2019s a closer look at all the Final Fantasy figures up for preorder, including their price and anticipated release date.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Final Fantasy XVI: Clive Rosfield</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1702/17023653/4172724-finalfantasyxvicliverosfield.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p><strong>$130 - September 25, 2024</strong></p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Square-Enix-Final-Fantasy-XVI/dp/B0CCSWNHNY?tag=gamespot-promos-20\">Preorder at Amazon</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Final Fantasy X: Tidus</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1702/17023653/4172725-tidus.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p><strong>$195 - October 23, 2024</strong></p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Square-Enix-Final-Fantasy-Action/dp/B0CCSX86LX?tag=gamespot-promos-20\">Preorder at Amazon</a> </div></div><p> </p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Final Fantasy X: Yuna</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1702/17023653/4172726-yuna.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p><strong>$195 - November 20, 2024</strong></p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Square-Enix-Final-Fantasy-Action/dp/B0CCSWD4PW?tag=gamespot-promos-20\">Preorder at Amazon</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Square Enix Final Fantasy XVI: Clive Rosfield &amp;

Once you're ready to explore X-Isle, you'll be tasked with collecting five valuable glyphs from across the island alongside your fellow players who are known as Renegades. These locations are guarded by dangerous monsters and using these glyphs will unlock a treasury full of loot that you can turn in for rewards, if you can survive the extraction process.</p><p>You'll be able to equip up to two weapons--which are available in three quality levels--powerful items can be found scattered across X-Isle, and some treasure can be claimed by solving puzzles. While there's no shortage of monsters and beasts to watch out for on this island, the real danger here are the roving squads of Renegades who are looking to steal your loot from you. Death isn't the end as you can be revived at designated checkpoints by your teammates, but you'll be brought back to life without any loot, weapons, or items on you.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ahead-of-open-beta-heres-a-deeper-look-at-fortnite-like-shooter-hawked/1100-6516434/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ahead-of-open-beta-heres-a-deeper-look-at-fortnite-like-shooter-hawked/1100-6516434/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-08-02T13:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "HAWKED Deep Dive", "description": "<img height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1823/18237460/4171954-gameplaydeepdive_en.jpeg\" width=\"480\" /> HAWKED is a free online PvPvE extraction shooter that\u2019s entering Open Beta on August 3rd.

As the studio <a href=\"https://twitter.com/baldursgate3/status/1686473840690343936\">explained in a tweet</a>, this absence is due to a limitation on Steam's side that disallows pre-loading for games with an early access release.</p><p>As Larian explains, switching to pre-load ahead of the game's release would break the game for anyone still playing in early access. For what it's worth, early access players won't have it any easier when it comes to downloading the full game, as they have <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-early-access-saves-and-the-game-itself-should-be-deleted-ahead-of-launch/1100-6516449/\">been instructed to</a> to delete all saves and mods, and uninstall the game before the full version releases.
