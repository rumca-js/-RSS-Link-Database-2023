GOOD FOR YOU. It's the equivalent of making a reference to doing drugs, or screaming \"SEX... now that I have your attention.\"<br /></p><p>And when she says \"Jason Aldean\" vibes she means...what? The vibes of <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jason-aldean-instagram-kids-shirt\" target=\"_blank\">being a dedicated father and husband</a>? I'm not entirely sure who P!nk's audience is these days, but I'm assuming it's young girls and someone giving off a vibe that he loves his family should be a good thing. I know it is out in small towns. Maybe not the cities P!nk performs in.</p><p>What the artist most likely means is the vibe of someone who has political opinions they disagree with. To the Left, that's the worst vibe you can give off. P!nk has always been an outspoken progressive. She no doubt supported the Democrat party-endorsed riots of a few years ago. I'm sure she donated to the <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/was-the-minnesota-freedom-fund-just-exposed-for-being-a-fraud\" target=\"_blank\">Minnesota Freedom Fund</a>. And it would not surprise me if she campaigned for and helped elect the Democrat elected officials whose policies have encouraged the increased crime in those Democrat-run cities.</p><p>Poor Jason Aldean. Things were finally turning around. He has the #1 song in America and he could finally put this national nightmare behind him. Now, he has to carry the burden of upsetting P!nk.

We live in the parts of real America where people can disagree with each other and live in harmony. As opposed to progressive America, where if you're every worldview isn't affirmed, someone needs to be destroyed. This is not to say <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kelsea-balerini-cmt-awards\" target=\"_blank\">there aren't</a> some <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/maren-morris-sobs-ru-paul\" target=\"_blank\">insufferable examples</a>.

Fans showed what happens when you try that in a small town. To quote Brittney Aldean, <a href=\"https://www.whiskeyriff.com/2023/08/01/brittany-aldean-celebrates-after-jason-aldeans-try-that-in-a-small-town-hits-1-on-hot-100-chart-that-sure-did-backfire/\" target=\"_blank\">that sure did backfire</a>.</p><p>Morgan Wallen was drunk one night and dropped a \"soft G\" with friends. The Left attempted to cancel him from ever appearing on television again, but <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/morgan-wallen-sean-combs-billboard\" target=\"_blank\">even P. Diddy called it BS</a>: \"Morgan [used the N-word] while talking to his boy. People make mistakes. Now we\u2019re moving on with love and respect for everybody that was hurt or affected. It\u2019s time to forgive.\"</p><p>Wallen's single has grown so huge, \"Last Night\" is even played on New York City radio where you'd think he'd be canceled over having a funny accent by closed-minded and intolerant NYers.  The personal irony for me as a NY country music fan is he's my least favorite of his crew. I dig him, but Ernest, Jelly Roll, and Hardy all rank ahead.</p><p>The Luke Combs \"controversy\" is the dumbest one of all of them. He covered Tracy Chapman's \"Fast Car.\" It was one of the top songs of the late 80s from one of the top artists of the late 80s. Chapman is both black and gay, so, of course, the journalisming content creators at Washington Post felt it necessary <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/washington-post-tracy-chapman\" target=\"_blank\">to try and create racism and homophobia where none existed</a>, claiming Chapman would have an almost zero chance at that achievement herself.</p><blockquote>\"Fast Car\" by Tracy Chapman was nominated for 3 Grammy Awards including Record of the Year and Song of the Year. She won for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Best New Artist. She has 7 other nominations for Grammy Awards and two wins.</blockquote><p>And it needs to be pointed out with the exception of Aldean, neither Wallen nor Combs do anything political in the slightest. Even with Aldean, prior to \"Small Town\" the most he's done was golf with Trump once and defend his wife against media attacks. Americans just want to enjoy good music. The side that doesn't want to let them keeps losing.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

In 2016 that meant <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/republican-elector-anti-trumpers-come-bro\" target=\"_blank\">threatening electors</a>, threatening to <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/electoral-college-voter-burn-alive\" target=\"_blank\">burn their families alive</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/finally-celebrities-shoot-video-calling-electors-block-trump\" target=\"_blank\">enlisting celebrities to encourage electors to overturn</a> the will of the people.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LWCnewswire/status/1686688616368525312\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>2. The timing.</strong></p><p>This is the third time Trump indictments were dropped the day after there were stories about Biden family corruption between Joe <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/cnn-biden\" target=\"_blank\">and his scumbag son</a>. Once is a coincidence. Three times... you would think the DOJ would wait a few days to NOT make it look this obvious. The Biden Adminstration doesn't care and knows they can count on corporate media to carry whatever water is necessary.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/greg_price11/status/1686492127042113536\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>3. Jack Smith, the prosecutor, has straight up said Trump is guilty until proven innocent.</strong></p><p>During his press conference, Smith went on a rant demagoguing Donald Trump, calling him the mastermind behind the darkest day in American history, and promising to take down this evil monster once and for all. <a href=\"https://redstate.com/jenvanlaar/2023/08/01/prosecutor-jack-smith-gives-demagoguic-statement-on-latest-trump-indictment-n786008\" target=\"_blank\">Oh, by the way</a>...</p><blockquote>In the meantime I must emphasize that the indictment is only an allegation and that the defendant must be presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</blockquote><p><strong>4. The Obama-appointed judge who will oversee the trial LOVES throwing people in jail for J6.</strong></p><p>Judge Tanya Chutkan has been picked to oversee the trial. The Left loves her so much she was featured in <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12363639/DC-judge-oversee-Trumps-criminal-case-toughest-punisher-Jan-6-rioters-worked-law-firm-associated-Hunter-Biden.html\" target=\"_blank\">content created by the Associated Press</a>: <em>\"Chutkan has handed out tougher sentences than the [Justice Department] was seeking in seven cases, matched its requests in four others, and sent all 11 riot defendants who have come before her behind bars.\"</em></p><p>There were four cases where prosecutors didn't seek jail time, but Chutkan locked them up anyway.</p><p>Not only will Trump NOT come before a jury of his peers -- Washington DC is 90% Democrat -- but the judge is a bitter partisan who looks for an excuse to toss opponents behind bars.</p><p><strong>5. A Jack Smith conviction has already been UNANIMOUSLY overturned by the Supreme Court.</strong></p><p>Former Virginia governor Bob McDonnell, a Republican and a rising star in the party, was convicted in 2014 of violating federal bribery law. The Supreme Court in 2016 <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/feds-to-drop-charges-against-former-va-gov-bob-mcdonnell\" target=\"_blank\">ruled UNANIMOUSLY that no laws were broken</a>. Unanimously, even Ruth Bader Ginsberg.</p><p>Smith also went after Democrat Senator Bob Menendez in 2015 on bribery charges. <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/ex-virginia-gov-who-saw-conviction-by-jack-smith-thrown-out-says-hed-rather-win-than-get-it-right\" target=\"_blank\">It was declared a mistrial in 2017</a>.</p><p>Jack Smith likes to chase headlines. This is the first time he has done so to actively interfere with an election.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.
