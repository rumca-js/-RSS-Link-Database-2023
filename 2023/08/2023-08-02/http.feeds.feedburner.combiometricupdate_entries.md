		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/worldcoin">Worldcoin</a>, which says it wants to build a “more human internet” with its <a href="https://worldcoin.org/world-id">World ID</a> credential and globular iris scanning device, has been told that the its plan is not welcome in Kenya until its biometric data collection practices have passed a legal assessment, according to <a href="https://www.africanews.com/2023/08/02/kenya-suspends-worldcoin-cryptocurrency-data-protection-probe/">Africa News</a>.

The country’s Ministry of Home Affairs announced it is suspending Worldcoin’s enrollments and cryptocurrency issuance while “the relevant government agencies certify the absence of any risk to the public.”

Worldcoin, which was founded by OpenAI’s Sam Altman, is <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/worldcoin-cryptocurrency-drives-digital-id-enrollment-despite-potential-privacy-nightmare">doling out free crypto</a> to anyone who undergoes an iris scan by staring into the eye of the Orb, its somewhat dystopian looking biometric capture and imaging device. In Kenya, tokens are worth approximately 7700 shillings, or around US$54 – no small amount when the national gross income per capita is around US$2,170. The offer has worked, with thousands of people showing out in the capital of Nairobi this week to trade their iris scans for crypto and a digital ID.

But concerns about Worldcoin’s commitment to privacy and the legality of its practices mean that, for now, anyone left holding a Worldcoin token will have to wait to cash it. Although the company’s parent, Tools for Humanity GmbH, is <a href="https://techcabal.com/2023/08/01/worldcoin-meets-legal-requirement-in-kenya/">registered</a> with the data commissioner as a data processor, and can legally collect private data from residents, privacy experts say there is no guarantee that it will do what it says with whatever data it collects. As well, there have been questions about the biometric security of the Orb, after <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/worldcoin-nears-100m-funding-round-amid-security-concerns">malware was found</a> on operators’ personal devices.

Despite such concerns, Worldcoin is forging ahead with its plan for global domination, aiming to deploy 1,500 Orbs around the world. As reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/worldcoin-says-will-allow-companies-governments-use-its-id-system-2023-08-02/">Reuters</a>, the company wants to build a massive financial and identity community that can be of use to organizations, businesses, and governments. Regional manager for Europe, Ricardo Macieira, says the infrastructure could provide a framework for universal basic income and “global democratic processes.” Or, on a smaller scale, cafes wanting to give away freebies while deterring people from taking multiples could scan their customers’ irises to make sure they take one coffee, and no more.

“The idea is that anyone can in the future build their own orb and use it to benefit the community that it's aiming for,” says Macieira, who confirmed that Worldcoin intends to continue expanding operations in <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/worldcoin-launches-digital-id-proof-of-personhood-in-germany">Europe</a>, Latin America and Africa, as well as “all the parts of the world that will accept us.”

Kenya joins regulators in the UK, France, Germany, and Mexico who have all <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/multiple-regulators-turn-gaze-to-worldcoins-iris-collection">launched investigations</a> into the legality and ethics of Worldcoin’s biometric capture and storage practices.

## India deploys fingerprint liveness detection to combat Aadhaar payment fraud

<img alt="" class="attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="543" src="https://d1sr9z1pdl3mb7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/25122233/aadhaar-authentication.jpg" width="960" />
		India's finance minister says custom-coded anti-spoofing software has been deployed, designed to prevent biometric fraud on the Aadhaar-enabled payment system.

AI code was created by the Unique Identity Authority of India, which has declined to provide <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/uidai-refuses-disclosure-on-liveness-project-as-indian-police-crack-down-on-cybercrime">development details</a>. It performs finger-minutiae and -image recording and detects liveness during Aadhaar authentication.

The code is a response to people creating silicone fingerprints to illegally siphon money from accounts.

In May, Airtel Payments Bank and the National Payments Corp. of India (NPCI) launched UIDAI-written a facial recognition authentication app for the Aadhaar transactions.

Meanwhile, Indian payments service firm Paytm is developing AI to enable payments through facial recognition, says Vijay Shekhar Sharma the company's founder, according to the <a href="https://www.deccanherald.com/business/business-news/paytm-working-on-payments-through-facial-recognition-1238782.html">Deccan Herald</a>.

Still, technology alone will not solve the problem, particularly when a business correspondent is the bad actor. Business correspondents are informal bank agents who have biometric point-of-sale machines.

After a customer gives access to their banking details and enrolls their biometrics, little prevents a correspondent can increase the amount of money and skim the difference. This works particularly well when customers don't get a receipt for the transaction.

According to India's Home Ministry, 694,000 financial crimes, such as money laundering and fraud, were reported in fiscal 2021-2022, up sharply from 262,000 the previous year, says <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/how-uidai-is-using-ai-to-tackle-payment-frauds-8871408/">Indian Express</a>.

Aadhaar is the basis of numerous biometric applications in India.

People registering for goods and service tax numbers in the Indian Union Territory of Puducherry should expect to be asked to perform a risk-based biometric Aadhaar authentication as part of a <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/aadhaar-biometrics-verification-for-gst-registration-pilot-in-india-to-expand">pilot program</a>.

		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/prembly">Prembly</a>, which bills itself as a leading compliance and security infrastructure provider in Africa, announced that it has acquired Tunnel, a secure data sharing company, in order to expand its presence in emerging markets.

Prembly's infrastructure combines document verification, face biometrics, liveness detection and other security and compliance tools to aid businesses in securely and quickly verifying users' identities. Its Identitypass software provides selfie biometrics and liveness for customer onboarding and compliance with KYC regulations. The newly acquired <a href="https://usetunnel.com/">Tunnel</a>, based in Nigeria, specializes in data analytics and infrastructure with an emphasis on secure business data sharing.

The move means that customers will have access to a wider range of APIs offering creditworthiness assessments, anti-fraud checks, and online user behavior insights. It will also allow businesses to scale more easily by giving them access to real-time customer information through a unified API.

This could be particularly useful for <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/namibias-financial-regulator-partners-with-prembly-on-digital-id-regulatory-sandbox">financial institutions</a> across the globe, as financial data can be fundamental in verifying identities, the statement from Prembly suggests. Tunnel allows clients to access and share data with lenders.

"This strategic move expands our financial data capabilities across emerging markets, enhancing our security and verification systems," says Prembly CEO, Lanre Ogungbe. "This acquisition empowers us to provide businesses with accurate and actionable credit data.”

“We are proud to join forces with Prembly as we integrate our solutions into an extensive compliance and security network. This acquisition marks a drive towards empowering businesses, particularly with actionable customer information and insights," says co-founder and CEO of Tunnel Tobi Okedeji in a statement.

## California tests, Iowa launches digital IDs, while Michigan considers legislation

<img alt="mDL mobile drivers license" class="attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="514" src="https://d1sr9z1pdl3mb7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/06115457/mDL-mobile-drivers-license.png" width="1024" />
		California, Michigan, and Iowa are all taking steps to implement digital IDs. California is testing, Iowa is launching, and Michigan is considering legislation related to mobile driver’s licenses.  These states are planning to join Arizona, Colorado, Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, Hawaii, Ohio, Utah, and Maryland in offering mDLs.

"New digital driver’s licenses will allow residents to virtually perform services that otherwise would have required an in-person trip to the DMV," says Ajay Amlani, President and head of Americas, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/iproov-limited">iProov</a> in a comment emailed to <em>Biometric Update</em>.

Michigan is proposing a bill that would allow the Secretary of State to issue digital IDs in addition to their traditional physical counterparts, according to a <a href="https://www.wzzm13.com/article/news/local/proposed-bill-would-create-electronic-ids-michigan/69-9a5825ba-2ae4-4e49-a6c5-4e55497a3328">local outlet</a>. If passed, mDLs would become official IDs, equivalent to physical licenses. They would be valid for state government services, banking, police stops, and ID checks for age.

Some raise concerns about whether an ID can be accessed on a lost or stolen phone. Others raise concerns that deepfakes and other cyberattacks can circumvent biometric authentication.

"Given the ease and accessibility of generative AI tools that can create fake images, it’s irresponsible for government or business entities to implement any system utilizing remote-based biometrics without the necessary protections against AI-created deepfakes digitally injected into vulnerable camera feeds," says Amlani.

California's DMV is testing a mobile app that allows residents to upload mDLs to their phones with iProov’s biometrics and liveness detection.

"Now, California residents will soon discover a mobile driver’s license is not only a more secure way to verify one’s identity without having to divulge significant amounts of personal information, but also a much more convenient option," says Amlani.

"To combat the combination of <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/4-in-10-businesses-have-already-seen-deepfakes-injection-attacks">deepfakes and digital injection attacks</a>, organizations need a science-based, multifaceted approach like the California DMV is employing that leverages the creation of a one-time biometric."

The program currently has over 2,000 active participants and is set to expand over the next few weeks before a public roll out, according to <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/dmv-in-testing-stages-of-mobile-drivers-licenses-for-californians/3197194/">NBC Los Angeles</a>. Participating California residents are still urged to carry their physical IDs, as mDLs are not universally accepted yet.

The TSA is now accepting mDLs at 29 airports in America, including several in California.

Iowa has also launched its mobile ID app developed by <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/idemia">Idemia</a> on the Apple App store and Google Play, The digital ID is "a companion to the physical card and does not replace it," <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/local/2023/08/01/iowas-mobile-identification-app-is-finally-out-how-does-it-work/70505308007/">according to Toni Smith</a>, a spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Transportation.

The app asks a user to upload the front and back of their state-issued ID along with a "moving selfie" to verify the identity of the user uploading the license with face biometrics.

		ByteDance faces a proposed class action for privacy practices in the U.S. that allegedly violate federal and state laws.

According to <a href="https://www.hbsslaw.com/sites/default/files/case-downloads/capcut-user-rights/2023-07-28-complaint.pdf">court documents</a> (case 1:23-cv-04953), ByteDance has collected personal data using CapCut since the app's 2020 U.S. debut. The app helps in making and posting videos.

The laws cited include the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, California's Comprehensive Data Access and Fraud Act and Illinois' <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/bipa-might-be-changing-but-not-soon-enough-for-some-class-action-defendants">Biometric Information</a> <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/historic-penalty-decision-in-bipa-case-shows-the-need-to-take-biometric-privacy-seriously">Privacy Act</a>. The plaintiffs also claim ByteDance has violated California's constitutional right of privacy.

China-based social media company ByteDance is accused in federal district court in the northern district of Illinois of illegally collecting subscribers' personally identifiable information through its CapCut app.

Data harvesting, storage and dissemination through CapCut continues, according to the plaintiffs, Evelia Rodriguez, Erikka Wilson and an unnamed child.

The suit states that CapCut has grown very popular, with 400 million downloads around the world in 2022. It reportedly has 200 million monthly active users.

The even more popular <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202208/angry-tiktok-biometric-data-privacy-suit-has-an-angry-afterlife">TikTok has already settled</a> a biometric data privacy suit in the U.S. for $92 million.

## Hills and valleys for global ID registration and digital transformation

		The global boom in digital IDs has picked up speed in some countries, while others face delays and a falloff in enrolment.

In Sierra Leone, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/x-infotech">X Infotech</a> has deployed its modular system for document registry, calling it “a turnkey solution for national and non-national eID and <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/ecowas">ECOWAS</a> card issuance.” In a release, the company says the digital ID will help streamline government processes, improve the accuracy and security of citizens’ personal data, and provide a more efficient and secure way to access services.

“We look forward to continue our work in Sierra Leone with (partners) Constrat Systems Ltd. and NCRA and will fully support the digitalization efforts of the government,” says Sergey Yeliseyev, Business Development Director for Government eID of X Infotech.

Biometrics and national <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202301/in-asia-ambitious-digital-id-targets-accompany-digitization">digital transformation</a> efforts in Vietnam hit a milestone recently, with Vietnam Plus <a href="https://en.vietnamplus.vn/over-422-million-eid-accounts-in-hanoi-activated/265287.vnp">reporting</a> that, as of June 28, 4.22 million of the more than 6 million e-ID accounts created in Hanoi have been activated.

According to the city’s Department of Information and Communications, the city is moving rapidly toward digitization, with local districts taking up tasks and more than 99 percent of city businesses submitting their tax declarations electronically.
<h2>ID registration slows in 2 African nations</h2>
Nigeria’s National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) says that registrations for National Identification Numbers (NIN) have dropped off the monthly average. A post from TechNext <a href="https://technext24.com/2023/08/01/nimc-issues-634603-nin-in-july/">reports</a> 634,603 registrations for the month of July, down significantly from May’s high of 1.3 million.

To date, 101.64 million NINs have been issued, with Lagos recording the highest number of enrolments at 11.07 million. Bayelsa, to the southeast of the capital, has the lowest, with 638,660 issuances.

The slowdown could put further pressure on Nigeria, which even at a million enrolments monthly was at risk of not meeting targets set by the World Bank’s <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202302/global-estimate-for-people-without-id-reduced-to-850m-id4d-report">Digital Identification for Development</a> (ID4D) project. ID4D wants 148 million Nigerians to have a NIN by June 2024. Of those, 65 million are expected to be women.

In Malawi, concern around costs and the timing of an election compelled the National Registration Bureau to put the brakes on its campaign to renew 4 million IDs. Expired ID cards will now be valid until January 2026, as the government prepares to register voters for the 2025 presidential contest. Registration for a new ID comes with a cost of K2,500, or about USD$2.50.

On the positive side, from having no ID system in 2017, Malawi has to date <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202212/malawis-biometric-id-approaches-total-coverage-huge-cost-savings">registered</a> 94 percent of its adult population.

## Battle over age verification heats up in increasingly censorious US

		Depending on the point of view, online life in the United States is either marching toward safety for children or sliding into unprecedented government and corporate trackability.

States and even the U.S. Congress are <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/finding-a-coherent-framework-for-age-verification-to-keep-kids-safe-online">pushing</a> <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/anti-porn-age-verification-for-minors-in-uk-and-us-attracts-data-protection-criticism">legislation</a> that tries to gate online pornography and social media for access only by people who can prove they are 18 years old or older.

To accomplish one goal, protecting children, swaths of the internet would require people to prove their legal adulthood and that, at least right now, means making biometrics or ID document scans available to unseen actors.

The Congress, which seems unwilling to address the internet unless legislation has a variation of the word "children" in the name, is <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2023/7/senate-commerce-committee-approves-11-bills-including-bipartisan-children-s-online-privacy-legislation">working</a> on the Children and Teens' Online Privacy Protection and the Kids Online Safety acts in the Senate.

The bills, referred to as COPPA 2.0 and KOSA, have been passed out of committee and are expected to be heard on the Senate floor next month.

Trade publication Bloomberg Law has compiled a <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/in-house-counsel/porn-site-age-checks-required-by-growing-number-of-states">growing list</a> of state legislatures that have passed online child protection laws. They include Virginia, Mississippi and Utah. Texas and Montana have passed laws and are waiting for them to be enacted.

Lawsuits are following some of the state's gating laws, often filed by privacy advocates and NetChoice, an exclusive trade group that includes X, TikTok, Meta, Google and Amazon, <a href="https://www.law360.com/cybersecurity-privacy/articles/1704663">according to</a> legal trade publication Law360.

For example, NetChoice in December filed for a preliminary injunction to sideline California's Age-Appropriate Design Code Act, which was passed last fall. The law goes beyond what its name implies to deal with access.

NetChoice has warned that it is the most comprehensive attack on the First Amendment in 25 years.

Last week, a federal judge told lawyers for NetChoice and the state attorney general she needed more information on the issue. The judge has said she feels like she is walking a fine line, that both sides have legitimate concerns.

Meanwhile, a legal challenge against Utah’s online age restrictions was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/08/01/porn-age-verification-lawsuit-dismissed-utah/c7a2c200-30cb-11ee-85dd-5c3c97d6acda_story.html">dismissed</a> this week.

Opposition to these laws beyond lawsuits and a few association boards has been muted by the marketing of legislation. Who are the voters (or even viewers of nude photos) who will raise a fist to stop laws with names like Kids Online Safety Act?

<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/07/25/influencers-starting-to-realize-how-the-kids-online-safety-act-kosa-will-do-real-damage/">They exist</a>, though. They see not just threats to free speech and expression but to the LGBTQ+ community whose very lives are pornographic to a vocal minority.

Adult content mecca Pornhub is taking an unusual path on the topic. It is working with Louisiana to implement age verification, but it cut access to its site in <a href="https://katv.com/news/local/pornhub-blocked-in-arkansas-after-new-state-law-requires-id-age-verification-act-612-senate-bill-66-tyler-dees-mindy-mcalindon-protection-of-minors-from-distribution-of-harmful-materials-pornography-porn-minors-issues-internet-hyper-sexualization-liable">Arkansas</a>, Virginia, Mississippi and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/08/01/porn-age-verification-lawsuit-dismissed-utah/c7a2c200-30cb-11ee-85dd-5c3c97d6acda_story.html">Utah</a>.

		As <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/digital-frauds-20-percent-rise-motivates-search-for-digital-identity-insights">cybercrime and ID fraud</a> rates continue to become more prevalent, IDnow and other digital ID companies including Vouched, AuthenticID, Veridas and SQR Group are demonstrating security through third-party certifications.
<h2><strong>IDnow gets PVID, ISO 27001 certification</strong></h2>
European digital identity proofing platform provider <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/idnow">IDnow Group</a> was approved by the National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (ANSSI) to receive the remote identity verification "PVID" certification on the "substantial" level for its identity proofing and e-signature services.

While eIDAS establishes European standards for security that meet the equivalence of face-to-face verification, PVID implements the same standard but for digital onboarding for financial services in France. This makes France the first country in the EU to have an established, effective policy for remote ID verification, the company argues. IDnow is the second private company to obtain the certification.

IDnow also received the ISO 27001 certification for all of its entities. The certification demonstrates that a business has an established information security management system that keeps data secure and manages risk, giving it particular value for companies handling biometrics and personally identifiable information. The certification "marks a significant milestone in our commitment to delivering the most secure identity verification solutions to our customers and partners," says Armin Bauer, IDnow co-founder and chief technology and security officer in a release.
<h2><strong>Vouched and AuthenticID receive ISO 27001 certifications </strong></h2>
<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/vouched">Vouched</a>, an AI-powered identity platform, announced it received the accreditation for the fourth consecutive year. The certification demonstrates the company's "unwavering commitment to maintaining the highest standards of security and compliance for our valued customers," says John Baird, co-founder and CEO of Vouched, in a company statement.

<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/authenticid">AuthenticID</a> has received the ISO 27001 certification for the sixth straight year, along with the SOC 2 Type II recertification. The company achieved "both complementary SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001's standards certification for three years running," demonstrating that "its business process has the tools and controls in place  to strengthen the organization across the three pillars of cyber security: people, processes and technology through independent third party audits,” comments Chris Borkenhagen, AuthenticID's ISO and Chief Digital Officer.
<h2><strong>Veridas face biometrics interface gets LenelS2 factory certification </strong></h2>
Spanish digital ID company <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/veridas">Veridas</a> has received the LenelS2 factory certification, which validates the functionality of the company's Facial Biometrics Access Control interface to the OnGuard access control system. The company also joined the LenelS2 OpenAccess Alliance Program, according to an announcement.

The access control system allowed visitors and employees to self-register remotely or at a reception desk by capturing their ID card and a photo of themselves. Once the system verifies a user's identity, it generates a non-transferable biometric access credential. The individual then presents their identity at the Veridas terminal, which can authenticate them in less than a second and then grant access.

“With remote enrollment and facial access, no human intervention or physical credentials are needed," says Eduardo Azanza, Veridas CEO. "We are thrilled with this strong alliance and look forward to seeing the breakthrough opportunities it provides to organizations.”

		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/vsblty">Vsblty</a>, a company focused on bringing biometrics to retail, is laying out its business plans for the years 2023 and 2024. The Vancouver-headquartered firm plans to expand the deployment of its retail analytics technology for security and theft prevention with real-time facial recognition.

Vsblty <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202301/us-retail-conference-draws-biometrics-for-payments-marketing-and-age-estimation">makes</a> digital displays integrated with cameras that detect and classify faces to deliver real-time targeted advertising. The displays are placed in stores and can identify both specific customers and types of customers based on demographics such as age and gender.

Its platform collects anonymized data about customers' behaviors, providing analytics to businesses on where their products are being purchased and who are their customers in real-time. The company says that the platform has increased sales by over 25 percent.

The company also sells security products that can recognize known offenders with live facial recognition and detect weapons, as well as track and report suspicious behavior in public spaces.

Its platform has been deployed and tested in over 10,000 security cameras in Mexico, with over 3,700 of those cameras installed in the Benito Juarez district of Mexico City. The deployment has resulted in a 48 percent reduction in high-impact crimes such as violent assaults, robberies, and burglaries and an increase in public perceptions of safety in the district, according to the company.

"Our AI-driven approach delivers quantifiable, real-world benefits in both retail environments and for crime prevention," says CEO of Vsblty Jay Hutton. "With our recent financing, we have the funds, the team, the experience and opportunities to create additional shareholder value as we further deploy systems for our clients through 2023 and 2024."

Vsblty has pulled in <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202211/retail-video-analytics-investment-defies-market-trend-with-vsblty-raise-march-acquisition">$3.9 million</a> in private placements by November 2022. In March, the company <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202303/new-ceos-named-by-authid-nec-america">made</a> digital media veteran <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/luizfelipe/">Luiz Barros</a> its new executive chairman.

The retail industry has been <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202301/us-retail-conference-draws-biometrics-for-payments-marketing-and-age-estimation">introducing more biometric technology</a> into stores. Aside from customer analytics, facial recognition is also being used to prevent shoplifting <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/facewatch-caught-in-more-controversy-after-closed-door-meeting-with-uk-home-office">despite mounting criticism</a> from civil rights groups and politicians. A r<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/bar-for-uk-crimes-prosecuted-with-live-facial-recognition-could-get-much-lower">ecent case study</a> from RecFaces shows that such systems can identify thieves and reduce theft-related losses by 50 percent.

## Israel issues draft guidelines on biometric data collection in the workplace

		Israel’s privacy watchdog has published a draft document outlining guidelines and rules organizations and businesses should keep in mind when using biometric systems to monitor employee attendance at the workplace.

The <em>Collection and Use of Biometric Data at the Workplace </em><a href="https://www.gov.il/he/departments/publications/Call_for_bids/biometrid_data_workplace">policy paper</a> was published by the Israeli Privacy Protection Authority (PPA) in July as a response to increasing privacy concerns about biometric identification technology used for access control and supervising work hours. The public can submit their comments on the draft until August 18.

Among some of the key points of the document is the need for employers to justify the proportionality of using biometric systems and balancing legitimate interests against employee privacy. The collection of biometric data must be based on free informed consent.

The agency also provides a ranking of preferred alternatives for managing employee attendance. In regards to biometrics, the documents recommend that data is stored in a decentralized way, for example on smart cards, instead of a centralized database owned by the employer.

Employers using biometric attendance systems should register a database with the Privacy Protection Authority and need to provide sufficient details, including purposes, name of the individual in charge, where data is stored, security measures, potential risks, employee access and rectification rights, retention, how data can be removed from the database and third party recipients.

The document also outlines other procedures for handling biometric data, such as data minimization. Employers are expected to use databases only for the specific purpose for which it was collected and delete any biometric data that is no longer required, such as those from employees who have quit or have retired.

The draft policy paper is an update to the Israeli Privacy Protection Authority previous paper from 2012.

Data privacy, particularly relating to biometrics, has been a recurring issue in Israel, between a <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202207/israeli-court-rejects-call-to-delete-governments-biometric-database-leaves-room-for-appeal">massive government database</a> of citizens’ faces and fingerprints and the suggestion late last year by the state comptroller that the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202212/israel-defense-criticized-over-26-year-old-privacy-protocols-for-biometric-data">IDF’s privacy protocols</a> are obsolete.

## Russia bans foreign online ID verification systems

		Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a package of laws further regulating the country’s online sphere, including a ban on user registrations with foreign e-mail addresses or ID services by Gmail or Apple in favor of domestic digital ID players.

The move has caused an uproar in the Russian IT industry which says that the regulation will affect verification for online financial services. And local digital rights activists <a href="https://roskomsvoboda.org/post/zakony-protiv-ineta-2023/">see it as another step</a> towards isolating the Russian internet.

People wanting to register on Russian platforms have limited digital ID options. They can use the government services platform, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202212/russian-lawmakers-okay-legal-framework-for-biometric-data-collection-and-processing">Gosuslugi</a>, and the government's Unified Identification and Authentication System (<a href="https://ict.moscow/en/card/esia/">ESIA)</a>, which is connected to the federal remote biometric identification platform <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/unified-biometrics-system">Unified Biometric System</a>. They can also register using a domestic phone number or use Russia-based internet service firms such as Yandex.

"We believe that the ID of Russian users should be tied to a Russian phone number, e-mail in .ru and .rf domains, Gosuslugi or biometrics," Anton Gorelkin, deputy of the State Duma's Information Policy Committee and author of the amendment, <a href="https://lenta.ru/news/2023/07/25/registratsiya/">told</a> local media last week.

Gorelkin claimed the move will prevent data leaks and thefts. The changes are effective December 1 as part of <a href="http://publication.pravo.gov.ru/document/0001202307310022?pageSize=100&amp;index=1">amendments</a> to two federal laws regulating online information. It will affect only sites that require registration and authentication and will not be retroactive.

Critics, however, say that none of the four authorization methods provide a convenient experience for users of online financial services without meaningful risk reduction. The move to the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202210/russia-to-establish-center-for-biometric-technologies-to-operate-national-database">ESIA</a> system could also strain its infrastructure as it will have to handle millions of authorization requests daily, including accessing internet banking and online wallets.

“And failures in this infrastructure will actually mean the inability to access remote service channels, which will have an extremely negative impact on confidence in the financial sector,” Victor Dostov, president of the Russian E-Money and Remittance Association <a href="https://www.forbes.ru/tekhnologii/493439-novye-pravila-registracii-v-internete-ugrozaut-prilozeniam-bankov-i-apple-id">told</a> Forbes' Russian-language service.

<a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/technologies/innovation_policy/articles/2023/07/19/986118-net-predela-sovershenstvu">According</a> to its proponents, the ESIA platform coupled with biometric identification could turn into a digital ID service that can be used in the financial industry for remote client verification while Gosuslugi could provide data on Russian citizens in real-time. In the future, ESIA could also be used for opening online wallets for the digital ruble which <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/russia-launch-digital-ruble-cbdc-102241529.html">started trials</a> this August.

The Russian government has been making significant investments in Gosuslugi and ESIA, <a href="https://telesputnik.ru/materials/gov/news/rostelekom-i-mincifry-zaklyucili-kontrakt-na-600-mln-rub-na-razvitie-gosuslug-i-esia">signing</a> a 2.2 billion rubles ($23.5 million) contract with state telecommunications giant Rostelecom for their development in March and an additional 600 million rubles ($6.4 million) contract in April.

<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/social-media-will-soon-require-id-verification-in-vietnam">Vietnam</a> has similarly moved to restrict online freedom with identity verification.
