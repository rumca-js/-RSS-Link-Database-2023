This day was Chaotic to say the least. We had so much setting up and looking for tools to do so we only managed to do three out of five turning operations, we´ll finish up the work on the lathe with the last two operations later this week. 

The prototype is designed to answer the age old question: Can I play tight music using a very strong flywheel? The new flywheel have 20x more moment of inertia compared to the MMX Flywheel.

We are recording at the wonderful location of Siegfrieds Mechanical Music Museum in Rudesheim Am Rhein, Germany. The museum will livestream the upcoming Wintergatan meetup 4-6 august on their youtube channel, check it out here: https://www.youtube.com/@Musikkabinett
