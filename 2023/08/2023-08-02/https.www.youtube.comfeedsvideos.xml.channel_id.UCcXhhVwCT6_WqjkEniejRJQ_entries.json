We had so much setting up and looking for tools to do so we only managed to do three out of five turning operations, we\u00b4ll finish up the work on the lathe with the last two operations later this week. \n\nThe prototype is designed to answer the age old question: Can I play tight music using a very strong flywheel? The new flywheel have 20x more moment of inertia compared to the MMX Flywheel.\n\nWe are recording at the wonderful location of Siegfrieds Mechanical Music Museum in Rudesheim Am Rhein, Germany. The museum will livestream the upcoming Wintergatan meetup 4-6 august on their youtube channel, check it out here: https://www.youtube.com/@Musikkabinett\n\nEdited By the Glorious Hannes Knutsson From the @Trainerds  Youtube Channel\nTrainerds: https://www.youtube.com/@Trainerds\n\nWe are trying to make one video per day until the project is completed, so check back tomorrow for Part 3 xx\n\n\u2014\nMUSIC DOWNLOADS \u25ba https://wintergatan.bandcamp.com \nWINTERGATAN RECORDS \u25ba http://www.wintergatan.net/#/shop\nSPOTIFY \u25ba http://bit.ly/2oKxXWd \nITUNES \u25ba http://apple.co/2ntWNsZ \nMERCH \u25ba https://teespring.com/stores/wintergatan\nDISCORD \u25ba https://discord.gg/wintergatan\nSECOND OFFICIAL CHANNEL:\u25ba https://www.youtube.com/c/Wintergatan2021\n\u2014", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxKLo6Wjfwg", "date_published": "2023-08-02T21:00:33+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/zxKLo6Wjfwg/hqdefault.jpg"}]
