<p>UK intelligence agencies are campaigning for the government to weaken surveillance laws, arguing that the current safeguards limit their ability to train AI models due to the large amount of personal data required.</p><p>GCHQ, MI5, and MI6 have been increasingly using AI technologies to analyze data sets, including bulk personal data sets (BPDs), which can often contain sensitive information about people not of interest to the security services.</p><p>Currently, a judge has to approve the examination and retention of BPDs, a process that intelligence agencies have described as “disproportionately burdensome” when applied to “publicly available datasets, specifically those containing data in respect of which the subject has little or no reasonable expectation of privacy.”</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3703870/uk-intelligence-agencies-seek-to-weaken-data-protection-safeguards.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>Apple, Adobe, Pixar, Autodesk, NVIDIA, and the Joint Development Foundation have joined forces to develop a standard that can be used to underpin mixed- and virtual-reality experiences — a move that also undermine Meta's efforts in the AR/VR arena.</p><h2><strong>Opening up the 3D universe</strong></h2>

<p>Your Windows PC’s Snap feature is either the best feature you’re not using, or the best feature you’re probably not using to its full potential. Sure, you may have snapped some windows, but do you know about all the keyboard shortcuts, Snap Layouts, and Snap Groups — and have you tried Microsoft’s even more powerful alternative to Snap?</p><p>Snap was originally introduced in Windows 7, where it was called Aero Snap; it let you snap two windows side by side on your screen. It got an upgrade in Windows 10, letting you snap up to four windows in quarters rather than two windows in halves.</p><p>It’s even better in Windows 11 with new features like Snap Layouts and Snap Groups, making it both easier to find — and more powerful.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3703868/make-multitasking-a-snap-on-your-windows-pc.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>When Bill Mandaria was a young architect decades ago, he would follow senior designers around his office to pick their brains to learn the profession.</p><p>“In architecture, and I’d imagine in a lot of other industries, what’s particularly important is the mentorship,” said Mandaria, now co-owner of <a href="https://www.manciniduffy.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Mancini Duffy</a>, a Manhattan-based architecture and interior design firm with about 90 employees.</p><p>Mentorship, collaboration, and productivity, Mandaria argues, suffer in remote-work settings. So he began asking his employees to return to the office as soon as Manhattan would allow it during the COVID-19 pandemic -- in June 2020.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3704009/return-to-office-mandates-rise-as-worker-productivity-drops.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
