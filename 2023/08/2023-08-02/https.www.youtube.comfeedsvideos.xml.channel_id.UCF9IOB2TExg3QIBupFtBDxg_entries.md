A comprehensive view of global deaths directly and indirectly associated the COVID-19 pandemic.

https://www.who.int/data/stories/global-excess-deaths-associated-with-covid-19-january-2020-december-2021

The World Health Organization (WHO) is tracking global excess mortality as the pandemic evolves over time to reveal a picture of its full impact and burden on countries, health systems and individuals.

'Excess mortality' is defined as the difference between the total number of deaths that have occurred and the number of deaths that would have been expected in the absence of the pandemic 

i.e. a no-COVID-19 scenario.

Understanding the excess mortality:

Excess mortality includes deaths attributable directly to COVID-19,

includes deaths attributable directly to COVID-19 that were not counted or reported,

includes deaths indirectly associated with COVID-19, due to other causes and diseases, resulting from the wider impact of the pandemic on health systems and society.

It is minus any deaths that would have occurred under normal circumstances but were averted due to pandemic-related changes in social conditions and personal behaviors,

e.g. less traffic deaths or influenza deaths due to local lockdowns and less travel.

No mention of

Adverse effects of lockdowns, social, economic, psychological, psychiatric

Vaccination of individuals who are pregnant

Studies continue to support vaccination during pregnancy. 

Safety of Omicron-containing bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccines

The safety profile of the bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine boosters is comparable to that of original mRNA COVID-19 vaccine boosters 

No evidence on VE against infant outcomes is available for vaccination with bivalent mRNA vaccines in persons who are pregnant.

In Western Australia

Total AEFI rate following a COVID-19 vaccine was 264.1 per 100,000 doses. 

26.41 per 10 thousand 
2.641 per thousand
0.241%
One in 414 doses

Of these AEFI, (adverse events following immunisation)

10,428 (97%) occurred after a COVID-19 vaccine

21 times more common than ‘conventional’ vaccines
