At least 21 people have been killed and an estimated 30 are missing across the affected region. </p><p></p><p>Beijing recorded 74.48cm (29.3in) of rain between Saturday and Wednesday, the Beijing meteorological bureau said on Wednesday, the heaviest rain since records began almost 140 years ago. The city of Zhouzhou in the Hubei province, south-west of Beijing, is one of the worst-hit cities. Footage on state media showed rescue workers using rubber boats to pass throughout submerged streets to help people stranded by the floods. President Xi Jinping has urged rescue workers to make 'every effort' to help people affected by the storm. </p><p></p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/02/beijing-reports-heaviest-rain-140-years-china-g20-climate-talks\">Chinese firefighter \u2018dies heroic death\u2019 as Beijing reports heaviest rain in 140 years</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/02/aftermath-of-typhoon-doksuri-brought-beijing-floods-meteorologists-explain\">Aftermath of Typhoon Doksuri brought Beijing floods, meteorologists explain</a></p></li></ul><p></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2023/aug/02/severe-rainfall-from-typhoon-doksuri-causes-floods-across-northern-china-video\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2023/aug/02/severe-rainfall-from-typhoon-doksuri-causes-floods-across-northern-china-video", "date_published": "2023-08-02T21:45:24+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "Latino Northwestern player says \u2018Cinco de Mayo\u2019 was shaved into his head", "description": "<ul><li>Ramon Diaz says he saw other incidents of racist abuse</li><li>University faces numerous lawsuits over culture of hazing</li></ul><p>Ramon Diaz says he was just 17 when Northwestern University upperclassmen shaved \u201cCinco de Mayo\u201d onto the back of his head as the entire football team watched.</p><p>\u201cThe holiday itself has a significant meaning to me and my family and then the Latino community at large,\u201d Diaz told the Associated Press. \u201cI was mocked and ridiculed.\u201d</p><p><em>In the US, you can call or text the <a href=\"https://988lifeline.org/\">National Suicide Prevention Lifeline</a> on 988, chat on <a href=\"https://988lifeline.org/chat/\">988lifeline.org</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.crisistextline.org/\">text HOME</a> to 741741 to connect with a crisis counselor.
