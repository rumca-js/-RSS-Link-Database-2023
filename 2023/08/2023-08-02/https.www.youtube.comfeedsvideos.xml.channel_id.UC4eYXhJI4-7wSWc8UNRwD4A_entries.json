OB and crew seemed shy but ready for this moment. During the show, I witnessed my colleagues go from wiping away tears to bouncing and clapping within a matter of minutes. That emotional balance is Obongjayar\u2019s Tiny Desk in a nutshell. He gave us everything. \n\nThe Nigerian-born, London-based Steven Umoh beelined it straight to the desk to dial in with the band. His towering presence, juxtaposed with a high-register tone that sometimes dips into a low growl, simply commands attention. I first learned of Obongjayar through Little Simz. He was featured on \u201cPoint and Kill,\u201d which they performed for a Tiny Desk home concert in 2021. The following year, he dropped his debut album Some Nights I Dream of Doors. While most of the set focused on the best of Some Nights\u2026, he also plays the newly released \u201cJust Cool\u201d before closing with the awe-inspiring protest cut, \u201cMessage in a Hammer.\u201d\n\nSET LIST\n\u201cSugar\u201d\n\u201cFrens\u201d\n\u201cJust Cool\u201d\n\u201cI Wish It Was Me\u201d\n\u201cMessage in a Hammer\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nObongjayar: lead vocal\nSam Jones: drums\nCiaran Corr: guitar\nMutale Chashi: bass, keys\nElias Atkinson: trumpet\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector/Editor: Kara Frame\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nCreative Director: Bob Boilen\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Alant\u00e9 Serene\nAudio Assistant: Kwesi Lee\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Keren Carri\u00f3n\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Maia Stern, Hazel Cills\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #obongjayar #nprmusic", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILOnnEW2iRg", "date_published": "2023-08-02T09:00:12+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/ILOnnEW2iRg/hqdefault.jpg"}]
