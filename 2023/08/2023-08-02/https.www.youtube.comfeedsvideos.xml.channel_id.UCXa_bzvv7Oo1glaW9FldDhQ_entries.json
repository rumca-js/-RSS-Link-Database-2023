There are games like Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man 2 and Marvel\u2019s Wolverine to look forward to, but there\u2019s also Indie-Us Games\u2019 upcoming UNRESTRICTED which you probably didn\u2019t know much about. \n\nIt puts you in the shoes of an ordinary college guy who gets superpowers thanks to a meteorite crash - and must now save the world from an otherworldly danger. UNRESTRICTED has impressive flight mechanics, and the combat is fast flowing with plenty of varied attacks to choose from and chain together for some amazing feats. The world also looks pretty large in terms of square footing and features a number of distinct locales, which comes together to make UNRESTRICTED a solid game that\u2019s worth looking forward to.\n\nPlease consider subscribing for more awesome videos! https://www.youtube.com/@GamingBolt?sub_confirmation=1\n\nGame information:\n\nUNRESTRICTED \nRelease Date: TBA\nPlatforms: Microsoft Windows", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvVYDtyMMkE", "date_published": "2023-08-02T15:30:09+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/gvVYDtyMMkE/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "25 BEST POST-APOCALYPTIC GAMES On PC You Can't Afford To Miss", "description": "Post-apocalyptic games are some of the strangest forms of escapism since you're essentially exploring destroyed worlds (if not locally confined areas). Nevertheless, there's a certain peace to it all, whether you're roaming the landscape and making your own rules or picking up the pieces of society.\n\nHowever, some games go in a different direction. The world may be completely uninhabitable, necessitating building a vehicle to stay alive or living underground. Horrible mutations may roam the landscape. Sometimes, you'll be choosing a side (or battling against) factions over what little resources are remaining.\n\nWhatever the case is, there's still an appeal to survival and overcoming the odds.
