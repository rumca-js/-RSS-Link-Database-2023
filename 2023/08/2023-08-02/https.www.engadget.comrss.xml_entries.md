<p>Elon Musk says he plans<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1686828350289887232"> to ask</a> Tim Cook to adjust the App Store fees X pays on subscriptions as part of a plan to boost creators earnings on the platform that was, until recently, known as Twitter. The remarks are the latest example of Musk calling out the “App Store tax” Apple takes from in-app purchases.</p><p>Musk framed the ask as part of a broader effort to help creators get paid more for paying subscribers. “While we had previously said that 𝕏 would keep nothing for the [first] 12 months, then 10%, we are amending that policy to 𝕏 keeps nothing forever, until payout exceeds $100k, then 10%,” he tweeted. “Apple does take 30%, but I will speak with @tim_cook and see if that can be adjusted to be just 30% of what 𝕏 keeps in order to maximize what creators receive.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="cf2fc212c83b42e5a06d0e6a3ded8080"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Super Important to Support Creators!<br /><br />If you can afford it, please subscribe to as many creators on this platform as you find interesting. <br /><br />People from every corner of the world post incredible content on 𝕏, but often live in tough circumstances, where even a few hundred…</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1686828350289887232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 2, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>It’s unclear if Musk’s request has any chance of success. Cook seems unlikely to make such a concession, as he’s long ducked criticism from numerous other developers about the App Store’s fees and the policies surrounding them. Apple and X didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>However, it’s not the first time Musk has publicly called out Apple’s App Store policies. He previously <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1597301968208556032">complained</a> about Apple’s “secret 30% tax” on in-app purchases, and reportedly delayed the launch of Twitter Blue to avoid the fees. He’s also accused the iPhone maker of threatening “to withhold” Twitter’s from the App Store, though he later said that was a “misunderstanding” after a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-says-he-and-tim-cook-resolved-the-misunderstanding-about-twitter-005702715.html">private meeting</a> with Cook.</p><p>Regardless, Musk and X would greatly benefit from a boost in paying subscribers, which seems to be the motivation for Musk again calling attention to the issue. The company’s ad revenue is down more than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-says-twitters-ad-revenue-has-dropped-by-50-percent-202600398.html">50 percent</a> as many advertisers have yet to return to spending at the same level as before he took over Twitter. Generating more subscribers— via creators and Twitter Blue — could help the company become less reliant on ad revenue, though the company would need <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2022/11/14/twitter-would-need-64-million-subscribers-to-replace-existing-revenue-and-cover-existing-losses/?sh=66a0d5eca95f">tens of millions</a> of subscribers, if not more, to make up the deficit.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-says-hell-ask-tim-cook-to-lower-app-store-fees-for-x-subscriptions-223952210.html?src=rss

<p>Microsoft is rolling out <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-windows-copilot-ai-panos-panay-interview-150044298.html">Windows Copilot</a> in preview today. Windows 11 Insiders in the Beta Channel can install a preview build that offers the first semi-public availability for the AI-infused sidebar announced at Build 2023. “This first preview focuses on our integrated UI experience, with additional functionality coming down the road in future previews,” the company wrote in a <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/08/02/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-22621-2129-and-22631-2129/">blog post</a> today.</p><p>Windows Copilot is a system-level version of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-edge-ai-copilot-184033427.html">browser-based Copilot</a> the company began previewing in February. Microsoft views the tool — also coming to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-365-copilot-uses-ai-to-automate-everyday-tasks-in-multiple-apps-151133434.html">Microsoft Office</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsofts-redesigned-teams-app-is-faster-and-less-of-a-memory-hog-162949623.html">Teams</a> — as representing a monumental shift in how customers interact with Microsoft software. “AI is going to be the single largest driver of innovation for Windows in the years to come,” Panos Panay, Microsoft Executive Vice President and Chief Product Officer, told Engadget’s Devindra Hardawar in an interview at Build 2023. “It’s going to change the way you work, change your interaction models to make it easier. It’s going to understand so much about what you need.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Microsoft says the preview’s “controlled feature rollout” will hold back some of Copilot’s full functionality for future builds. The company also cautions that new Windows Insiders joining the Beta Channel today won’t be able to install this update. It says even some established Windows Insiders may not see the build immediately, but it will “increase the rollout in the coming weeks.” The rollout follows Microsoft’s release of a <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/06/29/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-23493/">Copilot Preview</a> in late June for developers running preview builds.</p><figure><img alt="Microsoft screenshot showing its Copilot AI feature responding to questions about a Spotify playlist.

For example, you can ask it to perform basic Windows tasks like “Change to dark mode” or “Turn on do not disturb.” In addition, it can summarize active websites in the Edge browser, compose stories and generate AI art. The company says an ellipses button at the top right of the Copilot sidebar lets you submit feedback.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/microsofts-ai-infused-sidebar-rolls-out-to-windows-11-beta-testers-211546573.html?src=rss

## Keychron's first gaming keyboard is the customizable Lemokey L3

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/keychron-q1-pro-bluetooth-customizable-keyboard-143008367.html">Keychron</a> is one of the better-known names in the customizable keyboard space, but it hasn't directly targeted gamers — until now, that is. The company has <a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/2023/08/prweb19469072.htm">launched</a> a gaming division, Lemokey, whose first product is the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lemokey/lemokey-l3-a-24-ghz-qmk-custom-mechanical-keyboard">crowdfunded L3 keyboard</a>. The full-length peripheral supports a 2.4GHz wireless connection with a responsive 1,000Hz polling rate, but the real attraction is a tough, customizable aluminum body that can reportedly survive the rigors of competitive gaming.</p><p>You can choose from three different keycap color schemes, remap any key and create macros for both any key command layer as well as a dedicated macro column. You can easily remove and replace components to tailor them to your liking. The Lemokey L3 can pair with up to three devices over Bluetooth 5.1, but there's also a wired option if low latency is your main priority.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company currently expects to deliver the Lemokey L3 in October. You need to pledge at least $189 for the barebones kit (no caps or switches), but you'll more realistically want to commit $209 for a fully assembled version. The project has already met its funding goals.</p><p>The L3 won't be appealing if you prefer 60 percent keyboards or are otherwise more interested in space saving than a compact footprint. This won't necessarily appeal to top-tier esports players, either, as they may insist on a wired link or use a favorite design. For many other gamers, though, Lemokey's offering might strike a balance between personalization and performance.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/keychrons-first-gaming-keyboard-is-the-customizable-lemokey-l3-204239893.html?src=rss

## AI-assisted cancer screening could cut radiologist workloads in half

<p>A newly published study in the the <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(23)00298-X/fulltext"><em><ins>Lancet Oncology</ins></em><ins> journal</ins></a> has found that the use of AI in mammogram cancer screening can safely cut radiologist workloads nearly in half without risk of increasing false-positive results. In effect, the study found that the AI’s recommendations were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/aug/02/ai-use-breast-cancer-screening-study-preliminary-results"><ins>on par with those of two radiologists working together</ins></a>.</p><p>“AI-supported mammography screening resulted in a similar cancer detection rate compared with standard double reading, with a substantially lower screen-reading workload, indicating that the use of AI in mammography screening is safe,” the study found.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The study was performed by a research team out of Lund University in Sweden and, accordingly, followed 80,033 Swedish women (average age of 54) for just over a year in 2021-2022 . Of the 39,996 patients that were randomly assigned AI-empowered breast cancer screenings, 28 percent or 244 tests returned screen-detected cancers. Of the other 40,024 patients that received conventional cancer screenings, just 25 percent, or 203 tests, returned screen-detected cancers.</p><p>Of those extra 41 cancers detected by the AI side, 19 turned out to be invasive. Both the AI-empowered and conventional screenings ran a 1.5 percent false positive rate. Most impressively, radiologists on the the AI side had to look at 36,886 fewer screen readings than their counterparts, a 44 percent reduction in their workload.</p><p>“These promising interim safety results should be used to inform new trials and program-based evaluations to address the pronounced radiologist shortage in many countries, but they are not enough on their own to confirm that AI is ready to be implemented in mammography screening,&quot; lead author, Dr Kristina Lång, warned in a release. “We still need to understand the implications on patients’ outcomes, especially whether combining radiologists’ expertise with AI can help detect interval cancers that are often missed by traditional screening, as well as the cost-effectiveness of the technology.”</p><p>Cancer detection has been an aspirational goal for computer vision researchers and AI companies for years now. I mean, who doesn’t want to be the company to build the tricorder that infallibly spots cancerous growths in their earliest stages? Machine vision systems designed for these screenings have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-07-mit-ai-model-breast-cancer.html"><ins>improved steadily in recent years</ins></a> and in specific cases have shown to be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-17-mit-ai-identify-breast-cancer-risk-radiologist.html"><ins>as reliable as human clinicians</ins></a>, with the likes of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-18-ibm-ai-predicts-breast-cancer.html"><ins>IBM</ins></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-20-google-ai-lung-cancer-screening.html"><ins>Google</ins></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mi-ts-oncological-risk-algorithm-calculates-cancer-chances-across-all-races-190033653.html"><ins>MIT</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-and-medtronic-are-building-an-ai-enhanced-endoscopy-tool-161532723.html"><ins>NVIDIA</ins></a> investing in similar cancer screening research in recent years.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai-assisted-cancer-screening-could-cut-radiologist-workloads-in-half-193427969.html?src=rss

## The IRS wants to phase out most IRL tax documents by 2025

<p>Most taxpayers will have the option of going entirely paperless starting with the 2024 filing season. The IRS <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1666">said</a> today that it aims to “achieve paperless processing for all tax returns” by 2025. The agency says the IRS Paperless Processing Initiative will “eliminate up to 200 million pieces of paper annually, cut processing times in half and expedite refunds by several weeks.” The project is funded by President Biden’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/senate-passes-inflation-reduction-act-2022-214410930.html">Inflation Reduction Act of 2022</a>.</p><p>The IRS expects the changes will solve the annoyance of transmitting digital documents in some cases but still having to mail paper ones in others. “For decades, taxpayers had to respond to notices for things like document verification through the mail, and IRS employees had to manually enter numbers from paper returns into computers one digit at a time, creating significant delays for taxpayers and challenges for IRS staff,” the US Treasury Department wrote today.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Starting next year (2024 filling season), taxpayers can digitally submit all correspondence — including many non-tax forms. The IRS says at least 20 additional e-File tax forms will be available digitally starting then. It estimates that over 94 percent of individual filers will never have to mail another tax form or document. The initiative will spare taxpayers from sending approximately 125 million paper documents annually.</p><p>By the 2025 filling season, “an additional 150 of the most used non-tax forms will be available in digital, mobile-friendly formats.” (The IRS cites research showing that around 15 percent of Americans rely solely on their phones for internet access.) It says all paper-filed tax and information returns — an estimated 76 million paper documents per year — will be processed digitally as soon as it receives them. Similarly, half of paper-submitted correspondence, non-tax forms and notice responses (another 60 million paper docs) will be recorded digitally. Finally, the IRS also plans to digitize up to one billion historical documents, making accessing older filing data easier for customer service agents and taxpayers.</p><p>The IRS says its Paperless Processing Initiative will help eliminate errors from manual data entry, speed up processing and let the agency pour more resources into taxpayer support. “Customer service employees do not currently have easy access to the information from paper returns and other correspondence submitted by mail,” the Treasury Department wrote. “Digitization and data extraction will give them access to that information they need to better serve taxpayers.”</p><p>The agency also expects digitization will help them to hold billionaires and corporations accountable. “When combined with an improved data platform, digitization and data extraction will enable data scientists to implement advanced analytics and pattern recognition methods to pursue cases that can help address the tax gap, including wealthy individuals and large corporations using complex structures to evade taxes they owe.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-irs-wants-to-phase-out-most-irl-tax-documents-by-2025-192105265.html?src=rss

<p>The original Sonos Move stood out as one of the few fully connected portable speakers when it debuted in 2019, but technology has moved on since then — and so, apparently, has Sonos. <em>The Verge</em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/2/23817225/sonos-move-2-speaker-features-specs-price">claims</a> to have leaked details of a Move 2 speaker that promises major upgrades to the outdoor-friendly device. Most notably, it should upgrade from mono to stereo sound. If you thought the first version didn't sound as good as conventional speakers, you may be happier this time.</p><p>The new speaker's battery life reportedly leaps from 10 hours on the Move to a full 24 hours of playback You could easily host an all-day party without plugging in. The power pack is said to still be replaceable, and reduced idle power consumption could make it easier to use the speaker over the course of a weekend.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There will reportedly be smaller but still useful upgrades. Like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-roam-review-130039811.html">the Roam</a>, the Move 2 will let you share Bluetooth audio across the home. Bluetooth 5.0 and WiFi 6 support will also help the speaker keep up with modern devices. You'll need a USB-C adapter (as with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-era-100-review-affordable-multi-room-audio-that-actually-sounds-good-130007717.html">Era 100</a>) for line-in audio, but the same port can also charge your phone during a camping trip. The IP56 dust and water resistance hasn't changed, but that's still good enough to survive the rain or a windy day.</p><p>Other touches may include revised controls, a mic cutoff switch and a detachable power adapter on the base station. You can't use Google Assistant <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-fined-325-million-for-infringing-on-sonos-patent-210411398.html">for obvious reasons</a>, but Alexa and Sonos' own voice controls would be available.</p><p>Sonos is said to be launching the Move 2 at the end of September for $449, or $50 more than its predecessor.

<p>The unconventional sports sim <em>What the Golf</em> is officially coming to PS4 and PS5 consoles later this year. The release is set to include all current updates, which is always nice, and has been optimized for Sony consoles. This includes haptic-based DualSense support so you can really feel the impact of striking a ball, a cat or an entire planet toward a hole (it’s a weird and funny game.)</p><p><em>What the Golf </em>takes the basic notions of a golf sim and upends them entirely. There are plenty of ludicrous golf-adjacent minigames and the rules change on a dime, leading to hilarious multiplayer matchups. Some levels take you to space, while others transform the golf ball into an office chair, among many other objects. The absurdity on display has made the game a hit, even among those <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-22-what-the-golf-demo.html"><ins>who have little interest in golf.</ins></a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The game originally released on Apple Arcade, but was eventually <a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-the-golf-nintendo-switch-174555359.html"><ins>ported to the Nintendo Switch</ins></a>. To that end, the Switch version is getting a beefy update tomorrow, August 3rd, that features a crossover with murder/snitch simulator <em>Among Us.</em> The update includes a new overworld and 35 new levels. These levels already launched for Apple Arcade back in April, but this is the first time they'll be available on a dedicated gaming console. The PC version is also getting some <em>Among Us</em> love.</p><div id="b783ff50dcba490993e117824a037495"></div><p>Developer Triband has also announced seasonal updates dropping over the course of the next year. These will include new stages and other surprises, coinciding with holidays like Thanksgiving and Valentine’s Day. All versions of the game will have access to these free updates, including Switch, PC, PS4 and PS5. It all starts with the Halloween-themed <em>Beware of the Bogeyman,</em> which is available from October 23rd until November 5th.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile-hit-what-the-golf-is-coming-to-playstation-soon-175141459.html?src=rss

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/bytedance/">ByteDance</a> is facing a class-action lawsuit over claims that its CapCut video-editing app is vacuuming up data from its more than 200 million active users without consent. Among other things, the lawsuit, which was filed in Illinois, claims that CapCut violates the state's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-26-illinois-biometric-privacy-law-passes-a-key-test-in-court.html">Biometric Information Privacy Act</a> (BIPA) by collecting data like face scans and voiceprints without informing users or getting express permission.</p><p>The app also allegedly collects details about a user's location, date of birth and gender as well as their photos and videos. Much of this is said to be in service of delivering targeted ads. In addition, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23893313-https-ecf-ilnd-uscourts-gov-doc1-067128956016">the suit</a> claims that the app is capable of harvesting data from user devices, including the MAC address and SIM serial number.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The lawsuit, which <a href="https://therecord.media/capcut-privacy-lawsuit-illinois-bipa-bytedance-china"><em>The Record</em></a> unearthed, asserts that CapCut's privacy policy was designed to make it hard for people to understand or to give the app “meaningful, express consent.” One plaintiff who started using the app while in the seventh grade was allegedly able to use CapCut without having to sign up for an account, reviewing a privacy policy or having parental consent.</p><p>Moreover, the suit points out that, since ByteDance is headquartered in Beijing, the company may be compelled to share CapCut data with the Chinese government. It claims that a former ByteDance official revealed publicly that the Chinese Communist Party can use a “backdoor channel code&quot; to access data on users based outside of the country, including those in the US.</p><p>ByteDance, of course, owns TikTok, which has long been the subject of claims that the Chinese government can access US user data. The company has been trying to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/can-tiktok-convince-the-us-its-not-a-national-security-threat-173030115.html">convince US regulators</a> that TikTok <a href="https://www.engadget.com/people-who-dont-use-tiktok-think-its-a-national-security-threat-203921153.html">doesn't pose a threat to national security</a>. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew claimed at a congressional hearing earlier this year that &quot;ByteDance is not an agent of China or any other country.&quot;</p><p>Since last year, TikTok has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-user-data-us-200500287.html">routing</a> all US user data to Oracle servers based in the country. That initiative, called Project Texas, also included the goal of removing US users' private TikTok data from ByteDance's own data centers.</p><p>Nonetheless, Montana legislators have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-is-suing-montana-over-law-banning-the-app-in-the-state-200642508.html">passed a bill</a> to ban TikTok outright in the state. Many other jurisdictions, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-us-government-ban-devices-omnibus-bill-funding-nasa-234803320.html">the federal government</a>, have prohibited the app on nearly all state-owned devices. The Justice Department is reportedly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bytedance-is-reportedly-under-investigation-for-surveillance-of-us-journalists-224223010.html">looking into claims</a> that four ByteDance employees used TikTok to snoop on the locations of two US journalists.</p><p>The class-action suit asks a district court to block ByteDance from sending CapCut user data and content to China, and from collecting users' biometric information and other data without consent. The plaintiffs asked the court to compel ByteDance to delete any user data and content it unlawfully obtained through CapCut as well. In addition, the suit seeks unspecified damages.</p><p>Engadget has asked ByteDance for comment.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/bytedance-sued-for-allegedly-collecting-biometric-data-without-consent-172411924.html?src=rss

## Nintendo brings 'Mario Kart 8' and 'Splatoon' for Wii U back online August 3rd

<p>It took <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-takes-wii-u-games-mario-kart-8-and-splatoon-offline-over-security-issues-183052954.html">several months</a>, but you can finally play the Wii U versions of <em>Mario Kart 8</em> and <em>Splatoon</em> online. Nintendo has confirmed that both titles will once again be available for multiplayer as of August 3rd. The company has fixed the security vulnerability that prompted the shutdown of online service in March.</p><p>Nintendo still hasn't detailed the flaw. However, enthusiast and tinkerer OatmealDome <a href="https://twitter.com/OatmealDome/status/1631515908219842560">claims</a> the last-gen console is vulnerable to an &quot;ENLBufferPwn&quot; attack that lets intruders take over the console when it goes online. The company reportedly fixed the bug last year for affected Switch titles well as <em>Mario Kart 7</em>, but didn't make a similar effort for the Wii U versions until now.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You'll need to update both games to resume online play. The months-long wait isn't completely surprising when the Switch has been Nintendo's current system for several years, and is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-switch-has-outsold-the-playstation-4-but-nintendo-sees-tougher-times-ahead-100631336.html">clearly more popular</a>. Still, this is good news if you're not in a rush to replace your Wii U — you won't have to stop using the older system if you still enjoy the affected titles.</p><p>With that said, there's little doubt that Nintendo wants to wean gamers off the earlier console. The company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-extends-deadline-to-redeem-3ds-and-wii-u-eshop-codes-until-april-3rd-105014518.html">shut down the Wii U eShop</a> this spring, limiting users to re-downloading existing purchases. Unless you grab physical copies, your game library is frozen in time unless you move to the Switch.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-brings-mario-kart-8-and-splatoon-for-wii-u-back-online-august-3rd-165434085.html?src=rss

## Google could be taking the Chrome out of ChromeOS

<p>Google has reportedly been <a href="https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/lacros-vs-chrome-and-chrome-os-on-chromebooks/"><ins>working for years to separate</ins></a> the Chrome browser from Chrome OS, that’s how entangled they are, and it looks like this project is ready to bear fruit. The solution seems to be a new-ish standalone Linux-based browser, named Lacros, that would replace the current Chrome OS-based browser. What’s more? Lacros is nearly ready for primetime, <a href="https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/chromeos-116-may-begin-the-lacros-browser-push-to-chromebooks/?expand_article=1"><ins>according to </ins><em><ins>About Chromebooks. </ins></em></a></p><p>Why does this matter? As it stands, you need a full Chrome OS update to make any changes to the browser. This isn’t the most efficient means to issue browser patches, thus the years-long search for a decoupling solution. Additionally, older Chromebooks lose access to system updates, so this move could potentially make these machines more secure.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You can already use Lacros, but it launches alongside the built-in Chrome browser and requires a fair bit of know-how to get going. <em>About Chromebooks</em> found some <a href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/4726966/3/docs/lacros/enable_disable.md"><ins>small code changes</ins></a> that suggest that Lacros is set to release as the default browser for Chromebooks, potentially eliminating the current browser altogether. This means that new Chromebooks would feature Lacros as the browser directly out of the box, allowing browser-specific patches and updates without involving the operating system.</p><p>Also, these changes look to be coming soon, like real soon. All points indicate the very next system update, Chrome OS 116, will bring Lacros into the mainstream. Chrome OS updates hit <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/6025002?hl=en"><ins>around once a month,</ins></a> so probably at the end of August or the beginning of September. It remains unclear if the system update will make Lacros the default browser or if it’ll just remove restrictions to using Lacros instead of the default browser.</p><p>In the meantime, recent Chrome OS updates have included <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-rolls-out-android-app-streaming-to-chromebooks-following-beta-203014704.html"><ins>Android app streaming</ins></a> and a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-photos-chrome-os-video-editor-160037434.html"><ins>robust video editor.</ins></a></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-could-be-taking-the-chrome-out-of-chromeos-164057852.html?src=rss

<p>Sometimes a revamp is nothing more than bells and whistles, and other times it completely changes your experience. Google is gunning for the second, announcing new updates for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chrome-lock-incognito-tabs-android-biometric-authentication-054147765.html">Chrome on mobile</a> and desktop that focus on integration and efficiency. New mobile features concentrate on improving your search process, while Chrome for desktop is streamlining how you download and access files from the web.&nbsp;</p><p>On Chrome mobile, a new webpage should now show a category called &quot;Trending searches,&quot; and as you type, ten versus the previous six recommendations will appear. Similarly, say you're on a site about the best pizza places in New York — if you click on the URL up top, related searches will appear below in a new category called &quot;Related to this page.&quot; You can also tap on a word in that article, like a neighborhood in New York it discusses, and use Touch to Search to see other topics you want to explore, such as hotels in that area. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-06-05-chrome-android-search-update.html">Touch to Search</a> is exclusive to Android and has already existed in browsers as a way to find specific words.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As for your <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chrome-makes-it-easier-to-customize-your-browsers-look-160059034.html">Chrome for desktop</a>, say goodbye to the clunky download bar that pops up at the bottom of your screen (and having to close it yourself). Moving forward, downloads will appear on the top right of your browser, just next to your account image. When you go to save something, a circle will appear around the icon, turning blue as it finishes the download. You can click the button to view anything saved in the last 24 hours, open the folder containing a specific file and retry, pause, resume or cancel your download. While this will be the default placement for everyone moving forward, it might have been live for some people already. Google will still warn you if a download seems suspicious and let you drag and drop downloads as needed.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/googles-chrome-updates-bring-improved-search-to-mobile-and-simpler-desktop-downloads-160003908.html?src=rss

## Meta releases an open source AI kit that creates audio from text prompts

<p>Meta is making it easier for artists and sound designers to produce audio using only AI. The Facebook owner has <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/08/audiocraft-generative-ai-for-music-and-audio/">released</a> an open source AudioCraft kit that bundles three existing generative AI models for creating sounds from text descriptions. AudioGen and MusicGen respectively produce sound effects and music, while EnCodec compresses sounds to produce higher-quality results. A musician or sound designer might have everything they need to compose pieces.</p><p>The release includes pre-trained AudioGen models for those who want to start quickly, and tinkerers will have access to the entire AudioCraft code and model weighting. The open source debut gives pros and researchers a chance to train the models using their own data, Meta says. All the pre-trained models use either public or Meta-owned material, so there's no chance of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/copyright-in-spotlight-after-streaming-platforms-pull-ai-generated-drake-song-183513972.html">copyright disputes</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The tech firm characterizes AudioCraft as a way to make generative AI audio simpler and more accessible. Where AI-produced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dall-e-generative-ai-tracking-data-privacy-160034656.html">images</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-is-suddenly-everywhere-are-we-ready-180031821.html">text</a> have been popular, Meta believes sound has lagged &quot;a bit behind.&quot; Existing projects tend to be complicated and frequently closed off. In theory, the new kit gives creators the opportunity to shape their own models and otherwise stretch what's possible.</p><p>This isn't the only open text-to-audio AI on the market. Google opened up its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-opens-up-access-to-its-text-to-music-ai-202251175.html">MusicLM model</a> in May. Meta's system also isn't designed for everyday users — you'll still need to be technically inclined to use AudioCraft properly. This is more for research, the company says.  The developers are also trying to improve the performance and control methods for these models, expanding their potential.</p><p>Even in its current state, though, AudioCraft may hint at the future of AI's role in music. While you won't necessarily see artists using AI to completely replace their own creativity (even experimenters <a href="https://www.engadget.com/holly-plus-holly-herndon-dolly-parton-jolene-ai-cover-204750236.html">like Holly Herndon</a> are still highly involved), they're getting more tools that let them create backing tracks, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/this-free-plugin-uses-ai-to-generate-music-samples-from-text-prompts-165058168.html">samples</a> and other elements with relatively little effort.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/meta-releases-an-open-source-ai-kit-that-creates-audio-from-text-prompts-152026368.html?src=rss

<p>It's about to get easier to stream your <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-xbox-games-140022399.html">favorite console games</a>: Discord has announced it's rolling out Stream to Discord for Xbox, allowing you to stream directly from your Xbox Series X|S or Xbox One. This news marks the first implementation of a console streaming directly to Discord, which has only been available for PC and mobile gamers. Xbox has typically received new Discord features <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-ps5-update-discord-voice-chat-rollout-131503910.html">before its competitor Playstation</a>, such as last year's update allowing gamers to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-november-update-discord-twitch-181425153.html">connect directly to Discord Voice channels</a>.</p><p>If you haven't already, you'll need to connect your Xbox to Discord in the Connections menu on your desktop or mobile app — just click on the Xbox logo and sign into your Microsoft account. You can stream right from a Voice channel by opening the Parties &amp; Chats tab on your Xbox, choosing Discord, and then picking the channel you want to join. From there, all you need to do is click &quot;Stream your game&quot; whenever you want to start broadcasting your game. Stream to Discord for Xbox is also available in one-on-one or group DMs by clicking &quot;transfer to Xbox&quot; while on the call. Then, just like in a channel, you can choose to stream your game to your friends. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/discord-themes-nitro-subscription-100135630.html">Nitro subscribers</a> will notice their streams appear in HD and up to 1080p.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Stream to Discord is now available for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-xbox-insiders-free-access-classic-bethesda-first-person-shooters-114002467.html">Xbox Insiders</a> and will be rolling out &quot;soon&quot; to all Xbox players. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-pc-game-pass-40-new-countries-131022625.html">Xbox Insider Hub app</a> is available for anyone to download through the Xbox store. Discord also claims they &quot;are far from finished&quot; with their Xbox integration and will have more announcements later in the year.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/xbox-gamers-can-now-stream-directly-to-discord-150045129.html?src=rss

<p>With <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ai/"><ins>artificial intelligence</ins></a> becoming increasingly prominent, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/kickstarter/"><ins>Kickstarter</ins></a> wants you to know if and how it’s being used in any projects on the platform. The company will soon require creators to disclose any use of AI in their projects. The policy will apply to every project that’s submitted on or after August 29th.</p><p>“We want to make sure that any project that is funded through Kickstarter includes human creative input and properly credits and obtains permission for any artist's work that it references,” Kickstarter’s director of trust and safety Susannah Page-Katz <a href="https://updates.kickstarter.com/introducing-our-new-ai-policy/"><ins>wrote in a blog post</ins></a>. “The policy requires creators to be transparent and specific about how they use AI in their projects because when we’re all on the same page about what a project entails, it builds trust and sets the project up for success.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The project submission process will soon include a new set of AI-related questions. Creators will have to disclose if their project generates outputs using AI, if it primarily concerns the development of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/generative-ai/"><ins>generative AI</ins></a> tech or if it uses AI in another way. They'll need to reveal which parts of their projects feature entirely original work.</p><p>Kickstarter will also ask creators to state whether they have permission to use works or data that are employed in AI-generated aspects of their projects. They'll need to provide a sense of how their sources of data deal with consent and credit. &quot;If the sources don’t have processes or safeguards in place to manage consent, such as through an opt-out or opt-in mechanism, then Kickstarter is unlikely to allow the project,&quot; Page-Katz wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>If creators don't properly disclose their use of AI during the submission process, Kickstarter may suspend the project. Those who try to bypass Kickstarter's policies or purposefully misrepresent their project won't be allowed to submit another one.</p><p>Human moderators will review submissions and, if they're accepted, Kickstarter will disclose any use of AI in a new section on applicable project pages in the creator's own words. The company suggests its approach will help mitigate the community's concerns over AI. It formulated the policy with the help of input from its staff, creators and backers, as well as &quot;other platform leaders.&quot; AI technologies will keep evolving quickly and as such, Kickstarter plans to revisit the policy and modify it if necessary.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/kickstarter-projects-will-soon-have-to-disclose-any-ai-use-145100394.html?src=rss

<p>China might put further <a href="https://www.engadget.com/china-cuts-kids-gaming-time-132539606.html">limits on kids' smartphone use</a>. The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) has <a href="http://www.cac.gov.cn/2023-08/02/c_1692541991073784.htm">proposed</a> draft rules that would cap the phone time of children under 18 to a maximum of two hours per day. That's only for 16- and 17-year-olds, too. Youth between eight and 15 would be limited to one hour per day, while those under eight would have 40 minutes.</p><p>The draft would also bar any use between 10PM and 6AM. Phones would need to have an easy-to-access mode that lets parents restrict what kids see and permit internet providers to show age-appropriate content. Children under three would be limited to songs and other forms of audio, while those 12 and up can see educational and news material. There would be exceptions for regulated educational content and emergency services.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As with previous measures, the proposal is meant to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/china-law-bans-online-games-that-addict-kids-181301284.html">curb addictive behaviour</a> in children. The Chinese government is concerned prolonged use of mobile devices, games and services may be detrimental to kids' development. The country already limits young people to three hours of online video game time per week, and then only on weekends and public holidays.&nbsp;</p><p>The draft is still open to public consultation and isn't guaranteed to pass. There are also questions about implementation. <em>CNBC</em><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=34e37b9c-8975-48da-aa39-df8bcd5badc3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CNBC&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNGUzN2I5Yy04OTc1LTQ4ZGEtYWEzOS1kZjhiY2Q1YmFkYzMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vMjAyMy8wOC8wMi9jaGluYS1mbG9hdHMtdHdvLWhvdXItZGFpbHktbGltaXQtb2Ytc21hcnRwaG9uZS1zY3JlZW4tdGltZS1mb3Ita2lkcy5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2ODE5M2QyZi0zNGQ0LTQyODItODQ2ZC05ODM1ZWUyODY4YzIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdSDq8Hh6XoY7K_xV1PbZkHb4FI4qYRvO8P0AUT5ioel&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2023%2F08%2F02%2Fchina-floats-two-hour-daily-limit-of-smartphone-screen-time-for-kids.html">notes</a> it isn't clear whether hardware manufacturers or operating system developers are responsible for implementing the kids mode. While Apple would have to change the iPhone's parental controls in China regardless of this distinction, involving the OS developer might require that Google make changes, not just vendors like Oppo or Xiaomi.</p><p>The rules would also have a significant effect for Chinese app developers like ByteDance (responsible for TikTok and its China-native counterpart Douyin) and Tencent (the maker of WeChat and many games). They may have to design apps and tailor content around these time limits.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/china-considers-limiting-kids-smartphone-time-to-two-hours-per-day-134708060.html?src=rss

But over the years, the company has made a number of changes to reduce the fragility of its flagship foldable phone. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review-5g-foldable-phone-specs-price-143057288.html">Galaxy Z Fold 2</a> featured a redesigned hinge that prevented dirt from getting inside, while the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review-s-pen-camera-battery-test-190051606.html">Z Fold 3</a> added IPX8 water resistance and a stronger Armor Aluminum Chassis. And last year, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review-specs-price-a-flagship-foldable-refined-131543810.html">Z Fold 4</a> brought a more durable main screen and a new adhesive designed to keep its factory-installed screen protector more firmly in place.</p><p>That last one is a biggie because after owning a <a href="https://gizmodo.com/life-with-a-foldable-phone-is-a-game-changer-with-one-t-1847439973">Z Fold 2</a> and a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/z-fold-3-long-term-durability-report-heres-what-samsung-still-cant-get-right-130053466.html">Z Fold 3</a>, I found that the screen protectors on both phones started bubbling after six to eight months. This weakness is a concern for anyone thinking about buying an $1,800 foldable phone –  especially when you consider that Samsung recommends that any repairs are done by an authorized service center. But as some who really likes foldable phones, I bought my own Z Fold 4 anyways and used it for a year. Here’s how well it held up.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="The front screen of a Galaxy Z Fold 4 after one year without a case. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/ac95ce30-3080-11ee-b7f7-37b73443223a" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>I should mention that I’ve never put the phone in a case or used any other protective accessories like skins or sleeves. Despite being naked the whole time, the phone has done a decent job of withstanding typical daily abuse. Sure, there are some scratches and bare spots where paint has flaked off and a few dents from the phone being dropped or falling out of a pocket. But that’s sort of expected for a phone with no additional protection and both the front and back glass still look great.</p><p>More importantly, its flexible main screen looks practically as good as the day I got it. The screen protector is still sitting flat, there are no dead pixels or other blemishes and the hinge feels as sturdy as ever. All told, I’m pretty impressed considering some of the problems I encountered with previous generations. That said, while the pre-installed screen protector hasn’t started bubbling, there is one tiny spot along the top edge at the crease where you can see that it has started to (ever so slightly) separate from the display. So far, this hasn’t caused any issues. However, if past experience is any indication, this could cause the screen protector to start bubbling down the line.</p><p>Still, after claiming it switched to a new, more sticky adhesive to the Z Fold 4’s factory-installed screen protector in place, at least on my phone, Samsung’s tweak seems to have had at least some effect. Is the problem completely solved? No, not quite. Remember, this is just a single example, and it’s hard to account for things like the milder winter we’ve had this year, and chillier weather sometimes caused issues for Z Fold and Z Flip owners.</p><p>Also, while my Z Fold 4 has aged rather nicely, the screen protector on Engadget’s executive editor Aaron Souppouris’ <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-4-review-camera-samples-specs-price-battery-life-170027529.html">Z Flip 4</a> has not fared nearly as well. He says the screen on his device was basically pristine for the first nine months. But after that, bubbles began to form and grew larger and larger until he removed the protector entirely and began using the phone with its naked flexible display.</p><p>It’s important to mention that Samsung instructs Z Flip and Z Fold owners not to use their devices without a screen protector. If you do remove it, you’re supposed to get it replaced as soon as possible. If you’re lucky, that can be as simple as finding a local Best Buy or uBreakiFix location and spending half an hour without your phone, and thankfully, Samsung offers one free screen protector replacement on both the Z Flip and Z Fold lines. Unfortunately, if you live in a remote area or just don’t have a nearby service center, you may need to rely on a mail-in repair, potentially leaving you without a phone for a couple of weeks or more. And for a lot of people, that’s not a reasonable option.</p><p>However, after talking to a number of Galaxy Z Flip and Z Fold owners who have removed their screen protectors, that seems to be merely a precaution. It’s totally possible to use a foldable phone without a screen protector just like you can on a regular handset. But given the more delicate nature of flexible displays (which are largely made of plastic instead of glass), the risk factor is higher. And with flexible screens costing a lot more to replace – up to <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f85e63cd-e13c-4f9d-991c-9fbaadede3ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Samsung+Electronics&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmODVlNjNjZC1lMTNjLTRmOWQtOTkxYy05ZmJhYWRlZGUzYWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2Ftc3VuZy5jb20vdXMvc3VwcG9ydC9jcmFja2VkLXNjcmVlbi1yZXBhaXIvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiZDMwYzcyNC05OWRhLTRhYTQtYTgxOS0wNzg2MjZhNTNhYTAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWP1jURFE6Tdvg9Q8WW6abauxtnIfXgizlY4SR0jR7Df&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fsupport%2Fcracked-screen-repair%2F">$599 depending on the specific model</a> – you don’t need a <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/galaxy-brain">galaxy brain</a>-sized noggin to understand why you might want to heed Samsung’s warnings. The counterpoint to that is because a foldable phone’s screen is protected by the rest of the device when closed, it’s only really vulnerable when you’re using it, as opposed to when it's simply resting in a pocket or bag.</p><figure><img alt="After one year, there are some scratches on my Galaxy Z Fold 4, but it still works and great and as is sturdy as ever. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/e6fea7e0-3080-11ee-bfc3-1ca49eb4cee9" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>So what’s the big takeaway? I think Samsung’s new adhesive has made a bit of a difference because, even in the case of Aaron’s Z Flip, it lasted longer than both of my previous Z Folds before the screen protector started bubbling. Even so, the screen protectors on Samsung’s foldable still require a bit more babying than a standard glass brick. This sort of fragility may be a deal-breaker for some, and understandably so. Thankfully, I live near multiple repair centers and I’m prepared to use my foldable without a screen protector – even though that’s not advised.&nbsp;</p><p>For me, the ability to have a screen that expands when I want to watch a movie or multitask is worth the slightly reduced durability. But either way, this is something you need to consider before buying a foldable phone. In some ways, it’s like owning a car with a convertible roof, because while they're a bit more delicate and costly to repair, there’s nothing like driving around with the top off – or in this case a phone that can transform into a small tablet at a moment’s notice.</p><p>Just remember to do the sensible thing and put your expensive foldable phone in a case.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-durability-report-has-samsung-finally-fixed-its-foldable-phones-biggest-weakness-133015335.html?src=rss

## DJI's Osmo Action 4 camera comes with a larger sensor and a higher price

<p>Less than a year after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dji-osmo-action-3-far-more-battery-life-fast-charging-and-a-spiffy-new-mount-120035233.html">launching the Action 3</a>, DJI has unveiled the Osmo Action 4 with an improved camera that makes it better in low light. It now packs a larger 1/1.3-inch sensor (the same one on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/djis-mavic-3-pro-comes-with-a-triple-camera-setup-130001265.html">Mavic 3 Pro</a>, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dji-mini-3-pro-review-130041928.html">Mini 3 Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dji-air-3-review-a-high-quality-zoom-adds-new-creative-options-130020261.html">Air 3</a> drones), compared to a 1/1.7-inch sensor on the previous model and the 1/1.9-inch sensor found on the GoPro Hero 11. It also introduces D-Log M, improving dynamic range significantly over the Action 3.&nbsp;</p><p>Not much else on the Action 4 has changed . It has the same 155-degree field of view and f/2.8 aperture. Video tops out at 4K 120p (10-bit HDR) in normal shooting mode. Photo resolution is actually lower than the previous model (3,648 x 2,736 compared to 4,000 x 3,000) and max 4:3 video quality is also down (3,840 x 2,880 instead of 4,096 x 3,072). Meanwhile, the GoPro Hero 11 can shoot 5.3K video at up to 60 fps, 4K at 120 fps and 2.7K at up to 240 fps.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Action 4's design is also identical to the Action 3, with a record button on top and power button on the side. The battery compartment/micro SD slot is on the right side and the USB-C port on the left (looking from the front). The battery is the same 1770 mWh model as before, with 150 minutes of recording time — and just 18 minutes of charging time to get the battery to 80 percent. A microSD card is required as the Action 4 has no internal storage.&nbsp;</p><p>It uses DJI's nifty magnetic locking system introduced with the last model that eliminates the need for a case to attach accessories. And as before, the Action 4 supports any accessories compatible with a GoPro mount. DJI has a number of its own accessories as well now, including the chest strap mount, helmet chin mount, 60m waterproof case, bike seat rail mount, neck mount, mini handlebar mount, the Osmo Action 360° Wrist Strap and a new a wrist-worn remote to control the Action 4.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="DJI's Osmo Action 4 camera comes with a larger sensor" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/d31b89f0-310c-11ee-9fee-f10dba032ff9" style="height: 1397px; width: 2400px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent for Engadget</div></figure><p>It's now waterproof down to 18m or 59 feet (2m more than before) or 60m (208 feet) with the waterproof case. As before, it comes with a 1.4-inch 320×320 front screen and 2.25-inch 360×640 rear display. Both top out at 750 nits, plenty bright even on sunny days. It comes with three mics and advanced wind noise reduction software that allows for impressive audio recording for such a small device.</p><p>It offers the latest version of DJI’s stabilization, Rocksteady 3.0 and Rocksteady 3.0+ to eliminate camera shake in all directions up to the maximum 4K/60fps. It also supports HorizonSteady, which keeps the Horizon level no matter how much you rotate the camera (2.7K max). Meanwhile, HorizonBalancing corrects tilt horizontally within ±45° and allows for stabilized recording at 4K/60fps.&nbsp;</p><p>To use the Action 4, you have to first activate it using DJI's smartphone app, so keep that in mind if you buy one and have a deadline. The app also lets you view and transfer footage, or livestream via WiFi.</p><p>So why did DJI release a camera so similar to the last model, less than a year later? Many reviews, including my own, docked the Action 3 for poor low-light image quality, with noticeable artifacts in situations like a forest on a cloudy day— something the GoPro 11 can handle with ease. I also noted that while the stabilization is good, it's not up to GoPro's standards, and DJI has updated that function as well.</p><p>The Action 4 offers some quality-of-life features like quick-switching between five custom modes, voice prompts that let you know about the current mode, voice control, an upgraded InvisiStick that digitally hides the selfie stick, external mic support and more. DJI also offers the The LightCut app that connects wirelessly to Action 4 via Wi-Fi, allowing for quick previews and auto-editing without the need to transfer footage from the camera.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="DJI's Osmo Action 4 camera comes with a larger sensor" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/d31e9730-310c-11ee-bd77-a6b3fbbd76c1" style="height: 1600px; width: 2400px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent for Engadget</div></figure><p>I had the Action 4 in my hands for a short while, mainly to test image quality with the new sensor. There's certainly a big improvement there — where the Action 3 showed pixelation and blocky artifacts in low light, the Action 4 largely eliminates those. That means it performs better in situations like cloudy mountain bike rides or underwater footage. Low-light capability is good overall, with noise well controlled for such a relatively small sensor. In that area, it now edges the GoPro Hero 11.&nbsp;</p><p>The RockSteady stabilization still leaves a bit to be desired compared to the Hero 11 and even the Insta360 X3 action camera, however. In a quick test with a mountain bike on a trail, it didn't provide the on-rails level of smoothness I've seen on rival models. If you don't mind slightly more zoom, though, RockSteady+ gets very close to those levels.</p><p>As before, the Action 4 could be a good option for content creators looking for high-quality footage, or folks who want to match their video with DJI's drones and other products. The price has gone up considerably over the $329 Action 3, though — it's now available for $399. That makes it a tough sell against the GoPro Hero 11, which now carries the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=06fa1f29-e83c-49e4-81a8-9732450da8a9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GoPro&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIwNmZhMWYyOS1lODNjLTQ5ZTQtODFhOC05NzMyNDUwZGE4YTkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9nb3Byby5jb20vZW4vdXMvbmV3cy9uZXctaGVybzExLWFuZC1zdWJzY3JpcHRpb24tcHJpY2UiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjRiNjY2NDM5LWQ0YzgtNDczNS05NTI0LTg5OWI3ZjA4YzliNCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAVSV6El1QarxCZlQFXd4n5s25k_BOxrURtDpFE4tCLCs&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fgopro.com%2Fen%2Fus%2Fnews%2Fnew-hero11-and-subscription-price">same price</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're starting from scratch, the Adventure Combo (above) is a far better deal at $499, giving you the camera plus three batteries, the Horizontal-Vertical ProtectiveFrame, a quick-release adapter mount, a mini quick-release mount, a curved adhesive base, two locking screws, a USB-C cable, the multifunction battery case, a 1.5 extension rod, an action lens hood and an anti-slip pad.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/djis-osmo-action-4-camera-comes-with-a-larger-sensor-and-a-higher-price-130027897.html?src=rss

## The Morning After: Microsoft starts selling replacement parts for Xbox gamepads

<p>Microsoft is dipping into the world of self-repair by offering <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-starts-selling-replacement-parts-for-xbox-gamepads-174023573.html">replacement parts</a> for Xbox gamepads, along with downloadable instructions and tutorial videos.

<p>One of the main selling points for Twitter Blue — now &quot;X Blue&quot; — when the service was first launched was that anybody on the platform willing to pay for it can get the once-coveted blue checkmark. Over the past months, though, subscribers have been <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/twitter-blue-shame-memes-1234628528/">getting shamed</a> for paying $8 a month or $84 a year for the service. Now as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/01/x-twitter-paid-users-hide-checkmarks/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> has noticed, the company has updated its <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-blue">support page</a> for X Blue with a new feature for members: The ability to hide the verified checkmark on their account.&nbsp;</p><p>Under the &quot;Profile customization&quot; section in account settings, subscribers will now find a new &quot;Hide your blue checkmark&quot; option that they can tick. By activating the feature, the badge will no longer show up on their profiles and next to their usernames on posts. However, the company warned that it could still show up in some places and that some features may not be available to them while their checkmark is hidden. It didn't say which features will become inaccessible, but Twitter has rolled out a number of changes made specifically for paying users since Elon Musk took over.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-increases-paid-users-tweet-limit-to-10000-characters-041452623.html">increased</a> paid users' post limit to 25,000 characters and is even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-is-working-on-new-publishing-tools-for-long-form-articles-185302573.html">working on new tools</a> to publish long-form content.

It announced in July that it will limit the number of DMs non-paying users can send in an effort to limit spam, and it previously <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-puts-strict-cap-on-how-many-tweets-users-can-read-each-day-182623928.html">put a strict cap</a> on how many tweets a day a user can see due to &quot;extreme levels of data scraping.&quot; While the restriction was temporary, unverified accounts were initially limited to 600 posts daily.&nbsp;</p><p>App developer Alessandro Paluzzi first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-may-let-you-hide-the-fact-you-pay-to-use-twitter-160015039.html">spotted</a> the capability to hide checkmarks in March.

By activating the feature, the badge will no longer show up on their profiles and next to their usernames on posts. However, the company warned that it could still show up in some places and that some features may not be available to them while their checkmark is hidden. It didn't say which features will become inaccessible, but Twitter has rolled out a number of changes made specifically for paying users since Elon Musk took over.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-increases-paid-users-tweet-limit-to-10000-characters-041452623.html">increased</a> paid users' post limit to 25,000 characters and is even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-is-working-on-new-publishing-tools-for-long-form-articles-185302573.html">working on new tools</a> to publish long-form content. The website has also expanded their video limit to 3 hours. Meanwhile, the social network has become less and less attractive for free users. It announced in July that it will limit the number of DMs non-paying users can send in an effort to limit spam, and it previously <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-puts-strict-cap-on-how-many-tweets-users-can-read-each-day-182623928.html">put a strict cap</a> on how many tweets a day a user can see due to &quot;extreme levels of data scraping.&quot; While the restriction was temporary, unverified accounts were initially limited to 600 posts daily.&nbsp;</p><p>App developer Alessandro Paluzzi first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-may-let-you-hide-the-fact-you-pay-to-use-twitter-160015039.html">spotted</a> the capability to hide checkmarks in March. Based on the screenshots Paluzzi shared, the verification process will remain the same, with users being required to submit a government ID to authenticate their identities. It now simply won't be obvious at first glance that someone's paying for X Blue.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/x-blue-formerly-twitter-blue-subscribers-can-now-hide-their-checkmarks-110229428.html?src=rss

<p>Canon has just <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=dcf1e3ab-a19e-4b98-887f-4f574310d563&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Canon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJkY2YxZTNhYi1hMTllLTRiOTgtODg3Zi00ZjU3NDMxMGQ1NjMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudXNhLmNhbm9uLmNvbS9zaG9wL3AvbXMtNTAwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2NjkxZTFiOC04NWI5LTQ0MjUtODA5Ny1hYmY0NTIwMTYwMjkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARpE77yuoF2zUC8s5iIyiErewoRJx7bhn7X5uVflzjiP&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usa.canon.com%2Fshop%2Fp%2Fms-500">unveiled the MS-500</a>, an unusual model that's one of the most sensitive non-infrared cameras ever developed. It uses the highest-resolution <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-9995-fuell-fllow-electric-motorcycle-is-available-for-pre-order-today-220016821.html">1-inch SPAD</a> (Single-photon avalanche diode) sensor yet (3.2 megapixels), and an interchangeable lens mount that allows clear color shooting in light as low as 0.001 lux, according to Canon — less than a clear moonless sky.&nbsp;</p><p>The MS-500 uses Canon's B4 mount that supports its broadcast zoom lenses, and carries a price of over $25,000 for the body only. It's designed to work in "areas with extremely high-security levels, such as seaports, public infrastructure facilities, and national borders," the company said. When married with Canon's ultra-telephoto broadcast lenses, it can capture "clear color videos of subjects at a distance of several miles, even at night." It also uses special picture profiles to reduce noise caused by atmospheric disturbances over long distances.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Canon's new 'SPAD' camera can take high-quality color pictures with almost no light" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/49b60050-3116-11ee-bfaa-87338539222a" style="height: 1400px; width: 1750px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Canon</div></figure><p>So why should you care about a $25,000+ security camera? The answer is in that SPAD sensor, which holds promise for future consumer and professional imaging. It uses a technology called photo counting, which tracks light particles entering a pixel, magnifies them one million times, and converts them to a digital signal. Every single photon is counted, which eliminates the introduction of any noise — "a key advantage of SPAD sensors," Canon noted.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/canons-new-security-focused-spad-camera-can-capture-color-video-in-complete-darkness-095516159.html?src=rss

<p>Any gaming company looking to copy a competitor's hit might want to think twice. Nintendo's <em>The Last Hope: Dead Zone Survival</em> has officially been removed from the Switch e-shop due to its overt similarities to Naughty Dog's hit, <em>The Last of Us</em>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-knock-off-removed-from-nintendo-eshop-as-sony-stakes-copyright-claim">Victoria Kennedy reported at <em>Eurogamer</em></a>. Sony (which owns Naughty Dog) issued a copyright claim against the game just over a month after its release, a move that has not only taken it off the market but also scrubbed YouTube of its trailer.</p><p><em>The Last Hope</em> isn't likely to be missed as the game didn't exactly garner good reviews, with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-the-last-hope-on-switch-the-worst-game-ever-reviewed"><em>Digital Foundry</em></a> saying it was &quot;the worst game we've ever tested&quot; and <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/switch-last-us-clone-vanished-191000315.html"><em>Yahoo</em></a> simply calling it &quot;horrible-looking.&quot; Widespread comparisons to <em>The Last of Us</em> were immediately made upon the game's release, including the similarities between the high-quality Ellie and <em>The Last Hope</em>'s blurry (but almost identically styled) Eva. Yeah, it really didn't do itself any favors.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If, for some reason, you had a strong affinity for the game, it's still available for anyone who previously downloaded it. Otherwise, a visit to its page on Nintendo's e-shop will bring you an error message. If you had avoided the knockoff, well, this is the last time you ever have to think about it.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-pulls-the-last-of-us-clone-from-its-eshop-following-copyright-claim-092558958.html?src=rss

## AI-enabled brain implant helps patient regain feeling and movement

<p>Keith Thomas from New York was involved in a driving accident back in 2020 that injured his <a href="https://www.engadget.com/swiss-researchers-help-a-spinal-injury-patient-to-walk-more-naturally-using-a-wireless-bci-151542965.html">spine's</a> C4 and C5 vertebrae, leading to a total loss in feeling and movement from the chest down. Recently, though, Thomas had been able to move his arm at will and feel his sister hold his hand, thanks to the AI brain implant technology <a href="https://www.northwell.edu/feinstein-sub/news/the-latest/bioelectronic-medicine-researchers-restore-feeling-lasting-movement-in-man-living-with-quadriplegia">developed by</a> the Northwell Health's Feinstein Institute of Bioelectronic Medicine.&nbsp;</p><p>The research team first <a href="https://www.popsci.com/technology/double-neural-bypass-surgery-ai/">spent months</a> mapping his brain with MRIs to pinpoint the exact parts of his brain responsible for arm movements and the sense of touch in his hands. Then, four months ago, surgeons performed a 15-hour procedure to implant microchips into his brain — Thomas was even awake for some parts so he could tell them what sensations he was feeling in his hand as they probed parts of the organ.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While the microchips are inside his body, the team also installed external ports on top of his head. Those ports connect to a computer with the artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms that the team developed to interpret his thoughts and turn them into action. The researchers call this approach &quot;thought-driven therapy,&quot; because it all starts with the patient's intentions. If he thinks of wanting to move his hand, for instance, his brain implant sends signals to the computer, which then sends signals to the electrode patches on his spine and hand muscles in order to stimulate movement. They attached sensors to his fingertips and palms, as well, to stimulate sensation.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks to this system, he was able to move his arm at will and feel his sister holding his hand in the lab. While he needed to be attached to the computer for those milestones, the researchers say Thomas has shown signs of recovery even when the system is off. His arm strength has apparently &quot;more than doubled&quot; since the study began, and his forearm and wrist could now feel some new sensations. If all goes well, the team's thought-driven therapy could help him regain more of his sense of touch and mobility.&nbsp;</p><p>While the approach has a ways to go, the team behind it is hopeful that it could change the lives of people living with paralysis. Chad Bouton, the technology's developer and the principal investigator of the clinical trial, said:</p><p>&quot;This is the first time the brain, body and spinal cord have been linked together electronically in a paralyzed human to restore lasting movement and sensation. When the study participant thinks about moving his arm or hand, we ‘supercharge’ his spinal cord and stimulate his brain and muscles to help rebuild connections, provide sensory feedback, and promote recovery. This type of thought-driven therapy is a game-changer. Our goal is to use this technology one day to give people living with paralysis the ability to live fuller, more independent lives.&quot;</p><div id="480cb133fccb467180168db858b1f990"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai-enabled-brain-implant-helps-patient-regain-feeling-and-movement-073711090.html?src=rss

<p>Earlier this year, EA said that <em>Star Wars: Jedi Survivor</em> would only come out on the <a href="https://gamerant.com/star-wars-jedi-survivor-ps4-xbox-one/">latest PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles</a> in order to take advantage of the latest tech on those consoles. The developer has now changed its tune, however, announcing in an earnings call that the title will come to PS4 and Xbox One consoles after all, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/1/23816311/star-wars-jedi-survivor-ps4-xbox-one"><em>The Verge</em></a> has reported.</p><p>&quot;Thanks to the strength of this legendary franchise and community demand, our development team has committed to bringing this Jedi experience to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,&quot; said EA CEO Andrew Wilson. Jedi Survivor came out on PC, Xbox Series X/S and PS5 in April, but there's no firm date for release on the last-gen consoles.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Jedi: Survivor</em>, a direct sequel to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-wars-jedi-survivor-trailer-gameplay-release-date-trailer-022159717.html"><em>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</em></a><em>,</em> was the headliner in Engadget’s  article about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-wars-jedi-survivor-and-the-year-of-disappointing-pc-ports-141551209.html">disappointing PC ports</a> earlier this year.

## TweetDeck's new name is 'XPro'

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-launches-new-tweetdeck-as-the-old-version-breaks-down-231939160.html">TweetDeck</a> has <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/08/01/tweetdeck-xpro/">started showing signs</a> that it will not escape Twitter's massive rebranding unscathed. If you take a look at the tool's landing page while logged out, you'll see "XPro" on the upper left corner of the website, indicating its new name. That's pretty much it at the moment, though — the page still shows the iconic Twitter bird logo, and it still calls TweetDeck a "powerful, real-time tool for people who live on Twitter." And, yes, its URL is still https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/ in the same way Twitter's (sorry, we mean X's) URL is https://twitter.com/.&nbsp;</p><p>Twitter's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-is-rebranding-twitter-to-x-and-killing-the-bird-logo-165944573.html">rebranding to "X"</a> hit us overnight quite literally in July, with Elon Musk announcing the change in a tweet and then, reportedly, emailing his employees about it afterward. The social network started implementing changes after that by swapping out the Twitter bird with a generic-looking "X" logo, which will apparently "<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1683947705876328450">evolve over time,</a>" as well as renaming tweets to "posts" and retweets to "reposts." Google and Apple both relisted the social network's app as "X" on the Play Store and the App Store, respectively, by the end of July.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The move, while sudden, perhaps didn't come as a surprise for those who've followed Musk's career over the years. Musk is known for favoring the "X" branding and had <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2023/07/25/elon-musk-paypal-twitter-x-rebrand/">wanted to rename PayPal</a> to X.com before he was ousted as CEO. The executive also renamed Twitter's parent company to X Corp. He said the social network's new name will help it branch out and become an "everything app" with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-ceo-teases-banking-and-payment-plans-in-memo-about-x-rebrand-175218664.html">payments and banking features</a>. But critics are doubting the rebranding's success, with some <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90927580/elon-musk-twitter-rebrand-x-bad-idea">calling it</a> "the dumbest thing [Musk has] done since taking over" and something that now makes the company <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/marcuscollins/2023/07/30/the-real-lesson-to-be-learned-from-twitters-rebrand/?sh=14480ee41fd2">less identifiable</a> and less <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=7212db91-cd64-4c1b-ab0d-1d1c998f089e&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=time&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI3MjEyZGI5MS1jZDY0LTRjMWItYWIwZC0xZDFjOTk4ZjA4OWUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly90aW1lLmNvbS82Mjk3MzAzL3R3aXR0ZXIteC1yZWJyYW5kLWNvc3QvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIxYmI0YWQ3OS1mZWVjLTRjYjktOWMzYi1jMGE2ODNkMjBiNWYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAeowi3e0WO_nPI2h5ZbvO-0WSm95P5ADYk1ct_7CjGd7&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F6297303%2Ftwitter-x-rebrand-cost%2F">valuable</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the criticisms, the erasure of the Twitter brand is now well underway. TweetDeck will not remain TweetDeck for very long, and it also won't be free to use in the near future. The company has previously noted that it will be locked behind a paywall and will be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-launches-new-tweetdeck-as-the-old-version-breaks-down-231939160.html">exclusively available to Blue</a> subscribers.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/tweetdecks-new-name-is-xpro-052613174.html?src=rss
