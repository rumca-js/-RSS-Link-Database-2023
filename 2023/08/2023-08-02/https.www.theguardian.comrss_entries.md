<p>Russia attacks Izmail port, sending food prices higher; Ukrainians in Russian-occupied territory being forced to assume Russian citizenship, study finds</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia+ukraine">See all our Russia-Ukraine war coverage</a></li></ul><p><strong>Russia has attacked Ukraine’s main inland port across the Danube River from Romania,</strong> sending global food prices higher as it ramps up its use of force to prevent Ukraine from exporting grain. The attacks on Wednesday destroyed buildings in Izmail and halted ships as they prepared to arrive there to load up with Ukrainian grain in defiance of a de-facto blockade of Ukraine’s Black Sea ports that Russia reimposed in mid-July. The Izmail port has since served as the main alternative route out of Ukraine for grain exports. Kyiv reportedly said the attacks damaged 40,000 tonnes of food products.</p><p><strong>The European Union has warned developing countries that Russia is offering cheap grain “to create new dependencies by exacerbating economic vulnerabilities and global food insecurity”</strong>, according to a letter seen by Reuters on Wednesday. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, wrote to developing and Group of 20 countries on Monday to urge them to speak “with a clear and unified voice” to push Moscow to return to a deal that allowed the safe Black Sea export of Ukraine grain and to stop targeting Ukraine’s agricultural infrastructure.</p><p><strong>The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said Russia’s attacks on port infrastructure show Moscow is intent on creating a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/02/odesa-region-ports-hit-in-apparent-russian-bid-to-kill-off-grain-deal">“global catastrophe”</a></strong> with a crisis in food markets, prices and supplies. “For the Russian state, this is not just a battle against our freedom and against our country,” Zelenskiy said on Wednesday in his nightly video address. “Moscow is waging a battle for a global catastrophe. In their madness, they need world food markets to collapse, they need a price crisis, they need disruptions in supplies.”</p><p><strong>Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, urged Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, to reopen talks on the failed Black Sea grain deal</strong> he helped broker last year.</p><p><strong>More than 10 Russian drones were downed in an overnight attack on Kyiv,</strong> Ukrainian officials said early on Wednesday. “Groups of drones entered Kyiv simultaneously from several directions. However, all air targets – more than 10 unmanned aerial vehicles – were detected and destroyed in time by the forces and means of air defense,” said Sergiy Popko, head of the Kyiv city military administration.</p><p><strong>Zelenskiy has said he hoped a Ukraine “peace summit” could be held this autumn,</strong> and that this week’s talks in Saudi Arabia were a stepping stone towards that goal. He told Ukrainian diplomats on Wednesday in a speech published on the president’s website that almost 40 countries would be represented at the meeting in Jeddah on Saturday and Sunday.</p><p><strong>Ukrainians living in Russian-occupied territory are being forced to assume Russian citizenship or face harsh retaliation,</strong> including possible deportation or detention, US-backed research published on Wednesday said. Yale University researchers said that as part of a plan by Moscow to assert authority over Ukrainians, residents of the Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions were being targeted by a systematic effort to strip them of Ukrainian identity.</p><p><strong>The Polish deputy foreign minister, Pawel Jabłoński, said relations with Ukraine had “not been the best” lately </strong>after an official was criticised by Kyiv after suggesting the embattled nation had been ungrateful despite the level of support it had received.</p><p><strong>Poland adopted an amended version of a panel to investigate “Russian influence”</strong> after an avalanche of EU and US criticism of the move, widely seen as targeting the opposition.</p><p><strong>Local militia groups in two Russian regions bordering Ukraine – Belgorod and Kursk – were provided with weapons</strong> to defend their territory from Ukrainian attacks, according to local officials.</p><p><strong>Pope Francis urged Europe to find “courageous courses of peace” to end the war in Ukraine.</strong> He said: “Where are you sailing, if you are not showing the world paths of peace, creative ways for bringing an end to the war in Ukraine?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/03/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-526-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>

Mr Trump already faces multiple criminal charges relating to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/06/09/us/trump-indictment-document-annotated.html" title="">retention</a> of classified national security documents and the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-arraignment-hush-money-81225510ef7638494852816878f612f0" title="">payment</a> of hush money to a porn star.

A bipartisan congressional <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/19/trump-attempt-coup-jan-6-panel-executive-summary" title="">committee</a> report last year came to similar conclusions and provides much of the basis for the charges.

Andrew Mitchell has this week released a <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/41098/documents/200208/default/" title="">Foreign Office analysis</a> that describes the “severe” consequences of the government’s reduced aid spending. In Yemen, half a million women and children will not receive healthcare and “fewer preventable deaths will be avoided”. In Somalia, a programme to counter female genital mutilation may be deferred or dropped altogether. Across Africa, there will be far more unsafe abortions and women dying in childbirth.</p><p>This <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/aug/02/womens-health-at-risk-from-uk-aid-cuts-foreign-office-warned" title="">widespread devastation</a> is civil servants’ assessment of the impact from just one year of cuts to aid spending, yet the UK is into its fourth straight year of reduced development, during a period that has encompassed a global pandemic, a dire shortage of Covid vaccines, a worldwide inflation shock and a violent invasion of Ukraine that has disrupted international supplies of grain and oil.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/02/the-guardian-view-on-uk-aid-spending-slashed-budgets-unethical-compromises">Continue reading...</a>

## Martin Delaney: ‘Renford Rejects was a massive part of people’s childhood’

<p>The actor reflects on appearing in the cult 1990s children’s TV show about a five-a-side team made up of outcasts and oddballs</p><p>“That’s Priscilla’s hatch!” Martin Delaney says, pointing excitedly to the square hole in the wall. We’re at Morty &amp; Bob’s, a diner-come-bar in north London that is proving to be the perfect setting for this interview given it used to be Graceland, the cafe that appeared prominently in Renford Rejects, the cult children’s TV show from the late 1990s. The venue has changed a lot since then but one feature remains and Delaney is understandably delighted about that.</p><p>For he played Jason Summerbee, captain of the Rejects, a fictitious five-a-side team, from a fictitious area, made up of outcasts and oddballs. Alongside Jason there was Ben Philips, Bruno Di Gradi, Ronnie Supra and Robin Walker, and their every kick was documented by wannabe sports presenter Vinnie Rodrigues and coached by Stewart Jackson, who was the best player of the lot but couldn’t play having been put in crutches by the show’s arch-villain, Terry ‘The Terminator’ Stoker. And the Rejects - they were called Renford Rovers only for Stoker to change their name on their registration form for the Renford Youth League - hung out at Graceland, which was owned by Elvis fanatic Eddie McAvoy and his suitably-named, long-suffering wife Priscilla, who viewers never saw and only heard.

But I will do so again, because my<strong> </strong>mood darkens every time I visit my local big supermarket. I first honoured the place with my business about 20 years ago. Back then there were about two dozen staffed checkouts, in those days of innocence before the death march of progress gathered pace. A handful of self-checkouts appeared; a handful of human ones vanished. At first we saw them as harmless novelties. They were never all in operation, and those that were rarely worked properly. The whole caper seemed to involve as many staff supervising machines as could have been operating a battery of proper tills. But we indulged the management, bless them. They’ve got to try these things, haven’t they?</p><p>Then came more of them, and ever fewer human tills. A zero-sum game. It remained the case that some machines were out of action and the remainder invariably had a glitch in store for you.

<p>Donald Trump’s frantic, cynical and preposterous attempts to hang on to power after losing the 2020 election were a dark moment in US history</p><p>In the 1976 political drama <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QodGxD19_as">All the President’s Men</a>, Robert Redford’s Bob Woodward meets the secretive FBI source, Deep Throat, in a parking garage to ask him what he knows about the Watergate break-in. Deep Throat – in real life, the FBI deputy director Mark Felt – is ominous and taciturn, refusing to say all that he knows. “I have to do this my way,” he tells Redford. “You tell me what you know, and I’ll confirm.” But he offers a blunt assessment of the inner workings of the Nixon administration. “Forget the myths that the media has created about the White House,” Deep Throat tells Woodward. “The truth is these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.”</p><p>Few moments in history, including the Watergate scandal, have done so much to puncture the dignified mystique of American government as Donald Trump’s frantic, cynical and preposterous attempts to hang on to power after losing the 2020 election. The indictment against him related that effort, unsealed on Tuesday by the office of special counsel Jack Smith, charges Trump with engaging in three conspiracies: to defraud the United States in seeking to overturn the election, to obstruct the government in seeking to derail the January 6 proceedings, and perhaps most meaningfully, to deprive American voters of their right to have their votes counted. The charges are serious; the violence was deadly. But every one of the indictment’s 45 pages evokes Deep Throat’s words: these are not very bright guys.</p><p>Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/02/trump-indictment-jan-6-election-danger">Continue reading...</a>

Sign up now!</a></p><p>Sometimes we – the MSM (Mainstream Mailouts) – get too wrapped up in tactics and politics to remember what football is generally about: agony and ecstasy. Italy and South Africa kindly reminded us of these two polar-opposite emotions at the World Cup in Wellington on Wednesday. It was a game that had most things: a penalty, VAR drama, a late winner … and even a comical own goal via the unfortunate Benedetta Orsi. The Italian defender blindly passed the ball backwards, neglecting to realise her goalkeeper Francesca Durante wasn’t where she thought she would be, forcing both to helplessly watch as the ball trickled over the line to level the group-stage decider at 1-1. However, far worse was to come for Italy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/02/football-daily-email-south-africa-italy-agony-and-ecstasy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘This meeting place, under a bridge over the Nile, was a great place to watch the world go by. But many people have now fled the city – and places like this sit empty’</p><p>I moved to Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, at the age of five, and instantly fell in love with the river. The Nile snakes through the city, offering one of very few public places to escape the sweltering heat. It was always where I felt happiest as a child, and now as an adult.</p><p>The Halfaya Bridge, pictured here, is one of the newer bridges in the city. It connects two of the capital’s three main neighbourhoods: Omdurman, where I grew up and still live, and Bahri, to the east of the Nile. Under the bridge is a little tea shop, a common sight. It’s the perfect place to pause, relax, watch the world go by and catch the breeze blowing in over the water. The river is treated like a public space in Khartoum. The various classes and communities that make up the city all come here to chat and look out over the Nile. It’s a place where people come together in a city that can otherwise feel divided.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/aug/02/taking-tea-in-khartoum-ala-kheir-my-best-shot">Continue reading...</a>

<p>He didn’t intend to be an actor, but Cloud created one of the show’s most compelling characters. Following his death, a third season would be impossible without his grounding presence</p><p>In its short existence, Euphoria – Sam Levinson’s wild, often gruesome HBO melodrama about wayward teens in suburban California – has been memed and mocked, often for its outlandish plot elements and self-indulgent tone. It also has ardent defenders, who love its gossipy salaciousness and the way it treats teen emotions – hate, heartbreak, lust, apathy, alienation – with fundamental earnestness and sincerity. Key to this spirit is the show’s talented cast, who are adept at capturing the anxiety and profound awkwardness of youth. Few were better at that than Angus Cloud.</p><p>The actor, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/31/angus-cloud-euphoria-dies-aged-25">who died </a>on 31 July, aged 25, played the mumbling, sweet drug dealer Fezco and built one of Euphoria’s most compelling characters out of half-sentences and dazed stares. As one of the key foils to Zendaya’s drug addict Rue, Cloud was required to toe a constant line between compassion and exasperation without turning his character into a caricature. In a show known for its larger-than-life aesthetic and soap-operatic plotting, Fezco became an unusual fount of realism. Even as his character became embroiled in the kind of dealers-vs-feds sub-plot that seemed as if it was lifted straight from a cop show, Cloud kept a tight grip on his character’s grace and empathetic nature.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/aug/02/words-are-not-enough-to-describe-the-infinite-beauty-the-astonishing-talent-of-euphoria-angus-cloud">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The actor Angus Cloud, who died this week, struggled “intensely” after his father’s death. Collectively, we need to reckon with how we support the bereaved</p><p>The day after my dad’s funeral, in August 2020, I got a text from my manager asking when I was coming back to work. I stared at my phone and felt bile rise in my throat. They weren’t being intentionally callous. In fact, my manager had been supportive and empathic throughout my dad’s short illness. But my two weeks of discretionary bereavement leave were up. My choice was to go back to the office or use up my remaining holiday allowance. Something inside me threatened to snap.</p><p>I wasn’t ready to go back to work. I wasn’t a functioning human at that point: I had severe brain fog, I felt numb and apathetic about everything, I was awake all night and lethargic during the day, I was barely eating. There were hours or full days when I physically could not stop crying. If you described these symptoms to a medical professional, they would probably diagnose acute mental illness, sign you off work, and prescribe medication or talking therapy. But grief is different. Despite the fact that it is a universal human experience, something we all have to go through at some point in our lives, grief is still not taken seriously enough.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/02/angus-cloud-father-died-grief-bereaved">Continue reading...</a>

Sign up here</a></strong></p><p>This week brings a preposterously generous gift for lovers of timesink role-playing games: Larian Studios’s Baldur’s Gate 3. Depending on your level of engagement with Dungeon and Dragons-inspired RPGs, you will know it either as the unlikely and long-awaited follow-up to 2000’s Baldur’s Gate 2 – one of the great computer RPGs of its era – or as the game where you can <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23793804/baldurs-gate-3-halsin-bear-sex-scene-memes-romance">have sex with a bear</a>.</p><p>Look, technically it’s not a bear – it’s a shapeshifting druid in bear form. But still, the scene inevitably went viral when Larian showed it off during a livestream last month. It is the tip of the iceberg: you can romance pretty much any available character in this role-playing game, or several of them at once. You can try to steal almost anything, or throw it at an enemy as a makeshift weapon. You can be good, or creatively, grotesquely evil. It is indicative of Larian’s approach to the genre, which is that if the player can imagine it and it can be determined by a dice roll, you should be able to do it. The studio wants to capture some of the unpredictable, anarchic spirit that players of real-life D&amp;D adore about their hobby.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/aug/02/pushing-buttons-baldurs-gate-3">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From the Gutenberg press to the word processor, a detailed trawl through the history of print offers lessons for the digital age</p><p>The Gutenberg Parenthesis is a term coined by Danish scholar Lars Ole Sauerberg, who proposed that the history of literary culture as we had hitherto known it – the 500-plus years from the invention of Johannes Gutenberg’s printing press in the mid-15th century until around the turn of the millennium – would come to be regarded as a mere blip. Digital technology would transform our cultural institutions by undermining their core foundation: the intellectual property and moral authority bound up in individual authorship. The future of knowledge production would be collective and collaborative – entailing, in essence, a return to the oral tradition of the world before print.</p><p>In The Gutenberg Parenthesis, US journalist Jeff Jarvis considers this thesis and its possible implications. He is anxious that we should retain what was good and useful about analog-era gatekeeping structures, which played an important role in “recommending quality, certifying fact, supporting creativity. What must we create to replace these functions?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/02/the-gutenberg-parenthesis-the-age-of-print-and-its-lessons-for-the-age-of-the-internet-by-jeff-jarvis-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Long after their 90s heyday, bands such as Codeine and Duster are finding new audiences in thrall to their slow, sad vision of guitar music. Veterans explain the scene’s angst and idealism</p><p>‘We were not trying to make people dance, we were not trying to ‘rock’ – we were trying to make things that were beautiful,” says Dean Wareham, who formed Galaxie 500 in Boston in 1987 with Naomi Yang and Damon Krukowski. Their music, Wareham explains, was “slower, more introspective” than most underground rock in America during the late 80s, a scene defined by distortion, volume and velocity, dominated by hardcore punks, proto-grungers and the nihilistic fans of the caustic subgenre entitled pigfuck. To stand apart was to invite pushback: Wareham recalls one pigfuck aficionado giving the band the finger and screaming “Faggot!” throughout their first Chicago gig until he was ejected.</p><p>But <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/mar/11/galaxie-500-cd-review">Galaxie 500</a> held their nerve. Tracks like 1988 debut single <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEwouUjDTTE">Tugboat</a> are masterpieces of longing, and won a cult following on both sides of the Atlantic before internal frictions ran the band aground in 1991. “After working in a somewhat restrictive format, it was time to try something else,” says Wareham (who went on to form urbane indie-rockers Luna).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/02/glacial-pleasures-of-slowcore-codeine-duster">Continue reading...</a>

## Open Up by Thomas Morris review – the longing to belong

<p>Distant dads, shy lads and a seahorse are among the solitary figures in these five nuanced stories</p><p>Thomas Morris’s second collection of short stories, the successor volume to his acclaimed debut <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/14/we-dont-know-what-were-doing-thomas-morris-review">We Don’t Know What We’re Doing</a>, presents the reader with five studies of the longing to belong. A boy goes to his first Wales football game with his father, who no longer lives with him and his mum, in the year that Wales reach the semi-finals of the Euros and the boy and his mother lose their home. A seahorse tries to fit the lessons his father has taught him on to his own life, as he navigates a world that’s satisfyingly the inverse of our own, full of pregnant dads and absent mums. A frustrated office worker stuck in a dead-end job asks out his best friend by text, having run out of potential matches on Tinder; a young man travels round Croatia with his girlfriend, while trying to break out of the psychological isolation he blames on his father; and another goes to a backstreet dentist to get his teeth sharpened so he looks like a vampire, while his mother barely leaves the house after the death of her husband. The astute reader will have already discerned the presence of certain themes and archetypes achingly familiar to readers of fiction – this is a book filled with shy boys, distant dads, and men not able to connect with women.</p><p>The requirement of a writer choosing to work with such familiar material is that they do it very well, and this is what Morris has achieved. He articulates loneliness and the desire to feel connected to someone with great delicacy, subtly highlighting the early traumas that might make connection difficult. His work is interested in adolescence; moments in the development of his characters’ lives when something caused them to split off from the pack, or at least feel that they had done so, so that now their lives strike them as a kind of dream. The boy in the story Wales believes he can enter into other worlds, other realities (what child of divorce doesn’t?). The seahorse father in Aberkariad sticks doggedly to the story that his partner will come back to him one day, even though he knows it not to be true. The man in Little Wizard is struck by the feeling that “his hands weren’t his own”; the young man in Passenger is haunted by the idea that he’s not “the real him” now, that the past is the real world, and everything else is a kind of obscuring of it. For the protagonist of Birthday Teeth, “my own past feels like a fiction, like something that didn’t really happen to me”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/02/open-up-by-thomas-morris-review-the-longing-to-belong">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Fitch downgrade takes markets by surprise; housebuilder Taylor Wimpey flags affordability concerns after sales slump</p><p>Higher numbers of people are missing payments for essential bills including for energy, water or council tax, according to a consumer group, as the <a href="https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/cost-of-living-crisis">cost of living crisis </a>continues to hurt household finances.</p><p>Which?’s consumer insight tracker found that 2.4m UK households missed or defaulted on essential payments including for housing, loans or credit cards in the month to 13 July, returning to the high levels seen last winter.</p><p>When S&amp;P downgraded the US credit rating in August 2011 it triggered a sharp selloff in risk assets and boosted safe haven demand for US Treasuries. The US dollar reaction was more muted. On this occasion we are expecting the immediate market reaction to be relatively more modest. The timing of the downgrade was somewhat surprising although Fitch did warn back in May that they were weighing up lowering the credit rating.</p><p>The announcement sheds more light on the health of the US public finances which we have already highlighted as a negative structural factor for US dollar performance over the medium to long-term. The US Treasury just announced on Monday that it has increased the net borrowing estimate for Q3 to $1 trillion which is well above the $733 billion it had predicted back in May. The Treasury is due to preview its quarterly financing plans later today.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/aug/02/markets-fall--us-credit-downgrade-taylor-wimpey-warns-rising-interest-rates-weakened-housing-market">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Louis-Dreyfus and Tobias Menzies lead grownup story whose bittersweet punchlines stress the bitter component</p><p>A hot button issue in recent cinema criticism – well, warm button anyway – is the eradication of intelligent mid-budget dramas in the Hollywood system. Making decently acted, well-written, approachable, middle to upper-middlebrow movies with three or four grownup leads for theatrical release used to be an honourable tradition. Now it’s getting squeezed out by franchise products, and maybe because producers dread an eye-rolling comment of “first world problems” at the pitch meeting.</p><p>But writer-director Nicole Holofcener is keeping the flag flying with her shrewd, talky movies about middle-aged anxiety. I wasn’t a fan of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/may/26/2">Friends With Money</a>, but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/oct/17/enough-said-review">Enough Said</a>, with Julia Louis-Dreyfus and the late James Gandolfini, was a terrific romantic comedy. Now there is You Hurt My Feelings, a smart, if faintly exhausting comedy about midlife disillusionment with a lot of bitter in the bittersweet. Articulate, depressed, middle-aged people in New York with classy jobs, impossible aged parents and tricky twentysomething kids, have chance encounters in stores and on the streets and later confide tensely to each other about the resulting conversations. It’s very much in the template that Woody Allen and Nora Ephron made famous, but with winces and groans where the laughs would otherwise go.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/02/you-hurt-my-feelings-review-middlebrow-marital-comedy-julia-louis-dreyfus-and-tobias-menzies-">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Most Indian profanities are profoundly sexist, and so deeply ingrained that even women use curses that humiliate their sisters. Let’s find a way to express anger without misogyny</p><p>I was shocked. Scrolling through my Twitter feed, I stopped at an exchange between a women’s rights activist I know and a troll in which the activist, someone who often talked to me about the gendered nature of our cuss words responded using <em>maa-behen ki gaali</em> (misogynistic abuse).</p><p>My mind went round and round, trying to decipher if this was hypocrisy or an unconscious expression of rage. I settled for the latter, as gendered slurs are so embedded in our everyday speech that we use them (mostly in angry or in stresss) without stopping to think.

## Remembering the Slip: the Manhattan street that birthed a generation of artists – then was demolished

<p>The tiny downtown passage, where artists burned pallets for warmth, was home to Ellsworth Kelly and Agnes Martin</p><p>The cover of Prudence Peiffer’s new book, The Slip, features the kind of photograph New York City dreams are made of. In the 1958 shot, taken by Hans Namuth, a bohemian-looking group – many of whom would later become giants of American art – smoke and sip coffee on a Manhattan roof, a greyscale higgle-piggle of apartment blocks and art nouveau buildings as their backdrop. They include Ellsworth Kelly, Agnes Martin, Robert Indiana and Jack Youngerman, along with Delphine Seyrig, the Lebanese-French actor, and Seyrig and Youngerman’s blond toddler son, Duncan.</p><p>The photograph was taken on the roof of 3–5 Coenties Slip, a warehouse in a small street in Manhattan’s Financial District. Artists lived in the Slip for just over a decade, from the late 1950s to the late 1960s, very cheaply and in most cases illegally, in warehouses that had once served the maritime industry. During that time, Peiffer argues, the work they produced changed American art for ever.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/01/the-slip-new-york-agnes-martin-ellsworth-kelly">Continue reading...</a>

Her biographer revels in the biggest show of Arbus work ever, combining rare, unseen and famous images</p><p>Diane Arbus was drawn to people who reminded her of important figures in her life, such as her flamboyant maternal grandmother or her lover Marvin Israel. More generally, she was fascinated to the point of obsession by the discrepancy between who we are and how we want to be seen – what she called “the gap between intention and effect”. Her list of favourite subjects includes female impersonators, lobby murals of sylvan scenes and dioramas of murderers. As the scrutiny of her camera disclosed, they were not quite what they first appeared to be.</p><p>Diane Arbus: Constellation, an exhibition at the Luma Foundation in Arles, France, is the largest display of Arbus prints ever mounted. In 2011, Maja Hoffmann, the Swiss pharmaceutical heiress who founded Luma, purchased all 454 artist proofs made by Neil Selkirk, the sole person authorised to print Arbus negatives after her suicide in 1971. At the suggestion of Luma photography curator Matthieu Humery, Hoffman is displaying all the photos for the first time, to mark the centenary of Arbus’s birth.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/aug/02/wild-weird-wonderful-diane-arbus-unsettling-genius">Continue reading...</a>

But there are people living there who experience it very differently. One is Finn Lau. For him, London has become a threatening place. As he tells <strong>Michael Safi, </strong>he is a Hong Kong political activist in exile in the UK. For years now, he has been on a Chinese government list of serious criminals and all day, every day – even though he is thousands of miles from Chinese territory – he feels as if he is being watched.</p><p>A few weeks ago, Lau woke to the news that Beijing had announced a reward of 1m Hong Kong dollars (around £100,000). That bounty is more than what the Hong Kong government is offering for fugitives accused of murder or for arsonists accused of killing 17 people. But Lau is determined not to give in – and he remains hopeful that one day he will be able to return home.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/aug/02/life-in-london-finn-lau-hong-kong-one-of-china-most-wanted-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
