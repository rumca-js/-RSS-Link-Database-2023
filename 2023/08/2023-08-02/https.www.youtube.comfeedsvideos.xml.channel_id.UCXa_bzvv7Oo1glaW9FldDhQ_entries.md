Disney Illusion Island won’t deliver incredible complex level design or pose a stiff challenge the way you’d expect most platformers to, but it’s still an easy game to recommend. 

Not only does it look gorgeous thanks to its charming art design and the excellent, nostalgia-infusing animations, it’s also a solid game in its own right, with good level design that encourages exploration, platforming mechanics that remain enjoyable in spite of how straightforward they are, and every inch of the experience being infused with oodles of charm and personality. 

No, it won’t be giving the likes of Metroid Dread a run for their money anytime soon, but it’s still an incredibly easy game to pick up and have quite a lot of fun with.

Action games that let you live out your wildest power fantasies can be a rare sight to behold especially when we are talking about those that hit a high standard of quality. There are games like Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 and Marvel’s Wolverine to look forward to, but there’s also Indie-Us Games’ upcoming UNRESTRICTED which you probably didn’t know much about. 

It puts you in the shoes of an ordinary college guy who gets superpowers thanks to a meteorite crash - and must now save the world from an otherworldly danger. UNRESTRICTED has impressive flight mechanics, and the combat is fast flowing with plenty of varied attacks to choose from and chain together for some amazing feats. The world also looks pretty large in terms of square footing and features a number of distinct locales, which comes together to make UNRESTRICTED a solid game that’s worth looking forward to.

## 25 BEST POST-APOCALYPTIC GAMES On PC You Can't Afford To Miss

Post-apocalyptic games are some of the strangest forms of escapism since you're essentially exploring destroyed worlds (if not locally confined areas). Nevertheless, there's a certain peace to it all, whether you're roaming the landscape and making your own rules or picking up the pieces of society.

However, some games go in a different direction. The world may be completely uninhabitable, necessitating building a vehicle to stay alive or living underground. Horrible mutations may roam the landscape. Sometimes, you'll be choosing a side (or battling against) factions over what little resources are remaining.

Whatever the case is, there's still an appeal to survival and overcoming the odds. Check out several post-apocalyptic titles that are worth playing on PC here.
