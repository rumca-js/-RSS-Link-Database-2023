In Kenya, tokens are worth approximately 7700 shillings, or around US$54 \u2013 no small amount when the national gross income per capita is around US$2,170. The offer has worked, with thousands of people showing out in the capital of Nairobi this week to trade their iris scans for crypto and a digital ID.\n\nBut concerns about Worldcoin\u2019s commitment to privacy and the legality of its practices mean that, for now, anyone left holding a Worldcoin token will have to wait to cash it. Although the company\u2019s parent, Tools for Humanity GmbH, is <a href=\"https://techcabal.com/2023/08/01/worldcoin-meets-legal-requirement-in-kenya/\">registered</a> with the data commissioner as a data processor, and can legally collect private data from residents, privacy experts say there is no guarantee that it will do what it says with whatever data it collects. As well, there have been questions about the biometric security of the Orb, after <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/worldcoin-nears-100m-funding-round-amid-security-concerns\">malware was found</a> on operators\u2019 personal devices.\n\nDespite such concerns, Worldcoin is forging ahead with its plan for global domination, aiming to deploy 1,500 Orbs around the world. As reported by <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/worldcoin-says-will-allow-companies-governments-use-its-id-system-2023-08-02/\">Reuters</a>, the company wants to build a massive financial and identity community that can be of use to organizations, businesses, and governments.

Its Identitypass software provides selfie biometrics and liveness for customer onboarding and compliance with KYC regulations. The newly acquired <a href=\"https://usetunnel.com/\">Tunnel</a>, based in Nigeria, specializes in data analytics and infrastructure with an emphasis on secure business data sharing.\n\nThe move means that customers will have access to a wider range of APIs offering creditworthiness assessments, anti-fraud checks, and online user behavior insights. It will also allow businesses to scale more easily by giving them access to real-time customer information through a unified API.\n\nThis could be particularly useful for <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/namibias-financial-regulator-partners-with-prembly-on-digital-id-regulatory-sandbox\">financial institutions</a> across the globe, as financial data can be fundamental in verifying identities, the statement from Prembly suggests.

If passed, mDLs would become official IDs, equivalent to physical licenses.

Others raise concerns that deepfakes and other cyberattacks can circumvent biometric authentication.\n\n\"Given the ease and accessibility of generative AI tools that can create fake images, it\u2019s irresponsible for government or business entities to implement any system utilizing remote-based biometrics without the necessary protections against AI-created deepfakes digitally injected into vulnerable camera feeds,\" says Amlani.\n\nCalifornia's DMV is testing a mobile app that allows residents to upload mDLs to their phones with iProov\u2019s biometrics and liveness detection.\n\n\"Now, California residents will soon discover a mobile driver\u2019s license is not only a more secure way to verify one\u2019s identity without having to divulge significant amounts of personal information, but also a much more convenient option,\" says Amlani.\n\n\"To combat the combination of <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/4-in-10-businesses-have-already-seen-deepfakes-injection-attacks\">deepfakes and digital injection attacks</a>, organizations need a science-based, multifaceted approach like the California DMV is employing that leverages the creation of a one-time biometric.\"\n\nThe program currently has over 2,000 active participants and is set to expand over the next few weeks before a public roll out, according to <a href=\"https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/dmv-in-testing-stages-of-mobile-drivers-licenses-for-californians/3197194/\">NBC Los Angeles</a>.

The company also joined the LenelS2 OpenAccess Alliance Program, according to an announcement.\n\nThe access control system allowed visitors and employees to self-register remotely or at a reception desk by capturing their ID card and a photo of themselves. Once the system verifies a user's identity, it generates a non-transferable biometric access credential. The individual then presents their identity at the Veridas terminal, which can authenticate them in less than a second and then grant access.\n\n\u201cWith remote enrollment and facial access, no human intervention or physical credentials are needed,\" says Eduardo Azanza, Veridas CEO. \"We are thrilled with this strong alliance and look forward to seeing the breakthrough opportunities it provides to organizations.\u201d\n<h2><strong>SQR Group certified to UK DIATF</strong></h2>\n<a href=\"https://www.sqrgroup.com/\">SQR Group Ltd</a> has been certified to the UKs Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework (DIATF) as an Identity Services Provider (IDSP) and Attributes Service Provider (ASP) to give customers confidence in the quality of their digital identity services.\n\nThe certification follows an assessment by BSI Group.\n\nThe company\u2019s technology tokenizes user\u2019s verified face biometrics to secure on- and offline identity verification.\n\n\u201cTrust is imperative within the digital ID ecosystem, given the sensitive nature of the data collected, managed and stored, so achieving certification on the Trust Framework was an absolute non-negotiable for us,\u201d says SQR Group CEO Shelley Langan-Newton. \u201cClients can be assured of trust at every touchpoint with SQR.\"", "link": "https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/idnow-veridas-vouched-authenticid-sqr-group-announce-certifications", "date_published": "2023-08-02T18:36:41+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/biometricupdate", "title": "Vsblty pushes live facial recognition capability of retail analytics portfolio", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"929\" src=\"https://d1sr9z1pdl3mb7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/11144903/retail-biometric-payments-scaled.jpg\" width=\"2048\" />\n\t\t<a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/vsblty\">Vsblty</a>, a company focused on bringing biometrics to retail, is laying out its business plans for the years 2023 and 2024.

The displays are placed in stores and can identify both specific customers and types of customers based on demographics such as age and gender.\n\nIts platform collects anonymized data about customers' behaviors, providing analytics to businesses on where their products are being purchased and who are their customers in real-time. The company says that the platform has increased sales by over 25 percent.\n\nThe company also sells security products that can recognize known offenders with live facial recognition and detect weapons, as well as track and report suspicious behavior in public spaces.\n\nIts platform has been deployed and tested in over 10,000 security cameras in Mexico, with over 3,700 of those cameras installed in the Benito Juarez district of Mexico City. The deployment has resulted in a 48 percent reduction in high-impact crimes such as violent assaults, robberies, and burglaries and an increase in public perceptions of safety in the district, according to the company.\n\n\"Our AI-driven approach delivers quantifiable, real-world benefits in both retail environments and for crime prevention,\" says CEO of Vsblty Jay Hutton. \"With our recent financing, we have the funds, the team, the experience and opportunities to create additional shareholder value as we further deploy systems for our clients through 2023 and 2024.\"\n\nVsblty has pulled in <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202211/retail-video-analytics-investment-defies-market-trend-with-vsblty-raise-march-acquisition\">$3.9 million</a> in private placements by November 2022.

The public can submit their comments on the draft until August 18.\n\nAmong some of the key points of the document is the need for employers to justify the proportionality of using biometric systems and balancing legitimate interests against employee privacy. The collection of biometric data must be based on free informed consent.\n\nThe agency also provides a ranking of preferred alternatives for managing employee attendance. In regards to biometrics, the documents recommend that data is stored in a decentralized way, for example on smart cards, instead of a centralized database owned by the employer.\n\nEmployers using biometric attendance systems should register a database with the Privacy Protection Authority and need to provide sufficient details, including purposes, name of the individual in charge, where data is stored, security measures, potential risks, employee access and rectification rights, retention, how data can be removed from the database and third party recipients.\n\nThe document also outlines other procedures for handling biometric data, such as data minimization. Employers are expected to use databases only for the specific purpose for which it was collected and delete any biometric data that is no longer required, such as those from employees who have quit or have retired.\n\nThe draft policy paper is an update to the Israeli Privacy Protection Authority previous paper from 2012.\n\nData privacy, particularly relating to biometrics, has been a recurring issue in Israel, between a <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202207/israeli-court-rejects-call-to-delete-governments-biometric-database-leaves-room-for-appeal\">massive government database</a> of citizens\u2019 faces and fingerprints and the suggestion late last year by the state comptroller that the <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202212/israel-defense-criticized-over-26-year-old-privacy-protocols-for-biometric-data\">IDF\u2019s privacy protocols</a> are obsolete.", "link": "https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/israel-issues-draft-guidelines-on-biometric-data-collection-in-the-workplace", "date_published": "2023-08-02T17:27:54+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/biometricupdate", "title": "Russia bans foreign online ID verification systems", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"1367\" src=\"https://d1sr9z1pdl3mb7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/07105906/laptop-phone-access-control-credentials-scaled.jpg\" width=\"2048\" />\n\t\tRussian President Vladimir Putin has signed a package of laws further regulating the country\u2019s online sphere, including a ban on user registrations with foreign e-mail addresses or ID services by Gmail or Apple in favor of domestic digital ID players.\n\nThe move has caused an uproar in the Russian IT industry which says that the regulation will affect verification for online financial services. And local digital rights activists <a href=\"https://roskomsvoboda.org/post/zakony-protiv-ineta-2023/\">see it as another step</a> towards isolating the Russian internet.\n\nPeople wanting to register on Russian platforms have limited digital ID options. They can use the government services platform, <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202212/russian-lawmakers-okay-legal-framework-for-biometric-data-collection-and-processing\">Gosuslugi</a>, and the government's Unified Identification and Authentication System (<a href=\"https://ict.moscow/en/card/esia/\">ESIA)</a>, which is connected to the federal remote biometric identification platform <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/unified-biometrics-system\">Unified Biometric System</a>. They can also register using a domestic phone number or use Russia-based internet service firms such as Yandex.\n\n\"We believe that the ID of Russian users should be tied to a Russian phone number, e-mail in .ru and .rf domains, Gosuslugi or biometrics,\" Anton Gorelkin, deputy of the State Duma's Information Policy Committee and author of the amendment, <a href=\"https://lenta.ru/news/2023/07/25/registratsiya/\">told</a> local media last week.\n\nGorelkin claimed the move will prevent data leaks and thefts. The changes are effective December 1 as part of <a href=\"http://publication.pravo.gov.ru/document/0001202307310022?pageSize=100&amp;index=1\">amendments</a> to two federal laws regulating online information. It will affect only sites that require registration and authentication and will not be retroactive.\n\nCritics, however, say that none of the four authorization methods provide a convenient experience for users of online financial services without meaningful risk reduction. The move to the <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202210/russia-to-establish-center-for-biometric-technologies-to-operate-national-database\">ESIA</a> system could also strain its infrastructure as it will have to handle millions of authorization requests daily, including accessing internet banking and online wallets.\n\n\u201cAnd failures in this infrastructure will actually mean the inability to access remote service channels, which will have an extremely negative impact on confidence in the financial sector,\u201d Victor Dostov, president of the Russian E-Money and Remittance Association <a href=\"https://www.forbes.ru/tekhnologii/493439-novye-pravila-registracii-v-internete-ugrozaut-prilozeniam-bankov-i-apple-id\">told</a> Forbes' Russian-language service.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.vedomosti.ru/technologies/innovation_policy/articles/2023/07/19/986118-net-predela-sovershenstvu\">According</a> to its proponents, the ESIA platform coupled with biometric identification could turn into a digital ID service that can be used in the financial industry for remote client verification while Gosuslugi could provide data on Russian citizens in real-time.
