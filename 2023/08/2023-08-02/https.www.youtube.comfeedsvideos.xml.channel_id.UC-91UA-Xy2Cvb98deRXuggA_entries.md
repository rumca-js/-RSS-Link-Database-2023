'Greedflation', a term coined by 'The Hill' in 2023. Unlike regular inflation, which pertains to the rising costs of goods and services, Greedflation refers to the disproportionate inflation of corporate sector's profits compared to the general economy, productivity, and wage increases. We explore how this widening pay gap and disparity is not only causing unrest but is unsustainable in the long run.

We dive into the statistics revealing the stark difference in the growth rates of corporate profits and wage increases. We discuss the possible drivers of this issue, such as stock buybacks, tax breaks for corporations, low minimum wages, and lack of workers' rights. We also touch upon the long-term implications and potential solutions, highlighting the importance of better legislation and a fair tax structure.

This video draws examples from companies like General Mills, Tyson Foods, PepsiCo, Ulta Beauty, and Kimberly-Clark that have benefited from this profit-boosting trend, despite the Fed's efforts to control inflation. As we wrap up, we emphasize the role of consumers, workers, and citizens in challenging this narrative and seeking a fairer deal. Remember to like, share, and subscribe for more insightful content. Together, we can create a fairer world, one paycheck at a time.
