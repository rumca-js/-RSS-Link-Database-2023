We’ve got a brand new look at Godzilla in all his glory in new images released by TOHO from Godzilla: Minus One. Godzilla Minus One takes place after the devastating events of World War 2. What TOHO has planned for #Godzilla moving forward after #GodzillaMinusOne should be promising for fans who want more of the massive monster. TOHO has been laying the groundwork for moreGodzilla movies since 2021, speeding up the Kaiju-shared universe it has in development . This will be separate from what Legendary and WB are doing with its Godzilla x Kong Monsterverse, so don’t expect any tie-ins to happen there. The late George Romero’s final zombie flick, Twilight of the Dead, is looking like it’ll see the light of day. And finally, Twitter X Blue subscribers are now granted the ability to hide their verification status.

Now that the Barbie movie is out and cleaning up in theaters, Hollywood is, of course, going to think "one good turn deserves another." But here's the thing - the Barbie movie reaction can't be duplicated. What Margot Robbie, Greta Gerwig, Ryan Gosling, and all those involved with bringing the Barbie doll to the silver screen did is something special, something MGM will have a tough time doing with Polly Pocket or any of the other toy-based projects they have in development.

In this Barbie reaction, IGN host Kim Horcher discusses Barbie (2023), what made the film so special, and how studios are going to have a hard time replicating this success with lesser-known toy franchises.

Rosamund Pike and her co-stars break down the key moments from Wheel of Time, Season One that one needs to remember heading into Season Two, which launches on Prime Video on September 1.

Based on the best-selling Robert Jordan fantasy series The Wheel of Time, a humble farm boy, Rand al’Thor (Josha Stradowski, Gran Turismo), learns he is The Dragon Reborn—a dangerous figure from history destined to save the world … or break it. Desperate to protect him from the Dark One, an army of powerful women must reckon with his burgeoning power and encroaching madness. The Wheel of Time turns, and the Last Battle approaches. Though Rand thought he destroyed the Dark One, evil is not gone from the world. In Season Two, threats new and very old seek out the young friends from the Two Rivers, now scattered over the world. The woman who found and guided them is now powerless to help, and so they must find other sources of strength. In each other, or themselves. In the Light ... or the Dark.

The Wheel of Time was adapted for television by executive producer and showrunner Rafe Judkins (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Hemlock Grove). Larry Mondragon and Rick Selvage of iwot productions (Winter Dragon), Ted Field of Radar Pictures (Jumanji: The Next Level, Winter Dragon), Mike Weber (Jumanji: The Next Level, Beirut), Darren Lemke (Shazam!, Goosebumps, Winter Dragon), Marigo Kehoe (Outlander, The Crown), Justine Juel Gillmer (The Survivor, Halo), Sanaa Hamri (Empire, Lovestruck), and Amanda Kate Shuman (The Blacklist) also serve as executive producers. Rosamund Pike also serves as co-executive producer, and Harriet McDougal, Brandon Sanderson, and Lauren Selig are consulting producers. The Wheel of Time is co-produced by Amazon Studios and Sony Pictures Television Studios.

When police raid a house in El Paso, they find it full of dead Latinos, and only one survivor. He’s known as The Traveler, and when they take him to the station for questioning he tells them those lands are full of magic and talks about the horrors he’s encountered in his long time on this earth, about portals to other worlds, mythical creatures, demons and the undead.

Directed by Mike Mendez (Big Ass Spider!), Demián Rugna (Terrified), Gigi Saul Guerrero (Bingo Hell), Alejandro Brugues (Juan of the Dead), and Eduardo Sánchez (The Blair Witch Project), the film spotlights Hispanic talent both in front and behind the camera. Each director hails from a different corner of Latin America, contributing folklore and political and social commentary from Argentina, Cuba, and Mexico, fused through a genre lens.
