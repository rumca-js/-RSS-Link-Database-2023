<p>Nato official apologises for saying Ukraine could give up territory to Russia; Russia shoots down Ukrainian drones near Moscow</p><p><strong>A senior Nato official has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/16/nato-official-suggests-ukraine-could-give-up-territory-in-exchange-for-membership">apologised and clarified his comments</a>, a day after he said publicly that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> could give up territory to Russia in exchange for Nato membership and an end to the war.</strong> Stian Jenssen, the chief of staff to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/nato">Nato</a> secretary general, said “My statement about this was part of a larger discussion about possible future scenarios in Ukraine, and I shouldn’t have said it that way. It was a mistake.”</p><p><strong>Ukraine’s forces have entrenched themselves on the outskirts of Urozhaine after recapturing the settlement in the Donetsk region from Russian forces, </strong>Ukraine’s deputy defence minister said. Hanna Maliar posted on the Telegram messaging app on Wednesday morning that the village had been liberated, adding that offensive operations continue.</p><p><strong>Ukraine’s air force on Wednesday said a large group of Russian army drones entered the mouth of the Danube river and headed toward the Izmail river port near the border with Romania.</strong> The governor of southern Odesa region, Oleh Kiper, asked residents of Izmail district to take shelter at about 1:30 am and cancelled the air raid alert one hour later.</p><p><strong>Russia’s defence ministry said Wednesday it shot down three Ukrainian drones southwest of Moscow, </strong>the latest in a surge of aerial attacks near the capital. Ukraine launched the attack at 5:00 am using “three unmanned aerial vehicles on objects in the Kaluga region”, the ministry said on Telegram.</p><p><strong>Russian authorities refused to renew the visa for Dutch journalist Eva Hartog,</strong> who has lived and worked in the country for 10 years, and gave her six days to leave Russia, she said in a column published Wednesday. Her effective expulsion is one of several in recent years and comes amid a months-long crackdown that the Kremlin has unleashed on independent journalists, critical news outlets, opposition activists and human rights groups.</p><p><strong>The United States condemned Russia’s continued attacks on Ukraine’s grain infrastructure in a</strong> state department statement on Wednesday, as it called for Moscow to return immediately to the grain deal. Russian president Vladimir Putin does not care about global food security, state department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel told reporters after Ukraine earlier on Wednesday said Russia had attacked its grain storage facilities overnight.</p><p><strong>Kyiv said a civilian cargo vessel had exited its southern port of Odesa on Wednesday</strong> despite warnings from Russia that its navy could target ships using Ukraine’s Black Sea export hubs.</p><p><strong>Ukraine will not be able to operate US-built F-16 fighter jets this coming autumn and winter,</strong> air force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat told Ukrainian television late on Wednesday. “It’s already obvious we won’t be able to defend Ukraine with F-16 fighter jets during this autumn and winter,” Ihnat told a joint telethon broadcast by Ukrainian channels.</p><p><strong>Vladimir Putin is reportedly planning to hold a meeting with Russian policymakers on Wednesday</strong> in order to discuss <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/aug/16/putin-meeting-capital-controls-rouble-report">reintroducing some capital controls to help prop up the struggling rouble</a>. Citing a Russian finance ministry proposal, the Financial Times said large exporters could be forced to convert up to 80% of their foreign currency into roubles in order to raise demand for the currency.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/17/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-540-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>

It’s very rare, very unique. I want people to look at it, be inspired by it, and know that it’s never too late.”</p><p>Until 2018, Amo-Dadzie’s sporting journey was as unremarkable as thousands of others, up and down the land.

But in the winter of 2018, he suddenly decided to give track and field a whirl.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/16/eugene-amo-dadzie-world-athletics-championship-budapest">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Two inventive productions, Dimanche and Concerned Others, use puppetry and object-theatre to tackle vast environmental and social subjects</p><p>Such is the enormity of the problems facing humanity at the start of the 21st century, it is hard to get a perspective on them. How can we comprehend overwhelmingly large events such as the melting of the ice caps at the same time as trying to do something about it? Can the shifting perspectives of puppetry and an object-theatre world, where vast landscapes are rendered in miniature and street-level problems are viewed from above, allow us to think afresh about questions that otherwise seem too close for comfort?</p><p>Two shows in Edinburgh attempt to come up with an answer. Running in the international festival, Dimanche (<strong>★★★☆☆</strong>) is a collaboration between Focus and Chaliwaté, two Belgian puppetry and physical theatre companies, and uses a jokey cartoon-like format to take us on a global tour of environmental disasters. In their roles as a wildlife documentary crew, the performers Julie Tenret, Sicaire Durieux and Sandrine Heyraud (who also write and direct) come to an unfortunate end as the ice cracks, the waters rise and the storms brew.</p><p>Dimanche is at <a href="https://www.eif.co.uk/events/dimanche">Church Hill theatre, Edinburgh</a>, until 19 August.

<p>Sarina Wiegman’s new system suits both players and they could help decide the World Cup final against Spain</p><p>In the 86th minute in Sydney, with the game finely balanced, Lauren Hemp galloped up the pitch. Shrugging off a defender, a trademark burst of pace enabled her to maraud from one half to the other before producing the deftest of no-look passes to send Alessia Russo through to score. In 10 seconds flat, the player of the match had changed the course of the game, with her strike partner putting it beyond the reach of a heartbroken Australia.</p><p>It was a goal that lifted the lid on the pressure cooker inside Stadium Australia. Hemp herself had restored England’s lead with dogged determination after Sam Kerr’s equaliser. The Matildas, however, had been on top in the minutes before – Kerr inexplicably missed the target twice and the Lionesses were saved by a terrific recovery challenge from Jess Carter. The semi-final was on a knife-edge, and it required someone with Hemp’s skillset to disrupt the flow.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/aug/16/lauren-hemp-realises-her-england-potential-as-russo-partnership-grows">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Interest rates are too blunt an instrument for an economy so finely balanced. It’s time to use taxes</p><p>“The plan is working,” is how Rishi Sunak greeted Wednesday’s news of a fall in the rate of inflation. “If we stick to the plan I’ve set out, <a href="https://twitter.com/RishiSunak/status/1691698262955221375?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" title="">we’ll get it done</a>.”</p><p>Up to a point, prime minister. Mr Sunak’s “plan” is really nothing of the sort. It is an aspiration to halve the rate by which prices are rising rather than, as is commonly assumed, for prices to fall. And he wants to do this without a hand raised by any of his ministers. It is not the business secretary, Kemi Badenoch, who controls oil and gas prices, but traders in commodity markets – and rather than watching Whitehall, they have their eyes peeled for moves by Vladimir Putin or Opec. It is not Jeremy Hunt at the Treasury who sets interest rates, but Andrew Bailey and his colleagues at the Bank of England. And the people of Threadneedle Street may be alarmed by core inflation, which strips out volatile items such as food and fuel, remaining stubbornly high. With only four months before his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/21/will-rishi-sunak-december-deadline-halve-inflation" title="">self-imposed deadline</a>, this looks like one life goal the man in No 10 will miss.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/16/the-guardian-view-on-inflation-stop-hitting-homebuyers-and-squeeze-the-super-rich">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Readers respond to Fiona Miller’s article on how Labour could reform education in England</p><p>Having worked as a teacher for 10 years in a grammar, an independent and now a community comprehensive school, the calls to tax independent schools, as echoed by Fiona Millar, ring with the ideological purity of those who are prepared to place motives above outcomes (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/13/grammar-schools-gcse-labour-education-england" title="">Reform grammar schools and ditch the GCSE treadmill – here’s how Labour can fix education in England, 13 August</a>).</p><p>I wholeheartedly believe in her summative closing paragraph, calling for an educational experience that supports and ensures success according to each child’s needs and ambitions. She is also correct in recognising that this is what parents are paying for through independent education. And yet, where many parents opt to ensure this for their children, with no guarantee that their local underfunded and oversubscribed comprehensive school can, the position of many on the Labour left is to penalise these children and their families. Motive and means, it seems, trump outcomes in an educational retelling of Margaret Thatcher’s “so long as the gap is smaller”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/aug/16/there-are-no-quick-fixes-to-an-unequal-school-exam-system">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Britain’s current prison system neither rehabilitates nor delivers justice, write <strong>Deborah Coles</strong>,<em> </em><strong>Joe Sim</strong> and<em> </em><strong>Steve Tombs</strong></p><p>Re your editorial on the state of prisons (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/11/the-guardian-view-on-prisons-labour-should-be-bold-in-demanding-an-overhaul" title="">11 August</a>), the prison population in England and Wales, over 86,000, is at a near record high, more than any country in western Europe. The government states its intention to create <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/thousands-of-new-prison-places-to-rehabilitate-offenders-and-cut-crime" title="">20,000 new prison places</a> by the mid-2020s, a matter of seeming political consensus. At the same time, the length of sentences is increasing inexorably.</p><p>Yet the weight of evidence is clear: prison does not work. It does not deter – there is no discernible link between levels of imprisonment and crime rates. Nor does prison rehabilitate – adults released from sentences of less than 12 months have a proven reoffending rate of 55.1%. And prison hardly delivers justice – most of those imprisoned are for non-violent offences. Indeed, prison itself is a site of violence and harm. In the year to June, 313 people died in prison, with 88 of those deaths self-inflicted, alongside almost 60,000 self-harm incidents. Prison is an ineffective, expensive intervention.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/aug/16/focus-on-prison-places-is-a-political-ploy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>He was mentored by Ligeti, too shy to meet Beckett, and half of one of the greatest ever musical and romantic partnerships. As his opera arrives at the Proms, the avant garde master gives a rare interview</p><p>György Kurtág is not speaking metaphorically when he says he is quite content to spend the time he has left “living on Ligeti street”. He is with a small crowd gathered outside the Budapest Music Centre – in which he also resides – for the renaming ceremony of the road on which it stands. Formerly Imre Utca (street), it is now György Ligeti street, to mark the centenary of the Hungarian composer who was Kurtág’s longtime friend and mentor.</p><p>Kurtág, whose intense, intimate and often brief music could hardly be more different to Ligeti’s<strong>,</strong> spent years in the latter’s shadow; international recognition only came in the 80s. But even 17 years after Ligeti’s death, he can scarcely contemplate a conversation or a composition without referring to him. He rarely gives interviews, but has made an exception to mark his friend’s anniversary and the UK debut of his first opera.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/16/i-compose-to-seek-the-truth-gyorgy-kurtag-on-totalitarianism-depression-and-his-73-year-marriage">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Artist and designer Harry Nesbitt explains how his game pays homage to a countryside practice stretching back through history</p><p>In the soft, rolling hills of the Derbyshire dales the grass is clipped to just a few centimetres by gently bleating sheep. For game artist and designer Harry Nesbitt who grew up here, this countryside is in his blood. “There’s something there deep in my subconscious,” he says. “I always want to tell stories or depict worlds that are close to my heart.”</p><p>Nesbitt’s fondness for this terrain is visible the very first time you look at Summerhill, his forthcoming puzzle-adventure game that tasks the player with herding sheep through a bucolic landscape. You’re accompanied by a dog who provides key assistance; you’ll come across intriguing ruined structures, the remains of an ancient civilisation whose culture was centred on shepherding, through which you must guide your growing flock. Nesbitt says these ruins are designed in order to “contain, funnel, or sort” sheep in certain ways, causing the player to “rationalise” and “reconfigure” the space in order to progress.</p><p>Summerhill will be out on PC and unannounced platforms; release date TBA</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/aug/16/one-man-and-his-dog-summerhill-turns-shepherding-into-a-video-game-puzzle">Continue reading...</a>

## Short sharp shocks: the glorious return of the Amicus portmanteau horror film

<p>The studio that mastered the art of the gleefully ghoulish cinematic short-story collection in the 60s and 70s is set to return. It may just raise a terrific genre from the dead</p><p>Although Hammer usually receives the bulk of the recognition, there would be no real British horror movie scene without Amicus Productions. Between 1962 and 1977, Amicus produced 28 movies, many of which have become cult classics. The Psychopath. The Deadly Bees. And Now the Screaming Starts! Fine films, all.</p><p>But where Amicus really sang was in its “portmanteau” films, made up of five or six short stories connected by a loose overarching theme. These films were not only masterpieces of creativity (after all, it’s much easier to string out one bad idea for 90 minutes than to cram in half a dozen) but also of marketing. Most of the seven Amicus anthologies were sold on the star power of one actor who, given the brevity of each story, might have only appeared on screen for a couple of minutes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/16/return-of-portmanteau-horror-films-amicus">Continue reading...</a>

## Mansplainers! Stop boring your fellow adults. Try dadsplaining instead | Joel Snape

<p>One of my life’s great joys has been mining the depths of my knowledge for my children. Just one proviso: don’t try to explain every event in We Didn’t Start The Fire</p><p>Where does the urge to mansplain come from? Hold on, please don’t rush straight to the comments to tell me; I’ve got my own theory. I think it’s about one part male privilege to five parts something more primal: a vestigial survival urge that we learn at school.</p><p>In the world of the small, awkward boy, knowing stuff is currency: grownups are impressed when you can explain the workings of a trimaran; other youths show grudging respect if you can display an in-depth knowledge of Warhammer 40k lore. This feeling never entirely leaves us, so we go out into the world stepping on endless metaphorical rakes as we mistake polite lack of interest for rapt attention. Some of us grow out of this, have it gently bullied out of us by romantic partners or learn to sense when it’s not wanted. Others never quite kick the habit and spend their lives missing stifled yawns or lecturing astrophysicists about their own fields of expertise.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/aug/16/mansplainers-stop-boring-your-fellow-adults-try-dadsplaining-instead">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘These aren’t perfect bodies but this is everyone’s future, and I wanted to show that old age is not a dismal, barren place. Sex is a natural instinct that doesn’t go away’</p><p>My book Elder Sex came out of an article about sex after the age of 70 which was published <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/12/magazine/sex-old-age.html">in the New York Times magazine</a> in January 2022. It’s all the pictures that the Times couldn’t publish. For instance, they couldn’t show any vibrators. America is a puritan country, remember? We have all these uptight evangelicals here.</p><p>All the friends I asked said no to posing, because there’s so much contempt for the subject of elder sex. It’s treated as a joke. So the Times did the casting call and I picked my models from that. I wanted real bodies, and I tried to get every race and every size. They had thought about using professional models but – how do I say this delicately? – the models just didn’t look their age. So we used actors, which also meant they could convincingly act intimate and in love.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/aug/16/an-honest-depiction-of-elder-sex-marilyn-minters-best-photograph">Continue reading...</a>

Sign up here</a></strong></p><p>It’s my birthday today, and Rockstar has been kind enough to rerelease its 2010 western opus Red Dead Redemption on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch (out tomorrow), as a slightly late birthday gift. It is indisputably a landmark game, less ambitious but also less self-indulgent than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/oct/25/red-dead-redemption-2-review-western-playstation-xbox-rockstar">its 2018 sequel</a>. The first game is tauter, its crafted set-pieces more memorable. Everyone who’s played it remembers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXGW6sWYDY">that moment when you cross the border</a> into Mexico, and José González starts to play as the sun rises. Few games boast a single moment that compares to it.</p><p>I played Red Dead Redemption the summer after I graduated university, mainlining the whole thing in three days. I remember getting inordinately attached to my horse, the vast desert expanses, the encroaching inevitability of its shock ending at John Marston’s farmhouse, which I saw coming but still gasped at. I remember hating the feds with every fibre of my being, and unexpectedly hating some of Marston’s former outlaw friends just as much. It was a game with no real winners – still unusual at the time – and took the same bleak view of humanity’s essential moral depravity as the Grand Theft Auto series, but with fewer off-colour jokes and more moments of fleeting beauty. I have been looking forward to playing it again.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/aug/16/pushing-buttons-red-dead-redemption-rerelease">Continue reading...</a>

Since pop music began, pop stars have waded into complicated political issues in the mistaken belief that they can somehow solve everything with their broad platitudes and their nice hair.

## Gavin Bryars Ensemble review – Jesus’ Blood Never Failed Me Yet

<p><strong>Britten Studio, Snape<br /></strong>A performance in belated honour of the British composer’s birthday, with Bryars himself on double bass, showcased the variety of his music, with his best known piece at its centre</p><p>G<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/gavin-bryars">avin Bryars</a> has been giving concerts with his own instrumental ensemble since 1986. Inevitably its members and quirky instrumentation have changed over the years, and the current lineup consists of piano, electric guitar, viola and cello, with Bryars himself playing the double bass. Two further cellists, Bryars’s daughters, Ziella and Orlanda, are part of the group for the series of concerts this autumn that are a belated celebration of his 80th birthday earlier this year.</p><p>The programme changes from venue to venue throughout the tour, but its centrepiece is a constant – a performance of Bryars’ most famous work, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/08/i-still-get-a-tingle-gavin-bryars-on-why-his-most-famous-work-has-never-failed-him-yet">Jesus’ Blood Never Failed Me Yet</a>. Composed in 1971, when Bryars was very much one of the leaders of British experimental music, this piece, which is entirely built around a 26-second tape loop of a homeless man singing a couple of phrases from a hymn that perhaps he remembered from his childhood, has never lost its power to move. The work exists in a number of realisations of very different durations – in the 1990s Bryars made a CD-length recording of it with Tom Waits singing along with the tape in the final section – but the accompanying ensemble always enriches and cradles the fragile, unknown voice, before it gradually fades away.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/16/gavin-bryars-ensemble-review-jesus-blood-80th-birthday-snape">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From rap mixtapes to music journalism and ghostly drum machine-led folk, the late British artist had few boundaries. Her husband and fans remember her tough, inspiring life</p><p><br />In 1998, an album was released that made quiet ripples. Recorded in the evenings after she had put her four-year-old to bed, Charlotte Greig recorded simple versions of folk songs and originals about lovers and ghosts that come to you at night. She used a four-track cassette recorder to tape her voice, harmonium, dulcimer and an idiosyncratically programmed Dr Rhythm drum machine.</p><p>Released on vinyl for the first time this month, Night Visiting Songs still sounds unearthly, beautiful and startlingly sincere, carrying the ghosts of Anne Briggs, Nico and the Young Marble Giants in its textures and rhythms. A set of cover versions follows on Bandcamp, with James Yorkston, Alasdair Roberts, Euros Childs and Katell Keineg among the artists paying tribute. It is a timely reminder of the many talents of Greig, who killed herself in 2014 at the age of 59.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/16/i-had-to-compose-myself-when-i-first-heard-her-the-astonishing-musical-versatility-of-the-late-charlotte-greig">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A new docuseries explores the ‘untold stories’ of the musicians at the centre of a creative boom and what happened when tragedy struck </p><p>Enough time has passed for the scene in 60s San Francisco to turn from memory to history, now understood predominantly as a set of ideas and signifiers: flower power, free love, fringe vests, infrequent showers, idealistic good vibes giving way to an inevitable comedown. If this pivotal moment in time threatens to become self-parody, reduced to a tie-dyed Halloween costume, it’s due in part to the hyperbolic terms used by the Boomers who lived through it. The Haight-Ashbury neighborhood was a paradise too edenic to last, as the record goes, where “the streets were paved with LSD”.</p><p>In the new two-part MGM+ documentary San Francisco Sounds, poster designer Victor Moscoso – a pioneer of the far-out psychedelic aesthetic synonymous with this cultural moment – intends that description as firmly tongue-in-cheek. He shares an approximate viewpoint and goal with directors Alison Ellwood and Anoosh Tertzakian, who aim to recapture the magic of this fleeting, fertile heyday while focusing on the details of assorted lives over romanticized fantasy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/aug/16/san-francisco-sounds-1960s-mgm-documentary">Continue reading...</a>

To quote <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sickos-haha-yes">the Sickos meme</a>: “YES. .. HA HA HA ... YES!” The trailer looked promising. This could have been just what the fledgling franchise needed, especially as even Jon Turteltaub, director of the first Meg, had expressed disappointment at the first film’s lack of gore. “The number of really horrifying, disgusting and bloody deaths we had lined up that we didn’t get to do is tragic,” he told <a href="http://bloodydisgusting.com/">bloodydisgusting.com</a>.</p><p>But the market knows what it wants, which in the case of The Meg was a family film with a PG or 12A rating. Additionally, it was a US-Chinese co-production, and Chinese censors don’t like gore. Well, guess what: Meg 2: The Trench is also an American-Chinese co-production aimed at family audiences, and, give or take a splash in the final reel, it’s even more bloodless than its predecessor.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/16/gore-free-monster-movies-the-meg-jurassic-park-jaws">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From sunny novels that revel in the picturesque to stark reports from one of the poorest regions in northern Europe, this county’s  literature deserves more than a visit</p><p>‘Why am I so incredibly and incurably romantic about Cornwall?” wrote Virginia Woolf in 1921. For centuries, the natural beauty of Cornwall has captured the imagination of writers and the resulting literature is as varied as the landscape itself, from sunny novels that revel in the picturesque to authentic and unflinching depictions of one of the poorest regions in northern Europe.</p><p>My own approach to writing about Cornwall is one of both escapism and realism. The Shell House Detectives grew out of a longing for the wide-open skies and seas of Penwith during that endless winter of 2020/21. An image kept returning to me of a weatherboard house in the dunes; an unlikely friendship forged in a moment of crisis. As much as I play into the conventions of the cosy crime genre, I’ve also drawn my own line in the sand, conjuring a world that I hope is enchanting but also feels real.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/16/top-10-books-set-in-cornwall-emylia-hall">Continue reading...</a>

The difference was that those earlier conspiracy theories were focused almost entirely on the Clintons, while the current iteration is far more diffuse and its targets far more wide-reaching.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/16/qanon-conspiracy-theory-sound-of-freedom-trump-desantis">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Powerful story of disguise and alienation is led by the moral passion of Pacino’s countercultural whistleblower </p><p>Film-making guts and glory are on display from director Sidney Lumet, star Al Pacino and many others in this compelling New York crime drama from 1973. It is based on the true story of whistleblowing police officer Frank Serpico who, outraged by the top-to-bottom corruption in the NYPD, finally went to the New York Times with his evidence. In revenge, dirty cops knowingly led Serpico into a dangerous standoff with armed criminals in an apartment building and left him undefended to be shot in the face. Screenwriters Waldo Salt and Norman Wexler adapted the bestseller from journalist Peter Maas’s book about the police officer’s remarkable life, on which Serpico collaborated almost immediately on being invalided out of the department.</p><p>Serpico is a classic movie of 1970s New York: it has Tony Roberts, F Murray Abraham and M Emmet Walsh in minor roles; sweat and grit and fear pulse off it like waves; and there are dynamic streetscape scenes. For me the most extraordinary of these comes when an entirely corrupt officer, driving in a squad car with Serpico in the passenger seat, sees a young black man on the street who he needs to shakedown, and recklessly reverses at speed through three city blocks to the astonishment of bystanders to track him down and beat him up. The casual and ubiquitous racism of the police is an obvious factor here.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/16/serpico-review-al-pacino-is-at-his-intense-best-in-classic-70s-corrupt-cop-thriller">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There are prompts to add around 20% for simply buying a pint of milk at the local shop or picking up a coffee. How can we stop this madness?</p><p>The US may be a bitterly divided country, but I think I’ve found a topic which pretty much everyone can unite behind: tipping culture is out of control. The US norm of tipping at least 20% on a meal, and at (the very, very) least $1 a drink at a bar, has always confused European tourists.

## Caret by Adam Mars-Jones review – a semi-infinite novel

<p>The third instalment in the brilliantly immersive autobiography of tragicomic creation John Cromer takes a picaresque tour of 1970s England</p><p>Caret is the third volume of what <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/adam-mars-jones" title="">Adam Mars-Jones</a>’s publisher has dubbed a “semi-infinite novel”: the moment-by-moment autobiography of his tragicomic creation, John Cromer. Like the first two, it takes a proofreading mark for its title. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/mar/30/fiction.reviews1" title="">Pilcrow</a>, volume one, was named after the paragraph break symbol; the second, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jan/15/cedilla-adam-mars-jones-review" title="">Cedilla</a>, after the Ç accent. Caret, meanwhile, is a mark used by subeditors to indicate a missing word – so it’s clear from the off that Mars-Jones can take, or better yet make, a joke. The plain fact is that there <em>are</em> no missing words here: Caret runs to a whopping 752 pages of text that is dense both<em> </em>literally and figuratively; our hero is not a man to say in a sentence what he could plausibly spin out over the course of a page. No experience is too small to be described; no reflection (“And what is Fybogel? Pulverised isphagula husk, that’s what, and just about as chaffy as it’s possible to get”) too fleeting to set down. As with the first two volumes of Cromer’s story, this is fictional autobiography as big as life; Bildungsroman<em> </em>as immersive experience.</p><p>And what an autobiography it is: at once compelling and tedious; terrible and deeply, comically banal. John Cromer was born in the middle of the last century, a cover star for Nursery World magazine: “the sort of bonny baby who provokes knitting frenzies in susceptible persons”. All is conventionally well until illness strikes: aged just three, he contracts a rare form of arthritis that leaves him permanently disabled, confined at first to bed, then using a wheelchair. With the outside world no longer in reach, he’s forced to turn to an interior province that is, luckily for him and for us, both rich and wry.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/16/caret-by-adam-mars-jones-review-a-semi-infinite-novel">Continue reading...</a>

Not only do I feel that my body is letting me down … but I also feel that I am taking the place of another player who can give the team their all,” he said at the time. But with a chasm in his schedule caused by the absence of Test cricket until another visit to India in January he has found the lure of defending the World Cup title England won at home in 2019 irresistible.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/16/ben-stokes-returns-to-england-one-day-squad-ahead-of-cricket-world-cup">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Whether intended as a satire of bourgeois hypocrisy or not this tale of boorish nihilists announced von Trier as a consummate provocateur</p><p>Lars von Trier’s film from 1998 is re-released as part of the ongoing retrospective dedicated to this director, a film pioneeringly shot on digital video according to the minimalist guidelines of the Dogme 95 collective, which undoubtedly helped create an affordability-revolution in indie film-making. After a quarter of a century, The Idiots looks as cheerfully shallow, smug and manipulative as anything he has ever done, yet revisiting this needlingly insistent and epically tiresome film does bring into focus the way in which the debate around disability representation has changed, and also the subversive prank aesthetic that has to some degree governed the entire career of this unique film-maker.</p><p>The Idiots is about people playing tricks, gigglingly pretending to have cerebral palsy or some form of learning disability in order to freak out the uptight bourgeois in their restaurants and workplaces – and, of course, the cinema auditorium. They callously call it “spassing”, or use the English phrase “mentally retarded”. Karen (Bodil Jørgensen) is a deeply unhappy woman, in shock after a tragedy in her life which is explained only at the very end. Dining alone in a restaurant one day, she is intrigued at what appears to be a group of disabled adults there, minimally controlled by their carer and embarrassing the other diners, whose fastidious politeness prevents them from expressing their obvious disapproval and disgust. Karen goes back with these people to their house, where she finds they are simply pretending: a commune-cult led by the charismatic Stoffer (Jens Albinus) whose wealthy uncle owns their HQ and believes his nephew to be house-sitting the property prior to it being sold off.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/16/the-idiots-review-lars-von-triers-appalling-taste-dogme-satire-is-irritatingly-original">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A piercing memoir of growing up in 70s and 80s Yorkshire amid male violence, political protest and Pulp gigs</p><p>Yorkshire in the late 1970s, and women have been told not to go anywhere alone. While the Yorkshire Ripper mostly kills “prostitutes”, he has been known to make mistakes and murder “innocent” women too – those reckless enough to walk through the streets of Leeds or Halifax or Sheffield without a male escort. What were they thinking?</p><p>This is the terrifying context in which Catherine Taylor grew up, hitting puberty just as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/peter-sutcliffe" title="">Peter Sutcliffe</a> and the South Yorkshire Police combined to send a monstrous message about what it means to be female – utterly vulnerable but also entirely to blame. “Things happen after a Badedas bath,” coos a ubiquitous advert for a pricey foaming oil, managing to sound more like a threat than a promise. Taylor and her school friends dare each other to run through the local cemetery after dark to prove that they are not “frit” of the man stalking their nightmares and shaping their days. This is a rare moment of unsupervision – mostly they are ferried door to door by panicked parents.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/16/the-stirrings-by-catherine-taylor-review-coming-of-age-in-sheffield">Continue reading...</a>

## The Fraud by Zadie Smith review – from Victorian London to slavery in Jamaica

<p>Inspired by a celebrated court case, Smith’s dazzling historical novel combines deft writing and strenuous construction in a tale of literary London and the horrors of slavery</p><p>Zadie Smith has spent a long time concertedly not writing historical fiction. Determined to stay in the present, she has been on guard against the lures of the past. But history got her in the end, calling her down a grassy track to a Victorian village called Willesden. Thank goodness: we need minds like hers on the job. The Fraud, her sixth novel, is partly about an enslaved man on a Jamaican sugar plantation, and it’s a comedy: those two things at once. Few would dare; fewer could pull it off as Smith does here, mixing narrative delight with a vein of rapid, skimming satire as she sketches scenes of life in 19th-century England and the Caribbean.</p><p>The novel is a complicated mosaic of episodes from interleaved plots. Much of it follows a bizarre court case, “a tragicomedy of obscene length”, that gripped the British public in the 1870s. Sir Roger Tichborne, heir to a baronetcy and a fortune, was thought to have been lost at sea, but a cockney-born butcher in Australia declared himself to be the living Sir Roger and set out to London to prove his identity. The hearings extended over years.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/16/the-by-zadie-smith-review-from-victorian-london-to-slavery-in-jamaica">Continue reading...</a>

I suddenly understood how complicated and fallible we all are</p><p>The woman for whom my father left my mother when I was a baby was my stepmother for a time, but she wasn’t wicked – not like the ones Walt Disney had introduced me to as a child. She never locked me in a dungeon; there was no talking looking-glass. There were stories, however: stories of wrongdoing and battle lines drawn. I never attempted to verify them, but they became a feeling I couldn’t shake, lodged in some hard-to-reach place.</p><p>And so there was a small part of me that wondered if she knew dark magic after all. Perhaps I couldn’t detach myself from tales of evil stepmothers that were burrowed in the roots of popular culture. Perhaps my feelings came from what I heard had happened in the aftermath of the affair. But I’m sure, at least in part, it was my brain’s attempt to protect my young, bruised heart. She must have somehow lured my father away, I decided, unable to accept that it was an act of agency on his part.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/aug/16/a-moment-that-changed-me-i-heard-my-ex-stepmothers-voice-on-the-radio-and-learned-how-to-forgive">Continue reading...</a>

## Ending the tampon tax has just made retailers richer. Can we stop weaponising periods? | Laura Coryton

<p>I led the campaign to scrap VAT on period products, but some were omitted, and the savings on others are not being passed on to customers</p><p>In 2014, I started a petition to end the unfair and sexist “luxury” tax on period products. After years of campaigning, lobbying politicians, speaking with journalists, travelling the country to raise awareness, and amassing more than 300,000 signatures, there were two big breakthroughs. First, our campaign lobbied the government into establishing the tampon tax fund, through which almost £100m has been donated to female-focused charities. Second, in December 2020, Rishi Sunak, then chancellor, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/dec/31/tampon-tax-government-axes-vat-on-sanitary-products">announced he was “proud”</a> to finally end the 5% tax rate applied to period products.</p><p>Except there was a catch. Due to a simple administrative error, period pants (a reusable and environmentally friendly menstrual product) were wrongly categorised by HMRC as clothing rather than menstrual products. As a result, period pants are still being taxed today at 20%. We’ll never know why this happened, but I suspect a general lack of knowledge about periods probably didn’t help, and period stigma may have stopped anyone from correcting the error.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/16/tampon-tax-retailers-vat-period-products-customers">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There’s one rule for customers in the US, another for UK over key safety issue</p><p><strong>I seem to have stumbled across one of the car industry’s worst-kept safety secrets: several Mercedes-Benz models are prone to corroded and perforated subframes. These essentially attach the axle and suspension to the main frame. So when they fail, they fail big time. In the US, Mercedes has increased the length of its warranty; in the UK it is handing out no-liability “goodwill” payments to cover some repairs.</strong></p><p><strong>My 2011 car was found to have a corroded and holed rear subframe six weeks ago, but Mercedes is refusing to fund the repair. It seems outrageous that a well-known safety issue is not being addressed in the UK with a recall or a revised warranty.

<p>A metre-long cross between a piano and electric guitar, the harpejji is earning famous fans and millions in revenue. But can ‘chaos bells’ or an abacus-powered synth do the same?</p><p>In April 2012, Tim Meeks was at a music product trade show in Anaheim, California, when he got a tap on the shoulder. Stevie Wonder was in town. He had heard about the instrument Meeks had invented – a guitar-piano hybrid called the harpejji – and wanted to give it a go. Minutes later, the two men were hunched over the instrument flanked by five bodyguards, as Meeks moved the blind musician’s thumbs and forefingers across the fretboard to demonstrate how to play. “I love it,” said Wonder. “How soon can I get one?”</p><p>This was a turning point for Meeks, who has built and sold harpejjis from a workshop in Maryland since 2007. Initially, sales were slow. But a decade’s worth of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCnVrjdgyAk">harpejji performances by Wonder</a> – plus support from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5T-9RPW4pg">Jacob Collier</a>, Harry Connick Jr and jazz producer Cory Henry – have changed that. Now, Marcodi Musical Products, Meeks’ company, has sold nearly 1,500 of them, making him one of the few people alive to have invented a successful new instrument.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/16/if-stevie-wonder-wants-to-play-it-pay-attention-how-a-bizarre-new-instrument-found-unusual-success">Continue reading...</a>

## Plantwatch: how a liverwort captures its prey

<p>Some of the ancient plants have curious pouches that can trap tiny creatures</p><p>Liverworts are ancient green land plants that look like flattened liver-shaped pads, or they have stems and leaves and often get mistaken for mosses, their distant cousins.<br /><br />The liverworts <em>Pleurozia</em> and <em>Colura</em> also have curious leafy pouches that look uncannily like miniature carnivorous pitcher plants. These <a href="https://tinyurl.com/2r2u4ysf">liverwort pitchers are tiny</a>, featuring an opening and a lid that moves inwards on a hinge, but then closes tight. When the lid flips open it lets in a tiny creature but then shuts and prevents their escape, making a trap rather like the bladder trap of a carnivorous bladderwort plant. And another curious similarity to a typical carnivorous plant is how the liverworts lure their prey to the traps by some sort of unknown attraction.<br /><br />In the wild, these tiny liverwort pitchers can be full of microscopic single-celled <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1055/s-2000-9150">protozoa and other minuscule creatures</a>. But despite their elaborate traps, the liverworts do not have any digestive enzymes to break down their prey into food they can absorb. Instead, the captured inmates may simply die and get broken down by bacteria, a strategy also used by some carnivorous pitcher plants to feed off their prey.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/aug/16/plantwatch-how-a-liverwort-captures-its-prey">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Not all art is made to be hung on walls. From pinhole dioramas stashed in bollards to sculptures you need scuba gear to see, we meet the artists playing hide and seek with their viewers</p><p>Towards the end of June, five monumental sculptures in shimmering white marble were loaded on to a boat and dropped to the seabed off the Tuscan coast of Italy. Carved over three months by <a href="https://www.gonews.it/2023/06/27/museo-talamone-statue-casa-pesci/">five up-and-coming sculptors</a>, they were the latest contribution to a modern Atlantis – a drowned city of statues accessible only to free-divers or those with serious scuba kit.</p><p>In the commoditised art world, it doesn’t make sense to hide work away, yet from prehistoric cave painters to the 13th-century stonesmiths who carved gargoyles high on the spires of medieval cathedrals, artists and craftspeople have always done it – and still do. Such work isn’t sellable or even necessarily classifiable as art, but it has an energy and an integrity that touch you if you’re lucky enough to find it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/aug/16/deliberately-obscure-hidden-secret-public-art">Continue reading...</a>

## Russia is committing grave acts of ecocide in Ukraine – and the results will harm the whole world | Andriy Yermak and Margot Wallström

<p>By the war’s end, it will be too late to prevent the worst consequences of these terrible crimes. Global leaders must act now</p><ul><li>Andriy Yermak is head of the Office of the President of Ukraine; Margot Wallström is a former foreign minister of Sweden</li></ul><p>Robert Oppenheimer, the American physicist who led the team that developed the world’s first nuclear weapons, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lb13ynu3Iac">quoted from ancient Hindu scriptures</a> to illustrate his conflicting feelings about the forces his science unleashed: “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds,” he said. In his later years, Oppenheimer longed for a future “without nation states armed for war, and above all, a world without war”.</p><p>Yet there’s another kind of loss that Oppenheimer recognised only too clearly in his readings of the Bhagavad Gita, the ancient text he turned to after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. Humans now possess the power to destroy the world they live in.<br /><br />The people of Ukraine have grown cruelly familiar with war and death, inflicted on them by a nation state with vastly superior resources: they will never forget the human loss they have suffered in fighting to save their homeland. But Ukraine is also facing a <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/01/12/the-war-has-devastated-ukraines-environment-too">destruction of habitat and nature</a> on a scale that will reverberate far beyond its borders. While it is almost impossible to measure, the breadth and depth of this damage must be understood.<br /><br />Russia has taken deliberate aim at Ukraine’s environment: its rivers, forests and fields. Many of Ukraine’s natural reserves – its animal and sea life, water and <a href="https://wwfcee.org/our-offices/ukraine/assessing-the-environmental-impacts-of-the-war-in-ukraine">impressive biodiversity</a> – have been terribly damaged or polluted. Toxins leak from its damaged industries and infrastructure. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/03/russia-food-vladimir-putin-black-sea-grain-initiative-eu-aid">Global food security</a> is at risk. The world cannot afford to ignore this growing environmental threat.<br /><br />The overwhelming threat to Ukraine’s environment was highlighted in June, with the extraordinary collapse of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/09/visual-guide-ukraine-nova-kakhovka-dam-collapse">huge Nova Kakhovka dam</a>, which held back one of the biggest water reservoirs in Europe. This was no coincidental collapse: the dam was under Russian control when an explosion inside an internal passageway blew its concrete heart to pieces. This unleashed a catastrophic flood that wrecked over <a href="https://press.un.org/en/2023/sc15310.doc.htm">40 towns and villages</a> and one of the world’s most valuable agricultural regions. Tonnes of oil were spilled into the Dnipro River. An <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/ukraine-warns-floating-mines-disease-after-kakhovka-dam-collapse-2023-06-07/">uncountable number of landmines</a> were strewn into the river and the Black Sea, leading to toxic leakage.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/16/russia-ecocide-ukraine-world-war-crimes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For more than 60 years, the spiritual power of Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater’s signature work has stunned audiences including Obama. Here, company members explain what it’s like to dance a masterpiece</p><p><strong>Sylvia Waters</strong><strong>, former company dancer: </strong>I saw the first performance of Revelations, which was at the 92nd Street Y, New York, in 1960. At the time you are part of history you never realise it, of course. But I had a very visceral experience – deeply soulful. It was different from anything I’d seen a dance company do. That version of Revelations was almost an hour long and the audience reaction was explosive.</p><p><strong>Judith Jamison</strong><strong>, former company dancer and artistic director of </strong><strong>Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater</strong><strong> (AAADT), 1989-2011: </strong>I was at university in the early 60s. One of our assignments was to go see this company, Alvin Ailey. I had never heard of them but I was flabbergasted by the sight of this Black company. I think there might have been eight dancers, but they filled the stage. The next day in our improv class we were just copying everything we had seen.<br /><br /><strong>SW:</strong> I saw several versions between then and 1965. Alvin edited it down to 30 minutes and it became more succinct, clearer, crisper.<br /><br /><strong>JJ:</strong> It was a shower of blessings seeing Mr Ailey dance. He looked so muscular, not your usual “dancer”. He had a big chest and muscles, that whole macho thing. And he was gorgeous. But the dance was flowing like water. It takes your breath away.<br /><br /><strong>Constance Stamatiou</strong><strong>, dancer, AAADT: </strong>When I was a very little girl – four or five – I saw a TV show about Revelations. I was in awe, growing up in the 80s and seeing a company full of dancers that looked like me.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/16/alvin-ailey-american-dance-theater-revelations-interviews">Continue reading...</a>
