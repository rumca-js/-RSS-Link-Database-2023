		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/trust-stamp">Trust Stamp</a> has published a white paper playing up its facial attribute and image quality assessment API, which the vendor says and be integrated with "any" relevant facial recognition, presentation attack detection or age verification apps.

The tools are designed to make provide feedback when capturing facial images to systems (or, separately, people if the vendor's work on large language models pay off). Better automated image capture should make for better biometric enrollments and re-authentications, according to the document, which spends more time on face algorithms and less time describing image-capture quality.

The software tools incorporate and modify portions of <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/50912.html">ISO/IEC 29794-5</a>, but they also introduce new recommendations based on previous standardization efforts. A new international <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202302/comments-sought-from-working-group-members-on-biometric-face-image-quality-standard">standard for facial image quality</a> is currently under development by an ISO/IEC working group.

Focusing on face metrics in individual facial images can be computationally simpler than categorizing images by image quality – blurriness, for example, according to the white paper.

Trust Stamp claims in the white paper shared with <em>Biometric Update</em> that its software tools pull subject data from deep learning-based facial attribute classifiers, bringing to the surface the presence of facial hair, for instance. The company refers to the suite of tools as “FAIQA” (for “facial attribute and image quality assessment”).

The company sees its quality assessment tools addressing a number of use cases, including video-frame selection for both facial recognition and proof of liveness. Quality summarization can spotlight devices and systems that are underperforming.

They can also cull poor images to improve biometric accuracy.

		According to the Philippine News Agency, on Tuesday, the Philippine Statistics Authority in Negros Oriental (PSA-Negros Oriental), began piloting its civil registration services (CRS) app to authenticate national IDs with biometrics.

As an added security measure for the ID card program, the app is designed to determine whether IDs are valid. It can authenticate physical cards and ePhilIDs, according to PSA-Negros Oriental chief Ariel Fortuito in a statement to the <a href="https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1207860">Philippine News Agency</a>.

“Since the national ID cards no longer bear the signature of its owner, the CRS app can authenticate its information and other data stored in it, such as iris scans and biometrics,” said Fortuito.

As of late Tuesday, the PSA had spent three days testing roughly 25 clients' national ID cards using the system. Government agencies like <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/philippines-id-system-expands-across-government-agencies-and-social-benefit-programs">Social Security</a>, Philippine Health Insurance, and Government Service Insurance System already can use the system to validate identities, according to the article. It is also available to private institutions like banks.

Kiosks might be installed for ID authentication using QR codes, for instance, said Fortuito. The release of the app in Negros Oriental is set for next month.

		Northern summer is ending with contracts for several developers. Shufti Pro and Toss Bank announced new identity verification services. IDenfy is setting up verification for CheckYa, and Mitie says it's renewing a contract with one of the world's biggest football clubs.
<h2>Shufti launches advanced IDV service</h2>
Identity verification software maker <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/shufti-pro">Shufti Pro</a> announced that it is launching IDV services designed to help businesses reduce the risk of fraud and comply with KYC and AML regulations.

The service includes facial recognition, document verification and liveness detection. It uses both active verification including biometrics and passive verification including government databases and continuous monitoring of customer activity. It reportedly can verify identities in five seconds and provides 30 digital ID options for verification.

Businesses can use Shufti's IDV to validate customers' identities using documents such as passports, licenses, utility bills and national IDs. The company also has single sign-on and duplicate account checks.

Shufti has also formed a strategic partnership with Qtari fintech CWallet to ease digital financial transactions for customers in the Middle East.

CWallet provides a range of financial services for consumers and merchants in the region, and facilitated the approval of Shufti Pro by the Qatar Central Bank.

“We are keen on working with Shufti Pro on a long-term basis, including other territories that CWallet will be penetrating. We are confident that we can even bring more customers to Qatar. However, we need its support in hosting the solution locally,” says Michael Javier, founder and CEO of CWallet.

Shufti recently closed a $20 million series A round of funding led by Updata Partners, a growth-focused private equity firm, to continue developing IDV and compliance products. Shufti says it sells in 45 countries.
<h2>Mitie Group boasts contract extension with Arsenal FC</h2>
<a href="http://www.mitie.com/">Mitie</a>, a facilities management firm, reportedly has renewed its security contract with Arsenal Football Club for five years. The company's vetting unit, <a href="https://www.procius.com/">Procius</a>, will continue performing ID, right-to-work and resume checks. It will also verify education history.

Arsenal FC is one of the world's major football clubs and demands high levels or stadium security. Procius uses the MyCheck platform. It performs background, criminal record and disclosure and barring service (DBS) checks.

“We’re proud of our great relationship with a football club of Arsenal’s stature," says Jason Towse, a managing director at Mitie.
<h2>Bank and fintech announce IDV system successes and releases</h2>
South Korea's Toss Bank says that its IDV software has spotted 600 fake IDs in the six months since it was launched.

Toss executives say it has prevented 12 billion won (US$9 million) in fraud. The bank signed a deal with <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/alchera">Alchera</a> for remote identity verification <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/south-korean-bank-rolls-out-atm-withdrawals-with-alchera-facial-recognition">last year</a>.

The bank's ID system determines whether a photo ID is authentic. If the software determines a photo doesn't match or if it's been photographed from a phone screen or printed ID, it will restrict all transactions, including account enrollment, until the account can be verified. The bank claims a 94 percent accuracy rate.

At the same time, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/idenfy">iDenfy</a>, a Lithuania-based IDV software firm, is providing ID verification and built-in AML check for CheckYa, a California-based fintech for freelancers.

IDenfy will use face biometrics with liveness detection to screen creators against sanctions lists and global watchlists during onboarding. Its software supports documents from 300 countries and territories.

## AI use grows among retail stores, New York considers biometrics for liquor sales

		Move over passwords and PINs, retail stores are introducing new tech to help shoppers check out their goods, including biometrics and artificial intelligence.

<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/amazon">Amazon</a> is expanding its "pay-by-palm" technology Amazon One and its rapid rollout to numerous stores at once may give it a strong head start in biometric payments, <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/biometrics/2023/amazon-leans-into-consumer-love-biometrics-with-expanded-palm-payments/">according </a>to trade publication Pymnts. George Hanson, senior vice president and chief digital officer at Panera Bread which has been using Amazon One palm payment technology, says that the company’s guests are continuing their digital adoption, including using their mobile phones for payments.

One of the reasons behind its fast growth is consumer demand: More than half of consumers (51.7 percent) who have used biometrics for authentication say that they prefer this method, a January <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/study/consumer-authentication-preferences-online-banking-biometrics-digital-security">report </a>on consumer authentication preferences published by Pymnts and authentication provider  Entersekt found.

In July, Whole Foods <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/amazon-one-is-coming-to-all-whole-foods-stores">said </a>it will equip every one of its more than 500 stores with palm biometrics payment by the end of 2023. Back in May, Amazon One also <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/palm-id-verifies-in-us-for-alcohol-buys-and-in-beijing-for-subway-rides">introduced </a>a new age-verification function but it’s also rolling out other tech to prevent minors from buying liquor.

Last week, a liquor store in Seattle called Downtown Spirits became the first in the world to use Amazon’s Just Walk Out technology. An Amazon spokesperson clarified for Eater that the technology does not use biometric information but relies on a combination of computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning to allow stores to charge shoppers for what they pick off of shelves without having to go to a cashier. Previous Just Walk Out installations have used Amazon One devices for customers to scan their palm biometrics or a payment card on entry.

Amazon is not the only entity introducing new tech to limit alcohol consumption among minors.

New York senator James Skoufis has proposed a new bill that could introduce biometric scanners in his state's liquor and tobacco shops, StateScoop <a href="https://statescoop.com/fingerprints-face-scans-liquor-tobacco-new-york-biometric/">reports</a>. Skoufis cites examples such as Seattle’s CenturyLink and Safeco Fields, which use fingerprint scans for age verification during alcohol purchases

However, the bill, first <a href="http://nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2021/S1817">introduced </a>in 2021, doesn’t clarify who would store the biometric data. Unlike other states, such as Illinois and Washington, New York does not have a law regulating biometric data privacy and the bill is already attracting scrutiny from organizations such as the International Association of Privacy Professionals.

Meanwhile, companies are also deploying computer vision without biometrics in shops for unstaffed retail and self-checkouts.

Retail tech company<a href="https://aifi.com"> AiFi</a> believes that we are at the tipping point for autonomous retail to go mainstream thanks to AI, Forbes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenaquino/2023/08/15/aifi-is-using-ai-to-ensure-the-future-of-retail-is-autonomous-and-accessible-for-everyone/?sh=4055e7aa2bda">reports</a>. Its “advanced tracking algorithms” allow shoppers to purchase items in-store without having to wait in line or stop to scan or pay.

<a href="https://www.7-eleven.com/">7-Eleven</a> is jumping on the bandwagon. Its Australian stores plan to offer the My 7-Eleven App Pay and Go 2.0 which is expected to launch in 10 stores by the end of 2024. The app will be developed with Grabango and will leverage AI to enable customers the choice to skip the register, without the need to scan goods with their device, the companies said in an announcement.

7-Eleven has previously tested <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/201705/7-eleven-testing-palm-vein-authentication-for-payments-in-south-korea">palm-vein authentication</a> in its stores.

## Amazon takes a small BIPA win; ID scan provider for weed store accused

		Biometrics privacy cases in the U.S. state of Illinois continue to bubble to the surface.

In the newest U.S. biometrics privacy pleadings, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/amazon">Amazon</a> has eked out the merest fraction of victory in a case involving its face-scanning Photos service. And the use of ID verification by a national retail chain selling cannabis products has sparked a new suit involving <a href="https://www.tokenworks.com/">TokenWorks</a>, a verification software firm.

Amazon convinced a Cook County (Ill.) circuit court judge to dismiss the first of a two-count complaint under the state's Biometric Information Privacy Act. But its success is weaker than that, even.

In the first count, the plaintiffs, Angela Hogan and her minor son identified as B.H., have accused Amazon in a proposed class action (<a href="https://www.law360.com/articles/1709957/attachments/0">2021-CH-02330</a>, via <a href="https://www.law360.com/cybersecurity-privacy/articles/1709957?nl_pk=230a94d3-63ed-4db6-880a-970864e1adec&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=cybersecurity-privacy&amp;utm_content=2023-08-15&amp;read_main=1&amp;nlsidx=0&amp;nlaidx=0">Law360</a>) of violating BIPA by not complying with the company's own policies for storing biometric identifiers.

The Judge decided that the plaintiffs "allege no set of facts entitling recovery." This count was dismissed but without prejudice, meaning it can be amended and resubmitted.

Amazon's move to dismiss the second count failed outright, however. This count alleges that Amazon did not give the same high priority to securing biometric identifiers that it gives to other data deemed internally to be top priority to protect. That would be a BIPA violation, if proven.

The judge found that the plaintiffs had made their case that this complaint should be argued in court.

The TokenWorks case is about verifying the identity of visitors to stores owned by cannabis purveyor PharmaCann. Store security personnel check IDs using TokenWorks scanners. Both companies are named in the case.

In the proposed class action (<a href="https://www.law360.com/articles/1709854/attachments/0">2023-CH-07268</a>, also via <a href="https://www.law360.com/cybersecurity-privacy/articles/1709854/cannabis-co-id-scanner-co-hit-with-biometrics-suit">Law360</a>), also filed in the Cook County circuit court, plaintiffs Christopher Koltas and Kyle Morrell said that upon entering the store, their biometric data was captured, collected, stored and disseminated without their consent.

Most models of TokenWorks’ IDentiFake scanners do not acquire a second image for comparison, but the complaint alleges some versions integrate a camera and capture images for biometric matching.

What is more, the plaintiffs say TokenWorks has profited from PharmaCann's use of its scanners.

The case was filed August 9 and it is not known when it will be scheduled for a trial.

## Poll shows broad support for passwordless authentication but risks fly under the radar

<img alt="" class="attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="1152" src="https://d1sr9z1pdl3mb7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/17114352/phone-fingerprint-sensor-passkeys-scaled.jpg" width="2048" />
		Passwordless authentication is a “viable concept” for more than half (54 percent) of cybersecurity experts while 79 percent agree that passwords are evolving or becoming obsolete, according to a new survey interviewing attendees of the 2023 BlackHat USA cybersecurity conference.

Biometrics has become a popular choice for protecting passwords among cybersecurity experts: The majority of respondents (73 percent) said that they use multi-factor authentication (MFA) as an additional authentication method to secure their credentials and identity, with 57 percent saying that they use an authenticator app and 40 percent opting for biometrics.

Passkeys are also gaining traction, with 21 percent of respondents saying they already use them.

The poll was conducted by California-based access management company <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/delinea">Delinea</a>.

The survey is hardly representative of the wider business population. Delinea interviewed 100 business hall attendees of the cybersecurity conference, held last week in Las Vegas, U.S., including security team members, executives and IT administrators. But for Delinea’s Chief Security Scientist Joseph Carson the poll shows that “passwordless” is becoming more than a marketing term with easier additional forms of authentication pushing passwords into the background.

“This takes on increased significance when 75 percent of respondents also acknowledged that the fastest way to get access to a network is through social engineering or stolen identities and passwords,” says Carson. “The quicker organizations and end users alike can evolve their identity and access security beyond passwords, the safer we’ll be as a society."

Not everyone is satisfied with current passwordless solutions, however, with some experts warning of misconfigurations and hidden app vulnerabilities.

Speaking during the BSides meetings, organized on the sidelines of the BlackHat Conference, Aldo Salas, application security lead at <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/hypr-corp">Hypr</a>, noted that some passwordless implementations can be poorly configured, cybersecurity trade publication SC Media <a href="https://www.scmagazine.com/news/bsides-las-vegas-roundup-passwordless-misconfigurations-and-hidden-app-vulnerabilities">reports</a>.

"Passwordless is not less secure than passwords," Salas says. "But there are vulnerabilities, and nobody is talking about them." Following the WebAuthn specification, for example, does not guarantee the security of access credentials.

Poor coding practices are also a major reason why security flaws can be missed during vulnerability scans and software composition analysis (SCA), according to Yotam Perkal, head of vulnerability research at Rezilion.

		India’s central bank is planning a pilot program for a digital platform intended to extend the country’s digital public infrastructure and digital identity system to loans for easier credit applications.

The <a href="https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=56174">Public Tech Platform for Frictionless Credit</a> proposed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will bring together data required for credit appraisals, but held by different government bodies, account aggregators, banks, credit information companies and digital identity authorities, according to a bank announcement. This will enable rule-based lending through an open API that financial service providers can connect to.

The pilot will include credit card loans, dairy loans, loans to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises without collateral, and personal and home loans. To facilitate these, the platform will enable connections to the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202304/proposed-change-to-aadhaar-authentication-rule-raises-data-privacy-issues">Aadhaar e-KYC service</a>, Aadhaar e-signatures and various databases.

The phrase “open banking” is not used in the announcement, but the use of an open API and digital identities to facilitate third-party access to financial data is commonly associated with the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/open-banking">open banking</a> concept.

The RBI hopes the platform will increase the efficiency of loans applications and approval, reduce costs and improve access to credit.

The platform is being developed by RBI subsidiary Reserve Bank Innovation Hub, and the pilot is scheduled to begin this Thursday, August 17.

		Apple may be inching closer to including Face ID biometrics in its MacBook laptops, based on a newly granted patent.

Tuesday, the U.S. patent office granted Apple patent <a href="https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/11727718">11727718</a>, “Light Recognition Module for Determining a User of a Computing Device.” It describes a biometric authentication module built into the MacBook screen's notch.

As MacBooks are typically thin, the imaging hardware would need to be compact without sacrificing accuracy and user recognition, Apple notes in the filing.

On the same day, an Apple patent application was published for emotion detection. The filing, <a href="https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/11727724">11727724</a>, outlines software that estimates emotions in images of faces and imbues avatars with that data.

There is controversy around the idea that algorithms could accurately discern emotions.

The company says it could obtain a latent vector for the image by using an expression convolutional neural network.

Apple also revealed that the algorithm used for estimating emotions may rely on data from some unusual sources. The company lists demographic data, location, phone number, home addresses, social media IDs and even health and fitness data. The collection of this private data needs to comply with local privacy laws, the patent filing notes.

		The UK government is recruiting new advisors for its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/biometrics-and-forensics-ethics-group">Biometrics and Forensic Ethics Group</a> (BFEG) which provides recommendations on handling biometric data, forensic material and large data sets used in machine learning.

The UK oversight group <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/recruiting-biometrics-and-forensics-ethics-group">plans</a> to hire six new members with experience in domains such as biometrics, AI, data and medical ethics, law and social sciences. The group will provide Home Office ministers with independent ethical advice during the next three years. The application deadline is September 11, 2023.

The news comes amid a wider reshuffle of UK government agencies working on biometrics issues which will see the position of Biometrics and Surveillance Camera Commissioner for England and Wales abolished due to the introduction of the new Data Protection and Digital Information Bill. The decision has <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/scottish-biometrics-commissioner-objects-to-proposals-to-abolish-position-of-uk-counterpart">invited criticism</a> from the likes of the Scottish Biometrics Commissioner Dr. Brian Plastow who argues that removing the office will give the police a “carte blanche to do whatever they like in the biometrics space.”

UK Surveillance Camera and Biometrics Commissioner <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/uk-biometrics-commissioner-resigns-in-anticipation-of-roles-elimination">Fraser Sampson stepped down</a> last week noting that his roles would be rendered irrelevant by the new law which is expected to arrive in early 2024 or later.

The <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/biometrics-and-forensics-ethics-group">BFEG</a> was created to complement the Biometrics and Surveillance Camera Commissioner and the Forensic Science Regulator. In its annual report published in March this year, the oversight group <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202303/uk-biometric-ethics-group-to-consider-implications-of-gait-and-voice-recognition">highlighted gait and voice biometrics</a> as a new priority.

Also in the UK, Professor Niamh Nic Daéid, director of the University of Dundee’s Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic Science, has been appointed to the advisory board of the<a href="https://www.biometricscommissioner.scot/"> Scottish Biometrics Commissioner</a>. The office’s function is to ensure that biometric data gathered by Scottish police forces is handled according to law.

		Third-party reproduction clinic Lucina Egg Bank recently announced the introduction of Lucina ReflEggction, a platform that uses face biometrics to match clients with donors who have similar facial features.

Many clients look for donors who share similar features with them. The ReflEggction platform analyzes donors' faces from a database and presents the ones who look the most like the intended parents. This allows the matching process to go beyond basic phenotypical criteria such as hair and eye color, height, skin tone, and blood group, and the company claims high accuracy in matching.

The platform creates an anonymized biometric template of a users' face and can generate potential donor matches in under five seconds. Personal data takes on extra sensitivity in the context of reproduction, as the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202207/ftc-fires-a-shot-across-the-bow-of-anyone-wanting-to-sell-personal-reproductive-data">FTC made clear</a> in a statement last year.

The U.S. is the largest fertility industry in the world and the use of donor eggs is common. According to the <a href="https://nccd.cdc.gov/drh_art/rdPage.aspx?rdReport=DRH_ART.ClinicInfo&amp;rdRequestForward=True&amp;ClinicId=9999&amp;ShowNational=1">CDC</a>, almost 24 percent of all in vitro fertilization cycles for patients over the age of 40 involve donor eggs. The egg bank's platform is the first in the U.S. to feature facial recognition, according to the announcement, though Lucina Egg Bank serves clients across the globe, and the process could perhaps be better described as facial analysis.

"It's an empowering, time-saving solution that we believe will redefine the future of third-party reproduction," said President and chief medical officer of Lucina Egg Bank, Dr. David Harari. "Lucina <a href="https://lucinaeggbank.com/find-egg-donors-with-lucina-refleggction/">ReflEggction</a> simplifies, accelerates, and personalizes the selection process, ensuring our patients find their perfect match quickly and securely."

		<em>By John Cullen, Strategic Marketing Director Digital Identity at <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en">Thales</a></em>

There are countless reasons why we would have to prove our age in day-to-day life. Whether it’s buying a bottle of wine from the supermarket, entering a nightclub, applying for a job, accessing certain medical services or creating an age-restricted social media account – the list is endless. Many of us will be used to using a passport or driver’s license in person, or entering our date of birth online in order to prove our age.

“Digital identities” and digital wallets have the potential to transform age verification as we know it. While standard physical IDs aren’t going anywhere, digital wallets offer a safe, secure, and streamlined option when it comes to identity verification processes, complementing the likes of driver’s licences, national IDs and passports.

It doesn’t end there. <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202204/expect-digital-id-to-balloon-in-users-and-revenue-by-2026-juniper-research">The number of users using digital IDs is predicted to increase by more than 50 percent from 4.2 billion in 2022 to 6.5 billion in 2026</a>. Based on this trajectory of growth, digital identities will likely become even more mainstream in our daily lives in the near future. Not only will they be able to hold even more essential documents and passes, but they will have the capability to prove one’s identity or specific attributes, such as one’s date of birth. In this case, the aim would simply be to confirm that the user is old enough to access certain services.

In an age where data privacy is of the upmost importance, we look at how digital identities can both simplify and secure the age verification process.
<h2>They’re incredibly secure and private</h2>
One’s data and personal information is increasingly valuable, and consumers are rightfully protective over the access, use, and security of it. Many can also appreciate the risks associated with it getting into the wrong hands. However, thanks to multi-layer security mechanisms, the private or personal information stored on a digital ID is safe and incredibly well protected by various layers of data encryption and multi-factor authentication, making the chances of data and identity theft as improbable as possible.

Biometric-enabled digital IDs bring another layer of security too, meaning it requires fingerprint authentication and/or facial recognition to verify the user. This is a far more secure and convenient authentication method in comparison to the likes of a password. Biometric authentication doesn’t require you to remember a complicated passphrase – you simply scan your face or fingerprint – combining both security and convenience for the user.
<h2>You don’t need to overshare</h2>
There’s a misconception that you have to give up all your data when using a digital ID. While it’s true that a Digital ID can hold vast quantities of data to be used in any given situation, it can be incredibly precise and granular in the data that it uses for the specific age verification scenario at hand. A digital ID simply verifies that you’re over the required age threshold, without sharing your actual age or date of birth. Added to this, the service provider will not be able to obtain a copy of your ID document.
<h2>They’re very accessible</h2>
Digital IDs have an incredibly user-friendly interface. In fact, digital IDs are not time-consuming or arduous in the slightest. Your digital ID can simply be pre-loaded with your age credentials via easy, biometric authentication. When you wish to share this information, a quick scan of your face or fingerprint on the smart phone will then launch a QR code from the digital wallet. This QR code can then be scanned by the service provider’s device to verify that you are above the desired age threshold thanks to the relevant data being stored in the wallet – it’s as simple as that.
<h2>They’re a robust online verification method</h2>
Currently, inadequate verification methods mean there’s room to cheat the system. Users can easily input the wrong DOB or provide fake credentials to access certain websites or create online accounts. Processors also have to deal with human error where the individual checking the ID in person could misread the date of birth, or fail to realize when someone is impersonating someone else with an ID that isn’t theirs.

Digital IDs offer a robust and trusted means to accurately ensure users meet the required age limits. This is particularly the case for online retailers or service providers, where there is no in-person age verification, like for online medical prescriptions, gambling sites, and adult-only content, where users are comfortable verifying their age, but may want to otherwise remain anonymous.
<h2>The final word</h2>
While it’s clear that this emerging technology has tonnes of potential, it’s worth remembering that digital IDs will be a means of complementing physical IDs, rather than replacing them entirely. Expect both forms of ID to be accepted going forwards. With more and more services becoming available online, Digital IDs will be an enabler of robust age verification for countless essential services, while also making processes more streamlined in the physical world.
