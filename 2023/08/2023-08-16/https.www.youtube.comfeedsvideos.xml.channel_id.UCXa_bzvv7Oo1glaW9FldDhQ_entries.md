Mimimi Games has, by now, established itself as one of the best in the business when it comes to real-time stealth tactics, and with Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, it once again proves why it’s worthy of that praise, just as it did with Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun and Desperados 3. 

Not only does it boast a rich and wonderfully realized pirate fantasy setting (where things are not always what you’d expect them to be), it also delivers a standout stealth and tactics experience, combining excellently designed stealth sandbox maps with a tight and clearly communicated set of rules, an emphasis on experimentation and creativity, and a varied and inventive cast of characters that’s a joy to play as, with no exceptions. 

For fans of the genre, this one is an incredibly easy game to recommend.

Bethesda is ploughing heaps of time, money, and resources into its first new IP in 25 years. Starfield is stuffed with gargantuan promise – 1000 fully explorable planets across a vast 100 star system, deep character customization, unspooling narrative, gorgeous visuals, base building, FPS, space combat, and enough exploration to last a lifetime, there’s certainly heaps of pressure on Starfield to be a platform seller. 

Will it knock The Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom of its perch though? Tears of the Kingdom has sold remarkably well, shifting 3 million units in its first three days. The odds seem stacked against it, but if any upcoming game can rival the latest Zelda for depth and intrigue, it’s Starfield.

Laced with mystery and intrigue is Mortal Kombat 1’s trailer for the Banished. Of most prominence is long-time MK fighter Reptile – this time in shapeshifting human and reptilian form. He appears on a crusade with Kung Lao, Johnny Cage, Ashrah, Kenshi, and Baraka, although the exact motivation behind these characters’ actions is unclear. 

This video attempts to establish some grounded theory as to what exactly is going on. Mortal Kombat has a history of complex, cinematic storytelling, and Mortal Kombat 1’s rebooted timeline will be no different. One thing’s for certain – the fatal blows dealt in the Banished trailer are incredible; together with an immersive story and arguably the finest starting roster of any Mortal Kombat game, MK1 is shaping up to be rather special.
