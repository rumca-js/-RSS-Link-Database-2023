Likewise, it may take a bit of fighting spirit to make it through the slow and arduous dungeons and some of the bloated and jarring plot, yet it captures the intrepid lives of people who travel the world, beating each other up for fame and fortune in charming and touching ways that are enhanced by its Toy Story-style innocence.
