Starfield is stuffed with gargantuan promise \u2013 1000 fully explorable planets across a vast 100 star system, deep character customization, unspooling narrative, gorgeous visuals, base building, FPS, space combat, and enough exploration to last a lifetime, there\u2019s certainly heaps of pressure on Starfield to be a platform seller. \n\nWill it knock The Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom of its perch though? Tears of the Kingdom has sold remarkably well, shifting 3 million units in its first three days.
