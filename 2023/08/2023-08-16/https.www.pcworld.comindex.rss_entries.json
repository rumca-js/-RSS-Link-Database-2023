It packs the incredible contrast and realism of OLED in a 34-inch widescreen panel, yet it&rsquo;s priced at just $1,099. That&rsquo;s not inexpensive, but it&rsquo;s better value than other OLED monitors available right now.</p>\n\n<p>Image quality is where it stands out. It delivers a vivid, immersive, rich experience with deep black levels and bright highlights, which are enhanced by the display&rsquo;s glossy finish. Movies and games seem nearly three-dimensional&mdash;as if you&rsquo;re looking through a window, not staring at a monitor.</p>\n\n<p>What&rsquo;s the catch? The monitor is not bright, especially in SDR, so it&rsquo;s a bad choice for a brightly lit room. We also noticed the OLED panel has trouble rendering small fonts smoothly. These are minor issues, though, and shouldn&rsquo;t trouble most owners.</p>\n\n<p>This monitor targets gamers, so it offers an enhanced refresh rate of up to 165Hz and supports AMD FreeSync Premium Pro for smooth frame pacing in games. However, its excellent image quality will be impressive in everyday use, as well.</p>\n\n<p>It has good connectivity, with two DisplayPort inputs and one HDMI, as well as a USB-A hub with four ports. There&rsquo;s even a healthy range of calibration options that help demanding owners dial in the image to their personal specifications.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1440675/alienware-aw3423dwf-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlienware AW3423DWF review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ad page-ad has-ad-prefix ad-article\"></div>\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-separator\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart-item product-chart-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper--title product-chart-title \" id=\"aoc-cu34g2x-best-budget-ultrawide\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAOC CU34G2X &ndash; Best budget ultrawide\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"large-pro-cons-product-chart-section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproduct-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper--large\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"AOC CU34G2X - Best budget ultrawide\" class=\"product-chart-item__image\" height=\"592\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/61-ke7QpxL._AC_SL1000_.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"901\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-columns\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tGaming monitor in ultrawide 21:9 format\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tImpressive gaming performance\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tLarge 34-inch curved panel\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tErgonomic adjustment options\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tHigh power consumption\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__information \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-label\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>Ultrawide monitors have many perks, but low pricing is not among them. Fortunately, budget shoppers have one good option: the AOC CU34G2X, which retails at or below $349.99.</p>\n\n<p>This monitor has a 34-inch ultrawide VA panel that, by most measures, performs surprisingly close to more expensive alternatives. It provides a good contrast ratio and delivers vivid color performance. It also has the same 3440&times;1440 resolution as the other monitors on this list, so it looks just as sharp. In truth, less demanding shoppers may find it difficult to notice any difference between this monitor and more expensive options like the Asus ProArt PA348CV.</p>\n\n<p>The AOC CU34G2X is marketed as a gaming monitor and has an enhanced refresh rate of up to 144Hz. It doesn&rsquo;t officially support AMD FreeSync or Nvidia G-Sync, however, so gamers may have mixed results when trying to use these adaptive sync standards.</p>\n\n<p>Though it punches above its price in image quality, the AOC CU34G2X&rsquo;s design looks cheap. It leans a bit too hard on an aggressive red-and-black gaming theme. That will annoy shoppers who prefer a calmer, less obtrusive look.</p>\n\n<p>Connectivity is great, though, with two HDMI and two DisplayPort inputs plus a four-port USB-A hub. The monitor also has a height adjustable stand, a must-have perk that isn&rsquo;t guaranteed on budget ultrawide monitors.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/804151/aoc-cu34g2x-gaming-monitor-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAOC CU34G2X review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ad page-ad has-ad-prefix ad-article\"></div>\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-separator\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart-item product-chart-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper--title product-chart-title \" id=\"lg-ultragear-34gn850-best-budget-ultrawide-for-gamers\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLG Ultragear 34GN850 &ndash; Best budget ultrawide for gamers\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"large-pro-cons-product-chart-section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproduct-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper--large\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"LG Ultragear 34GN850 - Best budget ultrawide for gamers\" class=\"product-chart-item__image\" height=\"958\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/LG-Ultragear-34GN850-03.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"800\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-columns\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t21:9 panel with a 34-inch screen\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tCurved monitor\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tImpressive gaming performance\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tErgonomic adjustment options\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tOnly average power consumption\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tExpensive\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__information \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-label\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"not-amp\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-34gn850-b-gaming-monitor&amp;xcust=2-1-1470449-6-804143-10875&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$750.00 at  LG</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>The LG Ultragear 34GN850-B, released in 2020, was once the king of ultrawide gaming. It was dethroned by Alienware&rsquo;s AW3423DWF&mdash;and as a result LG has slashed the price. Originally $999.99, this monitor is now available for $699.99 (and sometimes less).</p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s great news. Although surpassed by the Alienware, LG&rsquo;s Ultragear 34GN850-B is an attractive monitor with excellent color performance, good image clarity, and a bright, vivid picture. It has an enhanced refresh rate of up to 144Hz (with a 160Hz overclocked mode) and supports both AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync for smooth gameplay.</p>\n\n<p>Its weakness? Contrast. The IPS panel scores lower in contrast than other monitors on this list, including the Asus ProArt PA348CV, which also has an IPS panel.

Priced at just $729.99, it&rsquo;s towards the low end of pricing for a professional ultrawide display&mdash;yet its performance is near the top of the pack.</p>\n\n<p>This monitor has a wide color gamut, excellent color accuracy, and a virtual buffet of image-quality calibration features that let users precisely tune the image. It&rsquo;s also a bright and vivid monitor, making it easy to use in nearly any office. Admittedly, it doesn&rsquo;t set any records in image quality tests&mdash;but it ties or comes close to alternatives that are hundreds of dollars more expensive.</p>\n\n<p>Asus throws in a useful USB-C port that supports DisplayPort Alternate Mode and delivers 90 watts of USB Power Delivery. It also drives a USB-A hub with four downstream ports. Additional video connectivity includes two HDMI and one DisplayPort for a total of four input options.</p>\n\n<p>Surprisingly, Asus throws in an enhanced refresh rate up to 120Hz. It&rsquo;s not sold as a gaming monitor, but it can handle gaming well enough.

This leaves shoppers with fewer options. Most ultrawide monitors have a 34-inch panel with a resolution of 3440&times;1440, and similar connectivity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, these monitors can differ in several key areas. Here&rsquo;s what to look for.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"panel-type-is-a-big-deal\">Panel type is a big deal</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultrawide monitors offer less choice in some regards but that script is flipped when it comes to panel type. Ultrawide monitors come in a variety of panel types: IPS, VA, and OLED.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>IPS panels are common in mid-range and premium ultrawide monitors. This panel type delivers great color performance, high maximum brightness, superb sharpness, and good motion performance. It&rsquo;s weak in contrast, however, which can disappoint when viewing TV shows or movies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>VA panels are typically a budget option, though some are found in premium ultrawide monitors. They have better contrast than IPS panels and deliver similar color performance and brightness&mdash;however, budget VA panels tend to be merely okay in these areas. Most VA panels fall short in motion performance and may look blurry when playing fast-paced games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>OLED is king of the hill. It leads in color, contrast, and motion performance. Sharpness is often slightly reduced compared to IPS and VA, but most people will find it a minor downgrade. OLED also is the best choice for HDR.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, OLED is better than IPS, and IPS is better than VA. However, some people might prefer VA over IPS because it has a better contrast ratio and looks darker in dark content.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"a-height-adjustable-stand-is-a-must-have\">A height-adjustable stand is a must-have</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All the monitors on this list provide an ergonomic stand that adjusts for height, tilt, and swivel. This is a must-have feature, but one that isn&rsquo;t found on the least expensive ultrawide monitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As tempting as it may be to save money on a budget model without a height-adjustable stand, you would regret it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultrawide monitors are bulky and tend to require a larger, heavier stand, which in turn makes them more difficult to place on an elevated platform. The old college trick of sticking a monitor on a shoe box won&rsquo;t work.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"look-for-usb-c-but-dont-expect-it\">Look for USB-C, but don&rsquo;t expect it</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>USB-C compatibility is an excellent feature, and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/612470/you-should-buy-a-usb-c-hub-monitor-heres-what-you-need-to-know.html\">USB-C hub monitors</a> can clear away tons of clutter on your desk. Unfortunately, many ultrawide monitors don&rsquo;t support USB-C yet, or have limitations that detract from the USB-C port&rsquo;s usefulness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asus&rsquo;s ProArt PA348CV, our favorite ultrawide for professionals, is one exception. It has a USB-C port with up to 90 watts of Power Delivery, and the port drives a USB-A hub with four downstream ports.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dell, HP, and BenQ also offer ultrawide monitors with USB-C. Most of these lack an enhanced refresh rate, however, and they&rsquo;re typically more expensive than the Asus.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pricing-is-important-and-can-swing-wildly\">Pricing is important&mdash;and can swing wildly</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Monitor pricing is always important, but it&rsquo;s key for ultrawide monitors. Although very expensive at MSRP, ultrawide monitors routinely see huge price cuts during seasonal sales. They also receive major semi-permanent price cuts later in their life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The LG Ultragear 34GN850-B is an example of this. Originally sold for $999.99, it&rsquo;s now routinely available for $699.99, and went as low as $599.99 during Amazon&rsquo;s Black Friday sale. That&rsquo;s a 40 percent reduction in price! Waiting for a deal can save you hundreds.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"dont-buy-an-ultrawide-for-console-gaming\">Don&rsquo;t buy an ultrawide for console gaming</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A quick word of warning: You should not buy an ultrawide monitor if you plan to connect a game console frequently. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Game consoles don&rsquo;t support ultrawide aspect ratios, so you&rsquo;ll see black bars on either side of the image. That&rsquo;s unattractive and wastes the monitor&rsquo;s potential. It&rsquo;s best to stick with a widescreen monitor if console gaming is a priority.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-we-test-monitors\">How we test monitors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>PC World&rsquo;s team of staff and freelance reviewers conduct in-depth testing to compare monitors across a wide range of categories and price points. We test dozens of monitors each year to find the best pick for every category and price point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our testing uses a SpyderXElite color calibration tool. It delivers objective, unbiased measurements for a wide range of metrics including brightness, contrast, color gamut, color accuracy, color temperature, and gamma. Results are recorded and logged for future comparison. This allows our experts to easily compare many monitors at once and eliminates subjective bias from the results.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-block faq-block\"><h2 class=\"faq-block-title\" id=\"faq\"> FAQ </h2><hr class=\"block-horizotal-divider\" />\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">1.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What size of ultrawide gaming monitor is best?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>Most ultrawide monitors have a 34-inch panel with a 21:9 aspect ratio, which is the best option for most gamers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some ultrawide monitors are available in larger sizes, but these typically aren&rsquo;t the best choice for gamers. Many do not support high refresh rates. Those that do are expensive and often use the same 3440&times;1440 resolution found on smaller ultrawide monitors, which means they appear less sharp than a 34-inch display.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">2.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What is the best resolution for an ultrawide monitor?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>Nearly all 34-inch ultrawide monitors have a display resolution of 3440&times;1440. This is an excellent choice for gamers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s sharp enough to look impressive in modern games. However, this resolution remains significantly lower in total pixel count than 4K, which makes it less demanding on graphics hardware. That&rsquo;s good news if you have a mid-range graphics card like an <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394228/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review.html\">Nvidia RTX 3060</a> or <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394984/amd-radeon-rx-6600-xt-review-asus-rog-strix.html\">AMD Radeon RX 6650XT</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Larger 38-inch models have a higher resolution of 3840&times;1660&mdash;however, nearly all these monitors lack support for high refresh rates, making them a bad choice for gamers. LG offers <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-34WK95U-W-ultrawide-monitor&amp;xcust=2-1-1470449-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">a line of 34-inch 5K2K ultrawide monitors with 5120&times;2160 resolution</a>, but this line also lacks support for enhanced refresh rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few new 45-inch ultrawide monitors are available with 3440&times;1440 resolution. This can be a problem, because stretching the same resolution across a much larger display reduces sharpness. We recommend 3440&times;1440 only for 34-inch ultrawide monitors.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">3.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What&rsquo;s the best refresh rate for an ultrawide gaming monitor?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>A refresh rate of 144Hz to 165Hz is ideal for most ultrawide gaming monitors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Very few ultrawide monitors exceed this refresh rate, and those that do are too expensive to make it a good value.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, gamers shopping for an ultrawide gaming monitor are likely to prefer immersive and graphically demanding games that make it difficult to see the full benefit of a refresh rate above 144Hz. You&rsquo;ll need a high-end video card, like an RTX 3080 or AMD Radeon 6800, to drive most ultrawide gaming monitors at frame rates above 144 frames per second.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">4.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Does an ultrawide gaming monitor need HDR?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>HDR isn&rsquo;t a must-have for an ultrawide gaming monitor, but it&rsquo;s a nice addition.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gaming is a great use case for HDR&mdash;arguably the best, in fact&mdash;and it can deliver improved image quality.

At the same time, the Redmond company is making a new update available that is supposed to fix the problem. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"bug-in-clickonce-applications\">Bug in ClickOnce applications</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ClickOnce is a Microsoft deployment technology that allows developers to create Windows-based applications and distribute them over the internet or their own networks. The Windows 10 bug could cause users to be prompted to install an application that is already installed and trusted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using the &ldquo;Known-Issue-Rollback&rdquo; feature built into modern versions of Windows, Microsoft has withdrawn the updates that could have triggered the bug. The KIR feature restores PCs to the state they were in before the now-withdrawn patches were installed. Specifically, two Windows updates are affected: one released in July (KB5028244), the other as part of Patch Day in August.

Take for example Windows shortcuts. So many exist that I&rsquo;m still learning new ones, decades later. The latest one I just stumbled across: If you hold Ctrl while Windows Task Manager is open, it freezes the real-time updates about your open apps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This tip comes courtesy of <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/JenMsft/status/1691563112175165724?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=2-1-2033628-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jen Gentleman</a>, a Windows engineering team member who tweets about these kinds of little tricks. Spotted by <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/16/23834125/microsoft-windows-task-manager-pause-shortcut&amp;xcust=2-1-2033628-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Verge</a>, this keyboard shortcut works in both Windows 10 and 11, and is handy for when you&rsquo;re trying to click on a Task Manager process and it jumps to a different position in the list (or momentarily disappears). Holding Ctrl stops the window from continually refreshing. You&rsquo;re still able to otherwise interact with the apps, like selecting them or clicking the dropdown arrow to get more details.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2033632\" height=\"1104\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-11.png\" width=\"1009\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re a grizzled veteran of Windows and are tempted to facepalm that you never discovered this on your own&mdash;like by simply messing around and pressing the different modifier keys to see what happened&mdash;don&rsquo;t worry, I got you covered.

They speed up basic tasks in Windows by a lot, and they&rsquo;re pretty easy to memorize after enough repetition.

Creative users who use image editing tools on Ryzen PCs, though, may have a lot to worry about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gamers should be relatively unscathed, according to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-inception-benchmarks&amp;xcust=2-1-2033369-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">early tests performed by Phoronix</a>, whose tests noted <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2029412/intel-downfall-bug-fix-drastically-lowers-performance-tests-find.html\">sharp performance drops in Intel Core</a> processors in server-side applications after <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2025589/downfall-serious-security-vulnerability-in-billions-of-intel-cpus-how-to-protect-yourself.html\">the related &ldquo;Downfall&rdquo; bug</a> was unearthed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though discovered at about the same time, the two vulnerabilities appear to be different. Downfall allows an attacker sharing the same Intel-based PC as the victim to attack other users, theoretically gaining access to their data. Inception also forces a Ryzen PC to leak data, but the primary attack vector is thought to be malware. (Downfall can also be exploited by malware.) In the case of AMD&rsquo;s Inception bug, however, all Ryzen and Epyc CPUs are affected; Intel&rsquo;s 12th- and 13th-generation Core chips aren&rsquo;t vulnerable to Downfall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For consumers, the threat of both bugs is real, though a user is statistically unlikely to be targeted. Until the mitigations for both bugs are actually designed in to future AMD and Intel processors, however, the microcode has to be applied via a patch. It&rsquo;s this patch that can slow down a PC, sometimes dramatically.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"ryzen 9 7950x3d chip and box\" class=\"wp-image-1796111\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ryzen-9-7950x3d-chip-and-box.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Willis Lai/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Phoronix chose different benchmarks to measure Downfall&rsquo;s impact than it did with the AMD Inception vulnerability. The Downfall tests focused on server-side benchmarks. With Inception, however, Phoronix also ran several consumer-friendly benchmarks on a <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1074246/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-review.html\">Ryzen 9 7950X processor</a> to measure the microcode&rsquo;s impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There appears to be one major caveat to the Phoronix tests. The Ryzen tests were run under what Phoronix calls the &ldquo;safe RET no microcode&rdquo; &mdash; a &ldquo;purely kernel-based mitigation while using the prior Family 19h CPU microcode <em>without the Inception mitigation</em> there.&rdquo; (Our emphasis.) That&rsquo;s in part because AMD is rolling out new microcode for Zen 3 and Zen 4 processors, according to Phoronix, but Zen 1 and Zen 2 chips only require a kernel-only mitigation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, Phoronix ran a series of tests on an AMD Epyc processor, where the mitigation <em>was</em> available. When Phoronix ran the results for &ldquo;safe RET no microcode&rdquo; and &ldquo;safe RET&rdquo; [with the microcode patch] the results were virtually identical. Take that as you will.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-half-width is-float-right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"keep-malware-off-your-pc-with-the-best-antivirus-available\">\n\t\t\t\t\tkeep malware off your pc with the best antivirus available\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"norton-360-deluxe\">Norton 360 Deluxe</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Norton 360 Deluxe\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/norton.png\" width=\"1536\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__pricing-details  \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://software.pcworld.com/p37061-norton_360_deluxe_2022_3-d_1-yr\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$19.99 at  PCWorld Software Store</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>The good news? So far, Ryzen gaming doesn&rsquo;t seem to be affected, with a statistically insignificant 1 percent difference using 3DMark&rsquo;s &ldquo;Wild Life&rdquo; benchmark. Compression using 7Zip demonstrated a 5 percent drop in performance. The time to compile a Linux kernel took 8 percent longer after the microcode was applied. (Phoronix has many more tests we don&rsquo;t summarize here.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like Downfall, though, users who work with photography and image-editing apps have reason to be concerned. Though Phoronix&rsquo;s tests only found a 4 percent decrease using the Darktable RAW photography software, GIMP performance was strongly affected. GIMP, a Photoshop competitor, saw performance plunge by 28 percent using GIMP&rsquo;s rotate tool. Phoronix noticed a similar 24 percent drop when using the unsharp-mask command as well, and the time to resize an image took 18 percent longer when the microcode patch was applied.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s possible that both AMD and Intel will be able to optimize the performance of their respective chips over time. But for now, creatives have to be sweating out these two latest bugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><strong>Further reading: </strong><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2025589/downfall-serious-security-vulnerability-in-billions-of-intel-cpus-how-to-protect-yourself.html\">Intel &lsquo;Downfall&rsquo;: Severe flaw in billions of CPUs leaks passwords and much more</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\nCPUs and Processors</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2033369/amds-inception-bug-looks-serious-for-photo-editors-on-ryzen-pcs.html", "date_published": "2023-08-16T18:04:08+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "LTX interview: Jumping into the custom keyboard craze", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>The mechanical keyboard craze has never been hotter.

And what he had to share might be surprising. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading the reviews and scanning the subreddits might give you the impression that it takes <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1916318/razer-blackwidow-v4-pro-keyboard-review.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">hundreds and hundreds of dollars</a> to make a &ldquo;good&rdquo; mechanical keyboard. And it&rsquo;s true, you <em>can </em>drop a car payment&rsquo;s worth of dough into a keyboard, and make it amazing. But you can get results almost as good with a budget keyboard and a few frugal upgrades, as Hipyo explains. It&rsquo;s a lot like building a gaming desktop: you can put in a ton of time and money, or just go with what works with a fraction of that. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you like the &ldquo;clicky&rdquo; feedback of Cherry&rsquo;s Blue switches, Hipyo recommends Kailh&rsquo;s popular Box Jade alternative. They&rsquo;s smoother, cleaner, and even louder, and easy to find on shops like Amazon. If you have a hot-swap keyboard, which doesn&rsquo;t require any soldering, then you don&rsquo;t need anything except a switch puller to swap them out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more interviews live from the LTX floor, and the latest info on trends in the laptop and desktop worlds, be sure to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/@pcworld&amp;xcust=2-1-2027813-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">subscribe to PCWorld on YouTube</a>. </p>\n\nKeyboards</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2027813/ltx-jumping-into-the-custom-keyboard-craze.html", "date_published": "2023-08-16T18:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Best 4K monitors 2023: HDR, 144Hz, budget, and best overall", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>4K resolution is going mainstream&mdash;even among PC monitors.

It has a new IPS Black panel that offers roughly twice the contrast of computer monitors with older IPS panels. This provides a richer image with a better sense of depth and darker black levels in dark scenes. The U3223QE also has a high maximum brightness and excellent color performance with high color accuracy. Images are vibrant and true to life.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Yet there&rsquo;s more to the Dell U3223QE than image quality. It&rsquo;s also <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/612470/you-should-buy-a-usb-c-hub-monitor-heres-what-you-need-to-know.html\">a versatile USB-C hub monitor</a> with up to 90 watts of Power Delivery. The built-in hub has multiple USB-A ports, Ethernet, and even DisplayPort out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This is a 32-inch 4K monitor, which may be too large for some desks.

The Asus ProArt PA279CV is an excellent choice.</p>\n\n<p>The ProArt PA279CV is a 27-inch 4K monitor that targets entry-level professional use. It has excellent color accuracy, high maximum brightness, and a good contrast ratio for an IPS monitor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This monitor also throws in USB-C connectivity. It&rsquo;s not a great USB-C hub, as it has only a couple USB-A ports, but it offers 65 watts of Power Delivery for charging a connected laptop or tablet.</p>\n\n<p>Asus throws in adaptive sync support compatible with AMD and Nvidia video cards. This prevents screen tearing and provides smooth motion in 3D games. The monitor has a maximum refresh rate of 60Hz.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The ProArt PA279CV carries an MSRP of about $500, but that price can swing significantly lower when retailers run a sale.

But in the end, it&rsquo;s all about getting a budget friendly 4K display and in that aspect this monitor delivers exceptional value.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/803583/asus-tuf-gaming-vg289q-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAsus TUF Gaming VG289Q review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ad page-ad has-ad-prefix ad-article\"></div>\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-separator\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart-item product-chart-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper--title product-chart-title \" id=\"samsung-m8-smart-monitor-best-4k-monitor-for-entertainment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSamsung M8 Smart Monitor &ndash; Best 4K monitor for entertainment\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"large-pro-cons-product-chart-section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproduct-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper--large\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Samsung M8 Smart Monitor - Best 4K monitor for entertainment\" class=\"product-chart-item__image\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/samsung-smart-monitor-m8-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1500\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-columns\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tHas Samsung&rsquo;s Tizen OS with smart TV features\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tRemote, webcam, and speakers included\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tExcellent SDR image quality\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tHDR quality is good for the price\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tLimited connectivity\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tAnnoying to set up and access some features\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tNo adaptive sync or enhanced refresh rate\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tNarrow viewing angle\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__information \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-label\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"not-amp\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/monitors/smart-monitors/32-m8-4k-smart-monitor-and-streaming-tv-blue-ls32bm80bunxgo/&amp;xcust=2-2-813361-6-785888-11290&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$699.99 at  Samsung</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>A 32-inch 4K monitor is great for everyday PC tasks like web browsing and document editing, but it can be more than that.

A connected PC or other external device can be used by flipping the input source, as you would on a television.

HDMI 2.1 is missing, but Xbox Series X|S consoles can achieve 4K 120Hz over HDMI 2.0 through a chroma subsampling mode.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The only problem? You can expect to pay up to $3,000 for this monitor. Viewsonic&rsquo;s XG321UG is a less expensive alternative that performs similarly, though it lacks 4K 120Hz support on Xbox Series X|S.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/810180/asus-rog-swift-pg32uqx-monitor-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAsus ROG Swift PG32UQX review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ad page-ad has-ad-prefix ad-article\"></div>\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-separator\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart-item product-chart-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper--title product-chart-title \" id=\"asus-proart-display-oled-pa32dc-best-4k-monitor-for-professionals\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAsus ProArt Display OLED PA32DC &ndash; Best 4K monitor for professionals\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"large-pro-cons-product-chart-section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproduct-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper--large\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Asus ProArt Display OLED PA32DC - Best 4K monitor for professionals\" class=\"product-chart-item__image\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/asus-proart-pa32dc-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1500\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-columns\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tThe best SDR image quality yet\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tGood HDR performance\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tLong list of image quality features\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tExceptionally sturdy\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tNumerous inputs, plus USB hub\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tHDR brightness could be better&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tGlare can be an issue in bright rooms\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tOnly 60Hz, no adaptive sync\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__information \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-label\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"not-amp\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://shop.asus.com/us/90lm06n0-b01ib0-proart-display-oled-pa32dc.html&amp;xcust=2-2-813361-6-1072579-11291&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$3499 at  Asus</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>Most professional monitors support 4K resolution, but the Asus ProArt Display OLED PA32DC stands above the pack.</p>\n\n<p>The secret is in the OLED panel. OLED looks fantastic, of course, with excellent contrast, a wide color gamut, and superb color accuracy. What sets the PA32DC apart from less expensive OLED monitors, though, is its use of a conventional RGB subpixel layout. This delivers the best clarity on modern PCs and prevents the color fringing issues that can appear on competitors that use QD-OLED display panels.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Asus provides a long list of image quality presets and options. The monitor has built-in modes for sRGB, DCI-P3, Rec. 709, and AdobeRGB, among others. It also includes multiple, accurate color temperature and gamma modes. A built-in colorimeter can be used to precisely calibrate color accuracy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The monitor is built for use in a variety of professional settings. It&rsquo;s a rugged, beefy display with thick bezels and a built-in carrying handle to help with transportation. A standard VESA desk stand is available for use in an office or at home, and the monitor has built-in legs for easy setup at a mobile studio or jobsite.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Priced at $3,000, the PA32DC may seem expensive, but it undercuts competitors like the LG UltraFine 32EP950, Apple Pro Display XDR, and Asus&rsquo; older ProArt OLED displays. This is a top-notch professional monitor suited to a wide range of content creation, and those who need excellent color performance will find that it&rsquo;s well worth the price.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1072564/asus-proart-oled-pa32dc-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAsus ProArt OLED PA32DC review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ad page-ad has-ad-prefix ad-article\"></div>\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-to-look-for-in-a-4k-monitor\">What to look for in a 4K monitor</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>4K monitors are more expensive than other monitors, so they pack numerous features and a quality display panel. A typical 4K monitor will have features that are optional on a 1080p monitor. Still, there are a few details you should know before buying a 4K monitor.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"usb-c\">USB-C</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>USB-C is an excellent choice for connecting a 4K monitor to a modern laptop with USB-C or Thunderbolt. USB-C can bundle Power Delivery and DisplayPort Alternate Mode, which means the monitor can charge a connected device while it outputs video to the monitor. Some monitors, like the Dell U3223QE, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/612470/you-should-buy-a-usb-c-hub-monitor-heres-what-you-need-to-know.html\">are USB-C hubs </a>that expand connectivity for the connected device.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"refresh-rate\">Refresh rate </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most 4K monitors have a 60Hz refresh rate. Those that go beyond 60Hz may only support an enhanced refresh rate over a specific port, so be sure to check the specifications. A monitor will need to support HDMI 2.1 or DisplayPort 1.4 to handle 4K at up to 144Hz.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"hdr\">HDR </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many 4K monitors support HDR, but most offer lackluster HDR performance. HDR will function, and may look better than SDR, but won&rsquo;t approach the quality of a good HDTV. If you want quality HDR, look for a minimum of VESA DisplayHDR 1000 certification (or VESA DisplayHDR True Black).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-we-test-4k-monitors\">How we test 4K monitors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We test 4K monitors with a DataColor SpyderXElite color calibration tool. It provides objective measurements for contrast, brightness, black levels, color gamut, color accuracy, and gamma, among other metrics. These objective results can be compared with other monitors to see how each performs against the competition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These objective image results are supplemented with our subjective evaluation of a monitor. We evaluate out-of-box image quality, sampling all types of content from gaming to movies. We look at the feature set. We closely consider details like a monitor&rsquo;s on-screen menu, ergonomic stand (or lack thereof), and overall build quality.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-block faq-block\"><h2 class=\"faq-block-title\" id=\"faq\"> FAQ </h2><hr class=\"block-horizotal-divider\" />\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">1.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"does-a-4k-monitor-need-hdmi-2-1\">Does a 4K monitor need HDMI 2.1?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>HDMI 2.1 is only important if you want to connect a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X game console at 4K resolution and play titles with 120Hz support. These consoles only support HDMI output, so an HDMI connection is your only option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most desktop PCs and laptops also have a DisplayPort output. This is preferable to HDMI 2.1 because it supports higher resolutions and refresh rates, so HDMI 2.1 is not necessary to connect a PC.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">2.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"can-my-pc-handle-a-4k-monitor\">Can my PC handle a 4K monitor?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>Support for 4K video output went mainstream around 2015. If you have a computer newer than 2015, odds are high that it supports 4K. Most PCs sold prior to 2015 will not support 4K.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to be sure? <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/541526/how-to-check-what-graphics-card-you-have.html\">Our guide to checking what graphics card you have</a> will help identify your PC&rsquo;s graphics hardware. You can then reference its official specifications to find its maximum supported resolution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gamers be warned: 4K resolution is demanding in 3D games, so you may struggle to see smooth gameplay unless you have the latest graphics hardware. You&rsquo;ll need at least an <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/393649/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-founders-edition-review-vs-2080-ti.html\">Nvidia RTX 3070</a> or <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/393729/amd-radeon-rx-6800-rx-6800-xt-review.html\">AMD Radeon RX 6800</a> to play the latest titles at 4K and 60 frames per second.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">3.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"is-text-too-small-on-a-4k-monitor\">Is text too small on a 4K monitor?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>Early adopters of 4K monitors often struggled to read small text. That&rsquo;s because many older applications were programmed such that interface elements have a defined, concrete size in pixels. The higher a display&rsquo;s resolution, the smaller the interface appears.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, this problem is mostly solved. Windows and MacOS have excellent text scaling options and most software developers have updated their applications to properly support 4K displays. It&rsquo;s still a problem with very old apps that were never updated but, in general, it&rsquo;s rare to see tiny, unreadable text on a 4K monitor.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n\nMonitors</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/813361/best-4k-monitors.html", "date_published": "2023-08-16T16:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Corsair debuts water blocks and reservoir with iCue Link support", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>The War on Cables rages on.

But it&rsquo;s still hard to find a touchscreen stand-alone monitor, unless you count all-in-one desktop designs. The latest offering from Dell&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/630195/630195.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">well-regarded P series</a> takes a leap into this wide-open space, offering the popular, laptop-friendly USB-C hub and a touchscreen all in one package.

Not for Android users &ndash; and for those who mostly use the computer, there are better options with more stable sync and file history.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Apple, like several competitors, has its own cloud storage service. It is obviously aimed at users of the company&rsquo;s hardware such as iPhones and Macs, but Apple has also developed a Windows client that provides basic support for keeping files and folders synchronized. However, there is no version for Android, so if you have an Android mobile phone and not an iPhone, you should stay away from iCloud Drive and the iCloud+ subscription. It is also not possible to log into the account with third-party software and access your cloud storage that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On iOS and Mac OS, iCloud Drive has many more features than are available on Windows, where it functions more or less as a pure cloud storage service similar to Dropbox. For example, you can back up iPhones and iPads automatically and without having to fill in the password that you have to if you back up to a Windows computer. Apps and programs can store files and manage version history with iCloud Drive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another feature is syncing photos and videos, and the larger subscriptions include Homekit Secure Video. It stores recorded video from surveillance cameras with full-spectrum encryption whose size doesn&rsquo;t count towards the Icloud space.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Icloud Drive\" class=\"wp-image-1816154\" height=\"1049\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/insta%CC%88llningar-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>iCloud Drive is alone among the major cloud storage services in not offering file history and the ability to restore older versions of files. There is a file history feature, but it must be built into the program or app that uses iCloud for storage.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-interface-could-be-better\">The interface could be better</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve installed and set up which data to sync (leave iCloud Drive ticked or you&rsquo;ll only get other iCloud features), iCloud for Windows runs as a background process and you can access settings via its icon in the notification center. For iCloud Drive, the only setting is where on the hard drive it should be located &mdash; if you subscribe to a lot of iCloud space and want to keep everything in sync, you can place the folder on <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/406861/best-external-drives.html\">an external drive</a> so it doesn&rsquo;t fill the internal one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On both Windows and Mac, one annoyance with iCloud Drive is that there is no centralized setting of which files and folders should be kept in sync and which should only be in the cloud. In Windows Explorer, you can see whether a file or folder is available offline or only in the cloud via a small icon in the status column (blue cloud symbol means it is in the cloud, green tick means it is also on the computer).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right-click on the item and you will see the options <strong><em>Always keep on this drive</em></strong> and <strong><em>Free up space</em></strong> which download and remove local storage of the file or folder, respectively. If you set a folder to be available offline, new files you add to the folder on another drive will also be automatically downloaded to your computer. You can also choose these options for the entire iCloud Drive folder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple&rsquo;s prices are relatively good, and the 200 gigabyte subscription for $2.99 per month, which includes family sharing and HomeKit Secure Video, is particularly good value. For a family with multiple iPhone users, it may be enough to keep everyone&rsquo;s phones backed up and still have some space left for file syncing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"facts\">Facts:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tested:</strong> 2023<br /><strong>Manufacturer: </strong>Apple<br /><strong>Platforms </strong>: Windows, Mac, IOS<br /><strong>Free account space</strong>: 5 GB<br /><strong>Storage space </strong>: 5 GB, 50 GB, 200 GB, 2 TB<br /><strong>Monthly price</strong>: Free, $0.99, $2.99, $9.99<br /><strong>Synchronization of optional files and folders:</strong> Yes (indirectly)<br /><strong>Family sharing: </strong>Up to six users<br /><strong>Backup feature:</strong> IOS only<br /><strong>File history</strong>: No (except some apps on IOS and Mac)<br /><strong>Other features:</strong> Email account with own domain name, HomeKit Secure Video</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This review originally appeared on pcforallse and was translated from Swedish to English.</em></p>\n\niOS, Mac, Storage, Windows</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2020879/icloud-drive-cloud-storage-for-apple-users.html", "date_published": "2023-08-16T14:30:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Alienware\u2019s OLED ultrawide, the best gaming monitor, gets a rare $200 discount", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve been waiting for a deal on a high-end OLED gaming monitor, and missed this awesome deal the first time it appeared around Amazon&rsquo;s Prime Day, you&rsquo;re in luck: It&rsquo;s back. The Alienware AW3423DWF, one of the first OLED ultrawides on the market and the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/813301/best-gaming-monitors.html\">singular best gaming display you can buy today</a>, has a deep discount right on Dell&rsquo;s site.

Notably, it&rsquo;s cheaper (and wider) than the wave of 27-inch, 240Hz OLEDs hitting the streets these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AW3423DWF is also the cheaper of Alienware&rsquo;s 34-inch OLED monitors, though &ldquo;cheaper&rdquo; is a relative term in this case. The 3440&times;1440, 0.1-millisecond curved panel is ever so slightly slower at 165Hz versus the 175Hz of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/624305/alienware-aw3423dw-review-quantum-dot-oled-makes-rival-monitors-feel-obsolete.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Alienware AW3423DW</a> (note the missing F), and it&rsquo;s rated for AMD&rsquo;s FreeSync Premium Pro instead of Nvidia&rsquo;s GSYNC, which requires extra hardware. Other than that and some black plastic, the two screens are identical, complete with double DisplayPort 1.4, HDMI 2.0, four USB ports, a headphone jack, and a little RGB lighting in the rear for the bling factor. For a full breakdown of this monitor (and the differences between it and the $1300 original model), <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1440675/alienware-aw3423dwf-review.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">check out PCWorld&rsquo;s review</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike some other early OLED monitor deals, this is a new model, not refurbished. It comes with a 3-year warranty that covers OLED burn-in for the whole period (a particular point of concern for some of these early gaming designs).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply put, this monitor is among the best of the best, and today, you can get it at a rare, steep discount. Don&rsquo;t miss out if you&rsquo;ve been considering making the luxurious leap to OLED gaming. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"cta wp-block wp-block-button\"><a class=\"cta__btn\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/alienware-34-curved-qd-oled-gaming-monitor-aw3423dwf/apd/210-bfrp/monitors-monitor-accessories&amp;xcust=2-1-1984208-7-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Get the Alienware 34-inch OLED Ultrawide Monitor for $899.99 at Dell</a></p>\nMonitors</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1984208/alienware-aw3423dwf-oled-ultrawide-best-gaming-monitor-200-off.html", "date_published": "2023-08-16T13:47:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "How to turn an old laptop into a Chromebook", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Chromebooks aren&rsquo;t for everyone, but for some folks, they&rsquo;re a perfect fit. Running Windows isn&rsquo;t always the right call&mdash;its complexity often makes life harder for users easily confused by computers (and the people who provide them IT support). A Chromebook&rsquo;s simpler interface doesn&rsquo;t require driver management or endless system updates, and malware is a much, much smaller concern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More importantly, Chromebooks run a lightweight operating system that feels fast and responsive on older and budget hardware, making them far more affordable. In fact, you can create your own Chromebook for <em>free</em> if you have an older laptop lying around. You just have to install a variant of ChromeOS on it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The process takes less than an hour, and the end result often feels snappier than today&rsquo;s dirt-cheap Chromebooks.

There can also be some security differences related to verified boot and encryption strength, since ChromeOS Flex can be installed on a wider array of devices. So if either of these is integral to your needs (and you can&rsquo;t manually tweak your old laptop to get its security to a level you like), you&rsquo;ll have to buy an official Chromebook.

You&rsquo;ll do this by hitting a key on your keyboard when your PC first powers up, similar to entering the BIOS. Search online for how to access the boot priority menu for your particular laptop, since it&rsquo;s not universal. For example, the Lenovo ThinkPad X240 required mashing F12 right at startup, while for a HP Spectre x360, it was F9. Google even provides a list of <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11552352?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=11551271#zippy=%2Cboot-keys&amp;xcust=2-2-393375-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">boot keys for major laptop makers</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An alternative method is to enter your laptop&rsquo;s BIOS (again, you will need to search for which key to press when powering on your laptop) and rearrange the automatic boot order, then undo that change after your ChromeOS Flex install.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In either case, you should be able to choose the USB drive as your boot device. A black screen with the ChromeOS logo will appear shortly thereafter.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Did you end up in your laptop&rsquo;s default operating system after booting, despite repeated button mashing?

This 12.5-inch touchscreen laptop is long in the tooth by today&rsquo;s standards, mostly due to a spinning-platter hard disk drive&mdash;when working within Windows 8.1, the system felt sluggish even during basic use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the X240&rsquo;s Intel Core i5-4300U processor, 8GB RAM, and 500GB hard drive still crushes today&rsquo;s budget Chromebooks. It hangs pretty well with <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/608636/best-chromebooks.html\">mid-range models</a> too, despite its 1366&times;768 resolution display. When I tried ChromeOS Flex off the flash drive, the touchscreen worked immediately and the system ran buttery smooth; even when installed on the hard disk drive, ChromeOS Flex had a much faster response time than Windows 8.1. In older laptops, I usually <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407542/best-ssds.html\">swap in an SSD</a> immediately, but I found I could use ChromeOS Flex on the X240&rsquo;s existing hardware without yearning for that upgrade. (But with how <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407542/best-ssds.html\">affordable SSDs are right now</a>, I&rsquo;m upgrading the HDD to an SSD anyway, because why not when a good 500GB SSD is $30 on sale?)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Standby battery life also improved, allowing me to go from a day of use between charges in Win 8.1 to a couple of days in ChromeOS Flex.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"if-you-dont-have-an-old-laptop\">If you don&rsquo;t have an old laptop</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Try hunting for gently used notebooks among reliable friends or family.

In both cases, the medium responsible for heat exchange<strong> </strong>is the ambient air. However, the way in which the heat is transported away from<strong> </strong>the CPU differs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the case of an air cooler, a metal plate&mdash;usually made of copper&mdash;lies directly on the CPU, which absorbs the waste heat and dissipates it via so-called heat pipes. The heat pipes are surrounded by cooling fins, which are usually made of aluminum. The more heat pipes and the more cooling surface (number and area of the cooling fins) available to the heatsink, the more waste heat it can absorb and dissipate. Heat is exchanged with the ambient air through the heatsink. There is a distinction between a passive cooler and an active cooler, which accelerates the heat exchange through one or more mounted fans and the resulting air flow. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Funktionsweise einer All-in-One-Wasserk&uuml;hlung\" class=\"wp-image-1523119\" height=\"572\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Funktionsweise-einer-AiO-Wasserkuhlung.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">How an all-in-one water-cooling system works</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Gamers Nexus</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In a water-cooling<strong> </strong>system, a heatsink sits on top of the processor, the bottom plate of which is usually also made of copper. On the top are many small fins around which the cooling liquid flows to absorb the heat. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A pump ensures that the warm liquid is transported to the radiator. Similar to the air cooler, this is made up of many small cooling fins, usually made of aluminum, between which the &ldquo;water&rdquo; flows through small tubes. As a result, the entire radiator heats up and releases the waste heat into the ambient air. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fans mounted on the radiator ensure a better heat exchange. So the name water cooling is ultimately somewhat misleading, because the &ldquo;water&rdquo; is only the means of transport, the cooling takes place via the ambient air in both cooling variants.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><strong>Further reading: </strong><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394965/how-to-set-up-your-pcs-fans-for-maximum-system-cooling.html\">How to set up your PC fans for maximum system cooling</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading toc\" id=\"advantages-and-disadvantages-of-an-all-in-one-water-cooling-system\">Advantages and disadvantages of an all-in-one water-cooling system</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;A water cooler cools better than an air cooler&rdquo; is a general statement, but when is that really the case&mdash;and why is that so? The effectiveness of the cooling depends on two points: firstly, how quickly, and secondly, how much waste heat can be dissipated into the ambient air and out of the case. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>An air cooler sits directly on the processor and thus usually centrally in the enclosure. This means that the waste heat from the CPU goes directly into the interior of the PC and must be transported out of the case from there by additional fans. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With water cooling, you have the option of installing the radiator under the lid of the case and letting the fans blow the waste heat directly out of the case. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"TeamGroup AIO SSD cooler\" class=\"wp-image-1360293\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/aio-ssd-cooler.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">TeamGroup</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Another point is the space available. An air cooler is limited in every dimension. In height by the side panel of the PC case and in width and depth by the heatsink of the motherboard, the RAM, and installed PCIe plug-in cards. The volume of the cooler is accordingly limited. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The radiator of a water cooling system, on the other hand, can be placed in the front, in the rear, or under the lid of a case and is thus much more variable in its size. To put a figure on it, 120 x 120 mm<sup>2</sup> of radiator surface can dissipate 100 watts of waste heat. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>High-end CPU coolers such as the <a href=\"http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=14154&amp;GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/quiet-BK007-Elegant-Surface-Technology/dp/B087VL2Z21?ascsubtag=2-1-2030992-1-0-0\" rel=\"nofollow\">be quiet! Dark Rock Pro 4</a> are specified by the manufacturer with a TDP of 250 watts. Experience shows that the cooling performance of such an air cooler is roughly on the level of a compact water-cooling system with a 240mm radiator. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you need at least a 280mm or 360mm radiator to achieve better results than with good air cooling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to installation, it is debatable whether an air cooler or a water cooler is advantageous. With an air cooler, significantly fewer screws are necessary, but depending on the model, they are difficult to access and a large air cooler can cover the RAM slots. This means that the CPU cooler may also have to be removed when upgrading the RAM. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Thermaltake toughliquid AIO turquoise \" class=\"wp-image-1937535\" height=\"614\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/thermaltake-toughliquid-240-argb-sync-turquoise.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1024\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Thermaltake</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>An AiO water-cooling system leaves much more free space around the socket, but you have to mount the fans separately on the radiator and fix it in the case. Regarding the noise level, it is as already listed above: </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A larger surface area of the heatsink ensures better heat dissipation, which means that the fans can rotate more slowly for the same cooling performance. However, with water cooling there is an additional source of noise in the form of the pump&mdash;although this works very quietly in modern water-cooling systems. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, an all-in-one water cooling system still has two clear disadvantages compared to an air cooler. The first is the price of many models. In the price comparison, compact water coolers with a 240mm radiator can be found in the price range from $65 to $275. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Air coolers, on the other hand, stop at around $110. The second disadvantage is the shorter service life and higher probability of failure. While with an air cooler only the fans&mdash;especially their bearings&mdash;can break down, with a compact water cooler the pump, the seals, and the control electronics are also affected. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><thead><tr><th>Advantages (AiO vs air cooler)</th><th>Disadvantages (AiO vs air cooler)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Better cooling performance due to more surface area (from 280mm radiator)</strong></td><td><strong>Mostly expensive</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Variable placement of the radiator (beware of hose length!)</strong></td><td><strong>Pump is always running (noise generation)</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Can transport warm air directly out of the case</strong></td><td><strong>Higher probability of failure</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>More free space around the base </strong></td><td><strong>Lower life expectancy</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Optics (matter of taste)</strong></td><td><strong>Poorer cooling of the motherboard&rsquo;s voltage converters</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading toc\" id=\"choosing-and-installing-an-aio-what-you-need-to-consider\">Choosing and installing an AiO: What you need to consider</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Compatibility with the case</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you decide on a compact water-cooling system, you first have to make sure that it will fit into the enclosure. Fortunately, most enclosure manufacturers specify where and how large radiators can be installed in the enclosure. However, this specification usually only refers to the length and width of the radiator, but there is also the thickness to consider. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most radiators of an all-in-one water-cooling system are 27mm thick, in combination with the 25mm of the fans, this results in a total thickness of 52mm. In a few models, however, the radiator is 30mm or even 38mm thick. With these variants, depending on the case, it is not possible to mount the radiator on top, as it collides with the cooler of the motherboard. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Fractal Design listet beim North genau die Radiatorkompatibilit&auml;t auf \" class=\"wp-image-1524325\" height=\"662\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Fractal-Design-North-Radiatorkompatibilitat.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Fractal Design</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Compatibility with the motherboard</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second point should be self-evident, that you have to make sure that the compact water cooling is compatible with the socket of your motherboard when choosing the AiO water cooling. You may have to reorder a (usually) free mounting kit for a new socket from the manufacturer of the water-cooling system if this is not already included in the scope of delivery. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><strong>Further reading: </strong><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1520957/best-gaming-motherboards-picks-for-intel-and-amd.html\">The best gaming motherboards</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Pay attention to the warranty</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As already described above in the disadvantages, there is a higher probability of failure with an all-in-one water-cooling system than with an air cooler. That&rsquo;s why it makes sense to spend a few more dollars and buy a model with a five-year warranty instead of the standard two years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. The pump must always be in the water</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For manufacturing reasons, there is always some air left in the circuit of a compact water cooler. The level also decreases over time due to diffusion. The air always rises to the highest point of the water circuit. If the pump draws in air, this can lead not only to disturbing noises but also, in extreme cases, to bearing damage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this reason, you should ensure during installation that the pump is not at the highest point in the circuit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ideally, the radiator should be installed at the top of the case or in the front, provided the hose connections are at the bottom. You can get a very clear explanation of this topic in the following YouTube video from Gamers Nexus.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Hose length</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another point you should consider when choosing an AiO water cooling system is the length of the tubing. This is directly related to point 3, because not all enclosures allow you to mount the radiator on top. In this case, you should ensure that the hoses are long enough so that you can install the radiator in the front of the enclosure with the hose connections at the bottom. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Fill port and quick release</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most compact water cooling systems are a pre-filled, closed system. This means that apart from cleaning the radiator and the fans, you cannot carry out any maintenance on the pump or the fill level. If the product no longer functions as desired, the only option is to return it to the manufacturer or buy a new one. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there are also AiO water-cooling systems with a built-in fill port to be able to exchange or refill coolant. Another interesting feature is open systems with quick-release fasteners, such as the Eisbaer cooling solutions from Alphacool.  This makes it possible to integrate additional radiators or other cooling blocks into the cooling circuit, for example for the graphics card.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7. Orientation of the fans: Push vs. pull vs. push &amp; pull</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does it make a difference in which orientation the fans are installed? Yes, it does, but the difference is not great. At low fan speeds, a push orientation (fans blowing air through the radiator) provides slightly better temperatures&mdash;about 2 degrees&mdash;and generates less noise. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A pull configuration (fans pull the air through the radiator), however, is not a leg-beater and even provides better temperatures at high fan speeds. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a push-and-pull configuration (fans on both sides of the radiator), you can either turn the fans slower for the same performance or the temperatures will be slightly better at the same speed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from aesthetic reasons, a double fan configuration is only really worthwhile for a custom water-cooling system with a radiator thickness of 45 millimeters or more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>8. RGB lighting and display</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A trend has not stopped at compact water-cooling systems: RGB lighting. But not only the fans can shine in all kinds of colors, depending on the model, but also the pump attachment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the more expensive models even have a display that shows real-time data about your PC, such as the current CPU temperature. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><strong>Further reading: </strong><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394965/how-to-set-up-your-pcs-fans-for-maximum-system-cooling.html\">How to set up your PC fans for maximum system cooling</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article was translated from German to English and originally appeared on pcwelt.de.</em></p>\n\nComputer Components</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2030992/all-in-one-water-cpu-coolers-advantages-disadvantages-tips.html", "date_published": "2023-08-16T10:45:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Acer Swift X 14 review: Portable, muscular, and OLED charm", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n<div class=\"review\" id=\"review-body\"><span class=\"review-title\">At a glance</span><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"experts-rating\">Expert's Rating</h3><div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n<div><div class=\"review-columns\"><div class=\"review-column\"><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"pros\">Pros</h3><ul class=\"pros review-list\"><li>Excellent CPU performance</li><li>Pleasant keyboard and touchpad</li><li>Beautiful OLED display</li><li>Good range USB-C and USB-A connectivity</li></ul></div><div class=\"review-column\"><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"cons\">Cons</h3><ul class=\"cons review-list\"><li>Generic design</li><li>Extremely disappointing battery life</li><li>RTX 4050 held back by 50-watt TGP</li></ul></div></div></div><h3 class=\"review-subTitle review-subTitle--borderTop\" id=\"our-verdict\">Our Verdict</h3><p class=\"verdict\">The Acer Swift X 14 delivers extremely strong CPU performance, respectable GPU performance, and a beautiful OLED display in a slim profile.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Acer&rsquo;s Swift X lineup, which promises big laptop performance in a more compact 14-inch footprint, is now several years old.

It&rsquo;s more expensive than the Lenovo Slim Pro 7, which starts at $1,199, but delivers quicker hardware. Gigabyte&rsquo;s Aero 14 OLED, another comparable laptop PC World has yet to test, retails for $1,599.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"acer-swift-x-14-design-and-build-quality\">Acer Swift X 14: Design and build quality</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Acer Swift X design\" class=\"wp-image-2026121\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/acer-swift-x-14-2023-5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Acer Swift X 14 doesn&rsquo;t stand out at a glance, though that&rsquo;s not to say it&rsquo;s unattractive. It has a simple gunmetal exterior with a touch of sparkle to its finish, but the laptop&rsquo;s boxy, generic profile is unremarkable. Don&rsquo;t buy this laptop if you want your friends to notice your new rig.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A combo of plastic and material lines the Swift X 14&rsquo;s exterior and, once again, proves adequate but unexceptional. The laptop&rsquo;s lower half feels rock-solid when handled and the display allows minimal flex while it&rsquo;s opened or closed, but the materials used don&rsquo;t have the thick, sturdy feel found with Apple&rsquo;s MacBook Pro or <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1797659/lenovo-slim-pro-7-review.html\">Lenovo Slim Pro 7</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the Swift X 14 is rather compact for a laptop with its specifications. It&rsquo;s just 12.9 inches wide and .7 inches thick, which makes it roughly similar in size to a MacBook Pro 14 or Lenovo Slim Pro 7, and it&rsquo;s lighter than both at just 3.31 pounds. That&rsquo;s good news if you want a laptop with powerful hardware that remains easy to throw in a bag for a quick trip across town.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"acer-swift-x-14-keyboard-trackpad\">Acer Swift X 14: Keyboard, trackpad</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Acer Swift X keyboard\" class=\"wp-image-2026125\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/acer-swift-x-14-2023-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><p>binary comment</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Acer provides a spacious, comfortable keyboard for the Swift X 14. It has a conventional layout with space to provide large keys across most of the keyboard, though the left-side Ctrl and Alt keys are perhaps a tad small. The keyboard is center-aligned and positioned well back in the laptop, which offers ample space for your palms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key feel is solid, too, with long key travel and a crisp bottoming action. There is room to further improve key feel, as the rebound action feels a bit vague to my fingers, but this is a nitpick. The keyboard feels great while touch-typing and proved comfortable. The Swift X 14 faces tough competition from alternatives like the Lenovo Slim Pro 7 and MacBook Air 13/15, which also have excellent keyboards (and I do slightly prefer these alternatives), but Acer keeps itself in the running.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can also happily report that Acer&rsquo;s new Swift X 14 fixes a personal pet peeve I&rsquo;ve remarked on with some recent Acer laptops: the keyboard is black, rather than silver or gray. The contrast of a black key finish against a silver or gunmetal chassis provides a premium look, so I&rsquo;m happy to see Acer make this change.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The spacious touchpad is another strength. It measures roughly five and a half inches wide by three inches deep, providing plenty of space for Windows&rsquo; multi-touch gestures. Acer also serves up a comfortable, luxurious, and responsive glass finish that feels wonderful to use. As true of the keyboard, the Swift X 14 doesn&rsquo;t defeat its toughest competitors, but it&rsquo;s a great experience for the price.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"acer-swift-x-14-display-audio\">Acer Swift X 14: Display, audio</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Acer Swift X\" class=\"wp-image-2026102\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/acer-swift-x-14-2023-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><p>binary comment</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Every Acer Swift X 14 with Nvidia RTX 4050 graphics has a 14.5-inch, 2,880 x 1,800 OLED display with a maximum refresh rate of 120Hz. It&rsquo;s an excellent display that looks great no matter the content you throw at it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrast is a traditional strength of OLED panels, the Acer Swift X 14&rsquo;s display is no different. It provides an effectively infinite contrast ratio and achieves a minimum luminance of zero nits in dark content. It provides excellent detail in dark, shadowy scenes, and a superb sense of depth to brighter, more dynamic content. This makes it great for movies, streaming shows, and games. This is a strength of the Acer Swift X 14 over the base <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1355530/dell-xps-13-9315-review.html\">Dell XPS 13</a>, Lenovo Slim Pro 7, and Acer MacBook Air 13/15, all of which have less contrast-rich IPS LCD displays.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Color performance is excellent, too, as the display&rsquo;s color gamut spans 100 percent of DCI-P3 and 94 percent AdobeRGB. These results are typical for an OLED panel in a modern laptop, but still great, and generally better than the best LCD IPS laptop displays. Colorful content looks vibrant, and the display&rsquo;s color accuracy is suitable for photo and video editing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brightness is a weak point, though, as the display reaches a peak brightness of 365 nits and has a glossy display coat. The display is usable even in a brightly lit room, or near a sunlit window, but glare can prove distracting if a light source is directly behind you. HDR can increase this to 522 nits which, although not as high as the 700 nits available from a Mini-LED laptop like the Razer Blade 16, is substantial and delivers punch in HDR content.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The display&rsquo;s maximum resolution of 120Hz, as well as OLED&rsquo;s low pixel response times, makes for great motion clarity in games. Fast-moving objects show good detail and quick camera pans resist becoming a smudgy mess. Small, fast-moving text or tiny, detailed objects will still seem a bit vague, but that&rsquo;s true of all displays south of 240Hz.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the display is excellent, the speakers are just ok. They provide good volume at their maximum and are placed above the keyboard, which means they won&rsquo;t sound muffled when the laptop is used on your laptop. However, they offer a narrow soundstage and can become muddied when bass creeps into a track. The speakers are broadly comparable to most 14-inch laptops available today but a step behind the Lenovo Slim Pro 7 and a leap behind the MacBook Pro 14 or <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1677692/lenovo-yoga-9i-review-2.html\">Lenovo Yoga 9i</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"acer-swift-x-14-webcam-microphone-biometrics\">Acer Swift X 14: Webcam, microphone, biometrics</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Acer packs a 1080p webcam into the Swift X 14&rsquo;s slim top bezel. It provides a strong, crisp with good color reproduction and is generally a nice upgrade over any laptop with a 720p webcam. It&rsquo;s not the best 1080p webcam I&rsquo;ve tried (once again, alternatives from Lenovo and Apple tend to be better), but it&rsquo;s great for Zoom, Google Chat, Teams, and other video conferencing apps.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A dual-microphone array is provided alongside the camera. Its performance is a bit less remarkable, as audio recordings aren&rsquo;t the strongest or clearist I&rsquo;ve heard, but it remains fine for video and audio conferencing. Your voice will be clear and most background noises will be obscured, though any that happen to be in the same room as you are likely to come through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Acer doesn&rsquo;t support biometric login on the Swift X 14. That&rsquo;s a minor knock against it, as many of the laptop&rsquo;s competitors will offer either a fingerprint reader, facial recognition login, or both.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"acer-swift-x-14-connectivity\">Acer Swift X 14: Connectivity</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Acer Swift X ports\" class=\"wp-image-2026128\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/acer-swift-x-14-2023-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Acer Swift X 14 provides an excellent mix of modern and legacy connectivity that&rsquo;s generally superior to many of its competitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A pair of two USB4 / Thunderbolt 4 ports have modern peripherals and gadgets covered. Both support DisplayPort Alternate Mode and provide enough USB Power Delivery to match the maximum provided by the laptop&rsquo;s power brick (which is 100 watts). That means both ports can be connected to an external monitor or charge the laptop.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Older peripherals are supported by two USB-A ports, one HDMI, and one 3.5mm combo headphone/microphone audio jack. There&rsquo;s also a MicroSD card reader, which is handy if you own a device (like a handheld gaming device or camera) that uses MicroSD cards.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s just one thing Acer could handle better, and that&rsquo;s the location of the ports. The Acer Swift X 14 positions its ports near the middle of the laptop, rather than towards the rear, so wired connections may look a bit awkward and take up excessive desk space.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, the Swift X 14&rsquo;s connectivity is excellent. Many competitors provide USB4 / Thunderbolt 4, but most don&rsquo;t pair that with both USB-A and HDMI, and Acer throws in MicroSD as a bonus.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"acer-swift-x-14-performance\">Acer Swift X 14: Performance&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Acer&rsquo;s Swift X 14 isn&rsquo;t a large laptop, but it packs a punch. It equips Intel&rsquo;s Core i7-13700H processor, which has a total of 14 cores (six performance cores and eight efficient cores) alongside Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX 4050 graphics. A 1TB solid state drive and 16GB of DDR5 memory come standard, as well.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Acer Swift X PCMark results\" class=\"wp-image-2026131\" height=\"733\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/acer-swift-x-14-pcmark.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>PCMark 10, a holistic system benchmark, puts the Acer Swift X 14 off to a strong start. It achieves a score of 6,805, which beats both the Lenovo Slim Pro 7 and, more surprisingly, the larger Dell XPS 15, though the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1525530/samsung-galaxy-book3-ultra-review.html\">Samsung Galaxy Book Ultra3 </a>zooms ahead with a score of 7,111.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Acer Swift X Cinebench\" class=\"wp-image-2026132\" height=\"751\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/acer-swift-x-14-cinebench-r15.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Cinebench R15 provides another strong result for the Acer Swift X 14, where it goes toe-to-toe with other Core i7-13700H laptops. While the Acer doesn&rsquo;t beat the average, it&rsquo;s worth remembering the Slim X 14 is more similar in size to the Lenovo Slim Pro 7, so its relative performance is impressive.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Acer Swift X Handbrake\" class=\"wp-image-2026133\" height=\"740\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/acer-swift-x-14-handbrake.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>And that remains true in Handbrake. While the Acer Swift X 14 slides a bit behind its Core i7-13700H brethren here, it still lands well ahead of the Lenovo Slim Pro 7. That&rsquo;s a great result. I lauded the Slim 7 Pro for its CPU performance when I tested it, as it defeats many 13-inch and 14-inch laptops, so it&rsquo;s wonderful to see the Acer Swift X 14 give it a thumping.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Acer Swift X 3DMark results\" class=\"wp-image-2026135\" height=\"752\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/acer-swift-x-14-3dmark.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Now we move on to 3D performance, where the Nvidia RTX 4050 becomes more relevant. It&rsquo;s worth mentioning that Acer&rsquo;s implementation of the RTX 4050 has a maximum graphics power of 50 watts, which is towards the low side of what&rsquo;s possible (the maximum per Nvidia&rsquo;s specifications is 115 watts).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even so, 3DMark Time Spy provides a reasonably optimistic result of 5,644. That&rsquo;s much better than older Nvidia RTX 3050 laptops, and not too far behind some laptops with Nvidia RTX 4060 or RTX 4070 graphics. However, the Samsung Galaxy Book 3 Ultra, which has an RTX 4050 with a maximum graphics power of 60 watts, pulls out a significant win.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Acer Swift X Tomb Raider Shadow\" class=\"wp-image-2026141\" height=\"809\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/acer-swift-x-14-shadow-of-the-tomb-raider.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em>, a game which represents the cutting edge of graphics in the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One era of console games, returns a playable but modest average of 73 frames per second at 1080p resolution and Highest detail settings. That&rsquo;s not bad, but it&rsquo;s a step behind laptops with more watts available to the GPU.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Acer Swift X Metro Exodus results\" class=\"wp-image-2026142\" height=\"748\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/acer-swift-x-14-metro-exodus.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I wasn&rsquo;t expecting a lot from our excessively tasking Metro Exodus benchmark. Launching the benchmark at 1080p resolution and Extreme detail results in a mere 26 frames per second, even without ray tracing enabled. That&rsquo;s not really playable, but also not too far behind other laptops with RTX 4060 and 4070 hardware. Knocking down the game to its still-beautiful High detail is much better, however, with an average of 56 frames per second.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also fired up <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, a notoriously demanding game that remains taxing for many laptops. The game averaged a respectable 53 frames per second at 1080p and Ultra detail and ray tracing off, but only achieved 15 frames per second with Ultra ray tracing turned on. However, Nvidia&rsquo;s DLSS 3 frame generation saves the day, boosting performance back up to a playable 46 FPS. That&rsquo;s not comparable to a larger gaming laptop, of course, but it&rsquo;s a good result for a 14-inch laptop.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"acer-swift-x-14-battery-life\">Acer Swift X 14: Battery life</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Acer Swift X 14&rsquo;s 76 watt-hour battery seems suited to its task, as it&rsquo;s similar in size to the battery found in Lenovo&rsquo;s Slim Pro 7, the Dell XPS 13 Plus, and the Apple MacBook Pro 14. Unfortunately, real-world results fall short.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Acer Swift X Battery life\" class=\"wp-image-2026145\" height=\"755\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/acer-swift-x-14-battery-life.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Blame the Nvidia RTX 4050 or, to be more precise, the way Acer implements it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laptops with Nvidia discrete graphics can achieve excellent battery life when Nvidia Optimus is used to disable the GPU when its performance isn&rsquo;t required. Lenovo&rsquo;s Slim 7 Pro is an example of this in action. The Acer Swift X 14 doesn&rsquo;t support Optimus, however, so it continues to drain the battery even when browsing the web or writing in Word.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The impact on battery life is rather dire. The Acer Swift X 14 doesn&rsquo;t exceed five hours of battery life in our standard battery benchmark, which loops a 4K file of the short film <em>Tears of Steel</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s the same story when browsing the web or using basic productivity apps like Word and Excel. The laptop chewed through the battery at a rate of roughly 25 percent per hour, leaving it flat in about four hours. That&rsquo;s not great.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"acer-swift-x-14-should-you-buy-it\">Acer Swift X 14: Should you buy it?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Acer&rsquo;s Swift X 14 is a solid choice for anyone looking to purchase a compact, powerful laptop at a reasonable price. It provides strong CPU and GPU performance, a spacious solid state drive, excellent OLED display, and even has a pleasant keyboard and touchpad. Battery life is the only serious problem (and, make no mistake, it is a problem). Still, the Swift X 14 could be an alluring value if your journeys take you to a local coffee shop instead of the airport.&nbsp;</p>\n\nLaptops</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2026099/acer-swift-x-14-review.html", "date_published": "2023-08-16T10:30:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Upgrade to Windows 11 Pro and get Microsoft Office for one price", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Everybody wants the best possible tools and support for their laptop.
