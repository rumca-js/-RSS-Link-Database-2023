Michael Render grew up on the west side of Atlanta; from the age of nine, he aspired to be a rapper, eventually creating the moniker Killer Mike, as he explains, “so that he could be the most badass rap MC in the world.” 

Now, 20 years into a hip-hop career that includes 10 years as part of the acclaimed group Run The Jewels, Killer Mike has released the solo album, 'Michael,' (available on @LomaVistaRecs) so that people would get to know the more personal side of Michael Render, “that little nine-year-old boy on the album cover with the horns and the halo and the buck teeth and the smile.”

Following a session in The Current studio, Killer Mike sat down with host Jill Riley to share his story. It’s deeply personal and profoundly moving.
