This week on Breakout, we discuss the current discussion surrounding developers supposedly "panicking" over Baldur's Gate 3, and everything else we've been playing or watching.

Featuring Nick Calandra, Marty Sliva, and KC Nwosu, the freeform podcast dives into a bit of our daily lives, the latest games, movies, tv shows and books, the occasional craft beer review and random topics we find interesting.
