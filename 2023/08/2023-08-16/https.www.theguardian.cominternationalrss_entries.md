<p>From Sam Kerr’s first start to a ravenous home crowd, here’s what stood out in Australia’s heartbreaking loss to the Lionesses</p><p>The will-she-won’t-she intrigue surrounding Sam Kerr’s fitness or otherwise to start a game again dominated pre-match conversations. By Tuesday afternoon, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/15/womens-world-cup-2023-matildas-australia-vs-england-will-sam-kerr-start-play-team-lineup-squad">it appeared the captain would again start on the bench</a>, after coach Tony Gustavsson teased the media with a line about his preference for continuity. It was perhaps with some surprise then to see Kerr’s name in the starting XI for the clash against England, with Emily van Egmond dropping to the bench to make way for the Chelsea striker. But it was a nice surprise nonetheless that gave Australia a huge boost at a critical juncture.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/17/six-key-moments-that-shaped-the-matildas-world-cup-semi-final-against-england">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘I’m going to die’: TV’s most dangerous reality shows, from being eaten alive by ants to developing trenchfoot

<p>From being eaten alive by ants to camping naked with hungry lions, survival TV makes for addictive television. But what kind of people are willing to risk their lives for our entertainment?</p><p>It’s nearly midnight and Kaila Cumings is curled up naked outside in the dust. She can hear noises beside her head: hot breaths, sniffing, a growl. There are two male lions circling her shelter, which is composed of just a few thin branches piled together. Earlier that day, lions killed and ate two poachers in the surrounding area of Limpopo, South Africa. Now they’d tasted human flesh, Cumings had been warned by camp rangers that they may be looking for more. So she waits, naked and afraid, which is, incidentally, the title of the Discovery+ survival show that she is appearing on: Naked and Afraid XL.</p><p>The popular franchise – in which survivalists tough it out in the wilderness, totally nude – isn’t the only TV series you’d sit and watch at home and think, this is <em>batshit</em>. Over the years, we’ve been presented with all manner of dangerous situations on screen, many of them involving extreme, punishing conditions. More recently, such shows have gained new popularity. Explosive endurance competition <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/10/outlast-review-a-brilliant-survival-show-that-ends-up-in-full-on-lord-of-the-flies-wildness">Outlast</a> arrived on Netflix in March, and has been commissioned for a second series. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jul/17/survivor-is-back-in-time-for-lockdown-my-friends-and-i-have-been-stranded-without-it">Survivor</a>, first aired in 2000, is coming back to the UK this year via the BBC.

<p>The main figures in the Oscar-winning movie are embroiled in an ugly legal dispute. But the story never sat comfortably with many observers</p><p>In late 2009 I was sent to Baltimore for <a href="https://vault.si.com/vault/2009/11/30/shhh-movies-started">a Sports Illustrated feature story on Michael Oher</a>, a rare household name among NFL offensive linemen. Oher was a few months into his rookie year and on the brink of a critical showdown against the Indianapolis Colts.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/dec/02/sportandleisure.features">In the book version of The Blind Side</a>, which places Oher within the NFL’s evolution into a passing league, he is set on a collision course with the sport’s top quarterback cruncher – Indy’s Dwight Freeney. And after devouring the Michael Lewis book, his Moneyball for football geeks, I was keen to dig into this and more with Oher. By this point he was over the book and unhappy with the much-hyped film that sprang from it and was due to premiere that same weekend. The Ravens PR team cautioned that Oher would turn me away faster than a corner blitzer if I asked too many questions about The Blind Side. Just how touchy a subject it was for him has become that much clearer in the wake of a feud that contains personal wounds, cultural rifts and career consequences that run deep.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/16/blind-side-white-savior-story-tuohy-michael-oher-conservatorship">Continue reading...</a>

<p>England are dominating their over-70s series against Australia with a bit of Bazball working wonders</p><p>A clunk, a shout, a cheer and England have beaten Australia. The celebrations are not as wild as you expect – no leaping on the keeper, no Stuart Broad laps of the outfield. Perhaps it’s because the game has long been heading to this conclusion: Australia are all out in the 43rd over, still 91 runs adrift. Perhaps it’s because the winners are taking care of their joints.</p><p>England’s over-70s team have absolutely dominated the three-match one-day international series – aka The Silver Ashes. They won the first game at Castle Park in Colchester by 54 runs, thanks in no small part to a splendid 114 not out from their captain, John Evans, who was 71 in July. He was instrumental to the cause again at Wellington, top-scoring with 57 off 84 balls. Not bad for a man who waited more than six decades to make his international debut.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/16/cricket-silver-ashes-england-over-70s-australia">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The streaming service is capable of interesting works for children, with this one based on 16th century novel Journey to the West featuring an irritating protagonist</p><p>Despite recent budget cuts, Netflix’s in-house animation division continues to produce lively, interesting works that, if released theatrically, might be diverting some of the applause that gets automatically lavished on Disney and Pixar’s currently mediocre output. Not that this is anywhere as rich and strange as the streaming service’s last big title, the Oscar-winning <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/24/pinocchio-review-disney-fairytale-guillermo-del-toro-fantasy-horror">Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio</a>. The latest in a 10,000-mile-long line of adaptations of Journey to the West, the 16th-century Chinese novel attributed to Wu Cheng’en, bounces along energetically, and has some exceptionally fun frills around the edges, such as a flouncy vocal performance from Bowen Yang as spiteful, effete baddie the Dragon King, who gets to sing the film’s best musical number. (Vowing to flood the world as revenge for being mocked for his dry skin condition that can only be treated with an amphibian lifestyle, he sings: “Since then I’ve realised there’s nothing wrong with being moisturised.” Surely this is a metrosexual anthem in the making.)</p><p>Sadly, the Dragon King only gets wheeled in sporadically, as the lead protagonist is the considerably less endearing Monkey (Jimmy O Yang). A cocksure braggart who was born from a rock and is afflicted with an acute narcissistic personality disorder, Monkey steals the Dragon King’s all-powerful multi-use Stick – whose voice sounds like a didgeridoo and is a bit like a magical Swiss army knife – which he uses on a quest to obtain immortality. Some of the adventures – peach stealing, meeting the omnipotent Buddha – will be familiar to those who remember the wonderful late-1970s Japanese live-action <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_(TV_series)">TV series Monkey</a> that the BBC used to screen. (This was the show that really popularised Journey to the West beyond Asia, while also entertaining stoners worldwide who chanced on it while channel-surfing late at night.)</p><p>The Monkey King is released on 18 August on Netflix.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/16/the-monkey-king-review-lively-netflix-animation-revives-ancient-chinese-classic">Continue reading...</a>
