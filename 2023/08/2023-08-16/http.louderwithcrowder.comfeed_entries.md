## News reports about old man arrested for inappropriately touching a little girl, "accidentally" shows Joe Biden

In an unrelated story, a 78-year-old man is set to give his State of the Union Address. And a graphics editor at a local news network is about to be unemployed after confusing the two. As the anchor was about to tell the first story, a graphic about Joe Biden's SOTU flashed on the screen in the awesomest mistake in local news history.</p><p>We'll get to why in a bit. Even though I know that you know that I know that you know. First, watch the report. Standard viral video disclaimers. I'm mostly confident this is legit, but I've been fooled in the past. The clip is from 2022, but the deity or deities of content are blessing us today by making it go viral again.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Yes, it was an accident. Or the graphic editor had already decided he was tired of this sh*t. The slip-up was his way of saying "I quit, b*tches" before putting on a DeSantis 2024 had and flipping off all the key grips. That's within the realm of possibility.

Biden has a tough time around little girls <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-kids-connecticut-school" target="_blank">when their shampoo smells like raspberries</a>.

## Watch: Police creatively take out woman firing gun in a busy intersection by sideswiping her with an SUV

There are days you find out. For one, we're assuming crazy, woman in a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/national-anthemnew-york-islanders" target="_blank">Long Island</a> suburb, it was a little from column A and a little from column B. The f*ck around came when she started firing a gun in the middle of an intersection. Then she found out as a police SUV took her out. Like, hit her with a moving vehicle, took her out.</p><p>According <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12411479/Cops-praised-using-SUV-mow-save-woman-firing-gun-air-holding-head-middle-busy-NY-intersection.html" target="_blank">Daily Mail</a>, the shots fired call came in around 2:30 in the afternoon. The owner of a nearby gas station is who we have to thank for our video of the dingbat having a meltdown. Whatever her problem was, she was firing a gun at cars and could have easily switched to anyone walking along the sidewalk. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="6cc27" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=34883709&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>Police arrived at the scene as she was pointing a gun at her head. The easiest thing would have been to let her isolate the threat herself. But she could have started firing at civilians instead. One officer was in the SUV. It had a battering ram in the front. AND DOWN SHE GOES!</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>Nassau Police Commissioner Patrick Ryder praised the quick-thinking and lead-footed police officer. The department has one rule. Deadly force gets met with deadly force. "[Officers] faced down deadly physical force against civilians and themselves, and they used the vehicle to stop that threat. The other option on the table is to take out the gun and shoot it. They didn't do that."</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

## Bradley Cooper target of social media outrage over prosthetic nose he wears in Leonard Bernstein biopic ‘Maestro’

If you focus on the words "nose" and "Bernstein," you can guess where this is going.</p><p>Netflix dropped the trailer on Tuesday. Enough people were upset about it instead of going outside to touch grass that <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/bradley-cooper-prosthetic-nose-leonard-bernstein-maestro-jewface-rcna100137" target="_blank">NBC News decided to create content about</a> the outrage.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Leonard Bernstein was Jewish. Bradley Cooper is not. Since Bernstein had a different nose than Cooper, the actor went with a prosthetic for authenticity. Seems harmless and a normal person wouldn't even notice. But enough outraged people dropped X over it that NBC News -- a recognized legitimate and trustworthy "news" source, which is what makes this news to react to -- cherry-picked a few tweets to highlight how OUTRAGED everyone is.</p><p>"Hollywood cast Bradley Cooper — a non Jew — to play Jewish legend Leonard Bernstein and stuck a disgusting exaggerated 'Jew nose' on him," cried one organization.</p><p>“Bradley Cooper is putting himself in an insanely large prosthetic nose to play a Jewish man in Maestro and we’re all just supposed to act like that’s cool and normal?” wonder another X user</p><p>"Just looked up a picture of the real Leonard Bernstein…. the big antisemitic prosthetic nose on Bradley Cooper was definitely not necessary…" proclaimed someone else. You be the judge:</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="35673" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=34882906&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Others accused the actor of performing in "Jewface." Similar to how TikTok ingénue Dylan Mulvaney performs in "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dylan-mulvaney-other-women-girlhood" target="_blank">titface</a>" even though <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dylan-mulvaney-price-right" target="_blank">he himself is not a girl</a>. </p><p>Neither Cooper nor Netflix responded in time to NBC News's inquiries if they had an opinion about a handful of randos being upset with them on a social media app. If I were the guess, both of their PR firms are rushing an apology to the media as we speak.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

<p>I'm sure families who have lost everything will take whatever money they can get right now. And I encourage anyone who can, donate to help.

<p>But the accounting team here at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website crunched the numbers and looked at the over $113,000,000,000.00 that has been sent to Ukraine. Compared to the $700 per household in Maui, it breaks down to over $2500 per PERSON in Ukraine.

Unlike other parents, there was a coordinated effort to get her fired from her job at Compass Real Estate. Note: Compass is a publically traded corporation. Janet worked at the branch in Benicia, California. </p><p>She must have had some horrible things to say, huh? So horrible that a blogger contacted her employer to say they were writing an article about comments Janet made at a school board meeting. The blogger said IN THE BLOGGER'S OPINION Janet's comments were "anti-equity, anti-trans, anti-Black, and anti-choice." The blogger then told the company they were going to name who Janet worked for and wanted to know if the company shared her values.</p><p>Janet was sent a cold, one-sentence email that said "Compass has decided to part ways with you." I'll let Janet tell you the rest.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Got it? Now prepare yourself. Because this mother was so radical, unhinged, and extreme she <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/oregon-dad-school-board" target="_blank">told a school board</a>:</p><p>- She has a big concern with what is being taught to children as young as ten.</p><p>- She questions gender identity being taught in math classes, taking time away from teaching math.</p><p>- She believes we shouldn't be teaching children things that are not scientifically accurate or medically correct.</p><p>- She wonders about telling ten-year-olds they can receive puberty blockers "to prevent them from changes that make them uncomfortable."</p><p>- She also thinks it's inappropriate to teach twelve-year-olds about oral and anal sex.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>It would appear, judging by their actions, the publically traded corporation Compass wants your preteens to be taught about butt sex and to take life-altering drugs as children. They also do not believe parents should be allowed any opinion that contradicts the radical Left's agenda to target kids.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
