<p id="lLqSvN">Dunk says Chrome will show extensions that fall under those categories in a “Safety check” section in the privacy and security part of Chrome’s settings. “When a user clicks ‘Review,’ they will be taken to their extensions and given the choice to either remove the extension or hide...</p>

  <p id="3a5QUK">8BitDo is launching a new supersmall wireless gaming controller designed for Nintendo Switch and Android devices that could literally fit <em>inside</em> the palm of your hand. The company’s new Micro controller, which comes in blue and green, is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-Micro-Game-Controller-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0CDG5HCCH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">available to preorder</a> on Amazon for $24.99 each and will start shipping next week.</p>
<p id="SfXRpP">Fans of 8BitDo’s excellent retro gaming controllers will probably remember the company’s previous hand-cramping and ultracompact wireless controller: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/3/21048598/8bitdo-zero-2-keychain-bluetooth-controller-nintendo-switch">the Zero 2</a>. The Micro seems to be the Zero 2’s spiritual successor, increasing its button count from 12 to 16 while still staying keychain-sized and lightweight at 24.8 grams. (The Zero 2 is 20 grams, and Joy-Cons are around 50 grams comparatively.)</p>

  <p id="TkHNvg">New York City is banning TikTok from city-owned devices and requiring agencies to remove the app within the next 30 days.</p>
<p id="mN0HCH">The directive issued Wednesday comes after a review by the NYC Cyber Command which a city official said found that TikTok “posed a security threat to the city’s technical networks.” Starting immediately, city employees are barred from downloading or using the app and accessing TikTok’s website from any city-owned devices.</p>
<p id="rue1Zw">“While social media is great at connecting New Yorkers with one another and the city, we have to ensure we are always using these platforms in a secure manner,” a NYC City Hall spokesperson said in a statement to <em>The Verge </em>Wednesday. “NYC Cyber Command regularly explores and advances proactive...</p>

<p id="VvjJvP">Microsoft describes the new Game Bar integration for Teams as “a place to hang out while watching and playing games,” which sounds a lot like what people use Discord for. You’ll see friends overlaid on top of a game, and up to 20 people can join a call at any one time.</p>

The wireless peripheral retains the central analog stick and original color scheme — sorry, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23774468/clear-transparent-tech-gadgets-news-announcements-products">translucent purple</a> stans — but this time around, it features a number of quality-of-life improvements, including wireless connectivity and USB-C charging.

In the latest update to the Wear OS 2 companion app, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/08/15/google-assistant-wear-os/"><em>9to5Google</em> spotted</a> a string urging users to upgrade to Wear OS 3 because Google Assistant support is “ending soon.” </p>

Creator Bryan Lee O’Malley is working on the show, director Edgar Wright also returned, and the live-action cast including the likes of Michael Cera, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Kieran Culkin, Anna Kendrick, Brie Larson, Alison Pill, Aubrey Plaza, and Ellen Wong will all be voicing their characters again.

  <p id="RnTwXo">Ever wonder what it’s like to work at Tesla, the biggest, most exciting car company in the world? Elon Musk is known for setting lofty goals and expecting nothing short of perfection from his workers. He often urges his employees to go “super hardcore” or “ultra hardcore” — an ethos he recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23551060/elon-musk-twitter-takeover-layoffs-workplace-salute-emoji">brought to X / Twitter</a>. </p>
<p id="MieRg7">But that ethos has real-world implications for the people who work at Tesla. For the second episode of <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/LOTGTesla?sid=sitepost"><em>Land of the Giants: The Tesla Shock Wave</em></a>, we talked to the employees who often bear the brunt of this “hardcore” work culture. And their stories may shock you: extremely long hours, unsafe working conditions, harassment, scandals, fines, lawsuits, and above all else, a fear that one false slip will lead to termination. </p>

  <p id="EBvchz"><em>Vampire Survivors</em> with a friend is surprisingly slow. Typically, the indie hit feels frantic as your character automatically uses various weapons so you can defeat waves of oncoming enemies, scoop up experience gems, and race toward far-strung items across levels. The perfectly tuned colors and sounds that make the game feel like walking through a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/19/22941145/vampire-survivors-early-access-steam-pc-mac-luca-galante">pixel-packed casino</a> add to the chaos.</p>
<p id="NRbRev">But when playing <em>Vampire Survivors</em> with my wife on the Nintendo Switch, I noticed that I was suddenly being a lot more thoughtful with every move I made. The game’s new co-op mode forces you to share a screen with up to three of your friends, and that meant my wife and I were constantly communicating so that we could safely inch around levels and use our...</p>

  <p id="vFlYtw">Dell’s new <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-24-touch-usb-c-hub-monitor-p2424ht/apd/210-bhsf/monitors-monitor-accessories" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">24 Touch USB-C Hub Monitor</a> is a new 23.8-inch 1080p monitor that can effectively transform into a touchscreen tablet thanks to its articulating stand. Dell is pitching the monitor for use in retail or warehouse environments, in addition to homes and offices. The company has produced monitors with a similar form-factor in the past, such as the <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/dell-p2418ht-24-inch-touchscreen-monitor,4981.html">P2418HT which dates back to at least 2017</a>. </p>
<p id="RWZmvZ">Like the P2418HT before it, the new P2424HT’s design can’t help but remind me of Microsoft’s lineup of Surface Studio computers, which also feature touchscreens and articulating stands that allow them to be used like graphics tablets. But at just $519.99, Dell’s new monitor is clearly in a completely different league from last year’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/12/23400291/microsoft-surface-studio-2-plus-release-date-price-specs">Surface...</a></p>

  <p id="qydx4N">Apple has moved end call button once again with the latest iOS 17 developer beta. Now, it lives in the lower middle of the call screen instead of on the lower right. It’s a little change, but it might mean that iOS 17’s new call controls won’t feel quite as different once Apple officially rolls out the new software <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23787281/ios-17-preview-standby-live-transcription-stickers-keyboard">sometime this fall</a>.</p>
<p id="fQpBmF">The end call button has been in a new place since the first iOS 17 beta that was released in June, but it got some attention recently after some publications reported on the <a href="https://gizmodo.com/apple-iphone-move-end-call-ios-17-beta-1850721425">right-aligned</a>. If the comments in our article on the change <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/10/23827002/ios-17-end-call-button-moved">from last week</a> are any indication, many didn’t like the button’s new position, and the negative reaction may have contributed to Apple’s decision to put the end call button...</p>
