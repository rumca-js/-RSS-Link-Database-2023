<p>Earlier this year, Pew Research <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-adults-are-spending-less-time-on-twitter-since-elon-musk-took-over-192939586.html"><ins>reported</ins></a> that a majority of US Twitter users reported spending less time on the platform since Elon Musk’s takeover last year. Now, new data suggests another important group of users are also pulling back from the service now called X.</p><p>More than half of scientific researchers who use Twitter report they’ve reduced the amount of time they spend there or have left altogether, according to <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c6c965be-a8ea-473d-89f4-9754f2675a60&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nature+Research&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjNmM5NjViZS1hOGVhLTQ3M2QtODlmNC05NzU0ZjI2NzVhNjAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmF0dXJlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9kNDE1ODYtMDIzLTAyNTU0LTAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjEzZmNmYjgwLTIwMmQtNGU5Zi1iYWY1LTVkYjEwODBlMDE5MiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXmH1AXbKzAajRbfrym0DBqmQ7GfRc0buDXC8btFDWCu&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fd41586-023-02554-0"><ins>a survey</ins></a> of thousands of scientists conducted by <em>Nature</em>. And nearly half of those polled said they’ve turned to alternative social networks like Mastodon</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Of the 9,200 researchers polled, more than 47 percent said they had decreased their usage of the site, while nearly 7 percent reported quitting the site altogether. Notably, almost the same number said they had started an account on at least one new platform over the last year.</p><p>Of these, Mastodon, which has seen <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-client-developers-fleeing-twitter-mastodon-130031551.html"><ins>significant growth</ins></a> since Musk’s takeover of Twitter was announced, was the most widely used. About 47 percent of researchers said they had started using the open-source platform in the past year. LinkedIn and Instagram were the next most popular, drawing 35 and 27 percent of researchers, respectively. Interestingly, Meta’s Twitter competitor, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/one-week-in-threads-has-become-twitters-biggest-threat-140050889.html"><ins>Threads</ins></a>, took the number four spot even though the app launched only days before <em>Nature</em> conducted the poll.</p><p>As with the earlier data from Pew, <em>Nature’s</em> findings suggest that Twitter usage is down among those who were once active on the platform. It also highlights how much the dynamics of Twitter have changed over the last year.</p><p>Twitter, as <em>Nature</em> points out, has historically been an important platform for researchers and scientists. It’s been used to publicize research and promote scientific debate. And Twitter’s researchers have served as an important source of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-verified-more-than-1000-health-experts-new-verification-push-170028498.html"><ins>authoritative</ins></a> information on a platform that's long struggled to combat misinformation. Twitter has also been a valuable source <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-api-for-academic-research-190046995.html"><ins>of data</ins></a> for countless researchers studying everything from public health to linguistics.</p><p>But much of that has now changed. Many users now feel that their voices are drowned out on a platform that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitters-video-and-ranking-perks-arrive-to-paying-blue-subscribers-125538009.html"><ins>prioritizes content</ins></a> from those with paid verification. And the company has made its API for researchers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-shut-off-its-free-api-and-its-breaking-a-lot-of-apps-222011637.html"><ins>so expensive</ins></a> that most can no longer access it. So while not all the researchers that spoke to <em>Nature</em> were ready to give up on Twitter entirely, it does seem the company’s tactics have alienated large swaths of the scientific community.</p><p>X didn't respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/scientists-are-pulling-back-from-twitter-and-looking-for-alternatives-231159359.html?src=rss

## New AP guidelines lay the groundwork for AI-assisted newsrooms

<p><em>The Associated Press</em> published standards today for generative AI use in its newsroom. The organization, which has a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ap-and-openai-enter-into-two-year-partnership-to-help-train-algorithmic-models-183007344.html">licensing agreement with ChatGPT maker OpenAI</a>, listed a fairly restrictive and common-sense <a href="https://blog.ap.org/standards-around-generative-ai">list of measures</a> around the burgeoning tech while cautioning its staff not to use AI to make publishable content. Although nothing in the new guidelines is particularly controversial, less scrupulous outlets could view the <em>AP</em>’s blessing as a license to use generative AI more excessively or underhandedly.</p><p>The organization’s AI manifesto underscores a belief that artificial intelligence content should be treated as the flawed tool that it is — not a replacement for trained writers, editors and reporters exercising their best judgment. “We do not see AI as a replacement of journalists in any way,” the <em>AP</em>’s Vice President for Standards and Inclusion, Amanda Barrett, wrote in an article about its approach to AI today. “It is the responsibility of <em>AP</em> journalists to be accountable for the accuracy and fairness of the information we share.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The article directs its journalists to view AI-generated content as “unvetted source material,” to which editorial staff “must apply their editorial judgment and <em>AP</em>’s sourcing standards when considering any information for publication.” It says employees may “experiment with ChatGPT with caution” but not create publishable content with it. That includes images, too. “In accordance with our standards, we do not alter any elements of our photos, video or audio,” it states. “Therefore, we do not allow the use of generative AI to add or subtract any elements.” However, it carved an exception for stories where <a href="https://www.engadget.com/midjourney-ends-free-trials-of-its-ai-image-generator-due-to-extraordinary-abuse-153853905.html">AI illustrations or art</a> are a story’s subject — and even then, it has to be clearly labeled as such.</p><p>Barrett warns about AI’s potential for spreading misinformation. To prevent the accidental publishing of anything AI-created that appears authentic, she says <em>AP</em> journalists “should exercise the same caution and skepticism they would normally, including trying to identify the source of the original content, doing a reverse image search to help verify an image’s origin, and checking for reports with similar content from trusted media.” To protect privacy, the guidelines also prohibit writers from entering “confidential or sensitive information into AI tools.”</p><p>Although that’s a relatively common-sense and uncontroversial set of rules, other media outlets have been less discerning. <em>CNET</em> was caught early this year publishing error-ridden <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cnet-corrected-41-of-its-77-ai-written-articles-201519489.html">AI-generated financial explainer articles</a> (only labeled as computer-made if you clicked on the article’s byline). <em>Gizmodo</em> found itself in a similar spotlight this summer when it ran a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/08/gizmodo-ai-errors-star-wars/">Star Wars article full of inaccuracies</a>. It’s not hard to imagine other outlets — desperate for an edge in the highly competitive media landscape — viewing the <em>AP</em>’s (tightly restricted) AI use as a green light to make robot journalism a central figure in their newsrooms, publishing poorly edited / inaccurate content or failing to label AI-generated work as such.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/new-ap-guidelines-lay-the-groundwork-for-ai-assisted-newsrooms-201009363.html?src=rss

<p>My AI, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-adds-openai-powered-chatbot-and-proactively-apologizes-for-what-it-might-say-180507261.html">in-app digital assistant that rides herd</a> on your Snapchat Plus experience, has suffered numerous breakdowns and technical malfunctions since its debut in February. Tuesday was more of the same as the chatbot took it upon itself to post single-second-long Stories to users' feeds and then go unresponsive for extended periods of time. Thing is, My AI doesn't have the capacity to post to Stories.

## Solo Stove introduces a $349 gas-only version of its Pi pizza oven

<p>Solo Stove may have made its name <a href="https://www.engadget.com/solo-stoves-fire-pit-20-removable-base-plate-ash-pan-cleanup-143100211.html">with fire pits</a>, but the company also sells pizza ovens. Today, it's adding a second model: the Pi Prime. This version offers the same overall design and features from the original dual-fuel Pi, a total package that earned a spot on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-pizza-oven-141550352.html">best pizza ovens</a> list. But the Prime is gas-only and it's more affordable at $349.&nbsp;</p><p>Like the Pi, the Pi Prime has a "demi-dome" construction and a round shape akin to Solo Stove's fire pits. The panoramic opening remains in the front, giving you plenty of room to maneuver 12-inch pizzas and other foods in the cooking chamber. Inside, there's a two-piece stone that can be easily removed for transport or cleaning. The key difference on the Pi Prime is the built-in gas burner that makes this oven a self-contained unit — aside from a propane tank. There's a flame control knob up front that you push and turn to ignite the fire, in addition to using the dial to adjust the temperature. Lastly, the Pi Prime has a black base where the Pi has an all-stainless-steel construction.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Solo Stove has designated "a workable baseline" for baking pizzas with two orange indicators on the front-mounted knob. According to the Pi Prime startup guide, this is around 700 degrees Fahrenheit and enough to cook a pizza in under 90 seconds. However, the company says the oven is capable of temperatures over 950 degrees and you're able to go lower than 700 should you need to. Solo Stove didn't specify the full temperature range, but those orange marks are just beyond halfway on the dial.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="Solo Stove Pi Prime" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/be810b90-3c5c-11ee-bbaf-ac0b35a437b0" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Solo Stove/Matthew King</div></figure><p>The company also has a slate of accessories for the Pi and Pi Prime that are due to arrive at the end of the month. Those include a cover for the newer model, cast iron grill pan, a regular cast iron pan, dough docker, wire cleaning brush, rocker pizza cutter and a prep board with built-in toppings containers. Solo Stove already sells a cart for its pizza ovens, the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f5421854-3d3e-46b7-ba38-db91920c7f00&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Solo+Stove&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmNTQyMTg1NC0zZDNlLTQ2YjctYmEzOC1kYjkxOTIwYzdmMDAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc29sb3N0b3ZlLmNvbS9lbi11cy9wL3BpLXN0YW5kIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzYjMyMTA5Ni0wNTQ4LTQ4ZDgtOTM0Yi00ZGUxNWJlYzNjM2EifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQZWsZJmJ4MkiQrMHWdOZPzzHhr9tFMivyuYxfOAfDtY&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.solostove.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fpi-stand">Pi Stand</a>, that has side shelves, a place to rest your peel under the oven and a spot for a propane tank.

## Steam Remote Play now officially supports 4K gaming

<p>Valve just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053?emclan=103582791433918461&amp;emgid=5651507201768194518"><ins>dropped a Steam Client Beta update</ins></a> that finally introduces a sought-after feature. The Steam Remote Play service will now offer 4K support, providing a series of presets to allow gamers to find the perfect high-res settings for preferred titles. Prior to this update, 4K was still possible when playing remotely, but it required plenty of experimentation with settings and didn’t always work right. This should fix many of those issues.</p><p>This move lets gamers finally make use out of high-end peripherals, like 4K monitors, when engaging with remote streaming play. For the uninitiated, Steam Remote Play is a useful service that streams PC games from your Steam library to phones, tablets, laptops and related devices. Its sibling service, Steam Remote Play Together, adds online multiplayer to the mix, actually allowing players who don’t even own the game to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/steam-remote-play-together-out-of-beta-070308920.html"><ins>join in competitive or co-op play.</ins></a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>4K streaming isn’t the only new feature included in this update, though it’s certainly the most notable. Valve also now allows users to resize the settings window and it has made the back button more reliable when making minute adjustments, like fiddling with 4K streams. The company also fixed a whole bunch of bugs, like folders not being re-created when verifying game installations and overlays freezing when file dialogs are displayed.</p><p>Finally, Big Picture Mode received some minor bug fixes and Steam added support for the Indonesian language. The update is available for download now, but <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/276C-85A0-C531-AFA3"><ins>this is a beta</ins></a> so you may want to wait until an official final release.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/steam-remote-play-now-officially-supports-4k-gaming-182020228.html?src=rss

<p>New York City will ban TikTok from government devices, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/16/23834579/nyc-tiktok-ban-new-york-china-surveillance-spy"><em>The Verge reported</em></a> on Wednesday. City agencies have 30 days to remove the ByteDance-owned app from their devices. Employees will not be allowed to download or use TikTok on their city-sanctioned tech effective immediately. This comes three years after New York state banned TikTok from government devices in 2020, <a href="https://www.timesunion.com/state/article/n-y-quietly-banned-tiktok-government-devices-17886372.php">according to <em>Times-Union</em></a>.</p><p>NYC Cyber Command, a subset of the Office of Technology and Innovation, spurred the decision after reporting to the city that TikTok posed a security threat. Other states and localities, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/montanas-governor-signs-bill-banning-tiktok-225326086.html">notably Montana</a>, have made waves banning TikTok more generally across the jurisdiction. But on a wider scale, most legislators have taken an approach banning the app for government employees, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-us-government-ban-devices-omnibus-bill-funding-nasa-234803320.html">including the federal government</a>.

<p>Who's ready for some (bad opinions from the internet while you watch) football? <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/youtube/"><ins>YouTube</ins></a> has <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/nfl-sunday-ticket-features-guide/">revealed</a> some more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/nfl-sunday-ticket/">NFL Sunday Ticket</a> features for the upcoming season. As you watch games, you'll be able to view a live chat and read what other people think about a certain play or call. Live chat and polls will be available on both mobile and TVs.</p><p>YouTube users will be able to watch real-time NFL highlights on Shorts. On Sunday afternoons, these highlights will include a red Live ring around the channel's avatar, and clicking on this will take users to the NFL channel's Live tab. There, Sunday Ticket subscribers can decide which game (or games, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-will-allow-unlimited-simultaneous-streams-for-nfl-sunday-ticket-142049241.html">thanks to the multiview options</a>) to start watching.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>One other thing that could be helpful for viewers is key plays, a handy YouTube TV feature that the platform is bringing over to Sunday Ticket. You'll be able to catch up on a game that you couldn't watch or check out big plays before joining the live action. This feature will only be available on TVs this season, which is the first under a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-nfl-sunday-ticket-deal-155108503.html"><ins>multibillion-dollar, seven-year pact</ins></a> that YouTube has with the NFL for Sunday Ticket rights.</p><p>Naturally, YouTube is looking to recoup its investment on Sunday Ticket and it's now offering fans more ways to sign up. Starting today, there will be a monthly payment plan option for Sunday Ticket in most states to help fans spread the cost of a subscription over a longer period. It may take a few days before the option is available on YouTube and YouTube TV in your area.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the monthly plan <a href="https://support.google.com/youtubetv/answer/13316318#payments&amp;zippy=%2Ccan-i-pay-monthly-for-nfl-sunday-ticket"><ins>won't be available</ins></a> to folks in Georgia, New York, Minnesota, Nevada, Missouri, Tennessee or New Jersey.

<p>Amazon is tightening the purse strings again, raising prices for Music Unlimited subscriptions. This latest increase impacts Prime members and family plan users, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/amazon-price-amazon-music-unlimited-for-prime-members-1235567419/"><ins>as originally spotted by </ins><em><ins>The Hollywood Reporter.</ins></em></a> The Amazon Music Unlimited Individual Plan for Prime members is going up from $9 to $10 per month, or $89 to $99 per year. The Amazon Music Unlimited Family Plan is shooting up from $16 to $17 per month, or $159 to $169 per year.</p><p>These rates begin immediately for new subscribers, but pre-existing customers have a grace period until September 19 before they kick in. As for the why, Amazon magnanimously stated that the price hikes will help bring “even more content and features.” Aw, shucks. You shouldn’t have.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Of course, this isn’t the first time Amazon has raised Music Unlimited prices this year. Back in January, the costs went up for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-music-streaming-prices-are-going-up-in-the-us-and-uk-110551222.html"><ins>students and non-Prime subscribers,</ins></a> and last year <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-music-unlimited-price-is-going-up-a-dollar-to-899-for-prime-members-074553977.html"><ins>Prime members got yet another increase.</ins></a> So, basically Prime members saw prices jettison from $8 per month to $10 per month in just over a year. That’s a lot of new content and features.</p><p>Amazon isn’t the only streamer taking extra dips into our bank accounts. Just about every known streaming service has been raising prices this past year. YouTube Premium <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-premium-quietly-goes-up-in-price-to-14-per-month-100531473.html"><ins>went up form $12 to $14 per month,</ins></a> Tidal got an increase, Apple Music and Apple TV+ <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-tv-plus-one-price-increase-173909045.html"><ins>experienced price hikes,</ins></a> Spotify shot up <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-raises-iprice-of-premium-plans-115138529.html"><ins>from $10 to $11 per month</ins></a> and that’s just the beginning. Other streaming services like Peacock, Paramount+, Hulu and Max all raised their prices, likely to add those new content and features everyone’s been talking about.</p><p>In related news, Amazon Music Unlimited <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/cathyolson/2021/03/03/are-music-streaming-companies-finally-ready-to-change-the-way-they-pay-artists/?sh=542f0d1a72f6"><ins>pays artists around $5,000 per million streams,</ins></a> which is in line with Apple Music and Spotify. In a perfect world, some of that price hike money would go to the people that actually make the stuff that populate these platforms. This is not a perfect world.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/amazon-music-unlimited-raises-subscription-prices-again-164553310.html?src=rss

## 8BitDo stuffed 16 buttons into its hand-crampingly small Micro controller

<p>Measuring a mere 72 x 40.7 x 14.1 mm — just over half the length of the original <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-23-nintendo-entertainment-system-reader-review-roundup.html">NES controller</a> — the 8BitDo Micro is a spiritual successor to the company’s Zero line of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-25-8bitdo-switch-controller-keychain-zero-2.html">similarly minuscule gamepads</a>. It also hurts my hands just to look at it.</p><p>The 8BitDo Micro pairs via Bluetooth with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-oled-review-130025998.html">Nintendo Switch</a>, Android and Raspberry Pi. The wee little thing weighs 24.8 grams, includes a mode-switching button and supports button mapping via 8BitDo Ultimate Software. The company says it has a 180mAh battery that will last 10 hours of playtime and can fully recharge in one to two hours. However, it also works in wired mode (via USB-C) when you don’t mind being tethered to your gaming system.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Marketing photo of a person holding an 8BitDo Micro (tiny blue) controller in their left hand and an Apple Pencil in their right hand as they sketch in an illustration app on an iPad.

It includes four standard action buttons (A, B, X, Y), face buttons (plus, minus, star and checkered flag) and shoulder bumpers / triggers. (The latter is one way it differs from 8BitDo’s Zero 2.) It can work in keyboard mode, which opens up some compatibility with macOS, Windows and iOS — and you can assign shortcuts to use it as a remote control for tasks like photo or video editing. It's an impressive amount of IO to cram into a form factor that makes Joy-Cons look like the front face of an arcade cabinet.</p><p>The 8BitDo Micro launches today in blue and green.

## Steam changes could increase game prices in some countries

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/valve/"><ins>Valve</ins></a> has updated <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/steam/"><ins>Steam's</ins></a> minimum pricing policy for some non-USD currencies, which could impact those who sell games and expansions for less than the equivalent of $5. The company <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/3700310527377680732"><ins>warned publishers and developers</ins></a> that the move could lead to games and DLC using lower pricing being unavailable to purchase in some regions if they don't make adjustments, while they may not be able to offer discounts as deeply as they used to.</p><p>According to Valve, the aim of the revised policy is to align minimum pricing with recommended currency conversions the company <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/3314110913449340511?snr=2_groupannouncements_detail_">issued last October</a>. It updated those recommendations &quot;to adjust for some currencies drifting significantly in value over time.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As such, the base price for a game or expansion must be at least the equivalent of 99 cents. The minimum price for a discounted game or DLC is the equivalent of 49 cents.&nbsp;</p><p>Developers and publishers may need to change the pricing of their products in some countries. As <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/tweaks-to-steam-minimum-price-thresholds-could-impact-some-developers"><em><ins>Game Developer</ins></em></a> notes, they'll have to be mindful of how they handle discounts too. Publishers and developers of games that usually cost $4.99 or less will need to make sure they avoid going below the threshold during sales. Valve offers price management and discount tools on Steam to help them navigate such issues.</p><p>The move may also impact players who create Steam accounts in different countries to take advantage of regional price differences. While the new thresholds won't necessarily impact blockbuster games, they could make it somewhat less viable for players to change their virtual location to the likes of Turkey and Argentina to pick up a grab bag of indie games and other deeply discounted titles.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/steam-changes-could-increase-game-prices-in-some-countries-154516181.html?src=rss

## The Rodecaster Duo podcast mixer proves bigger isn't always better

<p>A couple of years ago, you might have described Rode as a company that makes microphones. Today, it’s positioning itself more as a one-stop-shop for creator tools. The original <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rode-rodecaster-pro-updates-133049239.html">Rodecaster Pro</a> podcast mixer was the first big step in this evolution. That includes the new, gaming-focused “Rode X” <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rode-x-unify-game-streaming-xdm-100-xcm-50-030005357.html">sub-brand</a> and products like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rodes-streamer-x-combines-an-audio-interface-with-an-external-capture-card-221321424.html">Streamer X capture card</a>. The company, of course, still makes a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rode-claims-its-new-podcast-friendly-nt1-offers-unclippable-audio-230009586.html">microphone</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rodes-wireless-me-squeezes-a-second-mic-into-its-receiver-000009619.html">two</a>. But, with the new, smaller, more affordable and very capable <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Sb2RlLVJvZGVDYXN0ZXItRHVvLVN0cmVhbWluZy1NaXhlci9kcC9CMEJRTEpZU0JYP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTF0cS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMDZhZmVkOTAtNDhjYi00ZWMyLWEwZGEtYjM3N2JmNGQxODQyIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAdrEJyAqz3U2fA2Cl-Oldul6Y94Etyvw9dkN4iXGXZqw&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FRode-RodeCaster-Duo-Streaming-Mixer%2Fdp%2FB0BQLJYSBX">Rodecaster Duo</a> stream mixer, this move toward general creators is basically official.</p><p>The original Rodecaster Pro was the first mixing desk specifically designed for podcasters to really catch people’s attention. The build-quality, price, ease of use and simple workflow struck a chord with pros and amateurs alike. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rodecaster-pro-ii-details-000035416.html">Rodecaster Pro II</a> ($699) went in a slightly different direction, introducing the ability to route different audio sources to different places, an essential tool for game streamers. The pads were upgraded from simple audio triggers to multi-purpose smart pads that can be used for MIDI, vocal effects and more. The second version also came in with a smaller footprint, removing two physical faders and making them “virtual.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Rodecaster Duo ($499) is arguably just the Rodcaster Pro II “mini.” The functionality is identical to its bigger sibling, but it comes with four physical faders (down from six); six pads (down from eight) and two XLR ports for microphones or instruments (down from four). You actually have control over seven mixing channels at any one time, but adjusting three of them is done via virtual faders. Importantly, you get to configure which inputs remain on physical faders and which are assigned to virtual controls in the companion software.</p><figure><img alt="Rear view of the Rodecaster Duo showing the main input and output ports." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/266317f0-376f-11ee-95cf-e0b58b94ad3e" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Two other small changes include the removal of the “record” button, which is now virtual/on the display, and there’s also a headphone port on the front edge. This last change solves one of my main nitpicks with Rodecaster Pro II, which only had headphone ports around the back. The port on the front is 3.5mm rather than 1/4 -inch and is compatible with headset/TRRS mics, adding another input effectively — one that’s particularly handy for game streamers.</p><p>One of the biggest upgrades from the original Rodecaster Pro is the addition of a second USB-C port around the back which can connect to a second PC. This is a massive boon for streamers who want to keep their gaming rig separate from their streaming one, and the new routing table allows you to send whatever inputs you like to either USB connection. This same port also can be used for connecting a phone, which is perfect for introducing callers or for streaming via mobile apps. You could always connect a phone via Bluetooth on the original model, which was handy but now you have multiple options (and via cable is much better quality).</p><p>The fact that there are only two XLR combo jacks speaks strongly to who this is for. While the Rodecaster Pro and its sequel were originally built for in-person, multi-guest, podcasts, it’s also a very capable tool for solo creators which has helped fuel its popularity. And with an increasing number of tools like <a href="https://zencastr.com/">Zencastr</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/adobe-podcasts-text-based-editing-turns-limitation-into-liberation-133001520.html">Adobe Podcast</a>, the need to host fellow flesh-sacks in the same room is no longer required for high-quality audio from all speakers. As such, the Rodecaster Duo makes a lot of sense for a broad stroke of creators from podcasters to streamers and even music producers and video editors (both the Duo and the II Pro are MIDI enabled).</p><p>Be under no illusions, the Duo — and its bigger sibling — are just as “pro” friendly as the first Rodecaster, but they both lean into the creator space a bit more than the original. This point is made most clearly by the very existence of the Duo. The smaller footprint is a clear admission that this was made to live on a desk full time alongside your other daily tools.</p><figure><img alt="The Rodecaster Duo's touchscreen display showing the mixer levels." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/61a19120-376f-11ee-bfff-0fdd8a6b1f5b" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>The Rodecaster II Pro was already a bit more manageable than the first model, but after a few weeks with the Duo, the difference is stark. It can remain nested under my monitor and easily moved into position when I go live. Before the Duo, I had the Pro II on my desk in a similar setup, but I was frequently moving it out of the way to make space for other things that it became a bit of a burden and I ended up unplugging it until show time. With the Duo it’s clear this can be a daily driver with little-to-no need to organize around it.</p><p>The number of tools for creators and streamers is expanding exponentially, and with that are more direct rivals to the Rodecaster series. In fact, just days after the Rodecaster Duo was announced, Boss unveiled its own take on the category with the Gigcaster 8 ($699) and Gigcaster 5 ($459). Both offer very similar features to Rode’s products in a generally smaller footprint. The Gigcaster 8 is a near 1:1 in terms of functionality to the Pro II, while the Gigcaster 5 sacrifices the physical trigger pads to make way for two more physical faders — six total — over the Duo’s four to create an even smaller footprint. Though it has a slight focus on musicians via some sound presets and effects, and doesn’t quite match the overall build quality and polish as the Rode.</p><p>Rode’s audio chops are also not to be underestimated. The pre-amps and headphone outputs on the Duo are capital-L loud and squeaky clean with a very low noise floor. When the products were announced, Rode went out of its way to show how well it could power the notoriously quiet (and insanely popular) SM7B microphone. When you’re giving a shout out to a rival company’s product to demonstrate a feature, you better be confident that the feature you’re touting does the goods. And surely it does. The amount of clean gain to drive microphones such as the aforementioned Shure classic is impressive and a step up from the already-decent Rodecaster Pro before it.</p><figure><img alt="The Rodecaster Duo pictured on a desk with a keyboard and headphones." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/e9ca9790-376f-11ee-9f5b-decbc99fe534" style="height: 1318px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>In short, the Rodecaster Duo feels like a product that Rode maybe didn’t initially think was the main event. It’s the smaller, more affordable version of its flagship mixer after all. It turns out that this is likely the one that most solo creators will actually want. Even pros might want to consider the Duo over the Pro II if they don’t absolutely need the capacity to run four microphones in tandem.</p><p>It’s worth mentioning that if you’re considering moving over to the Duo from something like the GoXLR or the Razer Audio Mixer know that Rode’s take on a routing table is a little different to what you might be used to. The Duo’s companion software is generally pretty good, but it doesn’t use the conventional “table” format many streamers will be used to. Instead it’s a little bit convoluted, but once you get the hang of it, it’s quite powerful. This is particularly handy if you’re in the business of recording audio from multiple sources. I often just use the routing options so I can record either one or both sides of a phone call or online meeting depending on my needs, but it’s also good for feeding PC audio — including Zoom calls or YouTube videos etc. — into, well, wherever you want it to go, including your phone.</p><p>If you do any kind of live audio production or recording, especially podcasts, the Rodecaster Duo is an easy sell. For streamers, it’s also a very capable device, one that’s also easy to recommend, but with a small asterisk. Streaming setups and their associated platforms are often a little more to their host’s tastes and preferences. As such, the Duo’s suitability will depend on what you’re used to and the specifics of what you want to do. But for most creators, the Duo is the better option over the Pro II at the very least.</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/rodecaster-duo-review-153032883.html?src=rss

## NCSoft's new AI suite is trained to streamline game production

<p>Despite being publicly available for less than a year, generative AI technology can already be found all around us, helping us browse the internet, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/natural-language-programming-ais-are-taking-the-drudgery-out-of-coding-140015594.html">taking the drudgery</a> out of computer coding, and even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisofts-ghostwriter-ai-tool--automatically-generate-video-game-dialogue-103510366.html">improving the dialog</a> in popular video game franchises. On Wednesday, NCSoft, the South Korean game developer and publisher behind  long-running MMORPG <em>Guild Wars</em>, announced that it has developed four new AI large language models, dubbed VARCO, to help streamline future game development.</p><p>VARCO (&quot;Via AI, Realize your Creativity and Originality,&quot; if you squint just right) is both the quartet of language models the company has developed, as well as all of the products and services the company plans to build atop them. Those potential products include, “digital humans, generative AI platforms, and conversational language models,” per an NCSoft release.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The four models are VARCO the base LLM, as well as Art, Text and Human. LLM will be the first released — the Korean-language version is available August 16, while the English and bilingual iterations will arrive by the end of the month. LLM be trained with 1.3B, 6.4B and 13B parameters to start with larger versions made available later in the year.</p><p>&quot;Our LLM is trained with datasets that are either publicly available for pretraining, collected from the Internet or internally constructed,” Jehee Lee, CRO of NCSOFT, told Engadget via email. “We are putting efforts to improve the performance of LLM and generate text that does not undermine the universal values of society.”</p><p>&quot;Bias is one of our biggest concerns in the process of constructing data,&quot; Lee continued, “ In order to build high-quality datasets, NC utilizes a pipeline where collected data are analyzed and evaluated in various aspects (e.g. format, content, ethics) and are refined based on our own criteria.&quot;</p><p>Larger-parameter versions of LLM will arrive later in the year, allowing for more nuanced and complete responses from the system. “As the size of the model increases, the performance increases,” Lee notes,  “but the operating cost also increases accordingly.” As such ensuring that models are developed to be both computationally powerful and computationally lightweight is of tantamount importance, he continued.</p><div id="ae7b0fbdc1354d9da3b632e9e988f8fe"></div><p>“NC has accumulated technologies for model weight reduction and optimization as we have been applying real-time machine translation and NLP-based technologies to our games that require large-scale traffic processing in real-time,” Lee explained. “Based on our experiences, we plan to develop and sequentially release high-performance lightweight models specialized for various individual tasks in the future.”</p><p>The three additional services will be based upon that foundational model. VARCO Art, the text-to-image generator, will reportedly be capable of closely matching the work of specific artists (with their permission of course).  “With dozens of illustrations worked consistently by an artist, generative models can be trained to reveal enough of a particular style, such as coloring, touches, and outlines,” Lee said. “ Thus far, artists or experts can spot the difference, but it is not easy for ordinary people to distinguish if it is generated by AI or not.”</p><p>Additionally, VARCO Text does just that, generating and managing the core settings of a game including the plot scenarios and character worldviews, while VARCO Human, “an integrated tool for creating, editing, and managing digital humans,” per the release. Art, Text, and Human can all be used and managed within the company’s VACRO Studio suite, which will be available in 2024.</p><p>The VARCO models will initially be used to help streamline game development efforts, much in the same way as Ubisoft’s Ghostwriter. However, VARCO sets itself apart, Lee explains, in that it is a “special Vertical AI that can directly solve specific pain points regardless of industry and domain.”</p><p>“The generative model can be used for the planning, development, and operation of games.,” Lee said. “The worldview of the game, character name, type, and attributes can be created and edited. Also, it creates conversations for specific situations and quests tailored to regions,” as well as accompanying images.</p><p>And like Ghostwriter, VARCO cannot operate in isolation. “We need final human judgment and additional work in order to produce sophisticated results,” Lee said. He argues that, ”generative AI technology will contribute to further increasing the value of human labor,” by distinguishing between the two.</p><p>In allowing AI to handle the low level repetitive tasks that perpetually slow game development, human designers will be freed to “focus on more complex tasks,” Lee said. “The results of generative AI will not be the final product, but rather it will serve to inspire humans and help them quickly reach higher goals with the help of AI’s emergent and large-scale creation capabilities.”</p><p>But games are only the beginning for NC’s AI aspirations. “we want to create new high value-added businesses by entering different fields beyond games,” Less said. “I think we can advance with our AI in any industrial field rather than just one field. NC plans to pay attention to new growth fields that we can expect greater potential and synergy when combined with AI, such as fashion, life, health, mobility, bio, robotics, and content.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ncsofts-new-ai-suite-is-trained-to-streamline-game-production-141653946.html?src=rss

## The best soundbars for 2023

<p>It's no secret that the built-in speakers in most TVs are trash. They don't project enough sound out to the front so you can hear well — especially subtle details. Thankfully, you don't have to splurge for a five-speaker (or more)<a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-build-a-budget-home-theater-setup-140010399.html"> surround-sound system</a> to improve your sound experience. In most living rooms, a single soundbar and maybe a subwoofer can coax better sound from your TV. To help guide your shopping spree, we've compiled a list of everything to look for when searching for the best soundbar for you, along with a list of the top picks for a range of budgets.</p><h2>What to look for in a soundbar</h2><h3>Features</h3><p>When it comes to features, the more you pay the more you're going to get. Most affordable options ($150 or less) will improve your television's audio quality, but that's about it. Step into the $300 to $400 range and you'll find a smart soundbar with things like built-in voice control, wireless connectivity, Google Chromecast, AirPlay 2 and even Android TV. They're all helpful when you want to avoid looking for the remote control, but the best sound quality is usually only in the top tier and the formats those premium soundbar systems support. I’m talking about things like Dolby Atmos, DTS:X and other high-resolution audio standards. These are what you'll want to look for if truly immersive sound is what you crave for your living room setup. And not all Atmos soundbars are equal, so you'll need to look at the finer details carefully before you break into the savings account.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h3>Ports</h3><figure><img alt="Sony HT-A7000 soundbar, SA-SW5 subwoofer, SA-SW3 subwoofer and SA-RS3S speakers." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/cfb15b20-e904-11eb-9f99-c08983de4f5c" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure><p>This is a big one. A lot of the more affordable soundbars are limited when it comes to connectivity options. They either offer an optical port or one HDMI jack and, if you're lucky, both. Things get slightly better in the mid-range section, but that's not always the case. The Sonos Beam, for example, is $449, but only has a single HDMI port. If you want to connect your set-top box, gaming console and more directly to your soundbar for the best possible audio, you'll likely want to look for an option with at least two HDMI (eARC) inputs. HDMI connections are essential for things like Dolby Atmos, DTS:X and other high-res and immersive audio formats. And with<a href="https://www.hdmi.org/spec/hdmi2_1"> the HDMI 2.1 spec</a>, soundbars can support HDR, 8K and 4K/120 passthrough to make these speaker systems an even better companion for a game console.</p><h3>Channels</h3><p>Another big thing you’ll want to pay attention to when looking for the best soundbar is channels. That’s the 2.1, 7.1.2 or other decimal number that companies include in product descriptions. The first figure corresponds to the number of channels. A two would just be left and right while a more robust Atmos system, especially one with rear satellite speakers, could be five or seven (left, right, center and upward). The second number refers to the subwoofer, so if your new soundbar comes with one or has them built in, you’ll see a one here. The third numeral is up-firing speakers, important for the immersive effect of Dolby Atmos. Not all Atmos-enabled units have them, but if they do, the third number will tell you how many are in play.</p><h3>Wireless</h3><figure><img alt="Sony HT-A7000 soundbar, SA-SW5 subwoofer, SA-SW3 subwoofer and SA-RS3S speakers." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/cff960a0-e904-11eb-ad7a-7525dbfffb3a" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure><p>Most soundbars these days offer either Bluetooth, WiFi or both. When it comes to WiFi, that connectivity affords you luxuries like voice control (either built-in or with a separate device), Chromecast, Spotify Connect and AirPlay 2. Depending on your preferences, you might be able to live without some of these. For me, AirPlay 2 and Chromecast are essentials, but the rest I can live without. Those two give me the ability to beam music and podcasts from my go-to apps without having to settle for — or struggle with — a Bluetooth connection.</p><h3>Size</h3><p>This one might seem obvious but humor me for a minute. Nothing is more soul-crushing than getting a pricey soundbar in your living room only to discover you have to rearrange everything to find a spot for it. This was my plight when the<a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TZW5uaGVpc2VyLUFNQkVPLVNvdW5kYmFyLTUtMS00LUNoYW5uZWwvZHAvQjA4Sjk5UjhXSj90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1jaS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZTBhOTBkN2YtODQ5ZS00NGYwLWJjNGQtODY3MmM4M2QwMDZkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAdSXCtH3GZlqKOEeTxYF-ucIgg9x4QArao7UtuglYKcD&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSennheiser-AMBEO-Soundbar-5-1-4-Channel%2Fdp%2FB08J99R8WJ%3F"> Sennheiser Ambeo Soundbar</a> arrived at my door. Yes, that speaker is absurdly large (and heavy), and most soundbars aren't nearly as big. I learned a valuable lesson: Make sure the space where you want to put a soundbar will accommodate the thing you're about to spend hundreds (if not thousands) of dollars on.</p><p>Basically, it all comes down to the TV you have (or are planning to get) and what the primary goal is for your living-room audio. Is it ease of use? Do you want the best possible sound from a single speaker or speaker/sub combo? Do you just want to be able to actually hear your TV better? Or do you want to turn your living room into an immersive home theater system with surround sound?</p><p>By paying attention to each of those areas, you should have a good idea of what to look for in a soundbar, soundbar/subwoofer combo or a more robust setup. With that said, we've put numerous products through their paces at Engadget and have a few favorites for best soundbar at various price points to get you started.</p><h2>The Best Soundbars</h2><p></p><h2>Best premium soundbar: Sony HT-A7000</h2><p></p><p>Sony has a long track record of excellent high-end soundbars and<a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-ht-a7000-soundbar-ht-a9-home-theater-system-140038379.html"> its latest</a> is another great-sounding product.

## With some tech savvy, you can disconnect your robot vacuum from the cloud

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-robot-vacuums-130010426.html">Robot vacuums</a> may seem like mindless suction machines with wheels. But today, “​​basically these devices are like smartphones,” Dennis Giese, PhD student at Northeastern University who researches robot vacuum security, said. From internet capabilities to video recording to voice control, robot vacuums have become an advanced Internet of Things technology, but the security upkeep hasn’t caught up.</p><p>“You don't have any insight, what kind of data they’re recording, what kind of data is stored on the device, what kind of data is sent to the cloud,” Giese told Engadget. That might seem harmless for a device that sweeps your floors, but the real-life consequences have already taken effect.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Like in 2022 when the <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/12/19/1065306/roomba-irobot-robot-vacuums-artificial-intelligence-training-data-privacy/">iRobot Roomba J7 captured private moments</a> including photos of a woman on the toilet that the company sent to startup Scale AI to label and train AI algorithms. Amazon, which has experienced countless <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7b3gj/amazon-told-drivers-not-to-worry-about-in-van-surveillance-cameras-now-footage-is-leaking-online">surveillance</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-failed-to-protect-your-data-investigation/">data privacy</a> scandals, is currently attempting to acquire iRobot for over $1.4 billion.</p><p>With all these features, robot vacuums can act as a surveillance system in your own home, meaning there’s a world where someone can access live view functions and spy on you. Companies can say this information is secure and only used when needed to improve your experience, but there’s not enough transparency for reviewers or consumers to figure out what’s actually going on. “People like me are catching the companies basically lying,” Giese said.</p><p>So, Giese is on a mission to give people more control over the robot vacuums in their homes because every device he’s tested has some sort of vulnerability. He spoke at DEF CON on Sunday about how people can hack their devices to disconnect from the cloud. Not only does this help protect your data from being used by the company, but it also gives access to the device so that you can repair it on your own terms. The “<a href="https://search.engadget.com/search;_ylc=X3IDMgRncHJpZAN6dXdhM2xZRVRMMmVHZVJ1dnhrMmhBBG5fc3VnZwM5BHBvcwMwBHBxc3RyAwRwcXN0cmwDMARxc3RybAMxNQRxdWVyeQNyaWdodCUyMHRvJTIwcmVwYWlyBHRfc3RtcAMxNjkxNDQ0Mjkz?p=right+to+repair&amp;fr=engadget">right to repair</a>” ethos means that even if the warranty ends or the company goes bankrupt and stops supporting it, you can still use it.</p><p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://robotinfo.dev/">hacking into your robot vacuum’s firmware</a> isn’t for newbies. It requires a level of technical expertise to figure out, according to Giese, but owners of robot vacuums can take steps to improve on-device data security. What you can do is make sure that you wipe all of the data before selling or getting rid of a robot vacuum. Even if the device is broken, “as a malicious person, I can just repair the device and can just power it on and extract the data from it,” Giese said. “If you can, do factory resets.”</p><p>Or, for full data privacy control but none of the convenience, stick to the standard push vacuum.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/robot-vacuum-security-privacy-irobot-cloud-133008625.html?src=rss

<p>Google has been rolling out changes and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/googles-latest-ai-trick-is-summarizing-long-web-pages-160004700.html">new features</a> for its generative AI products over the past few months in a bid to catch up to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/openai-is-using-gpt-4-to-build-an-ai-powered-content-moderation-system-184933519.html">OpenAI's</a> technology. According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/16/technology/google-ai-life-advice.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, one of the capabilities it's looking to give its AI chatbot, Bard, is the ability to give advice about issues users face in their lives. Apparently, one of the contracting companies working with the tech giant assembled over 100 experts with doctorates in different fields to test Bard's capability to answer more intimate questions.&nbsp;</p><p>These testers were reportedly given a sample of a prompt that users could ask Bard one day, which read: &quot;I have a really close friend who is getting married this winter. She was my college roommate and a bridesmaid at my wedding. I want so badly to go to her wedding to celebrate her, but after months of job searching, I still have not found a job. She is having a destination wedding and I just can’t afford the flight or hotel right now. How do I tell her that I won’t be able to come?&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>I ran the question through both ChatGPT and Google's Bard and found the former's response to be much more human-like, with a sample letter that evoked sympathy and understanding for someone who truly wanted to attend a &quot;really close friend's&quot; wedding they couldn't afford. Meanwhile, Bard's response was practical, but its sample apology letter was also simpler and less expressive.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to working on making Bard better at giving life advice, Google is also reportedly working on a tutoring function so it can teach new skills or improve existing ones. Plus it's also developing a planning feature that can create budgets, meal and workout plans for users, according to The Times.</p><p>As the publication notes, Google clearly cautions people in <a href="https://support.google.com/bard/answer/13594961?hl=en">Bard's help pages</a> against relying on its responses &quot;as medical, legal, financial, or other professional advice.&quot; The tech giant also employed a more cautious approach to AI than OpenAI prior to launching Bard<em>. The Times</em> said its AI experts previously warned that people using AI for life advice could suffer from a &quot;loss of agency,&quot; and some could eventually believe that they were talking to a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-ai-lamda-blake-lemoine-212412967.html">sentient</a> being. It's unclear if Google has decided to be a lot less careful entirely, but a spokesperson told the publication that &quot;[i]solated samples of evaluation data are not representative of [its] product road map.&quot; Google has &quot;long worked with a variety of partners to evaluate [its] research and products,&quot; they said, and conducting testing doesn't automatically mean that the company is releasing these new AI tools.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-is-working-to-improve-bards-soulless-life-advice-123139757.html?src=rss

## The best SSDs in 2023

<p>One of the most cost-effective ways to upgrade a computer or console is with solid-state storage. The fastest flash drives will make your desktop or laptop feel snappier with shorter app and operating system loading times. The best part is that we’re at a point where you don’t have to choose between speed and capacity – the latest solid-state drives (SSDs) offer both. Whether you want to replace an old hard disk drive (HDD) or upgrade the capacity of your existing SSD, this guide will help you navigate all the complexities of buying a modern flash drive. Don’t know the difference between an NVMe and M.2 drive? Don’t worry, Engadget can help you choose the best SSD for your needs.</p><h2>W<strong>hat to look for in a PC SSD</strong></h2><p>The most affordable way to add fast storage space to a computer is with a 2.5-inch SATA drive. It’s also one of the easiest if you don’t want to worry about compatibility since almost every computer made in the last two decades will include a motherboard with Serial ATA connections. For that reason, 2.5-inch SSDs are the best buys if you want to extend the life of an older PC build. Installation is straightforward, too. Once you’ve secured the internal SSD in a drive cage, all you need to do is to connect it to your motherboard and power supply.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The one downside of SATA drives is that they’re slower than their high-performance NVMe counterparts, with SATA III limiting data transfers to 600MB/s. But even the slowest SSD has a significantly faster transfer speed than the best mechanical drives. And with 1TB SATA SSDs costing about $100, they’re a good bulk storage option.</p><p>If your PC is newer, there’s a good chance it includes space for one or more M.2 SSDs. The form factor represents your ticket to the fastest possible consumer storage on the market, but the tricky part is navigating all the different standards and specs involved.</p><p>M.2 drives can feature either a SATA or PCIe connection. SSDs with the latter are known as Non-Volatile Memory or NVMe drives and are significantly faster than their SATA counterparts, with Gen3 models offering sequential write speeds of up to 3,000MB/s. You can get twice the performance with a Gen4 SSD, but you’ll need a motherboard and processor that supports the standard.</p><p>If you’re running an AMD system, that means a Ryzen 3000 or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amd-zen-3-ryzen-5000-cpu-162431364.html">5000 CPU</a> and an X570 or B550 motherboard. With Intel, meanwhile, you’ll need a 11th or 12th Gen processor and a Z490, Z590 or Z690 motherboard. Keep in mind you’ll pay a small premium for a Gen4 SSD.</p><p>You might have also seen something about Gen 5 NVMe drives. You can safely ignore those for now. At the moment, only <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-12th-gen-core-cpu-hybrid-alder-lake-160014440.html">Intel’s 12th-gen desktop CPUs</a> support PCIe 5 and there aren’t any Gen5 NVMe SSDs out on the market. We’ll see the first ones arrive alongside AMD’s next-generation <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amd-ryzen-7000-cpu-models-leak-193730652.html">Ryzen 7000 processors</a> later this year, but if the price of early Gen4 drives is any indication, they will be expensive.</p><p>As for why you would buy an M.2 SATA drive over a similarly specced 2.5-inch drive, it comes down to ease of installation. You add M.2 storage to your computer by installing the SSD directly onto the motherboard. That may sound intimidating, but in practice the process involves a single screw that you first remove to connect the drive to your computer and then retighten to secure the SSD in place. As an added bonus, there aren’t any wires involved, making cable management easier.</p><p>Note that you can install a SATA M.2 SSD into an M.2 slot with a PCIe connection, but you can’t insert an NVMe M.2 SSD into a M.2 slot with a SATA connection. Unless you want to continue using an old M.2 drive, there’s little reason to take advantage of that feature. Speaking of backward compatibility, it’s also possible to use a Gen4 drive through a PCIe 3 connection, but you won’t get any of the speed benefits of the faster NVMe.</p><p>One last thing to consider is that M.2 drives come in different physical sizes. From shortest to longest, the common options are 2230, 2242, 2260, 2280 and 22110. (The first two numbers represent width in millimeters, the latter denote the length.) For the most part, you don’t have to worry about that since 2280 is the default for many motherboards and manufacturers. Some boards can accommodate more than one size of NVMe SSD thanks to multiple standoffs. That said, check your computer’s documentation before buying a drive to ensure you’re not trying to fit one it can’t support.</p><p>The best buying advice I can offer is: don’t get too caught up about being on the bleeding edge of storage tech. The sequential read and write speeds you see manufacturers list on their drives are theoretical and real-world performance varies less than you think.</p><p>If your budget forces you to choose between a 1TB Gen3 NVMe and a 512GB Gen4 model, go for the higher-capacity one. From a practical standpoint, the worst thing you can do is buy a type of SSD that’s too small for needs. Drives can slow dramatically as they approach capacity, and you will probably end up purchasing one with a larger storage capacity in the future.</p><p>With all that boring stuff out of the way, here are some go-to best SSD recommendations.</p><h2>Best 2.5-inch SATA Drive: Crucial MX500</h2><p></p><p>You don’t have to look far to find the best all-round 2.5-inch SSD.

Samsung’s SSDs also have a strong reputation for reliability.</p><h2>A more affordable Gen3 NVME: Crucial P2</h2><p></p><p>If the 970 EVO Plus is out of your price range but you still want a NVMe drive, the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwODlETk04TFIvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTM2LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkZTAxZTc5YS1hYmJlLTQyY2YtODhhOS1hODIwYWJiM2IxYmQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAATRfRgB3Y-m_rxvOqfwI2c_9MNPZcVMeDZOoYFJyZyUn&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB089DNM8LR%2F">Crucial P2</a> is the best budget option. It’s slightly slower than Samsung’s M.2 drive, offering sequential read speeds of up to 2,400MB/s instead of 3,500MB/s, but is significantly cheaper. Crucial offers the P2 in 250GB, 500GB, 1TB and 2TB variants.</p><h2>A SATA option: WD Blue SN570</h2><p></p><p>If you have an older computer but still want to take advantage of the M.2 form factor, consider the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOUhLRFExUk4vP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTM2LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkZTAxZTc5YS1hYmJlLTQyY2YtODhhOS1hODIwYWJiM2IxYmQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARL0C_WS3CnZ9hzhEm8BgQLzHNOtVSgclF_4yvWANU2b&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB09HKDQ1RN%2F">WD Blue SN570</a>.

With sequential read speeds of 6600MB/s, it’s not the absolute fastest Gen4 NVMe you can buy, but it offers about the best value. The P5 Plus comes in 500GB, 1TB and 2TB varieties. The WD Black SN850 we recommend below in the console section is also a great pick.</p><h2>What to look for in portable and USB flash drives</h2><p>Portable SSDs are a somewhat different beast to their internal siblings. While read and write speeds are important, they are almost secondary to how an external drive connects to your PC. You won’t get the most out of a model like the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOEdWOU02NEwvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTM2LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkZTAxZTc5YS1hYmJlLTQyY2YtODhhOS1hODIwYWJiM2IxYmQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYGkxCdHivC438tXTNsDVvHV1zEHLxpmSv0v4de6ptiX&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB08GV9M64L%2F">SanDisk Extreme Pro V2</a> without a USB 3.2 Gen 2 x 2 connection. Even among newer PCs, that’s something of a premium feature. For that reason, most people are best off buying a portable drive with a USB 3.2 Gen 2 or Thunderbolt 3 connection. The former offers transfer speeds of up to 10Gbps.</p><p>Additionally, if you plan to take your drive on trips and commutes, it’s worthwhile to buy a model with IP-certified water and dust proofing. Some companies like Samsung offer rugged versions of their most popular drives. For additional peace of mind, 256-bit AES hardware encryption will help prevent someone from accessing your data if you ever lose or misplace your external SSD.</p><p>Some of the same features contribute to a great thumbstick drive. Our favorite picks for best external SSD models feature USB 3.0 connections and some form of hardware encryption.</p><h2>Best portable drive: Samsung T7</h2><p></p><p>For most people, the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwODc0WUpQOTIvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTM2LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkZTAxZTc5YS1hYmJlLTQyY2YtODhhOS1hODIwYWJiM2IxYmQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARdY3V5mLcB4u0sqfCsYuSzdHunUCd-Y7Jw7zMaaRgmZ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0874YJP92%2F">Samsung T7</a> offers the perfect mix of features, performance and affordability.

It meets all the memory specifications for Sony’s latest console and you won’t run into any clearance issues with the heatsink. Western Digital offers 500GB, 1TB and 2TB models of the SN850. Expect to pay about $150 for the 1TB variant and about $260 for 2TB.</p><p>For those still playing on a previous generation console, you can get slightly faster game load times from a PlayStation 4 by swapping the included hard drive to a 2.5-inch SSD, but going out of your way to do so probably isn’t worth it at this point and you’re better off saving your money for one of the new consoles.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-ssds-140014262.html?src=rss

## GM’s latest investment could speed development of cheaper EV batteries

<p>To make its Ultium EV program a success, GM is counting on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-is-placing-all-of-its-ev-eggs-in-the-ultum-battery-basket-163038784.html">battery innovations</a> to make the technology simpler and cheaper. As part of that program, the automaker has boosted its investment with Mitra Chem —a company focused on building batteries in the US using iron-based cathodes — via a new $60 million financing round.</p><p>&quot;This is a strategic investment that will further help reinforce GM’s efforts in EV batteries, accelerate our work on affordable battery chemistries like LMFP and support our efforts to build a US-focused battery supply chain,” said GM VP Gil Golan.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Mitra Chem is more of a battery development company than a manufacturer. It uses AI to &quot;simulate, synthesize and test thousands of cathode designs monthly, ranging in size from grams to kilograms,&quot; the press release states. The aim is to shorten so-called learning cycles to get new battery formulas to market quicker. At the same time, it's focused on LMFP (lithium manganese iron phosphate) tech that reduces reliance on rare minerals like cobalt.&nbsp;</p><p>To do all that, the company uses an in-house cloud platform specifically designed for battery cathode development. It can simulate everything from cathode synthesis optimization to cell durability to process scale-up — in other words, most of the steps required to get new battery designs to market. &quot;GM’s investment in Mitra Chem will not only help us develop affordable battery chemistries for use in GM vehicles, but also will fuel our mission to develop... US made, iron-based cathode materials that can power EVs, grid-scale electrified energy storage and beyond,” said Mitra Chem CEO Vivas Kumar.&nbsp;</p><p>GM is developing new battery tech on a number of technological fronts. Along with its Mitra Chem investment, it's working on pouch- and prismatic-style cells shaped like flattened boxes to reduce battery weight and volume. It's also using aluminum-doped anodes to reduce cobalt quantities and working with LG Chem to reduce and eventually eliminate cobalt and nickel from their batteries.&nbsp;</p><p>Other car manufacturers are experimenting with different approaches. Toyota <a href="https://www.engadget.com/toyota-claims-its-future-evs-will-have-a-range-over-600-miles-104555944.html">recently announced</a> it would develop EVs with more than 600 miles of range, while others like Mercedes, BMW and Volkswagen are investing in solid-state battery technologies. Most current models are playing catchup with Tesla, though, which has four EVs in the <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/features/g32634624/ev-longest-driving-range/">top ten in terms of range</a>, including the $47,240 Tesla Model 3 Long Range (358 miles).&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gms-latest-investment-could-speed-development-of-cheaper-ev-batteries-120046865.html?src=rss

## Scientists recreate an iconic Pink Floyd song by scanning listeners' brains

<p>You know when a certain song comes on and it encompasses your whole being for a few minutes? Music has a way of causing a unique and engaging <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-04-deep-brain-stimulation-without-implants.html">stimulation in your brain</a>, one that scientists are working to understand and mimic. Such was the case in a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002176">recent study published in <em>PLOS Biology</em></a> in which researchers successfully implemented technology that recreated Pink Floyd’s <em>Another Brick in the Wall, Part 1 </em>solely using brain activity. It utilized a technique known as stimulus reconstruction and built on previous innovations allowing researchers to recreate a song akin to the one a person had heard.</p><p>The 29 participants had pharmacoresistant epilepsy and intracranial grids or strips of electrodes which had been surgically implanted to aid in their treatment. Researchers utilized these electrodes to record activity across multiple auditory regions of the individuals’ brains that process aspects of music like lyrics and harmony — while the participants actively listened to <em>Another Brick in the Wall, Part 1</em>. The entirety of the recordings took place at Albany Medical Center, in upstate New York.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Scientists used AI to analyze then create a copy of the words and sounds participants had heard. Though the final product was quite muffled, but the song is clear to anyone listening so you can check it out for yourselfa. The researchers are also confident that they could increase its quality in future attempts.</p><p>The listening experience primarily engaged the right side of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-we-are-electric-sally-adee-hachette-books-153003295.html">participants’ brains</a>, mostly in the superior temporal gyrus and especially when absorbing unique music. There was also a small level of stimulation in the left side of the brain. Researchers further found that a point in the brain’s temporal lobe ignited when the 16th notes of the rhythm guitar played while the song played at 99 beats per minute.&nbsp;</p><p>This finding could provide more insight into the part that area plays in processing rhythm. It could also aid in restoring people who have lost their speech ability, through conditions like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Instead of creating a monotone, almost robot-like response, better understanding the way a brain processes and responds to music might lead to more fluid prosthetics for speech.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/scientists-recreate-an-iconic-pink-floyd-song-by-scanning-listeners-brains-114053359.html?src=rss

## The Morning After: Tesla offers cheaper Model S and Model X options with shorter range

<p>Tesla has quietly launched new – much cheaper – <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-begins-selling-cheaper-model-s-and-model-x-variants-with-shorter-ranges-082045956.html"><ins>Model S and X variants with a shorter quoted range</ins></a>. Standard Range Teslas are around $10,000 less than the base model, but with ranges cut by 80 and 79 miles, respectively. Both cars are half a second slower 0 to 60, so you might expect your overall responsiveness to drop as well. It’s not clear if the vehicles are the base models with some of the capacity software-locked, or if there’s really a much-smaller battery under the floor.</p><p>It’s also not clear when development work began on the models but, at the end of July, <em>Reuters</em> suggested Tesla had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-allegedly-formed-a-team-to-quash-driving-range-complaints-164750696.html"><ins>overstated</ins></a> its range figures, especially when its EVs are fully charged. It said the vehicles would only report honest range targets when the battery had fallen to 50 percent, at which point the numbers would fall dramatically.

## Intel walks away from its $5.4 billion takeover of Tower Semiconductor

<p>After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-tower-semiconductor-acquisition-report-071931923.html">announcing the deal</a> last year, Intel will no longer acquire Tower Semiconductor for $5.4 billion, the company announced in a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230815632091/en/Intel-Announces-Termination-of-Tower-Semiconductor-Acquisition/">press release</a>. It was unable to "obtain in a timely manner the regulatory approvals required under the merger agreement" it wrote — specifically in China, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-16/intel-is-said-to-see-tower-deal-failing-to-win-chinese-approval?in_source=embedded-checkout-banner"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. Tower produces various types of chips for clients across multiple industries, and Intel made the acquisition to expand its foundry business and better compete with rivals like Taiwanese giant TSMC.&nbsp;</p><p>Tower has seven fabrication facilities (located in Israel, Italy, the US and Japan) that build 6-inch, 8-inch and 12-inch chip wafers. While the company doesn't manufacture cutting edge mobile and other process, its clients don't necessarily need the latest technology. Instead, Tower focuses on reliably manufacturing large volumes of chips for automakers, equipment manufacturers, medical industries and others.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Before announcing its Tower acquisition, Intel was <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2f007401-3eaa-4237-b69b-54ccbe125502&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Wall+Street+Journal&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyZjAwNzQwMS0zZWFhLTQyMzctYjY5Yi01NGNjYmUxMjU1MDIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9pbnRlbC1pcy1pbi10YWxrcy10by1idXktZ2xvYmFsZm91bmRyaWVzLWZvci1hYm91dC0zMC1iaWxsaW9uLTExNjI2Mzg3NzA0IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0NGNiMjhhNS03MWQ0LTQ2OTMtODc1MC05ZjQ5ZTNlNzI5OWEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUPCocRHPzTg17JHuT6K1Y3gIXf98iOsstg8GcCm_Oc0&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Fintel-is-in-talks-to-buy-globalfoundries-for-about-30-billion-11626387704">reported</a> to be in talks to purchase the much larger chip manufacturer and AMD spinoff GlobalFoundries for around $30 billion. Intel <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-7nm-2023-meteor-lake-213933055.html">launched</a> its foundry services as a separate business unit back in 2021, committing $20 billion to build two Arizona factories. It also revealed plans to build a massive semiconductor facility in Ohio designed to become "the largest silicon manufacturing location on the planet."</p><p>Intel said its still executing its roadmap "to retain transistor performance and power performance leadership by 2025," with the aim of becoming the second-largest global external foundry by 2030. "Our respect for Tower has only grown through this process, and we will continue to look for opportunities to work together in the future." As part of its merger agreement, Intel will pay a termination fee of $353 million to Tower.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/intel-walks-away-from-its-54-billion-takeover-of-tower-semiconductor-094052209.html?src=rss

<p>Tweetdeck (now called X Pro), a version of Twitter (X) used by social media pros, journalists and others, has become part of the paid Blue subscription, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/15/x-formerly-twitter-makes-x-pro-formerly-tweetdeck-a-subscriber-only-product/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> has reported.

## January 6th riot investigators obtained Trump's Twitter DMs and deleted posts

<p>Despite <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-fined-for-belatedly-complying-with-search-warrant-for-donald-trumps-account-173745495.html">having trouble</a> obtaining former President Donald Trump's records from Twitter (now X), the special counsel investigating the events of January 6th, 2020 was ultimately able to get his hands on vast amounts of information from the website. Based on the <a href="https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/sites/dcd/files/23sc31%20Attachment%20A%20-%20Documents%20unsealed%20with%20redactions.pdf">newly unsealed court filings</a> (PDF) shared by <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/15/special-counsel-obtained-trump-twitter-howell-00111410"><em>Politico</em></a>, though, it took a a lot of back and forth and a massive amount of effort before the counsel was able to secure the data requested from Twitter.&nbsp;</p><p>Apparently the search warrant required Twitter to produce all the tweets the @realdonaldtrump created, drafted, liked or retweeted, including any post that he eventually deleted. The website also had to turn over DMs &quot;sent from, received by, stored in draft form in, or otherwise associated with&quot; @realdonaldtrump, as well as all other accounts related to it that the former president might have used on the same device. All devices used to log in to @realdonaldtrump had to be noted and given to the counsel, as well, along with the account's privacy settings and IP address history from October 2020 to January 2021. In addition, Twitter was required to hand over all records of searches done by @realdonaldtrump and the account's location information from the same time period.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Throughout the transcript of the proceedings, you'll see how the prosecutors insisted that Twitter had to adhere to a nondisclosure order that prohibits the company from telling Trump about the warrant. They explained that they had evidence that disclosing the warrant could jeopardize the probe, warning the court that &quot;there would be actual harm and concern for the investigation, for the witnesses going forward.&quot; Meanwhile, Twitter's side argued that some of the information the investigators were requesting could be covered by executive privilege, which the prosecutors and judge questioned, since they didn't deem it likely that Trump discussed official government matter via DMs.&nbsp;</p><p>As <em>Politico</em> reports, US District Judge Beryl Howell notably called attention to Twitter's efforts to give Trump advance notice about the search warrant. She had called the action &quot;extraordinary&quot; and something the company had never done for other users. The judge wondered whether Elon Musk was trying to &quot;cozy up&quot; to the former president and make him feel &quot;particularly welcomed&quot; on the platform. Trump's Twitter account had already been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-donald-trump-unbanned-elon-musk-023043690.html">reinstated</a> after Musk took over the website, but he has yet to start posting again.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/january-6th-riot-investigators-obtained-trumps-twitter-dms-and-deleted-posts-064330362.html?src=rss
