This new information comes from a developer Q&amp;A hosted on Discord (via <a href=\"https://www.resetera.com/threads/starfield-discord-q-a-with-emil-and-will-recap-16-questions-answered.753817/\">ResetEra</a>) with lead game designer Emil Pagliarulo and lead quest designer Will Shen.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The first piece of information revealed is that players can buy homes in all majority cities in Starfield and there are even a few homes rewarded for completing quests. For anyone who takes on the Kids Stuff trait--which involves your parents being present in the game--the parents' faces and models will be determined by your own created character.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">For players looking to smuggle contraband through space, there are spaceship parts and modules that can be used to conceal contraband from security ships outside major planets. While goods, including illegal ones, have a set price in the universe, there are skills and traits you can acquire to sell items for more than they are worth. Any potential criminals can be forced to pay a fine or go to jail if they are caught breaking laws, although you always have the option to go on the run.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-lets-you-buy-property-and-go-to-jail/1100-6516947/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-lets-you-buy-property-and-go-to-jail/1100-6516947/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-08-16T23:05:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Minecraft Legends' Biggest Update To Date Finally Lets You Pet Animals", "description": "<p> </p><p>Mojangs biggest update yet for <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft-legends/\">Minecraft Legends</a> improves PvP communication, introduces lobby roles, new experimental modes, and more.</p><p> </p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-legends-biggest-update-to-date-finally-lets-you-pet-animals/1100-6516946/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-legends-biggest-update-to-date-finally-lets-you-pet-animals/1100-6516946/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-08-16T22:57:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Baldur's Gate 3 Hotfix 4 Fixes Sleepy Companions", "description": "<p><em>Update: </em>Larian Studios has rolled back Hotfix 4 temporarily as the new build is causing crashes.

And, in <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/\">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, you can make use of their spectacular abilities to get past tricky situations or to give yourself an advantage in battle. Our guide discusses the Baldur's Gate 3 Minor Illusion and Wild Shape Cat, two spells that ensure you'll have a meow-velous time in Faerun. These cat-based abilities have been a bit overshadowed in the Baldur's gate 3 community so far, but as you'll see below, players are starting to better appreciate how helpful cats can be in the world of Baldur's Gate.</p><h2>How to use Minor Illusion and Wild Shape Cat in Baldur's Gate 3</h2><p>The Baldur's Gate 3 Minor Illusion spell is available to most spellcasting classes, such as the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-bard-class-guide/1100-6516598/\"><strong>Bard</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-sorcerer-class-guide/1100-6516728/\"><strong>Sorcerer</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-warlock-class-guide/1100-6516623/\"><strong>Warlock</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-wizard-class-guide/1100-6516608/\"><strong>Wizard</strong></a>. It can also be used by certain subclasses, like the Eldritch Knight <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-fighter-class-guide/1100-6516725/\"><strong>Fighter</strong></a> and the Way of Shadow <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-monk-class-guide/1100-6516430/\"><strong>Monk</strong></a>. Wild Shape Cat, meanwhile, is available to <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-druid-class-guide/1100-6516610/\"><strong>Druid</strong></a> players.</p><h3>How to use Minor Illusion</h3><p>Minor Illusion spawns a magical cat, which disappears after 10 turns (or roughly 10 seconds). Since it's a cantrip, it can be cast repeatedly without expending spell slots (that means you won't need to do a long rest). It's also fairly underutilized, but is extremely powerful in the right situations, as noted by Twitter user <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Papapishu/status/1691696908362760650\">@Papapishu</a>.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-cat-spells-wildshape-guide/1100-6516929/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-cat-spells-wildshape-guide/1100-6516929/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-08-16T20:01:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 Vault Edition, Preorder Bonuses Leak", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Data miners uncovered and leaked details on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3's release versions and preorder order bonuses ahead of the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-reveal-event-rewards-announced-for-warzone/1100-6516900/\">Modern Warfare 3 reveal stream planned for tomorrow, August 17.</a> While it's wise to take any leaks with a grain of salt, based on the quality of the information and the proximity to the reveal, we have a strong degree of confidence in these preorder details.

Over the centuries, the game has certainly evolved, but at the end of the day, the mechanics and gameplay remain largely the same. You hit metal balls around the playfield, bouncing them off of scoring pins and launching them through chutes, in an attempt to reign supreme with the high score. However, leading pinball machine maker Stern is looking to take the game to a new level with its latest title, Marvel's Venom.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The pinball machine, based on the Marvel comics foe, was announced at San Diego Comic-Con, and it plays quite a bit differently than what the average pinball fan expects. With Venom, which includes all the normal pinball bells and whistles, there's more of a goal than landing on the high-score list or winning a free game. Instead, it's a pinball machine with game progression, bosses to beat, a save mechanic, and even unlockable player characters to add more replayability.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The heavy lifting for these features is done by the Stern Pinball app. In it, users can sign up for an <a href=\"https://sternpinball.com/2021/08/26/stern-pinball-launches-insider-connected-platform/\">Insider Connected account</a>, which can then be synced to modern Stern machines via a QR code scanner in the machine.

Shazam 2 and The Flash were bad movies that both flopped. And now we've got Blue Beetle, a film that has the look and feel of a big Arrowverse crossover event on The CW. I'm sorry to say the state of DC hasn't improved at all with this movie.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Blue Beetle follows recent college grad Jaime Reyes (Xolo Mariduena) as he tries to help his family keep their house. Instead, he runs afoul of Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon), the evil billionaire running a tech company called Kord Industries, and gets himself and his sister fired from their cleaning job. But then Jaime gets mixed up with Victoria's niece, Jenny (Bruna Marquezine), who doesn't love that Aunt Vicki turned the company into an arms manufacturer. And after a series of accidents and coincidences, Jaime ends up with an ancient alien device climbing up his butt and turning him into a superhero. And Victoria is going to send some armored super soldiers to get that Scarab back.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Blue Beetle has three really big problems. First: It was originally planned to be released directly to HBO Max, and the final product feels shows it. It looks cheap and bland, the cinematography makes use of only the most standard TV angles and framing, and the action sequences never look like much. Blue Beetle has the air of a broadcast TV show like The CW's Arrow or The Flash, rather than the introductory chapter of a DC hero on the big screen.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/blue-beetle-review-spared-lots-of-expense/1900-6418104/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/blue-beetle-review-spared-lots-of-expense/1900-6418104/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-08-16T17:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 Campaign Is Playable 7 Days Early If You Preorder", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii/\">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III</a>'s campaign will seemingly be playable a week early, but only if you preorder.

But science fiction as a genre is vast and diverse, ranging from adventure to horror, approachable to heady.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Frank Herbert's Dune is one of the most popular science-fiction novels of all time, but it's also on the brainier side. The book throws tons of political and ecological information at you and asks you to imagine humanity 10,000 years into the future when computers are outlawed and intergalactic space travel is made possible by creatively overdosing on the universe's most popular drug. It's also a story about a young man unwittingly conditioned and trained to be not just a leader of men, but <em>the</em> leader of men, and it tries to criticize the idea of a messiah and of genetic tampering.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Dune has also proven difficult to film, with David Lynch's 1984 version leaving many people cold thanks to its heavy divergences from the original story, and Syfy's made-for-TV movie version looking pretty cheap even when it originally aired in 2000. Director Denis Villeneuve's talent for epic visuals, proven in projects like Blade Runner 2049 and Arrival, brought Dune to life with a fidelity that fans of the books never thought possible. It's not perfect, but it gets a lot closer to the source material than we'd expected. 2020's Dune covers roughly the first half of the book, though, and the upcoming Dune: Part Two is set to finish the first novel this November 3.</p><p>With Hollywood's writers and actors striking for fair pay and contracts that ensure they won't be replaced by computers, though, studios may be looking to stretch out what movies they have ready while they try to avoid doing just that, and Dune: Part Two might become a 2024 movie. And thus, the cerebral science fiction you were promised could be pushed frustratingly out of reach. So what's a sci-fi fan to do? This is our list of weird, atmospheric movies that fall <em>somewhere</em> under the umbrella of science fiction, even if only partly. And we're just going to say it now: Virtually every movie on this list struggles with pacing. There are a lot of slow movies on this list, but they're all gorgeous and fascinating. Here they are, in no particular order.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>10. Blade Runner 2049 (2017)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4179071-blade-runner-2049.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Blade Runner 2049 <em>should</em> suck. It's a sequel made decades later to a classic sci-fi film that didn't need further expansion. Blade Runner stands well on its own. But Denis Villeneuve found a way to both revisit Blade Runner and make it his own thing. Villeneuve excels in creating vast, lonely spaces with expansive soundscapes. As Officer K searches for Rick Deckard and clues about his own identity, we visit parts of Blade Runner previously unseen, like the deserted Las Vegas, covered in powdery, red dust bowl sand. It seeks to ask more questions of the future world about where identity and memory come from, and what it means to have manufactured memories as all of the film's Replicants do.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>9. Under the Skin (2013)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4179074-under-the-skin.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">In Under the Skin, Scarlett Johansson plays the part of an unnamed woman who roams the cities of Scotland looking for lonely men to take back home. When they enter her space, though, they find themselves walking into an inky void that consumes them. This is a movie about an alien's perspective on human relationships and the human body, and how strange and scary they can both be. Johansson excels at making her sexuality awkward, robotic, and off-putting as she preys on men. Later, that turns back on her as she begins to become curious about the very humans she's victimized. The movie is quiet, isn't afraid to leave things unexplained, and it will leave you with lots of questions and little comfort when the credits roll.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>8. Dune (1984)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4179072-dune-1983.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">David Lynch's Dune is a divisive movie, as discussed above. It's not a bad movie, just a really weird one. Lynch was given a huge (at the time) $45 million budget to work with. Compared to his previous works, Eraserhead and Elephant Man, that was astronomical. Dune has always seemed ambitious, and Lynch did his best to make sense of the story within an acceptable runtime. That required some shortcuts that fans of the book find weird and, often, downright unacceptable. For example, the idea of the Bene Gesserit \"voice,\" a sort of hypnotic command used in the story, was turned into a physical weapon that the Fremen would use against the Harkonnen. Yeah, that part isn't great. But the movie also features some of the richest, most lavish set design in all of moviemaking. Nothing else out there looks like this version of Dune. From the opening shots on Paul Atreides' home planet of Caladan and the ultra-industrial Geidi Prime to the designs of Spice Harvesters and the look of the Guild navigators, everything about Lynch's Dune screams imagination. Even if you can't take the story entirely seriously, this movie is worth watching just for the visual feast of practical set design and visual effects it offers.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Also, you should probably watch Denis Villeneuve's Dune before you see Dune: Part Two. Just saying.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. A Scanner Darkly (2006)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4179068-a-scanner-darkly.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Philip K. Dick's A Scanner Darkly is one of his darkest stories, presenting a near-future world where drug addiction is endemic. Police use identity-masking technology to infiltrate groups to study users and find their sources. The story deals with themes of drug addiction and paranoia and uses rotoscoped animation--animation made using filmed live-action footage (other examples include Prime Video's Undone, Waking Life, Ralph Bakshi's Wizards, and many older Disney animated movies)--to create a strange, dreamlike world. Characters wearing the identity-masking technology shift and blink as the technology changes different parts of their faces and bodies in turn. The film is deceptively bright and beautiful, masking a lonely, scary tale as protagonist Bob (Keanu Reeves) becomes addicted to the very drug he was meant to root out and begins to lose himself. It can be a tough watch, but it's also one of the more faithful Philip K. Dick adaptations out there.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. Primer (2004)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4179073-primer-movie.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">\"Are you hungry? I haven't eaten since later this afternoon.\" That's the line where Primer will either catch you or miss you. There are three major types of time-travel movie. The first is fun--Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure and Back to the Future use time travel to facilitate goofy adventures. Action flicks like Edge of Tomorrow would land here as well. The second is drama--Somewhere in Time and It's About Time are more interested in telling a touching or tragic story than exploring the implications of time travel. Primer, though, is an example of the third type: the mind-bender. After watching Primer for the first time, you'll think that someone cracked the science of time travel and made a documentary about it. At 77 minutes, this movie is a quick watch, but that doesn't mean it's an easy one.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Writer-director-composer-lead actor Shane Carruth is a mathematician and engineer and wrote the script for this with all the technical language intact, making it easy to get lost in the conversations. Filmed for just $7,000, Primer is a true indie film and one that wants to explore the weirdness and mundanity of time travel. Things are fun and exciting at first, but they don't stay that way.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4179066-2001aso.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">2001 is so well-ingrained into popular culture that whether you've seen it or not, you know the ways other popular culture references it. In the distant future--the year 2000--astronauts find a towering black monolith buried on the moon. Built in a perfect 1:4:9 ratio and using materials unknown to man, this is the first sign of alien life. Eighteen months later, the United States has launched a mission to Jupiter to find out what the Monolith was signaling. What begins as space exploration becomes a dangerous fight against a conflicted artificial intelligence named Hal 9000, and then becomes a metaphysical exploration of the origins of man and intelligence. The movie is lauded for its authentic depiction of space despite the fact that it was released in 1968, before our first moon mission. Make no mistake, 2001 is a <em>slow</em> movie. But 55 years later, it's still a stunning film that has relevant ideas about artificial intelligence and consciousness.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. Blade Runner (1982)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4179070-blade-runner-1982.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">You knew Blade Runner would end up on this list. It's tough to recommend because there are so many different versions of Blade Runner and they <em>all</em> have problems. Blade Runner: The Final Cut is probably the closest to a full encapsulation of Ridley Scott's original vision for the movie. Another Philip K. Dick adaptation, Blade Runner strays further from its source material than A Scanner Darkly. But just like Lynch did with Dune, it established a visual language that in turn influenced how many readers imagine the book. It set an early precedent for the look of cyberpunk media that continues to inform new projects in the cyberpunk genre, from Cyberpunk 2077 to Johnny Mnemonic to Ghost in the Shell. You could watch it on mute and it would still be an incredibly rich experience.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. Beyond the Black Rainbow (2010)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4179069-beyondtheblackrainbow.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Described by its director, Panos Cosmatos, as a \"trance film,\" Beyond the Black Rainbow is a strange and meandering sci-fi horror movie. Set in the 1980s, it follows a young woman named Elena, who seemingly has psychic powers, and who is imprisoned in a place called the Arboria Institute. The movie is tense but full of gorgeous shots that bathe the screen in color. It also has an awesome synth soundtrack provided by Jeremy Schmidt of Black Mountain that amplifies the film's ominous atmosphere.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. Upstream Color (2013)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4179075-upstream-color.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Trying to explain the plot of Upstream Color is tough. Directed by Primer's Shane Carruth, the movie explores ideas about breaking cycles and the culpability of someone taking part in an exploitative ecosystem. Protagonist Kris (Amy Seimetz) is forced to swallow a larva that has strange effects on the human mind. She's kept in a hypnotic state by her captor and gives up all of her personal effects before she's released. Later, she meets someone with similar scars, and the two begin to experience unexplained empathetic responses to pigs on a farm. The responses lead them to the farm and clues about what happened to them. Like Carruth's other work, Upstream Color is short, clocking in at only 96 minutes.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. Annihilation (2018)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4179067-annihilation-film.jpeg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">One problem that often plagues science fiction is how heavily it depends on known tropes--it promises an alien world but gives us one full of bipedal creatures with two eyes, who let us know whether they're friendly or not by firing (or not firing) a gun of some kind. But what if that alien life was unrecognizable from what we view as life? What if it was hostile in its very existence, not because of a conscious decision to attack? Annihilation, based on the 2014 book of the same name by Jeff VanderMeer, is one of the few science-fiction movies that feels like it's presenting something truly alien. The world around the protagonists often makes no sense to them until it's too late for them to do anything about it. The life beyond the Shimmer in Annhilation is vibrant, colorful, and sometimes incomprehensible, and it makes for a visually rich and narratively strange experience.</p></h3></p><br />", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/10-super-intense-sci-fi-movies-to-watch-while-you-prepare-for-dune-part-two/2900-4835/", "date_published": "2023-08-16T14:13:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Baldur's Gate 3 Speedrunners Turn Their Attention To Getting Laid Fast", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/\">Baldur's Gate 3</a> is a monumentally broad and detailed game that should take most players numerous hours to complete. We've already seen just how quickly you can beat it with the current fastest completion time at just under 10 minutes, but with a game packed with all the varied content that Baldur's Gate 3 has to offer, racing to the credits seems a little boring.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">That could be why challenging yourself to see how fast you can get your character laid is now a new fun speedrunner challenge (via <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-speedrunners-are-now-rushing-to-have-sex\">IGN</a>), which has now become <a href=\"https://www.speedrun.com/baldurs_gate_3?h=sex&amp;x=7dgemg72\">official in the Sex% category </a>for the game's speedrunning community. The current record sits at just below eight minutes, with runner Mae (who also managed to beat the game in a hair over 10 minutes) achieving the feat but utilizing some clutch mage skills and the steely determination to get to bed in the evening as quickly as possible.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The run, which you <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-Rkgdcj5Ds\">can see here</a>, shows Mae guiding their level one human wizard through the game's prologue and avoiding as much combat as possible, making intelligent use of Enhanced Leap to get around skirmishes and keep pushing for glory. Said glory is an introduction to Lae'zel, which happens near the end of the run and during the only forced combat scenario. Mae uses this to their advantage too, tricking one of the tieflings in the Grove to bow down to Lae'zel. This is enough to convince Lae'zel to invite Mae's wizard over for a different kind of skirmish at night, which Mae quickly initiates once getting back to camp.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-speedrunners-turn-their-attention-to-getting-laid-fast/1100-6516916/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-speedrunners-turn-their-attention-to-getting-laid-fast/1100-6516916/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-08-16T14:12:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Cross-Play Games Might Soon Become Even More Common", "description": "<p>Epic Games, which was one of the first companies behind the effort to push for cross-play across consoles, is now going further and launching its cross-play overlay for Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch.

The franchise went on to become single-mindedly obsessed with its breakout star, Captain Jack Sparrow, but the first movie was an agile, lightly spooky swashbuckling adventure. Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew shares that movie's spirit of goofy haunted slapstick with a heart and real dramatic stakes, and blends it with an expertly crafted stealth-strategy campaign. It all comes together into one of my favorite games of the year.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Shadow Gambit centers around the Red Marley, a living, talking ghost ship with an undead crew who have fallen to the Inquisition of the Burning Maiden. You play primarily as Afia, as she revives the cursed compatriots one by one and gathers information on the hidden treasure of the Red Marley's captain, Captain Mordechai, who is conspicuously absent. The search for Mordechai's treasure is an intriguing hook that propels the plot forward and balances well against the often eccentric subplots of the individual characters.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The crew is distinctly drawn with one-of-a-kind visual attributes and backgrounds that makes discovering each team member a joy. Afia is permanently seen with a spectral sword sticking out of her chest, which she draws to eliminate enemies. Suleidy looks as if she's been partially consumed by plant-life. Pinkus is a fancy lad in a powdered wig, while Quintin the treasurer carries around his own golden skull. For a game about the undead, the personalities are just crackling with life and personality.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/shadow-gambit-the-cursed-crew-review-spectacul-arrrr/1900-6418103/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/shadow-gambit-the-cursed-crew-review-spectacul-arrrr/1900-6418103/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-08-16T13:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Free Destiny 2 Eververse Armor Coming In Season 22, As Bungie Explains Changes", "description": "<p>Following a state of the game update that didn't go over well a few weeks ago, Destiny 2 players had some harsh criticism for developer Bungie on a number of topics.
