Blue Beetle reviewed by Alyssa Mora.

Under Ángel Manuel Soto’s direction, Blue Beetle is a superhero movie that sets itself apart within the bloated genre through the deeply connected bonds of Jaime Reyes and his family. Xolo Maridueña is wonderfully cast, able to convey Jaime’s reluctance toward superhero-dom and the fierce protectiveness he feels for his family and community. His Mexican-American identity isn’t just set-dressing, it’s vital to the character and the plot of the film. Though genre cliches and the villain’s relatively uninteresting motivation impede the momentum of the third act, the emotional force behind the movie is enough to make it worth a watch.

Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew reivewed by Jon Bolding on PC. Also available on Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5.

Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew is a peak example of the stealth tactics genre from a studio that is clearly mastering its craft. Its mission structure is spread across excellently entertaining levels with rich detail to find and master, while characters shine with voice performances, endearing humor, and colorful art that both delight and impress. With innumerable ways to approach its levels and an extremely smart integration of the practice of saving and reloading into the world’s fiction, it’s firing on all cylinders in all categories except perhaps enemy AI. Frankly, I don't know anyone I wouldn't recommend it to.

WrestleQuest reviewed by Jarrett Green on PC. Also available on Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch.
WrestleQuest is truly an earnest attempt at telling an authentic wrestling tale in old-school RPG format. Competent combat mechanics add flair and depth to a usually pretty banal aspect of this style of game, but much of the depth feels easy to ignore, and the parts that aren't – namely dramatic moments – supply the opposite of a fun challenge. Likewise, it may take a bit of fighting spirit to make it through the slow and arduous dungeons and some of the bloated and jarring plot, yet it captures the intrepid lives of people who travel the world, beating each other up for fame and fortune in charming and touching ways that are enhanced by its Toy Story-style innocence. For being the first attempt at telling a pro wrestling tale in such a story-forward medium, WrestleQuest is championship material – but maybe just a mid-card title.
