## Nvidia's DLSS 3.5 Tackles Ray-Tracing Quality And Is Available To All RTX Cards

<p>Nvidia has announced a big update to its suite of DLSS (Deep-Learning Super Sampling) features, this time taking aim at improving the visual reconstruction of ray-traced effects in supported titles.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the biggest issues with image reconstruction currently when applied to ray-traced effects is the amount of noise that is introduced as a side effect, removing some of the sheen from the otherwise eye-catching effects. Nvidia is planning to use AI-trained denoisers to replace the current hand-tuned ones to clean up reconstruction noise more effectively, improving game performance while also preserving more of the original image.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">Nvidia says it has trained its DLSS 3.5 Ray Reconstruction model on five times as much data as the base DLSS 3 suite, which should hopefully produce some fine results. Thankfully you won't have to wait too long to sample it either, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cyberpunk-2077/">Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/alan-wake-ii/">Alan Wake 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/portal-with-rtx-adds-ray-tracing-and-4k-textures-to-valves-classic-puzzle-game/1100-6507707/">Portal RTX</a> all supporting DLSS 3.5.

<p>New gameplay footage for Stormgate has been revealed at Gamescom Opening Night Live, showing off the game's second playable faction in action. A real-time strategy game inspired by classic Blizzard RTS titles, Stormgate blends sci-fi with fantasy as it pits the technologically advanced armies of the Human Vanguard against the demonic hordes of the Infernal Host.</p><p>What the Infernal Host lacks in high-tech weapons it makes up for with magical might, zone control that buffs units, and a kamikaze approach to battle that floods the battlefield with cannon-fodder troops. The armies of the Infernal Host can take advantage of Shroud, a field of magical energy produced by key Infernal structures, allowing for powerful Rituals to be cast and providing significant advantages to any Infernal units within its range of influence.</p><p>Three of the units that can be sent into battle include the worker Imp, the Fiend, and the Brute. Imps are primarily tasked with gathering resources, but they can also set themselves ablaze to trigger a powerful <em>Imp-losion</em>. Brutes are two-headed ogres that can absorb a significant amount of damage, and when the time is right, sacrifice themselves by unleashing a pair of fast-striking Fiends.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starcraft-love-letter-stormgate-gets-new-trailer-with-second-playable-faction/1100-6517052/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/spintires-mudrunner/">MudRunner</a>, the popular driving simulation game, is getting a surprising spin-off that puts a greater emphasis on exploration and upgrades. Expeditions: A MudRunner Game is being developed by Saber Interactive, with a reveal announcement at Gamescom 2023.</p><p dir="ltr">Developed by the same team behind both <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/snowrunner/">SnowRunner</a> and MudRunner, Expeditions builds on the foundations of the simulation driving in both games and expands it with open-world, resource-hunting objectives that let you improve and build upon your vehicular abilities. The gameplay trailer shows you using drones to scout out terrain, identify resources, and then chart routes to retrieve them, before using what you've gathered to improve your loadouts and take on more challenging routes.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">Expeditions also looks like it will challenge your ability to adapt to new off-road terrains, with different areas offering their own distinct challenges. Steep cliffs might require the use of careful clutch control in conjunction with a cable and wench, while frozen lakes will test your ability to traverse them with a more delicate touch. The breadth of tools available to you to tackle these terrains looks central to Expeditions main loop, setting it apart from previous games in the growing series.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mudrunner-gets-exploration-focused-spin-off-expeditions/1100-6517089/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

The trailer features a look at the near-future city of New Eridu, where characters can hang out and play arcade games.</p><p>Not too much is shown of the different activities you can do in New Eridu, but players were shown having the option to hang out with different named characters, including a wolf-man in a fancy suit. </p><div>          </div><p>The trailer also shows a ton of different playable characters in combat, which shows what separates Zenless Zone Zero for the other games made by the same studio.

<p>Gamescom Opening Night Live was briefly interrupted by a stage crasher, in an incident remarkably similar to the one at The Game Awards in December.</p><p>The incident occurred just after a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/impressive-live-action-starfield-trailer-invites-you-to-the-cosmos/1100-6517077/">new trailer debuted for Starfield</a>, as host Geoff Keighley prepared to introduce Todd Howard to talk more about the upcoming space-faring RPG. The stage crasher was quickly escorted away, after attempting to shout something into Keighley's microphone.</p><p>The moment recalled one at The Game Awards when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/random-kid-arrested-after-appearing-on-stage-at-the-game-awards/1100-6509914/">someone took the stage</a> during the acceptance speech for Elden Ring's Game of the Year award.

<p>As part of Gamescom's Opening Night Live event, Bethesda and Microsoft released a live-action trailer for Starfield--and it's pretty impressive.</p><p>The video, set to a rendition of Elton John's "Rocket Man," shows an astronaut blasting off into space, zipping around in a space ship, landing on a mysterious planet, and adventuring through an strange alien world. It definitely captures what seems to be the essence of the game, which is that you can go anywhere and do anything in a vast open world.

<p> </p><p dir="ltr">Paramount+ has unveiled the first teaser for Good Burger 2, the sequel to the 1997 cult classic Nickelodeon film Good Burger. Slated for release on Paramount+ this fall, the sequel follows Dexter Reed (Kenan Thompson) and Ed (Kel Mitchell) as they reunite in the present day at the fast-food joint, Good Burger, with a new group of employees.</p><p dir="ltr">If those plot details sound a bit light, that's because that's pretty much all this new teaser reveals about the movie. The teaser shows Ed hitting Dexter with a burger-shaped car and features the iconic "I'm a dude, you're a dude, he's a dude, we're all dudes" song. The boys are back, and the burgers are good. What more do you really need to know about a Good Burger 2 other than it's actually happening, anyway?</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/good-burger-2-teaser-drops-the-burgers-are-still-good/1100-6517064/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Former Xbox Exec Says Millions Were Spent To Get Games Parity With PS2

<p dir="ltr">It wasn't cheap for Microsoft to carve out space in the gaming industry in the 2000s. Peter Moore, an Xbox executive from 2003-07, recently explained that the company spent millions of dollars just to get third-party games day and date with Sony's systems on Xbox and Xbox 360.</p><p dir="ltr">Appearing on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGOBd3h1CQ0">Iron Lords Podcast</a> (spotted by <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterOvo5/status/1693340468010958980">Peter Ovo on Twitter</a>), Moore brought up the challenges going against Sony after the success of the original PlayStation. Basically, it wasn't easy to get games on Xbox initially. "You're writing really big checks at this point to get content," he said. "You don't have an install base you can point to. You have forecasts, if anyone's going to believe them."</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">That meant, according to Moore, spending $5 million to $20 million to sometimes just get day and date parity with PS2 third-party games. He said developers and publishers in the 2000s were very much in "Sony's pocket" following the aftermath of the Sega DreamCast and original PlayStation.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-xbox-exec-says-millions-were-spent-to-get-games-parity-with-ps2/1100-6517070/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">I used to think I was unreasonably harsh on Disney's attempts at live-action Star Wars because I didn't like any of it. Then I watched Andor and saw what a legitimately good Star Wars TV show looked like. I'd rather not go back to the old normal. But despite its attempts to pretend otherwise in the two episodes provided by Disney+ ahead of the series premiere, the old normal is exactly what Ahsoka represents. Unless you're a Rebels fan dying to follow up on that cliffhanger from the series finale, there's no reason to watch this show.</p><p dir="ltr">Ahsoka begins with a pair of villainous Force users--Baylan Skoll and Shin Hati--invading a New Republic Cruiser to rescue a one-off villain from Season 2 of The Mandalorian named Morgan Elsbeth. As we learned back then, Elsbeth knows something about the location of the missing Imperial Grand Admiral Thrawn, and they imply that somebody (it's not said who) paid these Force-wielders to rescue Elsbeth and help with her quest to bring him back.</p><p dir="ltr">Coincidentally, in the very next scene we see Ahsoka Tano reenact the opening credits of Guardians of the Galaxy, but more boringly and without dancing--she visits some kind of ancient archaeological site in the middle of nowhere on some nothing planet to recover a magical orb, after which she is immediately confronted by and has to fight some baddies who work for the main villain. This orb contains the map to Thrawn, who may or may not be in a different galaxy. So Ahsoka reconvenes with surviving characters from Rebels, Hera Syndulla, and Sabine Wren, and the race to Thrawn is on.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ahsoka-review-for-star-wars-rebels-fans-only/1900-6418108/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>One of the big changes coming to Destiny 2 after The Final Shape will be Episodes, a big shake-up to the post-launch content of the game. While Destiny 2 has used a seasonal structure for several years now, usually four over a one-year period, Episodes will be three larger slices of content that add new rewards over several weeks.</p><figure style="width: 1280px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4181664-destiny-2-episodes.jpg"><img alt="Destiny 2's first set of Episodes" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4181664-destiny-2-episodes.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Destiny 2's first set of Episodes</figcaption></figure><p>Echoes, Revenant, and Heresy are the first Episodes arriving after The Final Shape launches and deal with the fallout of that expansion. Each episode has been designed to be a standalone experience that can be played in any order regardless of your experience with Destiny 2, and Bungie says these will provide the foundation for the future of the game.</p><p>Episodes will provide new ways to engage with Destiny 2, creating innovative experiences that help define the next stage of Destiny 2's evolution. Each Episode will be split into three Acts--with a new Act releasing every six weeks--and contain new stories, quests, activities, weapons, artifact mods, pass ranks, and other rewards.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-future-of-destiny-2-retires-its-seasons-for-something-totally-new-and-different/1100-6517074/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Revealed as recently as April of this year, the magic based first-person shooter Immortals of Aveum is out now, and the reviews are in.</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately for Ascendant Studios, its debut title is looking to be somewhat of a mixed bag in reviews released for the game so far. On the higher end of the scale, reviewers seem to be finding the fast-paced, spell-oriented shooting one of its strong suits, though critics don't seem to be united on that front as some found it to be quite repetitive. Opinions on the game's story are mixed too, with a number of reviews finding it to be overall forgettable.</p><p dir="ltr">"Immortals of Aveum stops just short of fully complementing its traditional military shooter story with an engaging environmentalist message, instead opting to primarily use those narrative themes to inform the world design and lore," wrote Jordan Ramée in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/immortals-of-aveum-review-run-and-gun/1900-6418107/">Immortals of Aveum review</a>.

<p dir="ltr">When it comes to modern fantasy novels, few book series are as epic as Steven Erikson's Malazan Book of the Fallen series. This New York Times-bestselling series is set in a magical world dominated by a powerful force known as the Malazan Empire, and the main storyline spans 10 novels. It's an ambitious tale, perfect for anyone looking to get lost in a world of magic, intercontinental wars, and supernatural beings--and right now, you can grab all 10 books, plus seven tie-in books, for just $18 thanks to Humble's Malazan Book of the Fallen ebook Bundle.</p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100770772-14555742?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.humblebundle.com/books/steven-eriksons-malazan-book-fallen-tor-publishing-group-books">See at Humble</a> </div><p dir="ltr">While the full 17-book bundle is the best value, those looking to just dip into the world of Malazan can opt for one of the smaller, cheaper tiers. The basic $1 option includes an ebook version Gardens of the Moon, the first novel in the series. The next tier jumps up to $10 and adds the next three books in the series: Deadhouse Gates, Memories of Ice, and House of Chains.</p><p dir="ltr">If you pay at least $18, you get the six remaining volumes in the main Malazan Book of the Fallen series plus seven tie-in books, including The God is Not Willing, which is the first release in a new trilogy of Malazan novels by Erikson. Check the bundle's Humble store page for the full lineup of included titles. All ebooks in the bundle come in .ePub format and are readable on Kindle and other e-reader apps.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steve-erikson-malazan-humble-bundle/1100-6517044/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Forza Motorsport developer Turn 10 has confirmed Forza Motosport's PC specs, as well as one of the tracks that will be available at launch, and all of the racing wheels you can use with the game.</p><p dir="ltr">As part of celebrating its presence at Gamescom in Cologne, Germany, Turn 10 has revealed that the famous Nürburgring  circuit will be included in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-motorsport-release-date-cars-and-everything-we-know/1100-6505944/">Forza Motorsport</a> (which would be Forza Motorsport 8, but the team opted for a simplified title) when it releases in October. On top of that, the 12.9-mile long Nordschleife is also being added in Spring 2024. According to the <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-motorsport-gamescom">announcement post</a>, both tracks have been completely rebuilt for Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p><p dir="ltr">The announcement post also confirmed the minimum, recommended, and ideal PC specs you will need in order to run the game at either low, high, or ultra settings. You'll definitely need to clear up your hard drive a little, as no matter what you'll need 130 GB of space. More importantly, though, an SSD is recommended even for minimum specs, which might make things about tough for older PCs. There are a wide range of options for GPUs at the very least, only needing a GTX 1060. But on ultra settings you'll need an RTX 4080, one of the highest-end cards out there at the moment. It doesn't mention what frame rate target or resolution each of these settings will hit, but you can read the full list of specs below:</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-motorsport-pc-specs-and-compatible-racing-wheels-have-been-confirmed/1100-6517054/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Microsoft Will Sell Activision Cloud Rights To Ubisoft In Latest Attempt To Secure Its Acquisition

<p>Microsoft has <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/08/21/microsoft-activision-restructure-acquisition/">announced</a> its latest attempt to adjust its acquisition of Activision Blizzard in order to satisfy regulators in the UK. The company has entered into a partnership with Ubisoft, which will see cloud streaming rights for all current and new Activision Blizzard games transferred to Ubisoft over the next 15 years.</p><p>This move is a response to a block by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which aimed to prevent the Microsoft and Activision Blizzard merger because the joint entity would have too much power in the cloud gaming space. In an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/22/23828302/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-ubisoft-cloud-gaming-rights-uk-cma">internal memo obtained by The Verge</a>, Xbox's Phil Spencer reportedly confirmed such, saying, "To address the concerns about the impact of the proposed acquisition on cloud game streaming raised previously by the UK Competition and Markets Authority, we are modifying the transaction to acquire a narrower set of rights."</p><p>Under this new restructured transaction, Microsoft won't be able to offer Activision Blizzard games exclusively on Xbox Cloud Gaming or to control the licensing terms of those games for competing services. Ubisoft will also compensate Microsoft for the cloud streaming rights to Activision Blizzard's games, and Ubisoft will also be able to offer those same games to cloud gaming services running on non-Windows systems.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-will-sell-activision-cloud-rights-to-ubisoft-in-latest-attempt-to-secure-its-acquisition/1100-6517056/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

The first wave includes the first seasons of Loki and WandaVision, and Star Wars: The Mandalorion Seasons 1 and 2.

Along with the complete season on Blu-ray, the steelbook case, and the bonus concept art cards, Loki Season 1 will also include bonus features like deleted scenes, a gag reel, and behind-the-scenes featurettes.</p><p dir="ltr">Disney's official press release says more information will be shared about the other three steelbook sets at a later date, but we expect them to feature similar bonus materials.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-mandalorian-loki-and-wandavision-are-finally-getting-4k-blu-ray-releases/1100-6517043/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Fort Solis Review - Strife On Mars

<p dir="ltr">Put a few humans in outer space for a story set in the future and the result always seems to be that nothing will go their way. That's once again the broad strokes of this latest space thriller, Fort Solis, but the intrigue, as ever, is in the details. Developer Fallen Leaf does a good job of hiding the satisfying answers to its central mysteries up to the very end, which makes its story consistently absorbing even as some of its gameplay elements betray its own Hollywood-inspired intentions.</p><p dir="ltr">Fort Solis is a third-person adventure game that tells a story reminiscent of Moon and 2001: A Space Odyssey. It's slow, sometimes to a fault, and more concerned with its message and themes than action set-pieces. That doesn't mean it's a low-stakes tale. On the contrary, the secrets tucked away in Fort Solis are existential, but it's expressed through the eyes of a small cast of interesting characters whom you'll get to know over the game's five-hour story.</p><p dir="ltr">Fort Solis has AAA aspirations, and it shows quite clearly in a few ways. For one, the game looks gorgeous. Built in Unreal Engine and presenting gameplay in an over-the-shoulder style, it would be easy to mistake this indie for the next big-budget cinematic thriller. That's further solidified by its exceptional cast headlined by Roger Clark and Troy Baker, but the complete cast of about 10 or so people is just as well-written and with great performances to match. Clark's Leary and Julia Brown's Jessica Appleton do well to color in the world in the first hour, including their own characters who would otherwise be amorphous Mars transplants in drab uniforms.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fort-solis-review-strife-on-mars/1900-6418105/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Half-Life 2 is getting the RTX treatment, with a new community-made remaster that will add full ray tracing to the classic first-person shooter.</p><p dir="ltr">As part of a new reveal from Nvidia showing off <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/08/22/gamescom-dlss-ray-reconstruction/">AI-enhanced real-time ray tracing</a> using DLSS 3.5, Half-Life 2 RTX: An RTX Remix Project was announced. The project uses the same modding tools that spun off from last year's <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/news/half-life-2-rtx-remix-in-development/">Portal with RTX</a>, and is being developed by "four of Half-Life 2’s top mod teams, now working together under the banner of Orbifold Studios," according to a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/news/half-life-2-rtx-remix-in-development/">blog post</a> about it.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">"As with the Portal projects, almost every asset is being reconstructed in high fidelity, and full ray tracing (otherwise known as path tracing) is being leveraged to bring cutting-edge graphics to Half-Life 2. In Half-Life 2 RTX, average world textures have eight times the pixels, and assets like the suit feature 20 times the geometric detail of the original game.

## Immortals Of Aveum Review - Run And Gun

<p>At first, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/immortals-of-aveum/">Immortals of Aveum</a> pleasantly surprised me, putting a lot more stock into its narrative themes of environmentalism than I expected its wartime story to cover. The focus for this first-person shooter, however, is still on blasting baddies, albeit with a variety of bullet-inspired spells instead of traditional firearms. And although all the shooting is exciting for the first half of the game, it becomes increasingly annoying in the latter half when firefights get longer and more frequent. These shoot-outs interrupt the story's momentum by dragging it out, curating an irritating sense of repetitive tedium.</p><p dir="ltr">Though you're slinging spells in Immortals, the magic you're casting is more cosmetic flavoring to what is otherwise a fairly traditional military shooter. Red magic unleashes with all the concussive force of a shotgun while green magic slowly ramps with the heated ferocity of a light machine gun and blue magic slices through the air with the precision of a bolt-action rifle. You switch between them at the push of the button, though annoyingly only in a cycle of blue to red to green and back to blue. There's no way to immediately leapfrog to the magic you need.</p><p dir="ltr">The lack of a quality-of-life feature as mainstream as a weapon wheel is quite noticeable in Immortals, which sees you frequently switch between your three equipped styles of magic. Not only does each color of magic fire differently, many enemies are armored against all but one color, meaning you need to oftentimes switch to a specific color when focusing on a new target. Early into the game, when you're only fighting a handful of enemies at a time, this drawback isn't that noticeable. But once you get far enough into Immortals' story, you find yourself fighting wave after wave of dozen-odd enemies, each of which requires a specific color of magic to defeat. And having to cycle through the animation of summoning green magic just to have the option to switch to the blue magic I need can be costly in as fast-paced a shooter as Immortals, where enemies hit hard and nimbly move about the battlefield. A carefully lined-up shot may no longer be there by the time you switch to the needed color.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/immortals-of-aveum-review-run-and-gun/1900-6418107/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
