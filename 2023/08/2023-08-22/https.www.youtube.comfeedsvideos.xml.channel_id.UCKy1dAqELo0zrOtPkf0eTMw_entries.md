"Hellboy Web of Wyrd will be available on Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and Steam on October 4, 2023. Watch the latest trailer to see Hellboy take on fearsome enemies from this roguelite action-adventure game, featuring an original story created in partnership with Dark Horse Comics. 

Featuring monstrous toe-to-toe brawling, you need to chain together hard-hitting melee and ranged attacks to fight a diverse array of increasingly nightmarish enemies. Like the comics, the game sends Hellboy on a series of vastly different and wholly unique adventures. While those stories stand on their own, they are all tied to the mysterious legacy of The Butterfly House."

Ahsoka reviewed by Samantha Nelson. Narrated by Clint Gage.

Disney+’s new live action series Ahsoka has the potential to explore the more cosmic and mystical aspects of the Star Wars universe, but the first two episodes feel flat at times as characters have to spend too much time catching up viewers who didn’t watch Star Wars Rebels. The action and visuals are spectacular, but the new actors are too stiff in their portrayal of the wonderful cast of characters that made Dave Filoni’s animated series worthy of continuation.

Immortals of Aveum reviewed by Luke Reilly on Xbox Series X. Also available on PlayStation 5 and PC.

"Immortals of Aveum is an impressively confident first-person shooter that successfully trades muzzles and magazines for mages and magic. Its fast-paced, spellcasting combat is both satisfying to master and spectacular to look at, and it features a lengthy and hearty campaign packed with secrets to keep us going well after the story has wrapped. As someone who desperately hopes that unapologetically single-player shooters will live forever, these Immortals have done a great job of making sure they’re definitely not dead yet."
