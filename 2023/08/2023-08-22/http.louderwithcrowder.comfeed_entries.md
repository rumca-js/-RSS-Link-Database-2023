<p>I have to fact-check our friend PBD. America doesn't have hundreds of different genders. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/san-francisco-guaranteed-income" target="_blank">We only have ninety-seven</a>. San Francisco says so. My favorites are "Genderfuck," "Gender Outlaw," and then all the ones that look like someone smashed their hand on the keyboard.<br /></p><p>Khabib says he sees only women and men, and there is no in-between. Then <a href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/khabib-nurmagomedov-only-2-genders" target="_blank">he shared a humorous story</a> about trying to use a public bathroom in...you guessed it...<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/california-legalize-child-kidnapping" target="_blank">California</a>.</p><p>"I was in California, I was like in coffee shop. I really want to go bathroom, 'Can I go bathroom?' Okay, they told me 'cool,' and I'm kind of like, two [bathrooms], 'all gender' [and] 'all gender.' What is this? Where I have to go? "I stopped, like, I spent like five seconds there, like, where is women, where's men? I knocked [on] the door, 'Anybody inside?' Okay. I don't know, brother."</p><p>It is a damn shame Khabib isn't an active fighter. The ESPN outrage over this would amazeballs.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Conservative congressman warns Joe Rogan's California friends to keep their progressive BS out of Texas

CLICK HERE!</em></a></strong></p><p>Joe Rogan was the highest profile person to leave California during the lockdowns. Once Gavin Newsom went full commie, Rogan went to Texas where they still value freedom. With the concern of more lockdowns coming, more people may be getting ready to leave their progressive-run state once leaders ignore science and data in favor of politics and "the science." It's a good time to remind of everyone of Rep. Wesley Hunt's warning.</p><p>When Hunt was just a candidate in 2020 (<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dan-crenshaw-greatest-ad-ever" target="_blank">and a part of the greatest campaign ad ever</a>), he paid a visit to Joe's first gingivitis-colored Austin studios. Seriously, what the deuce was up with those walls? Heed what Wesley had to say. Don't turn this place into what you fled.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>
<p>"Come one come all. Give me your tired,  your poor. Come to Texas," says Hunt. "But you got to understand. something. You're coming here because of low taxes and low regulation, and you want to live your life in liberty and make sure that you can protect0 yourself and protect your family. That means you have to vote a certain way. That's why we kind of are Texas."</p><p>He adds, "I understand people have different views and whatnot. But you're here for a reason."</p><p>Hunt's point is important not just for Californians, but for everyone who lives in blue states. New York is a prime example. </p><p>New Yorkers continue to vote for politicians who raise their taxes and make living here unaffordable. New Yorkers decided they don't want high taxes and an unaffordable standard of living, so they flee to states like Florida and North Carolina, where they continue to vote for people who raise taxes and make living unaffordable. </p><p>The social issues are a con, a way for Democrats to convince you that a vote for anyone besides a Democrat is a vote for "hate," when a vote for a Democrat is really a vote to let them take more of your money and make it harder for someone to thrive without the government. Like Rogan said, <em>"What is [California] going to do with that [higher taxes]? F*ck it up worse?"</em></p><p>Rogan by all accounts has been heeding Hunt's warning since this interview. The podcaster says now "Keep Austin weird... and surrounded" by all the rural areas to make sure the blue state important don't f*ck it up.</p><p>Hunt was elected to Congress in 2022 and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/wesley-hunt-border-crisis" target="_blank">become one of our top conservative leaders</a>. Also, if you'll allow me to culturally appropriate urban vernacular, my man always looks fresh to death. I know the media expects us to believe <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/john-fetterman-hoodie-shorts" target="_blank">John Fetterman is "redefining" fashion in Congress</a>. But c'mon now.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>It's not an apples-to-apples comparison. This looks like an Instagram video judging by the text. But it still got be thinking.

<p>"Apparently in China, the way that the algorithm works, it doesn't reward people doing stupid dances and playing with their dog. The algorithm is rewarding that they want to see their youth do. So, people doing cool engineering sh*t. People doing cool science sh*t. But if you're China and you wanted to disrupt another country, wouldn't you reward the dumbest possible sh*t on that app. Twerkin. People doing stupid dances. You want the next level of youth to go "I can be famous doing something that is worthless to society."</p><p>You can't escape the egg smashing or "ice cream so good." I only see the video of this kid because I have @CatchUpFeed bookmarked, who found the video accidentally.</p><p>Even if the video with the kid isn't creatively edited (allow for missing context, yadda yadda), viral success could still lead to your kid wanting to learn how to fix cars with you. Instead of having their attention span decimated fifteen-second song bites at a time.</p><p>It makes ya think.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: Joe Biden's visit to Maui was embarrassing for America even by usual Joe Biden standards

But I seem to recall when a hurricane hit Puerto Rico, the media freaking out because Trump threw paper towels out of the back of a truck like footballs. In Maui, when school starts, students are going to be missing what's estimated to be up to 25% of their classmates. There is considerably less media outrage when <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/4-things-caused-the-maui-wildfires" target="_blank">every level of government in Hawaii is run by Democrats</a>.</p><p>On Monday, Biden took a break from vacation to visit the victims of the wildfires. And then went back on vacation. Here's how the President of the United States addressed the issue prior:</p><p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-no-comment-maui" target="_self" title="view post: Joe Biden's heartless two-word response about Maui fire proves how little he cares about Americans when on vacation (again)">Joe Biden's heartless two-word response about Maui fire proves how little he cares about Americans when on vacation (again)</a></p><p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-maui-wildfire-700" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self" title="view post: Do the Math: Joe Biden brags about giving Maui Wildfire victims $700 after giving Ukraine $2500 per person">Do the Math: Joe Biden brags about giving Maui Wildfire victims $700 after giving Ukraine $2500 per person</a></p><p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-forgets-maui" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self" title="view post: Watch: Joe Biden forgets the name of the island on fire while discussing the Maui Wildfire">Watch: Joe Biden forgets the name of the island on fire while discussing the Maui Wildfire</a></p><p>Biden received a hero's welcome when landing on the Hawaiian island.

<p>Both my parents' tragically died of cancer. Do you know who I wouldn't tell that to? People who lost their loved ones and their livelihood because it's not about me.

<p>And the coup de derp. Biden showing "empathy" because he too almost lost his home to a fire. His cat and his Corvette too. These are words Biden said out loud, presumably approved by his staff but you can never be too sure. Also, how many people do you think Biden said "Hey look, I just got laid" to?</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Like many Biden stories, the <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/watch-biden-again-adds-fuel-to-story-about-lightning-sparking-fire-at-his-home" target="_blank">almost losing his house story is bullplop</a>. Lighting struck his house, it caused a small fire in his kitchen, and it was dealt with within twenty minutes. In comparison, it's been 10,080 minutes since Biden's first "no comment" to when he finally addressed the victims of the Maui Wildfire.</p><p>The President of the United States has returned to vacation. To quote one of the most important Polynesian philosophers of the 21st century, "Traitor Joe Must Go."</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
