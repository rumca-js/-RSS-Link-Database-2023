The original blue [&#8230;]

For all of the hype Silicon Valley gets as the birthplace of American technological innovation, the broadband networks in cities like Palo Alto have never kept pace. Like most towns and cities across the U.S., Palo Alto residents have long complained about the slow speeds, high prices, and comically terrible customer service they get from [&#8230;]

This is just so painfully obnoxious. The legacy news media, spurred on by a welfare system that pretend free market supporter Rupert Murdoch dreamed up and convinced governments to implement, whereby the government would force internet companies, which had innovated and created new business models that worked, to suddenly be required to pay for sending [&#8230;]

This is a bit of an oddity. We&#8217;ve seen lots of lawsuits against social media services filed by bigots who are upset their accounts have been banned or their content removed because, well, they&#8217;re loaded with bigotry. You know, &#8220;conservative views,&#8221; as they say. This one goes the other direction. It claims YouTube&#8217;s moderation algorithm [&#8230;]

And, really, if he just stopped doing stupid things, I [&#8230;]
