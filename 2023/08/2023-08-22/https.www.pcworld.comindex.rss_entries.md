<p>Logitech&rsquo;s top-of-the-line keyboard design returns in an S variant, this time with an updated Bolt multi-device receiver and new a new auto-adjusting backlight feature. The typing experience is as good as it was in the original model, and it&rsquo;s even a tiny bit cheaper, so this upgrade is a win-win if you like your keyboards thin and stylish. Just be aware that dozens of Bluetooth devices in the vicinity might bog it down. If you prefer your Logitech boards a little more clicky-clacky, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/812395/logitech-mx-mechanical-keyboard-review-2.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">check out the MX Mechanical variant</a>. </p>

<p>Logitech does it again with the MK540 Advanced combo. It might not have the convenience of backlighting that the K800 offers, but it hits all the other important features for productivity: a roomy layout, dedicated media buttons, a numpad, programmable keys, and tactile typing. In addition to all that, the keyboard comes with a decent wireless mouse, that is itself programmable, so you&rsquo;re good to go. </p>

<p>For a long time, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/402217/corsair-k63-gaming-keyboard-review.html">Corsair&rsquo;s K63</a> has been our pick for best wireless gaming keyboard. We still like that keyboard a lot, but after recently reviewing the Razer BlackWidow V3 Pro, we&rsquo;ve found a new favorite. It&rsquo;s got everything you&rsquo;d want from a gaming keyboard: full-size layout, mechanical switches, RGB, a wrist rest, a volume wheel&mdash;and the convenience of a wireless connection. Yes, it&rsquo;s also pretty pricey, as premium products often are. That leaves the K63 as a still-very-respectable lower-priced alternative.</p>

<p>The Redragon K596 is a fully wireless mechanical gaming keyboard packing many of the features you&rsquo;d expect from a premium model. While the K596 isn&rsquo;t amazing in any one particular area, at this price it doesn&rsquo;t have to be. It covers all of the basics you would want from a wireless keyboard such as programmability, per-key RGB, volume wheel, macro keys, and a magnetic wrist rest. In contrast to the ballooning prices of modern gaming keyboards, the Redragon K596 represents a fantastic value.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t let the relatively high price scare you off. The MX Keys Mini is probably the best compact wireless keyboard around. It&rsquo;s small but mighty&mdash;super comfortable to type on, offers a semi-customizable layout, supports multi-device switching, and more. If you want to work on the go, this board is not only an easy pack, it easily earns its keep by deftly standing out from others in its class.</p>

<p>This wireless update to Keychron&rsquo;s best-in-class Q series has everything: a full aluminum case, hot-swap sockets and VIA programming for customization, PBT keycaps, and multi-device Bluetooth pairing. It&rsquo;s equally at home with Mac or Windows users, and shockingly, it&rsquo;s less expensive that a lot of of the boutique mechanical designs it&rsquo;s aping. Not that it&rsquo;s cheap, mind you, but if you want a wireless mech with every possible bell and whistle (except 2.4GHz wireless), this is it. </p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve reviewed a lot of keyboards at PCWorld, and this one has the best &ldquo;feel&rdquo; of any of them. If you spend hours a day typing, then the high-quality keycaps, exotics switches, and classy components like a brass deck plate and interior foam will make your fingers feel like they&rsquo;re at a day spa. The plastic case is a bit of a let-down and the customization software is clunky, but there&rsquo;s no better mech on the market for pure typing performance. And a nice bonus: Wireless comes in both Bluetooth and 2.4GHz flavors. </p>

<p>Logitech&rsquo;s Ergo K860 has finally conquered our skepticism about awkward ergonomic keyboards. In the course of our review, there was a marked improvement in typing comfort and reduced muscle tension, all without sacrificing productivity to a steep learning curve. It&rsquo;s a little expensive compared to a conventional wireless keyboard, but if you&rsquo;re struggling with comfort, the K860 is the only ergonomic keyboard we&rsquo;d heartily recommend.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-we-test-wireless-keyboards">How we test wireless keyboards</h2>



<p>It was hands-on all the way with our keyboard testing. We spent at least one full workday typing exclusively on each model we tested, with follow-up time to allow for a learning curve. We assessed the primary typing experience: key design, typing feel, and even noisiness. We also tried the secondary features: hotkeys, switches and dials on multi-platform models, and even the ability to adjust the angle or other comfort characteristics.</p>



<p>We considered the size, weight, and durability of each model against its purpose&mdash;whether it was designed to be portable or desk-bound, and compact or fully featured. For instance, we balance the versatility of multi-platform models like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3118222/input-keyboards/logitech-k780-wireless-keyboard-review-one-fantastic-keyboard-for-your-computer-phone-and-tablet.html">Logitech&rsquo;s K780</a> against its performance as an actual keyboard you need to use everyday (and in this case, it wins on all counts).&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-to-shop-for-a-wireless-keyboard">How to shop for a wireless keyboard</h2>



<p>You&rsquo;re going to use this keyboard every day, so make sure it fits your typing habits and your needs. Here&rsquo;s what to keep in mind as you shop.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Size:</strong> A model that will always sit on your desktop can be bigger and heavier, and usually some other advantages some with that. As more of us carry laptops or tablets, however, we&rsquo;ll look for models that are compact or portable. These will sacrifice some features but be easier to take with you.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Keys:</strong> Look for&nbsp;keys that are sculpted and spaced for typing comfort. This is why we encourage trying before buying: We&rsquo;ve had very different experiences with traditional keys vs. chiclet-style vs. flatter key designs, and it&rsquo;s surprising how little things like the texture or the amount of dimple will make or break a choice. Most mainstream keyboards use membrane technology, which is adequate for most users, but heavy-duty users and gamers will likely prefer keyboards with mechanical switches (which are not reviewed here).&nbsp;Windows hotkeys, or even programmable keys, are great bonuses, especially for power users.</p>



<p><strong>Adjustability:</strong> Some keyboards offer no adjustment for angle or height. Look for models with adjustable legs or feet. We haven&rsquo;t included ergonomic models in this round of reviews.</p>



<p><strong>Battery needs:</strong> All wireless keyboards use batteries. Check closely for the type and number of batteries you need, and whether a starter set is included. We note the vendors&rsquo; specified battery life in each review.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What&rsquo;s the difference between a Bluetooth keyboard and a wireless keyboard?<br /></h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Wireless keyboards connect to a PC in one of two ways: via Bluetooth or a USB receiver. Wireless keyboards that connect via a USB receiver or dongle can only connect to a computer or device if it has a USB port. Bluetooth connectivity on the other hand does not require any dongle or extra receiver and can therefore easily connect to other Bluetooth-enabled devices without the need for any ports. Additionally, Bluetooth keyboards tend to cost a little more but also offer longer battery life.</p>



<p>While shopping, you may find that older devices do not support Bluetooth. However, if you need a keyboard to work across different platforms on newer devices, a Bluetooth-enabled model is the way to go.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Yes, you can use a wireless keyboard with a laptop without issue. Depending on whether you are using a wireless USB dongle keyboard or a Bluetooth keyboard, you just need to connect to the laptop and then you are good to go. This is true if you wish to connect a wireless keyboard to your tablet or 2-in-1, as well.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Usually wireless keyboards are powered using either rechargeable or disposable batteries. Wireless keyboards with rechargeable batteries will just need to be plugged into an external power source such as a computer or wall outlet when the battery is low. Otherwise, wireless keyboards with disposable batteries will need those batteries to be replaced when they die. The most common types of batteries these keyboards use will be either AA or AAA alkaline batteries.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Wireless keyboards are a fantastic option for most people, but they have a few limitations when it comes to gaming. Wireless keyboards can produce some slight latency issues between the keystroke being made and it being registered by your computer. This lag can be especially frustrating when playing games that require fast reaction times or in competitive environments &mdash; the latency may in some instances lead to a competitive disadvantage.</p>



<p>That being said, wireless technologies have improved immensely in recent years and any lag or interference issues are becoming extremely rare with the latest technology. Most casual gamers will be just fine with a wireless keyboard &mdash; opt for 2.4GHz wireless over Bluetooth for the most reliable results. You can minimize  interference issues by keeping other wireless devices away from your wireless keyboard, as well.</p>

<p>Put simply, the Kensington Thunderbolt 4 Dual 4K Docking Station (SD5760T) is a premium Thunderbolt 4 dock whose dual HDMI ports should be perfect for the majority of PC users. On paper, anyway. Persistent stability problems mean that I can&rsquo;t totally recommend it.</p>



<p>Prior to this, I&rsquo;ve reviewed three Kensington Thunderbolt docks to date: the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/918583/kensington-sd5500t-thunderbolt-3-dock-review.html">SD5500T</a>, the<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/918583/kensington-sd5500t-thunderbolt-3-dock-review.html"> </a><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1384482/kensington-sd5780t-review-an-excellent-pricey-thunderbolt-4-dock.html">SD5780T</a>, and the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/817084/kensington-sd5700t-thunderbolt-4-docking-station-review-2.html">SD5700T</a>, all winning an Editors&rsquo; Choice awards. Of the three, only the SD5500T included a pair of dedicated display ports &mdash; DisplayPort, in this case. If you want a full-featured Thunderbolt 4 dock with a pair of the most commonly used <em>HDMI</em> ports instead, the SD5760T is what you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>



<p>Remember, Thunderbolt 4 was designed as a tighter, more restrictive Thunderbolt 3 specification to ensure compatibility and stability. This means that you&rsquo;ll really want to own a laptop with Thunderbolt 4 ports for the best experience. Thunderbolt 4 and USB 4 are virtually identical, so don&rsquo;t expect any problems with an AMD Ryzen-powered laptop with USB4 inside.</p>

</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="kensington-sd5760-specs-and-features">Kensington SD5760 specs and features</h2>



<p>The SD5760T is a big dock; a little shy of 9 inches long and 3.5 inches wide, with a chunky power brick that&rsquo;s a couple inches shorter. This is clearly a docking station, made from the same plastic construction as other Kensington docks. I didn&rsquo;t experience any thermal issues, however.</p>



<p>The size, though, accommodates a number of ports. There&rsquo;s maybe just a bit less flexibility than the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/814540/plugable-tbt3-udz-thunderbolt-dock-review.html">Plugable TBT3-UDZ</a>, which includes both DisplayPort and HDMI display connections, but it&rsquo;s more than enough. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Kensington SD5760T Thunderbolt 4 Dual 4K docking station" class="wp-image-2027770" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Kenisngton-SD5760T-alt-front.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The Kensington SD5760T includes a headphone/mic jack, an SD/micrSD card slot, two USB-A ports, and both an upstream and downstream Thunderbolt port.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>On the front of the Kensington SD5760T are a pair of 5Gbps USB-A ports, an upstream/daisy-chainable Thunderbolt 4 port, as well as a second downstream Thunderbolt 4 port that supplies up to 96W of charging power to your PC via a cable measuring about 2.5 feet. There&rsquo;s also a (UHS-II) microSD and SD card slot, a 3.5mm audio/mic port, and a power button for good measure. </p>



<p>On the back, the SD5760T includes two undisclosed HDMI ports capable of 4K60 resolution, two 10Gbps USB-A ports, a 10Gbps USB-C port, and gigabit Ethernet. Two Kensington locks, naturally, have been built into the side of the dock. Everything is well marked.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The SD5760T might not support <em>every</em> port that a user will ask for, just the ones that they&rsquo;ll use most often.</p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-well-does-the-kensington-sd5760t-perform">How well does the Kensington SD5760T perform?</h2>



<p>The SD5760T&rsquo;s charging capabilities are disappointing from one perspective: Both the USB-A and USB-C ports put out about 2.5W to 2.6W, which is enough to charge a smartphone, but only slowly. Most competitors have a dedicated port that can be used for phone charging. On the other hand, if you&rsquo;re not using the second dedicated Thunderbolt 4 port (not the downstream Thunderbolt 4 port, which connects the dock to your PC) then that port can charge a phone and then some. It puts out 11.4W by our measurements, which will fast-charge a smartphone.</p>



<p>There&rsquo;s one aspect of the SD5760T that I have concerns about: its stability. I typically review a dock over the course of a few days, evaluating it in real-world conditions as well as specific test environments.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-i-found-with-the-kensingtons-sd5760t-stability">What I found with the Kensington&rsquo;s SD5760T stability</h2>



<p>I began with the SD5760T that Kensington provided for review.</p>



<p>Kensington&rsquo;s SD5760T was generally stable to begin with, though the dock disconnected three times during a Teams call, during which the Ethernet cable was connected to the dock, along with the two test displays. But it also disconnected, then reconnected the displays, on two random occasions the next morning. Thunderbolt docks aren&rsquo;t always known for consistent operation, especially with variances in the hardware and cables. Any disconnects and glitches are annoying, though, and these happened a bit more than I would have liked. (Incidentally, Kensington attaches a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.kensington.com/warranty/&amp;xcust=2-3-2024376-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">three-year limited warranty</a> to the SD5760T.)</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Kensington SD5760T Thunderbolt 4 Dual 4K docking station" class="wp-image-2027771" height="759" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Kenisngton-SD5760T-back-.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On the rear of the SD576T are two HDMI ports, two more (10Gbps) USB-A ports, a USB-C port, and Gigabit Ethernet.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Kensington does provide a Dockworks software utility, which I didn&rsquo;t initially install. The utility&rsquo;s documentation doesn&rsquo;t make any explicit promises about stability, just &ldquo;performance.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s there to allow you to prioritize either Ethernet versus Wi-Fi (if your setup allows it) and allows the dock to mirror your Ethernet&rsquo;s MAC address, for easier networking. (Weirdly, I was able to download and install Dockworks, but never actually launch the application.) I gave the SD5760T an extra day of testing while the Dockworks utility was running (as confirmed by Windows Task Manager).</p>



<p>Surprisingly, the problem worsened. On a Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio, the disconnects happened so frequently that I considered disconnecting the dock entirely. Similar issues occurred when testing on other laptops. (I use a suite of Intel Evo laptops, which Intel engineers test for Thunderbolt performance and other experiences.)</p>



<p>Occasionally I receive a review unit that proves defective, so I asked Kensington for a replacement. I then tested the second SD5760T for an additional 24 hours over the course of two days. </p>



<p>While the dock&rsquo;s stability noticeably improved, it still dropped the display connections three times during a 30-minute Microsoft Teams call. While that was the only time the replacement dock glitched, I think that would be too much for most users. Our review (and our lack of an Editor&rsquo;s Choice award) is largely based upon this, versus my experiences with rival docks. </p>



<p>From a performance standpoint, both instances of the SD5760T dock performed on par with its competition in terms of transferring data over the bus and writing to an SSD. I was able to watch our 4K test video without dropping any frames, even when writing to the SSD. The various ports performed as expected, too.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="should-you-buy-the-kensington-sd5760t">Should you buy the Kensington SD5760T?</h2>



<p>Kensington&rsquo;s SD5760T is priced a bit higher than the SD5500T, a Thunderbolt 3 dock that&rsquo;s predicated on the DisplayPort standard. However, I think the SD5760T&rsquo;s dual HDMI ports will have the broadest appeal among Kensington&rsquo;s Thunderbolt 4 docks. The SD5760T might not support <em>every</em> port that a user will ask for, just the ones that they&rsquo;ll use most often.</p>



<p>That being said, while the other Kensington docks we&rsquo;ve reviewed have been excellent, the SD5760T&rsquo;s stability issues make it an exception. Based upon my testing, I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it.</p>

<p>If you work with PDF files regularly then a PDF editor is an indispensable tool. Whether it&rsquo;s part of your job, you manage PDF files for your own personal use, or you just need to complete a one-off editing task, a top editor program is an essential piece of software. Full-featured editors such as <a href="https://adobe.prf.hn/click/camref:1011lroIY/pubref:2-1-702374-1-0-0/destination:https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/pricing.html" rel="nofollow">Adobe&rsquo;s Acrobat Pro DC</a> might provide all of the bells and whistles, but a free PDF editor can still offer most of the important tools of a paid service for no additional charge. </p>



<p>Plus, many free PDF editors are browser based, which means that you don&rsquo;t need to worry about about platform- or device-compatibility issues.</p>



<p>Of course, free products won&rsquo;t come with every feature of their premium counterparts. So, if you find that you need more advanced tools such as password protection, Bates numbering, or e-signatures, then you&rsquo;re probably better served by a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407214/best-pdf-editors.html">premium PDF editor</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-to-look-for-in-a-free-pdf-editor">What to look for in a free PDF editor</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Content editing: </strong>As its name indicates, a PDF editor&rsquo;s primary function is to enable you to edit a document. That includes the ability to add and modify text; insert, resize, and move images; and reorganize pages in the PDF. Most free PDF editors will let you perform these tasks, though they may impose daily limits on how many you can perform or how many documents you can edit.</li>



<li><strong>Create, convert, and export PDFs</strong>: A common need for a PDF editor is to create PDF files from scanned hard copies or by converting digital documents. A good free PDF editor will be able to convert common file formats such as Word, JPG, and HTML to a PDF and preserve the original formatting. It should also be able to export PDFs into other editable formats such as Microsoft Word and PowerPoint, HTML, or plain text, maintaining the original files hyperlinks, images, and other elements.</li>



<li><strong>Review and annotate: </strong>Most free PDF editors allow you to add comments and other annotations to PDF files during review. Typical annotation tools include sticky notes, shapes, and drawing markup options. </li>



<li><strong>Signatures</strong>: Often all you need a PDF editor for is to sign a document. This used to be a premium feature only available on paid desktop editors, but more free PDF editors are allowing users to create and add electronic signatures to documents.</li>
</ul>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>While there are a number of different types of PDF file formats, they all fall under the umbrella term of PDF documents. A PDF form is a type of PDF document that has editable form fields a user can fill out. Typically, parts of the document are static and can&rsquo;t be changed in a PDF form. These usually include questions and instructions for those who end up filling out the form later on. In a PDF form, the content fields a user fills out are typically open to editing and can offer a list of possible answer options or can be written in freely.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Yes. They are two entirely different document formats. While you can export from one file format to another, they are not the same. Word file formats are usually used for word processing, editing, and making changes to text. PDF documents on the other hand, are most often utilized for viewing, sharing, and printing documents. Additionally, Word files can be read and/or  written to and contain some version of the &ldquo;.doc&rdquo; file format. Whereas PDF files are typically read-only and contain the &ldquo;.pdf&rdquo; file format. </p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Yes. If you have a PDF document that you do not want anyone else to be able to edit, you can protect the file. You can do this by opening the file in Acrobat, clicking <em>Tools &gt; Protect</em>. Then you have a few options as to whether you want to just restrict editing with a password, or if you want to encrypt the file for further safety. Once you choose how you want to protect the PDF document, you can set a password and save.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Yes, many free PDF editors such as our top pick PDF Candy, allow you to merge two or more PDFs into one. As most free PDF editors are browser-based, you will just need to open up the PDF editor application or website in your browser and click the &ldquo;Merge&rdquo; option. It will then ask you to add the files of all PDFs you wish to merge. Once the files have been added, just make sure that they are in the correct position and alignment you want before proceeding with the merge. Afterwards, all of your previously PDF files will be merged together into one new PDF document. </p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Yes and no. Google doesn&rsquo;t provide a designated free PDF editor itself, but there are third-party Chrome extensions that you can use to help get the job done. Alternatively, you can make use of Google Drive to edit a PDF document. Simply upload the document onto your Google Drive and then select the file and right-click and select <em>Open with &gt; Google Docs</em>. The file will be opened as an editable Google Docs text document. Then just make your edits and when you&rsquo;re finished click <em>File &gt; Download &gt; PDF Document</em> to revert it back to a PDF file. </p>



<p>This method is a quick and easy way to edit a simple PDF document, but be careful as Google Docs can run into formatting issues if your original document has complex visual formatting such as tables and graphs. In this case, it&rsquo;s best to use a designated free or premium PDF editor.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a great time to upgrade your storage from a hard drive because solid-state memory prices are absolutely plummeting right now. And that goes double for PC gamers because new titles are starting to require the performance boost that comes with an SSD. Microsoft has released the recommended specs for <em>Forza Motorsport </em>(2023), and the bottom tier demands an SSD with 130 gigabytes of free space for the game to run at all. </p>



<p>This is the second high-profile PC game to require an SSD, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1996675/starfield-these-are-the-system-requirements-ssd-is-mandatory.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">following the upcoming <em>Starfield</em></a><em> </em>(also published by Microsoft). <em>Forza</em> requires a GTX 1060 or RX 5500 XT graphics card <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://forza.net/news/forza-motorsport-gamescom&amp;xcust=2-1-2038891-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on the lowest settings</a>, which is fairly beefy for a driving game. You&rsquo;ll need an RTX 4080/RX 7900 XT and a fairly recent CPU to hit the &ldquo;Ultra Settings&rdquo; level, taking advantage of tech like DLSS 2 or FSR 2.2 upscaling. </p>

<p>You might be wondering why any game needs ultra-fast storage, as opposed to a high-end GPU or speedy RAM. After all, you can always just deal with longer load times, right? Not anymore, unfortunately. The demand for SSDs in more PC games can be laid at the feet of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1484183/microsoft-directstorage-tech-finally-arrives-on-pc-forspoken-load-times.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Microsoft&rsquo;s DirectStorage technology</a>, which enables ultra-fast communication between the CPU and NVMe SSDs. Notably, the same tech is included in the latest Xbox Series X, where <em>Forza Motorsport 2023</em> will also be a major release. It&rsquo;s worth noting that, even without the DirectStorage requirement, multiplayer games like racers might just want all players to have fast loading to keep online matches flowing well. </p>



<p>But hey, if you&rsquo;re still rocking a hard drive, it might cost you less than the price of Forza itself to get that long-overdue upgrade. Here&rsquo;s a <a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=14154&amp;GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09QV692XY/?th=1&amp;ascsubtag=2-1-2038891-1-0-0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">1TB Gen 4 M.2 drive for under fifty bucks</a> at the time of writing. And you have plenty of time to install it before Forza Motorsport (or even Starfield) actually arrives on your system. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394727/hdr-gaming-on-pc-everything-you-need-to-know.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">High Dynamic Range</a> is one of those visual features that you just need to see to get the appeal. But once you&rsquo;ve played games with the technology, which dynamically adjusts a panel&rsquo;s backlight levels to match the specific colors (or lack thereof) in an image, it&rsquo;s hard to go back to the same old same old. But HDR is some fiddly tech, and it requires hardware, software, and drivers to work in tandem, as well as a good bit of user input to optimize the experience. Samsung and developer Nexon are working on changing that status quo. </p>



<p>The first game to offer &ldquo;automatic setup&rdquo; for HDR will be <em>The First Descendant, </em>a free-to-play sci-fi co-op shooter in the vein of <em>Warframe</em>.  In addition to a grab bag of some of the most advanced visual tech on the market, it&rsquo;s the first game to be compliant with the HDR10+ standard, which allows for &ldquo;deeper color, contrast and brightness&rdquo; and &ldquo;more accurate depiction of details in dark shadows and bright highlights,&rdquo; <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-teams-up-with-nexon-to-unveil-worlds-first-hdr10-gaming-title-the-first-descendant&amp;xcust=2-1-2038601-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">according to Samsung</a>. <em>The First Descendant</em> is being revealed at Gamescom in Germany this week ahead of an open beta on September 19th.</p>

<p>The automatic setup is a boon for gamers, who won&rsquo;t have to mess around with manual settings, while developers get tools that standardize HDR output across displays. What few displays there are that can actually take advantage of it, anyway. In order to implement HDR10+, you&rsquo;ll need both a TV or monitor and a graphics card that are compatible with the standard. </p>



<p>HDR10 is fairly common, but HDR10+ is still hard to find on gaming monitors, with only <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/563566/5-monitor-trends-from-ces-2022-that-pc-enthusiasts-need-to-pay-attention-to.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Samsung&rsquo;s high-end displays</a> starting to support it in 2022. On the GPU side, only Nvidia graphics cards support the technology at the GPU level, on the RTX 1650/1660, 2000, 3000, and 4000 series. </p>

<p>2023 has been a bad year for Western Digital. Last spring, a major security breach occurred that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1812843/hackers-might-have-your-western-digital-data.html">locked customers out of their cloud-connected storage devices</a>. Now the manufacturer is under fire for SSDs that unexpectedly disconnect and erase users&rsquo; data.</p>

They mainly concern a number of models in the SanDisk Extreme series of SSDs, but the 4-terabyte version of WD My Passport is said to have the same problem. One member of the Ars Technica editorial team &ndash; and another at <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/22291828/sandisk-extreme-pro-portable-my-passport-failure-continued&amp;xcust=2-1-2038611-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">The Verge</a> &ndash; reportedly experienced the sudden loss of data.</p>



<p>Western Digital released an <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support-en.wd.com/app/firmwareupdate&amp;xcust=2-1-2038611-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">update</a> in May, intended to solve problems with SSDs suddenly disconnecting from the computer. But given the large number of testimonies and the lawsuits that have now been filed against the manufacturer, as well as the corroborating reports from the Verge and Ars Technica, it seems that the problem still exists to some extent.</p>

## Liquid metal vs. thermal paste: Which CPU compound is better?

<p>Liquid metal as a heat transfer medium offers much better heat transfer compared to classic thermal paste. However, in practice it also harbors dangers, for example due to spillage. In the worst case, this can even cause damage to the PC components. Liquid metal should therefore be used with great care.</p>



<p>Liquid metal consists of metal alloys such as gallium, indium, and tin and has a higher thermal conductivity than thermal paste. This leads to better heat transfer and more effective cooling of the processor. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Fl&uuml;ssigmetall " class="wp-image-1980168" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/pcw08_LiquidMetal.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>Liquid metal conducts heat much better than conventional thermal paste. But it should be handled very carefully, as the liquid is also electrically conductive.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG</p></div>



<p>Despite these advantages, there are also reasons why many users continue to use conventional thermal paste. This is because liquid metal not only conducts heat particularly well, but also electrical current. Improper application can lead to short circuits and damage to PC components. Furthermore, liquid metal can be corrosive, especially when using aluminum heatsinks&mdash;when using liquid metal, you should use copper heatsinks for this reason. </p>



<p>In most cases, conventional thermal paste is sufficient for the PC. For powerful computers that require stronger cooling, switching to liquid metal could offer advantages, especially when overclocking. But even in such cases, it is advisable to weigh the risks thoroughly and seek expert assistance if necessary.</p>

## Nvidia DLSS 3.5’s AI Ray Reconstruction makes ray tracing look even better

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Nvidia created its Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) technology to help improve performance in games when you turn on ultra-strenuous ray traced visuals, all the way back when both ray tracing and DLSS were introduced alongside the GeForce RTX 20-series. DLSS 2 greatly improved the visual quality of upscaled images, while DLSS 3 added AI-generated frames to boost performance even more. Now, Nvidia returns to DLSS&rsquo;s ray tracing roots with DLSS 3.5, introduced today at Gamescom in Germany.</p>



<p>While <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1662185/what-is-dlss-3-nvidia-geforce-rtx-ai-feature-explained.html">DLSS 3 boosted performance</a>, DLSS 3.5&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ray Reconstruction&rdquo; aims to improve the visual quality of upscaled, ray traced games, specifically by turning Nvidia&rsquo;s AI models on a critical process called &ldquo;denoising.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Ray tracing is limited by the number of rays a GPU can &ldquo;cast&rdquo; into a given scene, to create the data needed for the realistic lighting effects. But there&rsquo;s no way to cast endless amounts of rays for picture-perfect images in games. Movie studios have all the time in the world to render the scenes for their films, but games need to respond instantaneously to you feedback without melting your GPU. As such, before a ray traced scene is rendered, modern games and graphics cards run &ldquo;denoisers&rdquo; devoted to eliminating the graininess caused by missing ray info in game frames.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="DLSS 3.5" class="wp-image-2037521" height="672" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/traditional-denoisers.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Nvidia</p></div>



<p>That&rsquo;s all well, good, and necessary, but it gets a bit more complicated, especially when DLSS gets involved. DLSS runs at a lower resolution than your display, then uses AI smarts to upscale the image to your native resolution. Traditional hand-tuned denoisers sample bits of a ray traced scene &mdash; either temporally, over multiple frames, or a spatial model based on neighboring pixels &mdash; and use the info to fill in the missing pixels where rays weren&rsquo;t able to be passed.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="DLSS 3.5" class="wp-image-2037520" height="677" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/denoiser-remove-info.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Nvidia</p></div>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="DLSS 3.5" class="wp-image-2037523" height="663" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/denoiser-limitations.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Nvidia</p></div>



<p>As anyone who has played a ray traced games know, the end result is pretty darn good. But Nvidia says traditional denoisers create slightly off outputs sometimes, resulting in lower-quality reflections and global illumination in especially detailed scenes, and inaccurate lighting effects on occasion. Have you ever played a game where your car&rsquo;s lights seemed to emanate from the bottom of your car rather than the headlights, or saw &ldquo;ghosting&rdquo; of its side mirrors traveling alongside your car? The way the denoisers and DLSS interplay is why.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="DLSS 3.5" class="wp-image-2037519" height="694" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ray-reconstruction-advantage.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Nvidia</p></div>



<p>Enter DLSS 3.5. Nvidia&rsquo;s new Ray Reconstruction technology replaces hand-tuned denoisers with an AI-powered denoiser that&rsquo;s trained to recognize good and bad pixels from both temporal and spatial denoising, identify ray tracing effects specifically, and incorporate other game information &mdash; like motion vectors and surface colors &mdash; for a much more accurate final image in ray traced games, as you can see in the images below.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="DLSS 3.5" class="wp-image-2037525" height="655" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/portal-rtx.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Nvidia</p></div>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="DLSS 3.5" class="wp-image-2037522" height="665" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cyberpunk-dlss.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Nvidia</p></div>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="DLSS 3.5" class="wp-image-2037524" height="671" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cyberpunk-reflections.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Nvidia</p></div>



<p>These are canned examples from Nvidia&rsquo;s press briefing, so take them with a grain of salt, but there&rsquo;s no denying whatsoever that the clarity, accuracy, and sharpness of ray tracing effects look significantly better with DLSS 3.5&rsquo;s Ray Reconstruction active. I can&rsquo;t wait to see it in action &mdash; and you can yourself if you check out Nvidia&rsquo;s booth at Gamescom this week.</p>



<p>DLSS 3.5 will debut later this year in <em>Cyberpunk 2077&rsquo;</em>s <em>Phantom Liberty </em>expansion this September, the just-as-hotly-anticipated <em>Alan Wake II </em>this October, and Nvidia&rsquo;s <em>Portal </em>RTX remake sometime this fall. It&rsquo;ll also be available in the D5 Render apps and Nvidia&rsquo;s Omniverse platform for creative types.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>You may see a small performance uplift in complex ray traced games, depending on how many denoisers Ray Reconstruction is replacing in the game engine, but to be clear, DLSS 3.5 focuses on ray traced visual quality, not speed.</p>

<p>Now for the better news: Unlike DLSS 3&rsquo;s AI-generated frames, which need special &ldquo;Optical Flow Accelerator&rdquo; hardware only found in new GeForce RTX 40-series GPUs, DLSS 3.5 works with <em>any</em> RTX graphics card &mdash; yes, even the original RTX 20-series offerings. <em>Awesome</em>. It will also be available for GeForce Now subscribers in supported games.</p>



<p>I&rsquo;ve already been hot and bothered about <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>&rsquo;s Idris Elba-starring <em>Phantom Liberty </em>expansion, and adding this nifty new technology on top only makes me that much more excited to return to the streets of Night City.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="DLSS 3.5" class="wp-image-2037527" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Half-Life-2-Suit-RTX-On.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Nvidia</p></div>



<p>Beyond DLSS 3.5, Nvidia also announced that a team of top <em>Half-Life 2</em> modders are joining forces to give the classic a full RTX Remix makeover, similar to <em>Portal RTX. </em>DLSS 3 (<em>not</em> 3.5) is also coming to <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, Payday 3, </em>and &mdash; get this &mdash; <em>Fortnite</em>. People have wondered how well DLSS 3&rsquo;s AI-generated frames would handle fast-paced competitive shooters, and soon we&rsquo;ll know.</p>



<p>Finally, on August 24, GeForce Now will get its first taste of Microsoft PC Game Pass games, including first-party titles like <em>Gears 5 </em>and Bethesda&rsquo;s <em>Deathloop</em>, along with a smattering of third-party games like <em>No Man&rsquo;s Sky</em>. You&rsquo;ll need to be a PC Game Pass subscriber to play them on GeForce Now, of course &mdash; here&rsquo;s a workaround explaining <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/397667/get-2-years-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-tip.html">how to get two years of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for dirt cheap</a>.</p>

## Protect your privacy by changing these new Chrome settings

<p>Safeguarding your privacy on the web is a thankless task. Ads are an especially irritating part of web browsing&mdash;everyone wants to track your browsing habits just to sell you things. But now preserving your anonymity is becoming a little easier, thanks to a new set of Google Chrome settings that gives more control over targeted ads.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s called Ad Privacy, and you&rsquo;ll need to dig into these settings to keep Google from using or sharing your browsing history for ad purposes. You get control over three aspects: ad topics, site-suggested ads, and ad measurement. Ad topics are themes identified from your recent browsing history that sites then use to personalize ads. Site-suggested ads are based on the sites you&rsquo;ve visited&mdash;the algorithm guesses at what you like, then generates related advertisements. Ad measurement allows your data to be shared among sites, so that they can measure how well their advertising is doing.</p>



<p>All three options are turned on by default&mdash;it&rsquo;s up to you to turn it off if you want to stop the flow of information. Fortunately, it takes just a few moments to adjust.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-to-control-your-ad-privacy-in-chrome">How to control your ad privacy in Chrome</h2>



<p>Ad Privacy hasn&rsquo;t reached all Chrome users yet&mdash;when I checked on four different PCs, just two of them had received the update. (One runs Windows 10, while the other is a Windows 11 machine.) When these settings become available, Chrome will display an overlay notification that lets you jump to them. You can also of course manually check your settings periodically to see if this new batch has appeared yet.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Enhanced ad privacy settings notification in Chrome" class="wp-image-2036188" height="667" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-6-1.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The notification that lets you jump to the new Ad Privacy settings. Shown in Chrome on a Windows 10 PC with dark mode on.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>To manually check (or if you need to find the Ad Privacy settings again), click on the three-dot menu in the upper right-hand corner of Chrome, then choose <em>Settings</em>. Alternatively, you can enter <em>chrome://settings</em> in the address bar. If these new controls have reached your installation of Chrome, you&rsquo;ll see <em>Ad Privacy</em> in the menu on the left. Clicking on it should make the <em>Ad topics</em>, <em>Site-suggested ads</em>, and <em>Ad measurement</em> sub-options appear.</p>



<div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter"><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container"><ul class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper"><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="Google Chrome Ad Privacy settings" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-2036186" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-10-1.png?w=1200" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="Google Chrome Ad Topics settings" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-2036185" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-9-1.png?w=1200" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="Google Chrome Site-suggested ads settings" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-2036187" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-8-1.png?w=1200" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="Google Chrome Ad measurement settings" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-2036184" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-7-1.png?w=1200" /></figure></li></ul><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause"></a><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white"></div></div></div>



<p><em><sup>This slideshow shows the new Ad Privacy settings in Chrome. Click and drag on desktop or swipe with a finger on mobile to see all the images. </sup></em></p>



<p>As mentioned above, these are all on by default. You&rsquo;ll have to select each setting to toggle them all off. For <em>Ad topics</em> and <em>Site-suggested ads</em>, you can also instead choose to leave them on, but restrict which topics and sites can be used to generate ads.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="dont-forget-googles-other-privacy-settings">Don&rsquo;t forget Google&rsquo;s other privacy settings</h2>



<p>Chrome&rsquo;s new Ad Privacy settings only affect browsing on your PC&mdash;it won&rsquo;t affect ad settings for your Google account or on mobile. You&rsquo;ll have to adjust those separately. For your Google account, head to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://myaccount.google.com/data-and-privacy&amp;xcust=2-2-2036180-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow"><em>https://myaccount.google.com/data-and-privacy</em></a>, then scroll down to <em>Personalized Ads</em>.</p>



<p>You can also take further measures to strengthen your Chrome privacy settings&mdash;ads are just one part of it. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2015312/10-essential-tips-to-make-google-chrome-more-secure.html">Our guide to making Chrome more secure</a> also overlaps with privacy; stuff like managing your cookies and clearing your data if you don&rsquo;t need it also helps keep you more anonymous online. At least, as much as you can be while using Google&rsquo;s services and products.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="crucial-x9-pro-price-design-and-features">Crucial X9 Pro price, design, and features </h2>



<p>Crucial sells the X9 Pro in 1TB/$80, 2TB/$130, and 4TB/$240 capacities. That&rsquo;s not the least expensive 10Gbps SSD on the market, but given superior performance, not bad pricing at all. The 20Gbps Crucial X10 Pro runs around $40 more at each capacity.</p>

<p>The pewter-hued X9 Pro is a svelte object of desire at around 2.56 inches (65mm) long, 1.97-inches (50mm) wide, and only 0.38-inches (9.6mm) thick. </p>



<p>Its bottom (shown below) features a slightly less slippery finish, though I wouldn&rsquo;t exactly describe it as non-slide. The cavity is for lanyards and features a status/activity light inside.</p>

<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-2027733" height="708" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Crucial-X9-Pro-back.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure></div>



<p>The X9 Pro weighs in at a feathery 1.5 ounces and is <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/578310/ip-ratings-explained.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">IP55 rated</a>. That rating indicates that it can ward off enough dust and water spray to keep on ticking. Just don&rsquo;t leave it in your pocket when you go diving. Even in shallow water.</p>



<p>The company warranties the X9 Pro for five years, but doesn&rsquo;t provide TBW (terabytes that can be written) ratings, which are often the mitigating factor in warranty claims. Lack of info or not, companies rarely if ever deny a warranty claim given reasonable use.</p>



<p>Crucial bundles a Type-C to Type-C cable but doesn&rsquo;t include a Type-A adapter. That&rsquo;s okay with 20Gbps drives such as the X10 Pro, which almost always plug into a Type-C port, but a 10Gbps drive like the X9 Pro is far more likely to be used in Type-A ports. Grab one at the checkout counter if need be. </p>



<p>Crucial has promised a utility for September 2023 that will allow you to lock and unlock data on the X9 Pro. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Where the X9 Pro really shone was in the 48GB transfers, easily outpacing both 10Gbps competitors.</p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-does-the-crucial-x9-pro-perform">How does the Crucial X9 Pro perform?</h2>



<p>The X9 Pro didn&rsquo;t place first in the synthetic benchmarks (CrystalDiskMark 8/AS SSD), but it wasn&rsquo;t far off, and led the 10Gbps pack in our real-world 48GB and 450GB transfers. </p>



<p>The 20Gbps is included to show what you get for the extra $40 it costs. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-2027684" height="606" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Crucial-X9-Pro-CDM8-Seq.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This test shows the obvious advantage of the 20Gbps X10 Pro, but the X9 Pro held its own among the 10Gbps drives.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As you can see above, CrystalDiskMark 8 rated the X9 Pro as merely average for a 10Gbps USB SSD.</p>



<p>Random performance (shown below) was also rather average. The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1966408/sk-hynix-beetle-x31-review-speedy-affordable-10gbps-usb-ssd-with-up-to-2tb.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">SK Hynix Beetle X31</a> rules in this department, which does have some effect if you&rsquo;re running an operating system off the drive. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-2027686" height="582" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Crucial-X9-Pro-CDM8-rnd.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">While the X9 Pro turned in good random numbers, the Beetle X31 ruled this test.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Where the X9 Pro really shone was in the 48GB transfers, easily outpacing both 10Gbps competitors. It&rsquo;s not as fast as the X10 Pro, but that&rsquo;s to be expected given its 20Gbps bandwidth.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-2027687" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Crucial-X9-Pro-48GB.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Crucial&rsquo;s X9 Pro smoked the 10Gbps competition in our 48GB transfers. This is as close to real world as tests get.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The X9 Pro shaved a couple of seconds off the Beetle X31&rsquo;s 450GB write time, making it the second-fastest 10Gbps USB SSD we&rsquo;ve tested at this task, behind only OWC&rsquo;s dual-interface (10Gbps/Thunderbolt 3) <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/331884/owc-envoy-pro-fx-ssd-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Envoy Pro FX</a>.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-2027688" height="599" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Crucial-X9-Pro-450GB.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The X9 Pro was a bit faster than the 10Gbps competition in our 450GB write.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="should-you-buy-the-crucial-x9-pro">Should you buy the Crucial X9 Pro?</h2>



<p>Overall, you can&rsquo;t ask much more from a 10Gbps USB SSD than you get with the X9 Pro.</p>



<p>The average user will be more the adequately served by this drive, which delivers good performance at a cheaper price point than the X10 Pro. We do, however, recommend the latter for video mavens and prosumers because of its significantly faster transfers. Time is money. </p>
