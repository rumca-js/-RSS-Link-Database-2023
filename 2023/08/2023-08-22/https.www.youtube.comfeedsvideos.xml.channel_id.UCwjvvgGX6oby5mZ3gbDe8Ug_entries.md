Recently, China's real estate market was hit with another disaster following the collapse of Evergrande. China's No. 1 developer, Country Garden, is rumored to have defaulted on the interest payment of its bond at an amount of US$22.5 million, sending the price of its other bonds plummeting. Trading of its stock was suspended by the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. The market is worried that another real estate crisis is about to hit the market.
