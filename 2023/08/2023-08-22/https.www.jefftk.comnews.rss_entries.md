After a lot of discussions online where people try to argue about
where self-driving tech is going but seem pretty confused about where
the tech currently is, I wanted to give a bit of an overview of the
current state.

<p>

There are two main approaches: taxis and personal vehicles.  There are
many companies that have gotten as far as testing with a safety driver
and/or with "trusted tester" riders, but as far as I can tell only two
companies run commercial ride services open to the public without
anyone in the driver's seat:

<ul>

<li><p><a href="https://waymo.com/">Waymo</a>
(Google-affiliated) has been operating fully driverless vehicles in
Phoenix AZ as a <a href="https://waymo.com/waymo-one/">commercial ride
service</a> since <a href="https://waymo.com/blog/2020/10/waymo-is-opening-its-fully-driverless.html">2020</a>. They
used to have a waitlist, but at this point anyone can download the app
and try it.  They've just expanded to <a href="https://waymo.com/blog/2023/08/waymos-next-chapter-in-san-francisco.html">SF</a>,
and have a <a href="https://waymo.com/waitlist/">waitlist</a> for <a href="https://waymo.com/blog/2022/10/next-stop-for-waymo-one-los-angeles.html">LA</a>
and <a href="https://waymo.com/blog/2023/08/waymo-one-heads-to-austin.html">Austin</a>. As
of <a href="https://waymo.com/blog/2023/08/waymos-next-chapter-in-san-francisco.html">2023-08</a>
they claim to be serving 10k weekly riders.

<li><p><a href="https://getcruise.com/">Cruise</a> (GM-affiliated) has been
operating fully driverless vehicles in SF as a commercial ride service
since <a href="https://getcruise.com/news/blog/2022/were-going-commercial/">2022</a>.
They also now seem to cover <a href="https://getcruise.com/rides/">Austin and Phoenix</a>, and as of
<a href="https://gmauthority.com/blog/2023/08/gms-cruise-now-has-about-400-driverless-vehicles-on-the-road/">2023-08-02</a>
also claim 10k weekly riders.

</p></li>
</ul>

For personal vehicles, the most automation you can currently get is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car#Levels_of_driving_automation">Level
3</a>. These are systems where, when engaged, the person in the
driver's seat can safely and legally read a book or otherwise not pay
attention.  If the system runs into a situation it can't handle, it
alerts the driver, and if the driver doesn't take control it
automatically stops the car.  One option here, and maybe the only
commercially available one, is Mercedes' Drive Pilot, which they
launched in Germany <a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/mercedes-rolls-out-level-3-autonomous-driving-tech-in-germany/">in
2022</a>.  It only operates on highways under 40mph (essentially,
stop-and-go traffic) but Mercedes takes on the legal liability when
it's engaged. They <a href="https://media.mbusa.com/releases/release-1d2a8750850333f086a722043c01a0c3-conditionally-automated-driving-mercedes-benz-drive-pilot-further-expands-us-availability-to-the-countrys-most-populous-state-through-california-certification">claim</a>
their 2024 (as in, starting late this year) US models of their S-class
and EQS sedans will have DrivePilot as an option and are approved in
CA and NV.  There may be other L3 systems in other countries&#8212;I'm
having a lot of trouble telling what exactly launched with what models
and whether it qualifies as L3.

Overall, the current state is beyond "it's just a demo", but it's also
still heavily limited by location and current conditions.
