Caroline Rose’s 2020 album, "Superstar," was poised to take the world by storm when it was released on March 6 of that year … but the global pandemic took away much of the energy surrounding it and all live music in general.

That’s why, in March of 2023, there was a lot of energy around the release of Rose’s latest collection, "The Art of Forgetting." While in the Twin Cities for a show at First Avenue, Caroline Rose visited The Current studio to perform solo versions of two songs from the new album. Watch the performances above.

Songs Performed
00:00:00 Jill Says
00:06:09 Love Song For Myself
Both songs from Caroline Rose’s 2023 album, "The Art of Forgetting," available on @NewWestRecords.

Musician
