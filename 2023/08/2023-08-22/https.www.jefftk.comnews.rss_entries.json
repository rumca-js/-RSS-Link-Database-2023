[{"source": "https://www.jefftk.com/news.rss", "title": "State of Generally Available Self-Driving", "description": "<p><span>\n\nAfter a lot of discussions online where people try to argue about\nwhere self-driving tech is going but seem pretty confused about where\nthe tech currently is, I wanted to give a bit of an overview of the\ncurrent state.\n\n</span>\n\n<p>\n\nThere are two main approaches: taxis and personal vehicles.  There are\nmany companies that have gotten as far as testing with a safety driver\nand/or with \"trusted tester\" riders, but as far as I can tell only two\ncompanies run commercial ride services open to the public without\nanyone in the driver's seat:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p><a href=\"https://waymo.com/\">Waymo</a>\n(Google-affiliated) has been operating fully driverless vehicles in\nPhoenix AZ as a <a href=\"https://waymo.com/waymo-one/\">commercial ride\nservice</a> since <a href=\"https://waymo.com/blog/2020/10/waymo-is-opening-its-fully-driverless.html\">2020</a>. They\nused to have a waitlist, but at this point anyone can download the app\nand try it.  They've just expanded to <a href=\"https://waymo.com/blog/2023/08/waymos-next-chapter-in-san-francisco.html\">SF</a>,\nand have a <a href=\"https://waymo.com/waitlist/\">waitlist</a> for <a href=\"https://waymo.com/blog/2022/10/next-stop-for-waymo-one-los-angeles.html\">LA</a>\nand <a href=\"https://waymo.com/blog/2023/08/waymo-one-heads-to-austin.html\">Austin</a>. As\nof <a href=\"https://waymo.com/blog/2023/08/waymos-next-chapter-in-san-francisco.html\">2023-08</a>\nthey claim to be serving 10k weekly riders.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://getcruise.com/\">Cruise</a> (GM-affiliated) has been\noperating fully driverless vehicles in SF as a commercial ride service\nsince <a href=\"https://getcruise.com/news/blog/2022/were-going-commercial/\">2022</a>.\nThey also now seem to cover <a href=\"https://getcruise.com/rides/\">Austin and Phoenix</a>, and as of\n<a href=\"https://gmauthority.com/blog/2023/08/gms-cruise-now-has-about-400-driverless-vehicles-on-the-road/\">2023-08-02</a>\nalso claim 10k weekly riders.\n\n</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nFor personal vehicles, the most automation you can currently get is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car#Levels_of_driving_automation\">Level\n3</a>. These are systems where, when engaged, the person in the\ndriver's seat can safely and legally read a book or otherwise not pay\nattention.  If the system runs into a situation it can't handle, it\nalerts the driver, and if the driver doesn't take control it\nautomatically stops the car.  One option here, and maybe the only\ncommercially available one, is Mercedes' Drive Pilot, which they\nlaunched in Germany <a href=\"https://www.therobotreport.com/mercedes-rolls-out-level-3-autonomous-driving-tech-in-germany/\">in\n2022</a>.  It only operates on highways under 40mph (essentially,\nstop-and-go traffic) but Mercedes takes on the legal liability when\nit's engaged. They <a href=\"https://media.mbusa.com/releases/release-1d2a8750850333f086a722043c01a0c3-conditionally-automated-driving-mercedes-benz-drive-pilot-further-expands-us-availability-to-the-countrys-most-populous-state-through-california-certification\">claim</a>\ntheir 2024 (as in, starting late this year) US models of their S-class\nand EQS sedans will have DrivePilot as an option and are approved in\nCA and NV.  There may be other L3 systems in other countries&#8212;I'm\nhaving a lot of trouble telling what exactly launched with what models\nand whether it qualifies as L3.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nOverall, the current state is beyond \"it's just a demo\", but it's also\nstill heavily limited by location and current conditions.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid021KSjbxcSAbkn7bm51zoVvAgsAnoH8UDVu3mt1cmsoWLEHtTJ5vgmk9DtNYNXf36dl\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://lesswrong.com/posts/3KdbnsGnzSyiujz7Z\">lesswrong</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/110934739828841091\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/state-of-generally-available-self-driving", "date_published": "2023-08-22T19:26:18.003272+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}]
