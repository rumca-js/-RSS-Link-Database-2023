Fort Solis is an impressive debut for indie studio Fallen Leaf. It touts lofty ambitions with the promise of a high-quality, narrative-driven, cinematic experience, and that’s exactly what it ends up delivering. Driven by a compelling psychological thriller story set in a vividly realized and atmospheric sci-fi setting, Fort Solis will keep you engaged for every minute of its brief 4-hour runtime. 

From its impressive visuals and the excellent audio design to the high production values and the excellent acting performances delivered by the entire cast, there’s a lot to be impressed by in Fort Solis. It might not be what some are looking for from a gameplay perspective, light on actual mechanics as it is, but as a narrative experience, it’s well worth a look.

## RIDE 5 Review - The Final Verdict

Fans of the niche motorbike racing sim genre will undoubtedly flock to Ride 5 with its multitude of performance upgrades. The game truly does offer a quality racing gameplay experience. But what it lacks is depth. Most modern sports games offer a more expansive career mode beyond playing a game or racing a race one right after the other. 

Multilayered progression options, cinematic storytelling, and the ever-powerful option of choice in their driver’s narrative to win the season are all fun, fresh elements in modern sports games that Ride 5 seemingly lacks, or only offers in an overly simplified and unsatisfying way. Ride 5 needs more to keep the series fresh as it barrels forward with new entries.
