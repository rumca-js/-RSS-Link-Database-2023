## Sha’Carri Richardson looks like a champion made better by her mistakes

<p>The American’s thrilling victory in the 100m at the world championships was the culmination of a long journey of transformation</p><p>Sha’Carri Richardson’s arms were already spread in triumph before the race was over, but her Usain Bolt impression didn’t hold. Once she had crossed the finish line, the 23-year-old went from confidence to self-doubt as she searched the stadium scoreboard for her time. And even after her 10.65sec – and her 100m world title – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/21/shacarri-richardson-wins-thrilling-100m-from-outside-lane">was confirmed</a>, she still couldn’t believe what had happened. Neither could anyone else, frankly.</p><p>In Budapest on Monday the American shocked the world, rallying past four of the fastest sprinters in history to win gold on the biggest stage outside the Olympics. This was after she scraped into the final and had to race from the outside lane as a result. Meanwhile, her Jamaican rivals Shericka Jackson and Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce – respectively, the world’s top-ranked sprinter and a 10-time world champion – started their races from the middle of the track, much too far to see Richardson coming. As with Bolt, you can’t help wondering how much faster Richardson’s time could have been if she had run all the way through the tape – especially given her 0.07sec margin of victory. But what could have been hardly detracted from what is: a true redemption story.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/22/shacarri-richardson-world-athletics-championships-100m-victory">Continue reading...</a>

## The Dive review – scuba diving survival thriller goes deep underwater

<p>An race against the clock offers plenty of adrenaline-filled moments, but a weak backstory drains the tension</p><p>This survival thriller puts an underwater twist on 127 Hours, the Danny Boyle movie in which James Franco’s arm gets wedged in a boulder while he’s out hiking. Here, the limb-stuck-in-rock predicament is 30-odd meters below sea level, with an American diver who traps her leg off the coast of Malta. (Plot spoiler: no DIY surgery is involved.) What follows is a race against the clock, cleverly constructed by director Maximilian Erlenwein and co-writer Joachim Hedén. Their script throws in plenty of calamities to nobble the diver’s escape, but didn’t quite manage – for me at least – to spark a vertiginous clammy terror.</p><p>Sophie Lowe and Louisa Krause play sisters Drew and May, driving out to dive in a hire car. Clearly, there’s unspoken conflict between the two. May (Krause) doesn’t know that Drew (Lowe) has been made redundant from her journalism job; they only meet once a year to dive. But it’s older sister May – tough, resourceful, calm – whose leg gets pinned by a boulder when cliff erosion sends great hulks of rock pelting into the sea. She only has 22 minutes of oxygen left.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/22/the-dive-review-scuba-diving-survival-thriller-goes-deep-underwater">Continue reading...</a>
