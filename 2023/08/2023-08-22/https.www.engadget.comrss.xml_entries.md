<p>Internet retailers are receiving questions over their approaches to recalled products. The House Energy and Commerce Committee has <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/posts/e-and-c-bipartisan-leaders-demand-online-marketplaces-divulge-efforts-to-remove-harmful-recalled-products-from-platforms">sent letters</a> to Amazon, Ebay, Meta, Walmart and other online shopping portals asking about their efforts to thwart sales of recalled and banned goods on their platforms. They're particularly concerned that Meta allegedly failed to stop Facebook Marketplace sales of two recalled child products, the Fisher-Price Rock 'n Play sleeper and Boppy Newborn Lounger.</p><p>The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) recalled the Rock 'n Play in 2019, and the Newborn Lounger in 2021. However, it says the takedown request rate (an average of 1,000 per month) hasn't slowed, and that there haven't been any &quot;proactive measures&quot; to bar sales. The Rock 'n Play has been linked to roughly 100 baby deaths. The members of Congress, including committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers, are concerned that online marketplaces may be putting children and all users at risk by doing too little to stop these sales.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The House representatives ask all the companies to detail their current efforts to block sales of recalled products, including the presence of dedicated staff. The politicians also want to know what the companies will do in the future and whether there's any legal uncertainty about how to tackle the problems. The letters ask if the companies are willing to work with the committee on a solution to the problem. The companies have been told to respond no later than August 31st.</p><p>In a statement to Engadget, a Meta spokesperson says that sales of recalled goods aren't unique to Facebook Marketplace. The representative says Meta takes the issue &quot;seriously&quot; and pulls listings that violate its rules. Ebay tells Engadget it takes recalls &quot;very seriously&quot; and uses a combination of AI and investigators to spot potentially unsafe listings. It hoped to work with the House committee on these issues.&nbsp;</p><p>The enquiries come just as Amazon is facing a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-will-reportedly-meet-with-the-ftc-ahead-of-potential-antitrust-lawsuit-190316632.html">potential antitrust lawsuit</a> over its sales practices, and amid greater effort to scrutinize tech giants' behavior. Meta has also been scaling back some of its shopping features, including the shutdowns of live shopping <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-live-shopping-ends-october-2022-202501693.html">on Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-live-shopping-shutdown-205824247.html">Instagram</a>. Those closures are cost-cutting efforts, but they also leave the company's remaining commerce initiatives in a more fragile position.</p><p><strong>Update 8/22 5PM ET:</strong> We've updated the story with a statement from Ebay.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/amazon-meta-and-others-face-scrutiny-for-allowing-sellers-to-list-recalled-products-202005944.html?src=rss

## The best E Ink tablets for 2023

<p>I’ve been a notebook person for most of my life. I’ve had dozens of notebooks over the years that served as repositories for to-do lists, story ideas, meeting scribbles and everything in between. But at a certain point in my adult life, I turned away from physical notebooks because it became easier to save all of those things digitally in various apps that were always available to me on my phone. I sacrificed tactile satisfaction for digital convenience, and a small part of me mourns for all of the half-filled notebooks I left in my wake.</p><p>For some like me, an E Ink tablet may be the solution to those dueling impulses. They can combine the feeling of writing in a regular notebook with many of the conveniences of digitized documents. E Ink tablets allow you to take all of your notes with you on one device, while also letting you scribble with a stylus just like you would with pen-and-paper. Unlike regular tablets and styli, though, E Ink tablets are nowhere near ubiquitous — but there are just enough players in the game to make deciding which one to buy more complicated than you might think. We tested out a bunch of the most popular models available now to see how well they work, how convenient they really are and which are the best tablets using E Ink screens available today.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Are E Ink tablets worth it?</h2><p>An E Ink tablet will be a worthwhile purchase to a very select group of people. If you prefer the look and feel of an E Ink display to LCD panels found on traditional tablets, it makes a lot of sense. They’re also good options for those who want a more paper-like writing experience (although you can get that kind of functionality on a regular tablet with the right screen protector) or a more distraction-free device overall.</p><p>The final note is key here. Most E Ink tablets don’t run on the same operating systems as regular tablets, so you’re automatically going to be limited in what you can do. And even with those that do allow you to download traditional apps like Chrome, Instagram and Facebook, E Ink tablets are not designed to give you the best casual-browsing experience. This is mostly due to the nature of E Ink displays, which have noticeable refreshes, a lack of color and lower quality than the panels you’ll find on even the cheapest iPad.</p><p>Arguably the biggest reason why you <em>wouldn’t</em> want to go with an iPad (all models of which support stylus input, a plethora of reading apps, etc) is because it’s much easier to get distracted by email, social media and other Internet-related temptations. An e-reader is also worth considering if this is the case for you, but just know that most standard e-readers do not accept stylus input. If you like to make notes in the margins of books, underline and mark up PDFs and the like, an e-reader won’t cut it.</p><h2>What to look for in an E Ink tablet</h2><p>I discovered four main things that can really make or break your experience with an E Ink tablet during my testing; first is the writing experience. How good it is will depend a lot on the display’s refresh rate (does it refresh after every time you put pen to “paper,” so to speak?) and the stylus’ latency. Most had little to no latency, but there were some that were worse than others. Finally, you should double check before buying that your preferred E Ink tablet comes with a stylus. Believe it or not, many of them require you to purchase the pen separately.</p><p>The second thing to consider is the reading experience. How much will you be reading books, documents and other things on this tablet? While you can find E Ink tablets in all different sizes, most of them tend to be larger than your standard e-reader because it makes writing much easier. Having a larger display isn’t a bad thing, but it might make holding it for long periods slightly more uncomfortable. (Most e-readers are roughly the size of a paperback book, giving you a similar feeling to analog reading).</p><p>The supported file types will also make a big difference. It’s hard to make a blanket statement here because this varies so much among E Ink tablets. The TL;DR is that you’ll have a much better reading experience if you go with one made by a company that already has a history in e-book sales (i.e. Amazon or Kobo). All of the titles you bought via the Kindle or Kobo store should automatically be available to you on your Kindle or Kobo E Ink tablet. And with Kindle titles, specifically, since they are protected by DRM, it’s not necessarily the best idea to try to <a href="https://www.ebook-converter.com/104-how-to-read-kindle-ebook-kobo.htm">bring those titles over to a third-party device</a>. Unless the tablet supports reading apps like Amazon’s Kindle or the Kobo app, you’ll be limited to supported file types, like ePUB, PDF, MOBI, JPEG, PNG and others.</p><p>Third, most E Ink tablets have some search features, but they can vary widely between models. You’ll want to consider how important it is to you to be able to search through all your handwritten notes and markups. I noticed that Amazon’s and Kobo’s E Ink tablets made it easy to refer back to notes made in books and files because they automatically save on which pages you took notes, made highlights and more. Searching is less standardized on E Ink tablets that have different supported file types, but their features can be quite powerful in their own right. For example, a few devices I tested supported text search in handwritten notes along with handwriting recognition, the latter of which allows you to translate your scribbles into typed text.</p><p>The final factor to consider is sharing and connectivity. Yes, we established that E Ink tablets can be great distraction-free devices, but most manufacturers understand that your notes and doodles aren’t created in a vacuum. You’ll likely want to access them elsewhere, and that requires some form of connectivity. All of the E Ink tablets I tried were WiFi devices, and some supported cloud syncing, companion mobile apps and the ability to export notes via email so you can access them elsewhere. None of them, however, integrate directly with a digital note taking system like Evernote or OneNote, so these devices will always be somewhat supplementary if you use apps like that, too. Ultimately, you should think about what you will want to do with the documents you’ll interact with on your E Ink tablet <em>after</em> the tablet portion is done.</p><h2>Best for most: reMarkable 2</h2><p></p><p>The <a href="https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2">latest reMarkable tablet</a> isn’t topping our list because it’s the most full-featured or even most interesting E Ink tablet we tested. Rather, it provides the best mix of features people will find useful in a device like this. We’ll get into them all, but first, it’s worth mentioning build quality. The reMarkable 2 weighs less than one pound and is one of the sleekest E Ink tablets we tried. It has a 10.3-inch monochrome digital paper display that’s surrounded by beige-colored bezels, with the chunkiest portion at the bottom edge where you’d naturally grip it. There’s a slim silver bezel on the left side, which attaches to accessories like the folio case and the new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/remarkable-2-type-folio-keyboard-hands-on-130057978.html">Type Folio keyboard</a>. Hats off to reMarkable for making an E Ink tablet that feels right at home with all of your other fancy gadgets.</p><p>Let’s start with the writing and reading experiences on the reMarkable 2, both of which are great. From the get go, scribbling, doodling and writing was a breeze. We tested out the Marker Plus, which has a built-in eraser, but both it and the standard Marker are tilt- and pressure sensitive pens, and require no batteries or charging. I observed basically no lag between my pressing down onto the reMarkable 2’s screen and lines showing up. The latency was so low that it felt the closest to actual pen-and-paper. But I will say that this is not unique among our top picks in this guide – almost all of the E Ink tablets we tested got this very crucial feature right.</p><p>When it comes to reading, the reMarkable 2 supports PDFs and ePUBs, and you can add files to the device by logging into your reMarkable account on desktop or via the companion mobile app on your phone. You can also pair your Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive or Dropbox account with your reMarkable account and access files that way as well. That should be good enough for anyone who, say, reads a lot of academic papers or reviews many documents for work. It’ll be harder for people who purchase their ebooks from online marketplaces like the Kindle or Kobo stores, but there are other options for those.</p><p>Another fun way to get documents onto the reMarkable 2 is via the <a href="https://support.remarkable.com/s/article/Read-on-reMarkable-Google-Chrome-Extension">Read with reMarkable extension</a> for Google Chrome. After installing it and pairing your reMarkable account, you’ll be able to send articles you find online directly to your reMarkable 2 so you can check them out later. You can even customize these files to be sent as text only, which will let you change their format directly on your reMarkable, or as a PDF file. Regardless of which you choose, you’ll be able to mark up these articles as you would any other file on the E Ink tablet. I used this extension a lot and I did enjoy reading longform articles on the reMarkable 2 more than on my iPhone. Being able to underline, highlight and otherwise mark up those stories was more of a bonus than a necessity for me, but for others who glean sources from online materials will be better off for it.</p><p>Overall, it’s pretty easy to get files onto the reMarkable 2 and it is possible to access them elsewhere when you may not be able to whip out the E Ink tablet. Those with a reMarkable Connect subscription will have the best experience, and it’s a nice perk that you get a one-year membership when you buy one. The $3-per-month subscription provides the ability to edit existing notes and take new ones from anywhere using the desktop and mobile apps, plus unlimited cloud storage and syncing. On that last front, if you don’t pay for Connect, only “notes and documents synced online in the last 50 days” will be available in reMarkable’s companion apps. I suspect 50 days worth of document syncing will be enough for some, but not power-users. Putting the ability to take notes anywhere behind a paywall is a bit of a bummer no matter what and makes it much harder for anyone to use the reMarkable ecosystem as their main note-taking space.</p><p>That said, I kept most of my testing to the reMarkable 2 itself and was impressed by its ability to be a digital notebook without a steep learning curve. You can create different notebooks and “quick sheets” to organize your handwritten notes, and folders to make sense of imported files. You’ll find eight different brush types with which to mark up documents and take notes, along with customizable line thicknesses and “colors” (which just show up as shades on the tablet itself). You can even type wherever you want in a doc, and the reMarkable 2 can translate handwritten notes into machine-readable text with surprising accuracy.</p><p>It was no shock that the reMarkable 2 ended up having the best mix of features, along with a relatively low learning curve. The company was one of the first on the scene with a truly viable E Ink tablet back in 2017, and they’ve been refining the experience ever since. But that comes at a cost – the reMarkable 2 isn’t the most expensive E Ink tablet we tested, but it’s not cheap either. The tablet alone will set you back $299, and then you’ll have to shell out either $79 or $129 for the Marker or Marker Plus, respectively. In all, you’re looking at $430 for the best version of the reMarkable 2 you can get (and that assumes you skip the new $199 Type Folio Keyboard).

If you’re looking for an E ink tablet that will not take ages to get used to, offers a stellar writing experience and makes it relatively simple to access notes elsewhere, the reMarkable 2 is your best bet.</p><h2>Best e-reader E Ink tablet: Amazon Kindle Scribe</h2><p></p><p>You really have two options in this space: the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9JbnRyb2R1Y2luZy1LaW5kbGUtU2NyaWJlLXRoZS1maXJzdC1LaW5kbGUtZm9yLXJlYWRpbmctYW5kLXdyaXRpbmcvZHAvQjA5QlJaQksxNT90aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXN6LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1N2Y0MTQxMy1lZWMyLTRkOTAtOWMyNS0yNmQxNDRiNzM3YjgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdC0Fw-hbXTKxeT98YDCPi9hN-D3BUxUadt7VDXv3ZKD&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FIntroducing-Kindle-Scribe-the-first-Kindle-for-reading-and-writing%2Fdp%2FB09BRZBK15%3Fth%3D1">Amazon Kindle Scribe</a> and the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3VzLmtvYm9ib29rcy5jb20vY29sbGVjdGlvbnMvZXJlYWRlcnMvcHJvZHVjdHMva29iby1lbGlwc2EtMmUiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjU3ZjQxNDEzLWVlYzItNGQ5MC05YzI1LTI2ZDE0NGI3MzdiOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAeZveHuXrK0VMeYhNin7_ql2ZevRFNROg2Anfxn_pw2H&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fus.kobobooks.com%2Fcollections%2Fereaders%2Fproducts%2Fkobo-elipsa-2e">Kobo Elipsa 2E</a>. The Scribe edged out the Elipsa 2E purely because of its low-latency pen-and-screen combination. The Elipsa has its merits, which we’ll get into in a bit, but it just couldn’t compete with the Scribe when it came to a seamless and smooth handwriting experience.</p><p>We already gave the Kindle Scribe the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-kindle-scribe-review-e-ink-reader-tablet-pen-drawing-price-battery-life-140019784.html">full review treatment</a>, and in general, I enjoyed it while testing it out for this guide, too. As mentioned, there’s little to no latency when writing on the Scribe with its companion pen. Thanks to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kindle-scribe-update-adds-new-brushes-and-better-organization-210011764.html">latest software update</a>, you also have more brush types to choose from now, including fountain pen, marker and pencil, which add to the charm. Like other E Ink tablets, the Scribe makes it easy to create multiple notebooks, and you can add pages to them and change up their templates if you wish.</p><p>As an e-reader, the Scribe shines not only thanks to its 10.2-inch display with auto-adjusting front lights, but also because you have Amazon’s entire ebook store at your fingertips. If you get most of your reading material from Amazon or subscribe to <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9raW5kbGUtZGJzL2h6L3N1YnNjcmliZS9rdT9zaG9wcGluZ1BvcnRhbEVuYWJsZWQ9dHJ1ZSZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1zei0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTdmNDE0MTMtZWVjMi00ZDkwLTljMjUtMjZkMTQ0YjczN2I4In0&amp;signature=AQAAARj6eFOV3M9G1Z8l-1D34ToGloYCJ9BXtTXTUuTYEf76&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fkindle-dbs%2Fhz%2Fsubscribe%2Fku%3FshoppingPortalEnabled%3Dtrue">Kindle Unlimited</a>, you’ll be able to jump right into all of your titles instantly on the Scribe. In addition, the Scribe can connect to Audible via Bluetooth. It’s also easy to get ebooks from your local library and read them on a Kindle. This will be crucial not only for voracious readers, but especially for students who buy or rent digital textbooks and those who consume books regularly for research purposes.</p><p>I thought about students a lot when using the Scribe. I started college in 2009, two years after the first Kindle was released and one year before the first iPad came out. Getting textbooks digitally really wasn’t an option for me – but I can understand the appeal a note-taking device like the Kindle Scribe would have for students. It’s arguably even better than a standard Kindle because its bigger screen size, which will make it less tiring to stare at for long periods of time. Adding the ability to take handwritten notes while you’re studying is icing on the cake.</p><p>However, Amazon’s execution of book notes is not my favorite. You actually cannot take notes in the margins of Kindle ebooks. Instead you press and hold the pen’s tip on the screen to highlight text or add a note to a particular word or phrase. If you do the latter, a window pops up on the bottom half of the screen where you can either take a handwritten note or type a text note using the Scribe’s mildly frustrating and sluggish on-screen keyboard.</p><p>Amazon recently rectified this a bit with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazons-kindle-scribe-updates-include-support-for-direct-on-page-writing-051753157.html">software update</a> that allows for direct on-page writing in certain Kindle books. The Kindle Store now has a section that showcases &quot;Write-on Books,&quot; which is currently mostly made up of journals and game books that feature puzzles like crosswords and sudoku. This is certainly a step in the right direction, but it means you still won't be able to mark up your favorite fiction and non-fiction books until they support the new feature.</p><p>This is where I give a nod to the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3VzLmtvYm9ib29rcy5jb20vY29sbGVjdGlvbnMvZXJlYWRlcnMvcHJvZHVjdHMva29iby1lbGlwc2EtMmUiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjU3ZjQxNDEzLWVlYzItNGQ5MC05YzI1LTI2ZDE0NGI3MzdiOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAeZveHuXrK0VMeYhNin7_ql2ZevRFNROg2Anfxn_pw2H&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fus.kobobooks.com%2Fcollections%2Fereaders%2Fproducts%2Fkobo-elipsa-2e">Kobo Elipsa 2E</a>, where you <em>can</em> write notes in the margins, underline, circle and otherwise mark up your reading material. It’s a more natural (and fun) experience since it mimics what you’d do if you were reading a physical book. It’s a shame that the latency on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kobo-takes-on-the-kindle-scribe-with-improved-elipsa-2e-e-ink-tablet-040148388.html">Elipsa</a> was just a hair more noticeable than that of the Scribe. If it weren’t for that, it might have beaten Amazon’s device here.</p><p>What that extra bit of latency translates to in practice is handwriting that can come out just a bit messier, and that increases precipitously the faster you write. But that also means that you’ll notice this the most when taking notes longhand on the Elipsa; if you’re primarily using an E Ink tablet to mark up documents, it won’t affect you as much. Despite that, I did like the way Kobo executed notebooks on the Elipsa. You can have a standard notebook where you can write and scribble away, or an “advanced” notebook that supports handwriting-to-text conversion and inserting things like diagrams and formulas. Text conversion is actually pretty accurate, too, even when dealing with some of my ugliest handwriting.</p><p>Kobo also has a pretty sizable ebook marketplace, so it’s certainly a decent option if you want to stay clear of the Amazon ecosystem. But Amazon has the upper hand when it comes to price. The Kobo Elipsa 2E pack that includes its stylus is $399, while the 16GB Kindle Scribe with the premium pen (which includes dedicated eraser and shortcut buttons) comes in at $369. Even if you max out the Scribe with 64GB of storage, you’d only spend $20 more than you would on the Kobo Elipsa. That, combined with the Scribe’s strong overall performance and the ubiquity of Amazon’s ebook offerings will make it the better choice for most readers.</p><h2>Best E Ink tablet for note-taking: Supernote X</h2><p></p><p>I spent a while testing all of these E Ink tablets, and the <a href="https://supernote.com/collections/devices/products/supernote">Supernote X</a> is the one I was consistently most excited to use. As a notebook nerd, I find this thing so cool. Available in 10.3-inch (what I tested) and 7.8-inch sizes, the Supernote X has a “FeelWrite” screen protector that has a different feel than a standard E Ink screen. When writing on it with Heart of Metal Pen 2, which is weighty and looks like a fountain pen, you get a gel pen-like feel rather than the subtly scratchy vibe that other E Ink tablets have. In fact, the Supernote X has one of the best writing experiences out of any tablet I tested.</p><p>The Supernote X supports a range of file formats, including PDF, ePUB, Word (.doc), PNG and JPG, which really opens up the content you can put onto the thing. I wanted to see if I could treat it almost like a digital bullet journal, and that wasn’t hard to do. There are built-in page templates, but I was able to download daily, weekly and monthly planner templates online, resize them and move them onto the Supernote X using <a href="https://www.android.com/filetransfer/">Android File Transfer</a>. The device has a dedicated “MyStyle” folder where you can save files you want to use as templates. The most difficult part was making sure I had the dimensions right while resizing the documents. Once saved in the right folder, I could make an entire notebook out of the templates I had gotten from the internet for free.</p><p>Supernote does have its own “app store,” but there’s not much in there, and its Play Store offerings are limited to only the Kindle app. This device doesn’t have a backlight, so it won’t be easy to see in dark environments. But you can download Amazon’s ebook app and read just like you would on a standard tablet (no, you can’t mark up books here either).</p><p>Honestly, the last thing I wanted to do with the Supernote X was read, though. The device really shines as an E Ink notebook and the company clearly put a lot of thought into “building a better mousetrap,” so to speak. You can translate handwritten words into typed text, but you don’t have to do that in order for the software to recognize your handwriting. There’s a keywords feature that lets you basically bookmark important phrases for quick access later. All you need to do is lasso the word, press the keyword button and the tablet’s software will translate your writing into typed text. Then you can add it as a keyword and quickly jump back to it from the left-side tablet of contents menu. Similarly, you can bookmark titles and add stars to pages that are important, all of which help you jump between important bits.</p><p>That said, the Supernote X sometimes felt a little inconsistent. The writing experience was top-notch, but there were other things that felt a little less polished. For example, you can swipe down on the right bezel to bring up a menu that lets you quickly navigate between favorited notes and recent documents – that’s quite thoughtful. But then the Files page just has a couple of starkly named folders like Export, Screenshot and Inbox that I didn’t touch once, and the pen sidebar has more options than most people will know what to do with (and none of them have text labels).</p><p>These are small nit-picks, but they go to show that the Supernote X might not be the best device for tech novices. There is a learning curve here, but notebook nerds like myself will be thrilled with all that the Supernote X has to offer. Unsurprisingly, all those advanced features come at a steep price: the A5-sized tablet with a folio and pen will set you back at least $532, making it the most expensive set on our list.</p><h2>Honorable mention: Boox Note Air 2 Plus</h2><p></p><p>If you removed some of the notebook-specific features from the Supernote X and added in a more complete version of Android 11, you’d get the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Nob3AuYm9veC5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvbm90ZWFpcjIiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjU3ZjQxNDEzLWVlYzItNGQ5MC05YzI1LTI2ZDE0NGI3MzdiOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAdei88kTG0OgbrsP-ZrtuPt--mNsHKxhysGtwxbE3u5z&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.boox.com%2Fproducts%2Fnoteair2">Boox Note Air 2 Plus</a>. Boox makes a number of interesting E Ink devices and the Note Air 2 Plus is the one that best compares to the others on our list thanks to its 10.3-inch display. This is an E Ink Android tablet, so that means you can actually download Android apps like Kindle, Kobo and others. There’s even a web browser, and yes, you can watch videos on this thing, too.</p><p>Of course, just because you can do all of that doesn’t mean you should. E Ink screens are truly best for reading and writing, so I didn’t spend much time binge watching YouTube on the Note Air 2 Plus – but I was happy that I had the freedom to do so. Really, the utility of Android comes in with the app store and I expect that most people will use it to download all of their favorite reading and writing apps. Much like a standard tablet, the Note Air 2 Plus will be a great option for anyone that gets their reading material from a bunch of different places — and since you can manually transfer documents from your computer to the device, too, it’s far-and-away the most versatile option on our list.</p><p>I experienced little to no latency when writing on the Note Air 2 Plus and I was happy with the number of brush options it has. Like the Supernote X, it comes with a bunch of page templates you can use, or you can bring in your own PDFs and other documents to use as templates. There’s an “AI recognition” feature that translates a whole page’s handwriting into typed text, and it’s actually pretty accurate. (Though, it did consistently confuse my “&amp;” for a capital A). I also appreciated that you can add other kinds of material to your notes, including web pages and voice recordings, and share notes as PDFs or PNGs via email, Google Drive and other services. Features like those ensure that, with this partially analog device, you don’t miss out on some of the conveniences that a true digital notebook system would have.</p><p>Instead of going into all of the features the Note Air 2 Plus offers, I think it’s most useful to talk about the value of this device. A bundle with the tablet, a standard pen and a folio case comes in at $500, putting it on the higher end of the price spectrum among the devices we tested. But considering it’s a full Android tablet, that doesn’t seem absurd. Those who want to avoid distractions most of the time while still having access to email and a web browser might gravitate towards a device like this. Also, most of Boox’s devices operate in the same way, so you do have more affordable options if you like this blueprint. For example, the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Nob3AuYm9veC5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvbm92YWFpcjIiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjU3ZjQxNDEzLWVlYzItNGQ5MC05YzI1LTI2ZDE0NGI3MzdiOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfSLLBauv6iap2X84U4Z0Qe4-8_v9LefC7xeba2sFs_R&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.boox.com%2Fproducts%2Fnovaair2">Boox Nova Air 2</a> is a 7.8-inch version of the Note Air 2 Plus, with slightly different RAM and storage specs to match, and its bundle comes in at $370.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html?src=rss

<p>We’ll soon learn if India will be the first nation to nail a soft landing on the moon’s south pole. The Indian Space Research Organisation’s (ISRO) Chandrayaan-3 mission, which launched on July 14th and entered lunar orbit on August 5th, will attempt to touch down on Wednesday at around 8:34AM EDT. It follows Russia’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/russia-heads-to-the-moon-for-the-first-time-in-47-years-203057705.html">attempt to beat India</a> to the punch that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/russias-luna-25-spacecraft-crashes-into-the-moon-093542172.html">ended badly</a>. The ISRO’s live telecast (watch below) is scheduled to begin at 3:50AM EDT.</p><p>The Chandrayaan-3’s Vikram lander will try to touch down near the Moon’s south pole, which is believed to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-21-nasa-confirms-ice-moon-poles.html">contain water ice</a>. It could provide crucial water, oxygen and fuel for future lunar missions and bases. However, touching down could prove challenging as the region is known for rugged terrain and shadowy craters. This mission’s immediate predecessor, the Chandrayaan-2, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-08-india-finds-missing-lunar-lander.html">crashed in 2019</a> as it descended to the lunar south pole.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Chandrayaan-3 uses a “failure-based design” to incorporate lessons from the 2019 “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-03-vikram-lunar-lander-crash-site.html">hard landing</a>.” The new version includes an expanded landing area, software upgrades and more redundant systems to back up potential outages.</p><p>The IRSO’s X (formerly Twitter) account <a href="https://twitter.com/isro/status/1693879632481935555">posted</a> early Tuesday morning, “The mission is on schedule.

## TikTok search results are about to get infested with ads

<p>If there’s one thing we can count on as a species is that people will figure out ways to squeeze ads into every single thing we look at. Case in point? TikTok is <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/business/en/blog/introducing-tiktok-search-ads-toggle"><ins>integrating ads into search results,</ins></a> so you’ll get branded content every time you look for a hashtag, a specific user or anything else. These ads are pulled from sponsored videos hosted on the platform and exist as a way to “further power brand discovery.”</p><p>Some users may find this annoying, but the announcement makes it clear that ads will be relevant to the search query and will be clearly labeled as a sponsored post. Ads will also likely be culled from your interests as represented by prior search queries and all of your various actions on the social media platform. In other words, the algorithm will do what the algorithm already does, but in a new location.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Clicking on a sponsored post will not interrupt your search, which is nice. The ad mirrors the in-feed experience and allows users to continue scrolling through the search results, whether you click on an ad or not. There’s likely to be no shortage of advertisers as TikTok says the feature is automatically enabled for pre-existing merchants. In other words, advertisers have to opt-out of appearing alongside search results.</p><p>Having an ad-free search bar was fun while it lasted, but this move has <a href="https://searchengineland.com/tiktok-tests-search-ads-383234"><ins>been a long time coming</ins></a>. It was something of an inevitability, as competitors like Instagram <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-is-putting-ads-in-search-results-055701214.html"><ins>started doing the same thing</ins></a> earlier this year. It’s worth noting that ads already appear in the regular TikTok feed, nestled between videos posted by folks you actually follow. Don Draper’s search-bar fever dream is rolling out now to global TikTok users.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-search-results-are-about-to-get-infested-with-ads-184446557.html?src=rss

## Little Nightmares III will let you drag a friend through The Nowhere in 2024

<p>Not only does <em>Little Nightmares III</em> exist, but it's also bringing two-player co-op to the series for the first time. <em>Little Nightmares III </em>is due out in 2024, and it's heading to PC, Switch, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. Developers from Supermassive Games announced the new entry in the horror franchise at the very beginning of Gamescom Opening Night Live today.</p><p><em>Little Nightmares III</em> looks like the stuff of dreams, if you're a twisted horror fiend. The game's reveal trailer showcases two shrunken, puppet-like characters named Low and Alone navigating an oversized world filled with terrors — it's kinda like the grimdark version of <em>It Takes Two</em>, at least in this initial video. Players have to make their way past vicious creatures and murderous monsters, and finally make their way out of The Nowhere.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="374aa29ac9a74c74b09beb1d6f60a739"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>Here's how publisher Bandai Namco describes the new game on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/08/22/little-nightmares-iii-introduces-co-op-to-the-franchise/">PlayStation Blog</a>: &quot;Low and Alone are each equipped with their own iconic items that will allow you to solve various puzzles and defend yourself against the new and dangerous challenges that await you. You’ll be able to interact with the world using Low’s<strong>&nbsp;</strong>bow and arrows<strong>&nbsp;</strong>and Alone’s wrench, but you’ll also need your wits, tenacity, and creativity to survive your trip across the Spiral.&quot;</p><p>The game isn't co-op <em>only</em> — it also has a single-player mode, complete with an AI companion.

<p>Atari is teaming up with Plaion on a new retro home console after finally taking a mulligan on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-31-atari-vcs-final-design.html">its last one</a>. The Atari 2600+ pays homage to the original Atari 2600, which delighted children of the disco era starting in 1977, although this remake is based on the four-switch model from 1980. It plays both Atari 2600 and 7800 games. However, most buyers will want to track down physical cartridges as the retro system, which requires them to play, is only bundled with a collection of 10 titles that lacks system standouts like <em>Pac-Man</em>, <em>Frogger</em>, <em>Space Invaders</em> and <em>Pitfall!</em></p><p>The throwback console has been “lovingly recreated to the same specifications as the original,” although it’s only 80 percent of the size. The console’s “plus” features come in the form of an HDMI output and widescreen support. The company says the system has an enlarged cartridge socket to reduce cartridge sticking. The Atari logo also lights up when powered on.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Marketing photo for the Atari CX40+ retro console. The accessory looks identical to the vintage joystick: mostly black with a lone red button and a long stick protruding." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/417f4e30-4108-11ee-87df-0f5f828c677f" style="height: 1444px; width: 2406px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Atari / Plaion</div></figure><p>The system includes a modern remake of the classic Atari CX40 joystick, the CX40+. Although it supports two players, only one stick is bundled. (You can order an extra for $25.) The company says a CX-30 Paddle Controller remake is on its way as well.</p><p>The system’s free games are bundled on a “10 Games in 1” cartridge, including <em>Adventure</em>, <em>Combat</em>, <em>Dodge ‘Em</em>, <em>Haunted House</em>, <em>Maze Craze</em>, <em>Missile Command</em>, <em>RealSports Volleyball</em>, <em>Surround</em>, <em>Video Pinball</em> and <em>Yars’ Revenge</em>. Atari posted a <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0609/3658/5381/files/Atari-2600Plus-Compatibility.pdf">complete list of compatible cartridges</a>. Prospective buyers may want to consider that hunting down physical games (and potentially paying a premium for some) will be part of the journey.</p><p>If the entire affair sounds familiar, that’s because the classic video game maker launched the long-delayed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/atari-vcs-now-available-193329467.html">Atari VCS</a> just over two years ago. But consumer interest in that model seemed to fall off a cliff after the initial excitement, and the company <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/atari-ends-vcs-production-contracts">discontinued</a> the retro console in favor of reorganizing its hardware business while eyeing “a new commercial strategy.” We can only assume we’re seeing the fruit of that today as it partners with Plaion.</p><p>The Atari 2600+ launches “worldwide” on November 17th for $130. (An optional second joystick adds another $25 onto that.) Starting today, the latest mini-retro system is available for pre-order on <a href="https://atari.com/products/atari-2600-plus">Atari’s website</a>.</p><div id="c92a89e8dc6345e9a9940a28b0e33948"></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ataris-2600-is-a-miniature-console-that-plays-2600-and-7800-game-carts-171014464.html?src=rss

## Destiny 2's main storyline comes to an end with 'The Final Shape' on February 27th

<p>After nearly a decade, the main Destiny story arc is nearing its conclusion. Bungie has <a href="https://twitter.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1694017424268369972">revealed</a> that <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> will be available on February 27th, 2024. You're tasked with nothing less than stopping The Witness from remaking the universe, and have to enter the Traveler itself to save the day. As you might guess, this involves both an amped-up story (Bungie has already confirmed the return of Cayde-6) as well as new gameplay mechanics.</p><p>To start, your proximity to the Traveler gives you access to new Light powers, including some that augment the abilities of nearby players. You'll also see new weapons, such as a support rifle that can switch to healing teammates. Enemies can use new powers of their own, too. The company is also rethinking how it tells stories with <em>The Final Shape </em>— instead of four seasons, you'll see three large episodes divided into a trio of smaller acts. There could be a stronger incentive to stick around as the story unfolds, in other words.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="e9211b4c9ed54488865fed0f751d0cdc"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>Bungie is still committed to finishing the current phase, and is kicking off the Season of the Witch this week.

<p>It’s that time of year again. The annual Gamescom trade fair opens its doors today, but you don’t have to be in Germany to participate in the reveals and updates. All of the good stuff <a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en"><ins>is being streamed live,</ins></a> beginning with the opening night event, hosted by Game Awards guru and former Spike TV personality Geoff Keighley. For those of us far from Europe, the event starts streaming at 2PM ET. Watch it right here.</p><div id="656d026c6e5440339d522188f4bef113"></div><p>So what can we expect from the stream? We don’t have to wonder, as <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1693957621844197380"><ins>Keighley took to Twitter/X</ins></a> and dropped a laundry list of titles that’ll receive the spotlight during the event. Expect trailers or updates on forthcoming titles like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/alan-wake-ii-delayed-by-10-days-will-arrive-on-october-27th-150033546.html"><em><ins>Alan Wake 2,</ins></em></a><em> Sonic Superstars, Tekken 8, Mortal Kombat 1</em> and more. You can also expect some information on upcoming DLC content, like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cd-projekt-red-cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-paid-dlc-131510675.html"><em><ins>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty.</ins></em></a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Of course, these high-profile gaming conferences are all about generating buzz, so there should be a surprise or two, beyond the titles mentioned by Keighley. For instance, last year’s opening night showcase dropped a new trailer and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dead-island-2-release-date-trailers-2023-202837958.html"><ins>opened up pre-release orders</ins></a> for <em>Dead Island 2. </em>That title had been stuck in development hell for a decade, so nobody expected that kind of info-dump at Gamescom.&nbsp;</p><p>Gamescom 2023 extends far beyond the opening night. There are more events and streams throughout the week, though many are intended for folks involved in the development side of things, via the affiliated Devcom sibling event. Gamescom is the world’s largest gaming trade fair, measured by exhibition space and the number of visitors.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gamescom-2023-opening-night-stream-watch-it-here-at-2pm-et-170020656.html?src=rss

<p>The Game Awards has grown enormously and has become a much-awaited annual year-end celebration for video game fans around the world since it first took place in 2014. If you're looking forward to watching it this year, you can now fire up your calendars and add a reminder: The 10th annual show is scheduled to stream live from the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles on December 7th, 2023. Just like in the previous years, the event will stream for free across various platforms, including Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, TikTok Live, Steam and X, the website formerly known as Twitter.&nbsp;</p><p>Last year's show was the biggest one yet, with an estimated 103 million viewers tuning in, which was almost 20 million more than 2021's numbers. It also introduced the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-game-awards-2022-date-160007099.html">Best Adaptation category</a>, reserved for projects that translate video games into popular media, like movies, TV shows and books. Plus, Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey, stars of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-last-of-us-finale-sums-up-everything-the-shows-first-season-did-right-134544926.html"><em>The Last of Us</em></a>, which fans were still looking forward to and had yet to premiere back then, attended the event to present an award. The organizers haven't revealed just yet whether they'll have big stars guesting again this year, but they did say that the event will feature musical performances by The Game Awards Orchestra and other artists. Of course, you can expect to see new game trailers and announcements for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-xvi-release-date-040342103.html">launch dates</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-dlc-2023-idris-elba-040650842.html">expansions</a>, among other things.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Geoff Keighley, creator and executive producer of The Game Awards, said: &quot;Each year, we look forward to hosting a show that honors the stand-out games of the year, while also announcing and previewing some of the world’s biggest and most anticipated video games. With so many beloved video game franchises exploring new mediums and developers creating new experiences across platforms, whether in games, television, movies, and beyond, the industry continues to expand in many surprising ways, and we can’t wait to honor the year’s best games and to show viewers around the world what’s next.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-game-awards-2023-will-stream-live-on-december-7th-160040230.html?src=rss

## Microsoft will bring PC Game Pass to NVIDIA's GeForce Now on August 24th

<p>Microsoft is acting on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsofts-pc-game-pass-is-coming-to-nvidias-rival-geforce-now-service-091754446.html">its promise</a> to bring PC Game Pass to NVIDIA's GeForce Now service. The companies have announced that Game Pass and Microsoft Store titles will be available to stream on GeForce Now starting August 24th. Not every title will be playable right away, but this will give Game Pass subscribers access to releases like <em>Deathloop</em> and <em>No Man's Sky</em> through NVIDIA's platform.</p><p>The two companies have been forging a partnership for a while. Microsoft <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-is-putting-xbox-games-on-geforce-now-in-an-attempt-to-win-over-regulators-184818183.html">struck a deal with NVIDIA</a> in February to bring Xbox games to GeForce Now for 10 years, and the first title (<em>Gears 5</em>) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gears-5-is-the-first-xbox-exclusive-to-come-to-geforce-now-130020878.html">arrived in May</a>. Bethesda's first games, including <em>Doom Eternal</em> and the Wolfenstein reboots, surfaced earlier this month. In that sense, PC Game Pass just expands the selection further.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The pact was announced as part of Microsoft's bid to get regulatory approval for its purchase of Activision Blizzard. In theory, this shows that Microsoft won't have unfair dominance over cloud gaming. The company also plans to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-will-sell-activision-blizzard-streaming-rights-to-ubisoft-in-attempt-to-win-uk-approval-075237079.html">sell Activision Blizzard game streaming rights to Ubisoft</a> to address UK officials' concerns, and has been signing smaller cloud deals in recent months.</p><p>It may seem odd to access one streaming service's games through another, but there may be advantages. GeForce Now is aimed at enthusiasts who want maximum visual quality and reduced lag, with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-ge-force-now-ultimate-hands-on-the-enthusiasts-choice-for-cloud-gaming-specs-release-140035365.html">Ultimate tier</a> supporting 4K at 120 frames per second. If your PC and internet connection are up to the task, Game Pass might shine on GeForce Now where it would otherwise be limited.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-will-bring-pc-game-pass-to-nvidias-geforce-now-on-august-24th-151526248.html?src=rss

## Arturia's Acid V is a Roland TB-303, without the headaches

<p>I've been wracking my brain trying to figure out what would be the next vintage synth to get the Arturia emulation treatment. At this point the company has tackled many of the most iconic synths in history, and spent much of last year focused on its original creations like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturias-augmented-brass-plugin-is-built-for-synthwave-and-sci-fi-scores-150043349.html">Augmented series</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-pigments-4-soft-synth-vst-free-update-160036317.html">Pigments</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-efx-fragments-granular-vst-effect-193053457.html">Fragments</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-dist-coldfire-distortion-plugin-204028687.html">Dist Coldfire</a>. We did get a version of the Korg MS-20 in May of 2022 as part of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-v-collection-9-grows-to-32-virtual-instruments-150052024.html">V Collection 9</a>, but otherwise things have been pretty quiet. Well, I feel slightly embarrassed because there was a pretty obvious gap in Arturia's lineup I had overlooked: The <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=e8c90726-6d93-44f8-97b0-21ecdf65b81e&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Reverb&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJlOGM5MDcyNi02ZDkzLTQ0ZjgtOTdiMC0yMWVjZGY2NWI4MWUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9yZXZlcmIuY29tL3Avcm9sYW5kLXRiLTMwMyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYzYzNGI2OTYtNTdhOC00ZDZmLTlkOTEtZTUzODU4NWE2MjMwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAbldR4qyXcrQEt9zlrDXnEcX6wl6iktadmPRjdXYiLSD&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Freverb.com%2Fp%2Froland-tb-303">Roland TB-303</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.arturia.com/products/software-instruments/acid-v/overview">Arturia Acid V</a> is probably one of the simpler instruments the company has made in recent years. In part because the original 303 is a reasonably simple instrument. It's a bass machine — monophonic with a single oscillator, a 24db lowpass filter and an envelope generator to manipulate the filter. That's kind of it. What made it special was its odd squelchy sound that, when paired with the slides in its sequencer, produced something totally unique and became the core of acid house, hence the name Acid V.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Arturia Acid V's effects section." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/9063df11-40fa-11ee-9d7b-ad3d3ed06316" style="height: 1702px; width: 2200px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Arturia</div></figure><p>As usual the company does a solid job bringing the TB-303's physical interface into a virtual space. But we all know Arturia can't stop there. There's the customary advanced tab. This is where you'll find the three modulation sources which go well beyond your standard LFO, the dedicated effects section (where you can combine up to four effects) and the sequencer.</p><p>The sequencer on the 303 is part of what granted it squelchy super powers, it was also notoriously annoying to program. Thankfully Arturia recognizes that it's 2023 and there's no need to saddle its VST with some arcane 16-step logic puzzle in the name of authenticity. There's a pretty straightforward piano roll interface, with toggles under each step for slide, accent and vibrato. Across the top you can shift individual notes down an octave, up an octave or up two octaves, to get that signature jump that almost any good 303 bassline has.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="Arturia Acid V's sequencer." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/9063b800-40fa-11ee-be6f-451666ba6a98" style="height: 1702px; width: 2200px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Arturia</div></figure><p>On the left you can lock the sequencer into a particular scale to simplify things, add swing, change the sequence length (up to 64 steps) and even generate random sequences. You can easily shift sequences up or down a note chromatically or to the left and right to change the note order. And there's even a polymetric option that allows you to change the sequence length of the notes, slides, vibrato and accents individually. This gives you a lot of power to build something that's constantly evolving, especially if you're taking use of the full 64 steps. Oh, and if that's not enough there are different playback modes so you can pingpong through a sequence, play it backwards or just bounce around randomly.&nbsp;</p><p>Arturia didn't save all the upgrades for the advanced tab, though. The main instrument has added a few welcome amenities, including a sub oscillator with three selectable waveforms which gives the Acid V more oomph than the original ever had. Next to that you'll find the vibrato controls and then the dedicated distortion circuit. One of the most common tricks used on the 303 was to overdrive it into oblivion, and Arturia puts 14 algorithms at your fingertips for doing that. Some are better than others. For example, the crusher is fine, but there's a better bit crushing option in the effects section. And the destroy algorithm fails to live up to its name. Still, the tape, soft clip and overdrive are excellent.</p><figure><img alt="Arturia Acid V's " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/9063df10-40fa-11ee-bf9f-7f4c184d2103" style="height: 1321px; width: 2200px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Arturia</div></figure><p>Acid V goes a step beyond typical modern amenities. There's a little arrow over the name of the instrument in the top right hand corner, and if you click that you're in effect "opening" the machine. Here you'll find virtual trim pots for adjusting things like the pulse width of the square wave, the cutoff range of the filter, the pitch tracking off the filter, clipping level and even a bass boost knob.</p><p>Of course, all the features in the world don't matter if the instrument sounds terrible. But, there was never much concern about that, honestly. Arturia has been in the game for a long time now delivering excellent quality plugins that a misstep would be a true shock at this point.&nbsp;</p><p>I've never played an original TB-303, but I did briefly own a Behringer clone and I've tested the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=e54dc56f-69db-417f-9610-572a1a179058&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sweetwater+Sound&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJlNTRkYzU2Zi02OWRiLTQxN2YtOTYxMC01NzJhMWExNzkwNTgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3dlZXR3YXRlci5jb20vc3RvcmUvZGV0YWlsL1RCMDMtLXJvbGFuZC10Yi0wMy1iYXNzLWxpbmUtc3ludGhlc2l6ZXIiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImM2MzRiNjk2LTU3YTgtNGQ2Zi05ZDkxLWU1Mzg1ODVhNjIzMCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAVlyssLDIWRUbYpDsQd9XT9L8ht5SiOmInR64XHU1PGF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sweetwater.com%2Fstore%2Fdetail%2FTB03--roland-tb-03-bass-line-synthesizer">Roland Boutique TB-03</a>. The Acid V compares pretty favorably to those. Being an actual analog synth, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=e54dc56f-69db-417f-9610-572a1a179058&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sweetwater+Sound&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJlNTRkYzU2Zi02OWRiLTQxN2YtOTYxMC01NzJhMWExNzkwNTgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3dlZXR3YXRlci5jb20vc3RvcmUvZGV0YWlsL0JlaHJURDNTUi0tYmVocmluZ2VyLXRkMy1zaWx2ZXIiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImM2MzRiNjk2LTU3YTgtNGQ2Zi05ZDkxLWU1Mzg1ODVhNjIzMCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATeHqTEEV1P9i5r7VlK76iAqHib-EyrUCuELAZCA5eqz&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sweetwater.com%2Fstore%2Fdetail%2FBehrTD3SR--behringer-td3-silver">Behringer's TD-3 </a>does sound slightly warmer than Acid V and the TB-03, but in the context of an actual song I think you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference between the three. And, as much as I love a good piece of hardware, if I had to choose between the three I'd probably opt for Arturia's plug in just because it's so much easier to use and has infinitely more sequencing versatility.&nbsp;</p><p>Arturia Acid V is available now at an introductory price of $99. Or you can get it free when you buy the entire V Collection for $599, though, you're probably better off waiting for that to go on sale.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/arturias-acid-v-is-a-roland-tb-303-without-the-headaches-150035249.html?src=rss

<p>Basketball season is fast approaching, and so is a new opportunity to virtually get in on the action: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nba-2k24-arrives-on-september-8th-with-ps5-xbox-crossplay-140046497.html"><em>NBA 2K24 New Gen</em></a>. 2K shared preliminary information about the game in July but has just announced new details about September 8th's <em>NBA 2K24</em>, including adding a LeBron Era. This new mode follows LeBron James' 2010 journey of leaving the Cleveland Cavaliers to play for the Miami Heat and leads into the already existing Modern Era. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nba-2k23-michael-jordan-league-pass-2k-sports-140059388.html"><em>NBA 2K23</em></a> also introduced the Magic vs. Bird Era, Jordan Era and Kobe Era to the game.&nbsp;</p><p>Another potentially exciting eras update (if you like being reminded about the passage of time) is an aging feature, which shows the athletes growing older as you play across a person's career. Other new era additions include curated reactions from spectators and journalists, depending on the time period you're in. After a game, you'll also see an article sharing a summary of your match — initially as a newspaper and, as time passes, a social media webpage.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>NBA 2K24</em> should also reflect aspects of the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) reached by the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association and currently in place through the 2029 to 2030 season. These include each <a href="https://www.engadget.com/usa-basketball-national-esports-team-115523916.html">NBA team</a> being positionless and shifting the Restricted Free Agent Right of Refusal Period to 24 hours.&nbsp;</p><p><em>MyNBA</em> online has some updates as well, including a range of roles for you to take on: commissioner, admin, gameplay tuner, time manager, designer, appearance editor or attribute editor. Each position has specific tasks, such as the designer, who can make and change logos, arenas and jerseys. Plus, there's now <em>MyNBA Lite</em> which removes some of the steps typically required for gameplay, such as CBA restrictions and scouting.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/nba-2k22-candace-parker-wnba-women-athletes-201058024.html">WNBA</a> gameplay also has new features coming on <em>NBA 2K24</em>, such as the ability to start as either a college basketball star or an up-and-comer. There's also &quot;In Pursuit of Greatness,&quot; which has you play against rival players to be the best. These games, and those against a veteran of your team or a historic all-star player, allow you to earn badge perks. You can use these rewards to get updated 2K Breakthrough Skins and MyTEAM Jersey Cards.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/nba-2k24-introduces-a-lebron-era-and-more-updates-140015258.html?src=rss

<p>Now's a good moment to get a smartwatch that can easily handle your end-of-summer hikes. Amazon is selling the Apple Watch Ultra with a green Alpine Loop at a new all-time low price <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BcHBsZS1DZWxsdWxhci1UaXRhbml1bS1QcmVjaXNpb24tRXh0cmEtTG9uZy9kcC9CMEJESkJRUlg1Lz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby0xdWEtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjMxZTg2OTE3LWZmNmYtNDI1ZC05ZDY5LWQxYzI0NzE1NTViYiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAcjOHJI4Q1McAu52Kdo-BlRuPKptTGtDmyo8RGu3bxFV&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-Cellular-Titanium-Precision-Extra-Long%2Fdp%2FB0BDJBQRX5%2F">of $700</a>, or $100 off, after a checkout voucher.

The large, extra-bright screen makes it easy to read even in direct sunlight, and the added water resistance is helpful for recreational dives. The action button also comes in handy for marking hike waypoints or starting the next leg of a run. And it's hard to ignore the extra battery life — this watch can last an entire weekend without a charge, depending on how you use it.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You'll need an iPhone to even consider the Apple Watch Ultra, of course. Its size may also be off-putting if you have thin wrists or simply prefer sleeker timepieces. There's also the question of timing — Apple might introduce a refreshed Ultra at an event that could be just weeks away.

<p>Though it's not quite ready to usher in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/why-humans-cant-use-natural-language-processing-to-speak-with-the-animals-143050169.html">Doolittle future we've all been waiting for</a>, modern AI translation methods are proving more than sufficient in accurately transforming humanity's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/metas-open-source-speech-ai-recognizes-over-4000-spoken-languages-161508200.html">roughly 6,500 spoken and written communication systems</a> between one another. The problem is that each of these models tends to only do one or two tasks really well — translate and convert text to speech, speech to text or between either of the two sets — so you end up having to smash a bunch of models on top of each other to create the generalized performance seen in the likes of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-translate-context-ai-ios-redesign-184840667.html">Google Translate</a> or Facebook's myriad language services.&nbsp;</p><p>That's a computationally intensive process, so Meta developed a single model that can do it all. SeamlessM4T is &quot;a foundational multilingual and multitask model that seamlessly translates and transcribes across speech and text,&quot; Meta's blog from Tuesday reads. It can translate between any of nearly 100 languages for speech-to-text and text-to-text functions, speech-to-speech and text-to-speech supports those same languages as inputs and outputs them in any of 36 others tongues, including English.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In their blog post, Meta's research team notes that SeamlessM4T &quot;significantly improve[s] performance for the low and mid-resource languages we support,&quot; while maintaining &quot;strong performance on high-resource languages, such as English, Spanish, and German.&quot; Meta built SeamlessM4T from its existing PyTorch-based multitask UnitY model architecture, which already natively performs the various modal translations as well as automatic speech recognition. It utilizes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model)">BERT 2.0 system</a> for audio encoding, breaking down inputs into their component tokens for analysis, and a <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/c5d736809766d46260d816d8dbc9eb44-Paper.pdf">HiFi-GAN unit vocoder</a> to generate spoken responses.&nbsp;</p><p>Meta has also curated a massive open-source speech-to-speech and speech-to-text parallel corpus, dubbed SeamlessAlign. The company mined &quot;tens of billions of sentences&quot; and &quot;four million hours&quot; of speech from publicly available repositories to &quot;automatically align more than 443,000 hours of speech with texts, and create about 29,000 hours of speech-to-speech alignments,&quot; per the blog. When tested for robustness, SeamlessM4T reportedly outperformed its (current state-of-the-art) predecessor against background noises and speaker style variations by 37 percent and 48 percent, respectively.</p><p>As with most all of its previous machine translation efforts — whether that's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-and-microsoft-release-llama-2-an-ai-language-model-for-commercial-use-163615807.html">Llama 2</a>, Massively Multilingual Speech (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/metas-open-source-speech-ai-recognizes-over-4000-spoken-languages-161508200.html">MMS</a>),  Universal Speech Translator (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/metas-ai-translator-can-interpret-unwritten-languages-150001511.html">UST</a>), or the ambitious <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-wants-to-build-a-universal-language-translator-182519805.html">No Language Left Behind</a> (NLLB) project — SeamlessM4T is being open-sourced. &quot;we believe SeamlessM4T is an important breakthrough in the AI community’s quest toward creating universal multitask systems,&quot; the team wrote. &quot;Keeping with our approach to open science, we are excited to share our model publicly to allow researchers and developers to build on this technology.&quot; If you're interested in working with SeamlessM4T for yourself, head over to <a href="https://github.com/fairinternal/seamless_communication">GitHub to download the model</a>, training data and documentation.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/metas-new-multimodal-translator-uses-a-single-model-to-speak-100-languages-133040214.html?src=rss

## The best mobile microphones for 2023

<p>If you consider yourself a mobile creator and you’re <em>not</em> using some sort of dedicated microphone, you might be holding yourself back. We’re not judging, but your audience likely is. Audio, especially dialog, is often overlooked, but you need good sound quality if you want your content to stand out. There are many, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/advanced-podcast-buyers-guide-part-1-143053492.html">many options</a> for the home or office/studio, but there are a surprising amount of mobile-specific (or at least, mobile-friendly) solutions out there to elevate your on-the-go recordings be that for social, a jam session, live streaming, making movies, podcasting and beyond.</p><p>What “the best mic for iOS or Android” is will vary depending on the task you need it for. If you want to record a TikTok or a podcast or even a jam session, all have slightly different needs but the selection below covers most bases (and maybe even a few you didn’t think of yet) for recording high-quality sound with little more than a mobile phone.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>The gear</h2><p>This guide is all about recording audio on the go, free from the constraints of a studio or office, but also far away from luxuries like power outlets, acoustically friendly rooms and a full-size PC. As such there are two styles of external mic that really shine here: Lavalier (lapel) and shotgun. We’ll be covering a few other types, too, but between those, most tasks are covered.</p><p>We’ll also show you how you can use the USB mics you may already have with your phone and even ways to connect heavy-duty studio classics (XLR) to your humble handset, but all that will be through accessories. For now, let’s start with the classic clip mics.</p><figure><img alt="Pictured are the Sennheiser XS and Rode Lavalier II microphones." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-03/99565600-a076-11ec-bf7f-a5450f59bc2e" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><h2>Lavalier mics</h2><p>The obvious benefit of a lapel microphone is size. Their small profile makes them perfect for presenting to the camera with the flexibility to move around while maintaining consistent audio quality. If you’re a budding TikTok or vlogger it’s definitely worth having one of these mini microphones in your bag.</p><p>The main trade-off, however, is that they’re only good for recording the person they’re attached to. If you have two people talking and only one is wearing the mic, you’ll only get good audio for one half of the conversation, so for multi-person recordings you’ll need a mic for each guest and a way to record them at the same time, so costs can go up quickly.</p><p>Fortunately, lapel mics have become a very competitive market with good, viable options costing as little as $14.95. For an absolute bargain with a long cord and some connectivity accessories, the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2Ftem4udG8vM3RjdmRVZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMDdjOTQ2N2YtOGZhMC00YjMyLTk2MzMtMzk5Yzg0MTcxM2U1In0&amp;signature=AQAAAa68wyd5cRcEhbqUPMUqpNnO3DmbaVf4yZ0W8ZlQxDwd&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Famzn.to%2F3tcvdUe">Boya BY M1</a> is hard to argue with. But, while these budget choices are great value, if you want something that should either last longer, is more versatile or just sounds better it’s worth paying a little bit more.</p><h2>Best 3.5mm mic: Rode Lavalier II</h2><p></p><p><a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=e54dc56f-69db-417f-9610-572a1a179058&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sweetwater+Sound&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJlNTRkYzU2Zi02OWRiLTQxN2YtOTYxMC01NzJhMWExNzkwNTgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3dlZXR3YXRlci5jb20vc3RvcmUvZGV0YWlsL0xhdmFsaWVySUktLXJvZGUtbGF2YWxpZXItaWktYmxhY2siLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjA3Yzk0NjdmLThmYTAtNGIzMi05NjMzLTM5OWM4NDE3MTNlNSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfnJ3HjL80ZkWe1qn1bLLOhgrVOdtf_20cmcWezrazao&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sweetwater.com%2Fstore%2Fdetail%2FLavalierII--rode-lavalier-ii-black">Rode’s Lavalier II</a> is a slick-looking low-profile lavalier that sounds great.

Simply put, 3.5mm TRS is what you might know as the age-old classic headphone jack while TRRS became common for its support for headsets and inline mics. You can easily tell them apart as TRS connectors have two black bands on them while a TRRS has three.</p><p>For you, the budding creator, it can be a bit of an annoyance as many 3.5mm lavaliers are going to be TRS and won’t work when plugged into your phone’s headphone adapter.

More important than aesthetics, though, is how it sounds and the MKE 400 records very cleanly without obvious coloration to the audio. What’s more, the battery-powered mic won’t steal power from your phone or camera, and with three gain levels to choose from you can boost things when needed, or avoid clipping on louder subjects. The MKE 400 also comes with both TRS and TRRS cables for compatibility with a variety of devices.</p><p>The MKE 400’s physical gain controls and high pass filter (unlike the other two below that are updated via an app) take the stress out of worrying if your audio source moves or changes volume as you can adjust that on the fly.

## NVIDIA's DLSS 3.5 makes ray traced games look better with AI

<p>Last year, NVIDIA unveiled DLSS 3 with frame interpolation, which used its AI-driven rendering accelerator to add extra frames to games. Now at Gamescom it's introducing DLSS 3.5, which adds Ray Reconstruction, a new feature that will use the company's neural network to improve the quality of ray traced images. It'll be available for all RTX GPUs—unlike DLSS 3's frame interpolation, which only works with RTX 40-series cards.</p><p>NVIDIA says Ray Reconstruction will replace &quot;hand-tuned denoisers with an NVIDIA supercomputer-trained AI network that generates higher-quality pixels in between sampled rays.&quot; That's similar to NVIDIA's original pitch for DLSS — making low-res textures look better thanks to AI — and it could potentially lead to better ray tracing performance as well. In images shown to media, Ray Reconstruction appears to deliver sharper reflections and textures in supported titles. (See comparisons below.)</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to the company, <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>in Overdrive Mode (its most powerful ray tracing offering) hit 108 fps with DLSS 3.5 and Ray Reconstruction, while the same system reached 100fps with DLSS 3 alone, 63fps with DLSS 2 (which lacks Frame Generation) and 20fps without any DLSS help.</p><p>Just like previous DLSS releases, developers will have to manually implement support for Ray Reconstruction. <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> (and its expansion <em>Phantom Liberty) </em>will be the first DLSS 3.5 title in September, followed by <em>Portal RTX </em>and <em>Alan Wake 2</em>. NVIDIA will be showing off Ray Reconstruction at Gamescom this week, and hopefully we'll get a look ourselves sometime soon.</p><div id="469db00fbc024d35a5eb03e60cccefb9"></div>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/nvidias-dlss-35-makes-ray-traced-games-look-better-with-ai-130012143.html?src=rss

<p>Valve may not have touched the Half-Life franchise in over a decade apart from releasing its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-23-half-life-alyx-review-valve-vr.html">VR-only game <em>Alyx</em></a>, but that isn't stopping enthusiasts from giving the game a visual overhaul.

The team isn't just adding ray tracing, though — this is an attempt to modernize the overall look and feel of the game.</p><p>The ray-traced lights are the star attraction, of course, but the modders are also using an early version of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-drops-remake-of-fan-favorite-mod-portal-prelude-on-steam-for-free-130050799.html">RTX Remix</a> to add extra model detail (through Valve's Hammer editor) and rework materials with physical-based rendering properties. The result is what you'd expect. Where the original <em>Half-Life 2</em> graphics look flat and otherwise dated, the RTX port is moodier and far more detailed. You might want to spend extra time  inspecting Dr. Kleiner's desk or the pet headcrab Lamarr. Not surprisingly, the refresh makes use of additional NVIDIA tech like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-dlss-3-ada-lovelace-160404110.html">DLSS 3</a> upscaling, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-reflex-input-lag-202333860.html">Reflex</a> anti-lag and RTX IO GPU-accelerated storage.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The project is only just getting started, and there's no tentative release date.

## The best immersion blenders you can buy in 2023
 - [https://www.engadget.com/best-immersion-blenders-150006296.html?src=rss](https://www.engadget.com/best-immersion-blenders-150006296.html?src=rss)

<p>While countertop blenders have been staple kitchen tools for quite some time, smaller and more compact immersion blenders (aka hand blenders or stick blenders) have their uses too. They’re great for quickly whipping up a sauce or making a smoothie before you run out the door. Personally, my favorite way to use one is to make light, frothy matcha lattes (just blitz about a cup of milk, half a teaspoon of matcha powder and a splash of simple syrup and optionally pour it over ice), which is faster and easier to do with an immersion blender than their big countertop brethren. And for blending soups or emulsifying sauces, immersion blenders not only give you a lot of control over consistency, they also make cleanup a breeze. But depending on what the rest of your kitchen tech looks, it can get a little confusing when it comes to picking the best immersion blender for your needs. So let us give you a hand with our picks for the best models on the market right now.</p><h2><br />Which device is right for you?</h2><p>Before you even think about buying a new kitchen appliance, it’s important to figure out how you’re going to use it and where it fits in with any gadgets you already own. In an ideal world, everyone would have a dedicated food processor, countertop blender and a stand mixer. But the reality is that many people don’t have the room or the budget.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Engadget's favorite immersion blenders are the Breville Control Grip, the KitchenAid Cordless Variable Speed Hand Blender and the Hamilton Beach 2-Speed Hand Blender

 </div></figure><p>While handheld blenders and traditional, full-size blenders have a lot of overlap, there are strengths and weaknesses to both. For example, if you’re looking to make smoothies every day, a countertop blender might be a better choice. The bigger pitchers make it easier to blend drinks for multiple people at once, while larger motors will make short work of ice and frozen fruit. Additionally, more expensive options like those from Vitamix, All-Clad, Ninja or Robocoupe can even cook soup during the blending process using the heat generated from the blender’s motor, which isn’t something you can do with an immersion model. I’d even go so far as to say that if you have the space for it and don’t already own one, a regular blender is probably the best option for most people.</p><p>That said, immersion blenders are often less expensive and, thanks to a wide variety of accessories offered by some manufacturers, they can be great multitaskers. A whisk attachment allows you to make whipped cream or meringues quickly without needing an electric hand mixer, or risk getting tendonitis in your elbow doing it manually. Some immersion blenders also come with food processing bowls, so you can easily throw together things like small batches of hummus, salad dressings or homemade pesto in minutes. And because immersion blenders are smaller and less bulky than traditional models, they're a great choice for apartment dwellers or anyone with limited storage or counter space. That means if you’re simply trying to expand your culinary repertoire without blowing up your budget, an immersion blender can be a great way to try something new without committing too hard.</p><h2>Corded or cordless?</h2><p>Similar to figuring out if you should get a blender or not, trying to decide between a corded or cordless model depends a lot on the other gadgets you already own. Corded versions typically have more powerful motors, which makes them great for people who don’t have a countertop blender or food processor. But if you do own one of both of those, cordless is the way to go. Not only do you get the convenience of not worrying about wires, but the ease of use makes it fast and easy to whip out your immersion blender to add some extra texture to a sauce, or puree a large pot of soup without having to do it in batches.</p><h2>A quick word about safety</h2><figure><img alt="The most important safety tip for immersion blenders is to always keep the blade pointed down and away from you.

 </div></figure><p>No one should be ashamed of being nervous around a device that is essentially a motorized blending wand with a spinning blade at the end. But with proper care and use, an immersion blender doesn’t have to be much more dangerous than a chef’s knife. The most important safety tip is to make sure you always keep the sharp blades pointed down and away from you or anyone else nearby. That includes your hands, along with any utensils (like a spoon), that might be in or around your mixing bowl.</p><p>Thankfully, all consumer immersion blenders are designed to prevent their blade from directly hitting the vessel holding your food (be it a mixing bowl or a pot). However, to be extra safe, you should avoid blending things in glass containers or nonstick cookware, as glass can chip or shatter while the metal blades and shroud of an immersion blender can damage teflon and ceramic.</p><figure><img alt="Immersion blenders are extremely useful kitchen gadgets, especially when it comes to making creamy soups like this roasted cauliflower chowder. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-05/ee5a0560-d2ea-11ec-a7bf-96fd2a31d9bb" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">

 </div></figure><p>You’ll also want to make sure you keep water away from the plug or outlet of corded immersion blenders. And if you want to remove the blade or clear away any food that might have gotten tangled, first make sure the blender is off, disconnected from its power source (either its battery or wall socket) and in safety mode with a lock button or other feature.</p><p>On the bright side, cleaning an immersion is rather simple and straightforward. All you have to do is fill up a bowl or cup with soapy water, submerge the immersion blender, and then run it for 10 to 20 seconds. That’s it. If it’s still not clean, you can repeat that process again until it is. And if hand washing is too much work, the blending wand on a lot of models (including all of the ones on this list) are dishwasher safe too.</p><h2>Best wired immersion blender: Breville Control Grip</h2><p></p><p>Starting at $130, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9CcmV2aWxsZS1CU0I1MTBYTC1Db250cm9sLUltbWVyc2lvbi1CbGVuZGVyL2RwL0IwMDRSRjdRSlc_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tNW4tMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjIzMzA3OTA4LWYzZWQtNDQ3OC04ZjljLWNkMTQxOTQzYTYzOSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAASzjazopjmGcQ_rKLfey691TiV5mXnKpeowRlAANKGP0&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBreville-BSB510XL-Control-Immersion-Blender%2Fdp%2FB004RF7QJW">Breville’s Control Grip</a> not only has one of the most powerful motors (280-watts) available on a corded immersion blender in this price range, it also comes with a wealth of handy accessories. In addition to the main 8-inch shaft/immersion blade, the kit features a 25-ounce chopping bowl for cutting and mincing and a 42-ounce blending jug for making soups and smoothies. There’s also a whisk attachment, which means that between all of its accessories, the Control Grip can take the place of three different common kitchen gadgets: a food processor, traditional blender and hand mixer.</p><p>I also appreciate the two-button attachment system, a safety feature that ensures accessories are properly locked in before use. Breville even includes a removable blade guard to help prevent the stainless steel blender from scratching your other appliances in storage. And with support for 15 different high speed settings, it has a lot of versatility and can handle all sorts of dishes. Alternatively, if you’re looking for an all-purpose immersion blender with even more attachments for making drinks and pureeing soup, you may want to consider <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9LaXRjaGVuQWlkLUtIQjI1NjFDVS01LVNwZWVkLUhhbmQtQmxlbmRlci9kcC9CMDA1UUlZS1ZHP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTVuLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyMzMwNzkwOC1mM2VkLTQ0NzgtOGY5Yy1jZDE0MTk0M2E2MzkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAaMM70WrkPEgiEPvs5w6U1E0jsgp0FInlSUefQ2Og6PF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FKitchenAid-KHB2561CU-5-Speed-Hand-Blender%2Fdp%2FB005QIYKVG">KitchenAid’s 5-Speed Hand Blender</a>, which comes with two extra bell blades to help crush ice, whisk egg whites and more.</p><h2>Best cordless immersion blender: KitchenAid Cordless Variable Speed Hand Blender</h2><p></p><p>If you just want an immersion blender that’s simple and easy to use, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9LaXRjaGVuQWlkLUtIQkJWNTNCTS1Db3JkbGVzcy1CbGVuZGVyLUJsYWNrL2RwL0IwOEJSMzk0OUc_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tNW4tMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjIzMzA3OTA4LWYzZWQtNDQ3OC04ZjljLWNkMTQxOTQzYTYzOSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAVkclLgVtsqDFGIJt5xJ6G6WXgECF8-BYLvD9Le-nNON&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FKitchenAid-KHBBV53BM-Cordless-Blender-Black%2Fdp%2FB08BR3949G%3F">KitchenAid’s Cordless Variable Speed Blender</a> is the one to get. It comes with a dishwasher-safe blending jar and an optional pan guard to help ensure you won’t nick your cookware. However, the real nifty feature is that instead of having discrete speed settings, you can adjust the blender’s 180-watt motor simply by squeezing down on the trigger. This makes using it incredibly intuitive, and thanks to its built-in safety switch, it’s much more difficult to hit the power button and spin up the blade by accident.</p><p>KitchenAid also claims the battery can blend up to 25 bowls of soup on a single charge. And while my kitchen is too small to test this properly, I never ran into any issues. That said, you’re going to want to make sure to top off its battery beforehand because its charging port is next to where you attach the blending arm, which means you can’t have it plugged in while it's running.</p><h2>Best budget immersion blender: Hamilton Beach 2-Speed Hand Blender</h2><p></p><p>For those who want something that’s versatile and a great value, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9IYW1pbHRvbi1CZWFjaC01OTc2NS1TcGVlZC1CbGVuZGVyL2RwL0IwMDNOUUU4QjA_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tNW4tMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjIzMzA3OTA4LWYzZWQtNDQ3OC04ZjljLWNkMTQxOTQzYTYzOSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYjO1A19rTH4uRq6RNiX7vNRkj6ilhEI0OSP0mMNs0Hz&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHamilton-Beach-59765-Speed-Blender%2Fdp%2FB003NQE8B0%3F">Hamilton Beach’s Two-Speed Hand Blender</a> is a top pick. While it isn’t cordless, in addition to the main blending arm you also get a whisk attachment and a chopping bowl – all for just $35. On top of that, its 225-watt motor is rather powerful for its price, though you don’t get as many speed settings as you would on more premium rivals. With this thing having been on the market for more than 15 years, this blender has long been a top choice among budget-conscious cooks.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-immersion-blenders-150006296.html?src=rss

## Facebook and Instagram will offer chronological Stories and Reels to comply with EU law

<p>Meta will soon offer Stories and Reels in chronological order, among other changes, to comply with the European's Digital Services Act (DSA), the company <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/08/new-features-and-additional-transparency-measures-as-the-digital-services-act-comes-into-effect/">announced</a>. The changes were expected after the European Commission <a href="https://www.engadget.com/eu-agreement-digital-services-act-172049636.html">announced</a> that it had reached an agreement in April to create new rules that would require platforms like Facebook to offer alternative systems &quot;not based on profiling&quot; as a key requirement.&nbsp;</p><p>Meta said it has mobilized over 1,000 people to &quot;develop solutions to the DSA's requirements.&quot; Some of the changes will increase transparency about how its systems work and provide users more options to tailor their experiences on Facebook and Instagram. At the same time, it's establishing an &quot;independent compliance function&quot; to ensure it meets ongoing regulatory obligations.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Starting later this month, Meta will offer Reels, Stories, Search and other parts of Facebook and Instagram that are unranked by Meta using its AI recommendation process. &quot;For example, on Facebook and Instagram, users will have the option to view Stories and Reels only from people they follow, ranked in chronological order, newest to oldest,&quot; wrote Meta President of Global Affairs Nick Clegg.&nbsp;</p><p>It's not clear how Meta will implement the change. The main Feed on Instagram already allows users to sort by Following instead of using the algorithm-based approach. However, the &quot;Following&quot; feature is effectively a secondary page on Instagram, and the app always defaults to the algorithmic &quot;For You&quot; option when first opened. Facebook is even more of a hassle, forcing you to select a menu, go into Feeds and tap &quot;Friends&quot;  rather than &quot;All.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Users will also be able to view Search results based only on the words they enter, rather than results personalized specifically to them based on their previous activity and personal interests. The company is also providing more information about how its AI systems rank content via 22 system cards for Facebook and Instagram, adding to its &quot;Why Am I Seeing This&quot; feature.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;These cards provide information about how our AI systems rank content for Feed, Reels, Stories, and other surfaces; some of the predictions each system makes to determine what content might be most relevant to people; and the options available to help customize an experience on Facebook and Instagram,&quot; Meta said.</p><p>Meta is also expanding its Ad library to display and archive all ads (for one year) that target EU users, including date run, parameters used for targeting (age, gender, location), who received the ad and more. It's also rolling out two new tools for researchers that include publicly available content from Pages, Posts, Groups and Events.&nbsp;</p><p>The company said that it &quot;welcomes the principles of transparency, accountability and user empowerment at the heart of the DSA,&quot; adding it has &quot;long advocated for a harmonized regulatory regime.&quot; However, Meta previously expressed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ios-14-privacy-changes-new-add-090000011.html">extreme displeasure</a> when Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/apple-ios-14-ad-tracking/">introduced changes</a> that allowed users to easily opt out of targeted advertising starting with iOS 14. To that end, observers will no doubt be keenly interested in how the changes are implemented and whether they follow the letter, if not the spirit, of the new law.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/facebook-and-instagram-will-offer-chronological-stories-and-reels-to-comply-with-eu-law-103612256.html?src=rss

## Microsoft will sell Activision Blizzard streaming rights to Ubisoft in attempt to win UK approval

<p>Microsoft is significantly restructuring its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-and-activision-extend-the-deadline-for-their-687-billion-merger-to-october-18th-132138900.html">Activision Blizzard merger</a> proposal by selling cloud gaming rights for Activision Blizzard games to rival Ubisoft, it wrote in a <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2Jsb2dzLm1pY3Jvc29mdC5jb20vb24tdGhlLWlzc3Vlcy8yMDIzLzA4LzIxL21pY3Jvc29mdC1hY3RpdmlzaW9uLXJlc3RydWN0dXJlLWFjcXVpc2l0aW9uLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZmFiMjJlMTQtZWM3Ny00ODIzLWJmZDctYzUwZDFjZmI1ZDczIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAYhlHhxORDBz5zWW3oozg4ZWPXdGUPeRYlEmJgJqCoKm&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fblogs.microsoft.com%2Fon-the-issues%2F2023%2F08%2F21%2Fmicrosoft-activision-restructure-acquisition%2F">blog post</a> late yesterday. That would address a key concern of UK regulators, which blocked the deal in part become of Microsoft's potential dominance in cloud gaming — but nothing is likely to be approved until October 18th.&nbsp;</p><p>"As a result of the agreement with Ubisoft, Microsoft believes its proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard presents a substantially different transaction under UK law than the transaction Microsoft submitted for the CMA’s consideration in 2022," Microsoft President Brad Smith wrote.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If the merger goes through, Microsoft would transfer "cloud streaming rights for all current and new Activision Blizzard PC and console games released over the next 15 years to Ubisoft Entertainment SA, a leading global game publisher.

## X plans to remove news headlines and text in shared articles

<p>Those who follow publications like <em>Engadget</em> on X, the social network formerly known as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/x-is-fixing-a-bug-that-wiped-out-twitter-images-from-before-2014-224746265.html">Twitter</a>, will know that the articles they share on the platform appear with a text snippet, an image and a sometimes-truncated version of their headline. That may not be the case in the near future. According to <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/08/21/elon-musk-plans-remove-headlines-news-articles-link-shared-on-x-twitter/"><em>Fortune</em></a>, the company is planning to implement major changes to the way shared articles appear on a tweet (or a post, as it's now called) by removing their text elements and leaving just their lead images with an overlay of the URL. In a post about the update, Elon Musk has confirmed that X is working on the new format and that the idea came from him directly.</p><div id="c67bbec418f74427b6fbeff768d32307"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">This is coming from me directly. Will greatly improve the esthetics.</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1693843680904216619?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 22, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>That corroborates <em>Fortune's</em> report, which says Musk is pushing for the new format. It also says that the change going to happen even though X ran it by advertisers who didn't like it. The company's main reason for removing the text in shared tweets is apparently to make posts look less compact and to fit more of them in the portion of the timeline that appears on screen. Musk also thinks it could help lessen instances of clickbait shared on the website. As the publication explains, X's current format typically cuts part of the headline in shared articles, which works to the advantage of websites that write clickbait headlines and posts.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It's also very much possible that X is implementing this change to encourage not just news publications, but also individuals, to write meatier posts on the website itself. After all, they will have to add context to the URL they share in order to get readers to click through the lead image. Musk has been encouraging users to post long-form pieces directly on the platform and allows Blue subscribers to write <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-is-working-on-new-publishing-tools-for-long-form-articles-185302573.html">as many as 25,000 characters</a> in a single post. More recently, Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1693756240260698550">tweeted</a> that journalists who want &quot;more freedom to write and a higher income&quot; should publish directly on X. As <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/08/21/twitter-to-hide-news-headlines/"><em>9to5Mac</em></a> notes, though, X recently had some <a href="https://twitter.com/Support/status/1687623817781501952">issues</a> paying creators part of its ad revenue-sharing program, because the number of interested users far exceeded its expectations.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/x-plans-to-remove-news-headlines-and-text-in-shared-articles-063101122.html?src=rss

## Rode's Wireless Pro mic kit lets you forget about 'clipped' audio

<p>It might not be an overstatement to say Rode's original Wireless GO microphone system changed how a lot of YouTubers work. It wasn't the first wireless mic system, not by a long long shot, but its focus on creators made it incredibly popular. That success would inspire a lot of competing products — <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dji-mic-clip-on-lapel-175000217.html">such as DJI's</a> — which have since won over fans in a category that Rode arguably defined. Today, Rode fights back with the Wireless Pro — its new flagship wireless microphone system for creators.</p><p>The headline feature is the inclusion of onboard 32-bit float recording which means you should no longer have to worry about setting mic gain levels (though it's probably best that you do). This feature means the onboard recording will be almost impossible to &quot;clip&quot; or distort through being too loud. Effectively you should always have a useable recording if things went a bit too loud on the audio in your camera, which will be a great anxiety reducer to anyone who's ever had a production ruined thanks to bad audio.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Wireless Pro could arguably help bring 32-bit float into the mainstream. There are specialist audio recorders out there that already offer this feature. And Rode already included it on its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rode-claims-its-new-podcast-friendly-nt1-offers-unclippable-audio-230009586.html">NT1 hybrid studio microphone</a>, but given that you can plug a lot of different microphones into the Wireless Pro transmitters, this opens the door for recording a wide variety of audio content in 32-bit float — as long as you can feed it into a 3.5mm jack.</p><p>In a further attempt at streamlining the creatory process, the Wireless Pro also has advanced timecode capability so you won't need an external device for this. Though you will need to set this up via Rode Central, the companion app for the mic (there's no option on-device for this setting).</p><figure><img alt="A press shot of the Wireless Pro vlog microphone kit." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/38b41910-4037-11ee-a9fb-2a2938fac69d" style="height: 1170px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>The Wireless Pro borrows a few features from alternatives or aftermarket accessories by including a charging case as standard (Rode currently offers one as a standalone purchase). That case is good for two total charges of the entire system according to the company and comes as standard with the new model. The stated battery life for the transmitters and receiver is around severn hours, meaning the Wireless Pro should be good for at least 20 hours total recording onto the 32gb storage (good for 40 hours of material apparently).</p><p>Another key upgrade is the improved range. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rodes-wireless-go-ii-unveiled-150043322.html">Wireless GO II</a>, for example, has an approximate range of 656 feet (200 meters). The new Pro models expands that to 850 feet (260 meters) which is, coincidentally, a shade more than DJI's stated 820 feet (250 meters).</p><p>When Rode unveiled its more affordale Wireless ME kit, it introduced the idea of the receiver doubling as a &quot;narrator&quot; mic via a TRRS headset in the headphones/monitoring port. That's a feature that carries over to the Pro meaning you can record up to three different speakers albeit one of them will be wired, rather than cable free.</p><p>There are a couple of minor, but welcome quality of life updates, too, such as locking 3.5mm jacks so you won't rip your lav mic out and plugin power detection so the system can detect when the camera its plugged into is active, using that info to optimize power usage.</p><p>At time of publication, DJI's dual-mic product retails for $330. The Rode Wireless Pro will cost $399. That's obviously a slice more, but the company decided to include two Lavalier II mics as part of the bundle. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-mobile-microphones-for-recording-with-a-phone-154536629.html">Lavalier II</a> costs $99 on its own, so from that perspective the entire bundle represents a decent value if you're looking for complete solution.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/rodes-wireless-pro-mic-kit-lets-you-forget-about-clipped-audio-000028417.html?src=rss
