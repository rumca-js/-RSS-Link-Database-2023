		Following in a path trod two decades ago by local-area network service firms, a managed ID services firm is marketing a security backstop.

<a href="https://beyondid.com/">BeyondID</a> has introduced its security operations center (SOC), which continuously monitors a customer's security standing and detects threats, in partnership with compliance automation firm Drata. The company, which did not reveal the service's cost, claims real-time watchfulness.

"The volume of security threats and breaches has reached a level that is nearly impossible for even the most competent IT teams to manage around the clock," says BeyondID CEO Arun Shrestha in a statement.

The security operations center secures ID and user-driven endpoints, user apps and unnamed legacy ID products, and is staffed by “certified identity professionals,” according to the company’s <a href="https://beyondid.com/services/security-operations-center/">website</a>.

The security operations center has a logging agent that is designed to pass along live data for collection, threat detection, triage, investigation and response, if any.

		<em>By Dan Yerushalmi, CEO, <a href="https://www.au10tix.com/">AU10TIX</a></em>

In a world where technology's rapid evolution shapes our daily lives, the concept of personal identification is undergoing a remarkable transformation. The traditional reliance on paper-based credentials is now giving way to vast and dynamic digital identities, instigating a sweeping reinterpretation of how authenticity and verification procedures are approached. This seismic shift is opening doors to both new possibilities and challenges, ushering in an era when the essence of who we are and how we prove it takes on an entirely new dimension.
<h2>Benefits and current usage of digital IDs</h2>
Real-world implementations vividly exemplify the transformative potential of digital identities. For example, Australia's <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/mygovid">myGovID</a> has seamlessly revolutionized how citizens engage with government services, offering secure and convenient online access that eliminates the cumbersome need for physical visits or document handling. Similarly, India's <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/aadhaar">Aadhaar</a> assigns a distinctive 12-digit identity number to each individual, simplifying access to government services and essential welfare programs. This innovative system not only streamlines identification but also bridges societal gaps, ensuring equitable service delivery.

On a broader scale, Estonia's visionary <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202205/estonia-signs-sk-id-as-mobile-digital-id-provider-after-search-for-alternatives">e-Residency</a> program introduces a glimpse of governance's future. This initiative extends digital citizenship to non-residents, providing them access to Estonia's digital services and business ecosystem. By leveraging a secure digital identity, e-residents can seamlessly establish and manage businesses, sign documents, and tap into government services from a distance. This progressive approach fosters economic growth and also illustrates how digital identities can transcend geographical borders, fostering unparalleled possibilities for global collaboration and entrepreneurial endeavors.

In the United States, a transition is underway with the adoption of digital IDs. Several states are progressively implementing <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/california-has-a-shiny-new-app-for-its-mdl">digital driver's licenses</a> and identification cards, signaling a shift towards enhanced convenience and security. Digital IDs empower individuals to securely carry their identification in a readily accessible digital format on their smartphones. This not only reduces reliance on physical cards but also reinforces security through features such as biometric authentication.

Collectively, these global examples underscore the substantial impact of digital identities. From Estonia's boundary-pushing cross-border initiative to the U.S.'s drive for heightened security and convenience, digital identities are fundamentally reshaping how governments and citizens interact, conduct business, and navigate an interconnected world.
<h2>Challenges and adoption barriers</h2>
However, amidst the boundless promises ushered in by this digital revolution, we find ourselves faced with a set of formidable challenges that demand our attention. Among these obstacles, privacy concerns loom large, as individuals understandably seek reassurance that their sensitive information will be safeguarded in this interconnected landscape.

One such challenge that merits attention is the need for technological interoperability between different digital identity types. Ensuring that diverse digital identity systems can seamlessly work together is crucial in breaking down barriers and simplifying interactions.

The paramount importance of data security also cannot be overstated, with the ever present threat of cyberattacks reminding us of the critical need for fortified defenses. Moreover, the stark reality of technological inequalities accentuates the immediate need for comprehensive solutions – ensuring that digital identity systems are accessible to all, bridging the digital divide and promoting inclusivity.

By acknowledging and tackling these multifaceted challenges head-on, we set the stage for a more inclusive and secure adoption of digital identities. Moving forward, successful progress requires close collaboration and innovative problem-solving, tailoring solutions to address the unique aspects of each challenge.

Crucially, the establishment of standardized practices and robust regulatory frameworks will underpin this journey, guiding the integration of digital identities into our lives. These frameworks will not only ensure a secure foundation but also foster interoperability across systems, effectively dismantling barriers and streamlining the assimilation process.

		A quartet of announcements reveal a new software package from Axiad and a distribution deal for Journey which implement biometrics to enhance the security of digital identity management systems and make passwordless authentication more widespread. Secret Double Octopus is expanding a strategic partnership, while an SME-tailored service from Oliu uses a decentralized approach without biometrics to achieve the same end.

Passwordless authentication orchestration software provider <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/axiad">Axiad</a> has launched its new Unified Credential Management System (UCMS) package, called Passwordless for Air Gapped and Critical Environments. The bundle is intended to meet the phishing-resistant requirements of the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202105/biden-goes-broad-and-deep-with-order-requiring-mfa-zero-trust-architecture">U.S. executive order</a> to improve on the nation's cybersecurity with multi-factor authentication (MFA) and zero trust architecture. Axiad supports Windows Hello, FIDO, mobile MFA, YubiKeys, and other biometric authentication options.

Cyber attacks targeting critical infrastructure made up <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/11/04/microsoft-digital-defense-report-2022-ukraine/">40 percent of all nation state</a> attacks detected by Microsoft, double the percentage compared to the year prior. The U.S. government responded by mandating passwordless MFA for government agencies, among other requirements. The package is fully interoperable with a wide range of Microsoft products.

Biometric cybersecurity developer <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/journey">Journey</a> announced it is partnering with contact center software provider <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/avaya">Avaya</a>. Journey's biometric authentication is now available on the Avaya Hybrid Cloud Services (HCS) platform. It enables agents to use a facial photo to authenticate into their agent desktop apps without a password. This can eliminate password resets, which cost roughly $70-$80 each, the announcement states.

An optional feature is Continuous Biometric Authentication, which periodically performs face scans throughout the day and enables the detection of multiple faces looking at the desktop. Supervisors will have access to a dashboard with authentication event information, ensuring only the right people can access corporate assets.

Customer authentication will be added to HCS in the coming months, granting Avaya customers smart device capabilities like face biometrics and document scanning.

"Enabling biometric authentication in HCS is a game changer for contact centers that want to operate more securely and efficiently," says co-founder and CEO of Journey, Brett Shockley.

<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/secret-double-octopus">Secret Double Octopus</a> and Japanese managed enterprise security provider KDDI Digital Security have expanded a strategic partnership to add FIDO2-compliant passwordless authentication from SDO to KDDI’s platform.

The partnership began in February of this year with KDDI offering SDO’s traditional MFA to VPN managed service customers.

<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/atb-ventures">ATB Ventures</a>, the product development arm of ATB Financial, announced the release of a new service for its digital identity management platform, <a href="https://canada.oliu.id/">Oliu</a>, designed to support small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Canada.

The pay-as-you-go, cloud-based API subscription service helps SMEs with affordable KYC compliance while decreasing authentication risks, according to the announcement.

## Another try at biometric gun control forms in California

		A California initiative would set new standards for gun safety in the state. The Gun Violence Prevention Act has been proposed for inclusion on the November 2024 general election ballot by Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen.

<a href="https://www.gvpanow.org/">The law</a> would dictate that, starting a year after passage, all new firearms sold in California would include an integrated trigger lock and storage system. The lock could be biometric, according to the proposal. By five years later, all firearms would be required to have biometric locks.

The plan is to ensure that only the licensed owner or other approved users can access and use the firearm. According to Rosen, an inoperable firearm due to biometric trigger locks could reduce accidental shootings, especially by children, and curtail the violence stemming from firearm thefts.

Biometric firearm companies are marketing guns with removable biometric trigger locks. <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/biofire-technologies">Biofire</a> is spearheading so-called <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/smart-gun">smart gun</a> technology, while <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/identilock">Identilock</a> and <a href="https://bisongunlock.com/">Bison</a> are working on biometric trigger locks.

The debate over digitally locked guns continues. An election win in California would be the highest-profile advancement for the technology in the United States.

The state house is controlled by Democrats, a party that generally favor heavier regulations on personal weapons, but any gun issue on a ballot tends to pull opposition Republicans to the polls.

The state of New Jersey, on the opposite U.S. coast, <a href="https://www.thetrace.org/2023/05/new-jersey-childproof-smart-handgun-law/">has tried</a> for many years to impose biometric and other locks on personal weapons , but the efforts have been thwarted by opponents of gun regulations.

## Ghana, Zambia plan biometric voter registration drives for September

		Ghana’s Electoral Commission (EC) has announced a three-week nationwide biometric voter registration activity beginning next month in preparation for District Assembly elections later this year, as well as for general elections in 2024. The accouchement comes as the Electoral Commission of Zambia (ECZ) also said it will resume a continuous voter registration exercise in 10 more districts of the country on September 5.
<h2>Ghana voter registration will be nationwide</h2>
In a recent press conference introduced under the name, “Let the citizen know,” the EC chairperson, Jean Mensa, explained that the voter registration drive will begin on September 12 and end on October 2 in all the 268 districts of the country, Modern Ghana <a href="https://www.modernghana.com/news/1252465/ec-to-embark-on-registration-exercise-from-septemb.html">reports</a>.

According to Mensa, the enrollment targets those who have attained the age of 18 since the last voter registration cycle in 2020, as well as citizens who had registered in the past but lost their voter’s cards. A fee of 10 Ghana Cedis (US$0.80) will be charged for card replacement, she told Ghanaians.

Mensa also announced that District Level Assembly elections will take place on December 19 in all but two districts.

It is not fully clear if the Ghana Card will be the sole ID document for voter registration as the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202304/ec-presses-on-with-plan-to-make-ghana-card-lone-id-for-voter-registration">EC is trying to push</a> through a Constitutional Instrument (CI) which is currently in Parliament.

However, Mensa has said that they are not turning back on their plan of doing away with the guarantor voter registration system. She said the Ghana Card is the best way the EC will ensure transparency and credibility in the voter registration process, Modern Ghana writes in another <a href="https://www.modernghana.com/news/1252555/ghana-card-surest-way-to-ensure-voter-roll-integr.html">report</a>.

She stated that the old system remained in place for 30 years because there was no Ghana Card. “We now have the Ghana Card and we must rely on it. It is the surest way to ensure the integrity of our register,” she said.

In the meantime, some political parties are already criticizing the EC for limiting the biometric voter registration to district offices, saying it will disenfranchise many Ghanaians. They want the exercise to be taken right down to electoral areas.
<h2>Zambia’s continuous voter registration begins Sept. 5</h2>
Senior corporate affairs officer at the ECZ, Sylvia Bwalya, recently told <a href="https://www.lusakatimes.com/2023/08/17/ecz-to-resumes-continuous-voter-registration-exercise/">Lusaka Times</a> that the voter registration exercise will bring the number of districts covered by the exercise to 20.

Ten other districts had started the registration in June last year, with authorities saying it will be progressively extended throughout the country.

Bwalya said district registration offices will be open every weekday from 08:00-17:00 local time. The exercise involves citizens who are 18 years and above, and those who possess a green national registration card.

Services to be offered include transfer of polling stations, replacement of lost or damaged voter’s cards, and change of biographical information. The date when the registration will end is not mentioned.

Updates on an <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202203/biometrics-registration-for-zambias-new-national-id-system-underway">enrollment process for new national ID cards</a> in Zambia were given to the country’s Parliament early last year.
<h2>Court rules no access to voter’s register in Zimbabwe</h2>
In neighbouring Zimbabwe, meanwhile, a court recently ruled that the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) is not obliged to allow some parties access to the updated biometric voter’s register.

The political parties had raised concerns over irregularities with the voter’s registry, but ZEC argued that the claims were unfounded and were a machination to discredit its work, per a <a href="https://www.news24.com/news24/africa/news/zimbabwe-polls-to-go-ahead-without-provision-of-updated-voters-roll-by-electoral-commission-20230815">report</a> by News 24.

Zimbabweans go to the polls tomorrow August 23 to elect a new President and Members of Parliament.

		A number of decentralized finance (DeFi) companies are partnering with ID verification software firms to give customers security while preserving their privacy.

Permissionless identity verification firm <a href="https://0xkyc.id/">0xKYC</a> and DeFi platform <a href="https://hinkal.pro/">Hinkal Protocol</a> announced a new partnership that will bring soulbound tokens – non-transferrable NFTs that can represent a person's identity – to Hinkal Protocol's operations.

The tokens use permissionless zero-knowledge proofs, which allows for the verification of a wallet without needing explicit consent from the owner or the need to share data with third parties. This can increase trustworthiness within Web3 and create a new model for privacy-compliant crypto trading, the announcement states.

Global RegTech startup and IDV and fraud prevention company <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/idenfy">iDenfy</a> announced it is partnering with Web3 network software and real-time blockchain data company <a href="https://www.syntropynet.com/">Syntropy</a>. iDenfy will now be responsible for KYC and AML compliance through ID verification checks from Syntropy's clients and partners.

The company uses blockchain to tokenize unused bandwidth which can become a resource that can be traded in real-time. The transactions will use Syntropy’s native ERC-20 token, $NOIA. Anyone has the ability to link their device to the mesh network and function as a relay point to transmit data, which allows for the construction of interconnected networks rather than a single private network.

iDenfy will automate KYC/AML compliance to improve speed and security. It uses face biometrics and liveness detection to verify identities. Its <a href="https://www.idenfy.com/aml-screening/">AML compliance</a> checks can compare individual identities to watchlists and find negative news articles through internet crawling. Blockchain companies can develop risk profiles and link that data to a specific digital wallet address. It can also require reauthentication for high-risk transactions.

Centralized DeFi service provider, <a href="https://www.penning.dk">Penning</a>, announced it is partnering with ID verification provider <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/shufti-pro">Shufti Pro</a> to improve security for Penning Pay, a cross-border payment platform.

## Titans of content write ‘I love mom’ report about age verification challenges

		A little-known group of very big names in online content has some thoughts about <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/age-verification">age verification</a>, biometrics-based and otherwise. But its membership rolls casts doubt on how far the group will go to segregate online life, children from adults.

The 16-year-old Family Online Safety Institute, whose members are global, but most from the United States, published a policy paper last month that is as bland as the institute's name. Its goal is help society in "<a href="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f4dd3623430990e705ccbba/64b0011a158eea37fb7796c4_FOSI%20White%20Paper%20Coming%20to%20Terms%20with%20Age%20Assurance%20FOR%20WEBSITE.pdf">Coming to Terms with Age Assurance</a>."

Few if any suggestions are made in the document. It's all about discussing challenges and opportunities that are well-known in the industry and among regulators. There is a loop: transparency, children, privacy, safety, family, children….

Essentially, anything that anyone does to age-gate the internet will cost money that content makers do not want to spend, add friction to the lives of their customers, and according to some <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/battle-over-age-verification-heats-up-in-increasingly-censorious-us">unprofitably</a> <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/mixed-start-for-privacy-advocates-fighting-us-age-verification-rules-for-adult-content">compromise privacy</a> while increasing liability.

So, institute members are focusing on the minimum effort that everyone is simultaneously required to make. Biometrics comes up once, with the observation that age verification must be distinguished from identification. Two sections are telling.

One two-page segment is titled, "What policymakers can do" and the next, half-page chapter is "considerations" for industry.

In fact, policymakers in developed economies are already moving, unevenly, on the issue.

<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/anti-porn-age-verification-for-minors-in-uk-and-us-attracts-data-protection-criticism"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requiring age assurance to see adult content is embedded in the United Kingdom's Online Safety Bill and efforts in various U.S. states</span>. And opponents say they are willing to compromise consumers' privacy to make it work, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-66065600">according to</a> reporting by the BBC.

They either are demonstrating uncommon fortitude, or they feel their electorates mostly feel the same urgency to segregate content.

All the while, digital ID software makers are <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/uk-world-news/ten-lethal-items-children-young-8691272">feeding news cycles</a> with research favorable to their revenue goals about how easy it is for a child to buy access to dangerous materials like weapons and, improbably, tanning beds.

That message is more likely to find an audience among some politicians than among titans of content.

Members of the institute include Amazon, TikTok, Mattel, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>, Google, Epic Games and Comcast.

<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/amazon">Amazon'</a>s name stands out not least for its CEO's stance on corporate passivity in the face of potential complaints from consumers on a related topic, privacy.

Two years ago, Andy Jassy, who was still awaiting his anointing at the time, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202102/short-amazons-facial-recognition-ban-go-long-on-selling-rekognition-to-cops-again">said</a> if people feel wronged by what Amazon does with their biometric data, they can file a complaint online like everyone else. The company would weigh each note and act as it sees fit.

All of which is to say that anyone wanting actionable ideas on how best to protect children's minds while greasing the skids for adults online will have to wait for another institute note.

## Influential face biometrics group FISWG seeks feedback on 5 papers

		The Facial Identification Scientific Working Group (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/facial-identification-scientific-working-group-fiswg/">FISWG</a>) has published an ethics code for facial recognition users and a guide to face biometrics to generate investigative leads, among five documents released for public comment.

FISWG is a group made up of more than 50 law enforcement and intelligence organizations and businesses, including biometrics developers <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/aware-inc">Aware</a>, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/ideal-innovations-inc">Ideal Innovations</a>, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/idemia-identity-security-north-america">Idemia NA</a> and <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/rank-one-computing-corporation">Rank One Computing</a>. Most of the organizations are based in the states, but there are also organizations from Canada, England, Jamaica, Brazil, Australia and several European countries, as well as Europol.

The group is seeking comments on its “Facial Identification Practitioner Code of Ethics v3.0,” “Facial Recognition Systems Operation Assurance: Lessons Learned in Investigative Searches v1.0,” “Facial Recognition Systems Operation Assurance: Preserving Image Quality in Desktop Documents v1.1,” “Guide for the Use of Facial Comparison Investigative Leads v1.0” and “Guideline for ACE-V Methodology in One-to-One Comparisons v1.0” by October 14, 2023.

The code of ethics consists of nine stipulations for face biometrics practitioners, and is meant to compliment rather than replace other codes. Version 2.0 was published in 2018.

FISWG guidelines are used to guide investigative processes in the field, such as for <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202212/danish-forensic-procedure-addresses-subjectivity-in-face-biometrics-investigations">facial feature analysis</a> by the Danish National ID Centre.

		<a href="https://dock.tech/en/">Dock</a>, a Brazilian payments and digital banking provider serving the Latin American market, announced that it is partnering with AML and fraud prevention provider <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/feedzai">Feedzai</a>. Dock customers will now be able to access the RiskOps platform which includes a native behavioral biometrics module that will provide companies of all sizes with digital footprints of consumers conducting transactions.

Feedzai uses machine learning to increase threat detection accuracy and improve security. By comparing an individual customer's current and previous behavior, the platform can identify activity that falls out of the user's unique patterns. The company added behavioral biometrics to its portfolio when it <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202108/feedzai-adds-behavioral-biometrics-to-fraud-prevention-platform-with-revelock-acquisition">acquired Revelock</a> in 2021.

"We are providing our customers with another cloud-first technology solution that delivers a personalized approach to cyber threat detection and assessment, based on machine learning models and supported by Dock's expertise," says Armando Junior, risk director at Dock. "This partnership is aligned with our Latin American expansion strategy. The new feature makes it possible for us to understand even better the needs of our customers throughout the region."

Dock has prioritized financial inclusion of the unbanked and underbanked during its 20+ years of operations. It currently manages over 70 million accounts and oversees over $240 billion in transactions each year. Last year, Dock saw its market value reach $1.5 billion after acquiring almost $134 million in its latest round of funding.

Dock is also collaborating with <a href="https://tenpo.cl/">Tenpo</a>, the top digital bank in Chile, with over 2.2 million clients, according to another announcement demonstrating its expansion in the region.
