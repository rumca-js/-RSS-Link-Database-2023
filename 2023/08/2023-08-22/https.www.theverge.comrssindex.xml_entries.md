Later this fall, the company says it will open up the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/21/23803129/openai-updates-its-api">arguably more advanced</a> GPT-4 for the same purpose this fall.</p>
<p id="Mcl70W">Fine-tuning lets businesses essentially hone ChatGPT to a more focused model that’s especially efficient for certain tasks. The supervised training would make a bot that’s unique to the client company so that it offers, say, reliable responses in a specific language or with more concise wording. Until now, business customers were <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/legacy-fine-tuning">limited to GPT-3 variants</a> for this, like davinci-002 or babbage-002.</p>

  <p id="dREWV7">Twitch is the latest tech company to try a TikTok-like way to browse content. The company is experimenting with a feature that surfaces clips in a new vertically-scrolling feed that it calls the “discovery feed,” and the feed is starting to roll out to “select users” on Tuesday, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitchSupport/status/1694026169971314959">a post from Twitch on X</a>.</p>
<p id="jAiQue">The feed will show you clips from Twitch creators, though to start, the clips will only be horizontal clips; Twitch says users will see vertical clips “<a href="https://twitter.com/TwitchSupport/status/1694027128151663062">as the feed evolves</a>.” The discovery feed currently includes “featured” clips (creators can mark which of their clips <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1686423052148744192">they want to be added to the “featured” pool</a>) as well as popular clips.</p>

<p id="smK1nW"><em>Rebel Moon</em> appears to be Synder’s attempt at creating his own sci-fi epic. Here’s the basic premise:</p>

  <p id="FwaO20">Disasters have no borders, and a summer of unexpected catastrophe across the US shows it. California is notorious for drought and fire, not tropical storms like Hilary that barreled over Los Angeles this week. The East Coast expects hurricanes, not the pollution nightmare triggered by smoke that drifted in from blazes hundreds of miles away. Hawaii’s native greenery isn’t supposed to burn, and yet fires engulfed Maui.</p>
<p id="wNrtsu">Climate change is sending new calamities to new places — a phenomenon that can be observed not just in the US but all over the world. It’s piling disaster upon disaster on communities figuring out how to adapt to these new realities. Often, they’re faced with some new crisis while still recovering from a previous one. </p>

  <p id="Aixi2G">The first saga in <em>Destiny</em>’s universe is coming to an end with an epic battle between light and darkness. <em>Destiny</em>’s light and darkness saga has always been about The Traveler, a mysterious entity in the universe of <em>Destiny </em>that hangs motionless in the sky as a source of light for <em>Destiny </em>players. Now, The Traveler is asking <em>Destiny 2 </em>players for help, and it’s time to answer that call on February 27th.</p>
<p id="HphwSW">A mysterious enemy, The Witness, has already entered The Traveler, and now, <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> players will have to venture inside to help defeat The Witness. What awaits inside is the Pale Heart, a first linear destination that’s unlike anything we’ve seen in <em>Destiny</em> during its nearly 10-year history.</p>

  <p id="XmydmY">At this point, live-action <em>Star Wars</em> shows are no longer novel. In fact, it’s getting pretty crowded out there, with everything from the ongoing adventures of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23691602/the-mandalorian-season-3-finale-disney-plus"><em>The Mandalorian</em></a> to series like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23475256/andor-season-one-finale-review-star-wars-disney-plus"><em>Andor</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23178299/obi-wan-kenobi-season-1-review-disney-plus"><em>Obi-Wan</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22925214/the-book-of-boba-fett-season-finale-review-star-wars-disney-plus"><em>The Book of Boba Fett</em></a>. So, a new story like <em>Ahsoka</em> needs to do something a little different to stand out from the ever-growing pack. And in its first two episodes, the series manages to do just that by focusing on a very specific and important part of the <em>Star Wars</em> mythos: mystery.</p>
<p id="GVH6jZ">The show starts out like classic <em>Star Wars</em>, complete with a title crawl (this time in red text) followed by a massive spaceship slowly making its way through the inky expanse of space. The story — which takes place roughly during the same period as <em>The...</em></p>

  <p id="ZQVQjk">The fall semester is officially kicking off in much of the country, so if you haven’t started preparing for the year ahead, it’s wise to start now. Thankfully, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23464331/amazfit-gtr-4-review-budget-wearable-smartwatch"><strong>Amazfit GTR 4</strong></a> — which is one of our top <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23800225/back-to-school-student-gifts-college-high-school-dorm-ideas-2023">back-to-school guide picks</a> — has returned to its 2023 all-time low price of $169.99 ($30 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Android-Dual-Band-Bluetooth-Battery/dp/B0B8YR3KZS/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/ckqvGMA73cI">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazfit-gtr-4-superspeed-black%2F-%2FA-87876021&amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Target</a>.</p>

  <p id="79eUlG">Microsoft is bringing popular programming language Python to Excel. A public preview of the feature is available today, allowing Excel users to manipulate and analyze data from Python.</p>
<p id="tLIDZA">“You can manipulate and explore data in Excel using Python plots and libraries, and then use Excel’s formulas, charts and PivotTables to further refine your insights,” <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/introducing-python-in-excel-the-best-of-both-worlds-for-data/ba-p/3905482">explains Stefan Kinnestrand</a>, general manager of modern work at Microsoft. “Now you can do advanced data analysis in the familiar Excel environment by accessing Python directly from the Excel ribbon.”</p>
<p id="rvEUtq">You won’t need to install any additional software or set up an add-on to access the functionality, as Python integration in Excel will be part of Excel’s built-in connectors and Power Query....</p>

  <p id="TwGK5k">Nvidia is starting to roll out access to PC Game Pass and Microsoft Store titles on its GeForce Now streaming service this week. PC Game Pass subscribers will be able to start streaming titles through GeForce Now on August 24th, including first-party Microsoft games like <em>Deathloop </em>and <em>Grounded </em>as well as<em> </em>third-party titles like <em>No Man’s Sky </em>and <em>Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord.</em></p>
<p id="CyrB4v">While PC Game Pass and Microsoft Store games will be available on GeForce Now, not all of them will be available to stream immediately on Nvidia’s service. Nvidia has done the work to integrate the Microsoft Store into GeForce Now, but it still needs to onboard all the games that are available on a PC Game Pass subscription.</p>

  <p id="sxSt7o">Nvidia is introducing DLSS 3.5 this fall with a new AI-powered Ray Reconstruction technique that’s designed to improve the quality of ray tracing. Unlike <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/20/23362990/nvidia-dlss-3-0-demonstration-ada-lovelace-graphics-cards-upscaling-technology">DLSS 3’s Frame Generation</a>, which was limited to just RTX 40-series GPUs, DLSS 3.5 will boost ray tracing across all RTX-series GPUs going back to the RTX 20 series. </p>
<p id="82WSpr">Nvidia is primarily targeting DLSS 3.5 at games that offer path tracing, often known as full ray tracing, as opposed to titles that use ray tracing just for select elements like shadows or reflections. <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>will get support for DLSS 3.5 with its <em>Phantom Liberty</em> DLC releasing on September 26th, which also adds the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/23/23653237/cyberpunk-2077-overdrive-mode-full-ray-tracing-path-tracing">path tracing previewed earlier this year</a>. <em>Alan Wake 2</em> will also launch on October 27th with DLSS 3.5...</p>

  <p id="ECWtRI">Meta is finally launching a much more capable web app for Threads, the company announced on Tuesday. You’ll be able to post, interact with other posts, and look at your feed, spokesperson Christine Pai tells <em>The Verge</em>. It’s set to roll out over the next few days, <a href="https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/CwP2yyiL15R">Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg says</a>.</p>
<p id="tucPim">So far, Threads on the web has essentially been a glorified way to look at somebody’s profile — you couldn’t even like or reshare a post even though the web app included the buttons to do so. (If you clicked them, Threads would show you a QR code to download the mobile app.) The new desktop web interface looks a lot like the one in the mobile app, though with some small differences; the navigation icons are on the top of the page, and to switch...</p>

  <p id="ocemHg">Microsoft is restructuring its proposed Activision Blizzard deal to transfer cloud gaming rights for current and new Activision Blizzard games to Ubisoft. The transfer of rights is designed to appease regulators in the UK that are concerned about the impact Microsoft’s proposed $68.7 billion deal will have on cloud gaming competition. The restructured deal has triggered a new regulatory investigation in the UK that could last until October 18th.</p>
<p id="0FFbdR">“To address the concerns about the impact of the proposed acquisition on cloud game streaming raised by the UK Competition and Markets Authority, we are restructuring the transaction to acquire a narrower set of rights,” <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/08/21/microsoft-activision-restructure-acquisition/">says Microsoft president Brad Smith</a>. “This includes executing an...</p>
