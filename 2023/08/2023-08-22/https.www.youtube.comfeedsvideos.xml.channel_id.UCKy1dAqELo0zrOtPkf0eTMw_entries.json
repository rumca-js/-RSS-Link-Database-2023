Also available on PlayStation 5 and PC.\n\n\"Immortals of Aveum is an impressively confident first-person shooter that successfully trades muzzles and magazines for mages and magic. Its fast-paced, spellcasting combat is both satisfying to master and spectacular to look at, and it features a lengthy and hearty campaign packed with secrets to keep us going well after the story has wrapped. As someone who desperately hopes that unapologetically single-player shooters will live forever, these Immortals have done a great job of making sure they\u2019re definitely not dead yet.\"", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1z_XIgqEfc", "date_published": "2023-08-22T04:00:23+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/Y1z_XIgqEfc/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Thank you for everything, Charles Martinet! #voiceover  #mario #nintendo #gaming #charlesmartinet", "description": "", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMOK2VvM38I", "date_published": "2023-08-22T01:56:46+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/HMOK2VvM38I/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Nintendo Confirms Charles Martinet Will Let-A-Go of Voicing Mario - IGN Daily Fix", "description": "On today's Daily Fix:\nNintendo has confirmed that Charles Martinet, the original voice actor of Mario who has played the character since 1991, will be \"stepping back from recording character voices for our games\" and will now serve as a \"Mario Ambassador.\" Bethesda head of publishing Pete Hines has spoken out in response to remarks made by ex-Blizzard developer Mark Kern, who had previously leaked an image of\u00a0Starfield\u2019s\u00a0start screen and criticized its design as \"hasty\" or the work of a team \"that didn't care\".
