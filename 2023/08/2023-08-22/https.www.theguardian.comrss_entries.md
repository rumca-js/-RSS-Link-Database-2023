<p>Coming-out tales, ventriloquism, a musical set in a public loo and glamorous late-night cabaret are among the festival’s uplifting LGBTQ+ shows</p><p>No one ever pays attention when you’re handed a flyer at the fringe. It’s only when I take a proper look that I realise I haven’t been handed a promotion but a protest. Offered with a smile, the leaflet is designed to look like medical information but warns, avidly, against the dangers of drag, LGBTQ+ sex education and “what they’re teaching our children”. Too flustered to be angry, I give it back, politely (too politely) tell the gathered group I disagree with them, and run to the show I’m late for.</p><p>At this year’s Edinburgh fringe, LGBTQ+ artists have made the majority of the joyful, audacious, uplifting work I’ve been lucky enough to see. In fact, this is such an overtly queer-positive festival that while the blatant anti-LGBTQ+ misinformation is at first deflating, it then feels almost ridiculous. Good luck being heard above all this gloriously gay noise.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/23/joyously-queer-shows-at-edinburgh-festival">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Kano, Skepta, Dizzee Rascal, and co narrate the early days of UK grime in this glorious documentary. The power of early footage of their performances is absolutely breathtaking</p><p>You really have to admire the brazenness of the UK’s grime artists in their prime, as captured in this expansive new documentary film, shown as part of the BBC’s Storyville strand. We’re shown a letter Lethal Bizzle wrote <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/jun/08/davidcameronisadonut">for this newspaper</a> headlined “David Cameron is a donut”. We’re shown a pirate radio station based directly above Tottenham police’s CID office, run by a man who is captioned as being “Not a drug dealer”. We’re shown Ofcom mercilessly shutting down similar stations playing grime, and yet – within 20 years – BBC Four is broadcasting <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001pvjf">this tale of the against-all-odds success story of the genre</a>: the faster, harder, sparser form of rap music that emerged from east London in the late 90s.</p><p>This 90-minute unnarrated documentary features most (but not all) of the pioneers of the scene, including Kano, Dizzee Rascal, D Double E, Jammer and Skepta. It is directed by the photographer and film-maker Ewen Spencer, who documented music scenes for the Face and Sleazenation in the early 00s. It’s a visual feast and a glorious flick book of British street style and flair dating back to 1990 – the year this story starts. As we’re initially guided through the eras of jungle and garage, the sonic precursors to grime, we’re simultaneously exposed to what ravers <em>really</em> looked like back then. People genuinely used to go to jungle raves in a wacky shirt and tie – and here’s the footage to prove it.</p><p>8 Bar: The Evolution of Grime aired on BBC Four and is available on <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001pvjf">iPlayer</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/aug/22/8-bar-the-evolution-of-grime-review-theres-more-energy-in-10-seconds-than-in-five-days-of-glastonbury">Continue reading...</a>

His new album, World Music Radio, came out earlier today and here in Williamsburg it’s part-show, part-celebration. Naturally, Batiste is in characteristically high spirits.</p><p>Batiste is playing the album’s Stevie Wonder-influenced Calling Your Name, a two-minute song that he stretches into a roughly 15 minute freestyle during which he jumps into the audience and parades around before plucking four members from the crowd, ushering them on stage and having them take turns singing and dancing. It’s a unique spectacle composed of equal parts pop anthem and jazz freestyle, all delivered with a distinct flavor of his native New Orleans (his family is a fixture in the town’s music scene and as a result Batiste has a penchant for leading theater crowds out into the street). It also demonstrates an artist at the intersection of a lifetime of performances on a litany of stages with a mainstream perch he’s continually finding the apex of.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/22/jon-batiste-interview-new-album-world-music-radio">Continue reading...</a>

His exit was “mutually agreed”, according to statements released by the striker and United, with the club concluding he did not commit the offences he was charged with. However, serious questions remain over United’s handling of the situation, and whether football clubs can ever be trusted to act as judge and jury over serious allegations involving their talent.</p><p>Greenwood was suspended by United in January 2022 after allegations made against him online, which led to him being arrested and later charged for attempted rape, controlling and coercive behaviour and assault. The CPS dropped the charges in February of this year, citing “a combination of the withdrawal of key witnesses and new material that came to light”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/22/it-was-right-for-mason-greenwood-to-go-but-football-clubs-shouldnt-be-making-such-decisions-alone">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Bloomsbury Group weren’t just artistic and sexual pioneers. They also sparked a sartorial revolution. We meet the author of Bring No Clothes, a revealing book about fashion’s queer trailblazers</p><p>It was recently called the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/aug/12/charleston-house-how-fashion-world-fell-for-bloomsbury-set-country-home">most fashionable house in England</a>, but on Tuesdays Charleston is closed to visitors and so blissfully empty. In a garden at the peak of its bloom this hot August morning, bees investigate the flowers and apple trees, while ducks cool their feathers in the lake. The Bloomsbury Group used this farmhouse in East Sussex as its countryside HQ for about 60 years, and since the members believed art and life should be thoroughly integrated, their idiosyncratic touches are everywhere. There is a picture on an easel of a naked man with a six-pack painted by Duncan Grant; yellow circles on a wardrobe decorated by Vanessa Bell; a walled garden designed by their fellow artist Roger Fry. Meanwhile, in the kitchen, eccentric pottery shades cover the lights; upstairs in the attic, there is a door frame covered in patterns painted by Bell; and beyond, windows that offer majestic views of the South Downs.</p><p>The fashion journalist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/may/16/the-art-of-getting-dressed-charlie-porter">Charlie Porter</a> has spent much of the past two years here, researching an exhibition and a book. Both are called Bring No Clothes, after Virginia Woolf’s instruction to visitors to leave their starched crinolines, whalebone corsets and medals at home, since the rejection of formal attire was part of Bloomsbury’s revolutionary lifestyle. “I’ve always wanted to look at what happened at the moment clothing went from Victorian cinched and military dress to what you would call modern,” Porter says. “If you look at that moment, what can we learn about the roots of clothing today?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/aug/22/secret-sexual-signals-bloomsbury-group-bring-no-clothes-charlie-porter-charleston">Continue reading...</a>

## Goodbye Riverdale, the teen drama that went all the way over the top

<p>The wild high school soap took in everything from drug addiction to time travel, a pulpy and self-aware ode to David Lynch’s America </p><p>Six and a half years ago, the CW filled a hole in its midyear programming schedule with a series that sounded like a parody of industry trends. “A gritty, supernaturally-tinged, firmly PG-13 reimagining of the Archie Comics mythos” was the clearest way to describe Riverdale to those incredulous about its existence. Smiley-faced comic-book icons Betty, Veronica, and Jughead had been turned into telegenic twentysomething teens with county-sized libidos in a show that was also a sprawling soap opera with a liberated relationship to reality, the finest specimen of its genre in its era.</p><p>Archie did much more than share a steamy car hookup with his teacher Miss Grundy in the pilot. Over the six-season broadcast run concluding with this Wednesday’s finale, members of the good-time gang went to war, escaped from a derelict mental asylum, traveled through time, hopped across multiple dimensions, braved the treacherous terrain of undergrad creative writing seminars, developed and kicked drug addiction, maneuvered through corporate espionage, staged multiple musicals, joined the FBI, made the acquaintance of Andy Cohen, and learned to appreciate the epic highs and lows of high school football. The mission drift from the first season’s purview of classroom intrigue blossomed into an absurd running joke, with life-and-death, fate-of-the-planet stakes often contrasted against despair over unrequited crushes or stress about prom. Cheryl Blossom arrived on the scene as the one-liner-spitting queen bee at Riverdale high, spent a while as a Grey Gardens-style shut-in, pivoted to a sapphic demi-deity, and will soon end her arc as the leader of an all-girl squad of greasers circa 1955.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/aug/22/riverdale-tv-show-ending-cw-archie-betty-veronica-jughead">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The perfected mafia state uses ostensibly legal procedures and insider loyalty to protect corrupt autocrats from accountability</p><p>Could there be such a thing as Trump indictment fatigue? Every week seems to bring a new set of charges; one might be forgiven for losing any sense of what’s what in the four major cases the former president now faces. (Of course, Trump himself has long perfected the art of sowing confusion through falsehoods in response to any criticisms, impeachments and now indictments – or, in the words of Steve Bannon, “<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/1/16/20991816/impeachment-trial-trump-bannon-misinformation">flooding the zone with shit</a>”.) What mitigates this risk, though, is that the different indictments illuminate very different aspects of Trumpism – and the way Trump operated as president, and now continues to operate in his campaign to regain the White House.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/1ccdf52e-1ba2-434c-93f8-2a7020293967.pdf?itid=lk_inline_manual_5">Georgia indictment</a> is particularly important: what many have long suspected – that Trump operates like a mafia boss – is confirmed by the ample evidence of Trump and his (increasingly bizarre and brutal) associates forming a criminal conspiracy to defraud the United States. Unlike mobsters, Trump used the power of the state itself to try to get his way, even if his making offers one couldn’t refuse ultimately failed. If Trump were brought back to power in 2024, there is every reason to believe that he would not only engage in all-out retribution for alleged wrongs against his political clan, but also erect what some observers describe as a mafia state.</p><p>Jan-Werner Müller is a professor of politics at Princeton University.

<p>The comic, who has survived cancer and once sleep-jumped through a closed hotel window, is bringing his Broadway smash about mortality to the UK. ‘I guarantee you’ll laugh,’ he says</p><p>For someone whose affably rumpled appearance suggests Matt Damon waking up from a nap, the comedian Mike Birbiglia is remarkably industrious. He is a film-maker (movies include Don’t Think Twice, a comedy about an improv group starring Keegan-Michael Key) and an actor (The Fault in Our Stars, Orange Is the New Black), and he recently played Taylor Swift’s avaricious son, who discovers at her funeral that he has been left out of her will, in the video for Anti-Hero. He also has a podcast, The Old Ones, in which celebrity guests pick apart his earlier standup routines, and another, Working It Out, in which they help him develop new material. “Like Tom Sawyer getting his friends to paint the fence,” as one guest, Nathan Lane, memorably put it.</p><p>Now the 45-year-old is bringing his latest show, The Old Man and the Pool, to the UK after a sell-out Broadway run. If he had his way, he wouldn’t reveal anything about it in advance. “I’d just say, ‘I wrote a show about mortality and I guarantee you’ll laugh for 80 minutes straight and sometimes people also feel emotions from it and – trust me – I think you’ll love it.’” He is speaking to me from his Brooklyn apartment, a large ceiling fan whirring sleepily above him so that it looks like his head has propellers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/22/standup-mike-birbiglia-sleep-jumped-broadway-smash-doc-heart-attack">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The favourite for the International Stakes started in humble company like Jamie Vardy but is impossible to oppose</p><p>Much has been made of the similarities between Paddington and Giant’s Causeway, Aidan O’Brien’s “Iron Horse” at the turn of the century, ahead of Paddington’s attempt to record a fifth consecutive Group One win in the International Stakes at York on Wednesday. Rather less attention has been paid to parallels with Jamie Vardy, the Leicester City striker, in his team’s title-winning 2015/16 campaign.</p><p>As Vardy racked up goals in 11 straight matches in the early weeks of the season, no match report was complete without a reference to his humble origins in non-league football. The fact that Paddington started his three-year-old season in a handicap similarly gets a mention after each fresh Group One success, and as yet, like the Premier League’s best defenders eight years ago, his rivals have not found a way to stop him.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/22/paddington-can-help-aidan-obrien-to-trainers-title-with-international-success-at-york-horse-racing-tips">Continue reading...</a>

<p>How did a mid-budget thriller about child trafficking become a box office smash? With a lot of help from conspiracy theorists, the US’s religious right and Donald Trump</p><p>It is the movie the “woke Nazis at CNN, the Washington Post and the Guardian” <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2023/07/10/nolte-pathetic-media-attacks-on-sound-of-freedom-driven-by-bigotry-and-fear/">supposedly don’t want you to see,</a> as well as the plucky little indie that has beaten giant franchises such as Mission: Impossible and Indiana Jones at the US box office. But although Sound of Freedom has, as of this weekend, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/15/sound-of-freedom-director-alejandro-monteverde-jim-caviezel-qanon-comments">taken nearly $178m (£139m)</a>, it is a particularly unlikely “surprise smash hit of the summer”. Had it been released five years ago, as originally intended, this mid-budget thriller might have sunk without trace. Instead, it has struck gold in these politically polarised, conspiracy-theory-addled times, boosted by Donald Trump, Fox News and the religious right, not to mention adherents of the wacko QAnon conspiracy theory. After its triumphant US run, it is now set for release internationally, including in the UK next week.</p><p>Ostensibly based on the true story of a US agent’s rogue mission to rescue trafficked children from Latin America, Sound of Freedom plays like a mix of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/11/sicario-review-emily-blunt-star-quality-lifts-thriller">Sicario</a>, Taken and Rambo, albeit with a more earnest and subdued tone.

## How to make the most of summer fruit | Kitchen aide

<p>Our panel suggests making creative use of spices for a host of sweet and savoury dishes to celebrate the annual summer fruit bonanza</p><ul><li>Got a culinary dilemma? Email <a href="mailto:feast@theguardian.com">feast@theguardian.com</a></li></ul><p><strong>What are the best fruit salads to make in summer?<br /></strong><em><strong>Sarah, Bradford, West Yorkshire</strong></em><br />There comes a point in summer when all meals point to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jul/25/wanted-savoury-ways-with-summer-fruit-kitchen-aide">fruit</a> – and to salad. Happily, berries, apricots, nectarines, melon and the like work well in both sweet and savoury recipes. That said, for Naz Hassan, head chef at <a href="https://www.pidginlondon.com/">Pidgin</a> in east London, peaches reign in savoury dishes: “They take salt well, the flavour profile can change completely once seasoned [especially if you add chilli] and the soft flesh absorbs flavour really well.” A good example is Hassan’s tamarind-peach salad, which he starts by sprinkling chunkily chopped peaches with salt “to release the moisture”. A dressing is then made by soaking tamarind “for at least two hours in lukewarm water, extracting the pulp from the flesh, then seasoning with salt and sliced bird’s-eye chillies”. Combine the fruit with the dressing and serve topped with fresh mint, coriander and thinly sliced ginger.</p><p>Laura Jackson, chef and co-owner of the canal-side <a href="https://www.towpathlondon.com/">Towpath cafe</a> in London, meanwhile, turns tomatoes and pickled melon into a summer lunch with some mozzarella. “Prep the melon, then salt it to get out any excess moisture. Next, make a simple 2:1 vinegar-to-sugar pickling liquor and, once that’s cool, pour it over the melon, seal and leave to steep.” Jackson suggests dressing chunks of the pickled fruit, tomatoes and cheese with a little of the melon pickling liquor – “It’s nice not to waste it” – then finish with some fresh tarragon or basil and a drizzle of olive oil. “The key is to use the most delicious, ripest fruit,” she adds. “You then don’t need to mess about with it too much.”</p><p>Got a culinary dilemma?

## UFC fighter Themba Gorimbo: ‘I saw people die in front of me at a very young age’

<p>The Zimbabwean had $7 left before he won a career-changing fight and film star Dwayne Johnson took him under his wing</p><p>“My life is a movie, directed by God,” Themba Gorimbo says while his lunch grows cold on a winter’s day in Harare. Gorimbo is back home in Zimbabwe, taking stock of the twists and turns of his dramatic past which meant he had just $7.49 (£5.88) left in his bank account before he won a life-changing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNamylgPXOs" title="">second fight in the UFC</a> as a mixed martial artist.</p><p>After his victory in Las Vegas in May, Gorimbo mentioned his perilous financial situation at the press conference and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson became involved. The controversial commercial relationship between Johnson and the UFC needs to be addressed but, for now, the feel‑good narrative depicts him being swept away by Gorimbo’s plight. Johnson’s production company is called Seven Bucks as he, too, was down to his last $7 when he set out on a career as a wrestler who eventually reinvented himself as one of the biggest movie stars in the world.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/22/ufc-fighter-themba-gorimbo-zimbabwe-interview-mma">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I’m 22, a virgin and scared. How can I get my confidence back?</p><p><strong>I am a 22-year-old ma</strong><strong>n who is still a virgin. I</strong><strong> have had three failed sexual encounters </strong><strong>in which I was with a girl I was really </strong><strong>into, but </strong><strong>couldn’t get an erection </strong><strong>because of stress and anxiety. In one </strong><strong>case, the girl </strong><strong>told all </strong><strong>her friends that I </strong><strong>couldn’t get an erection. I worked with a</strong><strong> lot of </strong><strong>them at the time and they </strong><strong>looked at me </strong><strong>different</strong><strong>ly after she told them</strong><strong>. It ate away at my confidence and </strong><strong>it still haunts me</strong><strong>. I often avoid </strong><strong>flirt</strong><strong>ing with women to prevent myself from getting into a similar situation </strong><strong>again. I am </strong><strong>healthy</strong><strong>, 1.8m (5</strong><strong>ft 10in) tall and weigh</strong><strong> 84kg (13st 3lb) </strong><strong>and I work in a physically demanding construction job, so I don’t think it</strong><strong> is a physical problem</strong><strong>. I believe it</strong><strong> is all in my head</strong><strong>. </strong><strong>Every time I get into a situation </strong><strong>in which I feel </strong><strong>as if I could have sex, I start sweating and </strong><strong>become very anxious.</strong><strong> What can I do to stop these invasive thoughts from destroying my sex life?</strong></p><p>Sex is supposed to be pleasurable and fun. Anxiety, fear and any type of performance or body concern can significantly reduce a person’s ability to enjoy intimacy and participate fully in love-making. It is really unfortunate that you were betrayed by someone whose indiscretion has further lowered your confidence, and has even made you avoid sex altogether.</p><p>Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</p><p>If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to <a href="mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com">private.lives@theguardian.com</a> (please don’t send attachments).

<p>Ordered to remove unsuitable books from their libraries, school administrators in Iowa outsourced the job to AI.

Of course, nobody wants hardcore porn in school libraries, but this sweeping bill, which also restricts education about gender identity and sexual orientation, isn’t trying to prevent that nonexistent problem: it’s about indoctrination.

<p>Takehiko Inoue’s classic manga spinoff has magnificent on-court scenes, but doesn’t quite sink the backstory</p><p>At the climax of this basketball-worshipping anime that was a huge hit across Asia earlier this year, the whole of space-time apparently comes to rest on a single bead of sweat departing the chin of one of the players. The entire universe is contained on a single court as Shohoku high school, whose five motley ballers were the main characters in the original manga, which ran between 1990-96, challenge the invincible national champions, Sannoh high. Fleshed out in 3D animation, the action – feinting, pivoting and occasionally soaring high above the stands – feels resplendently immediate.</p><p>Chaperoned by its original creator, Takehiko Inoue, after spending eons in development hell, this adaptation relegates Dennis Rodman-esque, red-cropped bad-boy Hanamichi (voiced here by Subaru Kimura) in favour of the more sensitive Ryōta (Shugo Nakemura) as protagonist. Ryōta’s got tragedy in his locker: his brother Sota – whom he idolised – was an even more gifted player but died in a fishing accident on Okinawa. Now it’s up to this pint-sized but cunning point guard to lift his team when they find themselves 20 points behind.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/22/the-first-slam-dunk-review-takehiko-inoue-manga-anime">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Chinese-American’s queer, multilingual painting’s used to be difficult to decode. But as a new retrospective of his politically prophetic work becomes a surprise summer hit, has his time finally come? </p><p></p><p>There’s a painting on show at the new Martin Wong retrospective that demands closer inspection. At first, the 1988 piece entitled Heaven depicts a circular wall, notable for the immaculate detailing on the brickwork. But gaze closer and you see a small black hole in the middle of the painting, a detail that gives the work a loaded queer subtext.</p><p>This is typical of the hidden depths to Wong’s work. A child of Chinese immigrants to America, his work explored and celebrated racial and queer identity, gleefully merged cross-cultural references and showcased Wong’s multilingual skills, including references to sign language. He has not always been easy to decode. Martin Clark, director of the Camden Art Centre, admits that there’s a certain cache that comes from being able to properly understand Wong’s work: “If you know, you know,” he says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/aug/22/prisoners-cruising-and-bruce-lee-how-the-world-caught-up-with-artist-martin-wong">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh<br /></strong>Schoolteacher-by-day Tothill’s foppish persona is a delight and his thesis, that hedonism died with the Reformation, is convincing</p><p>There are newcomers on the fringe delivering comedy in hand-me-down voices – and then there’s John Tothill, a rookie with a fully-formed persona that is all, and only, his own. What a treat to encounter it, in this blithely eccentric hour about pleasure, puritanism and England’s religious history.</p><p>In his day job, Tothill is a primary school teacher, and there’s something teacherly in the unlike-anyone-else demeanour he brings to the stage. Foppish, erudite, intellectually self-assured and effervescing like a freshly poured champagne, the Essex man launches straight into his thesis, which is that hedonism and transcendence died with the Reformation – but might yet be rediscovered in the nightclubs of Berlin. The problem is, he can’t keep the sermon on track, what with the audience being so gorgeous (“I’m <em>obsessed</em> with you”), his daily life providing such rich tangential material, and so many historical byways (“quickly on this …”) that make themselves impossible not to explore.</p><p>At <a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/john-tothill-the-last-living-libertine">Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh</a>, until 27 August.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/edinburgh-festival-2023+tone/reviews">All our Edinburgh festival reviews</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/22/john-tothill-the-last-living-libertine-review-bubbly-flirty-tangents-through-history">Continue reading...</a>

## Cinema this autumn looks sicker, and healthier, than ever | Peter Bradshaw

<p>The actors’ and writers’ strikes are worrying  – but #Barbenheimer showed there’s still a large, engaged audience hungry for good movies</p><p>In theory, everyone in Hollywood and everyone in the whole movie business should be on top of the world. So why aren’t they? Why is the industry ending the summer in such a jittery, neurotic state? Is Hollywood really on the verge of collapse?</p><p>There was, after all, every reason to look forward to this year’s autumn awards season with sky-high morale. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/24/barbie-oppenheimer-movie-release-box-office-ticket-sales">#Barbenheimer phenomenon</a> was a box-office smash beyond distributors’ wildest dreams. What started as a speculative hashtag joke has generated real returns for two very different movies: a fantasy-comedy about a doll and a searing epic about the father of the A-bomb. And even the attendant online debates – is Barbie just a glorified ad? Does Oppenheimer overlook the Japanese perspective? – have energised engagement with cinema. The movies have become important again and people have been brought back to the cinema in their biggest numbers since the pandemic. It also shows that original films from auteur directors can deliver numbers to match and even exceed any franchise.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/22/cinema-this-autumn-sicker-healthier-than-ever-barbenheimer-strikes">Continue reading...</a>

## How a Craigslist scam led me to home ownership at age 28

<p>I finally found a perfect little house in the countryside that was both affordable and accessible – but was it too good to be true?</p><p>The Craigslist rental listing was fresh, less than a day old. Gazing at the little cottage in north Georgia, I could practically see a halo around it. The area was rural but not too isolated, the streets tree-lined and hilly. At just 925 sq ft, it looked perfect for a singleton like me. The $700 deposit was also very manageable – much too low, in retrospect. But affordability was crucial for me as a self-employed writer whose income ebbs and flows.</p><p>You should know I was skeptical – it definitely seemed too good to be true. It was autumn 2021, well into this country’s <a href="https://www.fastexpert.com/blog/housing-market-after-covid/">pandemic real estate boom</a>.

<p>This is Tobe Hooper’s putrid amoral universe in film perfectly replicated as an interactive terror ride</p><p><strong>PC, PS4/5, Xbox; Sumo Digital/Gun Interactive</strong></p><p>It’s been 50 years since Tobe Hooper’s Texas Chainsaw Massacre lit up cinema screens with its propulsive mix of desolation, buzzing tension and extreme violence. Saw-wielding maniac Leatherface is still up there with Michael Myers and Freddy Krueger as one of the most iconic depictions of murderous evil that cinema has ever produced – so it’s strange we’ve had to wait this long for a game to truly get to grips with this seminal work of rural horror.</p><p>Like 2017’s Friday the 13th, which recently had its servers shut down for good, and the still hugely successful Dead By Daylight, Texas Chainsaw Massacre (TCM) is an asymmetric online multiplayer game, in which players take part as either victims or killers. In those titles only one player gets to be the bad guy, but in TCM, three participants play together as the film’s evil Sawyer family, working together to hunt down and slay their four desperate captives, who are all trying to escape. Among the victims, Connie can instantly pick locks and Leland can stun enemies, while on the family side the hitchhiker can set traps and new character Sissy can poison things. Players gain XP for upgrades after each round, whether their side wins or not.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/aug/22/the-texas-chainsaw-massacre-review-a-horrible-treat">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Injuries to key players can change sporting fates, while South Africa look much stronger with Siya Kolisi back in the side</p><p>Sporting perspective can sometimes be found in unlikely places. There we were, rubbing the sleep from our eyes around 5.30am en route to Dublin airport, when our taxi driver told us a poignant story. The youngest of 10 brothers from the tough side of town, his hobby was pigeon racing. His goal was to win one of the classic races in France, no easy task for Irish pigeons required to fly across several hundred kilometres of sea to reach their distant loft.</p><p>One year, one of his younger birds miraculously achieved the holy grail. There was now a rare opportunity to breed a long line of future champions. Or, at least, there might have been had one of his neighbour’s cats not crept in over the backyard fence. In the confusion it was not initially clear which of the 50-odd pigeons had been taken but, in his heart, their owner already knew which one it was. Sure enough, his irreplaceable wonder bird was gone, never to return.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/22/south-africa-england-new-zealand-ireland-rugby-world-cup">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Yes, Romeo the staffie has a lovely smile. But it hides such wickedness …</p><p>The note I have to leave for dog-sitters reads like a document from the previous, now deceased inhabitants of a haunted house. “Never, ever off a lead – nowhere is safe”; “If you see the boston terrier from next door, back away; if you see the husky from over the road, run – don’t walk”; “If you walk after 10pm, that is the hour of the fox, and will go hard on you unless you want to sacrifice the fox”. It is embarrassing, and my preference is to have the same dog-sitter who I’ve known since he was 10 and doesn’t need me to say all this twice. Plus, he remembers my last dog, so he knows that I’m not the problem. The dog is the problem.</p><p>Last weekend, he was away, so he got his friend to fill in. “I love dogs and haven’t been able to spend any time with one since I left Ecuador,” was her first message. Oh, lady, no: this is not that kind of dog. Among people, Romeo may exude a delightful, enthusiastic energy, and remind you of pleasant dog-related moments you have had in other lives. Around other dogs, he will remind you of the savagery that lives in even the sunniest heart; he’ll remind you that life is hard and the wages of sin is death. A bit later, she sent a video. He was sniffing a flower; he looked like Ferdinand the Bull, the gentle animated giant who didn’t want to fight, who only wanted to appreciate the botany. I mean, he didn’t look unlike a bull in the first place – he’s a bull breed – but this was different: this bull heralded peace.</p><p>Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/22/i-asked-a-strange-woman-to-look-after-my-dog-ill-admit-it-i-feared-the-worst">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Very much indebted to No Country for Old Men, punchy thriller brings damnation to smalltown Louisiana</p><p>Feature first-timer Nicholas Maggio makes an impression with this punchy crime thriller set in smalltown Louisiana. The director himself has cited Tarantino as an influence – though the borrowing is much more obviously from the Coens’ adaptation of Cormac McCarthy’s No Country for Old Men, with the seen-it-all sheriff and the sinister lizard-eyed killer coming in from the big city and making gas station attendants feel very uncomfortable by quizzing them insolently about their private lives.</p><p>John Travolta plays Sheriff Davis, a guy nearing retirement and trying not to think about the bad news he’s just got from his doctor. He takes a kindly interest in Shelby (Shiloh Fernandez), a young mechanic who is married with a young daughter; he soups up muscle cars and makes a few much-needed dollars at street races. But Shelby gets drawn into an incompetent criminal scheme hatched by his greedy and foolish uncle Trey (Kevin Dillon), who wants Shelby as the getaway driver while he robs an illegal opioid pill mill; goofy Trey figures there’s a big score of easy money.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/22/mob-land-review-kindly-sheriff-john-travolta-drawn-into-blood-soaked-plot">Continue reading...</a>

## Neil Maskell: ‘If me and Idris Elba got into a physical altercation, I’d last about a second!’

<p>From terrifying audiences in Kill List to squaring up to Elba in airline thriller Hijack, the actor has made his name playing a host of wrong’uns. Now he’s leaving the baddies behind to direct a Belgium-based whistleblower drama</p><p>If you know Neil Maskell as an actor, you might fancy you’d know him as a film-maker, too. And you’d be right. But you’d also be very wrong. “I think if you see<em> </em>Klokkenluider it’s not really the work of … ” Maskell pauses to determine where his directorial film debut diverges from his onscreen persona. “I was gonna say a ‘tough guy’, but that’s not very fair, because I know some very intelligent tough guys. But it’s not the work of, like, a<em> thug</em>.”</p><p>In fact, the title alone – a Dutch word meaning “whistleblower” – sets Klokkenluider above the violent Brit-flicks Maskell once starred in. He is calling today from Antwerp, where he lives with Belgian actor Sura Dohnke, his partner of nearly 12 years, and his family when he’s not in London, and it’s here in Belgium that he’s opted to set his first film as writer-director. It’s about a couple, Ewan (Happy Valley’s Amit Shah) and Silke (played by Dohnke), who are hiding out in an isolated holiday rental, having stumbled on some potentially world-shaking government secret. There they are joined by two shifty security professionals, Chris (Tom Burke of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/11/strike-troubled-blood-review-the-shows-real-hook-will-robin-and-strike-finally-get-together" title="">Strike</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/29/the-souvenir-review-joanna-hogg" title="">The Souvenir</a>) and Glynn (well-loved actor’s actor Roger Evans) to await further instruction from an unseen authority.

Yet no one saw her face in the hit film. Now 42, and an insurance agency owner in Philadelphia, Snitzer was Gwyneth Paltrow’s body double for the role of Rosemary in 2001’s Shallow Hal. While Paltrow wore a fat suit for scenes featuring her face, Snitzer’s body was used for closeups of Rosemary’s arms, torso and thighs.</p><p>At the time, 20-year-old Snitzer was a Los Angeles-based acting student with aspirations to become an actor or comedian. “Mostly, I just wanted to be funny,” she says. One day, a friend from her improv class called her up because he had heard about “this thing”.

<p>The YouTube singer’s US No 1 hit Rich Men North of Richmond rails against billionaires but punches down on the poor. So I decided to write a song in reply</p><p>‘Don’t mourn: organise” were the last words of the great union songwriter Joe Hill, framed on a murder charge and executed in Salt Lake City, Utah, in November 1915. A reminder to activists that the struggle carries on even though a strike may end in defeat, they’re also a handy maxim for anyone writing songs about the pressures that working people face. If you hope to inspire, rather than just providing a litany of problems, then it’s necessary for your song to offer some vision of redemption. While it is clearly beyond the scope of the songwriter to provide a cure for society’s ills, there is a role to play in calling out where you perceive the problem to lie and suggesting a possible way forward.</p><p>Joe Hill’s words came to mind when I heard Rich Men North of Richmond, a song posted on YouTube two weeks ago by Oliver Anthony, a young singer from Farmville, Virginia. The clip has since had 31m views. Yesterday it entered the Billboard charts at No 1, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/21/rich-men-north-of-richmond-us-chart-history">an unprecedented feat</a> for an artist with no prior recording history.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/22/oliver-anthonys-divisive-song-claiming-solidarity-with-workers-only-benefits-the-rich-who-exploit-them">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Power is addictive – as certain world leaders insist on showing – but standing down from politics aged 62 was the smartest decision I ever made</p><p>Some years ago, at an African Union conference in Addis Ababa, I heard the then UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, say to an audience stuffed with life presidents: “One of the tests of leadership is knowing when to leave the stage.” All the big offenders were present – Robert Mugabe from Zimbabwe, Omar<strong> </strong>Bongo from Gabon, Teodoro Obiang from Equatorial Guinea and Yoweri Museveni from Uganda. They sat stony-faced amid much nervous foot-shuffling and laughter as the chairman, the former president of Mozambique, Joaquim Chissano (one of the few African leaders who stood down when his time was up), pointed at them and said, “And we all know who Kofi was talking about, don’t we?” It was an electric moment.</p><p>Annan may have been talking about African presidents, but today his words might equally apply elsewhere.

<p>Diarmuid Hester’s travelogue celebrates the history of queer spaces in 20th century subculture, from Josephine Baker’s Paris to EM Forster’s Cambridge</p><p>Writing history or biography often feels like a journey – both a journey of discovery and a dogged pursuit of historical subjects who may or may not make it easy for you. This strange and entirely unreciprocated fascination has become something of a subject in itself, described in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/27/biography1">Richard Holmes’s tellingly entitled </a><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/27/biography1">Footsteps</a></em>, for instance; while in books such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/aug/11/echo-spring-olivia-laing-review">Olivia Laing’s </a><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/aug/11/echo-spring-olivia-laing-review">The Trip to Echo Spring</a></em>, in which Laing narrates her own travels around the US tracking some of America’s drunkest literary giants, the journey is made literal. Of course, research sometimes requires physical travel, but often it is instinct that sends researchers on pilgrimages to their subjects’ old haunts, seeking some intangible but significant information.</p><p><a href="https://www.diarmuidhester.com/">Diarmuid Hester</a>’s <em>Nothing Ever Just Disappears</em> is structured around eight different locations, most visited by the author, and leads the reader through “the queer spaces of the 20th century, the homes and haunts that have been central to subcultural art, writing and performance over the past 125 years”. Each locale is an opportunity to explore the life and work of an artist, writer or activist – EM Forster in Cambridge; the dazzling Josephine Baker in her beloved Paris; film-maker Jack Smith in lower Manhattan in the 1960s, and so on – but it is place itself that is of prime significance. Hester sets out to “examine the importance of queer places in the history of arts and culture… [to] explore their impact on queer identity… [to] reflect on the special relationship LGBTQ+ people have to space, and the ways in which places have been <em>queered, </em>their meanings distorted and appropriated”. It’s a project that seems particularly pressing as the number of queer spaces dwindles. Hester notes a 2017 study showing that 58% of London’s queer venues had closed down since 2006, and assumes that gentrification, plus the pressures of lockdowns, will have made things much worse. Why, he asks, do these places “seem to disappear so easily”?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/22/nothing-ever-just-disappears-seven-hidden-histories-diarmuid-hester-review-fascinating-journeys-into-lgbtq-courage">Continue reading...</a>

## The Innocent review – enjoyably French romcom heist caper

<p>A lonely young widower is drawn into a dangerous plot to pilfer caviar and negotiates pleasingly barmy plot twists</p><p>With his fourth feature directing, mop-haired actor-director Louis Garrel puts a French stamp on the Hollywood heist movie. The Innocent is a screwball romcom-caper starring Garrel himself as a guy who gets caught up in a plot to pilfer a job lot of caviar (you don’t get more Gallic than that). It’s a broad, enjoyable, lighthearted movie with a fair few not-insignificant plot holes, but a genuinely surprising storyline that keeps you guessing to the end.</p><p>Garrel plays Abel, a young widower, just 32, who’s been emotionally dormant since his wife died. Though he is is close to his mum, Sylvie, a charismatic, warm chaotic actor played with fizzing comic energy by Anouk Grinberg. Sylvie has a thing for bad guys; her latest squeeze is suave thief Michel (Roschdy Zem). They met in prison when she was teaching an acting workshop and he was banged up for a five-stretch. Head over heels, they get married and after Michel is released, open a florist together.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/22/the-innocent-review-enjoyable-romcom-heist-caper">Continue reading...</a>

## Our secret superpower! 16 amazing facts about sweat, from armpit transplants to artificial BO

<p>Why do we perspire? Do men do it more than women? Can you really ‘sweat out the toxins’? Here’s all you need to know</p><p>It’s getting hot again – and that means sweat. With the possible exception of Prince Andrew, humans are constantly producing “insensible perspiration” – the baseline level of sweat – to some degree. Despite that, we know surprisingly little about it. According to Sarah Everts, the author of <a href="http://saraheverts.com/" title="">The Joy of Sweat</a>, which explores the science, culture and history of sweat and our attempts to fight it, there is “a dearth of sweat research; there’s so much more fundamental research on every other body fluid”. So what do and don’t we know?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/aug/22/our-secret-superpower-16-amazing-facts-about-sweat-from-armpit-transplants-to-artificial-bo">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘A huge heart’: the insatiable activism of Zimbabwean exile Patson Muzuwa

<p>After agitating against Robert Mugabe in Harare in the late 90s, Patson Muzuwa fled to the UK. He continued the fight from afar, and became a tireless torchbearer for those he had to leave behind</p><p>In June, I visited a man named Patson Muzuwa in a care home in a former mining village near Durham. The centre had spacious bedrooms, friendly staff and an activity room decorated with a lifesize King Charles cut-out<strong> </strong>and union flags. At 56, Muzuwa was the youngest resident; most were elderly and had dementia. The local council had moved him here temporarily a few weeks before, after his medical needs made it impossible for him to stay with his son.</p><p>Muzuwa has lived at least 10 lives. As a young man in Zimbabwe, he became a member of the main opposition party to President Robert Mugabe’s autocratic rule and found himself hounded by security forces. After he resettled in the UK, he became a key part of the Zimbabwean community, organising resistance to Mugabe from abroad. Meanwhile, his personal life has veered between extraordinary highs and lows, and with his charm he has left a mark on almost everyone he has met. His story is a poignant reminder of the pain of political exile from your home country, and the challenges that face asylum seekers in the UK, even after they have been granted leave to stay.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/22/a-huge-heart-the-insatiable-activism-of-zimbabwean-exile-patson-muzuwa">Continue reading...</a>
