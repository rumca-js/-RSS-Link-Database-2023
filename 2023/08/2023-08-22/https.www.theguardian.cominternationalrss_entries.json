Once she had crossed the finish line, the 23-year-old went from confidence to self-doubt as she searched the stadium scoreboard for her time. And even after her 10.65sec \u2013 and her 100m world title \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/21/shacarri-richardson-wins-thrilling-100m-from-outside-lane\">was confirmed</a>, she still couldn\u2019t believe what had happened. Neither could anyone else, frankly.</p><p>In Budapest on Monday the American shocked the world, rallying past four of the fastest sprinters in history to win gold on the biggest stage outside the Olympics. This was after she scraped into the final and had to race from the outside lane as a result. Meanwhile, her Jamaican rivals Shericka Jackson and Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce \u2013 respectively, the world\u2019s top-ranked sprinter and a 10-time world champion \u2013 started their races from the middle of the track, much too far to see Richardson coming. As with Bolt, you can\u2019t help wondering how much faster Richardson\u2019s time could have been if she had run all the way through the tape \u2013 especially given her 0.07sec margin of victory. But what could have been hardly detracted from what is: a true redemption story.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/22/shacarri-richardson-world-athletics-championships-100m-victory\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/22/shacarri-richardson-world-athletics-championships-100m-victory", "date_published": "2023-08-22T22:27:23.007091+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "Women\u2019s World Cup: our writers hand out their awards from the tournament", "description": "<p>From the key matches and biggest moments to the future of the game, the best bits of the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup</p><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/30/colombia-caicedo-vanegas-germany-womens-world-cup-match-report\">Germany v Colombia</a> was a case of European giant v South American newcomer to the world stage.
