How many USB devices can be plugged into a PC at one time? It's a reasonable question, but the answer is more complicated than you might expect. We took 127 USB devices and plugged them in one by one until something broke. Then we took those same devices and reconfigured a few things to see if we can break it a different way. Just how broken do things get? Which limits get hit? How can you calculate YOUR maximum USB amount?
