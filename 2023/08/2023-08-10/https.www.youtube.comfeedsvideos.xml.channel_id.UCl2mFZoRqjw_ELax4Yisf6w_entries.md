I don't know how USB-C works - maybe you're right. Like most customers, I'm not very tech savvy - I *DO* know that the same dongle that didn't work with an A1706 Macbook worked fine with a Dell XPS 9530, and I don't feel like paying $70 at the time for a dongle.... https://youtu.be/NYVjIjBMx6o?t=733 and that's what most customers would observe as well. 

Error 53 isn't about security - that's why they got rid of it. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205628 Detailed explanation  at 6:52 here: https://youtu.be/MUifN6abtSI?t=411

Applecare is not always giving you a new device. You might receive a refurb. Refurbs can, at times, look like this https://youtu.be/AUaJ8pDlxi8?t=757

I am a soy, snake oil salesman! Yes, I suppose I have been, for fifteen years... this is all fake, right? :) https://www.google.com/search?channel=fs&amp;client=ubuntu-sn&amp;q=rossmann+group+repair#lrd=0x89c2599df1f192db:0x7c00ae6baafd593f,1,,,,
