Ireland Troubles. Half a century ago, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Niedermayer\" title=\"\">Thomas Niedermayer</a> was a German businessman living in Belfast. At Christmas in 1973, he was kidnapped from his home by the IRA, possibly to be <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/tragic-fate-of-the-niedermayers-a-sign-of-history-s-long-reach-1.1254117\" title=\"\">traded</a> for imprisoned bombers, and murdered. His body was found in a shallow grave in 1980. Ten years on, his widow, Ingeborg, took her own life. A year after that, the Niedermayers\u2019 younger daughter, Renate, killed herself. Another two years later, their elder daughter, Gabriella, did the same.</p><p>The Niedermayer murder, as detailed in the Face Down documentary, was vicious. For the family, the damage lasted for generations, creating new victims and further tragedies. The lesson is frighteningly timely. This week, the <a href=\"https://www.psni.police.uk/\" title=\"\">Police Service of Northern Ireland</a> mistakenly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/08/major-data-breach-involving-northern-ireland-police-officers-and-staff\" title=\"\">published an online spreadsheet</a> detailing the surnames, initials, ranks or grades, locations and departments of all current PSNI officers and civilian staff members. The spreadsheet was not taken down for three hours. Approximately 10,000 people were listed. The consequences could endure for decades.</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Two of them were early works that remain unpublished, while neither of the others was performed in his lifetime. Hulda, which Franck completed in 1885, was the first to be heard after his death, in a much-pruned version in 1894, but it has remained a rarity, little performed and only recorded complete for the first time in 2019, a performance in Freiburg that was subsequently released by Naxos.

Though the influence of Wagner is certainly clear in the score\u2019s chromatic harmonies, and the two big Tristan-esque love duets that are among its dramatic turning points, the structure of the work, in four acts and an epilogue, follows the pattern of a French grand opera, with set-piece arias, ensembles and choruses, and even a ballet at the beginning of the fourth act.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/10/franck-hulda-review-grand-guignol-operatic-curio\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/10/franck-hulda-review-grand-guignol-operatic-curio", "date_published": "2023-08-10T14:15:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Mouldy, damp house did not cause man\u2019s death, coroner rules", "description": "<p>Postmortem examination had found aspergillus on lungs of Luke Brooks, 27, who died at home in Oldham</p><p>A man who lived in a cold, damp and mouldy house did not die because of conditions in the property, a coroner has ruled.</p><p>Luke Brooks, 27, from Oldham, died at his home last October from an acute respiratory illness.

Over the years I missed that experience of creating music with other people. There\u2019s a literal component to acting and writing. You have to be faithful to the story, the words and who that person is. Music is much more abstract. There\u2019s a bit of magic to that, at least for me.

To experience that without expectation was very profound and overwhelming to the point where it\u2019s hard to take anything else in after that. The sonic weight of it, you\u2019re just so filled with it that that\u2019s enough of an experience for one night. When I saw the Smiths it was like that \u2013 The Queen is Dead tour, 1986, in the outdoor venue on Pier 86 [in New York]. The Queen is Dead was a very important record to me and my friends, and to see them live at that moment in time was magic. I felt like that when I saw Lou Reed for the first time, Patti Smith, Suicide. There used to be this very small but really important rock club in Hoboken, New Jersey: Maxwell\u2019s. Black Francis played solo while he was still in the Pixies, just him on electric guitar doing all Pixies songs. I got there really early and I was right in front of him.

Directed by Gerry Gregg, the film focuses on Niedermayer\u2019s granddaughters Tanya and Rachel, who grew up not knowing what had happened. But a shadow hung over their lives nonetheless: as children they were warned that no one in their family lived to be over 40, and when they were girls, their mother took her own life, as her own mother had done, 10 years after her husband\u2019s funeral.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/10/face-down-review-ira-abduction-documentary-thomas-niedermayer\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/10/face-down-review-ira-abduction-documentary-thomas-niedermayer", "date_published": "2023-08-10T12:38:54+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "At least 17 people dead after boat carrying Rohingya refugees capsizes off coast of Myanmar", "description": "<p>Search for survivors continues in latest tragedy as persecuted Muslims make perilous sea journeys in search of better lives</p><p>At least 17 people have drowned and 33 are missing after a boat carrying Rohingya refugees from Myanmar to Malaysia capsized on Monday.</p><p>The bodies of 10 women and seven men have been recovered after being washed up on the coast of Myanmar, said Bya Latt, a spokesperson for the rescue group Shwe Yaung Matta Foundation.

I paid \u00a3197 for replacements and sent the receipt to Reading borough council. It admitted breach of duty but has deducted 30% from my claim to reflect wear and tear. The affected tyres were relatively new and in good condition, but, since I don\u2019t have receipts from when I bought them, the council refuses to refund the full cost. I\u2019ve argued in vain that I should not be left out of pocket by its negligence.<br /></strong><em><strong>PJ, Reading</strong></em></p><p>Drivers up and down the potholed country will be making the same unhappy discovery. Council insurance does not include \u201cbetterment\u201d. That is to say, it doesn\u2019t cover replacing old items with new. So unless you can produce receipts showing that the damaged tyres had been bought very recently, the council will deduct a sum from a claim. A 30% deduction strikes me as arbitrary and unreasonable. Mileage and driving conditions, more than age, determine condition.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/aug/10/council-refused-to-pay-full-cost-of-replacing-two-pothole-damaged-tyres\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/aug/10/council-refused-to-pay-full-cost-of-replacing-two-pothole-damaged-tyres", "date_published": "2023-08-10T06:00:46+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "In our polarised politics, there are no truly independent MPs \u2013 and Westminster is poorer for it | Martin Kettle", "description": "<p>For voters, the choice is still between the established parties.
