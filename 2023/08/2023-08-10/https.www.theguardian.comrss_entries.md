<p><strong>Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh<br /></strong>Plumbing the realms of the unexpected, O’Neill plays both parts of a clowning double act, masterfully testing the limits of freak-out comedy</p><p>‘One banana, two banana, three / Is this the show you paid to see?” Well might Bill O’Neill ask. I’m not sure anyone thought they were paying to see <em>this</em>. From the realms of the wholly unexpected (albeit a mite more expected by those who’ve seen the work of O’Neill’s director, the in-yer-face clown <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/dec/02/nate-a-one-man-show-review-outrageous-and-electrifying-comedy">Natalie Palamides</a>) comes The Amazing Banana Brothers, this bizarro faux-circus act gone wrong by American import O’Neill.</p><p>A fresh-faced mischief-maker in a boiler suit with a malevolent leer, O’Neill plays both Kevin Calamity – who’ll slip on 1,000 banana peels, or your money back – and his brother and gopher, Joey. Think not so much sibling rivalry as sibling death spiral.</p><p>At <a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/bill-o-neill-the-amazing-banana-brothers">Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh</a>, until 27 August</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/edinburgh-festival-2023+tone/reviews">All our Edinburgh festival reviews</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/11/bill-oneill-the-amazing-banana-brothers-review-a-bunch-of-brilliant-gags">Continue reading...</a>

## Premier League: 10 things to look out for on the opening weekend

<p>Luton’s return to the top flight, a return of Everton’s anxieties and a big showdown at Stamford Bridge</p><p>Vincent Kompany’s old club provide a litmus test for his current one for the second time in six months. Burnley were storming towards the Championship title and unbeaten in 18 matches when pitted away at Manchester City in the FA Cup quarter-finals in March. Club officials, as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/08/people-were-telling-us-to-go-home-relegation-and-revival-at-burnley">new Mission to Burnley documentary</a> reveals, viewed the tie as a gauge of Burnley’s Premier League credentials while Kompany fired up his players with talk of Wembley. They were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/18/manchester-city-burnley-fa-cup-quarter-final-match-report">swatted aside 6-0</a>. There is no shame in a sound beating at the home of soon-to-be treble winners but Kompany will expect a more competitive display in the Premier League curtain raiser at Turf Moor. Burnley, who have made it nine summer signings with Sander Berge’s arrival from Sheffield United, have had players back in training since 5 June – five days before City <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/10/rodri-breaks-internazionale-resistance-to-seal-manchester-citys-treble-glory">won the Champions League</a> in Istanbul. They will hope the extra work at least reduces the gap on an all-conquering team that is already airing complaints about fatigue. <strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p><p><em>Burnley v Manchester City, Friday 8pm</em></p><p><em>Arsenal v Nottingham Forest, Saturday 12.30pm</em></p><p><em>Brighton v Luton, Saturday 3pm</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/aug/11/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-on-the-opening-weekend">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Summerhall, Edinburgh<br /></strong>Max Percy’s physical theatre show mixes ideas on sex, power dynamics and homophobia into an audacious reflection on generational trauma</p><p>Putting a shirtless young man on your advertising is never likely to harm ticket sales. It’s a truism that is addressed immediately by Max Percy, the 29-year-old dancer who is pictured sniffing a running shoe on the posters for his solo show Baklâ. He may be wearing a T-shirt right now, he reassures us as the lights dim, but don’t worry: it will be gone before the hour is up.</p><p>What sounds like a throwaway piece of comic flirting establishes a power dynamic that crackles throughout the rest of this devilishly smart physical theatre piece, which is named after the Tagalog term for a third gender, a word that doubles also as a homophobic insult. The audience is treated variously as co-conspirators, voyeurs, clients and finally something close to oppressors. The intimate lecture-theatre seating – four raked semi-circular rows overlooking the performance space – enhances the sensation that we are witnessing an anatomical dissection, but Percy laces his serious themes with teasing and tomfoolery.</p><p>At <a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/bakla">Summerhall, Edinburgh</a>, until 27 August</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/edinburgh-festival-2023+tone/reviews">All our Edinburgh festival reviews</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/10/bakla-review-this-teasing-tomfoolery-is-devilishly-smart">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Nordic Nightmare is determined to make the most of his late opportunity just seven days after his last contest</p><p>“I had just finished my fight last Saturday night and my manager came and said I have something to ask you,” says Robert Helenius as he details the strange twist that led to him agreeing to step into the ring against Anthony Joshua on Saturday night in London.</p><p>Helenius calls himself the Nordic Nightmare and he had just fought the 36th bout of his career when he beat his Finnish compatriot Mika Mielonen on a third-round stoppage. The fight was held in a 15th-century castle in Savonlinna, Finland, where they normally stage opera productions. Helenius was in a good mood as, having recorded his 32nd victory, he looked forward to taking his wife and children on holiday in Lapland this week.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/10/i-should-be-in-lapland-robert-helenius-anthony-joshua">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A chapter from Bram Stoker’s Dracula, set upon a ship, is expanded to a gory 2-hour film, an idea that works better in theory than in practice</p><p>As Universal continues to find creative ways to rework its iconic monster movies in the shadow of the iconically disastrous Dark Universe (a set of interconnected horrors cancelled after Tom Cruise’s Mummy wrapped up with a loss), there’s an alluring elevator pitch at the heart of their latest offering. Rather than retelling Bram Stoker’s Dracula in full once again, why not take one chapter, The Captain’s Log, detailing his journey on boat from Romania to England, and dig into what happened to the crew members he feasted on?</p><p>But coming just months after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/12/renfield-review-gory-fun-as-nicolas-cage-gets-his-teeth-into-dracula">Renfield</a>, this year’s other novel spin on Dracula, focused on the cursed count’s even more cursed aide, it’s another idea that works better as a logline than a full movie, stretched to breaking point in The Last Voyage of Demeter, a 2-hour film with frighteningly very little to feast on. It’s mostly fascinating for its existence, a gothic period horror made on an unusually grand scale, harking back to the days of Hammer, an outlier in a genre landscape that usually bets on smaller budgets aimed at a younger audience. It might explain why it’s taken two decades for the film to make it to the screen, a voyage through development hell that took in stars such as Noomi Rapace, Viggo Mortensen, Jude Law and Ben Kingsley and directors such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre’s Marcus Nispel, The Descent’s Neil Marshall and Flightplan’s Robert Schwentke. The script, originally written by Escape Room’s Bragi Schut Jr, has also seen multiple revisions with Bullet Train’s Zak Olkewicz receiving a co-credit and at least five other writers noted as helping with off-screen additional material.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/10/last-voyage-demeter-movie-review-dracula-horror">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The pressure is growing on Steve Borthwick to get more out of the crowd-pleasing talents that undoubtedly exist with his squad</p><p>With four weeks to go until the Rugby World Cup kicks off, the pressure is starting to ratchet up. Not in terms of warm-up results per se, but in how teams are looking to attack. This tournament is unlikely to be won by sides simply content to sit back and wait for opponents to make mistakes. On firm, dry pitches a cutting edge of some description, from first phase as well as turnover ball, is going to be essential.</p><p>In Australia Eddie Jones has clearly decided <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/10/michael-hooper-wallabies-captain-left-out-australia-rugby-union-world-cup-2023-squad-reports" title="">his Wallabies need further sharpening</a>.

<p>The police’s error is hard to forgive, but ministers must treat Northern Ireland’s wider human safety needs as a priority too</p><p>A new <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/10/face-down-review-ira-abduction-documentary-thomas-niedermayer" title="">documentary</a> film recounts a grim story from the Northern Ireland Troubles. Half a century ago, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Niedermayer" title="">Thomas Niedermayer</a> was a German businessman living in Belfast. At Christmas in 1973, he was kidnapped from his home by the IRA, possibly to be <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/tragic-fate-of-the-niedermayers-a-sign-of-history-s-long-reach-1.1254117" title="">traded</a> for imprisoned bombers, and murdered. His body was found in a shallow grave in 1980. Ten years on, his widow, Ingeborg, took her own life. A year after that, the Niedermayers’ younger daughter, Renate, killed herself.

This practice debases the high office they hold and, by extension, parliament itself. It seems we can no longer count on altruism and vocational motivation in our elected representatives. Therefore it’s time we professionalised the role of MP, to make the post-holder accountable to taxpayers and ensure that they provide excellent value for money. After all, we foot the bill for their wages, expenses and premises.</p><p>In most jobs, performance management is used, starting with a clear job description and professional standards to be met. For MPs, this should include mandatory attendance when parliament is sitting, participation in debates when important issues are being considered, giving speeches and answering constituents’ letters, making public appearances, and tackling casework. Annual appraisals, from which basic attendance data is made public and performance targets set, would enable constituents to decide whether they had made the right selection at the ballot box.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/aug/10/its-time-to-professionalise-our-underemployed-mps">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The children learn how to work in teams and to be self-reliant, show initiative and support others, writes <strong>Janet Kay</strong></p><p>I was taken aback by the letter about the UK contingent to the World Scout Jamboree in South Korea (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/aug/07/the-climate-cost-of-scouts-ill-judged-south-korea-jamboree" title="">7 August</a>), in particular its attack on the scouts involved and scouting in general. The writer implied that these scouts, “maybe a little less resilient than their predecessors”, had been whisked to air-conditioned hotels at the slightest sign of discomfort, when in fact the conditions that drove them out of the camp were grim.</p><p>Scouts who go on the jamboree have to raise the funds for their own air fares and prepare for the trip for at least a year before they go. They learn how to work in teams and to be self-reliant, show initiative and support others. They are far from all middle-class, and for some this will have been a once-in-a-childhood experience. With due respect to the plight of homeless children, it is also a strange for the letter writer to “wonder how many of them are currently in South Korea”. They probably won’t be in any of the other countries that thousands of parents have taken their children on holidays this summer either. The 4,500 UK scouts who went to the jamboree this year constitute a tiny proportion of UK child travel overall.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/aug/10/scout-jamboree-does-not-deserve-this-ill-judged-attack">Continue reading...</a>

<p>England beat Nigeria on penalties at the Women’s World Cup and while research has showed that going first can be decisive, there is a lot more to it</p><p>As soon as Millie Bright won the coin toss and chose to kick first in England’s last-16 World Cup penalty shootout against Nigeria, it became an advantage for the Lionesses. Even after Georgia Stanway missed the opening spot-kick, England still had a very good chance to go through and it is likely the players were aware of that.</p><p>“Before the penalty shootout starts, it is not a 50-50, rather a 60-40 advantage towards whichever team goes first,” explains Ignacio Palacios-Huerta, a professor at the London School of Economics who has long researched the science of shootouts. “The main advantage is going first, that is what this probability of winning is driven by.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/aug/10/how-to-win-a-penalty-shootout-womens-world-cup-england">Continue reading...</a>

But Kane is a remarkable player, an all-round striker who has scored at least 17 goals in every season since he became a first-team regular in 2014-15.

So many pitches. So many flights.

But when you have been riding it long enough, it needs to be the right kind of rewards and the right sort of memories.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/10/netherlands-spain-battle-of-substance-and-style-womens-world-cup-quarter-final">Continue reading...</a>

## Franck: Hulda review | Andrew Clements’s classical album of the week

<p><strong>Holloway/Montvidas/van Wanreij/Gens/Orchestre Philharmonique Royal de Liège/Madaras<br />(Bru Zane, three CDs)<br /></strong>Franck’s 1885 opera comes to life in a new recording based on concert performances. If the drama doesn’t convince, that’s not the fault of the superb cast</p><p><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Cesar-Franck">César Franck</a> composed four operas. Two of them were early works that remain unpublished, while neither of the others was performed in his lifetime. Hulda, which Franck completed in 1885, was the first to be heard after his death, in a much-pruned version in 1894, but it has remained a rarity, little performed and only recorded complete for the first time in 2019, a performance in Freiburg that was subsequently released by Naxos. This new version is based on concert performances in Belgium and Paris last year, and as ever with Bru Zane, it comes in a superbly furnished package, with informative essays and the complete French libretto and English translation.</p><p>Based on a play by the Norwegian Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson, Hulda is a bloody revenge tragedy, set in medieval times, in which the title character exacts revenge on the Aslaks, the family that has murdered her father and brothers and taken her prisoner. Though the influence of Wagner is certainly clear in the score’s chromatic harmonies, and the two big Tristan-esque love duets that are among its dramatic turning points, the structure of the work, in four acts and an epilogue, follows the pattern of a French grand opera, with set-piece arias, ensembles and choruses, and even a ballet at the beginning of the fourth act.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/10/franck-hulda-review-grand-guignol-operatic-curio">Continue reading...</a>

In the pro-coup demonstrations that followed, crowds waved Russian flags and chanted slogans against France, the country's former coloniser.

<p>The actor, writer and musician answers your questions on Buddhism, The Sopranos and his musical heroes</p><p><strong>You’ve said starting bands helped you come out of a period of dissatisfaction after </strong><strong>The Sopranos ended. Why do you think it had that effect?</strong> <em>laurasnapes<br /></em>Zopa started in 2006, the year before The Sopranos ended. I hadn’t played with other musicians in a while. Over the years I missed that experience of creating music with other people. There’s a literal component to acting and writing. You have to be faithful to the story, the words and who that person is. Music is much more abstract. There’s a bit of magic to that, at least for me. You don’t know where it’s coming from or where it’s going. And that’s very fun and satisfying.</p><p><strong>The first time you saw </strong><strong>My Bloody Valentine you had to leave afterwards because you were so blown away. Have you had a live music experience like that since, or recently?</strong> <em>dennylayne<br /></em>I went to see Dinosaur Jr and this band My Bloody Valentine was opening for them. They were on the Loveless tour. It was in Athens, Georgia, at a small club called the 40 Watt. To experience that without expectation was very profound and overwhelming to the point where it’s hard to take anything else in after that. The sonic weight of it, you’re just so filled with it that that’s enough of an experience for one night. When I saw the Smiths it was like that – The Queen is Dead tour, 1986, in the outdoor venue on Pier 86 [in New York]. The Queen is Dead was a very important record to me and my friends, and to see them live at that moment in time was magic. I felt like that when I saw Lou Reed for the first time, Patti Smith, Suicide. There used to be this very small but really important rock club in Hoboken, New Jersey: Maxwell’s. Black Francis played solo while he was still in the Pixies, just him on electric guitar doing all Pixies songs. I got there really early and I was right in front of him. I’ll never forget that.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/aug/10/michael-imperioli-i-still-give-morrissey-the-benefit-of-the-doubt">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The kidnapping and killing of Thomas Niedermayer by the Provisional IRA is given deeply moving family context and gripping historical background</p><p>In December 1973, two members of the Provisional IRA arrived at a house in West Belfast and told the man who came to the door that their car had crashed into his. He left the house in his slippers to see what had happened, and was bundled into a waiting car. His wife and two daughters never saw him again; for seven years, they had no idea whether he was dead or alive.</p><p>The man was called Thomas Niedermayer; he was a German who had come over to Northern Ireland to run a new electronics factory in 1961. The story of his kidnapping, and the terrible impact it had on his family, is told in this gripping documentary. It’s hardly a spoiler to say that Niedermayer ended up dead: the name of the film refers to how he was buried, in an unlovely woodland used by fly-tippers. Directed by Gerry Gregg, the film focuses on Niedermayer’s granddaughters Tanya and Rachel, who grew up not knowing what had happened. But a shadow hung over their lives nonetheless: as children they were warned that no one in their family lived to be over 40, and when they were girls, their mother took her own life, as her own mother had done, 10 years after her husband’s funeral.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/10/face-down-review-ira-abduction-documentary-thomas-niedermayer">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Regent’s Park Open Air theatre, London<br /></strong>This adaptation of the classic musical is a joy, from the faded nightclub set to Carl Mullaney’s showstopping I Am What I Am</p><p>Tim Sheader’s revival of the 1983 musical about a gay nightclub owner and his drag queen partner is a total joy. <a href="http://www.ryandawsonlaight.com/about">Ryan Dawson Laight</a>’s costumes dazzle; one skirt has its own set of wheels, another its own set of legs. Stephen Mear’s choreography is slick but – even better – very funny. Harvey Fierstein’s witty book still crackles 40 years on from the Broadway premiere and Jerry Herman’s heartfelt score (so pure and romantic) seduces us all.</p><p>Yet what is most striking about this memorable production, led by an all-queer creative team, is how authentic and truthful it feels. This is a show that has taken Herman’s astute lyric “what we are is an illusion” utterly to heart. La Cage aux Folles – a popular 70s St Tropez nightclub that has seen better days – is a little raggedy around the edges. Gold fades to green. Shrubs creep through the cracked windows. The singers pant and groan at the end of their big numbers and, when they’re done, watch the action from the wings.

If the script seems somewhat sober compared with the writer’s recent TV heights of I Hate Suzie and Succession, it remains an intellectually and physically intense experience, with subtle edits that sharpen and freshen the text for a stellar new cast. With heightened attention paid to breath, nerves and touch, The Effect ceaselessly questions which parts of our brains and bodies we can rely on and control.</p><p>In a drug trial for a new antidepressant, Tristan (Paapa Essiedu) and Connie (Taylor Russell, in her stage debut) fall in love, but the haze of the trial’s side effects make it impossible to tell how far their attraction is real. Essiedu and Russell are gorgeous together; she holds herself with a controlled stillness, a quiet confidence in her curiosity, while he is looser, bounding around, joking and flirting and quick to fly into fury. Within the claustrophobic space, they gravitate together, the glow of their faces as they lean into each other flooding the clinical stage with warmth.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/10/the-effect-review-lucy-prebble-intense-and-intoxicating-encounter">Continue reading...</a>

PragerU Kids was recently <a href="https://time.com/6301287/florida-prageru-education-schools/">described</a> by Time magazine as “a resource for schools”. But it is only a “resource” because the state of Florida has deemed it so. <a href="https://www.prageru.com/">PragerU</a> is not an actual university. It has no accreditation. It is a conservative media company whose goal since its founding in 2009 has been to spread rightwing ideology to adults and children.</p><p>And it has been incredibly successful at doing that. PragerU’s latest <a href="https://www.prageru.com/pdfs/prageru-2022-annual-report.pdf">annual report</a> says that the company’s self-described “edutainment” videos racked up more than 1.2bn views in 2022, with more than 7bn since its founding. Its content has been mostly available online, particularly on Facebook and YouTube, but now it is making its way into US classrooms with the promise of fighting the so-called “woke agenda”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/10/florida-wants-to-let-a-rightwing-group-teach-history-to-children-this-is-appalling">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From Attila the Hun to Genghis Khan, a vibrant account of how roaming warlords shaped technology, religion and culture</p><p>On the southern steppe of Ukraine in 512BCE, the envoy of Scythian King Idanthyrsus delivered a frog, a mouse, a bird and several arrows to Darius, mighty king of Persia. Then, without saying a word, he departed. Darius was confident the nomadic Scythians were pledging their allegiance. But his adviser understood the intended meaning. Unless the invading Persians turned into frogs and dived into the water, became mice and dug underground, or turned into birds and flew away, they would be riddled with deadly arrows as trespassers in the nomads’ land. Darius withdrew his soldiers.</p><p>For two millennia gigantic imperial armies were unable to defeat much smaller numbers of elusive horse archers who utilised tactics of surprise, feigned retreat and ambush rather than engaging in set-piece battles. In this book, which flows as fast as the nomads’ horses galloped, emeritus professor of ancient history Kenneth Harl chronicles the empires that roamed across the Eurasian steppe from ancient times to the death of Tamerlane at the beginning of the 15th century.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/10/empires-of-the-steppes-by-kenneth-w-harl-review-a-nomadic-route-to-civilisation">Continue reading...</a>

I felt as if I’d won the lottery.”</p><p>She didn’t join with the intention of making new friends, and describes herself as more of an introvert. “The house had turned into a bit of a pressure cooker with all my family at home,” she says. “My plan was to get my cold water fix and cycle back.” But she soon found herself striking up conversations with Juliet, who regularly swam during the same 9am slot as her.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/aug/10/how-we-met-you-have-interesting-conversations-when-youre-half-naked-and-cold">Continue reading...</a>

## Incredible But True review – screwball metaphysics on the property market

<p>Giddy comedy about middle-aged house hunters who find more in a bargain buy than anyone but director Quentin Dupieux could have dreamed</p><p>Those who have seen Quentin Dupieux’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jul/14/deerskin-review-jean-dujardin">strange comedy Deerskin</a>, with Jean Dujardin as a murderous would-be cinéaste obsessed with the sartorial superiority of his fringed deerskin jacket, or any of the film-maker’s other wacky adventures, will have an idea what to expect of this latest romp. They may also be justifiably unsure whether to find his movies irresistible or insufferable. I am still undecided in some ways. Incredible But True has a wacky premise that Dupieux very possibly had no idea how to develop. And yet I found myself laughing quite a lot of the time. The sheer silliness and zen pointlessness is entertaining. It’s a film with something of Charlie Kaufman or Spike Jonze or early Woody Allen, mixed with a French version of the Carry Ons.</p><p>Alain Chabat and Léa Drucker play Alain and Marie, a couple of middle-aged house-hunters being shown a shabby place in the suburbs. The estate agent perplexes the pair by excitedly showing them the house’s special feature: a hole in the basement that, through an interesting Escher-style quirk, leads down into the upstairs bedroom. You wind up higher than you were before. And not only that: the hole in the basement has a second, sensational magic power that astonishes them. The house is a metaphysical wonder at an affordable price. They buy it and Marie becomes obsessed with their house’s “duct”. Meanwhile, the couple’s near-neighbour, who is also Alain’s boss, has a problem: Gégé (Benoît Magimel) has had an electronic penis installed using untested Japanese technology and it is far from trouble-free.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/11/incredible-but-true-review-quentin-dupieux-berlin-film-festival-2022">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Emanuele Crialese’s drama of family dysfunction, starring Penélope Cruz, offers moments of glorious escapist fantasy</p><p>Emanuele Crialese’s film is a drama of family dysfunction and multi-generational unhappiness: a story of quiet desperation and secret yearning in the hearts of teens and the middle-aged alike. Hollywood might set something like this in the ’burbs. Crialese places it right in the centre of racy and prosperous Rome in 1970.</p><p>L’Immensità and its characters are reaching for something: some release, some consolatory epiphany, some immense personal revelation. And the gestures the film gives us along the way are intriguing, especially the glorious pop-choreography escapist fantasy sequences which are on a higher level of inspiration than anything else here. I don’t think L’Immensità quite encompasses what it’s straining for and I’m not sure that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/28/penelope-cruz-20-best-films-ranked">Penélope Cruz</a> is directed towards her greatest strengths, very good though of course she always is.

<p>Once upon a time you would have been deemed too old to be attractive – or described as a ‘Milf’ or ‘Dilf’. Now there’s a better term for those who are fit and over 40</p><p>The questions never to ask of TikTok are “why this?”, and “why now?” It marks you out as a person who will never understand, whose very concept of time is a bit last century. So, there’s a trend: if a person in their 40s or 50s, looking fit, ripped, rugged, with a confident bearing, a certain ease in their skin, appears on TikTok, there’ll be a swarm of comments underneath saying “beekeeping age”.</p><p>It derives from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp0N5PJxamE">a Rick and Morty episode</a> three years ago: Summer is hanging with her friend Tricia Lange, who’s watching Summer’s dad tend – or, if you like, keep – bees. She calls him sweet, she calls him dorky, she calls him “beekeeping age, I guess”, she lands on: “Summer, I want to fuck your dad.” A working definition: beekeeping age is anyone who should, on society’s cruel terms, be too old to be attractive, and yet is attractive anyway. Summer’s dad is actually 35, but let’s not dwell on the fact that, to gen Z, people in their 30s, 40s and 50s are pretty much interchangeable.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/aug/10/ripped-hot-and-in-your-50s-you-are-now-officially-beekeeping-age">Continue reading...</a>

## American Revolution: will the power of US money change soccer forever?

<p>The game is growing rapidly in America. But so is an awareness from those who see it as first and foremost as a business opportunity</p><p>From the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/16/lionel-messi-unveiled-as-inter-miami-player-in-front-of-crowd-of-thousands">curtains of rain at his unveiling</a> to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/21/lionel-messi-inter-miami-debut-free-kick-winner-cruz-azul">flawless top-corner winner</a> in the final minute of his debut off the bench and the video-game soccer on display in his first start in flamingo pink, Lionel Messi’s beginnings in Miami have seemed providential, almost biblical. Messi is not, of course, the first aging superstar to put himself out to pasture on the gentle greens of US soccer. Pelé set the precedent, and many will follow once Messi has gone. But to choose America now? In this economy? With Saudi Arabia’s gushing riches within reach, and the lure of nostalgia calling him back to Barcelona? Surely that says a lot.</p><p>Or perhaps it says nothing. For every charitable reading of the Messi-provided tea leaves today, an opposite and proportionately negative interpretation also seems plausible: the downpour at Messi’s unveiling was proof of the idiocy of running a soccer league through <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/apr/10/weather-mls-snowstorms-sun">the extremes of the American summer</a>, the PlayStation skills Messi treated us to in his first MLS start was only possible thanks to Atlanta United’s Commodore 64 defending, and so on. But Messi is Messi, even at 36: an argument all to himself and a divinity in any league. The arrival on these shores of a player uniquely able to shape the game to his will seems to portend the creation of a new reality for American soccer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/10/american-revolution-will-the-power-of-us-money-change-soccer-forever">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The second novel from one of Granta’s Best of Young British Novelists is a study of power, exile and dislocation</p><p>From <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/30/100-best-books-robinson-crusoe" title="">Robinson Crusoe</a> onwards, the literary island is always a microcosm. Islands, the smaller and more isolated the better, offer novelists the conveniences of the closed room, the small scale; politics distilled to a manageable number of characters; the distance between cause and effect, behaviour and consequences, necessarily and usefully short. Strangers at the Port by Lauren Aimee Curtis, one of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/15/grantas-best-of-young-british-novelists-meet-the-class-of-23" title="">Granta’s Best of Young British Novelists</a>, is set on an island where patriarchy has gone a little beyond realism – rather like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/23/the-water-cure-by-sophie-mackintosh-review" title="">Sophie Mackintosh’s The Water Cure</a>, though it stops short of Mackintosh’s outright dystopia.</p><p>The island is unnamed but firmly located near Sicily by reference to The Odyssey and the Napoleonic War. The historical setting at first seems unsettled. Subsistence farming, homespun clothes and lo-tech living suggest a range of several centuries, and the vaguely archaic diction of the opening pages indicates earlier times. As the detail accumulates – a quarry, soldiers, a gramophone, a man in a yacht – it seems to imply a specific set of events off stage, but the narrative remains coy about its relationship to global affairs. The grape harvest fails. A prison colony comes and goes. At the end, the inhabitants emigrate to Australia on overcrowded and insanitary ships, at which point the well-informed reader might see that the story unfolds in the context of the phylloxera epidemic which destroyed the Mediterranean wine trade and triggered mass migration in the late 19th century.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/10/strangers-at-the-port-by-lauren-aimee-curtis-review-an-island-controlled-by-men">Continue reading...</a>

<p>AI’s potential is huge and terrifying. But a new generation of artists is starting to find new uses for the technology, as well showing its many limitations</p><p>When I visited the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in early June, a fabulous drag cabaret was in full swing. Across seven small screens and a large wall projection, a rotating cast of performers in an array of bold looks danced and lip-synced their hearts out to banger after banger. Highlights included Freedom! 90<em> </em>by George Michael, Five Years<em> </em>by David Bowie and Beyoncé’s Sweet Dreams<em>.</em></p><p>Then the whole thing started again. And again. But this wasn’t just a video installation running on a loop: it was an elaborately engineered deepfake. Between each song, the performers underwent a kind of metamorphosis, melting down into amorphous masses of pixels and then re-forming with new faces and figures. For these AI-generated drag kings and queens, life really is a cabaret.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/aug/10/artists-using-artificial-intelligence-science-gallery">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This powerful film rails against a legal system that so often fails victims of sexual assault. It is a vivid, intimate – and ultimately redemptive – look at trauma</p><p>In March, the BBC aired W Kamau Bell’s thought-provoking four-part series, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/26/we-need-to-talk-about-cosby-docuseries-w-kamau-bell">We Need to Talk About Cosby</a>, which saw the standup and author interviewing a wide range of people. He asked them what it means to have grown up with Bill Cosby, once affectionately known as “America’s Dad”, and what it means to grapple with that now, when <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/06/15/1182542767/cosby-sexual-assault-lawsuit-nevada#:~:text=Last%20year%2C%20Cosby%20was%20ordered,continues%20to%20deny%20all%20allegations.">more than 60 women</a> have come forward to accuse him of sexually assaulting them. It was a cerebral documentary about race and culture, and it was, as the title promised, a difficult conversation about a very public figure.</p><p>Now, here is The Case Against Cosby, which takes a much more straightforward true-crime approach. This two-part documentary is based on The Moment, a memoir written by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/31/i-knew-bill-cosby-was-going-to-try-to-ruin-me-andrea-constand-on-her-14-year-fight-for-justice">Andrea Constand</a>, who is the only woman able to gain a conviction against Cosby, on three counts of aggravated sexual assault. The story is told from the perspective of several other survivors, and at times, it is aimed directly at anybody who has survived sexual assault. But Constand is at the heart of this, and she describes her experiences with Cosby with courage and utter clarity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/aug/10/the-case-against-cosby-review-a-revelatory-story-from-the-woman-who-brought-him-down">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This feminist reimagining of the fierce and witty Eileen O’Shaughnessy strips her of agency all over again</p><p></p><p>There’s a line of poetry that’s been bobbing about at the back of my head for at least 30 years: “It can’t have been fun for the Buddha’s wife, Left on her own for the rest of her life.” <a href="https://ramrowriter.com/2023/01/08/the-buddhas-wife/" title="">Ruth Silcock’s poem</a> bemoans the fate of the wives of Great Men, sidelined or neglected while their busy husbands are exalted. By the 1990s, the idea that the role of wife represented an aspect of patriarchal oppression was pervasive and uncontroversial. Hardly surprising: it had been a cornerstone of feminist thought ever since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/feb/07/charlotte-perkins-gilman-yellow-wallpaper-strangeness-classic-short-story-exhibition" title="">Charlotte Perkins Gilman</a> lifted the lid on wifedom and servitude with Women and Economics in 1898 or, for that matter, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2015/oct/05/original-suffragette-mary-wollstonecraft" title="">Mary Wollstonecraft</a> insisted women were more than male property in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman back in 1792.</p><p>I’ve been wondering lately if feminism is subject to a Groundhog Day-style curse in which all previous knowledge is periodically obliterated. In 2017, the writer Anna Funder, best known for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jun/27/germany.books" title="">Stasiland</a>, found herself bitterly metabolising the revelations of #MeToo, cognisant for the first time that she as a wife had taken up the lion’s share of parenting and housework. She turned to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/georgeorwell" title="">George Orwell</a> for insight into her oppression, only to discover lurking in the shadows the emblematic figure of his wife, Eileen, whose story she seizes on as a way of exorcising her feelings.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/10/wifedom-mrs-orwells-invisible-life-by-anna-funder-review-inside-a-troubled-marriage">Continue reading...</a>

In the early 1960s, the Hawks backed the Arkansas-born frontman Ronnie Hawkins, touring the US and Canada and cutting a few studio singles. One of these records, a cover of Bo Diddley’s Who Do You Love?, reveals Robertson to be a lithe blues guitarist with a smouldering tone and a knack for shaping his livewire riffs around Hawkins’ wildfire vocals and the rest of the band. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYPVyJwzerM">The Last Waltz version of this song</a>, featuring an exuberant reunion of Hawkins with the now-veteran players, is just as good.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/10/robbie-robertsons-10-best-recordings-from-bob-dylan-to-the-band">Continue reading...</a>

## Council refused to pay full cost of replacing two pothole-damaged tyres

<p>It is deducting 30% ‘wear and tear’ unless I can find a receipt</p><p><strong>My car hit a pothole, which shredded two tyres. I paid £197 for replacements and sent the receipt to Reading borough council. It admitted breach of duty but has deducted 30% from my claim to reflect wear and tear. The affected tyres were relatively new and in good condition, but, since I don’t have receipts from when I bought them, the council refuses to refund the full cost. I’ve argued in vain that I should not be left out of pocket by its negligence.<br /></strong><em><strong>PJ, Reading</strong></em></p><p>Drivers up and down the potholed country will be making the same unhappy discovery. Council insurance does not include “betterment”. That is to say, it doesn’t cover replacing old items with new. So unless you can produce receipts showing that the damaged tyres had been bought very recently, the council will deduct a sum from a claim. A 30% deduction strikes me as arbitrary and unreasonable. Mileage and driving conditions, more than age, determine condition.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/aug/10/council-refused-to-pay-full-cost-of-replacing-two-pothole-damaged-tyres">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For voters, the choice is still between the established parties. A more rational politics remains tantalisingly out of reach</p><p>It’s always good to be an independent thinker, right? You can make up your own mind rather than follow the fashion. You trust the facts more than the dogmas or the vogue. You think sensibly, around corners. You call out emperors with no clothes, and warn against the folly of the crowd.</p><p>Well, maybe. But when it comes to politics, being an independent is more complicated in practice. In particular, it depends on the circumstances and the political system. To be an independent is very important in times deadened by orthodoxy. It matters just as much in times of polarisation, when those in the middle struggle to have a voice. But when something big is at stake, the independent reflex can seem a bit precious, or worse. So, how does all this apply in 2023?</p><p>Martin Kettle is a Guardian associate editor and columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/10/politics-independent-mps-westminster-voters-parties">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The actor’s role as the head of the company behind the opioid crisis isn’t the most rewarding, but this drama is furious, unflinching TV. Its horrifying story should be heard again and again</p><p>There is a pretty good argument for saying that you have seen the new Netflix drama series <a href="https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81095069">Painkiller</a> before. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/nov/12/dopesick-review-the-heinous-truth-behind-americas-opioid-emergency">Disney+ drama Dopesick</a> covered the same ground and many of its beats are familiar. Both are fictionalised accounts of real and composite people and events at the heart of the opioid epidemic unleashed by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/27/empire-of-pain-patrick-radden-keefe-sackler-opioid-crisis-oxycontin">Sackler family</a>’s company’s invention and relentless marketing – from the late 90s onwards – of a new drug called OxyContin. Both weave the story of one “typical” individual’s gradual addiction to their prescribed medication (in Dopesick a young woman hurt in a mining accident, in Painkiller a 30-something family man called Glen, played by Taylor Kitsch, who is injured during his work as a mechanic) through the bigger legal picture, presented through similar framing devices. Dopesick had Michael Keaton as a doctor testifying at a court hearing about OxyContin’s effect on him, his patients and their community. Painkiller has Uzo Aduba as Edie Flowers, an investigator with a US attorney’s office in Virginia – home to plenty of the kind of rural, working class and economically deprived communities that were the prime targets for the pushers of the new product. “People,” as Flowers puts it, “in pain and with no option but to get better.”</p><p>She is one of the first to spot the pattern of overprescription and abuse of the drug. Her explanation of the crisis to a law firm about to start a mass civil claim against Purdue Pharma – the company making OxyContin and owned by the Sacklers – roots us in the present and sparks flashbacks to pivotal points in the drug’s awful story.</p><p>Painkiller is on Netflix</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/aug/10/painkiller-review-matthew-brodericks-character-is-just-evil">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Move forward. Flap around a little!’ How learning to swim at 60 set me free

<p>My body and my confidence were failing me. I was told swimming would make me fit and strong-minded. But first I had to navigate the aggravation of the slow lane</p><p>I ended up at the YMCA as a last resort. Years of chronic neck and back spasms had stolen all the variety and fun I used to find in working out, especially that amped-up endorphin high. By my early 50s, I had spent thousands of dollars trying to mitigate this pain with alternative treatments, after burning through one routine after another: running, kickboxing, spinning, kung fu, weight training, aerobics, Zumba, walking, children’s karate, even alternative therapy such as the Feldenkrais Method. And yet knots clung to my spine like barnacles and flared up after such innocuous activities as doing the dishes or just sitting funny.</p><p>Once strong enough to propel me through the air in handsprings, sprint down a track and dodge oncoming players in rugby, my muscles had begun to atrophy by age 30. A physiotherapist told me then that it is not uncommon for dancers or gymnasts to remain hyperflexible as they age, but the brain thinks something is amiss when there’s too much rubbery movement, so it orders everything into lockdown. It’s the brain’s way of keeping you safe, even though you feel horribly unsafe because you’re in a spasm. I haven’t been able to do a sit-up for decades, since the year my mother died, one year before I was pregnant. That was 20 years ago.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/aug/10/how-learning-to-swim-at-60-set-me-free">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Unable to get to Italy, I spent a day recreating a Venetian mini-break in my home town. Who needs the Grand Canal when you’ve got the Ouse?</p><p>One of the happiest times of my life was the month I spent in Venice last year. I’m desperate to go back – when I die, I want to be reincarnated as one of those well-fed Venetian seagulls – but it’s not on the cards, financially or practically. Thankfully I live in York, which is also very old and full of locals complaining about tourists. Could I have a Venetian adventure right here?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/aug/10/dream-holiday-at-home-how-i-holidayed-in-venice-without-leaving-york">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The act of burning a holy book in Sweden is not of itself illegal. But a spate of burnings has resulted in outrage at home and abroad – and potentially far-reaching consequences. Miranda Bryant reports from Stockholm</p><p>If you want to publicly burn a holy book in Sweden, first you must apply for a permit. On payment of a small fee you are then free to incinerate a Bible, a copy of the Bhagavad Gita or, yes, the Qur’an.</p><p>As <strong>Miranda Bryant </strong>in Stockholm<strong> </strong>tells <strong>Michael Safi, </strong>Sweden’s extremely liberal freedom of expression laws allow for the causing of extreme offence. And the backlash to recent instances of Qur’an burnings has ballooned out of control. Sweden is facing diplomatic pressure from the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, which represents 57 countries. At the same time it is fretting over the support of Turkey to allow it to become a full Nato member. And at home, the issue is highlighting the government’s reliance on the support of a far-right party to keep functioning.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/audio/2023/aug/10/the-quran-burnings-in-sweden-who-is-fanning-the-flames-podcast">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The bandleader who didn’t front his band, who was never as celebrated as Bob Dylan or their peers, was the glue keeping the Band together</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/09/robbie-robertson-band-dead-age-80">Robbie Robertson, member of the Band, dies at age 80</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/08/robbie-robertson-the-band-dylan-guitarist-heroin">A 2019 interview: ‘I didn’t know anybody who didn’t do drugs’</a></li></ul><p>Robbie Robertson existed in a world of his own: a bandleader who didn’t front his band; a songwriter who needed the voice of others to bring his creations to life; someone who was intimately involved as first Bob Dylan and then the Band reached the zenith of their artistry, helping to reconfigure the possibilities of rock’n’roll twice within three years, without ever being quite as celebrated as artists who plainly regarded him as their peer.</p><p>His legacy will endure as a songwriter, above all. Robertson was fortunate to have Levon Helm, Rick Danko and Richard Manuel to interpret the songs he wrote for the Band, especially across their stellar opening trio of albums: Music from Big Pink, The Band and Stage Fright. Robertson, a Canadian, captured in both his musical and lyrical choices an imagined American South – one that could have been captured only by someone besotted with, but not born of, the complications of history.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/10/the-band-robbie-robertson-captured-a-dream-of-what-america-was-is-and-might-be">Continue reading...</a>
