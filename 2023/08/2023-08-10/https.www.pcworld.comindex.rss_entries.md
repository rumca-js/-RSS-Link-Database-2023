<p>To celebrate its ongoing relationship with Bethesda&rsquo;s upcoming <em>Starfield</em>, AMD is unveiling something every gamer will probably want to have: limited-edition Ryzen CPUs and GPUs, with <em>Starfield</em> branding.</p>



<p>AMD is manufacturing 500 AMD Limited Edition Ryzen 7 7800X3D chips in a custom <em>Starfield</em> box, as well as a similar number of Limited Edition Radeon RX 7900 XTX graphics cards &mdash; where the <em>Starfield</em> design is actually part of the heat shield. AMD&rsquo;s promotional video says that the two must-have tech items aren&rsquo;t for sale &mdash; you&rsquo;ll have the chance to win your own over the &ldquo;coming days.&rdquo;</p>



<p>AMD has heavily promoted its ties to <em>Starfield</em> for weeks now; on Amazon, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/A9A6019E-9120-4263-9B43-05F025C4E459?ingress=0&amp;visitId=676d8dda-a72e-4eb5-9fe6-93fb90121fb5&amp;xcust=2-1-2027858-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">AMD has offered a <em>Starfield</em> bundle</a> that kicks in when you buy a specific AMD processor and/or GPU. (<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amd.com/en/promotions/starfield-bundle&amp;xcust=2-1-2027858-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Similar deals</a> are offered from other retailers.) AMD has also promoted various component configurations to optimize the <em>Starfield</em> experience, with a &ldquo;Legendary&rdquo; configuration using the 7800X3D and the RX 7900 XT in conjunction with an AMD motherboard. It&rsquo;s this last configuration that you&rsquo;ll be able to emulate if you score yourself one of these limited-edition bundles.</p>



<p>To be fair, there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be anything new and unusual in the Limited Edition offering&rsquo;s engineering; the CPU appears to be clocked at the standard speed, and the 7900 XTX looks like an ordinary three-fan design. But much like the custom Xbox designs that Microsoft periodically releases to celebrate new games, AMD (and whoever its partner is) appears to have spent a lot of detail work in polishing the card, with callbacks to the game all over the place. You&rsquo;ll want a transparent case for this!</p>

<p>We&rsquo;d expect some of these cards will make it into the hands of popular AMD partners and YouTube personalities, of course. Stay tuned to find out how you can get one, too. </p>

## Google Docs and Drive now natively support eSignatures

<p>Electronically signing legal documents can be a bit of a pain. Unlike their paper counterparts, which are self-contained, you often have to hop into different browser tabs to get everything signed, initialed, and dated properly&mdash;especially if you&rsquo;re working within Google Docs and Drive. But that&rsquo;s soon to change with Google&rsquo;s announcement of eSignatures support in Docs and Drive moving out of alpha testing into a beta phase.</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/10/23826970/google-docs-drive-esignature-support-beta&amp;xcust=2-1-2027826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">The Verge</a>, Google Workspace Individual subscribers now have direct access to the open beta. Meanwhile, administrators for &ldquo;select Google Workplace&rdquo; accounts (a pool that includes some Business, Enterprise, Education, and Nonprofit customers) can sign up for the beta via <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeLyjTyUbm9cJ4f-IhWMte6w3ESyGYKmKPA8kKXhEbKSKGbJw/viewform&amp;xcust=2-1-2027826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Google&rsquo;s request form</a>. This wider availability comes a little more than a year after Google&rsquo;s initial introduction of eSignatures in June 2022.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Google Docs eSignature feature (light mode)" class="wp-image-2027832" height="750" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/esig2.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A screenshot of inserting signature fields into a document.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Google</p></div>



<p>Workplace subscribers with access to the eSignature feature will be able to request signatures, see the status of pending signatures, and view completed contracts. According to The Verge, you can add form fields for both full signatures and initials to documents, as well as a &ldquo;date signed&rdquo; box that can be set to auto-fill. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/08/esignature-google-docs-google-drive.html&amp;xcust=2-1-2027826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Google also teased</a> several upcoming features: audit trails, multiple signatures on a single document, signatures from non-Gmail users, and adding eSignatures to PDF files.</p>



<p>eSignature support began rolling out for Google Workspace Individual users on August 8, though Google says it can take up to 15 days for the feature to appear for everyone. For Workspace customers, applications for the beta start now, with approval and activation of the feature to happen over &ldquo;the next several weeks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s still no word on if this feature will ever come to consumer accounts&mdash;so if you don&rsquo;t have a Workspace plan (and don&rsquo;t intend to subscribe), you&rsquo;ll have to use an alternative method to capture electronic signatures. There&rsquo;s always still the tried-and-true method of using <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407214/best-pdf-editors.html">a PDF editor</a>, for example.</p>

<p>A virtual private network (VPN) service can help safeguard your identity, location, and keep your activities online anonymous. There are a few things you&rsquo;ll want to consider when looking for a VPN. It should be able to keep your internet usage private and secure. Speed is also important&mdash;privacy and security are crucial, but not at the expense of crippling your internet speed. If you&rsquo;re concerned with anonymity, you should also look for a VPN with data collection policies that are clear and transparent. Finally, the number of available servers and country locations a VPN offers is important if you are trying to get around region locks.</p>



<p>We have tested numerous VPNs and curated a list of the very best from a variety of categories so you can choose the perfect VPN service for your needs. Whether your primary concern is anonymity, streaming your favorite shows from another country, speeds, or price, we&rsquo;ve got picks for each category. Below our picks you&rsquo;ll find information about how we test and what to look for when choosing a VPN on your own. </p>



<p>Granted, not everyone wants or needs a premium VPN service&mdash;although if online privacy is important to you, we think it should be a priority. You might just want a VPN for occasional use such as when you&rsquo;re using public Wi-Fi, for instance. If that&rsquo;s the case, check out our roundups of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/633008/the-best-free-vpn-for-chrome.html">best free VPNs for Chrome</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/634025/best-free-vpns-for-windows.html">best free VPNs for Windows</a> for our recommendations, and caveats about a free VPN&rsquo;s limitations.</p>



<p><em><strong>Updated 8/10/2023: </strong>We&rsquo;ve added Private Internet Access as our best VPN for split-tunneling. This outstanding VPN not only has one of the best feature sets on the market, but it&rsquo;s also one of the most flexible. Read more about his great new pick in our summary below.</em></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to select the best overall VPN. Some services are weaker on privacy, but are significantly easier to use with tons of features, while others could stand an interface redesign.</p>

<p>For many years we chose the best VPN based purely on privacy, but that is no longer the sole concern of most people when choosing a VPN. Privacy is important, to be sure, but so are performance, extra features, a wide country selection, and ease of use. ExpressVPN has it all, making it our top choice for VPNs. ExpressVPN is one of the fastest VPNs we&rsquo;ve tested, and it has a very easy-to-use app. Its servers are all diskless, running everything in RAM&mdash;a welcome practice that&rsquo;s become fairly standard these days. ExpressVPN also has wide device support, as well as a smart DNS feature for set-top boxes, consoles, and more. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not the cheapest VPN out there, but you do get solid value for the price, and the service is regularly bringing in third-party auditors to bolster its privacy credentials.</p>

<p>Just like our top pick, NordVPN is also an excellent choice. Nord is arguably more feature-filled than ExpressVPN even, and the service is just one part of a larger suite of privacy- and security-focused products. The desktop app is very easy to use and offers a ton of different features including access to the TOR network over VPN, multi-hop VPNs, Meshnet, and a security suite complete with ad and malware blocking. </p>

<p>NordVPN has also gone a long way to bolster user trust with a now thrice independently verified no-logs policy and increased company transparency in recent years. The service also carries out vendor assessments and uses diskless servers for increased security. Their speeds are also outstanding, reaching an average of 73 percent of the base internet speed in our test across all servers. The only reason we placed them second is due to the price of the service, which is more expensive than ExpressVPN for a similar feature-set. Still, you can&rsquo;t go wrong if you decide to go with NordVPN as your VPN of choice.</p>

<p>As Hotspot Shield is to speeds, so Mullvad is to privacy and anonymity. We&rsquo;ve never seen another VPN that actively resists knowing who you are the way Mullvad does. Mullvad doesn&rsquo;t ask for your email address, name, or anything else. Instead it assigns a random account number that acts as your identifier and login. Mullvad accepts payments using standard methods such as credit cards and PayPal, but you can also mail your payment in cash to remain as private as possible. Mullvad has a no-logging policy and doesn&rsquo;t collect any identifying metadata from your usage.</p>

<p>Mullvad is also fast, ranking within our top five for speeds. Though oddly we did find that on Windows, Mullvad&rsquo;s OpenVPN configuration was actually faster than its Wireguard implementation. </p>

<p>Coming in behind Mullvad is IVPN. This Gibraltar-based VPN recently moved to dumping email-based identifiers and going with randomly assigned account numbers instead. Similar to Mullvad, it accepts a variety of payment options for privacy including cash, as well as the standard credit cards, PayPal, and other options like Bitcoin and Monero. IVPN doesn&rsquo;t rank as one of our fastest VPNs, but it does have acceptable speeds for most casual uses.</p>

<p>Another option is <strong><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398746/ovpn-2020-vpn-review.html">OVPN</a>.</strong> This VPN doesn&rsquo;t go to the levels that Mullvad and IVPN do, but it does only require a username and password to create an account. OVPN doesn&rsquo;t require an email address, though you can add one as a backstop for account recovery should you forget your password. OVPN doesn&rsquo;t rank in our top 10 for speeds, but it&rsquo;s just outside the top performers at number 12.</p>

<p>While our pick for best overall VPN, <a href="https://go.expressvpn.com/c/321564/1462856/16063?subId1=2-2-406870-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.expressvpn.com/vpn-software/vpn-windows" rel="nofollow">ExpressVPN</a>, boasts above-average speeds, Hotspot Shield is on another level. No other service comes close to hitting the speeds we&rsquo;ve seen with this service. This isn&rsquo;t just a one-off occurrence either; Hotspot Shield has consistently been at the top with speeds that are 12 to 15 percentage points above the competition. In our tests, Hotspot Shield maintained around 67 percent of the base speed. That&rsquo;s substantially faster than you&rsquo;ll see with most VPN services&mdash;though your experience may vary.</p>

<p>On the downside, Hotspot Shield doesn&rsquo;t allow for a way to pay anonymously and its privacy policy may not sit well with some.</p>

<p>Still, Hotspot Shield has excellent speeds, it&rsquo;s desktop application is very nice, and as a bonus it works with U.S. Netflix.</p>

<p>Private Internet Access (PIA) has been around for awhile and has demonstrated that it can continue to innovate and improve with each passing year. The latest version of PIA is no different. By updating their service to include unlimited simultaneous device connections it has improved upon a already solid VPN. But the real feature that stands out with PIA is its split-tunneling feature. While this is a common feature in most of the services on this list, PIA goes above and beyond. Not only does it allow users to pick and choose which apps they wish to run through the VPN, but it also allows them to designate IP addresses and DNS requests as well. It even comes with the option for an app-based kill switch, which will block traffic only on specific apps should the VPN connection break.</p>

<p>There are a few awkward interface issues and PIA isn&rsquo;t the fastest service we&rsquo;ve ever tested. But neither of these issues makes the service any less viable. Power users especially will love all of the tweaking that this app allows you to do with its extra features.</p>

<p>Torrents get a bad rap, and if we&rsquo;re honest, that&rsquo;s for good reason. Using torrents is the number one way to download pirated material including movies, TV shows, music, and games. But that&rsquo;s not all there is to torrenting. It&rsquo;s a very efficient way to download legitimate software such as Linux distributions and authorized content from sites such as <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://now.bt.co/&amp;xcust=2-2-406870-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">BitTorrent Now</a>.</p>

<p>Whatever your reasons, when it comes to torrenting, a VPN makes it easier&mdash;especially if the network you&rsquo;re on blocks torrenting. There are many VPNs among our top picks that could be used for downloading torrents, but our preferred choice is <a class="product-link" href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-100470607-14087873?sid=2-2-406870-1-245796-16451&amp;url=https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/buy-vpn/" rel="nofollow"></a><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393465/airvpn-review-2.html">AirVPN</a>. This no-frills VPN has a reasonable number of servers and country locations, really good speeds, excellent network transparency, and a focus on user protection. The price is also right at about $58 a year.</p>

<p>If you want variety and options in the server locations from your VPN, then there are none better than CyberGhost VPN. It offers a staggering 9,000+ servers for users to connect to, which is more than twice as many as ExpressVPN. Unlike some competitors, these servers aren&rsquo;t all concentrated in the U.S. or Europe, either. Their server spread totals 110 countries all across the world. The service even recommends optimized servers to users for various needs such as gaming, streaming, and torrenting. In our testing we found that some of the servers were faster than others, with servers located in Europe having excellent speeds and servers in Asia not fairing as well. But overall, the speeds are good enough to do most of what you want to do with a VPN&mdash;web browsing, streaming, etc. </p>

<p>CyberGhost also has a well-designed Windows app that is intuitive and easy to use, even when tweaking your settings. It lacks some of the power-user features that other VPNs on this list provide, but that shouldn&rsquo;t be a deal breaker for the average user. Ultimately, CyberGhost is a straightforward and easy-to-use VPN service with an incredible number of server locations. For those who travel a lot or just need access to a diverse and vast server spread, CyberGhost is definitely worth consideration.</p>

<p>Power users and those concerned with optimizing anonymity will love Surfshark VPN&rsquo;s unique multi-hop functionality. For those who might not be familiar with multi-hop, it allows you to route your traffic through more than one external server (i.e. connect to a server in Japan, but multi-hop through Singapore). This makes it more difficult to track your online activities and further obfuscates your actual location. </p>

<p>While many VPNs now offer multi-hop as a feature, Surfshark stands out by allowing users to either choose a predetermined route or create their own multi-hop route. Furthermore, Surfshark is working to implement its Nexus VPN network which will use a Dynamic Multi-Hop feature to automatically connect you to the fastest available entry and exit servers at any desired location. This should further optimize connection speeds across the board. So not only does Surfshark already have one of the best multi-hop features, but it is also set to improve by leaps and bounds in the near future.</p>

<p>If you want something that&rsquo;s all about ease of use then AVG Secure is a good choice. First, it comes from a known and trusted security company, so there are fewer worries about data security than with one of the independent services. The key thing with AVG Secure is that the interface is easy to understand and use. It has a big &ldquo;Change location&rdquo; button to help you select the country you&rsquo;d like to appear to be in. The app also tells you what your current IP address is and how long you&rsquo;ve been connected to the VPN. That&rsquo;s pretty much it. This VPN also works with streaming services and it has P2P servers. One thing it doesn&rsquo;t have is a lot of extra features, which is actually perfect for anyone looking for a no-frills VPN. </p>

<p>Choosing the best VPN for you can often come down to price. Windscribe Pro is one of the cheapest premium services around at about $5 per month (when billed annually). It is also really easy to use and offers great security, with both a Windows client and browser extension that work in tandem to keep your browsing private and pop-up free. Windscribe also allows you to pick and choose the features that you want via a build-a-plan system allowing for great versatility to meet each user&rsquo;s needs. Windscribe&rsquo;s free option is itself fine to use, and is a good test run before deciding on a paid tier.</p>

<p>If you want a VPN based in the good ol&rsquo; USA, we recommend WiTopia&rsquo;s PersonalVPN. The speeds are good, the price is right, and the app is very easy to use. It&rsquo;s true that a lot of VPN review sites stress the importance of having a VPN that&rsquo;s outside of the so-called <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes&amp;xcust=2-2-406870-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Five Eyes countries</a>, which includes the U.S.&mdash;some will even say to avoid the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes#Fourteen_Eyes&amp;xcust=2-2-406870-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Fourteen Eyes.</a> The idea being that if you use a U.S.-based VPN your activities may end up being secretly monitored by Western authorities. Snowden revealed such truths back in 2013. But if you&rsquo;re using a VPN to access your accounts for Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or any other U.S.-based service, then staying outside the Fourteen Eyes is more or less pointless. Sure, that VPN with an exotic locale may be able to easily ignore U.S. subpoenas for data, but the American online services you use are another story. Besides if an American VPN does you wrong, it&rsquo;ll be a lot easier to hold it to account than one based in Singapore, or even Sweden.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-a-vpn">What is a VPN?</h2>



<p>VPNs create a secure tunnel between your PC and the internet. You connect to a VPN server, which can be located in the United States or a foreign country&mdash;say, France or Japan. Your web traffic then goes through <em>that</em> server to make it appear as though you&rsquo;re browsing from that server&rsquo;s location, and not from your actual location.</p>



<p>When you&rsquo;re using a VPN, it&rsquo;s difficult for others to snoop on your web-browsing activity. Only you, the VPN service, and the website you&rsquo;re visiting will know what you&rsquo;re up to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A VPN can be a great response to a variety of concerns, such as online privacy, anonymity, greater security on public Wi-Fi, and, of course, spoofing locations.</p>



<p>While a VPN can aid privacy and anonymity, I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend fomenting the next great political revolution by relying solely on a VPN. To become an internet phantom (or as close as you can realistically get to one), it takes a lot more than a $5 monthly subscription to a VPN.</p>



<p>Beyond that, a VPN is an excellent choice for staying secure while using Wi-Fi at the airport or your local caf&eacute;. Hackers sitting on public Wi-Fi can try to hack your PC, but a VPN makes that task much harder.</p>



<p>Finally, you may want a VPN to spoof your location to download content you shouldn&rsquo;t have access to, but this too has limits. A VPN used to be the go-to solution to watch U.S. Netflix overseas. That changed in 2016 when <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3022813/streaming-services/netflix-to-crack-down-on-proxies-as-it-goes-global.html">Netflix opened up to almost every country on Earth</a>. Since then, the company has invested a lot in detecting and blocking VPN users. Even people using a VPN inside their own country will be blocked by Netflix if detected.</p>



<p>There are VPNs that can fool Netflix, but they are rare and there are no guarantees these services will outsmart Netflix forever.</p>



<p>Beyond Netflix, a VPN can help to download an Android app that is only available on a foreign version of Google Play, or stream content from regionally restricted services such as the UK-bound BBC iPlayer or Disney Plus.</p>



<p>One final note of caution: Do not rely on your VPN to protect banking information on an open Wi-Fi connection. Whenever possible, leave online financial dealings for home over a hard-wired connection.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-to-look-for-in-a-vpn">What to look for in a VPN</h2>



<p>Before anything else, understand that if you want to use a VPN you should be paying for it. Free VPNs typicall sell your browsing data in aggregated form to researchers and marketers, or give you a paltry amount of data transfer every month. Either way, a basic rule of thumb is that a free VPN will <em>not</em> protect your privacy in any meaningful way.</p>



<p>The next thing to consider is a VPN&rsquo;s logging policies. In other words, what kind of data is a service collecting about you and your VPN activity, and how long is that data saved?</p>



<p>Privacy is the basic principle of a VPN, and what good is it to avoid passive government surveillance only to have a VPN provider record all your website visits?</p>



<p>Ideally, a VPN will say it only keeps logs for the briefest of periods. Some providers, for example, only log activity in RAM during a session or automatically send all records to oblivion once they&rsquo;re created. Other providers may keep records for a few hours, days, weeks, or even months.</p>



<p>VPN policies also vary when it comes to personal information. Some VPNs want to know very little about you, preferring users sign on with a pseudonym and pay with Bitcoin. That&rsquo;s a little exotic for most people, which is why many services also accept PayPal.</p>



<p>Paying this way isn&rsquo;t ideal for privacy, but it means the VPN doesn&rsquo;t have your payment information on record&mdash;though it would be available from PayPal.</p>



<p>After the logging policies, you want to know how many servers the VPN offers and how many country connections it has. The number of servers provides an idea of how much load a VPN can take before slowing to a crawl due to overwhelming traffic.</p>



<p>The country connections, meanwhile, matter most to those who want to spoof their location; however, non-spoofers should also make sure there are connections in their home country. If you live in Los Angeles, for example, and want access to American content, then you&rsquo;ll need a VPN that provides U.S. connections. It won&rsquo;t work to try and watch Amazon Prime Video over a Dutch VPN connection, because as far as Amazon&rsquo;s concerned your computer would be in the Netherlands.</p>



<p>Some users will also want to research a VPN provider&rsquo;s peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing policies. There are VPNs that block torrents. Others turn a blind eye to them, but will sell you out in a heartbeat should you be up to no good. P2P is not our main focus here, but we will note in each review whether a particular provider allows file sharing or not.</p>



<p>Finally, how many devices does a VPN support from a single account? In this age of smartphones, tablets, laptops, and PCs, a VPN&rsquo;s cost should include licensing for at least five devices. Also, a provider should have Android and iOS apps to make it easy to connect a smartphone or tablet to the service.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>



<p>We judge VPNs on a variety of criteria including overall connection speeds, privacy protection, usability of the interface, country choices, server count, and cost.</p>



<p>Speed tests are kept as simple as possible. We connect to five different global locations for a given VPN&mdash;typically North America, Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia, and a wild card somewhere in Asia&ndash;on three different days at different times of the day running the test at each location multiple times.</p>



<p>Before the test begins we check the speed of our base Wi-Fi connection using an online speed test. Then we connect to the VPN&rsquo;s servers around the world and run the speed test again. We then show each result, average them out, and calculate the average as a percentage of the base speed.</p>



<p>Remember that internet speeds can vary wildly based on location, routers, PCs, time of day, connection type, the load on the VPN and speed test servers, and numerous other factors. In other words, our test results will likely differ from yours. For that reason, consider our speed results only as a rough guide for how each VPN performs.</p>



<p>Judging server choices by country is also kept simple. We expect a VPN to offer a variety of country connections with a minimum of at least 20.</p>



<p>Privacy and anonymity is judged on the guarantees the companies make, as well as its reputation from any news items we&rsquo;re aware of that may impact the trustworthiness of these claims. We also take a look at the data encryption, authentication, and handshake protocols used.</p>



<p>Finally, for pricing we expect to pay $60 per year, and anything over that needs to justify its cost with extra features or unique selling points of some kind. </p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Yes! It is perfectly legal in most countries, including the United States, to use a VPN. While using a VPN, you might find some websites that try to block your connection, but this is an individual website&rsquo;s use policy and has nothing to do with the legality of the VPN itself. One thing to note though, while it&rsquo;s legal to use a VPN, some of the activities done <em>while using</em> a VPN might be illegal. Such things as downloading pirated copyrighted content or accessing dark web markets are illegal whether you use a VPN or not.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>No, a VPN connection itself does not protect you from malware and computer viruses. It does however encrypt your internet traffic and keep prying eyes from accessing your browsing history.</p>



<p>Some VPN services, such as Nord VPN, do however provide additional security features such as ad and malware blockers. Additionally, many <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407277/best-antivirus-for-windows-pc.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">antivirus suites</a> now offer VPN services along with their security features. Although VPNs and antivirus software are used for different purposes, there is still a degree of overlap that makes using both tools together beneficial.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Most likely you will see a moderate speed decrease to your internet while using a VPN. This is mainly due to the process of your internet traffic being rerouted and encrypted through a VPN server before heading on to its destination. The amount of latency you will experience through this process is down to what country&rsquo;s server you choose to proxy your traffic through. If you choose a server located on the other side of the world, then you will notice a much greater hit than if you were to connect to a server nearby in your same country. </p>



<p>Thankfully, most modern VPNs should have the infrastructure to maintain high-speed, secure data transfer rates. So it&rsquo;s likely you can still browse and stream with no noticeable impact while using a reputable VPN like those listed above.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not as simple as just turning on your VPN and disappearing off grid. While VPNs certainly offer better privacy and security, they don&rsquo;t make you completely anonymous. There are a mindbogglingly number of ways that companies track you across the internet and a VPN isn&rsquo;t capable of blocking all of them. For example, when you sign into a website, your identity is revealed to that website. Or when you log into your Gmail account while using a VPN, Google can now collect cookies based on your browsing.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>There is no set number of servers that make one VPN better than another. However, most major VPN providers offer between 3,000 to 5,000 servers. Also, we recommend avoiding any paid services whose providers have under 1,000 servers as this may be an indication that the company is not yet well established, meaning that there is a higher chance for reliability issues.</p>



<p>It is common for VPN providers to advertise the number of servers they have, but this is largely a marketing gimmick and doesn&rsquo;t generally equate to the quality of the VPN provider itself. Things such as the spread of server locations and server quality are as important, if not more so, than the number of available servers.</p>

</div>


<p>Whilst the pandemic made working from home more mainstream, not everyone has the space nor privilege for a dedicated office with external monitor/s, a desktop PC unit and standalone keyboard and trackpad.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reality is that many people are still working from laptops on dining room tables, which isn&rsquo;t exactly good for posture (just think about those cricks in your neck!). This scenario has inspired Logitech&rsquo;s new product: The Casa Pop-Up Desk, now available in the UK, Australia, and New Zealand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This multifunctional product looks like an ordinary book when closed, but houses a few surprises that will transform your less-than-ideal work from home set-up into a more ergonomic experience&hellip;in theory. But how does it work in practice?&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="design-and-build">Design and build&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>



<ul>
<li>Three colour options</li>



<li>Houses a keyboard, trackpad and a compartment for cables/stationery </li>



<li>Weighs 1.2kg (2.6 pounds)</li>
</ul>



<p>Logitech products are nearly always high-quality, and the Casa Pop-Up Desk is no different.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When closed, the Casa looks like a large notebook. It&rsquo;s available in three color options: Classic Chic (deep grey and green), Bohemian Blush (pink) and Nordic Calm (off white) &ndash; I tested the latter. </p>



<p>That means the stretchy silicone strap keeping the &lsquo;book&rsquo; secure is lilac, but this will vary depending on the model you choose. The case features a fabric design that&rsquo;s wipeable, though mine did pick up a small stain that wasn&rsquo;t completely removed with a wet cloth.</p>



<p>When opened, the front cover expands out, then folds in on itself to create a stand &ndash; there are two protruding parts for your laptop to nestle into, and they are secure and sturdy. According to Logitech, the stand supports laptops from 10- to 17-inches, and can hold devices weighing up to 7.5kg (16.5 pounds).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Logitech Casa Pop-Up Desk - keyboard and trackpad" class="wp-image-2025328" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Logitech-Casa-Pop-Up-Desk-review-4.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Hannah Cowton / Foundry</p></div>



<p>The bottom of the Casa has three compartments, housing a keyboard (the Casa Keys), trackpad (the Casa Touch) and a section for the charging cable &ndash; but you could easily store pens or other small items in the latter. The keyboard is smaller than a standard one, but not so compact that you&rsquo;ll feel cramped when typing. </p>



<p>It features a&nbsp;range of handy shortcut buttons, including a dictation button, a screenshot button and even an emoji button for using in messaging apps. However, the keys aren&rsquo;t backlit, so you&rsquo;ll need a decent external light source while typing.</p>



<p>The Casa weighs 1.2kg (2.6 pounds), which is a similar to some slim <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techadvisor.com/article/723344/best-laptop.html&amp;xcust=2-1-2027731-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">laptops</a>. Whilst Logitech hasn&rsquo;t advised this as a travel product, one of the most natural use cases would be on a train or at a coffee shop. Sadly, the unwieldy build means that your bag will be hefty to carry around.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p> It looks sophisticated, it&rsquo;s easy to use and has an excellent battery life</p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="features-and-usability">Features and usability&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>



<ul>
<li>Connects via Bluetooth</li>



<li>Works with Windows, macOS and ChromeOS</li>



<li>Uses Logi Options+ app</li>
</ul>



<p>The Casa Keys and Casa Touch don&rsquo;t require a dongle, simply connecting via Bluetooth.&nbsp;The Touch can easily switch between up to three different devices. </p>



<p>While the Casa Pop-Up Desk is technically compatible with all laptops from 10-17 inches, Logitech specifically suggests Windows, macOS, ChromeOS, and iPadOS. The latter raises the prospect of using the iPad or another tablet, though it&rsquo;s not exactly designed for this use.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Logi Options+ screenshot" class="wp-image-2025387" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/logi-options-screenshot.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Hannah Cowton / Foundry</p></div>



<p>If you want extra customisation over your devices, then you&rsquo;ll need to download the free <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/software/logi-options-plus.html&amp;xcust=2-1-2027731-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Logi Options+ app</a> &ndash; it&rsquo;s only available on Windows (10 or later) and Mac (macOS 11 or later). Besides checking on the battery lives of your devices,&nbsp;you can also remap buttons, with a wide variety of commands to choose from. You can also alter the touch and tap controls on the trackpad and change the cursor speed. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The Casa Keys is quiet to use, and I noticed very little lag when typing on my laptop. I had minor issues with highlighting text in WordPress with the Casa Touch, but it worked just fine in all other applications, with the device responding to quick swipes and shortcuts. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="battery-life">Battery life</h2>



<p>When it comes to the battery life, you needn&rsquo;t worry. The keyboard can last up to five months on a single charge, whilst the trackpad can give up to three weeks of use. </p>



<p>These estimates are based on around a full working day (eight hours) worth of use. During my short stint of testing, I haven&rsquo;t made much of a dent in the battery lives of either gadget. &nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>When it comes to the battery life, you needn&rsquo;t worry</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Charging is via the USB-C ports on each device, and a cable is included in the box. Whilst I haven&rsquo;t time to run this device to flat, Logitech claims that a one-minute charge will give you a full day&rsquo;s use on the Keys, as will a 3-minute charge on the Touch. </p>

<p>There is nothing on the market&nbsp;that can directly compete with this product, but regardless, nearly &pound;180 is not exactly cheap. I&rsquo;d only consider the Casa if there is currently no space for a monitor in your home, and you&rsquo;re looking for an all-in-one solution that will help give you better posture. &nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="verdict">Verdict&nbsp;</h2>



<p>There is no denying that Logitech has created something entirely unique with the Casa Pop-Up Desk. It looks sophisticated, is easy to use and has excellent battery life. The pack away build and deceiving book design also make it a great decorative piece for around the home.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whilst it&rsquo;s mainly a solution for people working from laptops without a dedicated monitor or desk, a lighter build would also allow it to be a useful tool for working when travelling or out and about in public spaces. Plus, it doesn&rsquo;t come cheap. &nbsp;</p>

## AOC joins the $1000 27-inch OLED monitor club

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>There&rsquo;s a new OLED gaming monitor on the market. And if you&rsquo;ve been watching the space, you can probably sing along to this tune. Size? 27 inches. Resolution? 1440p. Refresh rate? 240Hz. Price? A thousand bucks. This one comes from AOC, which has been <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1528866/aoc-agon-pro-ag274qzm-monitor-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">making waves with its gaming displays</a> in the last few years. But it&rsquo;s hard to get too excited about yet another display that doesn&rsquo;t stand out in either features or value. </p>



<p>Let&rsquo;s get down to the hardware. The display on the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://aoc.com/us/gaming/products/monitors/ag276qzd&amp;xcust=2-1-2027434-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Agon Pro AG276QZD</a> is technically 26.5 inches, but makes up for it with that fast 240Hz refresh rate. That matches OLED gaming monitors from <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1387567/lgs-new-oled-gaming-monitor-is-the-cheapest-yet.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">LG</a>, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/search?q=asus+oled#gsc.tab=0&amp;gsc.q=asus%20oled&amp;gsc.page=1" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Asus</a>, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C3SFTL1X/?tag=amazondn01-20&amp;xcust=2-1-2027434-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Corsair</a>, and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/p/N82E16824011462&amp;xcust=2-1-2027434-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Acer</a>, all of which offer approximately the same size, 2560&times;1440 resolution, and $1000 price tag. To be fair, it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if some or all of these monitors are sourcing the same display panel from LG, so it makes sense that they&rsquo;d be so broadly similar in features and price. </p>

Connections include dual HDMI 2.0, dual DisplayPort 1.4, two USB 3.2 ports (no USB-C charging, apparently), and a headphone jack, plus a pair of 5-watt speakers that no one who can afford a four-figure monitor will ever use. The rear includes the usual RGB backlighting, and the asymmetrical stand base is designed with the odd contortions of eSports players in mind. AOC offers a three-year warranty for the screen, which covers OLED burn-in. </p>



<p>As nice as it is to see OLED tech finally arriving for PC gamers, I can&rsquo;t help but think the market is already getting pretty crowded at this $1000 price level. We&rsquo;re already seeing discounts on these premium displays (the Acer model is <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/p/N82E16824011462&amp;xcust=2-1-2027434-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">going for under $800 today</a>), so we may be reaching a limit on gamers willing to splurge for 27-inch screens at this price. The first company to offer a significant discount, or a much larger panel at the same price, is going to dominate. </p>

## Install Windows 11 without all the annoying bloatware with this trick

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Well this is interesting: A new bug lets you install Windows 11 without all the annoying bloatware.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.windowslatest.com/2023/08/06/you-can-install-windows-11-without-the-third-party-bloatware-in-two-clicks/&amp;xcust=2-3-2027453-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Windows Latest</a> reported this week, the inclusion of third-party applications such as the game &ldquo;Candy Crush&rdquo; or test versions of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407277/best-antivirus-for-windows-pc.html">antivirus software</a> can be prevented with just a few clicks when you&rsquo;re installing Windows 11. This trick wasn&rsquo;t intended by Microsoft, but caused by a bug.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="windows-11-bug-lets-you-skip-bloatware">Windows 11 bug lets you skip bloatware</h2>



<p>Several questions appear on the blue installation screen of Windows 11. Here, among other things, you can select the keyboard and input methods and the currency format. The region is also selected at this point. If you select either &ldquo;English (World)&rdquo; or &ldquo;English (Europe)&rdquo; as the region, Windows 11 will be installed free of bloatware.</p>

						</div>
									</div>
			</div>
		</div>

		


<p>That&rsquo;s because a Windows 11 bug comes into play that prevents the usual installation app routine. The Windows 11 installation program and Microsoft&rsquo;s internet-based Out Of Box Experience are not able to process the language code for World English (en-001) and European English (en-150), explains Windows Latest.</p>



<p>Due to the bug, the PC cannot communicate with the servers during the Windows 11 installation if one of these two regions is selected. Although an error message will be displayed during the installation process, you can simply ignore it by clicking on the &ldquo;Skip&rdquo; button. Adios bloatware!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="change-the-region-again-after-the-installation">Change the region again after the installation</h2>



<p>Remember to change your region to the correct one after installing Windows 11 though!. Otherwise, some services such as Microsoft&rsquo;s Store may not work. </p>



<p>Microsoft confirmed to Windows Latest that the company is familiar with the problem and is currently investigating it further. It is not known when the bug will be fixed. However, it is likely that the bug will be eliminated with one of the next Windows updates, so build and reset your PCs now while it&rsquo;s easy to keep Candy Crush from ever touching your system.</p>

<p>TunnelBear is a popular VPN service owned by McAfee security company and based in Toronto, Canada. It&rsquo;s been around for a while now and has always stood out due to its unique and kitschy bear-themed interface. The service has tried hard in recent years to add more features such as unlimited device connections in order to remain relevant in an increasingly competitive VPN market. Certainly there are ursine puns aplenty to be enjoyed here, but is the VPN service just right for you? I took it for a walk in the woods to find out.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">

</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-are-tunnelbears-features-and-services">What are TunnelBear&rsquo;s features and services?</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Tunnelbear vpn" class="wp-image-2021218" height="771" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Tunnelbear-homepage.png" width="996" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Sam Singleton</p></div>



<p>When you first open TunnelBear you can&rsquo;t help but notice how much work the designers have put in to it. The main interface is a world map geographically dotted with the available servers. As you scroll across the map, even the trees change based on the continent or region you&rsquo;re viewing (palm trees in the Middle East, Umbrella Thorns in Africa). Your actual location is signified on the map with a sheep, but once you connect to the VPN it turns into a bear.</p>



<p>Each server location has an empty tunnel icon on it. To connect, just select the server icon you want. In addition to selecting the server from a map, there is also a drop-down list at the top with all of the servers as well. Somehow in the TunnelBear universe sheeps turning into bears and bears digging through tunnels makes sense, but the logic is lost on us. Still, it&rsquo;s a fun and unique design element.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Tunnelbear vpn" class="wp-image-2021221" height="770" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Tunnelbear-Ghostbear.png" width="997" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>TunnelBear&rsquo;s settings including a VigilantBear kill switch and GhostBear features.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Sam Singleton</p></div>



<p>On the whole, TunnelBear is a simple service without a lot of frills, but it does provide some interesting key features worth checking out. Under <em>Settings &gt; Security, </em>TunnelBear has its own version of a kill switch feature called &ldquo;VigilantBear.&rdquo; It works a little differently than a normal kill switch in that instead of disconnecting your internet in the event of a VPN disconnection, it just blocks all incoming and outgoing traffic until the connection is re-established.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, TunnelBear offers a feature called &ldquo;GhostBear&rdquo; that makes your encrypted data less detectable. It does this by masking your VPN traffic and disguising it as HTTPS traffic, which is generally less likely to be blocked by censors. This can work well if you find that your connection is being blocked by streaming services such as Netflix. By turning on the GhostBear feature, there is a higher likelihood that your connection will be able to access these restrictive sites. Be warned, though, turning on GhostBear will likely slow down your connection even further.</p>



<p>Another feature to note is &ldquo;SplitBear&rdquo; or TunnelBear&rsquo;s version of split-tunneling, which allows you to control which apps or websites will have access to the VPN connection. Unfortunately, TunnelBear lacks many advanced features that competitors offer such as multi-hop and dedicated servers specific to certain activities&mdash;streaming, torrenting, etc. In fact, in the past, TunnelBear blocked access to P2P downloads but has since begun allowing them. Still, it is not something that it openly encourages with its service and for that reason other VPN providers such as <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/402413/protonvpn-vpn-review.html">ProtonVPN</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/395038/mullvad-vpn-review-2.html">Mullvad VPN</a> are better suited for torrenting.</p>



<p>TunnelBear offers desktop programs and mobile apps for a number of systems such as Mac, Windows, Android, and iOS, among others. There are also proxy browser extensions for Chrome and Opera. And just recently TunnelBear has switched to allow for unlimited simultaneous device connections with its premium plans.</p>



<p>TunnelBear does offer a free service that comes with the full desktop app but a 500MB-per-month data limit. It&rsquo;s a great way to test out the service to see if you like it, but the low data limit isn&rsquo;t likely to be enough to use it regularly&mdash;you won&rsquo;t even be able to stream an HD (1080p) video for more than 10 or so minutes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-is-tunnelbears-performance">How is TunnelBear&rsquo;s performance?</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Tunnelbear vpn" class="wp-image-2021220" height="567" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/protect-bear.2a0548b.png" width="598" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Tunnelbear</p></div>



<p>During my testing I rated speeds across TunnelBear&rsquo;s servers in five different countries all around the world and then compared them to our baseline internet speed. TunnelBear server speeds, honestly, weren&rsquo;t great. Across all locations tested, the speeds averaged a mere 33 percent of the base download speed and a rather poor 20 percent of the base upload speed. Not only do these numbers not impress, but it fell way short of the services in <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/616724/fastest-vpn.html">our top five fastest VPNs</a>.</p>



<p>Still, online speeds can vary wildly in pure Mbps tests from day to day and even hour to hour. It&rsquo;s best to take any and all speed tests with a grain of salt. Your experience with TunnelBear may differ from those in the tests for this review.</p>



<p>In regards to streaming, I did notice that TunnelBear wasn&rsquo;t able to consistently unblock sites such as Netflix and Amazon Prime. It was successful most of the time but the odd server seemed to have trouble or was actively being blocked.</p>



<p>When I turned on the GhostBear feature it seemed to solve most of these unblocking issues. Unfortunately, with GhostBear turned on, I noticed that my connection speeds plummeted and I wasn&rsquo;t able to stream HQ video because it was too slow. So GhostBear seems to work, but it wasn&rsquo;t really a viable solution.</p>



<p>Therefore, I personally wouldn&rsquo;t recommend TunnelBear as a reliable VPN for streaming. That doesn&rsquo;t mean it can&rsquo;t be used to stream, but I believe there are better options available such as <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398777/nordvpn-review-3.html">NordVPN</a>, which works flawlessly with Netflix, or <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394108/cyberghost-vpn-review-2.html">CyberGhost VPN</a>, which has a ton of locations to choose from and optimized servers for streaming.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-is-tunnelbears-security-and-privacy">How is TunnelBear&rsquo;s security and privacy?</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Tunnelbear vpn" class="wp-image-2021224" height="865" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Tunnelbear-protocols.png" width="1024" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>TunnelBear&rsquo;s protocol options for its Windows app.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Sam Singleton</p></div>



<p>TunnelBear comes with your industry-standard AES-256 encryption, which is the strongest currently available and it means you can rest assured your connection will be secure. The Windows app also supports WireGuard, IKEv2, and OpenVPN protocols. I prefer OpenVPN whenever possible as it&rsquo;s one of the most secure and flexible protocols available due to its open-source nature. But, if you&rsquo;re unsure, you can just select the <em>Auto</em> option in TunnelBear&rsquo;s settings and the app will choose what it believes is the best protocol for your connection.</p>



<p>Also, in order to confirm that my actual IP address is obfuscated correctly, I used a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.dnsleaktest.com/&amp;xcust=2-3-406999-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">DNS leak test</a>. It confirmed that there were no issues with accidental leaks of my IP address when connected to TunnelBear&rsquo;s servers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to its <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.tunnelbear.com/privacy-policy&amp;xcust=2-3-406999-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">privacy policy</a>, TunnelBear does not collect any DNS queries, IP addresses of users, timestamps, or other personal identifiable information. However, it does collect what it deems &ldquo;operational data&rdquo; such as user support and troubleshooting queries, total data used per month, and some sales data. It says that none of this information could identify users and are &ldquo;not related to the time and activity of VPN usage.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, upon sign-up, TunnelBear requires users to enter in their email address and payment information. Payment options include credit cards, PayPal, and Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Honestly, I was impressed with TunnelBear&rsquo;s comprehensive and forthright privacy policy. Not all VPN companies provide the same detailed or thorough information about what data it specifically collects. Also, TunnelBear continues to conduct regular third-party audits by Cure53, a trustworthy and reliable Big Four auditing firm. It has successfully passed every audit for the last five years. That&rsquo;s impressive and a big selling point for privacy-conscious users.</p>



<p>TunnelBear itself is located in Toronto, Canada, which means that all personal information is handled according to Canadian law. Canada does not currently have any mandatory data retention laws either.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Is TunnelBear worth it?</strong></h2>



<p>TunnelBear is a VPN that sticks to the basics. It&rsquo;s an enjoyable service chock-full of bear puns that are fun and lighthearted. It&rsquo;s also extremely easy to use&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t overwhelm with too many features or country options. And while this might be ideal for the average user, power users who like to tweak and optimize their VPN connections will feel that the service doesn&rsquo;t offer enough.</p>



<p>The speeds are passable, but not great&mdash;you might say they lumber a bit. Also, I did encounter some unfortunate issues with servers being unable to unblock streaming platforms&mdash;particularly Netflix. Overall, this approachable and cheerful service is a good option for users who are just getting started with VPNs or might not be the most tech-savvy. Otherwise, there are other services such as those in our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-apps-reviews-buying-advice.html">best VPNs</a> that might be better for more advanced users.</p>



<p><strong><em>Editor&rsquo;s note</em></strong><em>: Because online services are often iterative, gaining new features and performance improvements over time, this review is subject to change in order to accurately reflect the current state of the service.

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Getting serious work done on the go, especially for an extended trip, requires more than just a laptop. If I&rsquo;m heading to a conference, I also need a &ldquo;real&rdquo; mouse and keyboard, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1787210/best-portable-monitors.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">a USB monitor</a>, some kind of multi-charger, and something to give me a better viewing angle. Logitech&rsquo;s latest gadget (broadly speaking) tries to give you an all-in-one solution for extra laptop comfort. The Casa is a laptop stand, keyboard, and trackpad that folds into its own little folio-style case for grab and go ease. </p>



<p>According to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/products/combos/casa-pop-up-desk.920-011241.html#gallery&amp;xcust=2-3-2027305-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Logitech&rsquo;s UK store listing</a> (there&rsquo;s no US listing at the time of writing), the Casa Pop-Up Desk can make working on your laptop &ldquo;40% comfier&rdquo; with its fold-out stand that gives your laptop an elevated screen. The stand can handle laptops from 10 inches to 17 inches, weighing up to 16 pounds. The package includes a 60% keyboard and a trackpad (both reminiscent of the Apple Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad) with dedicated cubbies inside the folio case, which folds down into a package a little more than an inch thick and about the size of an A4 piece of paper. It&rsquo;s a bit hefty at 2.65 pounds&hellip;which might be more than your laptop itself. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>The keyboard and trackpad work with Windows, Mac, and Chromebooks, with the typical charging via USB-C lasting for months on the keyboard and three weeks for the trackpad. The fabric cover and matching accessories come in grey with a blue accent, pink-on-pink, and a nice black with a teal accent Logitech calls &ldquo;Classic Chic.&rdquo; </p>



<p>I really dig the all-on-one build and look of the Casa, but as a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1966306/best-mechanical-keyboards.html">mechanical keyboard snob</a> I think the board that comes in the package is barely an upgrade over a standard laptop (and might even be a downgrade from, say, a good ThinkPad). And I have to wonder why Logitech went with a trackpad when most users would prefer a mouse, even a thin one &mdash; again, it seems to be a lot of trouble and expense to just move the basic laptop interface down a few inches. If we&rsquo;re sticking with a basic laptop-style keyboard and trackpad, I&rsquo;d rather go with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1363856/this-cute-lil-monitor-attaches-to-the-top-of-your-laptops-screen.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">something like the NexPad monitor</a> that gets the same elevation trick. </p>

<p>And the NexPad is barely any more expensive than the Casa package, too. Logitech wants &pound;179.99 for the Casa in the UK, which is about $230 USD. You could get a portable laptop stand plus a basic Bluetooth keyboard and mouse for under a hundred bucks, even if it doesn&rsquo;t fold up into such an aesthetically pleasing package. </p>

The materials and design have shown major improvements over last year&rsquo;s model, too. </p>
</div>


<p>Mechanical keyboards are all over the place, especially in gaming circles. It&rsquo;s getting hard for a company to stand out, which is probably why some have turned to throwing every possible feature and gimmick at the wall to see what sticks. Corsair is taking a more focused approach with the K70 Max. It&rsquo;s the company&rsquo;s first keyboard with &ldquo;magnetic MGX&rdquo; switches, which allow for variable actuation points and dual assigned functions on every key press. </p>



<p>That alone would be worth a look, if not an automatic recommendation. But the K70 Max also piles on a bunch of gamer-friendly, high-end features, like a full 100% layout, PBT keycaps, a new dampened body, a super-comfy wrist rest, and smart media controls. And it does all this without being overpriced compared to the competition&hellip;though in this highly specific niche, there isn&rsquo;t that much competition to be had. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s the company&rsquo;s first keyboard with &ldquo;magnetic MGX&rdquo; switches, which allow for variable actuation points and dual assigned functions</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>All that combined earns this keyboard a recommendation, albeit a conditional one. If you&rsquo;re wowed at the idea of variable actuation for key switches and two functions on the same key press (and you&rsquo;re willing to pay for it), then the K70 Max is the keyboard to go for. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="corsair-k70-max-rgb-design">Corsair K70 Max RGB design</h2>



<p>The K70 Max RGB has a classic gamer keyboard look. It&rsquo;s full-sized, so prepare a pretty big chunk of your desktop for it, and a little more if you want the included wrist rest too. Extra media controls are above the number pad, <em>plus </em>a volume wheel and profile/lighting/Win lock buttons on an even higher strip, which it shares with Corsair&rsquo;s glossy strip of LED indicators for num lock, mute, et cetera. That volume wheel is metal, non-clicky, and does not have a recessed button. Also note the tasteful hexagon printing on this raised metal shelf, a nice touch. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Corsair K70 Max RGB wrist rest" class="wp-image-2024463" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DSC05280.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>The wrist rest deserves particular praise. I&rsquo;m of the mind that any keyboard in this price range needs to include one, and Corsair didn&rsquo;t skimp here. Its slightly rubbery triangle texture grips my palms while the cushy foam underneath is super plush, and the whole thing just sits at the perfect spot to make gaming or typing for hours on end comfortable. It&rsquo;s kept in place with magnets and a couple of foam pads, meaning it&rsquo;s both snug in place and easy to remove if you should want to. Just aces all around, and a notable improvement over last year&rsquo;s model. </p>



<p>The sides of the keyboard beneath the sandblasted aluminum deck are bare, while the top has a &ldquo;tournament mode&rdquo; toggle next to the removable USB-C cable. This switch will disable and lock any user customizations or macros (including lighting) and fix it in place with a little plastic bracket. I haven&rsquo;t been to any PC gaming tournaments lately, so I can&rsquo;t speak to whether that&rsquo;ll satisfy any sticklers for tournament rules. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Corsair K70 Max RGB volume wheel" class="wp-image-2024464" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DSC05340.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>There&rsquo;s a little more thoughtful design going on underneath the keyboard, too. In addition to sturdy dual-stage feet &mdash; a necessity for this three-pound chonker &mdash; there are angled grooves for rerouting the USB-C cable, also seen on the K70 Pro. Also, the way the switch LEDs shine through the translucent plastic on the bottom is super cool, even though you&rsquo;ll never see it while actually using this thing. It brings back fond memories of an Atomic Purple Game Boy Color. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Corsair K70 Max RGB bottom" class="wp-image-2024461" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DSC05431.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The RGB lighting shines through the translucent bottom. A nice touch. </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>Other notable physical features include nice, thick PBT keycaps (an absolute must-have at this price point), which are a little less &ldquo;rough&rdquo; than some similar examples; double-layer internal foam for sound dampening; and 8,000Hz polling for the superhuman esports types. The key layout and switch stems are standard, so this board should work with any custom keycaps, but the fancy switches don&rsquo;t allow for hot-swap sockets. Speaking of which&hellip;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-about-the-k70-max-rgbs-magnetic-switches">What about the K70 Max RGB&rsquo;s magnetic switches? </h2>



<p>Alright, it&rsquo;s time to get down and dirty with this board&rsquo;s defining feature: the &ldquo;Magnetic MGX&rdquo; switches. If you don&rsquo;t install Corsair&rsquo;s hefty iCue software, then you&rsquo;ll never know there&rsquo;s anything particularly remarkable about them. They&rsquo;re linear (that means no click or bump from top to bottom), with a typical 45g spring. They feel smooth and satisfying if a little more &ldquo;rattley&rdquo; than normal switches, because they lack a reinforced box-style stem. Oh, and Corsair has fixed <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/629830/corsair-k70-rgb-pro-review-ping-ping-ping-ping-ping.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">that annoying &ldquo;ping ping ping&rdquo; problem from the last version of the K70</a>. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Corsair K70 Max RGB switches" class="wp-image-2024460" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DSC05312.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>The magic in these switches is that the actuation point can be set magnetically, anywhere between .4mm and 3.6mm. In layman&rsquo;s terms: It lets you pick how light or hard you have to press the key in order for it to register. You can set it from a fairy light touch to a full, Beethoven&rsquo;s Fifth smash, in more than 30 increments. And this setting can be customized for every single switch on the board. So for example, if you want your WASD directional keys to respond to a feathery tap but you prefer a hard press on &ldquo;G&rdquo; for grenade, that&rsquo;s easy to accomplish. Perhaps more practically, you can set the Caps Lock or number row to only engage with a full 3.6mm press. </p>



<p>This might seem like a gimmick. And for a lot of users, it will be, especially if they&rsquo;re not interested in diving deep into software customization. But there&rsquo;s a lot you can do with this if you&rsquo;re the kind of gamer obsessed with perfecting every last aspect of your experience, particularly for esports. On top of customizing the force needed for each individual key, you can set some (or all) keys to double actions. A soft press activates one function, a hard press activates another, again, both of which can be set to custom actuation points. This is similar to some high-end game controllers, which can detect multiple levels of pressure on the buttons. So for example, you can press that &ldquo;G&rdquo; button lightly to throw a flash grenade or roughly to throw a frag grenade (assuming the game will let you bind those actions separately). </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Corsair K70 Max RGB from the side  " class="wp-image-2024459" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DSC05376.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>Make no mistake, this is a <em>deep </em>gamer rabbit hole to go down. In order to use this feature effectively you&rsquo;ll need to set up a custom profile for each game, and probably do a lot of very finicky testing to see which one works best for you. If you&rsquo;re not prepared to spend actual <em>hours </em>trying out different setups, the multiple actuation point function probably isn&rsquo;t that useful for you. Ditto for the &ldquo;Rapid Trigger&rdquo; function, which Corsair didn&rsquo;t have ready in time for this review. Rapid Trigger allows for an instant reset function as soon as the keyboard detects either downward or upward motion on the switch, ideal for crazy-fast strafing. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="corsairs-icue-software">Corsair&rsquo;s iCue software </h2>



<p>In order to set any of these functions, you&rsquo;ll need to dive into the iCue software, under the <em>Key Actuations</em> menu. For a standard single-key function, it&rsquo;s pretty straightforward, with a handy illustration of precisely where in the key press it&rsquo;ll be activating. You can also set up a custom reset point &mdash; this lets you release the activation immediately or with a slight delay as the spring pushes the stem back up when you release pressure. And you can set up the same custom activation and reset on a second function, typically the &ldquo;harder&rdquo; setting, for each key. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Corsair iCue software key actuations" class="wp-image-2024470" height="735" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/corsair-icue-software-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>iCue handles a staggering amount of information and settings, so it can be forgiven for being less than user-friendly. But I found that having to move between two different menus to set multiple actuation points, and the actual functions that they trigger, somewhat tiring. And that&rsquo;s on top of a solid 20 minutes of poking around to see how this process actually works. The software also has the usual tools for managing lighting effects with plugins available for Lenovo, Asus, MSI, and Nvidia hardware (there are even two different zones just for the Corsair logo on top&mdash;good grief) and various hardware toggles. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Corsair iCue software key assignments" class="wp-image-2024471" height="735" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/corsair-icue-software-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>Again, this probably won&rsquo;t deter anyone who&rsquo;s actually interested in the K70 Max for the variable actuation feature. They were going to spend a significant chunk of time customizing this board in any case. And if all you really want to do is play with a little custom lighting and set all your keys to the same light or hard actuation point, it&rsquo;s easy enough to do. So there&rsquo;s room for improvement, but those who get deep enough to find iCue frustrating probably knew what they were in for. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-does-the-k70-max-rgb-compare-in-value">How does the K70 Max RGB compare in value? </h2>



<p>Keyboards with user-selectable actuation points, sometimes going by an &ldquo;analog&rdquo; shorthand, are still extremely thin on the ground. SteelSeries makes one, the <a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=14154&amp;GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SVJJCP3/?ascsubtag=2-1-2024326-1-0-0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Apex Pro for $200</a> with a trendy OLED screen, and there&rsquo;s the somewhat niche <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://wooting.io/wooting-two-he&amp;xcust=2-1-2024326-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Wooting Two HE at $195</a>. Razer, to no one&rsquo;s surprise, has the most expensive offering at <a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=14154&amp;GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08QTXDBJ8/?ascsubtag=2-1-2024326-1-0-0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">$250 for the Huntsman V2 Analog</a> with some extra-fancy lighting. (Technically this uses optical switches rather than magnetic, but it offers the same custom actuation and dual actuation functions.) </p>



<p>Not having tested the other options in this segment, I&rsquo;ll have to fall back on pure specs. Corsair&rsquo;s $220 K70 Max has Razer beat in pure hardware capability, as its custom actuation settings start at just .4mm, versus a much deeper 1.5mm on those optical switches. I&rsquo;m prepared to knock the Wooting Two HE out of the value argument due to its complete lack of a wrist rest or any media controls. And I&rsquo;m inclined to give the K70 more props for its comfy wrist rest than the hard plastic on the SteelSeries. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Corsair K70 Max RGB lighting " class="wp-image-2024466" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DSC05402.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>The SteelSeries also cheaps out a little by having adjustable actuation <em>only </em>on its primary alphanumeric key section. Of course, having that kind of customization on the rest of the board is of questionable utility&hellip;as is the OLED screen on the Apex Pro. (See the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/search?q=asus+keyboard+review#gsc.tab=0&amp;gsc.q=asus%20keyboard%20review&amp;gsc.page=1" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Asus ROG Azoth</a> for another example of a keyboard with a screen no one asked for.) Call it a wash. If you&rsquo;re prepared to spend $200 on a keyboard with custom actuation keys, then I don&rsquo;t think a $5 discount will sway you, or a $50 premium will turn you off. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="should-you-buy-the-k70-max-rgb">Should you buy the K70 Max RGB? </h2>



<p>Once again I should stress: &ldquo;Analog&rdquo; keyboards are an incredibly niche product, and one that only the most demanding, tweak-happy gamers will be able to make use of in full. If you&rsquo;re a fan of Corsair&rsquo;s keyboard designs and features (and don&rsquo;t mind the body ping), the regular K70 Pro will serve you just fine at a $60 discount with a variety of Cherry switches to pick from. The only thing you&rsquo;re missing out on is that new padded wrist rest. </p>



<p>If you understand the appeal of the magnetic switches, and you want a keyboard that&rsquo;s filled to the brim with other features, the K70 Max will do nicely. Not only does it debut the custom actuation feature surprisingly well in Corsair&rsquo;s line (confusing iCue software notwithstanding), it also improves upon the previous K70 in small but meaningful ways, with a quieter body and a super-comfy wrist rest. </p>

<p>Go for it if you like the idea of customizing your switches without replacing them, or hitting two functions on the same key press. Keep in mind that if you prefer a smaller TKL or 65% design, Corsair will probably have those options available within a few months. </p>

<p>MacBooks and Windows laptops used to have more in common than they do today: An Intel processor was at the heart of both mobile systems. Since November 2020, Apple has equipped its laptops with its own system-on-a-chip&mdash;the M1, which was followed by the M2 about a year ago.</p>



<p>This made the differences that have always existed between MacBooks and Windows notebooks even more obvious. But each platform has certain advantages and disadvantages that can be decisive for a purchase decision. Here the most important reasons why you should prefer a Windows laptop, while our friends at Macworld have a companion list of the <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2020887/macbook-windows-pc-value-resale-support-design-ecosystem.html">reasons you might want a Mac</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="1-huge-range-of-software-for-windows-laptops">1) Huge range of software for Windows laptops</h2>



<p>You can really do everything with a Windows laptop: Because there is suitable software for every purpose&mdash;from productive programs for work, study, and school to creative applications in the multimedia field; from robust databases to smart mini tools with few functions. </p>



<p>Thanks to this large selection, you can choose among several alternatives within each software category. Take Office programs, for example: You can go for <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.office.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-2022447-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Microsoft 365</a>, but also try Libre Office, Open Office, Softmaker Office, and other programs with similar functions. (We&rsquo;ve got a roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/494496/best-microsoft-office-alternatives.html">best free Office suites</a> available.)</p>



<p>The same applies to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407277/best-antivirus-for-windows-pc.html">security tools</a> and actually every other software area. Last but not least, most programs that are central to MacBooks, such as <a href="https://adobe.prf.hn/click/camref:1011lroIY/pubref:2-1-2022447-1-0-0/destination:https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/campaign/pricing.html" rel="nofollow">Adobe software</a> for multimedia editing, are also available for Windows notebooks.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re not locked into one software source with a Windows notebook: Microsoft may like to direct you to its own store in Windows, but you can also download and install programs directly from software manufacturers that run smoothly on a Windows laptop. In addition, there is a huge range of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/443089/best-free-software-for-pc.html">free Windows programs</a> based on open source or as freeware.</p>



<p>Gamers in particular should definitely go for a Windows notebook: Those who have higher demands than browser games will get a wide selection of current games from the most diverse categories there.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="2-large-selection-of-different-models">2) Large selection of different models</h2>



<p>Apple&rsquo;s MacBooks cover the most important display sizes from 13 to 16 inches and performance classes: But there is always only one model series for one area of use. With Windows laptops, on the other hand, you can choose from a wide range of suppliers and notebooks&mdash;whether you&rsquo;re looking for an ultra-mobile lightweight for travelling or need a large screen and high performance for photo and video editing.</p>



<p>So find the device that perfectly suits your needs without having to compromise.</p>



<p>Because of this wide range, there are also Windows notebooks for which no MacBook alternative exists&mdash;because they are lighter, smaller or larger, for example: The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/538941/microsoft-surface-pro-8-review.html">Microsoft Surface Pro 8</a>, for example, weighs less than 2 pounds, and the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/825567/dell-xps-13-plus-9320-review.html">Dell XPS 13</a> and the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/559430/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-carbon-review-gen-9-goes-to-1610.html">Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon</a> each weigh less than 2.75 pounds. This means they undercut the MacBook Air in terms of weight.</p>



<p>Size is not a problem either: If you need a lush screen, go for a Windows notebook with a 17- or 18-inch display. Especially creative workers who work intensively with photos and videos will find optimal models with class-leading display technology, such as the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/560670/best-laptops-for-video-editing.html">MSI Titan GT77 HX 13V</a> with a Mini-LED screen, or the spacious 4K <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1955470/dell-xps-17-9730-review.html">Dell XPS 17</a>.</p>

<p>Apple undisputedly sets design trends with the MacBooks that other manufacturers follow, but Windows PCs can also go the extra mile in their designs. Take, for example, the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1386626/asus-zenbook-pro-14-duo-oled-review-perfecting-the-dual-display-laptop.html">Asus Zenbook Pro 14 Duo</a>, which combines two touchscreens in one case. Indeed, there are no Apple notebooks with even a single touch-enabled display, to say nothing of convertible and 2-in-1 form factors, such as the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1677692/lenovo-yoga-9i-review-2.html">Lenovo Yoga 9i</a>. If you want to operate an Apple mobile device with your finger, you have to reach for the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.apple.com/de/iphone/&amp;xcust=2-1-2022447-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iPhone </a>or <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.apple.com/de/ipad/&amp;xcust=2-1-2022447-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iPad. </a></p>



<p>With Windows laptops there is a large selection of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/617377/best-touchscreen-laptops.html">devices with touchscreens</a> that you can control flexibly with a tap of your finger on the display as well as via the touchpad and keyboard.</p>



<p>Most touchscreen laptops are convertibles: With them, the screen can be folded onto the keyboard via a 360-degree hinge, so that you hold a tablet in your hands, which you then operate as usual via the touchscreen. These devices also support pen input for writing, drawing, and painting: So you get the functions of a notebook and tablet in one device.</p>

<p>And, of course, Apple completely ignores one huge target group: gamers. They absolutely need a Windows laptop: Only here can you get a powerful GPU&mdash;usually from Nvidia&mdash;that can display current games in complete graphic splendor. Here, too, they benefit from a huge range of models with different features and in different price ranges. (See our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407493/best-gaming-laptops.html">best gaming laptops</a> to learn more.)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="3-windows-notebooks-are-cheaper">3) Windows notebooks are cheaper</h2>



<p>The large selection of Windows notebooks has another advantage: You are guaranteed to find a Windows laptop that is significantly cheaper than a MacBook or offers better features at a similar price.</p>



<p>The currently cheapest MacBook Air&mdash;as of August 2023&mdash;is currently available starting at $999 (and features the last-gen M1 CPU). But you can easily find a Windows notebook, such as the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1358891/acer-aspire-vero-14-review-from-trash-to-treasure.html">Acer Aspire Vero 14</a>, for $100 less that features more CPU cores, more memory, and a bigger SSD.</p>



<p>Even creative professionals who have to spend a lot of money for top performance can save at least a little with a Windows notebook. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="4-windows-notebooks-are-easier-to-upgrade-and-repair">4) Windows notebooks are easier to upgrade and repair</h2>



<p>Windows notebooks are not only cheaper to buy, but also in the long term: Most models are easy to upgrade and repair. For example, you can easily install a larger SSD if you run out of storage space, upgrade to additional, faster RAM if performance drops, or replace the Wi-Fi module if the wireless connection fails.</p>



<p>This allows you to use your Windows notebook longer and you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to buy a new device.</p>



<p>With almost all Windows notebooks, the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407542/best-ssds.html">SSD can be exchanged and replaced</a> with a larger one, as current laptops use the standardized M.2 slot for this purpose. Larger laptops in particular offer a second M.2 slot for an additional SSD. With many models it is just as easy to change the RAM by removing the SO-DIMM bars and inserting new ones.</p>



<p>Only in flat ultrabooks is the LPDDR RAM often soldered directly onto the board. The Wi-Fi module is also often replaceable because, like the SSD, it sits in an M.2 slot.</p>



<p>In current Macbooks, however, the RAM and SSD are soldered to the circuit board and cannot be exchanged and replaced by the user with larger and faster memory. Replacing the battery is also complicated. No wonder repair experts like ifixit.com criticize MacBooks for this.</p>



<p>Tuning enthusiasts also have an easier time with a Windows notebook: gaming notebooks in particular are equipped with additional tools and UEFI functions for overclocking, which can be used to get more performance out of them.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="5-with-a-windows-notebook-you-need-fewer-adapters-or-none-at-all">5) With a Windows notebook you need fewer adapters&mdash;or none at all</h2>



<p>Admittedly, this advantage of Windows laptops over MacBooks is narrow: Both now rely mainly on the flexible Type-C port with Thunderbolt to connect peripherals.</p>



<p>To connect multiple devices via one cable, such as USB storage and monitors, you definitely need a suitable docking station. Many flat ultrabooks, like the MacBook Air, have no ports other than an audio jack in addition to Type-C. On larger and more powerful notebooks, you will also find HDMI and a card reader&mdash;this applies to Windows models as well as the MacBook Pro.</p>



<p>However, most Windows notebooks still offer at least one USB type A socket: This is surprisingly helpful in everyday life because you can quickly connect a stick or an <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406861/best-external-drives.html">external hard drive</a> without having to look for an adapter.</p>



<p>Gaming notebooks also almost always have an Ethernet port with Gigabit or 2.5Gbit speed&mdash;the best option for a fast and stable network connection. Business users looking for a notebook with a built-in LTE or 5G module or companies that want to secure device access via smart card also need a Windows notebook.</p>

<p>Most everyone has laptops, smartphones, fitness trackers, tablets, or cameras lying around the house, no longer in use. If you don&rsquo;t need them, you can get cash for that old tech&mdash;it just takes a little time.</p>



<p>As you&rsquo;d expect, the more energy you put into the effort, the more cash you&rsquo;ll reap. Listing the item yourself on an online marketplace yields the highest returns, while using a buyback service lowers the payout in exchange for less work.</p>



<p>Here are your options, plus some tips for the best experience when selling your old gear.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="sell-your-old-tech-to-a-buyback-service">Sell your old tech to a buyback service</h2>



<p>The simplest method for selling devices is turning them over to a buyback service like <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=8053&amp;awinaffid=531979&amp;clickref=2-1-394408-1-0-0&amp;ued=https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=8053&amp;awinaffid=531979&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.decluttr.com%2Fpcworld" rel="nofollow">Decluttr</a>, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.gazelle.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-394408-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Gazelle&nbsp;</a>or <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.itsworthmore.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-394408-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">ItsWorthMore</a>. These websites let you input info about your older gear&mdash;make, model, condition&mdash;and then give you a valuation. If you like the amount offered, you print a free shipping label provided by the website, pack up the item, and then drop it off in the mail.</p>



<p>Please note, PCWorld just partnered with <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=8053&amp;awinaffid=531979&amp;clickref=2-1-394408-1-0-0&amp;ued=https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=8053&amp;awinaffid=531979&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.decluttr.com%2Fpcworld" rel="nofollow">Decluttr</a> to offer readers extra cash-back: During checkout, use the code <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=8053&amp;awinaffid=531979&amp;clickref=2-1-394408-1-0-0&amp;ued=https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=8053&amp;awinaffid=531979&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.decluttr.com%2Fpcworld" rel="nofollow">PCWORLD10</a> to receive an additional 10 percent on your trade-in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regardless of whether you choose Decluttr or another service, the company will inspect your item, verify that it matches your description of it in the initial valuation process, and then pay you. You&rsquo;ll receive the funds via PayPal, direct deposit, check, or gift card within several days on average. Sometimes, the buyback service will offer an updated valuation upon closer inspection&mdash;if you dislike the new amount, you have the option to request a revised evaluation or for your gadget to be sent back to you. Be aware that some services will automatically pay you if you don&rsquo;t respond to a revised offer within a certain number of days.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/04/decluttrcap-100885022-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="decluttr valuation estimate for 2015 12-in Macbook" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/04/decluttrcap-100885022-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">
<p>Quotes vary between buyback services, so try a couple places to see which offers the most money back. For this same Macbook, ItsWorthMore would give us $235.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p>Choosing a buyback service depends on the type of device you want to sell&mdash;each has a different&nbsp; focus. For example, Gazelle concentrates solely on phones and tablets, while Decluttr accepts an eclectic mix of items that includes smartphones, tablets, Apple products (including MacBooks for trade-in), Kindles, and video game consoles. For its part, ItsWorthMore focuses most heavily on laptops, smartphones, and some desktop computers.</p>



<p>Should you fail to find a buyback service interested in your specific older gear, you can instead try an alternative: trade-in programs at major retailers like <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fservices%2Fbest-buy-trade-in%2Fpcmcat133600050011.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat133600050011&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed" rel="nofollow">Best Buy</a> and <a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=14154&amp;GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/l/9187220011?ascsubtag=2-1-394408-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a>. You won&rsquo;t get as much as you would with a buyback program, though. When we looked into selling a 2015 Macbook, Best Buy offered $120 while Decluttr quoted $200.</p>



<p>Neither amount feels all that much, especially since we priced a base configuration in Good condition with a working charger. To get more money&mdash;or find someone who&rsquo;ll take less popular or flat-out old tech&mdash;you&rsquo;ll have to use an online marketplace instead.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="sell-your-old-tech-yourself">Sell your old tech yourself</h2>



<p>Online marketplaces come in several flavors&mdash;some are auction based, others fixed price. Some limit transactions to local, in-person exchanges while others focus on online sales. With so many choices, you can choose the type of interaction and level of seller fees that makes you most comfortable.</p>



<p>You also have free rein to list whatever you have on hand. While buyback services focus on a more limited number of device types and pay more for newer tech in good condition, online marketplaces generally allow you to connect with all kinds of buyers, including those looking for damaged items to refurbish or use for parts.</p>



<p>The major names in this space are&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.ebay.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-394408-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">eBay</a>, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.craigslist.org/&amp;xcust=2-1-394408-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Craigslist</a>, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.facebook.com/marketplace&amp;xcust=2-1-394408-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Facebook Marketplace</a>, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://swappa.com&amp;xcust=2-1-394408-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Swappa</a>, and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://offerup.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-394408-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">OfferUp</a>. Though their features and policies overlap, each has strengths and weaknesses that distinguish it from the competition.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/04/ebay-100885115-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="sample ebay listing 2015 12-in Macbook" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/04/ebay-100885115-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">
<p>One of the best known online marketplaces, eBay features a broad selection of listing formats and options.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, eBay supports a broad selection of listing formats, but its ultra buyer-friendly dispute process can sometimes become a hassle. And Craigslist&rsquo;s fee-free transactions mean pure profit but come with the risks of meeting up with prospective buyers in person. A couple of services (Facebook Marketplace and OfferUp) have either implicit or explicit verification of buyer identities, with the implication that someone who&rsquo;s public with their identity will be less likely to scam or steal from you.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How much money you get through an online marketplace can vary widely&mdash;each website has a distinctive take on fee structures. Local, in-person exchanges usually don&rsquo;t incur fees, but for any shipped devices, you&rsquo;re looking at losing as little as 2.9 percent of the sales price to nearly 15 percent. To maximize your earnings, study the fee structure of each company carefully and figure out the ballpark of what amount to expect.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, you will make more money on average compared to using a buyback service. When looking at recent eBay sold listings, that same 2015 Macbook that received offers of $120 (Best Buy trade-in) and $200 (Decluttr) went for an average of $350 to $375.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tips-for-selling-old-electronics">Tips for selling old electronics</h2>



<ul>
<li>Do a secure wipe of your tech before shipping them out. Most laptops, smartphones, tablets, and even smart home devices retain personal information about you. A normal delete won&rsquo;t properly purge that data.</li>



<li>Clean the item before taking photos. Removing grunge and buffing out light scuffs help increase perceived value.</li>



<li>Take pictures of your items in a bright area and from different angles. Get close-up shots of notable dings, scratches, and dents. Pay attention to the focus of your camera&mdash;a crisp, clear photo enhances the device&rsquo;s appeal.</li>



<li>Do some comparison pricing before you agree to an offer from a buyback service or create a listing on an online marketplace. For online marketplace pricing, we like to start with eBay&rsquo;s advanced search, which allows you to look at only sold listings. Examining those will tell you what formats work best (if you&rsquo;re deciding between auction versus fixed price) and what prices get people to bite.</li>



<li>Describe the item in honest detail. When in doubt, give more information than less, and document the item&rsquo;s condition with clear photos&mdash;doing so may save you should a dispute arise.</li>



<li>Is your device too old to sell? You can instead consider repurposing it&mdash;like say, converting an <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3572269/how-to-turn-a-laptop-into-a-chromebook.html">old laptop into a Chromebook</a>. Ancient or broken tech can be recycled through programs like the one available through <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fservices%2Frecycling%2Fpcmcat149900050025.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat149900050025&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed" rel="nofollow">Best Buy</a>) to complete your decluttering.</li>
