A rocket carrying the Luna-25 craft will mark Russia\u2019s first lunar mission since 1976. The expedition will attempt to land the exploration vehicle on the moon\u2019s south pole, hoping to dig up water ice beneath the surface. You can tune in to watch the launch here.</p><p>The Soyuz 2.1v rocket carrying the lander is scheduled to lift off from the Vostochny spaceport in eastern Russia at 7:10 pm Eastern time. If successful, it would be the first spacecraft to make a soft landing on the Moon\u2019s south pole. NASA confirmed in 2020 the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nasa-moon-sunlight-water-sofia-artemis-162600047.html\">discovery of water molecules</a> in sunlit parts of the Moon\u2019s surface. Salvageable water could mark a breakthrough for lunar exploration, providing future human lunar missions with life support, fuel (through extracted hydrogen) and even potential agriculture.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Russia\u2019s space trip also serves as a salvo in its attempt to reestablish itself as a significant world power unmoved by the West\u2019s sanctions over its 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The vessel\u2019s name is even a callback to the Soviet Space Program: Its last mission was the Luna-24, which spent 13 days heading to the Moon and back to collect samples in 1976. Referencing an era when the Soviet Union was an undeniable world superpower fits with President Vladimir Putin\u2019s goals to project an image of Russian preeminence.</p><p>Luna-25 is also in a race against India: the country\u2019s Chandrayaan-3 mission <a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/chandrayaan-3-india-set-launch-213939925.html\">launched on July 14th</a> and <a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/indias-chandrayaan-3-moon-rover-152132548.html\">entered the Moon\u2019s orbit</a> this week. India\u2019s craft is scheduled to reach the Moon\u2019s south pole on August 23rd. The Luna-25 will take five days to reach the Moon and is expected to spend five to seven days in orbit before touching down. That timeline has Russia\u2019s lander potentially reaching the Moon around the same time as India\u2019s, if not slightly ahead.</p><p>The craft is expected to conduct experiments \u2014 using its 68 lbs of research equipment \u2014 on the Moon for about a year. It includes a scoop that can capture samples up to a depth of 15 cm (six inches) in its hunt for frozen water.</p><p>You can watch the launch stream below starting at around 7:10 pm EDT.</p><div id=\"91464250d6fb469a8a924850d0fbe518\"></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/russia-heads-to-the-moon-for-the-first-time-in-47-years-203057705.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/russia-heads-to-the-moon-for-the-first-time-in-47-years-203057705.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-08-10T20:30:57+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The long-rumored 'Quake II' remaster is out now on PC and consoles", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/quake-ii-remaster-might-debut-at-quakecon-next-week-141123462.html\"><ins>The rumors were true:</ins></a> Bethesda has <a href=\"https://bethesda.net/en/article/6ucW3H8R8mYDWrn3ndqgYX/quake-ii-enhanced-release\"><ins>announced</ins></a> an upgraded version of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/quake-ii/\"><em><ins>Quake II.</ins></em></a> Best of all, you can play it today on PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch.

The accident, occurring on July 19, found a Tesla striking a tractor-trailer truck in Virginia, fatally wounding the driver of the automobile. These regulators believe that the 57-year-old Tesla driver was relying on the company\u2019s advanced driver assistance programs at the time of the accident, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-opens-new-investigation-into-fatal-tesla-crash-virginia-2023-08-10/\"><ins>according to a report by </ins><em><ins>Reuters.</ins></em></a></p><p>The Fauquier County Sheriff's Office provided more details on the accident, saying that the tractor trailer attempted to turn onto a highway from a truck stop when the Tesla struck the side and slid underneath the trailer.

The chat is viewed as a \u201clast rites\u201d meeting, giving the company one final chance to sway the government agency to back down before a filing decision. The anticipated lawsuit culminates a four-year investigation into the company\u2019s alleged anticompetitive practices.

The <em>WSJ</em> reported in 2020 that Amazon employees <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/us-lawmakers-ask-jeff-bezos-to-testify-154908160.html\">used internal data about third-party sellers</a> to create in-house products.

But one of the most common ways that people interact with Siri, Alexa and the Google Assistant is through a smart speaker, and there are now a wide variety of such devices available at a wide variety of price points. There are downsides to having a smart home device that\u2019s always listening for a wake word, as giving more personal information to Amazon, Apple and Google can be a questionable decision. That said, all these companies have made it easier to manage how your data is used \u2014 you can opt out of humans reviewing some of your voice queries, and it's also less complicated to manage and erase your history with various digital assistants, too.</p><p>The good news is that there's never been a better time to get a smart speaker, particularly if you're a music fan. For all their benefits, the original Amazon Echo and Google Home devices did not sound good. Sonos, on the other hand, made great sounding WiFi-connected speakers, but they lacked any voice-controlled smarts.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>That's all changed now. Sonos released its own voice assistant in 2022 and also supports Alexa on its latest speakers. Google and Amazon, meanwhile, made massive improvements in sound quality with recent speakers. Even lower-end models like the Echo Dot and Nest Mini sound much better than earlier iterations. With the growing popularity of these speakers, there are now more options than ever. Let\u2019s walk through our top picks for the best smart speakers at different price points and for different uses.</p><h2>Picking an assistant</h2><p>The first thing most people should do is decide what voice assistant they want to use. Google Assistant and Amazon's Alexa are both well-supported options that are continually evolving, with new features added at a steady clip. A few years ago, Alexa worked with more smart home devices, but at this point, basically any smart device worth buying works with both.</p><p>It's mostly a matter of personal preference. If you already use Google Assistant on your Android phone, it makes sense to stick with that. But while Alexa isn\u2019t quite as good at answering general knowledge questions, it syncs just fine with things like calendars from your Google account. And it works with perhaps the widest variety of smart home devices, as well.

It's focused purely on music control, so you won't use it to do things like send messages or ask the weather forecast. But as a music assistant, Sonos Voice Control is generally quite fast and reliable.</p><p>As for Apple, you won\u2019t be surprised to learn the HomePod and HomePod mini are the only Siri-compatible speakers on the market. Apple's Siri has a reputation for not being as smart as Alexa or Google Assistant, but it\u2019s totally capable of handling common voice queries like answering questions, controlling smart home devices, sending messages, making calls and streaming music. Technically, Siri and Apple\u2019s HomeKit technology doesn\u2019t work with as many smart home devices as the competition, but it\u2019s not hard to find compatible gear. And Apple has most definitely improved Siri\u2019s capabilities over the last couple years, with handy features like and Intercom tool and routines that take advantage of the built-in temperature sensor in the HomePod and HomePod Mini.</p><h2>Best smart speaker under $50: Amazon Echo Dot</h2><p></p><p>Most people's entry point into the smart speaker world will not be an expensive device.

One, they're cheap: Both the Nest Mini and Echo Dost cost $50. Two, they're capable. Despite the low price, these speakers can do virtually the same things as larger and more expensive devices.</p><p>The Google Nest Mini was released in late 2019, but Amazon just refreshed the Echo Dot last year. The Echo Dot is the best small smart speaker for most people. Amazon keeps improving the audio performance across its Echo device line, and the Echo Dot is no exception. It produces much louder and clearer audio than I\u2019d expect from a $50 speaker. The Nest Mini doesn\u2019t sound bad, and it\u2019s perfectly fine for listening in the bedroom while getting ready for the day, but the Echo Dot is a better all-purpose music listening device.</p><p>From a design perspective, Amazon broke the mold with the latest Echo Dot. Instead of a small puck like the Nest Mini, the new Dot is shaped like a little globe. It\u2019s much bigger than the Nest Mini, but that size gives it room for higher-end audio components. Although mostly hands free, the Dot keeps the physical volume buttons and mute switch on top, along with a button to activate Alexa's voice control. While the Dot doesn\u2019t look as sleek as the Nest Mini, having physical buttons makes it easier to adjust volume and mute the mic. I do wish the Dot had a way to physically pause music; on the Nest Mini, if you tap the middle of the device, the music stops.</p><p>Overall, the Dot is the best budget choice for most people, but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Nest Mini as another affordable smart speaker option. I generally prefer using Google Assistant over Alexa, and anyone who feels the same should go ahead and get the Nest Mini. The Dot does sound notably better, so if you plan to listen to audio on a regular basis, that\u2019s probably the way to go. But if you only plan to use it for a quick song or podcast when you\u2019re getting ready in the morning, just pick your favorite assistant and go from there.</p><h2>Best smart speaker under $100: Amazon Echo</h2><p></p><p>Amazon, Apple and Google all have $100 smart speakers: the fourth-generation <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDg1SEs0S0w2P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWQ2LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyMmUzZjBiNy1jMTc5LTM5MmEtODIxYy1lNmRmNTNjMjgwYTYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAATdcQZxdYwTZKlKR3f8wqWL47-eHL5SKRgMmwrEYltFC&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB085HK4KL6%3F\">Echo</a>, the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3719d8d4-5edd-4817-998a-91f3229e7323&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Walmart&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNzE5ZDhkNC01ZWRkLTQ4MTctOTk4YS05MWYzMjI5ZTczMjMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FsbWFydC5jb20vaXAvSG9tZVBvZC1taW5pLVNwYWNlLUdyYXkvODEwNzQ2OTYxIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyMmUzZjBiNy1jMTc5LTM5MmEtODIxYy1lNmRmNTNjMjgwYTYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAXA5tlqyG6X6C9ACOSTnyb27FaC-pkRyIPk1k08C52Vf&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FHomePod-mini-Space-Gray%2F810746961\">HomePod mini</a> and the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3719d8d4-5edd-4817-998a-91f3229e7323&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Walmart&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNzE5ZDhkNC01ZWRkLTQ4MTctOTk4YS05MWYzMjI5ZTczMjMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FsbWFydC5jb20vaXAvR29vZ2xlLU5lc3QtQXVkaW8tU21hcnQtU3BlYWtlci13aXRoLUdvb2dsZS1Bc3Npc3RhbnQtQ2hhbGsvNzc4OTkwMzM5IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyMmUzZjBiNy1jMTc5LTM5MmEtODIxYy1lNmRmNTNjMjgwYTYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfTf66g1NcLyueHahQ7Wo_B-ftmspS_GfKNyJWMUNylN&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Nest-Audio-Smart-Speaker-with-Google-Assistant-Chalk%2F778990339\">Nest Audio</a>, respectively. All three companies claim superior audio quality, so for lots of people these speakers will be the sweet spot between small speakers like the Echo Dot and Nest Mini and bigger, more expensive models like the Sonos Era 100.</p><p>Once again, Amazon punches above its weight. Like the Dot, the latest Echo is totally redesigned and the new internals were made with music in mind. It combines a three-inch woofer with two 0.8-inch tweeters \u2014 a more advanced setup than either the Nest Audio or HomePod mini. (The Google Nest Audio uses a three-inch woofer but only a single 0.75-inch tweeter, while the Apple HomePod mini makes do with a single \u201cfull range\u201d driver and two passive radiators.)</p><p>In practice, this means the Echo is noticeably louder than either the Nest Audio or HomePod mini and much better suited to play room-filling sound than the competition. It also delivers an impressive bass thump and powerful mid-range frequencies. In fact, my main complaint with the speaker is that highs aren\u2019t quite crisp enough. Compare the Echo to an Era 100 and the 100 sounds much more lively, while the Echo comes off a bit muddy. Then again, the 100 costs more than twice as much as the Echo.</p><p>While the Echo speaker may beat the Nest Audio and HomePod mini on volume and bass, Google and Apple\u2019s speakers are not bad options. The HomePod mini is the quietest of the three speakers, but it still sounds balanced across the entire audio spectrum. The bass isn\u2019t too assertive, but there\u2019s more presence than I would have expected given its tiny size (it\u2019s by far the smallest of these three speakers).</p><p>And it has a few nice perks if you\u2019re using an iPhone 11 or newer. Thanks to the U1 \u201cultra-wideband\u201d chip in recent iPhones, the HomePod mini can tell when there\u2019s a phone near it, which makes handing off music from your phone to the speaker (or vice versa) quite simple. Playback controls for the HomePod mini will automatically pop up as well, and your phone\u2019s lock screen will display music suggestions if the speaker isn\u2019t currently playing. Setup is also dead-simple \u2014 just bring an iPhone or iPad near the speaker and it\u2019ll automatically start the process.</p><p>Google\u2019s Nest Audio is also quite pleasant to listen to. It\u2019s a little louder than the HomePod mini, and has stronger bass, to boot. It doesn\u2019t have the same overall power and presence that the Echo does, but for $100 it\u2019s a well-balanced speaker that should serve most people\u2019s needs.</p><p>All three of these speakers support stereo pairing as well, if you want more volume or crave a more immersive experience. For $200, two Echoes will fill a large room with high-quality sound and enough bass to power a party. A pair of HomePod mini or Nest Audio speakers aren\u2019t quite as powerful, but it makes for a great upgrade if you\u2019re a more avid listener. A pair of Nest Audio or HomePod mini speakers sounded great on my desk during the workday. I don\u2019t need overwhelming volume but can appreciate the stereo separation. And two of those speakers together can easily power a larger living space, although the Echo is the better choice if volume is a priority.</p><p>Here too, I think that picking the smart assistant that works best in your house and with your other gadgets is probably the most important factor \u2014 but given Alexa\u2019s ubiquity and the new Echo\u2019s superior sound quality, it\u2019s the best smart speaker at this price point.</p><h2>Best midrange smart speaker: Sonos Era 100</h2><p></p><p>If you have more than a passing interest in music, the Echo Dot and Nest Mini aren't really going to cut it. Spending more money to upgrade to a speaker designed with audio quality in mind is one of the best decisions I've made. For years, I didn't have a proper home music solution, but in the end the modest investment has made my life much more pleasant.</p><p>For years, the Sonos One has been a favorite of mine, combining a reasonable price with good sound quality and a plethora of useful features like easy multi-room audio, stereo pairing and compatibility with tons of services. This year, Sonos replaced the One with the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1e71dc69-0ad7-47e7-abf5-dc3926557fa3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sonos&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIxZTcxZGM2OS0wYWQ3LTQ3ZTctYWJmNS1kYzM5MjY1NTdmYTMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc29ub3MuY29tL2VuLXVzL3Nob3AvZXJhLTEwMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjJlM2YwYjctYzE3OS0zOTJhLTgyMWMtZTZkZjUzYzI4MGE2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAZ2QTRvlnA5n8O6YgARV32cka-FgDMGabeYoGRrBpYQW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fera-100\">Era 100</a>, a $250 speaker that is an improvement in almost every way you can think of. Most importantly, it uses a new speaker array that includes two tweeters instead of just one as well as a woofer that\u2019s 25 percent bigger. The end result is that the Era 100 handily bests the One in sound quality, with impressive bass, surprisingly huge volume and increased high-end clarity thanks to the additional tweeter.</p><p>There are a lot of other improvements beyond just sound quality. The Era 100 uses its built-in microphones for much easier Trueplay tuning, which optimizes the speaker\u2019s output based on where you place it. Previously, you had to use an iPhone and walk around the room waving the phone to optimize your Sonos speaker, but now the process is much simpler. The Era 100 also includes line-in via a USB-C port and also has Bluetooth for when you just want to quickly connect a device to the speaker. It\u2019s a bummer that you need to buy an adapter to hook up a turntable or other audio equipment to the Era 100, but since the One didn\u2019t support line-in at all, I\u2019m still glad it\u2019s an option.</p><p>There are a handful of other small but solid improvements, like redesigned controls on the top that make it easier to skip tracks and a mic mute switch that cuts the power to the mic for extra security. Like the One, it's easy to set up Alexa or the Sonos voice assistant here, but the Era 100 <em>doesn\u2019t</em> support the Google Assistant \u2013 so if you were previously using a Sonos speaker and relied on Google, you\u2019re unfortunately out of luck here. Other than that one change, though, the Era 100 is an excellent all-around performer. It\u2019s a great speaker on its own and is also a great starting point if you want to build a multi-room audio setup.</p><p>The Amazon Echo Studio remains an excellent-sounding speaker as well, and at $199 it\u2019s a good bit cheaper than the Era 100 as well. If you want to save some cash or already have a bunch of other Echo devices in your smart home ecosystem, it makes sense as a speaker for higher-quality music playback. But given that it\u2019ll be four years old this fall, I think it makes sense to opt for a newer device that\u2019ll get longer support and updates.</p><h2>Best smart speaker for music lovers: Sonos Five</h2><p></p><p>As nice as the Era 100 and Echo Studio are, there's only so much you can get out of them. If you crave more bass, clarity and stereo separation, the $550 <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1e71dc69-0ad7-47e7-abf5-dc3926557fa3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sonos&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIxZTcxZGM2OS0wYWQ3LTQ3ZTctYWJmNS1kYzM5MjY1NTdmYTMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc29ub3MuY29tL2VuLXVzL3Nob3AvZml2ZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjJlM2YwYjctYzE3OS0zOTJhLTgyMWMtZTZkZjUzYzI4MGE2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAR25cLMb2vxNkMKEVe6NeoOcX395yZzkj30eSdpml_uG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Ffive\">Sonos Five</a> is the best sounding smart speaker on this list. It has many of the conveniences in the Era 100 and sounds significantly better than any other Sonos speaker. It also sounds much better than the Echo Studio and anything Google is currently selling.</p><p>That said, the Five stretches our definition of a smart speaker here because it doesn't have a built-in voice assistant. But it's so good at music playback that it's worth recommending you pick one up along with an Echo Dot or Nest Mini. Both of those speakers work with Sonos, so you can use voice commands to control the Five just as you would a dedicated Alexa or Google Assistant device. Sonos also refreshed the speaker two years ago with a new wireless radio as well as more memory and a faster processor. This means it should stay current and work with future Sonos software updates for years to come.</p><p>Since we're talking &quot;best&quot; here, I'm going to go ahead and recommend that true music junkies splash out on two Five speakers and pair them in stereo. Put simply, it's the most enjoyable experience I've had listening to music in years; I found myself picking up new details while listening to albums I've heard over and over again. It's a wonderful experience and worth saving for if you're a music lover. I didn't know what I was missing until I tried the Five.</p><p>The Sonos <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1e71dc69-0ad7-47e7-abf5-dc3926557fa3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sonos&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIxZTcxZGM2OS0wYWQ3LTQ3ZTctYWJmNS1kYzM5MjY1NTdmYTMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc29ub3MuY29tL2VuLXVzL3Nob3AvZXJhLTMwMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjJlM2YwYjctYzE3OS0zOTJhLTgyMWMtZTZkZjUzYzI4MGE2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAVjDDSsafMZzXOPRzL6yDO_3xbdyYsxSHlScfT0ot5w0&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fera-300\">Era 300</a>, also recently released, is a $450 speaker that supports Dolby Atmos spatial audio from Apple Music and Amazon Music Unlimited. I\u2019ve found that the quality of spatial audio mixes can be very hit or miss, but the good news is that the Era 300 sounds outstanding whether it\u2019s playing back Atmos content or just standard tracks. It\u2019s not quite as good as the Sonos Five, but it does have built-in microphones for voice assistants and easy Trueplay tuning as well as Bluetooth and the redesigned controls on the Era 100. Again, the main downside is that Google Assistant isn\u2019t supported here.</p><p>Finally, if you\u2019re an Apple Music user or have a lot of Apple hardware in your home, the second-generation <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MTMwZTJmMC1hMTRmLTRjNWUtYmRhYi1jZDUyYWM3ZDhlNzkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL2hvbWVwb2QvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyMmUzZjBiNy1jMTc5LTM5MmEtODIxYy1lNmRmNTNjMjgwYTYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZLnR3S2KbD5Q6PLJUnEcdOnwGDQLbiRbs0LzN41wTFq&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fhomepod%2F\">HomePod</a> is definitely worth considering. At $300, it\u2019s a lot cheaper than these Sonos speakers but supports spatial audio like the Era 300. The Era 300 and Sonos Five are better speakers overall (and certainly much louder), but there's a lot to like about the HomePod\u2019s audio quality at its price point. It\u2019s a clear, crisp vocal-forward speaker, and its design and software processing does a great job of making music sound like it\u2019s all around you, even if you\u2019re not playing back Dolby Atmos tracks.</p><h2>Best portable smart speaker: Sonos Roam</h2><p></p><p>While many people will be happy with a few speakers strategically placed throughout their home, you might want something that works outside as well as inside. Fortunately, you can find speakers that pair voice controls and strong music playback performance with portable, weatherproof form factors. For my money, it's hard to beat the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1e71dc69-0ad7-47e7-abf5-dc3926557fa3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sonos&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIxZTcxZGM2OS0wYWQ3LTQ3ZTctYWJmNS1kYzM5MjY1NTdmYTMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc29ub3MuY29tL2VuLXVzL3Nob3Avcm9hbSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjJlM2YwYjctYzE3OS0zOTJhLTgyMWMtZTZkZjUzYzI4MGE2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAeq2_H9R60wVGN9EP4TrWro8mlqbdOt9_4uJX6UE_CCp&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Froam\">Sonos Roam</a> for sheer versatility, not to mention audio quality.</p><p>When used inside the home, the Roam works like any other Sonos speaker. It fits in with an existing multi-room Sonos setup, or you can get a pair for stereo playback. Like most other Sonos speakers, it works with the Sonos Voice Assistant, Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa, and it supports essentially every major music service available. It sounds very good given its tiny size; it\u2019s quieter and not quite as clear as the Sonos One or the Era 100, but it still packs a surprising bass thump and distinct highs.</p><p>Since it was designed with on-the-go usage in mind, the Roam has a battery and Bluetooth so you can take it anywhere and use it far away from your WiFi network. And its diminutive size makes it easy to take it everywhere, both around the house and out and about. It\u2019s also the first Sonos speaker that is fully waterproof, as well as dust- and drop-resistant, so you shouldn\u2019t worry about taking it to the pool or beach.</p><p>The Roam gets about 10 hours of battery life, whether you're on WiFI or Bluetooth. There are other portable speakers that last longer, so if you\u2019re really going to push the battery you might be better served by another option.</p><p>Another wireless speaker option is the Sonos <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1e71dc69-0ad7-47e7-abf5-dc3926557fa3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sonos&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIxZTcxZGM2OS0wYWQ3LTQ3ZTctYWJmNS1kYzM5MjY1NTdmYTMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc29ub3MuY29tL2VuLXVzL3Nob3AvbW92ZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjJlM2YwYjctYzE3OS0zOTJhLTgyMWMtZTZkZjUzYzI4MGE2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAf9M3XjMC0rhmFH7biYEPUpkOqa2PQFYcaozlglnQTbi&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fmove\">Move</a>. It\u2019s much larger and louder than the Roam and has better sound quality, which it should given that it costs $400. But, rumors indicate Sonos is getting ready to replace it this fall with a new model. With that in mind, I\u2019d recommend most people interested in a speaker like this wait to see what Sonos has coming up \u2013 $400 is a lot of money to spend on hardware that\u2019s about to be replaced.</p><p>A better choice than the Move, unless you already have other Sonos products, is the $399 <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Cb3NlLVBvcnRhYmxlLUhvbWUtU3BlYWtlci1CdWlsdC9kcC9CMDdWRktCUTNLP3RoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZDYtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjIyZTNmMGI3LWMxNzktMzkyYS04MjFjLWU2ZGY1M2MyODBhNiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAcJ8lMPA4i0iXXFpC6cy2D1NxIuyoKaZL6BUuU7fBz7v&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBose-Portable-Home-Speaker-Built%2Fdp%2FB07VFKBQ3K%3Fth%3D1\">Bose Portable Smart speaker</a>.

That said, when it actually comes time to upgrade, that wealth of options can make it a bit more difficult to choose the right handset for you. If you\u2019re looking for a new phone and don\u2019t know where to start, we\u2019ve got you covered with a selection of the best Android phones for every budget.</p><h2>What to look for in a new Android phone</h2><h3>Performance</h3><p>When it comes to picking our favorite Android phones, the main things we look for are pretty straightforward: good performance (both compute and AI), a nice display, solid design, sharp cameras, long battery life and a significant commitment to ongoing software support. For performance, not only do we look at benchmarks and other metrics, but we also evaluate phones based on responsiveness. Regardless of whether you\u2019re reading, scrolling through social media or playing a game, no one wants a device that feels sluggish.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h3>Display</h3><figure><img alt=\"While the specs haven't changed much from last year, the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra's 6.8-inch 120Hz AMOLED display is still easily one of the best smartphone screens on the market. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/54f98de0-a87e-11ed-afd1-54c1e8d571fc\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>When it comes to displays, we generally prefer OLED panels that can produce rich, saturated colors with at least 600 nits of brightness, though many of our top mid-range and high-end phones can hit 1,000 nits or more. And more recently, most of our favorite devices also support screens with fast refresh rates of 90Hz or 120Hz, which adds an extra level of smoothness and fluidity.</p><h3>Design</h3><p>Now we will admit there is a bit of subjectivity when deciding which phones look the best, but there are other design aspects like dust and water resistance or screen durability that can make a big difference to long-term survival. It\u2019s also important to consider things like support for wireless charging, power sharing (aka reverse wireless charging) and UWB connectivity, which can have an impact on how your phone interacts with your other devices.</p><h3>Cameras</h3><p>Obviously, for photos we\u2019re looking for sharp, colorful shots in both bright and low-light conditions. And we want video clips with high dynamic range, rich audio and smooth image stabilization. Extra cameras for ultra-wide and telephoto lenses are a plus. It\u2019s also important to consider features like dedicated night modes, support for various video recording resolutions, and additional photo modes like timelapse, slow motion and more.</p><h3>Battery and software</h3><p>Finally, in terms of battery life, we\u2019re looking for all-day longevity on devices that also delivered great results on our local video rundown test (at least 16 hours on a charge, but more is obviously better). Wireless charging capabilities have become almost ubiquitous over the past few years, and most of our top picks have this extra perk. Finally, with people holding onto their phones longer than ever, we like to see companies commit to at least three years of software support, upgrades and regular security updates.</p><h2>The best Android Phones</h2><h2></h2><h2>Best Android phone overall: Google Pixel 7 Pro</h2><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Hb29nbGUtUGl4ZWwtUHJvLVNtYXJ0cGhvbmUtVGVsZXBob3RvL2RwL0IwQkNRV1lSMlo_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tbnotMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjhkZTg5YTJkLWIzNDQtNGQyMi1hZTg5LWIzMTRiNzVmY2IxZCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAZuzv_OntlWKtc3kU_R6DzOAL7wpXaS2FC4opPdWgj1c&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGoogle-Pixel-Pro-Smartphone-Telephoto%2Fdp%2FB0BCQWYR2Z\">Pixel 7 Pro</a> and the standard <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Hb29nbGUtUGl4ZWwtNy01Ry1BbmRyb2lkLVBob25lL2RwL0IwQkNRWFk1Mlo_dGg9MSZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1uei0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOGRlODlhMmQtYjM0NC00ZDIyLWFlODktYjMxNGI3NWZjYjFkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAASpA5F4f1KXYW4oQgh_yMRWREBd33uFTYbfquLiIWWVt&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGoogle-Pixel-7-5G-Android-Phone%2Fdp%2FB0BCQXY52Z%3Fth%3D1\">Pixel 7</a> might not be the absolute fastest phones on the market, but what they lack in pure performance they make up for with thoughtful software. Thanks to Google\u2019s Tensor G2 chip, the Pixel 7 series features powerful AI and machine learning capabilities that support things like on-device language recognition and real-time translation. You also get gorgeous OLED displays and the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-smartphones-140004900.html\">best overall camera quality of any smartphone</a> available today. And with the price tag of the standard Pixel 7 starting at just $600, Google\u2019s latest flagship is an incredible value too. The main differences between the two are that the Pixel 7 Pro has a larger 6.7-inch screen and features a third rear camera with a 5x optical zoom. But regardless of whether you prefer a smaller or larger device, you can\u2019t really go wrong with either the Pixel 7 or Pixel 7 Pro.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-7-and-pixel-7-pro-review-still-the-best-bargain-in-flagship-phones-170031940.html\"><strong>Read our full review of the Google Pixel 7 Pro </strong></a></p><h2>Best mid-range Android phone: OnePlus 11</h2><p></p><p>For those who want a phone with a big screen, excellent cameras and great performance, but for less than a traditional flagship, the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9PbmVQbHVzLVVubG9ja2VkLVNtYXJ0cGhvbmUtSGFzc2VsYmxhZC1Qcm9jZXNzb3IvZHAvQjBCTldRQzlGSi8_dGg9MSZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1uei0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOGRlODlhMmQtYjM0NC00ZDIyLWFlODktYjMxNGI3NWZjYjFkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAX-H-HDCbozJUO5Ri9Pm3mvkdJEw_ZVvcGSOfpg2-wVG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FOnePlus-Unlocked-Smartphone-Hasselblad-Processor%2Fdp%2FB0BNWQC9FJ%2F%3Fth%3D1\">OnePlus 11</a> strikes a good balance between budget phones and more premium devices.

Not only do you get a similar 6.7-inch 120Hz display, it also features a speedy Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip and a big 5,000 mAh battery. Meanwhile, thanks to OnePlus\u2019 blazing 100-watt wired charging, it juices up faster than any phone from Google or Samsung. And on the camera side, the company\u2019s ongoing partnership with Hasselblad has resulted in notable improvements in image quality.</p><p>The main shortcomings of the OP11 are that its IP64 rating for dust and water resistance falls short of what you get from competing devices, and the camera\u2019s 2x optical zoom lens feels a bit on the short side. But with OnePlus adding wider carrier compatibility and committing four years of OS upgrades and five years of security patches, the OP11 is a well-equipped option that costs significantly less than its rivals.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-11-review-price-release-date-cameras-150015371.html\"><strong>Read our full review of the OnePlus11 </strong></a></p><h2>Best budget Android phone: Google Pixel 7a</h2><p></p><p>The $500 <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b3JlLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vP3BsaT0xJmhsPWVuLVVTIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4ZGU4OWEyZC1iMzQ0LTRkMjItYWU4OS1iMzE0Yjc1ZmNiMWQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWBJdvYYzyh8qXtdVOgZLQuwiN_d6MKNMXdgavl3iu6b&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.google.com%2F%3Fpli%3D1%26hl%3Den-US\">Pixel 7a</a> delivers everything we look for in a great, affordable Android phone. New features include a faster Tensor G2 chip, a smoother 90Hz display and for the first time on one of Google\u2019s A-series phones: support for wireless charging. And with a refreshed design with IP67 water resistance, it looks and feels like the standard Pixel 7 but for $100 less. You also get great support thanks to five years of security updates and at least three years of software updates. The Pixel 7a's only shortcomings are rather small and include a lack of a dedicated zoom lens and no support for mmWave 5G (unless you purchase a slightly more expensive $550 model from Verizon).</p><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-7a-review-its-got-everything-you-need-and-more-for-just-499-184517525.html\"><strong>Read our full review of the Google Pixel 7a</strong></a></p><h2>Best premium Android phone: Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra</h2><p></p><p>With a starting price of $1,200, the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TQU1TVU5HLUZhY3RvcnktVW5sb2NrZWQtQW5kcm9pZC1TbWFydHBob25lL2RwL0IwQkxQMlBZNk4vP3RoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tbnotMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjhkZTg5YTJkLWIzNDQtNGQyMi1hZTg5LWIzMTRiNzVmY2IxZCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAVe1eNCu8XYyFXTbnswQHxk2ZNnTC1JBBPVTrU2LLOhQ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSAMSUNG-Factory-Unlocked-Android-Smartphone%2Fdp%2FB0BLP2PY6N%2F%3Fth%3D1\">Galaxy S23 Ultra</a> is very expensive, but it has excellent performance and practically everything you could ever want or need in a smartphone.

On the latest model, not only has Samsung added two new gestures for launching into side-by-side multitasking or switching from a full screen to a windowed app, it has also increased the number of recent apps you can see on the taskbar from two to four. The Z Fold 5\u2019s Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip also delivers faster performance than on the Pixel Fold, and even though it has a smaller power cell (4,400 mAh vs 4,800 mAh), it has better battery life, too. But the biggest change for this generation is Samsung\u2019s new Flex Hinge, which allows the phone to close completely flat and makes it thinner to boot. Unfortunately, its cameras are largely unchanged from last year, and with prices starting at $1,800, the Z Fold 5 isn\u2019t even remotely close to being affordable.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/galaxy-z-fold-5-review-five-years-in-samsung-is-treading-water-140002461.html\"><strong>Read our full review of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5</strong></a></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-android-phone-130030805.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-android-phone-130030805.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-08-10T14:10:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Nine thoughts about Star Trek: Strange New Worlds\u2019 blockbuster finale", "description": "<p><em>The following article discusses spoilers for \u201cHegemony\u201d and Star Trek more generally.</em></p><p><strong>1.</strong> Bloody hell. I\u2019ve repeatedly said that <em>Strange New Worlds</em> exudes a special sort of confidence this season. The cast and crew are working as a seamless whole, knowing that the conviction at which you sell is just as important as the quality of what\u2019s being sold. The team has raised their floor and ceiling in equal measure, and even the worst episode was bad because of what it said, not because of how it said it. \u201cHegemony,\u201d is a finale that, aided by the early commission of season three, acts as one part victory lap and one part set up for what follows.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p><strong>2.</strong> The powers that be at Paramount didn\u2019t signal ahead of time that this episode would end on a cliffhanger. In fact, Henry Alonso Myers\u2019 screenplay is a brilliant feint, suggesting the episode will wrap up on a satisfactory, if brisk, ending before the rug pull in its final moment. You\u2019d be forgiven for not noticing the different transporter energy when the survivors were beamed away on your first watch. Myers\u2019 script and Maja Vrvilo\u2019s direction is permeated with a low-level feeling of dread that suits the needs of both the <em>Alien</em>-esque horror and the raised-stakes of a finale.</p><p><strong>3.</strong><em>Strange New Worlds</em> has been smarter about setting up and paying off its threads than you might expect. \u201cAmong the Lotus Eaters\u201d saw Ortegas feeling sidelined after getting bumped from an away team which forced her to accept her role as the ship\u2019s pilot. Here, she finally gets her wish to go on a mission, but her initial enthusiasm is sapped when she realizes she\u2019s more or less out of her depth. Her scene with Dr. M'Benga, where she admits she\u2019s leaving the role of action hero to the captain, underscores this. The fact she\u2019s one of the crewmembers taken by the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/strange-new-worlds-109-review-130012075.html\">Gorn</a> at the end adds a darker weight to her finally getting her wish granted.</p><figure><img alt=\"Celia Rose Gooding as Uhura in Star Trek: Strange New Worlds streaming on Paramount+, 2023.

I guess it was just too tempting not to follow up on that this time, with Martin Quinn as the young engineer. It\u2019s gratifying to see an actual, Paisley-born Scot playing the role, and an amusing fact that he\u2019s the second actor  \u2013 after Simon Pegg \u2013 who has paid their dues playing roles in various British comedy shows. If Quinn hangs around, I can\u2019t wait for Trek completionists to watch <em>Limmy\u2019s Show</em> and <em>Derry Girls</em> to watch his early work, much like when I watched Brent Spiner on <em>Cheers</em> and <em>Night Court.</em></p><p><strong>5.</strong> I don\u2019t want to harp on <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-finds-the-limit-of-what-a-prequel-can-say-130027427.html\">about the limitations a prequel imposes</a>, because we all know the score now. It may bend the edges of Trek\u2019s established narrative but <em>Strange New Worlds</em> can never escape its eventual destination. Young Kirk, Young Spock, Young Uhura, Young Chapel, Young Scotty and Young Dr. M\u2019Benga will all be here, around and alive, to turn into their 1966 counterparts. You can\u2019t put any of those characters in jeopardy, or base your episode around asking that question, because we already know who is safe.</p><p>That\u2019s why the emotional beats of Spock\u2019s dramatic rescue of Chapel worked perfectly, but asking the question of her survival did not. The show was smart enough to only leave the issue lingering for the first act before we saw Chapel working to stay alive. (Notice she also gets to do an EVA in a proper spacesuit after her emergency leap in \u201c<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-picks-up-where-it-left-off-130025200.html\">The Broken Circle</a>.\u201d) But I can only speak as a \u201cfan\u201d so maybe it worked better for those mainstream viewers who have made <em>Strange New Worlds</em> one of the biggest shows on streaming TV.</p><figure><img alt=\"L-R Ethan Peck as Spock and Anson Mount as Capt.

Two-fisted thinking men of action as comfortable on the back of a horse as they were quoting poetry or discussing naval history. This lack of distinction wasn\u2019t really an issue back then, or even now, until <em>Strange New Worlds</em> made the conscious decision to let Kirk lurk on the periphery of Pike\u2019s narrative.</p><p>It meant the production team needed to retrofit Pike as different from his successor, helped by Anson Mount\u2019s gravitas and easy charm. And the first season finale made it clear that Pike\u2019s reluctance to shoot first and ask questions later was his tragic flaw. One that Kirk didn\u2019t have, which made him a better leader to take the Enterprise on its next set of missions. But Anson Mount\u2019s paternity leave and reduced shooting schedule meant there wasn\u2019t time to examine the fallout from \u201c<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-110-a-quality-of-mercy-review-130037849.html\">A Quality of Mercy</a>\u201d in any detail.</p><p>After all, he now knows his desire to find a peaceful solution single-handedly started a war that wiped out the Federation. He also knows he has to remain true to his principles or else he could pollute the timeline and not be in the right place to save future Spock\u2019s life. The fact he\u2019s unable to make a decision in the cliffhanger is entirely congruent with the journey Pike has been on, but it\u2019s clear the steps leading to this moment would have been explored far more had Mount been available.</p><p>\u201cHegemony,\u201d then, is the show\u2019s first real chance to look at how Pike has tried to grow into Kirk\u2019s mold, despite how ill-fitting he finds it. In his first talk with Admiral April, he advocates a policy of shooting first, but not long after he\u2019s thinking about trying to find a peaceful solution. It\u2019s those two competing urges that paralyze Pike in the finale, knowing there are lives on the line whatever he does. But, again, you have to praise the production team for trusting the audience will keep up with what happened in the previous season.</p><p><strong>7.</strong> It\u2019s not great that <em>Strange New Worlds</em> can only do so much to put clear water between Pike and Kirk. You can\u2019t make Pike look too old-fashioned or useless without alienating him from the audience, especially given his forthcoming ultimate sacrifice. But go too far the other way and you make Pike a dove in comparison with the more hawkish Kirk which, to me, feels like the wrong message to be sending.</p><figure><img alt=\"L-R Ethan Peck as Spock and Rebecca Romijn as Una in Star Trek: Strange New Worlds streaming on Paramount+, 2023.

You could easily argue it never needs to end so much as just swap out characters until you\u2019ve rebuilt the 1966 ensemble. Every generation of Paramount executives harbors a desire to get a do-over on Kirk and Spock in the hope their name recognition alone will carry a series.</p><p>But I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s something people would actually want? I\u2019m not sure I do, but then my dream would be an original series set in Trek\u2019s present with no legacy characters at all. And I know that\u2019s something of a minority opinion compared to all those folks who want yet another run on the nostalgia treadmill set in the safety of Trek\u2019s past. (If nothing else, at least <em>Strange New Worlds</em> has kept its fan service to a minimum and tried, as best as it can, to set out on its own path.)</p><p><strong>9.</strong>  At the end of my <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-110-a-quality-of-mercy-review-130037849.html\">season one finale review</a>, I wrote  \u201cWhisper it, friends, but <em>Strange New Worlds</em> might actually be good?\u201d That was a fair line at the time, since the show <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-preview-040051197.html\">took a while</a> before clicking into a high gear. Since then, however, more or less every episode has improved upon the last to produce a second season with barely any weak notes. We don\u2019t need to whisper anything now, <em>Strange New Worlds</em> is the best live-action Trek of the streaming era.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/nine-thoughts-about-star-trek-strange-new-worlds-blockbuster-finale-130046409.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/nine-thoughts-about-star-trek-strange-new-worlds-blockbuster-finale-130046409.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-08-10T13:00:46+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The best gaming laptops for 2023", "description": "<p>For a few years now, gaming laptops have been some of the most intriguing PCs around. They\u2019ve gotten thinner and lighter, naturally \u2014 but they\u2019ve also become vastly more powerful and efficient, making them suitable for both work and play. They\u2019ve adopted some bold innovations, like rotating hinges and near desktop-like customizability.

We'll help you figure out which is the best gaming laptop for you, from budget options like the Dell G15 to premium notebooks like the Razer Blade 15 and everything in between.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img alt=\"ASUS ROG G14\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/1c6ceae0-e935-11ea-9d63-fcfd47b39fd9\" /><figcaption>Devindra Hardawar/Engadget </figcaption></figure><h2><br />What's your budget?&nbsp;</h2><p>Your laptop buying journey starts and ends with the amount of money you're willing to spend. No surprise there. The good news: There are plenty of options for gamers of every budget. In particular, we're seeing some great entry-level PC gaming choices under $1,000, like Dell's G15 lineup. A cheap gaming laptop in this price range will definitely feel a bit flimsier than pricier models, and they'll likely skimp on RAM, storage and overall power. But most cheaper laptops should be able to handle the majority of video games running at 1080p at 60 frames per second, which is the bare minimum you'd want from any system.</p><p>Things get interesting when you start looking at the best gaming laptops in the mid-range space, with prices at $1,000 and higher. At that point, you'll start finding PCs like the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/asus-zephyrus-g14-review-amd-ryzen-radeon-173016459.html\">ASUS Zephyrus ROG G14</a>, one of our favorite gaming notebooks. In general, you can look forward to far better build quality than budget laptops (metal cases!), improved graphics power and enough RAM and storage space to handle the most demanding games. These are the gaming machines we'd recommend for most people, as they'll keep you gaming and working for years before you need to worry about an upgrade.</p><p>If you're willing to spend around $1,800 or more, you can start considering more premium options like Razer's Blade. Expect impeccably polished cases, the fastest hardware on the market, and ridiculously thin designs. The sky's the limit here: Alienware's uber customizable Area 51m is an enormous beast that can cost up to $4,700. Few people need a machine that high-end, but if you're a gamer with extra cash to burn, it may be worth taking a close look at some of these pricier systems.</p><figure><img alt=\"Origin Evo16\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/a3e1f580-e933-11ea-bf65-73681726b0ba\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h2><br />What kind of CPU and GPU do you want?</h2><p>The answer to this question used to be relatively simple: Just get an Intel chip with an NVIDIA GPU. But over the last few years AMD has stepped up its game with its Ryzen notebook processors, which are better suited for juggling multiple tasks at once (like streaming to Twitch while blasting fools in Fortnite). Intel responded with its impressive 12th and 13th-gen chips, but it\u2019s nice to have decent Ryzen AMD alternatives available, especially since they\u2019re often cheaper than comparable Intel models.</p><p>When it comes to video cards, though, AMD is still catching up. Its Radeon RX 6000M GPU has been a fantastic performer in notebooks like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-strix-g15-advantage-review-amd-radeon-rx-6000m-120031416.html\">ASUS\u2019s ROG Strix G15</a>, but it lags behind NVIDIA when it comes to newer features like ray tracing. (We\u2019re still waiting to test AMD\u2019s new Radeon 7000 series mobile graphics.) At the very least, a Radeon-powered notebook can approach the general gaming performance of the NVIDIA RTX 3070 and 3080 GPUs.</p><p>If you want to future-proof your purchase, or you\u2019re just eager to see how much better ray tracing can make your games look, you\u2019re probably better off with an NVIDIA video card. They\u2019re in far more systems, and it\u2019s clear that they have better optimized ray tracing technology. NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPUs also feature the company\u2019s DLSS technology, which uses AI to upscale games to higher resolutions. That\u2019ll let you play a game like <em>Destiny 2</em> in 4K with faster frame rates. That\u2019s useful if you\u2019re trying to take advantage of a high refresh rate monitor.</p><p>You\u2019ll still find plenty of laptops with NVIDIA\u2019s older RTX 30-series GPUs these days, and they\u2019ll still give you tremendous performance. But to be safe, it\u2019s probably worth opting for the newer RTX 40-series systems, since they support the newer DLSS 3 technology and offer a wealth of performance upgrades. (If you\u2019re looking out for the best deals, you can probably find some killer RTX 3070 laptops out there.) The entry-level RTX 4050 is a solid start, but we\u2019d suggest going for a 4060 or 4070 if you\u2019re aiming to maximize your framerates on faster screens. The RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 are both incredibly powerful, but they typically make systems far too expensive for most users.</p><p>It\u2019s worth noting that NVIDIA\u2019s mobile GPUs aren\u2019t directly comparable to its more powerful desktop hardware. PC makers can also tweak voltages to make gaming performance better in a thinner case. Basically, don\u2019t be surprised if you see notebooks that perform very differently, even if they\u2019re all equipped with the same GPU.</p><figure><img alt=\"Razer Blade 15\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/22960650-e934-11ea-92de-9913d49e86b1\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h2><br />What kind of screen do you want?</h2><p>Screen size is a good place to start when judging gaming notebooks. In general, 15-inch laptops will be the best balance of immersion and portability, while larger 17-inch models are heftier, but naturally give you more screen real estate. There are some 13-inch gaming notebooks, like the Razer Blade Stealth, but paradoxically you'll often end up paying more for those than slightly larger 15-inch options. We\u2019re also seeing plenty of 14-inch options, like the Zephyrus G14 and Blade 14, which are generally beefier than 13-inch laptops while still being relatively portable.</p><p>But these days, there is plenty to consider beyond screen size. For one: refresh rates. Most monitors refresh their screens vertically 60 times per second, or at 60Hz. That's a standard in use since black and white NTSC TVs. But over the past few years, displays have evolved considerably. Now, 120Hz 1080p screens are the bare minimum you'd want in any gaming notebook \u2014 and there are faster 144Hz, 240Hz and even 360Hz panels. All of this is in the service of one thing: making everything on your display look as smooth as possible.</p><p>For games, higher refresh rates also help eliminate screen tearing and other artifacts that could get in the way of your frag fest. And for everything else, it just leads to a better viewing experience. Even scrolling a web page on a 120Hz or faster monitor is starkly different from a 60Hz screen. Instead of seeing a jittery wall of text and pictures, everything moves seamlessly, as if you're unwinding a glossy paper magazine. Going beyond 120Hz makes gameplay look even more responsive, which to some players gives them a slight advantage.</p><figure><img alt=\"Gigabyte Aero 15\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/821d1030-e936-11ea-9d7f-aed162772f3d\" /><figcaption>Steve Dent/Engadget </figcaption></figure><p>Not to make things more complicated, but you should also keep an eye out for NVIDIA's G-SYNC and AMD's FreeSync. They're both adaptive sync technologies that can match your screen's refresh rate with the framerate of your game. That also helps to reduce screen tearing and make gameplay smoother. Consider them nice bonuses on top of a high refresh rate monitor; they're not necessary, but they can still offer a slight visual improvement.</p><p><strong>See Also:</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-laptops-120008636.html\"><strong>Best Laptops for 2023</strong></a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-affordable-windows-laptops-123000512.html\"><strong>Best Cheap Windows Laptops</strong></a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-2-in-1-laptops-173038508.html\"><strong>Best 2-in-1 Laptops for 2023</strong></a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-chromebooks-160054646.html\"><strong>Best Chromebooks</strong></a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-laptops-for-students-130054631.html\"><strong>Best Laptops for College Students</strong></a></p></li></ul><p>One more thing: Most of these suggestions are related to LCD screens, not OLEDs. While OLED makes a phenomenal choice for TVs, it's a bit more complicated when it comes to gaming laptops. They're mostly limited to 60Hz, though some models offer 90Hz. Still, you won\u2019t see the smoothness of a 120Hz or 144Hz screen. OLEDs also typically come as 4K or 3.5K panels \u2013 you'll need a ton of GPU power to run games natively at that resolution. They look incredible, with the best black levels and contrast on the market, but we think most gamers would be better off with an LCD.</p><figure><img alt=\"ASUS ROG G14\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/7a4d3480-e935-11ea-9ffa-4c77ce132136\" /><figcaption>Devindra Hardawar/Engadget </figcaption></figure><h3><br />A few other takeaways:</h3><ul><li><p>Get at least 16GB of RAM. And if you're planning to do a ton of multitasking while streaming, 32GB is worth considering.</p></li><li><p>Storage is still a huge concern. These days, I'd recommend aiming for a 1TB M.2 SSD, which should be enough space to juggle a few large titles like Destiny 2. (If you can afford the jump to a 2TB SSD though, just do it.)  Some laptops also have room for standard SATA drives, which are far cheaper than M.2's and can hold more data.</p></li><li><p>Get your hands on a system before you buy it. I'd recommend snagging the best gaming laptop for you from a retailer with a simple return policy, like Amazon or Best Buy. If you don't like it, you can always ship it back easily.</p></li><li><p>Don't forget about accessories!

While its 14-inch screen is a bit smaller than our other recommendations, it looks great and features a fast 144Hz refresh rate.
