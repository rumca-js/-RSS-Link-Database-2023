The match was played on a waterlogged Spotland pitch, in front of a crowd of 2,371, and afterwards the Rochdale manager Keith Hill gave the referee both barrels. “That wasn’t a spectacle, it was a farce. The biggest loser was the pitch. The pitch is an absolute disgrace, so whoever wanted this game on, for whatever reason, they are not looking at the long-term future. I don’t think the game should have been played. That’s forgotten now, it’s history.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/10/football-daily-email-harry-kane-spotland">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The real – and symbolic – power of the symphony has held composers in thrall for over 200 years. But what can it mean today, in our fractured and troubled world? </p><p>You are rarely more than a few days away from a symphony at the Proms, but at the Albert Hall this coming week it is a particularly big one for the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/series/50-greatest-symphonies">orchestral statement piece</a> that’s been at the heart of the classical music tradition since, well, roughly the French revolution. On 13 August it’s canonic centrepiece Beethoven’s Symphony No 3, known as the Eroica (Heroic), then through the following week further crowd-pleasers <a href="https://www.royalalberthall.com/tickets/proms/bbc-proms-2023/prom-41-beethovens-fourth-piano-concerto/">Shostakovich’s Symphony No 10</a> and <a href="https://www.royalalberthall.com/tickets/proms/bbc-proms-2023/prom-45-mahlers-third-symphony/">Mahler’s Third Symphony</a>. Moving beyond the heavyweights, the programme also features <a href="https://www.royalalberthall.com/tickets/proms/bbc-proms-2023/prom-40-martin-helmchen-plays-brahms/">a symphonic gem</a> composed by Croatian Dora Pejačević (1885-1923) during the first world war while she was working as a nurse, and a work that’s fresh off the press.</p><p>How can this single form have had such an enduring hold over the imaginations of composers and audiences alike for (at least) two-and-a-half centuries? What, exactly, is the symphony’s secret?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/10/come-together-the-democracy-of-the-symphony-musics-greatest-form-emily-macregor">Continue reading...</a>
