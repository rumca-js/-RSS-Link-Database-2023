The contract, worth hundreds of millions of dollars, was brokered despite Cherokee Federal\u2019s lack of expertise in the field.  \n \nIn a quote published yesterday by the Washington Examiner, Georgia Representative Andrew Clyde [R-GA] stated, \u201c[t]he nefarious greediness and behavior exposed in Project Veritas\u2019s video is incredibly disturbing and warrants congressional oversight. It\u2019s apparent that Andrew Lorenzen-Strait shamelessly views Biden\u2019s border crisis as a cash cow opportunity \u2014 raising serious concerns about numerous lucrative federal contracts. Congress must investigate Lorenzen-Strait\u2019s years long corrupt bargain scheme, which undoubtedly exploits both American taxpayer dollars and unaccompanied migrant children.\u201d  \n \nIn part two, Lorenzen-Strait, who says he worked out these deals directly with the Adams campaign, indicated Adams is focused on the \u201coptics of giving a thousand-dollar hotel rooms a night to migrants when he has a homeless crisis and some other housing issues.\u201d He elaborates that while the city is bankrolling the process, they\u2019re implementing contracts with other New York cities, like Albany. Lorenzen-Strait told our undercover journalist, they went outside New York City to make a deal with \u201ca group called SLS Co., which is knee-deep into contributions to Mayor Adams\u2019 campaign,\u201d is \u201cinept\u201d and \u201cincompetent. But that\u2019s this game.\u201d  \nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams, New York Governor Kathy Hochul, New Rochelle Mayor Noam Bramson and New Rochelle City Manager Kathleen Gill did not respond by deadline to our request for comment. \n\nSTATEMENT FROM VERITAS CEO, HANNAH GILES: \n\nOur investigation into Andrew Lorenzen-Strait uncovers even more shocking details regarding failed contracts with NYC Mayor Eric Adams over migrant housing through a process he calls, \"the Washington way.\" Undercover video reveals how Adams supposedly puts \u201cpolitics first\u201d when it comes to the migrant crisis plaguing his city. Project Veritas remains committed to exposing corruption of great public importance.
