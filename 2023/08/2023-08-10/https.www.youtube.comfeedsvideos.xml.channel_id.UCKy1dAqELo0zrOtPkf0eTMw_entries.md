On today's Daily Fix:
Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian Studios has detailed the second big post-launch update for the hit RPG. Hilariously, a couple of the changes fix bugs with genitalia and undergarments in Baldur's Gate 3. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet's Wiglett is finally getting its own plush at Pokémon Center stores, but fans are seeing  something else when they look at the official images of the new Pokémon plush. Finally, if you have been itching to dust off your PS1 or PS2 but wish you could use a modern controller like a DualSense, you're in luck. 8BitDo's latest product is a dongle that will allow you to connect modern wireless controllers on Sony's first two PlayStation consoles.

Reviewed by A.A. Dowd. Narrated by Max Scoville.

District 9 director Neill Blomkamp brings an appealing speed and cornball enthusiasm to his first video game adaptation, based on both the popular PlayStation racing series and the true story of a fan who traded the virtual steering wheel for a real one. The film is pure sports-movie hokum, done with just enough conviction (much of it courtesy of David Harbour, who's typically excellent in the stock role of a racing veteran-turned-mentor) to help you ignore how relentlessly Gran Turismo advertises the games themselves.

While Baldur's Gate 3 is being widely celebrated by fans and developers alike, some are panicking that this could set new expectations from fans. Good. In this opinion from Destin Legarie we explore why fans feel this way and why they're celebrating games like Baldur's Gate 3, and Elden Ring. The Baldur's Gate 3 reaction has stirred up a bit of controversy with some worried that Baldur's Gate 3 gameplay will cause a "raised standard" from fans. The Baldur's Gate 3 controversy is because Larian Studios has created something that others are worried will be compared to their games. The Baldur's Gate 3 developer reaction wasn't all bad, with some pointing out that it should get them to look closer at their practices, but many also defended the status quo.

Major props to some of the content creators who've also broached this topic.

The Last Voyage of the Demeter reviewed by Matt Donato. Narrated by Stella Chung.

The Last Voyage of the Demeter should delight horror fans raised on Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi, and offers an R-rated bite of vampiric brutality for genre fans with a stronger bloodlust. Director André Øvredal does well to transport his cast to a time when scary stories were told around lanterns in the dead of night, and even if the moodiness evaporates due to a protracted runtime and the foregone conclusion of Dracula’s landfall, the director accentuates the basics of violent feeding sessions in hair-raising fashion.

However, after meeting a fast-talking, foul-mouthed stray Boston Terrier named Bug (Jamie Foxx), Reggie finally realizes he was in a toxic relationship and begins to see Doug for the heartless sleazeball that he is.

## Take-Two CEO: Red Dead Redemption Port Pricing is "Commercially Accurate" - IGN Daily Fix

On today's Daily Fix:

Take-Two's CEO Strauss Zelnick is defending the recently-announced Red Dead Redemption port as being "commercially accurate." He was referring to fan feedback of the port being too overpriced and basically the same as the PS3/Xbox 360 originally. The new version is being released on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, but does not include any significant upgrades such as a resolution or frame rate bump. In kind of related news, Capcom fans are causing an uproar over overpriced DLC costumes. The latest DLC offering is for the four Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, but each one will set you back fifteen dollars. So a whole set is the equivalent of one brand new game. Ouch. In happier news, four friends who wanted to continue their adventures in Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles found a way to get their remote friends to play together. Oh and there's a new Modern Warfare III trailer.
