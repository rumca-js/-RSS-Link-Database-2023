<p>The Fall of the House of Usher, the latest Netflix limited series from Mike Flanagan, has a release date and a first look at the series.</p><p>This eight-episode series, which debuts October 12, is a modern-day update of Edgar Allan Poe's 1839 short story. The original story follows the Roderick Usher, an increasingly distraught man seeing and hearing strange things in his family's home following the death of his sister, Madeline. The series, it seems, will expand upon and reinterpret the original story.</p><p>Here's Netflix's official synopsis: "Ruthless siblings Roderick and Madeline Usher have built Fortunato Pharmaceuticals into an empire of wealth, privilege and power. But past secrets come to light when the heirs to the Usher dynasty start dying at the hands of a mysterious woman from their youth." The title of the story is both metaphorical and literal, with the house quite literally splitting in two and collapsing into the lake behind it.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mike-flanagans-fall-of-the-house-of-usher-gets-netflix-premiere-date/1100-6516777/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1599/15997278/4177307-ow2s6bpthumblarge.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p>The biggest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/">Overwatch 2</a> update yet has arrived with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-invasion-launch-trailer-reveals-whats-coming-in-the-big-new-update/1100-6516665/">Season 6: Invasion</a>, which adds new story missions, new modes, a new hero, and a brand new battle pass. The new battle pass, which costs 1,000 Coins (roughly $10 USD), features a variety of new legendary cosmetics and access to the <strong>new support hero Illari</strong>. If you purchase the premium version you unlock Illari immediately. In the free version of the battle pass she is unlocked at tier 45. The new cosmetics are themed around the Invasion, which marks a big battle between humans and Omnics in the Overwatch 2 lore. Many of the skins feature heroes transformed into Omnics themselves.</p><p dir="ltr">This includes the new mythic skin for Ana, A-7000 Wargod, turning the support sniper into a machine warlord. Just like last season, the mythic skin is now broken up into three separate tiers, with the base unlocked at tier 41 and additional customization options at tiers 61 and 80.</p><p dir="ltr">The new season also includes a new mode for multiplayer called Flashpoint, which functions similarly to Call of Duty's Domination game mode, with multiple points to capture around a map. There are also three new story missions to play, which cost $15 USD to unlock and play. There are also a few smaller features that have been added, like the new hero levels, which rewards special cosmetics, like player icons and player banners, for leveling each hero. Heroes are leveled by playing as them in multiplayer matches.</p><p dir="ltr">Here's everything you can unlock in the Overwatch 2 Season 6: Invasion battle pass.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/">Overwatch 2: Invasion</a> has launched, adding PvE story missions, new modes, maps, and a new hero. This update also marks the end of Overwatch 2 early access according to Blizzard, with the live-service game now being considered beyond early access.</p><p dir="ltr">As reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-has-now-moved-on-from-early-access-blizzard-says">IGN</a>, executive producer Jared Neuss told reporters that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-invasion-launch-trailer-reveals-whats-coming-in-the-big-new-update/1100-6516665/">Invasion update</a> marks the end of Overwatch 2's early access period.</p><p dir="ltr">"For me it's less about content threshold and more about, are we operating the game we want to operate? Is this the structure, the cadence, the amount of things we are able to make in release that we think moves us away from this learning period and into this, really operating a game at a full feature level? For me, Overwatch 2 Invasion is that moment," Neuss said.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-has-exited-early-access-with-the-invasion-update/1100-6516772/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Gal Gadot has shed new light on the next Wonder Woman film, saying she has been told that DC Studios will eventually make it, though it remains to be seen when or in what form. Speaking to <a href="https://flaunt.com/post/gal-gadot-the-eternal-flame-issue">Flaunt</a>, Gadot recalled what DC Studios bosses James Gunn and Peter Safran told her.</p><p>"I was invited to a meeting with James Gunn and Peter Safran and what they told me, and I'm quoting: 'You're in the best hands. We're going to develop Wonder Woman 3 with you. [We] love you as Wonder Woman--you've got nothing to worry about.' So time will tell," she said.</p><p>Back in December 2022, it was announced that a third Wonder Woman movie starring Gadot and directed by Patty Jenkins <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wonder-woman-3-not-moving-forward-in-current-incarnation-report/1100-6509818/">would no longer be moving forward</a>, as it didn't mesh with what DC Studios CEOs Gunn and Safran had planned out. But in more recent times, Gadot has said<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gal-gadot-says-shes-developing-new-wonder-woman-with-dcu-regime/1100-6516471/"> it's back on.</a></p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wonder-woman-3-gal-gadot-says-time-will-tell-if-it-gets-made/1100-6516771/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> Sorcerer class is incredibly powerful, by itself, but if you lean into its greatest strengths (and shore up some of its greatest weaknesses) it can become truly exceptional. Sorcery offers a wide swath of potent and useful spells as well as very flexible rules on when you can and canâ€™t use them. With an equally flexible featured class ability, Sorcerer is there for when you need to use magic on your own terms.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Baldur's Gate 3 Sorcerer build guide - Draconic Bloodline</h2><p dir="ltr">The best of the Sorcerer subclasses, Draconic Bloodline, lets you choose a dragon ancestor that you draw your power from. All choices will give you benefits to your Armour Class (13 AC as a base) and 1 HP bonus every level, and your choice of specific color of dragon will grant you an immediate resistance to a specific type of damage (Fire, Cold, etc.) as well as a spell that corresponds to it. Later on, as you level up, youâ€™ll also begin doing bonus damage when casting spells of that type.</p><p dir="ltr">Choose Red Dragon to get the powerful Burning Hands spell.

<p>Tragedy struck earlier this year when actor <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-horizon-and-john-wick-star-lance-reddick-dies-at-60/1100-6512458/">Lance Reddick</a> passed away, and he left behind a rich filmography. In video games, Reddick was perhaps best-known as the voice of Commander Zavala, Destiny 2's resolute Vanguard leader and a role that he had held since the first game launched in 2014. As a live-service game, Destiny 2 fans were wondering if Zavala would be written out of the story or if a new voice actor would take over, but his character will live on as Bungie reunites with a Halo legend to continue voicing him: Keith David.</p><p>No stranger to video games, David has appeared in <em>many </em>games over the years. He had an instrumental role in the Mass Effect trilogy as Captain David Anderson, the Arbiter in Halo, and a (highly fictionalized) version of himself in Saints IV.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Veteran actor Keith David will take over for the late Lance Reddick as Zalava in Destiny. <a href="https://t.co/SQXH417mQD">pic.twitter.com/SQXH417mQD</a></p>  â€” The Game Awards (@thegameawards) <a href="https://twitter.com/thegameawards/status/1689669995931017216?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">August 10, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The studio confirmed that David will voice Zavala in The Final Shape and beyond, but Reddick's existing in-game lines will remain untouched for the upcoming release.

This comes after Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian Studios said that staff that were left out of the game's credits would be added in a future patch.</p><p>"We take full responsibility for the omission of our freelancers' names and apologize for the effects that it had," Altagram said in a statement. "We are learning from this experience and are reviewing the failures of our internal processes regarding credits."</p><p>Altagram continued, "We would like to thank Larian for allowing us to quickly fix that error and update the credits section.

<p dir="ltr">DC Studios and Warner Bros. Pictures have unveiled a new clip from the highly anticipated movie Blue Beetle. Blue Beetle hits theaters August 18.</p><p>The movie traces Jaime Reyes' story--a college graduate who returns to Palmera City and unexpectedly becomes host to an ancient alien relic, the Scarab. This relic grants him a powerful exoskeleton, turning him into the formidable superhero, Blue Beetle. In the new one-minute clip, we witness a crucial Reyes family moment: Following what appears to be a cheerful fast-food meal and a gift of car keys, Jaime's hands instead land on the mysterious Blue Beetle scarab.

## Destiny 2's Strand Suspension Ability Is Getting Nerfed In Season 22

<p>It was only a matter of time until the Strand subclass got tweaked in Destiny 2, and Bungie has confirmed that the powerful Suspend ability is getting nerfed in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-season-22-storyline-weapons-and-everything-we-know/1100-6515517/">Season 22</a> when it begins later this month. With the right build, Strand has been an incredibly powerful subclass thanks to the Suspend ability immobilizing enemies in a psychic spider-web for several seconds, but Bungie plans to trim that facet of the ability down.</p><p>As detailed in a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/s22_abilities_armor_preview">new blog post</a>, Suspend removes some of the challenge that Bungie sought to reintroduce to Destiny 2 this year, and is seen as a "skeleton key" that solves combat problems against all combatant types according to the studio. This has escalating effects, as Strand's Suspend ability is so good that few players build into the Sever component that's also featured in this subclass, and the Stasis subclass has begun to languish as a result of this.</p><p>From Season 22, the base Suspend duration against non-Champion PvE combatants will be reduced from eight seconds to five seconds, and the Thread of Continuity fragment can be used to buff Suspend back up to seven seconds. Previously, you could have a 12-second Suspend effect with that fragment, but that's being changed.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-strand-suspension-ability-is-getting-nerfed-in-season-22/1100-6516753/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">A Moscow court has sentenced Russian writer Dmitry Glukhovsky, author of the science fiction novel Metro 2033 and its sequels, to eight years in prison. According to the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-crackdown-navalny-court-dmitry-glukhovsky-4d35046224f7f0f2cba076bb1544fe4a">Associated Press</a>, Glukhovsky was found guilty of deliberately spreading false information about Russia's armed forces.</p><p dir="ltr">Glukhovsky was tried in absentia and is currently not in Russia. This move is part of an ongoing crackdown on dissent in the country. The sentence comes after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent passing of a bill that imposes prison terms of up to 15 years for disseminating "fake" information that contradicts the Russian government's narrative on the conflict. Glukhovsky was found guilty of posting texts and videos on his social media platforms, accusing Russian servicemen of committing crimes in Ukraine, which Russian prosecutors labeled as fake.</p><p dir="ltr">In 2022 Glukhovsky was added to Russia's federal wanted list after demanding an end to the Ukraine war.

<p>A subscription to Disney+ is about to become a little bit more expensive from October, as price hikes are on the way. As part of its plans to make its streaming business more profitable, Disney will increase the price of Disney+ and Hulu standalone premium plans in the US by 20-27%.</p><p>Starting on October 12, Disney+ Premium will increase from $11 a month to $14, while Hulu without ads will go rise from $15 to $17.99 per month. Disney+ and Hulu standalone ad-supported tiers will remain fixed at $8 per month each in the US, and customers will still be able to subscribe to a combined bundle of the two ad-free services for $20 a month from September 6.</p><p>This is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-plus-price-hike-coming-for-ad-free-tier/1100-6514154/">second price increase for Disney+</a> in less than a year, after the entertainment giant upped the subscription cost in December 2022.

<p>Like Netflix before it, Disney is seemingly getting serious about cracking down on password-sharing for its Disney+ streaming service. During the company's latest earnings briefing, Disney CEO Bob Iger said the company is "actively exploring ways to address account sharing."</p><p>Subscriber agreements that include "additional terms" and updates to "sharing policies" will launch later this year. The executive added that Disney will "roll out tactics to drive monetization" in 2024, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/9/23826310/disney-plus-password-sharing-earnings-q3-2023">The Verge reported</a>.</p><p>Iger declined to share a specific number as it relates to people sharing accounts, but said it is "significant." Netflix, meanwhile, said it had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflixs-password-sharing-crackdown-finally-hits-the-us-heres-what-it-means/1100-6514476/">100 million accounts that were sharing passwords</a> until it cracked down and started charging fees.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-plus-password-sharing-crackdown-might-be-coming/1100-6516738/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Larian Studios has released another <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> update to address a file corruption issue that was seeing some players lose their saves.</p><p>Hotfix 2.1 is now live and it turns out that the problem revolves around those whose personal databases--which includes the players' progress and decisions--got too big. Larian resolved the problem by increasing the size to "infinite" to avoid overloading the capacity, which resulted in corrupted save files (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-update-fixes-game-breaking-bug-because-theres-too-much-to-do">Eurogamer</a>).</p><p>"As it turns out, many of you were doing so much in Baldurâ€™s Gate 3 that some of your personal 'story' databases (where your choices and actions are stored) got too big," Larian explained in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/6199820457237465522">patch notes</a>.

## The New Lords Of The Fallen Is The Most Direct Interpretation Of Dark Souls Yet

<p dir="ltr">A <em>Souls-like </em>or <em>Soulsborne</em>, a game that follows the core design principles of From Software's iconic titles, used to be a novelty. The original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lords-of-the-fallen-2014/">Lords of the Fallen in 2014</a> fell into that category, trying to capitalize on a budding trend yet falling short of replicating the type of experience that made Souls games so good. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lords-of-the-fallen/">upcoming Lords of the Fallen</a> is a second shot for this series, acting as a sort of reboot. Since the subgenre has evolved drastically in the years since, it takes a lot more to grab the attention of folks amid the sea of Souls-likes we see today. And after playing roughly two hours of the new Lords of the Fallen, it's clear developer Hexworks has a better understanding of what makes a good Souls-like click this time around.</p><p dir="ltr">While this new entry still contains lore loosely tying it to the original, 2023's Lords of the Fallen is completely rebuilt, committing to a much darker fantasy world and offering stronger RPG elements. The flow of combat that bogged down the first game is gone. In its place is a fine-tuned rendition of that familiar heavy and consequential style of combat where every move is a risk-reward scenario and dodge rolls are your best friend. It's responsive and relatively fast-paced--and from the boss fights and enemy encounters I experienced, the process of understanding attack patterns and exploiting opportunities while managing stamina felt right.</p><p dir="ltr">An impressive showcase of how Lords of the Fallen is doing things better this time around is in the very first boss fight against Pieta, She of the Blessed Renewal. Pieta's a knight that towers over you and wields light-based magic utilized in swift, far-reaching strikes of her sword, devastating AoE spells, and summoned avatars. Of course, there's a second phase to the fight where she transforms into an angel-like being who soars across the combat arena and casts even more dynamic light spells that home in on you. Defeating her turned out to be the kind of challenge expected of the genre's greats--it took me three tries, but with each attempt I felt myself getting better, gradually excelling at reacting to her attacks, rather than succumbing to cheap tricks and banging my head against the wall.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-new-lords-of-the-fallen-is-the-most-direct-interpretation-of-dark-souls-yet/1100-6516646/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

So we are definitely looking to make another one of those," Roven added.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/uncharted-movie-sequel-definitely-might-happen-producer-says/1100-6516737/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
