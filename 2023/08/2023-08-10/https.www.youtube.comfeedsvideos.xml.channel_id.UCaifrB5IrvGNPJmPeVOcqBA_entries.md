*An edited, illustrated and narrated playthrough of the game Dwarf Fortress*

 Sharpen your spears and oil your beards because today, my dwarves, we head into the northern swamps in search of monsters!

 Watch as a small band of hunters delve the deepest tunnels in search of quarry! Will they prevail? Or will the nearby shrine's guardian put a swift end to their ambitions?
