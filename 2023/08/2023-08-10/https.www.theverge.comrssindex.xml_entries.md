In my recent review of LG’s 27-inch OLED desktop gaming monitor, I wrote how the company’s warranty explicitly excludes “burned-in images resulting from improper usage.” And when I reached out to clarify, I couldn’t get a straight answer about burn-in coverage from the company.</p>

<p id="1XJomJ">But after four months of conversations with <em>The Verge</em>, LG Electronics has changed that warranty. LG now has a two-year burn-in warranty for its OLED gaming monitor in the US, Christopher De Maria, LG’s head of consumer PR for North America, tells <em>The Verge.</em></p>

  <p id="FTgb4O"><em>Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis</em>, a new game in the <em>FFVII</em> universe, will be released on iOS and Android on September 7th. The game brings together moments from other <em>FFVII</em> titles, adds some new ones, and will let you “experience the journey of a young hero Sephiroth.” You can <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1536905430">preorder it on the App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.square_enix.android_googleplay.ff7ecww">preregister for it on Google Play</a> right now ahead of the official launch.</p>
<p id="nC9ict"><em>Ever Crisis’</em> art style takes inspiration from the original PlayStation release’s blocky characters but updates it so that <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/inal-fantasy-vii-cloud-strife-cosplay/">Cloud actually has hands</a>. I think it looks quite charming, and it’s one of the reasons I want to play the game for myself.</p>

  <p id="jGCO7Q">NFL RedZone, the NFL’s excellent whip-around show that jumps from game to game to showcase highlights and key moments as teams are about to score, is coming to the NFL Plus subscription service. It wasn’t a total surprise: RedZone host Scott Hanson had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/9/23826392/is-nfl-redzone-coming-to-nfl-plus">teased the announcement on Wednesday</a>.

The key caveat with the service, however, is that it still doesn’t let you watch NFL Plus content on anything bigger than a tablet (like your TV), which might be a dealbreaker for some people — unless they own that new 14.6-inch <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23806084/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-plus-ultra-tablets-price-specs-features">Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra</a>....</p>

  <p id="cAxxsS"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> just changed the game. I don’t mean the fact that it’s become the second most played game on Steam right now, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed">catching up to Steam mainstays <em>CS:GO</em> and <em>DOTA 2</em></a>. I don’t mean how it’s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2023/08/04/baldurs-gate-3-stuns-with-nearly-half-a-million-concurrent-steam-players/?sh=6e293678596f">enjoying incredible success</a> without elements like a battle pass or microtransactions. And I don’t even mean how it’s a game crafted to appeal to a wide range of players across race, gender, and sexuality. Any one of these qualities alone makes <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> an incredible game.</p>

<p id="Mdp3K3">Lapsus$ made headlines last year after it took credit for the cyberattacks affecting major tech companies like Nvidia, Samsung, Ubisoft, T-Mobile, Uber, and Microsoft.

  <p id="PavvYd">Now that Elon Musk’s plan to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/23/23804629/twitters-rebrand-to-x-may-actually-be-happening-soon">rebrand Twitter to X</a> is in motion, the company is looking to sell a bunch of stuff tied to its previous image in what feels like a comically unhinged estate sale. Hundreds of items from X’s San Francisco headquarters will be available to buy via an <a href="https://bid.hgpauction.com/auctions/8660/herita10216?page=1&amp;pageSize=60&amp;orderBy=sequenceNumber">online auction</a> next month that’s running from September 12th to 14th. </p>
<p id="sLcjuO">Everything currently has an opening bid set at $25 so there’s the potential to grab some real bargains here. Most of the listings are for the kind of office equipment you’d expect from a big corporation, like desks, printers, and laptop docking stations. Several of the lots being advertised — such as <a href="https://bid.hgpauction.com/auctions/8660/herita10216/lot-details/6cdb344c-1e4a-4365-bf85-b052000578e5">soundproof office booths</a> and <a href="https://bid.hgpauction.com/auctions/8660/herita10216/lot-details/d6f88f83-8dc1-4014-8cff-b04c0063c5c6">designer chairs</a> — were also listed in an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/18/23560375/twitter-auction-company-assets-headquarters-bird-statue-coffee-machines">auction back in January</a>....</p>

  <p id="nox7bz">Apple looks set to be moving one of the most well-used buttons in iOS; the Phone app’s red end call button. Beta versions of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23787281/ios-17-preview-standby-live-transcription-stickers-keyboard">iOS 17</a>, which will likely get an official release this fall alongside the forthcoming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23678497/apple-iphone-15-news-rumors-release-date-specs-features">iPhone 15</a>, feature a redesigned call interface that shifts the red button down and to the right, and eliminates the distance between it and the rest of the call controls. </p>
<p id="VeTBW1">The new interface was technically made available with the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/141vhjv/new_call_screen_ios_17_dev_beta_1/">very first developer beta of iOS 17</a>, but it hadn’t been widely spotted until this week when the likes of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/08/apple-moves-button-to-hang-up-or-end-call-in-ios-17-beta.html"><em>CNBC</em></a> and <a href="https://gizmodo.com/apple-iphone-move-end-call-ios-17-beta-1850721425"><em>Gizmodo</em></a> covered the change. Here’s a before and after comparison of the call interface between iOS 16 and beta iOS 17:</p>
<div id="fR7qVj"><div></div></div>
<p id="NugTEg">To me, it looks like Apple has made the change to account for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23814601/iphone-ios-17-contact-poster-how-to">iOS 17’s...</a></p>

  <p id="3C8ecJ">Samsung is launching its beta program for One UI 6, its version of Android that’s based on Android 14. Key features for this next revision are a simplified design and more customization options.</p>
<p id="el5mUe">On the design front, “many elements have been tweaked to create a more modern look and feel,” according to a press release from Samsung. That includes a new default font and new emoji you can use from the Samsung Keyboard. The company has also updated the look of the Quick Panel so that you can more easily get to commonly-used features.</p>

## Google Docs and Drive are getting support for eSignatures

  <p id="rsYtRt">Google is adding native support for eSignatures to Docs and Drive in an attempt to make it easier for users to request signatures and sign documents from within its cloud-based productivity software, the <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/08/esignature-google-docs-google-drive.html">company has announced</a>. Google is now releasing the ability to request and leave eSignatures in beta, after more than a year of <a href="https://blog.google/products/workspace/workspace-individual/">testing the feature in alpha</a>. </p>
<p id="tz1Gu8">There are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22323097/pdf-signature-windows-pc-adobe-how-to">plenty of pieces of software that already offer eSignature support</a>, ranging from cloud-based <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21290101/dropbox-passwords-manager-vault-computer-backup-hellosign-app-center#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20Dropbox,users%20next%20month.">options like Dropbox</a> through to local programs like Adobe Acrobat. So Google’s addition of this feature is more about offering parity with its competitors rather than forging new ground, and means user’s shouldn’t have to switch between different apps and tabs as much while working...</p>

For £179 (around $227, though Logitech is yet to confirm a US release), you get the laptop stand itself, as well as a wireless keyboard and trackpad that tuck inside of it.</p>
<p id="KLldaG">Although it’s almost certainly cheaper to put together the same setup more cheaply with accessories from different manufacturers, the appeal of the Casa Pop-Up Desk is how neatly everything fits together when not in use. You’ve got your “Casa Keys” wireless keyboard and your “Casa Touch” touchpad, and they’re designed to fit inside the “Casa Book” laptop stand when you pack everything away at the end of the day.
