<p>US President Joe Biden has ratcheted up the technology trade war with China, issuing an executive order that will restrict investment in several sectors, including semiconductiors and AI.

<p>Zoom is one of the leading videoconferencing platforms in the market — and one of the most successful. But it recently made a decision that <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3704348/zoom-requires-employees-to-get-back-to-the-office.html">could significantly damage sales going forward</a>.</p><p>Zoom publicly indicated that work-from-home is not working for the company (hat tip to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/zoom-tells-employees-return-to-office-remote-work-video-conferencing-2023-8?r=US&amp;IR=T" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Business Insider for the initial report</a>), which is pretty much like a car company telling its employees to take public transportation. It is a clear indicator that the company’s software not only doesn’t make work-from-home viable, it never will.

<p>Apple notched another victory in its ongoing campaign to protect App Store profits after a US Supreme Court justice <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3571426/epic-vs-apple-is-not-about-freedom.html">denied an attempt by Epic</a> to force the iPhone maker to change payment practices.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-09/apple-can-keep-app-store-rules-for-now-as-top-court-spurns-epic?srnd=premium" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">widely reported</a>, Justice Elena Kagan denied <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/08/17/apple-developer-program-license-agreement" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Epic’s attempt to reverse a prior court decision</a> to delay implementation of an injunction against Apple’s decision to force developers to only use its own payment systems for apps.
