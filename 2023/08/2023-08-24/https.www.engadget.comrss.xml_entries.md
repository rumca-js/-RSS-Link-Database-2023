<p>Wing, Alphabet’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-18-alphabet-wing-drone-deliveries-us-virginia.html">aviation subsidiary</a>, is <a href="https://blog.wing.com/2023/08/wing-walmart-partner.html">partnering</a> with Walmart to kick off drone deliveries from the retail chain in the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) metro area. The flights will begin taking off “in the coming weeks” from a Walmart Supercenter in Frisco, TX, and the companies plan to expand to a second DFW location before the end of the year. The companies say the coverage area from both stores will cover 60,000 homes.</p><p>The service will be available to homes within about six miles of the supported stores. Residents in those areas can order things like quick meals, groceries, essentials and over-the-counter medicines. The drones can fly up to 65 mph, and Wing says you’ll get your items in under 30 minutes. They use a retractable tether to “gently deliver even delicate items” — including challenging products like eggs and frozen treats.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Wing’s drones are largely automated and monitored remotely. “Wing’s technology allows operators to oversee the system from a remote location, which means pilots won’t need to be stationed at stores or customer homes,” Alphabet’s company wrote in an announcement blog post. “The aircraft essentially fly themselves, so each operator is approved to safely oversee many drones at the same time.”</p><div id="4b723e8f6f2c46c085c13ab3b8f83ae2"></div><p>Wing has already <a href="https://www.engadget.com/alphabets-wing-drone-delivery-service-comes-to-texas-on-april-7th-120059178.html">partnered with Walgreens</a> for drone deliveries in the DFW region. Meanwhile, Walmart said in 2022 that its own <a href="https://www.engadget.com/walmart-droneup-expansion-164104899.html">DroneUp delivery service</a> had covered around four million households in Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Texas, Utah and Virginia.

## NASA reveals pollution maps gathered by the TEMPO space instrument

<p>NASA has published the first maps from its new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-launches-powerful-air-quality-monitor-to-keep-an-eagle-eye-on-pollution-170321643.html">space-based pollution instrument</a>, TEMPO (Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution). Although you won’t be shocked to learn it reveals higher pollution rates in metropolitan areas, the tool can help scientists better study North American air quality on an hourly basis. “Neighborhoods and communities across the country will benefit from TEMPO’s game-changing data for decades to come,” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson wrote in a press release today.</p><p>The instrument, which launched in April and orbits at 22,000 miles above the equator, can help scientists better study the health impacts of pollutants “at the neighborhood scale.” It can take hourly measurements, providing insights into the effects of rush-hour traffic, smoke and ash from forest fires and how fertilizer affects farm country. The tool measures sunlight bounced off the Earth’s surface, atmosphere and clouds. “Gases in the atmosphere absorb the sunlight, and the resulting spectra are then used to determine the concentrations of several gases in the air, including nitrogen dioxide,” NASA explained.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>NASA says it will share its data with partner agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Since taking the first measurements earlier this month, teams have been busy checking and calibrating the satellite’s systems ahead of regular hourly operations kicking off in October. NASA views the data as a boon in its quest to reach the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-cut-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-half-124537297.html">Biden administration’s climate goals</a>.</p><figure><img alt="NASA pollution map showing a region of the US South stretching from central Texas to New Orleans.

As expected, the maps reveal heavy nitrogen dioxide density over cities and their suburban sprawl.</p><p>“Detailed views of three regions show high levels of nitrogen dioxide over cities in the morning, and enhanced levels of nitrogen dioxide over major highways,” NASA wrote today. “As the day progresses, the morning pollution often dissipates. Later in the afternoon, it will rise again as the cities enter their second rush hour of the day.”</p><p>“This summer, millions of Americans felt firsthand the effect of smoke from forest fires on our health,” said Nelson. “NASA and the Biden-Harris Administration are committed to making it easier for everyday Americans and decisionmakers to access and use TEMPO data to monitor and improve the quality of the air we breathe, benefitting life here on Earth.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/nasa-reveals-pollution-maps-gathered-by-the-tempo-space-instrument-190539536.html?src=rss

## Dropbox ditches unlimited storage in its Advanced plan because of crypto goons

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/dropbox/">Dropbox</a> is killing off unlimited storage in its business-focused Advanced plan following a surge in shady activity. It <a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/product/updates-to-our-storage-policy-on-dropbox-advanced">wrote in a blog post</a> that as other services <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/02/10/google_workspace_storage_policy/">made similar changes</a> to limit storage capacity, it has seen an increase in people using Advanced plans &quot;not to run a business or organization, but instead for purposes like crypto and Chia mining, unrelated individuals pooling storage for personal use cases or even instances of reselling storage.&quot;</p><p>While there will of course be legitimate outliers when it comes to unlimited storage plans, Dropbox says bad actors &quot;frequently consume thousands of times more storage than our genuine business customers, which risks creating an unreliable experience for all of our customers.” It already has policies that prohibit abusive behavior, but the company says that creating a set of acceptable-use restrictions is unworkable. To that end, Dropbox is moving to a metered model.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company will gradually move current users over to the modified Advanced plan starting on November 1st. Customers will get at least a 30-day heads up before Dropbox migrates them to the new policy.</p><p>Over 99 percent of customers on the Advanced plan each use less than 35TB of storage per license. Dropbox says those teams can continue to use however much storage they're taking up at the time they get migration notification, plus an extra 5TB of pooled storage for five years with no price increase to their current plans.</p><p>The minority of users taking up over 35TB of storage per license will receive a similar offer but for one year. Dropbox will work with them in the aim of finding a plan that works for everyone involved in the long run. All versions of the Advanced plan will max out at 1,000TB of storage.</p><p>From today onward those who buy an Advanced plan with three licenses will get a total of 15TB of pooled storage. Every additional license will add 5TB of storage. Beyond that, starting on September 18th for newcomers (November 1st for current users), Dropbox will start offering storage add-ons. These cost $10 per month for 1TB on a month-to-month payment plan, and $8 per month if purchased annually.</p><p>If that all seems necessarily complicated compared with the previous version of the Advanced plan, there's only one thing for it: blame crypto bros.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/dropbox-ditches-unlimited-storage-in-its-advanced-plan-because-of-crypto-goons-195335867.html?src=rss

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/sony-interactive-entertainment/">Sony Interactive Entertainment</a> (i.e. Sony's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/playstation/">PlayStation</a> division) is looking to make more waves in the audio space.

## Uber raises its minimum age for California drivers to 25

<p>Uber has raised its minimum driver age in California to 25, up from 19, as initially <a href="https://apnews.com/article/uber-age-restriction-drivers-35ac187d3c8cb982cc1e352032efafc5">reported by</a><em>The Associated Press</em>. The company allegedly changed the policy because of climbing commercial auto insurance costs in the state. However, it only affects new signups; drivers already approved before Wednesday will remain eligible.</p><p>In a statement to Engadget, Uber chalked the decision up to the state's insurance rates and litigation environment. “California’s insurance coverage requirements for rideshare are baselessly higher than nearly every other car on the road: up to thirty times that of taxis and thirty times that of personal vehicles,” an Uber spokesperson wrote in an emailed statement to Engadget. “As a result of these lopsided requirements, personal injury attorneys have created a cottage industry specializing in suing rideshare platforms like ours, pushing Uber’s California state-mandated commercial insurance costs to rise by more than 65% in just two years. By increasing the age requirement for new drivers to 25, we hope to mitigate the growth of those costs.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“We hope to work with lawmakers, policy leaders, and industry experts to discuss legislative and regulatory changes that will improve the experience for all California drivers,” the Uber spokesperson wrote.</p><p>The new minimum age puts Uber on even ground with Lyft, which already required all US drivers to be 25 or older. The updated rules won’t apply to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-eats-starts-offering-autonomous-food-deliveries-in-fairfax-virginia-100023523.html">Uber Eats</a> drivers, who can still deliver orders as young as 19.</p><p>Uber’s business has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-q1-2022-earnings-lyft-144850929.html">bounced back</a> since declining during the pandemic’s peak.

## US Justice Department sues SpaceX for alleged discriminatory hiring practices

<p>The US Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-spacex-discriminating-against-asylees-and-refugees-hiring">just sued SpaceX,</a> alleging that the company engaged in discriminatory hiring practices against refugees and asylum seekers. The suit says that these practices occurred between 2018 and 2022 and that SpaceX “wrongly claimed” that export control laws limited it to hiring US citizens and lawful permanent residents.</p><p>The DOJ began its investigation in 2020 when the department’s Immigrant and Employee Rights Section received complaints of employee discrimination. Kristen Clarke, Assistant Attorney General of the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division, said in a statement that the “investigation found that SpaceX failed to fairly consider or hire asylees and refugees because of their citizenship status” going on to say that this amounted to a “ban” regardless of their qualifications. This is a violation of federal law.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The investigation also found that “SpaceX recruiters and high-level officials took actions that actively discouraged” these people from seeking employment with the company.</p><p>The DOJ lawsuit seeks damages and back pay for “asylees and refugees who were deterred or denied employment at SpaceX.” It also seeks civil penalties and hiring policy changes from the company. The Immigrant and Employee Rights Section (IER) even alleges that SpaceX ignored a subpoena related to the suit in 2021, forcing the DOJ to request a judge order the company to comply with document requests.</p><p>The IER opened this probe in 2020 after claimant Fabian Hutter alleged discrimination after losing a spot at SpaceX when asked about his citizenship status during a job interview. It's requesting other alleged victims to come forward and contact the department, particularly if they were discouraged from applying to SpaceX due to citizenship concerns.</p><p>Is this the only Elon Musk-led company facing legal troubles regarding hiring practices and employee treatment? Of course not! The self-proclaimed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-tesla-technoking-game-of-thrones-master-of-coin-142248051.html">“Technoking of Tesla”</a> faced penalties when a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/court-rules-elon-musk-broke-federal-labor-law-with-2018-tweet-195420903.html">federal court found that Musk</a> made unlawful threats surrounding employee compensation and unions. There’s also a suit making its way through the New York courts that alleges <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-fired-new-york-workers-in-retaliation-for-union-activity-complaint-alleges-113727293.html">Musk and Tesla fired workers</a> “in retaliation for union activity.”&nbsp;</p><p>Another big suit <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-11-13-tesla-lawsuit-claiming-racist-work-environment.html">alleged a racist work environment</a> at Tesla, which was recently settled for just over $3 million.

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/baldurs-gate-iii/"><em>Baldur's Gate III</em></a> is arguably the game of the summer, and it isn't even out on consoles yet. Developer Larian Studios has taken a &quot;it'll be out when it's ready&quot; approach to releasing the game on various platforms. After becoming an instant hit on Windows when it came out of early access earlier this month, <em>Baldur's Gate III</em> will land on PlayStation 5 and macOS on September 6th. The exact Xbox release date is still unclear, but Larian has finally confirmed the massive RPG will come to Microsoft's consoles later this year.</p><p>The main reason that Larian delayed the Xbox release (and thus <a href="https://www.engadget.com/why-baldurs-gate-iii-is-an-accidental-ps5-console-exclusive-200521291.html">making <em>Baldur's Gate III </em>a PlayStation console exclusive for a limited time</a>) was due to Microsoft's rules about games having feature parity on Series S and Series X. The latter is the more powerful of the two consoles and tends to deliver visuals with higher fidelity and framerates, as well as ray-tracing.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“We have no exclusivity deal that prevents us from launching on Xbox,” Michael Douse, director of publishing at Larian Studios, <a href="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/1685821250554245121">wrote on X</a> (formerly known as Twitter) last month. “The issue is a technical hurdle. We cannot remove the split-screen feature because we are obliged to launch with feature parity, and so continue to try and make it work.”</p><div id="0311ba744fa74f4e9d7514380c8ef811"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">All improvements will be there, with split-screen coop on Series X. Series S will not feature split-screen coop, but will also include cross-save progression between Steam and Xbox Series.</p>— Swen Vincke @where? (@LarAtLarian) <a href="https://twitter.com/LarAtLarian/status/1694737127978783157?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 24, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>Larian CEO and Baldur's Gate III director Swen Vincke <a href="https://twitter.com/LarAtLarian/status/1694736685894946925">said</a> that after meeting Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer at Gamescom, &quot;we've found a solution that allows us to bring <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> to Xbox players this year still, something we’ve been working towards for quite some time.&quot; Vincke <a href="https://twitter.com/LarAtLarian/status/1694737127978783157">implied</a> that Spencer granted Larian an exception to having feature parity between the Series S and Series X. On the less-powerful system, <em>Baldur's Gate III</em> will not have the split-screen mode, but the Series X will support that feature. Cross-save progression between Steam and the two consoles will be supported too.</p><p>Some third-party developers have <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/developer-claims-many-studios-are-asking-xbox-to-drop-mandatory-series-s-compatibility/">claimed</a> that the Series S is holding them back when it comes to delivering state-of-the-art gaming experiences. There have been <a href="https://gamerant.com/rocksteady-fleur-marty-comments-xbox-series-s-holding-back-generation/">suggestions</a> that studios making multi-platform games have to make tradeoffs when it comes to the Series S, such as not being able to offer 60 frames per second gameplay on the console. Now that Larian has obtained an exception to drop split-screen co-op from <em>Baldur's Gate III </em>only on the Series S, other studios might press Xbox to let them omit some features on that console too.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/baldurs-gate-iii-is-coming-to-xbox-this-year-after-a-series-s-compromise-174258062.html?src=rss

## The web version of Threads is finally here

<p>The long-awaited web version of Threads has finally arrived. After <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/07/introducing-threads-new-app-text-sharing/"><ins>announcing</ins></a> that its Twitter competitor would be accessible from browsers earlier this week, Meta’s rollout appears to finally be underway for a lot more people.</p><p>That means if you’ve been impatiently refreshing threads.net in waiting for it to be available, you should check again as access seems to have been greatly expanded over the last several hours. Up to now, many Threads users have been frustrated by the lack of a web version. Though it was possible to manually navigate to a specific user’s profile, people have been unable to browse their feeds, post, reply or even log in to their accounts from browsers.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As the app has seen a significant drop-off in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/threads-users-are-already-spending-less-time-in-the-app-182738755.html"><ins>engagemen</ins></a>t following its initial launch, many have viewed the lack of a web version as a significant barrier to the app. Both Mark Zuckerberg and Instagram chief Adam Mosseri have been promising a web version was high on their agenda for Threads, though Mosseri recently said the team was working out some bugs with the experience.&nbsp;</p><p>Now that the web version is finally live, it will be interesting to see which of the many <a href="https://www.engadget.com/all-the-questions-we-still-have-about-threads-153059430.html">“missing” features </a>Threads will get next. Users have also complained about the lack of content search — right now people can only search for users, not for specific posts — and hashtags, both of which help people discover new content on Instagram and Twitter.</p><p>One feature, however, that seems unlikely is the addition of DMs. Mosseri has said he’s reluctant to add another inbox to user’s lives, though he recently raised the <a href="https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/CwQyHXEhWcr"><ins>possibility</ins></a> of incorporating Instagram DMs into the Threads experience. But he did confirm that post-editing features are in the works, so at least Threads users won’t have to wait more than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-edit-button-131527359.html"><ins>a decade </ins></a>for an edit button.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-web-version-of-threads-is-finally-here-174909701.html?src=rss

There's Bluetooth for pairing with a PC or mobile device, as well as a dedicated "Share" button for capturing screenshots and gameplay clips.

<p>The right accessories can make an old <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-macbook-140032524.html">MacBook</a> feel new again, or level up your experience with a brand new laptop. For example, a good wireless mouse can be more comfortable on your longest work days than your MacBook’s trackpad, and it’s always handy to have a few extra chargers around.

Much like Logitech’s other webcams, the Brio 500 is a plug-and-play solution — just connect it via one of the USB-C ports on your MacBook and start a call. But you can customize things further if you want using the LogiTune software, which lets you change things like field of view, contrast, brightness, autofocus and more. The Brio 500 also supports Logitech’s RightSight technology, which keeps you in the middle of the frame even when you move around, similar to Apple’s Center Stage feature on its iPads. Admittedly, an external webcam will be most useful for those working with an older MacBook that still has a 720p built-in camera, but even those with new MacBooks can get use out of the Brio 500 — and if you spend most of your days on video calls, you’ll want the extra bump in quality and superior customizations that Logitech’s accessory provides. <em>— Valentina Palladino, Senior Commerce Editor</em></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Yilador webcam cover</h2><p></p><p>The built-in cameras on MacBooks may have gotten better over the past few years, but they still don’t include a cover for when you want a little extra privacy. <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ZaWxhZG9yLUNvbXB1dGVyLU1hY0Jvb2stTm90ZWJvb2stU3VyZmFjZS9kcC9CMDdUQkc3V005Lz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby0xdWMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjQ0MmYxNmJiLTJhYTMtNDBjZi04MTE5LWQ4MmY4NmMzZjcxZSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAdMQbIoiG-7UOpTnWWuzoMg8REJ3W-85WAhX5FbnVLTG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FYilador-Computer-MacBook-Notebook-Surface%2Fdp%2FB07TBG7WM9%2F">Webcam covers</a> like these from Yilador are cheap and effective — these are super thin at 0.027 inches and adhere right over your webcam, allowing you to slide a shutter over the camera when you’re not using it. They’re easy to install, and the adhesive is secure enough that the cover won’t fall off but you can also remove the cover and stick it onto a new laptop when you eventually upgrade. The standard black option is great if you want the cover to blend in with the bezels surrounding your MacBook’s display, or you can opt for a fun design that features pizzas, fruits or cute little characters. <em>— V.P.</em></p><h2>LapGear lap desk</h2><p></p><p>If you take your MacBook from room to room with you, you’ve probably found yourself working in some less-than-ergonomic positions.

It has enough surface area to fit 13- and 15-inch MacBooks, with extra side space where you can use a Bluetooth mouse along with your notebook.

Anker’s hub gives you eight ports: two USB-A ports, one HDMI port, SD and microSD card slots, one Ethernet jack and two USB-C ports, one of which provides 100W power to charge your MacBook. The USB-C and USB-A ports can handle 10 Gbps file transfers and you can connect a 4K/60Hz monitor to the HDMI slot.

In our tests, it recharged a 16-inch MacBook Pro from ten percent to 75 percent in 89 minutes — and that’s while using WiFi, a VPN, Slack and multiple active tabs in Chrome. The 140W power brick that comes with that laptop is too power-hungry for the 100W AC port, but plugging the USB-C end of the MagSafe cable into the Powerstation worked great. <em>— A.S.</em></p><h2>Roost Stand</h2><p></p><p>Hunching over a MacBook all day is murder on your back and neck, so it’s wise to make your everyday setup more ergonomic by using a stand paired with a separate keyboard and mouse.

You can even program the various buttons to do app-specific things using Logitech’s software.

<p>CVS Health is <a href="https://www.cvshealth.com/news/pbm/cvs-health-launches-cordavis.html"><ins>launching</ins></a> a new subsidiary unit, Cordavis, that will collaborate with drug manufacturers to produce biosimilar products, or medications that are near identical to an already approved and existing drug. This unit will commercialize and co-produce FDA-approved biosimilar products to U.S. markets, which will likely have a trickle-down effect on the way consumers buy drugs by increasing competition and driving down prices.</p><p>This subsidiary will not reinvent the wheel with new drugs. All the biosimilar products produced will be highly similar to an already approved biologic medicine but will still undergo testing and approvals to ensure they are highly comparable in terms of safety, efficacy and quality. If generic drugs are the Kirkland brand of medication — an identical product made cheaper through the expiration of a patent — biosimilars are more like Amazon Basics: less expensive, legally distinct but functionally the same as what they imitate. CVS claims that Cordavis will &quot;help ensure consistent long-term supply of affordable biosimilars&quot; when it officially debuts at the beginning of 2024.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The first confirmed offering from Cordavis in the near future is Hyrimo, a biosimilar of the drug <a href="https://www.humira.com/">Humira</a>.

This early offering gives just a snapshot of the kind of influence Cordavis can have on disruption in the drug manufacturing space.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cvs-health-will-begin-manufacturing-cheaper-biosimilar-drugs-153019696.html?src=rss

## Blink's Outdoor 4 security camera offers sharper video day and night

<p>Blink is today announcing its latest external security camera, the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9CbGluay1PdXRkb29yLTQvZHAvQjBCMU41SFcyMj90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby0xdWctMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImJmYzVlZDU0LTU1ZWMtNDM1OC04MGJlLWE2NTk2ZDAwMTliMSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAc3QzZzEbkcN6cWIRERX_vt3P6pOZc3aggHbdCgGUck9&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBlink-Outdoor-4%2Fdp%2FB0B1N5HW22">Blink Outdoor 4</a>, which boasts better image quality, improved low-light sensitivity and a wider field of view. For the quality claims, the proof will be in the viewing, but in terms of hard figures, the field of view has increased from 110 degrees to 143 degrees. It says the better image quality both in day, and night, are thanks to the company’s latest slice of custom silicon, which offers on-device computer vision. What hasn’t changed is the claim of two years’ battery life before you’ll need to replace the pair of AA batteries nestled inside.</p><p>It’s the second Blink device to offer person detection after its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-blink-pan-tilt-floodlight-wired-164318046.html">wired floodlight camera</a>, which was announced around this time last year. But that feature is only available if you opt for Blink’s add on subscription plan, which will set you back $3 a month or $30 for the year. Do so and you’ll also get the ability to get dual-zone motion detection and more fine-grain alerts depending on what’s going on in your yard. It’s available to order today, with $119.99 getting you one camera and a Sync Module 2, which enables you to hook the device to your local WiFi network.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At the same time, the company has taken the time to brag about its surge in popularity in the last year. It claims a more than 40 percent increase in sales, with more than 60 percent of that being to customers new to the brand. Of course, that’s probably aided in part by its focus on affordable hardware that’s been supercharged by Amazon’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazons-blink-security-cameras-and-bundles-are-up-to-49-percent-off-080100556.html">regular</a>, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-blink-video-doorbell-is-down-to-an-all-time-low-of-35-165025620.html">generous</a>, discounts on its first-party devices.</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/blinks-outdoor-4-security-camera-offers-sharper-video-day-and-night-140100728.html?src=rss

## A live CNN streaming channel is coming to Max in September

<p>CNN+ lasted barely over a month before Warner Bros. Discovery <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cnn-plus-shutting-down-warner-bros-discovery-155908886.html">pulled the plug</a> last year amid reports of abysmally lower viewer numbers. But the company still thinks there’s room for live news from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/cnn/">CNN</a> on a streaming service.</p><p>It’s bringing CNN Max to all <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/max/">Max</a> tiers in the US at no extra cost on September 27th. The new round-the-clock service will “be part of an open beta for news that will enable experimentation with product features, content offerings and original storytelling, all with the input and feedback from the Max community,&quot; WBD <a href="https://press.wbd.com/us/media-release/max-offer-247-live-news-streaming-service-cnn-max-launching-september-27-part-open?language_content_entity=en">said in a press release</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>CNN Max will feature original programming, as well as live programs from CNN US and CNN International. New shows include <em>CNN Newsroom with Jim Acosta, Rahel Solomon, Amara Walker and Fredricka Whitfield</em> and <em>CNN Newsroom with Jim Sciutto. </em>The streaming channel will feature several CNN tentpoles as well, like <em>Amanpour, Anderson Cooper 360, The Lead with Jake Tapper </em>and <em>The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.</em></p><p>Meanwhile, WBD will rename Max’s CNN Originals hub to CNN Max. Non-news CNN programming like <em>Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown </em>and <em>Stanley Tucci: Searching for Italy </em>will be available through this hub, along with the new 24/7 channel and more than 900 episodes of new and classic programming.</p><p>CNN Max is perhaps a less-risky bet for WBD than CNN+. CNN sank hundreds of millions of dollars into <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cnn-plus-release-date-streaming-151710197.html">that endeavor</a>. CNN+ was more personality-centric, while it seems CNN Max will be aligned with CNN proper’s approach to news. Having a blend of CNN and original programming should help keep costs down too.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/a-live-cnn-streaming-channel-is-coming-to-max-in-september-141316706.html?src=rss

## Discord's March data breach only affected 180 users, but it's worth a security checkup

<p>Discord started notifying users affected by a March data breach on Monday, about three months after the communications server went public about the attack in May. Of the <a href="https://influencermarketinghub.com/discord-stats/">150 million monthly users</a> that Discord reports to have, only 180 had sensitive information exposed in the attack, according to <a href="https://apps.web.maine.gov/online/aeviewer/ME/40/723efb4f-1987-4731-84ad-3c98a5afcf45.shtml">a data breach notification</a> filed with the Office of the Maine Attorney General. That means if you're a Discord user, you're much more likely to be impacted by <a href="https://mashable.com/article/discord-io-data-breach">the Discord.io breach</a> that impacted 760,000 users earlier this month, and ultimately led to the site shutting down.&nbsp;</p><p>Discord.io let Discord users make custom links for their channels. On August 14, a major data breach caused by a vulnerability in the website's code let a third-party attacker steal information and<a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/discordio-gets-taken-down-after-massive-data-breach"> put it up for sale on a breached data forum</a>. That includes hashed passwords, billing information and Discord IDs.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;We have decided to take down our site until further notice,&quot; Discord.io <a href="https://discord.io/">wrote in a post</a>. The company plans a &quot;a complete rewrite of our website's code, as well as a complete overhaul of our security practices&quot; as it looks for a way to mitigate the breach and prevent future problems.</p><p>This is different from the Discord breach that the company may have reached out to you about this week. A separate incident, affecting Discord and not the separate Discord.io entity, happened earlier this year when an unauthorized user gained access to Discord data via a third-party service provider. The hacker stole data on service tickets, which included personal information like driver's license numbers, for 180 users. Discord is reaching out via email to let impacted users know about the incident, and offering credit monitoring and identity theft protection services to prevent further damage.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/discord-data-breach-personal-information-discordio-shutdown-142950237.html?src=rss

## Ford F-150 Lightning Platinum Black first look: A menacing new trim for Ford’s flagship EV truck

<p>Since it hit the roads last year, the Platinum edition has been Ford’s top-spec trim for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1k1I_xYZo&amp;t=300s">F-150 Lightning</a>. But sometime in early 2024, Ford is releasing the first “buzz” vehicle for its electric truck which boasts an all-new color scheme that transforms the company’s flagship heavy-duty EV into a truly menacing (but still stylish) machine.</p><p>Limited to a run of just 2,000 vehicles with individually numbered badges, even though the Platinum Black edition is largely an appearance pack, it gives off a very different vibe than a regular model. The biggest change is the use of a matte black exterior wrap, which Ford says is the first of its kind on any of its production vehicles. However, the commitment to a new color scheme doesn’t stop there, because Ford tweaked a ton of little elements to drive the design home.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="6afbfd2cfaf943b197e8d890c5c8cf93"></div><p>In front, Ford smoked out the Platinum Black’s headlights to add a little extra drama. The company also updated basically all of the truck's badges, eliminating the blue background on the traditional Ford emblem along with the blue detailing on the Lightning logo on the bed, the tailgate and elsewhere. One small but notable design change from the standard model is that on the Platinum Black, Ford also got rid of the fake charging port on the right side of the vehicle, which is something I can get behind. If we can all agree that EVs don’t need fake grilles in front, that’s a pretty logical next step. After all, most ICE cars don’t bother adding faux gas covers for the sake of symmetry, so EVs shouldn’t either.</p><p>Some small departures to Ford’s matte color scheme are the use of glossy Agate Black paint on the side mirrors, door handles and running boards, which hide fingerprints better than flat black. Meanwhile on the inside, the F-150 Platinum Black features Nirvana black upholstery (with heated and cooled seats), which is exclusive to this trim. But what really completes the look is the Platinum Black’s wheels which, as you’ve probably guessed, are also matte black including their matching black lug nuts.</p><p>The rest of the car shares the same underlying tech and features as the standard Platinum model, which includes upgraded motors that deliver 580 horsepower and 775 pound-feet of torque along with Ford’s extended battery that provides up to 300 miles of range. You also get the 15-inch touchscreen infotainment system, premium 18-speaker B&amp;O sound system, support for Ford’s Blue Cruise hands-free highway driving feature and more.</p><p>The only real downside is that in addition to being limited to just 2,000 vehicles, the new top-spec version of Ford’s flagship EV truck also commands a very premium price of $97,995. But if you have the funds and want to try to put your name down on the order sheet, you’re going to have to pay close attention to Ford’s website when pre-orders for the Platinum Black F-150 Lightning go live sometime later this year.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ford-f-150-lightning-platinum-black-first-look-a-menacing-new-trim-for-fords-flagship-ev-truck-130002999.html?src=rss

## ‘No Man’s Sky’ update brings sentient robots and freighter-to-freighter combat

<p>Has there ever been a game like <em>No Man’s Sky?</em> It was dead on arrival when it launched seven years ago, but developer Hello Games has methodically updated the title, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/no-mans-sky-outlaws-update-space-pirate-hello-games-141127146.html">adding new features,</a> steadily increasing its popularity and eventually surpassing the lofty expectations for the game’s original release. To that end, there’s already been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/no-mans-sky-endurance-update-freighters-fleets-asteroids-black-holes-hello-games-142707325.html">three fairly beefy updates</a> this year alone, but get ready for a fourth. The developer <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/echoes-update">just dropped <em>No Man’s Sky: Echos</em></a> to commemorate the seventh anniversary of everyone’s favorite space sim.</p><p>The update brings some nifty new gameplay elements, like a race of sentient robots that promise “rich, new story content” and the ability to create your own robot avatar for battles and resource collection. Count on plenty of robot-centric missions and all kinds of affiliated resources to collect and use for building projects.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Space combat also gets an overhaul here, with an emphasis on “huge space battles” with pirate freighters. With <em>Echos,</em> freighters are able square up against other freighters for the first time, leading to some truly nasty and epic space-based encounters. There’s also new mechanics for defending fleets from pirates.</p><p>Those are the two big highlights, but the update doesn’t stop there. Players can now find and trade scrap weapons, including the just-released Atlas weapon. There’s also a new holographic museum that lets you display your favorite discoveries in your base for other players to visit.</p><p>Beyond gameplay elements, <em>Echos</em> fixes bugs and improves “rendering quality, stability and performance.” PSVR2 players get a graphics boost via foveated rendering and Switch players get anti-aliasing for crisper visuals in both handheld and docked mode.</p><p>Of course, there’s likely a reason Hello Games is releasing this update now, at the end of August. <em>No Man’s Sky</em> has never really had any competition in the “fly around the universe and goof around” genre, but <a href="https://www.engadget.com/starfield-has-been-delayed-to-september-6th-161635848.html">Bethesda’s <em>Starfield</em> launches</a> on September 6.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/no-mans-sky-update-brings-sentient-robots-and-freighter-to-freighter-combat-130022875.html?src=rss

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/atari-buys-the-game-studio-behind-the-system-shock-remake-165355144.html">Nightdive Studios</a>, a company known for remaking and upgrading old video games for modern consoles such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-long-rumored-quake-ii-remaster-is-out-now-on-pc-and-consoles-183652854.html"><em>Quake II</em></a>, has announced remastered versions of <em>Star Wars: Dark Forces </em>and <em>Turok 3 Shadow of Oblivion</em>. In the <em>Dark Force's</em> case, Nightdive worked in collaboration with Lucasfilm Games to breathe new life into the title using its KEX Engine.&nbsp;</p><p>The <em>Dark Forces</em> is a first-person shooter developed by the now defunct LucasArts and first released almost 30 years ago in 1995. This new version supports 4K gameplay at 120FPS and features cut scenes that look like they came straight out of much newer titles. Players can earn trophies and achievements and, of course, it now supports gamepads for modern consoles, because it's &quot;coming soon&quot; to the PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Series X|S, Nintendo Switch and PC via Steam. Nightdive hasn't revealed an exact release date yet, but it has promised another announcement later this year.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="555303823f284e64a20b8b7dc5425ccc"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>Meanwhile, <em>Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion</em> is a remastered version of the original first-person shooter released in 2000 for the Nintendo 64. Nightdive had also previously updated the first two games in the trilogy, <em>Turok</em> and <em>Turok 2: Seeds of Evil</em>, for young gamers and those who want to play them again on newer devices. Like the <em>Dark Forces</em>, the company remastered <em>Turok 3</em> using its KEX Engine. The game supports 4K resolution at 120FPS, features improved lighting and rendering, as well as upgraded gameplay and platform-specific features. According to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/turok-3-shadow-of-oblivion-remaster-confirmed-from-nightdive"><em>IGN</em></a>, the remaster contains some new content, including a new area and a new heads-up display (HUD) view.

## NVIDIA records mega profit thanks to its AI chip business

<p>If you've been wondering who's making the most money from the AI boom, NVIDIA may have the answer in it's <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-second-quarter-fiscal-2024">latest earnings report</a>. The company announced revenue of $13.51 billion in the second quarter, more than doubling the $6.7 billion it made last year and crushing market expectations. On top of that, it earned $6.18 billion in GAAP net income, nine times the $656 million it made in Q2 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>NVIDIA's gaming segment did pretty well too, thanks to $2.49 billion in Q2 revenue, up 22 percent from last year. During the quarter, it started shipping the budget-oriented <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-rtx-4060-ti-8gb-review-1080p-ray-tracing-130042416.html">GeForce RTX 4060</a> GPU, announced the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-omniverse-avatar-cloud-engine-142414993.html">Avatar Cloud Engine</a> (ACE) for games and saw the addition of 35 DLSS games including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/diablo-iv-review-a-mechanically-perfect-romp-through-a-shallow-world-160017353.html"><em>Diablo IV</em></a>. (Earlier this week, it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidias-dlss-35-makes-ray-traced-games-look-better-with-ai-130012143.html">unveiled DLSS 3.5</a> designed to use AI to make ray-traced games look better.)</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But it was very much the AI and data center segments that pushed NVIDIA to new heights. It saw a record $10.32 billion in revenue in that sector alone, up 141 percent from Q1 2023 and 171 percent from a year ago.&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier this year, CEO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/08/nvidia-ceo-we-bet-the-farm-on-ai-and-no-one-knew-it/">Jensen Huang said</a> that back in 2018, NVIDIA had a &quot;bet the company&quot; moment when it started using AI to power DLSS, &quot;and while we were reinventing CG with AI, we were reinventing the GPU for AI.&quot; He later added that &quot;the future is a large language model (LLM) at the front of just about everything,&quot; from VFX to heavy industry.&nbsp;</p><p>NVIDIA's prescience is now paying off with the company's flagship H100 Tensor Core GPU. It's also been building more complex systems like the HGX box, which puts eight H100 GPUs into a single computer. All of that helped it create immense cashflows with top customers spending heavily on NVIDIA GPU tech to build complex AI models — like Microsoft with its Azure segment.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, the company's use of custom software and apps makes it difficult for customers to switch rivals like AMD. &quot;Our Data Center products include a significant amount of software and complexity which is also helping for gross margins,&quot; said NVIDIA finance chief Colette Kress in an <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/nvidia-s-blowout-earnings-report-shows-chipmaker-is-gobbling-up-all-the-profit-in-ai/ar-AA1fGIGX">analyst call</a>.</p><p>All that led to a perfect storm of profit. &quot;During the quarter, major cloud service providers announced massive NVIDIA H100 AI infrastructures. Leading enterprise IT system and software providers announced partnerships to bring NVIDIA AI to every industry. The race is on to adopt generative AI,&quot; Huang said in a statement. &quot;Companies worldwide are transitioning from general-purpose to accelerated computing and generative AI.&quot; The company expects more to come, forecasting around $16 billion in revenue for Q3.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-records-mega-profits-thanks-to-its-ai-chip-business-084552302.html?src=rss

## DOJ charges Tornado Cash co-founders for laundering over $1 billion in crypto

<p>The <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/tornado-cash-founders-charged-money-laundering-and-sanctions-violations">Department of Justice (DOJ) has charged Toronto Cash's founders</a> with counts of money laundering and sanction violations.

While it's still as thin and light as you'd expect, he found that the combination of the large screen and powerful processing made it good enough that he could see using it as his only computer.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That's in large part due to Apple's M2 chipset that gives the 15-inch Air a great price to performance ratio. It also offers a comfortable keyboard and trackpad, plus battery life that actually exceeded the company's 18 hour spec for video playback during out testing. The bigger screen has a 2,880 x 1,864 resolution, but it shares the same pixels per inch (224) as that of the 13-inch version. Though it lacks the punch of the mini LED displays found on the MacBook Pros, the Liquid Retina panel still offers 500 nits of brightness and a 60Hz refresh rate.&nbsp;</p><p>While Apple's M2 chipset is a year old at this point, the 15-inch Air model only came out in June so it's unlikely to be refreshed anytime soon.

<p>Several months back, Sony teased a dedicated remote-play device for the PlayStation 5. Now it’s got a name and a price. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonys-playstation-portal-remote-player-is-a-200-handheld-just-for-ps5-game-streaming-140704336.html">PlayStation Portal </a>will cost $200 when it lands later this year,.</p><p>Aesthetics-wise, it looks like a tablet wedged between two halves of a DualSense controller. The eight-inch LCD screen can stream games at up to 1080p visuals at 60 fps. The device also includes DualSense features, such as haptic feedback. It can stream games from your PS5 console, so when someone else is using the TV or you're in another room (or even traveling), you can still play remotely via WiFi.</p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonys-playstation-portal-remote-player-is-a-200-handheld-just-for-ps5-game-streaming-140704336.html"><figure><img alt="TMA" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/b5fae110-4262-11ee-acf7-c921a8e08184" style="height: 450px; width: 675px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure></a><p>But it’s shaping up to be a surprisingly limited device if you’re outside of WiFi networks. PlayStation Portal doesn't run any apps locally, with everything pulled from your PS5. Handhelds like the Razer Edge can are able to run Android apps locally, while some third-party devices, think the ASUS ROG Ally or a Steam Deck, can remote-play your PS5, too.</p><p>The biggest omission could be cloud game streaming, something available to PS Plus Premium subscribers with a PS5.

## Apple backs Right to Repair bill in California

<p>Apple officially endorsed Senator Susan Talamantes Eggman's Right to Repair Bill in California, according to <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/79902/apples-u-turn-tech-giant-finally-backs-repair-in-california?utm_source=ActiveCampaign&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=Hold+the+iPhone%3A+Apple+just+endorsed+Right+to+Repair%21&amp;utm_campaign=PR_Apple+Endorses+Right+to+Repair&amp;vgo_ee=f8N%2FErBlt7tr2Ul%2Bom58vLwngNAIVWGsRQbMOLxqRrgHaQ%3D%3D%3ABHd3Y%2BaXHM1JVSjsSK6r7GXdljP6Kg5x">iFixit</a>. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-endorses-california-bill-right-repair-2023-08-23/"><em>Reuters</em></a> says the tech giant even sent legislators in the state a letter, urging them to pass Senate Bill 244, which requires companies to provide consumers and third-party providers the repair diagnostics and parts needed to be able to repair their products. iFixit's CEO Kyle Wiens called Apple's endorsement &quot;a watershed moment for consumer rights.&quot; He said it &quot;feels like the Berlin Wall of tech repair monopolies is starting to crumble, brick by brick,&quot; because the bill's passing could lead to a more competitive market offering cheaper repairs.&nbsp;</p><p>If SB 244 becomes a law, the parts, tools and documentations needed to repair products that cost between $50 and $100 will have to be available in the state for three years after the last date they were manufactured. Meanwhile, repair materials for products over $100 will have to be available for seven years. With those rules in place, manufacturers can't refuse to make information or components available after people's warranty periods are over. Companies violating the law will be fined $1000 per day for their first violation, $2000 for their second and $5000 per day for more violations after that.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As iFixit notes, Apple has had a long history of opposing Right to Repair rules and previously said that Nebraska would become a &quot;mecca for hackers&quot; when a bill was introduced in the state. Over the past few years, though, the tech giant has been showing signs of a change of heart. In 2021, Apple announced that it would start <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-user-iphone-repair-policy-change-173047862.html">selling parts and tools directly</a> to consumers and even offer repair guides to help them fix their iPhones and Macs on their own. &quot;We support 'SB 244' because it includes requirements that protect individual users' safety and security as well as product manufacturers' intellectual property,&quot; Apple reportedly wrote in its letter.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether Apple's endorsement can finally give the bill the support it needs to be approved remains to be seen. Eggman introduced the Right to Repair Act in California <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-07-california-right-to-repair-bill.html">way back in 2018</a>, but the bill was only able to amass significant backing this year. The Senate unanimously passed the bill, which will have its final hearing next week. After that, it will have to go to the floor and be approved for the final time by legislators before the governor can sign it into law.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apple-backs-right-to-repair-bill-in-california-072227964.html?src=rss

<p>Amazon is still working on a Fallout TV series — and we'll finally find out next year whether that's a good thing or a bad thing. The company has revealed that the Fallout TV show will premiere on Prime Video sometime in 2024, over three years after it first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fallout-amazon-video-series-announced-172346835.html">announced</a> that it was developing an adaptation of the franchise with the creators of <em>Westworld</em>.

## Meta approved hate-filled Facebook ads that called for violence in Europe

<p>Meta is again facing allegations it’s not doing enough to prevent the spread of hate speech and violent content in Facebook ads. A new report details eight such ads, targeting audiences in Europe, that were approved despite containing blatant violations of the company’s policies around hate speech and violence.</p><p>The report comes from watchdog organization Ekō, which is sharing its work to draw attention to the social network’s “sub-standard moderation practices” ahead of the Digital Services Act (DSA) going <a href="https://apnews.com/article/digital-services-act-social-media-regulation-europe-26d76cc4785df1153669258766cc6387">into effect</a> in Europe later this week. It details how, over a period of a few days in early August, the organization attempted to buy 13 Facebook ads, all of which used AI-generated images and included text that was clearly against the company’s rules</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Ekō pulled the ads before they could be seen by any users. The group requested exact wording of the ads be withheld, but offered descriptions of some of the most egregious examples. Approved ads included one, placed in France, that “called for the execution of a prominent MEP because of their stance on immigration,” as well as an ad targeting German users that “called for synagogues to be burnt to the ground to ‘protect White Germans.’” Meta also approved ads in Spain that claimed the most recent election was stolen and that people should engage in violent protests to reverse it.</p><p>“This report was based on a very small sample of ads and is not representative of the number of ads we review daily across the world,&quot; a spokesperson for Meta said in a statement. &quot;Our ads review process has several layers of analysis and detection, both before and after an ad goes live. We’re taking extensive steps in response to the DSA and continue to invest significant resources to protect elections and guard against hate speech as well as against violence and incitement.”</p><p>While there were a handful of ads that were stopped by Meta’s checks, Ekō says that the ads were prevented from running because they were flagged as political, not because of the violent and hate-filled rhetoric in them. (The company requires political advertisers to go through an additional vetting process before they are eligible to place ads.)</p><p>Ekō is using the report to advocate for additional safeguards under the DSA, a sweeping law that requires tech platforms to limit some kinds of targeted advertising and allow users to opt out of recommendation algorithms. (Several services, including Facebook, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-and-instagram-will-offer-chronological-stories-and-reels-to-comply-with-eu-law-103612256.html">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-will-let-european-users-decide-whether-they-want-a-personalized-for-you-page-120548491.html">TikTok</a> have recently made changes to comply with the latter provision.) It also requires platforms to identify and mitigate &quot;<a href="https://techpolicy.press/unpacking-systemic-risk-under-the-eus-digital-service-act/">systemic risks</a>,&quot; including those related to illegal and violent content.</p><p>“With a few clicks, we were able to prove just how easy it is for bad actors to spread hate speech and disinformation,” Vicky Wyatt, Ekō’s campaign director, said in a statement. “With EU elections around the corner, European leaders must enforce the DSA to its fullest extent and finally rein in these toxic companies.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/meta-approved-hate-filled-facebook-ads-that-called-for-violence-in-europe-030015537.html?src=rss
