Michael Fisher \u2014 better known as MrMobile on YouTube \u2014 noted that Citizen said it would suspend sales after he had reached out to the company about the watch\u2019s many issues. That was corroborated by a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/citizen-suspends-sale-of-cz-smart-gen-2-wear-os-smartwatch/\"><em>Wired</em> story</a>, in which reviewer Julian Chokkattu also detailed several bugs, like laggy screens, bad battery life, inaccurate tracking, and watchfaces that can\u2019t even tell the correct time.</p>\n<div id=\"0PRaLE\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Good move.
