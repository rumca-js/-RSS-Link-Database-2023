<p>Thousands of emperor penguin chicks likely died in Antarctica because of record low levels of sea ice that caused 'catastrophic breeding failure' in four colonies in late 2022, according to new research. Analysis of satellite images show the break up of usually stable sea ice and the disappearance of the colonies at a time when chicks had not yet grown their waterproof feathers. Scientists say emperor penguins face an uncertain future under global heating because they are so reliant on stable sea ice, which is projected to decline as the world’s oceans heat up</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/video/2023/aug/25/why-thousands-of-emperor-penguin-chicks-in-antarctica-died-in-the-2022-breeding-season">Continue reading...</a>

## Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend

<p>Spurs have found midfield balance, Sean Dyche needs changes and Brighton are still a step ahead of the game</p><p>The last time Luton visited Stamford Bridge for a league fixture, George HW Bush was US president, Bryan Adams was in the middle of his monster 16-week stay at the top of the charts with <em>(Everything I Do) I Do It For You</em>, and Liverpool had just broken the British transfer record by paying £2.9m for Derby’s Dean Saunders. The record has gone up a touch since August 1991 but again the Hatters visit west London in the wake of a new spending benchmark being set, and the player in question could well be in line for a first start for his new club. Chelsea’s £115m Moisés Caicedo had something of a nightmare debut from the bench against West Ham last weekend, giving away the penalty that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/20/west-ham-chelsea-premier-league-match-report">clinched things</a> for the Hammers, but Mauricio Pochettino indicated on Thursday <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/24/mykhailo-mudryk-joins-lengthy-chelsea-injury-list-before-luton-match">he is ready to start</a>. Despite decent performances against Liverpool and West Ham, it is now one win from 16 games in all competitions for Chelsea, and there may well be a touch of trepidation about the visit of Rob Edwards’ in-your-face Luton side, who have had two weeks to stew on their opening-day defeat to Brighton. <strong>John Ashdown</strong></p><p><em>Chelsea v Luton, Friday 8pm (all times BST)</em></p><p><em>Bournemouth v Tottenham, Saturday 12.30pm</em></p><p><em>Arsenal v Fulham, Saturday 3pm</em></p><p><em>Brentford v Crystal Palace, Saturday 3pm</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/aug/25/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend">Continue reading...</a>

The case, which shocked New Zealanders, has also prompted public debate over how the men were able to prey on young women for 4 years, and whether it reflects a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/28/new-zealand-must-tackle-epidemic-of-sexual-violence-says-childrens-commissioner">wider culture of sexual violence and misogyny</a>.</p><p>The two men, Danny and Roberto Jaz, 40 and 38 years old, sexually assaulted 18 patrons of Mama Hooch and Venuti, a well-known downtown bar and restaurant in Christchurch which was owned by their father, who is not accused of any wrongdoing.

<p>With residents aged from 58 to 94, New Ground is the UK’s first cohousing community exclusively for older women. Setting it up was an 18-year battle – but with soaring numbers of people living alone, is this an idea whose time has come?</p><p>Chipping Barnet, a leafy suburb of north London, is an unlikely location for a feminist utopia. Yet it is here, at the top of the high street, past the Susi Earnshaw theatre school and the Joie de Vie patisserie, that you will find Britain’s first cohousing community exclusively for women over 50. The purpose-built development is entirely managed by the women who set it up as an alternative to living alone.</p><p><a href="https://newgroundcohousing.uk/">New Ground</a>’s entrance, all glass and bold typography, could easily be mistaken for a co-working space, as could the common room I am ushered into.
