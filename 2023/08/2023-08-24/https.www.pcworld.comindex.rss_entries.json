The inclusion of the popular programming language went live earlier this week, with the feature available as a public preview.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/excel-blog/announcing-python-in-excel-combining-the-power-of-python-and-the/ba-p/3893439&amp;xcust=2-1-2041963-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Microsoft</a>, this integration is completely native within Excel; you won&rsquo;t need to run any setup for it to work.

You type Python code directly into cells using the new <strong>=PY()</strong> function, which then gets executed in the cloud. The results are displayed in the worksheet. In the examples shown by Microsoft, common actions like creating pivot tables and charts will be possible using Python. Microsoft&rsquo;s partnership with Anaconda, a Python repository that contains popular libraries like Matplotlib, pandas, and scikit-learn, should also enable more advanced visualizations.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-block-embed-embed-handler\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"wp-video\" style=\"width: 640px;\"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->\n<video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" controls=\"controls\" height=\"360\" id=\"video-2041963-1\" preload=\"metadata\" width=\"640\"><source src=\"https://wus-streaming-video-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/b0fdb8c9-a6ea-498d-a20e-a1e1edcc224d/ab0de05b-079e-41db-9c10-7bce9dbb_6750.mp4?_=1\" type=\"video/mp4\" /><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://wus-streaming-video-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/b0fdb8c9-a6ea-498d-a20e-a1e1edcc224d/ab0de05b-079e-41db-9c10-7bce9dbb_6750.mp4&amp;xcust=2-1-2041963-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://wus-streaming-video-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/b0fdb8c9-a6ea-498d-a20e-a1e1edcc224d/ab0de05b-079e-41db-9c10-7bce9dbb_6750.mp4</a></video></div>\n</div><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Microsoft&rsquo;s teaser video for Python in Excel.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The only potential limitation is that everything runs in the cloud&mdash;you won&rsquo;t have any access to local installations of Python, including any customizations you may have set up. This is in part for security purposes; Microsoft says Python in Excel is secured through use of isolated containers, with the code running in a hypervisor in Azure. Online workbooks are also opened in separate containers. (You can read more about Microsoft&rsquo;s data security practices regarding Python in <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/data-security-and-python-in-excel-33cc88a4-4a87-485e-9ff9-f35958278327&amp;xcust=2-1-2041963-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">this support documentation</a>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get started, you must be part of the Beta channel for Insiders, and running Excel for Windows (build 16.0.16818.20000). Microsoft says support for Python in Excel for other platforms will come &ldquo;at a later date.&rdquo; The feature is being rolled out gradually, however, so even Windows users may not immediately have access just yet. Also, some functionality will be eventually gated off for paid license holders. (Details to come closer to the official launch.) So if you want to be sure of unrestricted access to Python in Excel when first testing it out, you&rsquo;re best off doing it during this preview phase.</p>\n\nPersonal Software</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2041963/you-can-now-use-python-in-microsoft-excel.html", "date_published": "2023-08-24T21:09:10.591583+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Intel\u2019s 14th-gen chips will stay on the LGA 1700 socket", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever a CPU socket gets a little long in the tooth, it becomes a waiting game to see when new chips will render it obsolete.

Which graphics cards use which tech? Which game supports which standard? Can some of them be used on GPUs from different manufacturers? It&rsquo;s a bit of a mess. Fortunately, we&rsquo;ve got Keith May to explain it all on the latest PCWorld YouTube video. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make upscaling as simple as possible, what tech like Nvidia Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) and AMD Fidelity Super Resolution (FSR) do is this: They render the gameplay frames at a smaller size than your monitor&rsquo;s native resolution, pile on some advanced image processing, then scale it back up to native. It sounds complicated, but the end result is that the GPU is working a lot less hard to render those lower-res image frames and do some extra processing than it would be doing conventional processing at full scale. This means you can enable more advanced graphics and preserve faster framerates for smoother gameplay. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That &ldquo;advanced image processing&rdquo; comes in a lot of different flavors, and each GPU maker uses different tools to achieve it. Sharpening the image, spatial upscaling, using machine learning-trained algorithms that are customized for each game &mdash; there are some truly awesome techniques being developed to boost graphics fidelity while maintaining playable framerates. Nvidia&rsquo;s most advanced techniques require the custom hardware inside its RTX GPUs, while AMD&rsquo;s FSR and Intel&rsquo;s XeSS technology can be used across different graphics card brands if the game supports them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All this tech is cool, but if you have enough graphical power to hit your monitor&rsquo;s maximum resolution and refresh rate (1080p, 60Hz for most monitors, but up to 4K or 500Hz in some gaming monitors), you should stick to native rendering without any add-on tricks. That&rsquo;s especially true for fast-paced multiplayer games. But if you find your hardware struggling to keep up with the latest titles, give these upscaling tools a try. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For in-depth guides on graphics tech, be sure to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/@pcworld&amp;xcust=2-1-2041595-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">subscribe to PCWorld on YouTube</a>!</p>\n\nGraphics Cards</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2041595/upscaling-explained-nvidia-dlss-vs-amd-fsr-vs-intel-xess.html", "date_published": "2023-08-24T18:59:04.668517+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Samsung\u2019s massive 57-inch, 8K ultrawide monitor is up for preorder", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>How many pixels can your gaming PC push at once at 240 frames per second?

But it makes up for it by packing in pretty much every other bit of modern monitor tech, like a 1000-nit Mini-LED VA panel, 240Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and compatibility with AMD FreeSync Premium Pro. The massive, 42-pound display also uses a dramatic 1000R curve, so the edges of the screen will be tickling your ears while you play. (Not literally.

EGS is set to get even more of those exclusives very soon, because a new promotional program will let developers keep 100% of game revenue for up to six months. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/introducing-the-epic-first-run-program&amp;xcust=2-1-2041430-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Epic First Run program</a> (spotted by <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.kitguru.net/desktop-pc/mustafa-mahmoud/new-epic-games-exclusivity-program-gives-100-revenue-to-devs/&amp;xcust=2-1-2041430-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">KitGuru</a>) is a more open alternative to the kind of one-by-one exclusive deals that Epic secured for single games, like <em>Borderlands 3 </em>and <em>Metro Exodus</em>. Under the terms in the announcement, any developer or publisher that posts a new game exclusively to the Epic Games Store after October 16th will get to keep 100% of game sales for the first six months, an even more lucrative option that Epic&rsquo;s default 88/12% split. For comparison, Steam&rsquo;s standard platform fee is 30%, a similar setup to most mobile app stores and console digital downloads. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Epic insists that those games stay exclusive to its PC store for six months, devs can expand to Steam and other storefronts after six months and still get the standard 88/12% split after that. Perhaps more interesting, Epic&rsquo;s terms still allow developers and publishers to sell on alternate shops like Green Man Gaming or the Humble Store, or even their own website, so long as the game is still redeemed on Epic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The First Run Program is going to be appealing for a lot of game makers. That&rsquo;s especially true of indie developers, for whom an extra 12-30% income on each game sale could be the difference between keeping the doors open or shutting down. It helps that, thanks to <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1955105/get-an-awesome-metroid-inspired-beat-em-up-free-on-the-epic-store.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">constant free game giveaways</a>, Epic has a much bigger profile in the PC gaming space than it did a few years ago, if only because the company has given away hundreds of free games.

This DisplayLink USB-C dock gives you the power of Thunderbolt, but without the cost &mdash; and some features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might consider the Plugable UD-6950PDZ to be the larger cousin of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1485491/plugable-ud-6950h-usb-c-dual-4k-dock-review.html\">Plugable UD-6950PDH</a>, a double-display docking station that we reviewed previously. Neither the UD-6950PDZ nor the UD-6950PDH are &ldquo;true&rdquo; Thunderbolt docks. Instead, they both use the DisplayLink protocol, which approximates Thunderbolt capabilities but uses the DisplayLink drivers and protocol as a means of data compression. The difference between the two is that the UD-6950PDH routes two displays over this bus, while the UD-6950PDZ that we&rsquo;re reviewing here connects three displays instead. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A selling point of many, though not all, Plugable docks is the inclusion of more display ports than you could ever want. Most docks ask you to choose between DisplayPort and HDMI, or even use a direct Thunderbolt connection. Plugable offers both: On the back of the UD-6950PDZ dock are <em>three</em> sets of DisplayPort 1.2 and HDMI 1.4/2.0 ports, so that you can use whatever displays and cables you have on hand. That&rsquo;s way more flexibility than anything else on the market. There are also four more 5Gbps USB-A ports.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Plugable UD-6950PDZ offers just two 5Gbps USB-A ports on the front of the dock, along with a 3.5mm mic/headphone jack. A Kensington lock slot is mounted on the side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The dock is made from plastic, with venting on the bottom. It became warm under load, but not to worrying levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><strong>Further reading:</strong> See our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/393714/best-thunderbolt-docks-for-a-laptop-pc.html\">best Thunderbolt docks</a>, which includes USB-C DisplayLink docks, to learn about competing products. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Plugable UD-6950PDZ USB-C Triple Display docking station\" class=\"wp-image-2036176\" height=\"855\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Plugable-UD-6950PDZ-front.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The front of Plugable&rsquo;s UD-6950PDZ includes a pair of USB-A ports and a headphone/mic jack.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"some-words-about-displaylink\">Some words about DisplayLink</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/801587/why-new-usb-c-displaylink-docks-are-better-and-worse-than-thunderbolt.html\">DisplayLink docks</a> are not a &ldquo;cheap&rdquo; version of Thunderbolt. Instead, they&rsquo;ve proven to be a stable, inexpensive alternative to a Thunderbolt dock, enough that we lump them into the same category. They do lack the raw horsepower of a 40Gbps Thunderbolt dock, operating over a 10Gbps bus instead. On the other hand, driving displays tends to consume the bulk of that bandwidth &mdash; exactly what DisplayLink was designed to offset. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s even weirder: Plugable says that the 3-foot cable between its dock and your PC runs at just 5Gbps, and somehow squeezes three 4K displays worth of data over that. Black magic! The included cable was stiffer than I&rsquo;d like, however, with not much tolerance for my laptop&rsquo;s USB-C port. It almost felt like I was forcing it into the slot. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This dock is powered by the Synaptics DL-6950 chip, which incorporates what the company calls DL Compression 3.0, which does a better job adapting to the demands of what you&rsquo;re seeing on screen. What the UD-6950PDZ does is use the DL-6950 chip to form two sets of either an HDMI 2.0 or DisplayPort 1.2 connection, as well as use your laptop&rsquo;s ability to directly drive HDMI or DisplayPort over a third channel. It&rsquo;s confusing! Essentially, the dock is doing two-thirds of the work to enable three displays, with your laptop contributing the other third. As with most docks of this type, your experience will benefit from a modern laptop.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>That the Plugable UD-6950PDZ serves a fairly small niche shouldn&rsquo;t undersell what it can do: Crowding three 4K displays onto your desktop is still impressive.</p></blockquote></figure>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The Plugable UD-6950PDZ is also dependent on your PC. If your PC&rsquo;s USB-C port can output DisplayPort 1.4, the dock will support a 4K display at 60Hz. If it only supports DisplayPort 1.2, 4K30 is the maximum resolution it will support. Unfortunately, this can be one of the frustrating things about a DisplayLink or Thunderbolt dock, as it&rsquo;s dependent on features that often your laptop maker doesn&rsquo;t necessarily highlight.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Plugable UD-6950PDZ USB-C Triple Display docking station\" class=\"wp-image-2036177\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Plugable-UD-6950PDZ-back.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The  back of the Plugable UD-6950PDZ is chock-full of ports: the power input, the downstream USB-C connection, three sets of DisplayPort and HDMI connections,  plus four USB-A ports. Though Plugable&rsquo;s documentation indicates that one HDMI port is 1.4 and one is HDMI 2.0, they seemed to produce the same output.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-well-does-the-plugable-ud-6950pdz-work\">How well does the Plugable UD-6950PDZ work?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On our test laptops, the Plugable UD-6950PDZ supported three displays: a 1440p widescreen at 100Hz, and two 4K displays running at 60Hz. (The dock&rsquo;s display outputs aren&rsquo;t actually locked to a particular resolution; it&rsquo;s just that the available bandwidth is best suited to multiple displays at certain fixed resolutions.) I tried multiple configurations and cables, and it doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter whether I used a DisplayPort or an HDMI cable, and where I plugged it in &mdash; the output was the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re working in email, or Excel, or a web page with unmoving, fixed content, you should be absolutely fine with this dock. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&rsquo;t push it too hard, though. One of the tests we perform plays back a 4K YouTube video, just to see what YouTube&rsquo;s algorithm will deliver. The dock also played back Netflix videos on all three screens, proving that DRM didn&rsquo;t interfere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The actual YouTube resolution (measured by YouTube&rsquo;s &ldquo;viewport&rdquo; description) was less than what we expected, varying between a bit under 1080p resolution and 1440p depending on the setup. Hardly any frames dropped. However, there was some slight, noticeable choppiness in how the frames played back that could prove to be annoying. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We saw something similar with our storage tests. Running PCMark&rsquo;s storage benchmark, we recorded about 10MB/s less bandwidth (120.79MB/s) than other docks we&rsquo;ve tested, which isn&rsquo;t bad. But when we tested the storage benchmark while streaming our test video, the video dropped 234 out of 10,000 frames, which is a lot more than we&rsquo;d hope for. That&rsquo;s definitely noticeable.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-half-width is-float-right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"when-two-displays-is-enough\">\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen two displays is enough\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"plugable-ud-6950h-usb-3-0-dual-4k-docking-station\">Plugable UD-6950H USB 3.0 Dual 4K Docking Station</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Plugable UD-6950H USB 3.0 Dual 4K Docking Station\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"1013\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Plugable-UD-6950H-real.png\" width=\"1663\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__pricing-details  \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/plugable-technologies-ud-6950h/p/1DN-000M-00017?Item=9SIA2XB8EG9848&amp;Tpk=9SIA2XB8EG9848&amp;xcust=2-1-2031042-5-622429-16848&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$179.00 at  Newegg</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"amp-bar\"> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.walmart.com/ip/5AJ61GP2F2SG&amp;xcust=2-1-2031042-5-622429-16848&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$179.00 at  Walmart</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s another catch: There are no USB-C ports at all, which means that this dock isn&rsquo;t a great solution for charging a smartphone from the most common USB-C chargers. Don&rsquo;t worry about buying an adapter, either: the USB-A ports only supply 2.4W by our measurements, enough to only slow-charge a smartphone over several hours. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Plugable UD-6950PDZ also supplies a bit less power than other docks, a rated 60W that works out to 56.7W on our tests. That&rsquo;s perfectly fine for a productivity laptop, but if your laptop has a discrete GPU that&rsquo;s active, or if you have it running in a high-performance mode, the port may not supply enough power to charge it while on the dock. (In that case, the laptop will drain power, albeit more slowly than if it were running solely on battery.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our conclusion? This is a niche dock for those who need three displays. Otherwise we&rsquo;d lean towards the dual-display version, the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1485491/plugable-ud-6950h-usb-c-dual-4k-dock-review.html\">Plugable UD-6950H</a>, at a slightly more affordable $200 or so. We also miss the lack of smartphone charging, though it&rsquo;s not a deal-breaker. What the Plugable UD-6950PDZ accomplishes is impressive, though it has its limits.</p>\n\nComputer Accessories</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2031042/plugable-ud-6950pdz-usb-c-dock-review.html", "date_published": "2023-08-24T14:41:23.839776+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Cherry upgrades its legendary MX keyboard switches", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cherry MX switch, first released way back in 1983, is the backbone of the current mechanical keyboard craze.

After years of careful tweaking, Cherry is back to introduce a new generation of its original design, christened the MX2A. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming in familiar color-coded variations of linear, tactile, and clicky switches, the upgraded MX2A features a new barrel spring design that vastly reduces contact in linear movement as well as spring deformation and scratching. The redesigned stem with &ldquo;ribs&rdquo; on its crown enhances the effect, along with a light lubricant applied to the bottom dome right from the factory.

But that doesn&rsquo;t mean it has to be unnecessarily expensive. This folding 15-inch laptop with both touchscreen and pen is just under $1,000, which is a big value for the money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s a well-built laptop with a thin design, dark aluminum surfaces and slightly rounded edges and corners, making it comfortable to grip and carry around. At least in the folded position. If I turn it inside out, the sharper edges dig into my hand in an uncomfortable way. The 360 design is mostly for setting up the computer in photo frame mode or laying it flat on a table for pen control. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The computer I received for testing has an AMD Ryzen 7 processor in the 5000 series, built on Zen3 architecture and 7-nanometer technology. It sits roughly midway between the 12th and 13th generation Intel Core i7 processors in terms of performance, giving it plenty of power for all kinds of everyday use.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Looking for more options?

You get 16 gigabytes of RAM, which is standard in the price range, and a slightly small 512 gigabyte SSD, where some competitors give you 1TB. The disc isn&rsquo;t the fastest either, but you&rsquo;ll need to write large amounts of data intensively to feel the difference.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"HP Envy X360 15 &ouml;ppnad\" class=\"wp-image-2017448\" height=\"887\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/P_20230724_130058.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1206\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The HP Envy X360 15 meets expectations as a regular home office computer. </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mattias Inghe</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The processor seems to struggle to keep power consumption down, despite its 7-nanometer architecture. In my measurements, I can&rsquo;t get more than a maximum of ten hours of active runtime, with the computer turned on and with minimal use on a dimly lit screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The computer&rsquo;s 15.6-inch screen with 1080p resolution feels a bit like a relic of a laptop from five or six years ago. 16:9 format instead of the now popular 16:10, low brightness of 250 cd/m2 at best and color gamut just below SRGB standard. It&rsquo;s certainly not bad in the right indoor light, and viewing angles and contrast are convincing, but there&rsquo;s no real light or color intensity for either movie watching or creative work.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"hp-envy-x360-15-the-pen-is-a-plus-point\">HP Envy X360 15: The pen is a plus point</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s a shame, because with an excellent pen with good control, it could have been brilliant for drawing and detailed image editing. The pen provides direct and detailed control with natural pressure sensitivity, and is comfortable to hold. It charges with a USB-C cable, preferably directly into your computer, and is ready to go with your computer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the most part, however, you&rsquo;ll be controlling the computer with the mouse pad and keyboard, and I don&rsquo;t have any major complaints about those either. Except that the keyboard is somewhat cramped, to make room for speaker grilles and a row of navigation buttons on the sides, and that the computer&rsquo;s power button is an ordinary key above the backspace button, making it easy to access by mistake.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"HP Envy X360 15 anslutningar\" class=\"wp-image-2017450\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/P_20230724_130338.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Fast USB-C ports, but no Intel-exclusive Thunderbolt 4 support.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mattias Inghe</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Why manufacturers stubbornly continue to do this I will never understand, and I will whine about it every time they don&rsquo;t do anything to address that risk. Otherwise, the keyboard has good typing feel and clear backlighting, and the half-sized mouse pad is comfortable and provides proper control.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"hp-envy-x360-15-best-in-class-webcam\">HP Envy X360 15: Best-in-class webcam</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The speakers on the side of the keyboard, combined with two more on the underside of the computer, provide clean, distinctive and powerful sound. They&rsquo;re great for playing music, and also for reproducing voices. Together with a surprisingly good 1440p webcam and competent built-in microphones, the Envy X360 is all you need for a successful video meeting. HP even has an additional program that can start automatically when the webcam is activated. It uses the screen as a kind of ring light. Simple and smart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Connectivity and connections are no surprise. You get Wi-Fi 6e support, and four USB ports, two Type-C and two Type-A. The type c ports would have been thunderbolt 4 in an Intel-chipset laptop, but here you have to do without some features, like external PCI express. But you get fast data, power, and display port output on both type c ports. So, it&rsquo;s almost as good.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"HP Envy X360 15 penna\" class=\"wp-image-2017449\" height=\"795\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/P_20230724_130254.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The pen is high class. </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mattias Inghe</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>HP throws in some annoying bloatware, like Livesafe, Lastpass and Express VPN.

Clearly their mobility. The handy devices make it possible to work, surf, or watch videos in a relaxed atmosphere even on the train, while travelling, or on holiday. But because very few of us are on the road non-stop, laptops don&rsquo;t spend much of their time in their intended field of competence beyond the desk and power socket &mdash; quite the opposite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notebooks often spend a large part of their lives (if not the largest part) at home. Most laptop users plug their mobile computer into the socket at home, because then you don&rsquo;t have to bother with charging or discharging the battery at all. The same goes at work. Thus, the portable computer suddenly fulfils the role of a desktop PC or Mac without actually being designed for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nowadays, laptop batteries are increasingly built into the notebook housing and cannot be replaced so easily. So the question quickly arises: Does this constant charging damage the battery or shorten its life? We give the answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><strong>Further reading:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/436674/the-best-pc-laptops-of-the-year.html\">Best laptops of 2023</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading toc\" id=\"the-laptop-is-always-connected-to-the-power-cable-is-that-bad\">The laptop is always connected to the power cable &mdash; is that bad?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For older models, this question can be answered clearly and briefly: Yes, for very old mobile computers it is not a good idea to &ldquo;park&rdquo; them at the power socket. There is a risk of overcharging, also because batteries of old laptops are themselves quite old and have already suffered some wear and tear in the course of their life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With newer models, however, this is less critical: Resilient batteries and sophisticated software protect the energy storage device from immediate damage caused by permanent charging. Charging processes are stopped in good time and so-called trickle charging ensures that modern batteries are kept at full charge with minimal energy surges as soon as they become even slightly discharged. The MacBook or laptop no longer draws its &ldquo;working current&rdquo; from the battery, the current is diverted and taken directly from the main power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So everything&rsquo;s fine? Unfortunately not. Despite such protective functions, batteries that are permanently connected to the mains suffer from two chronic diseases: too much voltage and too much heat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Further reading:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394918/how-to-check-your-laptops-battery-health.html\">How to check your laptop&rsquo;s battery health</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading toc\" id=\"lithium-batteries-suffer-from-permanently-high-voltage\">Lithium batteries suffer from permanently high voltage</h2>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"this-killer-budget-laptop-has-all-day-battery\">\n\t\t\t\t\tthis killer budget laptop has all-day battery\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"acer-aspire-3-2022\">Acer Aspire 3 (2022)</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Acer Aspire 3 (2022)\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"1361\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Acer_Aspire3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"2000\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the bigger of the two problems: high voltage. The imposition on the battery is not so much the regular flow of current, but rather its state of charge. For with every percent of battery charge, the voltage in the energy storage unit also increases, and this affects its chemical aging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although this aging takes place in every battery, it is particularly rapid at particularly high or low voltages (i.e. at very high or very low battery levels). The recommended energy window with minimal wear for lithium batteries is between 30 and 70 percent of their maximum charge. If devices remain plugged in all the time, the battery &ldquo;dwells&rdquo; at the highest energy level and that means stress for the core component.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"too-much-heat-accelerates-the-wear-of-the-energy-storage-device\">Too much heat accelerates the wear of the energy storage device</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Problem number two: heat. Even without being actively used, lithium batteries lose charge all by themselves over time. If the devices are connected to the mains, such charge losses are immediately compensated and the battery is warmed up by regular micro-charges. This accelerates its wear and tear, and performance can also suffer. During active use, the temperatures in the case and thus in the battery then rise even more.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><strong>Further reading</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/829122/best-laptops-for-engineering-students.html\">Best laptops for engineering students 2023</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, we would not recommend constantly plugging and unplugging laptops at home to keep the battery in the optimal charging window between 30 and 70 percent. On the one hand, this is terribly annoying, and on the other, the battery has to be constantly charging or discharging, i.e. actively working &mdash; and that may be a tougher lot than having to maintain maximum capacity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lithium-ion batteries usually tolerate between 500 and 1000 charging cycles, after which an increasing aging process becomes apparent: the capacity shrinks. It is therefore better to save these limited charging cycles for mobile use when no power socket is available. Today, you also have other sensible options for protecting and conserving the battery.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading toc\" id=\"protecting-laptop-batteries-what-you-can-do\">Protecting laptop batteries &mdash; what you can do</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sustainable battery care is not particularly complex.

If the battery is not permanently installed, the best wellness treatment for the stressed energy storage device is simple: Simply remove the component from the housing when the device is connected to the power socket (but switch it off first!). When doing so, also pay attention to the correct charge level: For storage, a protective charge of 70 percent is optimal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-smart-charging-in-windows-2ac1b4ba-6027-410a-b80e-f6767d867002&amp;xcust=2-1-2038685-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Smart Charging or intelligent charging</a> under Windows: With modern laptops, you can do your battery a lot of good under Windows 10 and Windows 11 with this function. The maximum capacity of the battery is temporarily redefined: to about 80 percent of the actual maximum. In this way, the battery always remains in a healthy energy window even when the power connection is active. With Lenovo laptops, for example, this also works in their own manager called <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/software/vantage&amp;xcust=2-1-2038685-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lenovo Vantage</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has its own helpful suggestions for <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.apple.com/batteries/maximizing-performance/&amp;xcust=2-1-2038685-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">maximizing battery performance</a> in a MacBook. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do not recharge the battery immediately: If you have only slightly drained the battery during mobile use, you do not have to recharge it immediately. Remember that the battery feels most comfortable between 30 and 70 percent of its maximum charge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Avoid cheap components: When buying charging cables and adapters, it pays not to be too stingy. The cheapest devices promise to save a few dollars, but often have poor charge control or cheap circuitry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Avoid temperatures that are too high or too low: Whether laptops, MacBooks or smartphones: Lithium batteries work best in a temperature window of -10 to +40 degrees Celsius. Direct sunlight is therefore taboo, especially in summer, and you should also refrain from charging when batteries are very hot or very cold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article was translated from German to English and originally appeared on pcwelt.de.</em></p>\n\nLaptops, MacBook</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2038685/laptop-always-plugged-in-is-that-bad.html", "date_published": "2023-08-24T11:26:47.496708+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Alienware\u2019s 500Hz gaming monitor just got a lot cheaper", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>The Alienware AW2524H is the fastest gaming monitor on the planet, spitting out 500 refreshes per second &mdash; if your gaming PC can handle it, of course. Your wallet has to be pretty beefy to handle it too, thanks to an $830 price tag. If that&rsquo;s giving you sticker shock, then you might want to check out the new AW2524HF, which swaps out the G-Sync tech for <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/423202/g-sync-vs-freesync-amd-nvidia-monitor.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AMD&rsquo;s platform-agnostic FreeSync</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new monitor is $650, an impressive discount. Granted, that&rsquo;s still pretty dang pricey, especially for a 24-inch, 1080p screen. But for esports aspirants who need the absolute fastest thing around, it might just be worth it. AMD&rsquo;s FreeSync will work with both AMD and Nvidia graphics cards&hellip;and frankly, if you have a PC that can pump out 500 frames every second, you probably won&rsquo;t be noticing any screen tearing anyway. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other charms of the refreshed hardware include a color-accurate IPS panel with .5ms response time, DisplayPort 1.4 and double HDMI inputs, four USB 3.2 ports for gadgets and charging, a spring-loaded headset hanger, and a hexagonal base designed specifically with an oddly angled keyboard in mind. If that&rsquo;s not your jam, a standard VESA mount is hanging &rsquo;round back. The AMD flavor of the monitor drops the RGB-illuminated rear logo, which is a fine trade-off if you ask me. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Alienware AW2524HF will go on sale on Dell&rsquo;s website on September 12.
