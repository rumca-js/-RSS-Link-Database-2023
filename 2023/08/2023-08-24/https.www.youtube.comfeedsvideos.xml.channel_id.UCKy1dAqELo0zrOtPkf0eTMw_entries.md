Mysterious voices traverse the airwaves questioning you, warning you. Through your battles against the elements and the Exclusion Zone's anomalies only one thing is certain: you and your car won’t leave unchanged.

Left untouched for over 30 years, the Olympic Exclusion Zone is home to all manners of hazards and mysterious phenomena known as anomalies. With only your station wagon for company, navigate the winding roads as you attempt to untangle a web of secrets that have surrounded the area since the '50s. Gather resources to upgrade your car and uncover more clues as you venture further and farther out into the unknown.

Pacific Drive will be available on PlayStation 5 and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store) in early 2024.

Zack Snyder is back at Netflix, this time with the first trailer for his new two-part sci-fi epic, Rebel Moon. Famously once pitched as a Star Wars movie, Snyder has taken the idea and created a brand-new, original set of films.

The trailer hints that this epic sci-fi/fantasy film has everything from Warhammer to Dune to John Carter of Mars in its DNA. Let's break down this new footage and all the references we found to familiar sci-fi and samurai movies.

Rebel Moon: Part One - A Child of Fire stars  Sofia Boutella, Charlie Hunnam, Michiel Huisman, Djimon Hounsou, Doona Bae, Ray Fisher, Cleopatra Coleman, Jena Malone, Fra Fee, Ed Skrein and Anthony Hopkins. The film debuts on Netflix on December 22, 2023.
