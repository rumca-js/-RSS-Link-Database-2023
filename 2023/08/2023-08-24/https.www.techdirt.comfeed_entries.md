This case involves both civil forfeiture and criminal forfeiture. First one, then the other. Not that the order matters as much as the government&#8217;s unwillingness to do much more than sit on the $30,000 in cash they took from an Ohio couple during a supposed drug investigation. Civil forfeiture allows the government to keep seized [&#8230;]

Back in June, we wrote about a ridiculously weak lawsuit from the big music publishers against exTwitter, claiming that the platform, mostly known for text, and which barely has any reasonable system for posting or listening to music, was a music piracy haven. As we noted, the publishers’ lawsuit seemed misguided in multiple ways, beyond [&#8230;]

I guess the feeling was that some protesters needed to be arrested. And when most protesters are protesting cops, it&#8217;s probably a whole lot easier to go after those that aren&#8217;t. That&#8217;s how this lawsuit got started. Following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, protests against police violence began all [&#8230;]

Stephen Thaler has spent years trying, and almost always failing, to convince both patent and copyright bodies to give him patents and copyrights on works he says are created by AI systems he’s built. He’s failed at this process. A lot. I mean, really, a lot. His latest attempt was to sue the Copyright Office [&#8230;]

## NHTSA Backtracks On Its Dumb Opposition To ‘Right To Repair’

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has backed off of its ill-advised opposition to right to repair after presumably getting an earful from reformers and the Biden administration. This past June, NHTSA issued guidance advising the auto industry to basically ignore Massachusetts&#8217; new right to repair law, which required that all modern vehicle systems [&#8230;]

## Ohio Court Tells Cops They Need To Know The Law If They’re Going To Engage In Pretextual Stops

Pretextual stops are law enforcement&#8217;s favorite way to fish for larger catches. Any minor moving violation can predicate a stop. That leads to conversations &#8212; often non-consensual &#8212; with drivers and passengers. Any number of factors can be opportunistically read by officers to add up to &#8220;reasonable suspicion.&#8221; Once that &#8220;develops,&#8221; the party begins. Cars, [&#8230;]
