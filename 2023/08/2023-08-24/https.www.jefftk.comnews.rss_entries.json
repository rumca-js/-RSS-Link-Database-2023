It's a k45ss,\nfrom maybe the early 80s, and the general advice I see is that with\ntypical home use they should be regreased every ~10y.  I ordered 4oz of\nfood-safe synthetic </span>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08ZYCQVRD\">grease</a> and followed\nMr. Mixer's YouTube guide (parts \n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW9BQ-oPFkk\">1</a>, \n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-qMOyhb2xc\">2</a>, \n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmnD6Y5jNMg\">3</a>).  With my\nphone playing the videos I followed along: opening the mixer up,\nremoving the old grease, adding the new grease, and putting it back\ntogether.  There were slight differences (my strain relief was\nannoying, and I didn't have a \n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/L-qMOyhb2xc?si=dYgKmFXzWSKtX7o1&amp;t=133\">pin</a>\ninside the gear assembly and needed to remove the worm assembly first\ninstead) but it was pretty close.\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nThe planetary gear assembly was pretty low on grease, and the grease\nthere was a bit dry:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/kitchen-aid-planetary-low-grease-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"366\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/kitchen-aid-planetary-low-grease.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe upper area had more grease, though the grease was a harder\nthan I expect it was supposed to be:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/kitchen-aid-head-internal-old-grease-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"664\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/kitchen-aid-head-internal-old-grease.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe gears were in good shape, and were nice and solid feeling.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nDegreasing, regreasing, and assembly went fine. Probably 1.5hr all\ntogether? When I was done, however, I realized I had a part left over:\none of three washers.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/kitchen-aid-extra-washer-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/kitchen-aid-extra-washer.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI looked back over the video, and it talked about installing two of\nthese washers, which I remembered doing, but I was stumped by how I\nended up with a third.  There wasn't any logical place which should\nhave a washer but didn't.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI talked about this at dinner, and one of my housemates said they also\nhad an old KitchenAid that had probably never been regreased (k45,\ncord isn't grounded, maybe late 60s). We decided to do theirs\ntogether, and maybe we'd see where the washer went.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe combination of having a second pair of hands and having just done\none the previous evening made it go a lot faster: less than an\nhour. Very similar to mine, except the strain relief was even more\nannoying. We did figure out the washer mystery, though: there are two\nwashers in the planetary mechanism, stacked on top of each other.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI'm not sure whether it's worth opening the bottom of mine back up to\ninstall the extra washer.  I'm leaning towards yes (they wouldn't put\nin two washers for no reason, doesn't require taking the whole thing\napart) but possibly I don't really need to?\n\n  </p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/regreasing-a-kitchenaid-mixer", "date_published": "2023-08-24T02:41:34.853390+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}]
