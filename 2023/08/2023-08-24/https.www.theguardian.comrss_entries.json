[{"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Amputating Alice review \u2013 a surprisingly jaunty look at an extremely likable Paralympian", "description": "<p>Puns and dry humour abound in this inspiring documentary about Paralympic gold medallist Alice Tai \u2013 and her journey from elective leg surgery to the 2022 Commonwealth Games</p><p>A couple of years ago, the swimmer and Paralympic gold medallist Alice Tai was talking to The Last Leg presenter Adam Hills about her recent decision to have her right leg amputated to improve her quality of life. Hills had a question for her: why wasn\u2019t anybody filming her story? The result is Amputating Alice, a charming one-off documentary about Tai\u2019s spectacular career to date, her surgery, recovery and eventual return to competitive sport.</p><p>Anyone scrolling through the listings may see the title and expect a certain sort of film. However, they will be pleasantly surprised by its jaunty tone and I suspect that a bit of misdirection is the point. The programme is irreverent from the off, as Hills narrates an atmospheric shot of Tai floating in a pool. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, she hasn\u2019t died. But she has just had her leg cut off.\u201d He waits a fraction of a second. \u201cIronically, though, that\u2019s jumping ahead.\u201d Hills, who has a prosthetic leg himself, meets Tai about halfway through the film, to offer advice and support, but it\u2019s Tai\u2019s story and she is the one who carries it.</p><p>Amputating Alice is on Channel 4.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/aug/24/amputating-alice-review-paralympian-alice-tai-channel-4-documentary\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/aug/24/amputating-alice-review-paralympian-alice-tai-channel-4-documentary", "date_published": "2023-08-24T23:19:16.209515+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Dementia risk study finds 11 key factors behind condition", "description": "<p>Predictive tool \u2018significantly outperforms\u2019 others available and could help avert about 40% of cases</p><p>Scientists have identified 11 risk factors for dementia and used them to develop a tool that can predict whether someone will develop the condition in the next 14 years.</p><p>The number of people living with dementia globally is forecast to nearly triple to 153 million by 2050, and experts have said that it presents a rapidly growing threat to future health and social care systems.

Sadie Sandler as Ronnie, the sardonic older sister who can drive, and Sunny Sandler as Stacy Friedman, a 13-year-old struggling with her first crush, first BFF fight and one and only batmitzvah, are clearly actors in training. But the Sandlers\u2019 affectionate rapport and palpable family chemistry lends the film, based on the book by Fiona Rosenbloom, a rare, sweet charm.</p><p>Credit as well to the director Sammi Cohen, working with a screenplay from Alison Peck, for an evocative enough rendering of middle school, that very tricky window between the innocence of childhood and the full thicket of teenage angst. Stacy\u2019s fantasy for her perfect batmitzvah is at once distinctly seventh grade, specific to a certain slice of Brooklyn Jewishness and broadly comic: hot pink and sparkly, very extra, a fete of social adulation featuring a cheesy DJ and punctuated by her longtime best friend Lydia (Samantha Lorraine, the standout of the youth cast) and her floppy-haired crush Andy (Dylan Hoffman). Stacy\u2019s world of Hebrew school coming-of-age ceremonies is serious and silly, a parade of Torah recitations and Twizzler stations, and thus her delusions of batmitzvah grandeur (hired pop stars) are rendered both heartfelt and comic. \u201cYou\u2019re always saying how my batmitzvah determines the rest of my life,\u201d Stacy tells her parents (Sandler and his Uncut Gems co-star Idina Menzel), \u201cand I think Dua Lipa will make my life perfect.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/24/youre-so-not-invited-to-my-bat-mitzvah-netflix-movie-review-adam-sandler\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/24/youre-so-not-invited-to-my-bat-mitzvah-netflix-movie-review-adam-sandler", "date_published": "2023-08-24T21:09:28.912230+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Ian Smith: Crushing review \u2013 there are few fringe shows as purely funny as this", "description": "<p><strong>Monkey Barrel at The Tron, Edinburgh<br /></strong>In an act mining similar territory to Rhod Gilbert, Smith flounders in everyday life and revels in being the butt of the joke</p><p>The little guy floundering at life is a well-worn \u2013 and evergreen, in the right hands \u2013 comedy persona.
