In the encoding tactic, perturbations are small alterations to the latent representation of an image that an AI engine \u201csees\u201d in mathematical code. By making changes to the code, PhotoGuard \u201cimmunizes\u201d the image by making it incomprehensible to AI, which can then only perceive it as a random entity. The resulting output will be unrealistic and recognizably altered \u2013 faces on a grey field, for instance, or unblended into a blurred background.\n\nOn a defensive level, PhotoGuard creates perturbations in the original input image that are checked against during the inference process, which causes the AI to confuse the two images. This more complex biometric \u201cdiffusion attack\u201d uses significantly more memory than encoding.\n\nIn either case, the process is undetectable in the original image.\n\nWhile the training of facial recognition algorithms is not mentioned in MIT\u2019s release, PhotoGuard would presumably also block this application of AI to online images.\n<h2>Potential and protection in equal measures</h2>\n\u201cThe progress in AI that we are witnessing is truly breathtaking,\u201d says MIT professor Aleksander Madry, who co-authored the PhotoGuard research paper. \u201cBut it enables beneficial and <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/quality-depth-and-scale-of-ai-fraud-poses-greatest-financial-services-threat-in-history\">malicious uses</a> of AI alike. It is thus urgent that we work towards identifying and mitigating the latter.\u201d\n\nThe PhotoGuard team, however, emphasized that truly robust protection against AI will require cooperation and coordination across the sector. Hadi Salman, the graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science and the paper\u2019s lead author, says policymakers should consider <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/everyone-has-an-opinion-about-ai-policies-and-regulations\">regulating</a> safeguards against manipulation, pointing to PhotoGuard as an example.\n\n\u201cCompanies that develop these models need to invest in engineering robust immunizations against the possible threats posed by these AI tools,\u201d he says. \u201cAs we tread into this new era of generative models, let\u2019s strive for potential and protection in equal measures.\u201d", "link": "https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/ai-vs-ai-mit-researchers-combat-image-manipulation", "date_published": "2023-08-24T22:23:02.525263+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/biometricupdate", "title": "Presentation attacks the dominant vector for ID document fraud; ID R&D urges FIDO update", "description": "<img alt=\"selfie biometrics and id document check GOVUK\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://d1sr9z1pdl3mb7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/24132025/selfie-biometrics-and-id-document-check-GOVUK.png\" width=\"960\" />\n\t\tNine out of ten document-based fraud attacks are presentation attacks, according to research from <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/id-rd\">ID R&amp;D</a> that highlights the importance of ID document liveness detection.\n\nThe research is presented in the company\u2019s new 10-page white paper, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.idrnd.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IDR_D_Document-Liveness-Whitepaper-.pdf\">Document Liveness and its Role in Preventing Identity Fraud</a>.\u201d The paper makes the case for the importance of using government-issued identity documents as the anchor for identity verifications, and breaks down fraudulent documents into counterfeits and forgeries. Each document fraud attack type is explained, along with how they can be mitigated.\n\nID R&amp;D argues that most know your customer (KYC) platforms focus on confirming document authenticity, such as by checking the document structure, text and bar codes. Fraud attempts detectable through these means make up only 10 percent of all attacks, however.\n\nDocument presentation attacks include printed copies, screen replays and portrait overlays.

The company maintains that its products aren't facing headwinds alone, that the sector is struggling.\n\nExecutives took two difficult steps during the half that probably feel like gulps of fresh air in a fire right now. It sold off more equity, raising NOK 100.1 million ($9.4 million) but also diluting its stock. Shareholders no doubt were assuaged in part by cost-cutting that included layoffs.\n\nTogether, the moves were designed to slash operating costs in fiscal 2023 by NOK 14 million ($1.3 million) compared to last fiscal year.\n\nThe company managed forward moves during the first half.\n\nZwipe announced its first commercial launches with MasterCard and Visa. It released what executives said is the \"market's first mobile enrolment\" code with a software development kit for card issuers.

This compares to an operating loss of NOK 24.8 million ($2.3 million), or NOK 0.26 ($0.0024), on operating revenue of NOK 20.6 million ($1.9 million).\n\nThe company is boasting about three design wins registered in the first half. In fact, according to the report, the 41 design wins notched since the end of 2019 have \"the potential to make Next profitable.\"\n\nAnd its sensors are now available, through EOD Gear, for use by the U.S. federal government.\n\nContracts were signed independently with two Asian outfits that together could bring in NOK 175 million ($16.4 million) over three years, according to the company.\n\nThe backdrop are delays in developing the FAP20 sensor-chip market in India.

The release says the president is also closely monitoring the implementation of the project, which <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202301/philippines-leader-wants-a-digital-national-id-much-sooner-with-private-sector-help\">he has highlighted the importance of in the past</a>.\n\nAccording to Balisacan, the Department of Information and Communication technology (DICT) will henceforth oversee the issuance of the digital IDs, while the competence for producing and distributing physical PhilID cards stays with the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA).\n\nThe official also gave assurances that the government has already produced more than half the number of PhilIDs applied for, saying it will save a lot of resources when the project shall be completed. The PSA is looking forward to printing 50 million ID cards before the year runs out.\n\nThe move for the DICT to issue digital versions of the PhilID is a recommendation of the Department of Justice (DOJ) to President Marcos Jr. in May, according to <a href=\"https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/08/23/neda-and-dict-sets-new-target-for-issuance-of-digital-national-ids/\">Business Mirror</a>, which mentions that NEDA and DICT are hoping to have all digital versions of the ID available before the end of the year.\n\nThe digital version of the PhilID was not a priority from the beginning, but the NEDA boss says digital ID is becoming increasingly important, as was seen during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.", "link": "https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/philippines-wants-to-issue-more-digital-ids-than-cards-as-president-takes-active-interest", "date_published": "2023-08-24T17:22:53.392310+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/biometricupdate", "title": "Professor wins grant from privacy commish to tackle facial recognition bias in Canada", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://d1sr9z1pdl3mb7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/07111707/black-woman-facial-recognition-scaled.jpg\" width=\"2048\" />\n\t\tDr. Gideon Christian has been awarded a $50,000 grant from Canada\u2019s Office of the Privacy Commissioner Contributions Program for his research project, \"Mitigating Race, Gender and Privacy Impacts of AI Facial Recognition Technology\" to identify issues in the development and deployment of facial recognition in the country, according to an article from the <a href=\"https://www.ucalgary.ca/news/law-professor-explores-racial-bias-implications-facial-recognition-technology\">University of Calgary</a>.\n\n\u201cThere is this false notion that technology, unlike humans, is not biased,\" says Christian, PhD. \u201cThat\u2019s not accurate.
