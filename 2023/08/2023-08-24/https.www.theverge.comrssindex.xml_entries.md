  <p id="AsRc1S">Citizen is temporarily suspending sales of its second-gen CZ Smart watch due to a “technical issue.” The Wear OS watch, which launched in May, had a feature based on tech from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/4/23538710/citizen-cz-smart-wear-os-smartwatch-features-chronotype-ces-2023">IBM’s Watson and NASA</a> to track a person’s alertness.</p>
<p id="UWDovJ">It appears the decision stems from negative experiences from reviewers. Michael Fisher — better known as MrMobile on YouTube — noted that Citizen said it would suspend sales after he had reached out to the company about the watch’s many issues. That was corroborated by a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/citizen-suspends-sale-of-cz-smart-gen-2-wear-os-smartwatch/"><em>Wired</em> story</a>, in which reviewer Julian Chokkattu also detailed several bugs, like laggy screens, bad battery life, inaccurate tracking, and watchfaces that can’t even tell the correct time.</p>

  <p id="xXo4we">Wing, the drone delivery service owned by Alphabet, is teaming up with Walmart to offer deliveries in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. In <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2023/08/24/walmart-and-wing-team-up-to-provide-the-convenience-of-drone-delivery">an announcement on Thursday</a>, Walmart says the partnership will allow the retailer to deliver to an additional 60,000 homes.</p>
<p id="P9ZBkN">In the coming weeks, Wing will start delivering out of a Walmart Supercenter in Frisco, Texas, before expanding to a second nearby store by the end of this year. The company will make deliveries to homes within six miles of the stores, with deliveries arriving “in under 30 minutes.” Even though <a href="https://blog.wing.com/2023/08/wing-walmart-partner.html">Wing says</a> the drones are “highly automated,” operators will still keep an eye on them from a remote location.</p>

  <p id="mG9XnZ">When was the last time you cleaned your smartwatch? These are devices you wear 24/7, and if you took off your watch right now, there’s a good chance you’d find dead skin, sweat, oil, and grime all over it. A gunky sensor array isn’t the best for health tracking, and crusty charging contacts are also less than ideal. If you’ve experienced any skin irritation or smelled something funky — this may be why.</p>
<p id="OqBFCm">Plus, I hate to break it to you, but your straps are also filthier than you think. A <a href="https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=125218">recent study</a> found that nearly 95 percent of smartwatch wristbands contained high levels of bacteria, including Staphylococcus, E.coli, and Pseudomonas — particularly on porous materials like rubber, plastic, and fabric. </p>

  <p id="gIpAEQ">Google is testing a new YouTube feature that lets you hum or record a song to search for it.</p>
<p id="YP876u">If you’re part of the YouTube experiment for the feature, you can hum or record three or more seconds of a song so that Google can try to identify it, <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/18138167">according to a support page</a>.  Once YouTube identifies the song, it will show you relevant content about that song. Basically, it’s a Google-y take on Shazam, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/11/16761984/apple-shazam-acquisition">which is owned by Apple</a>.</p>
<p id="4AR1X4">Not everyone will have access to the experiment at first, though. Google says it’s rolling out to “a small percentage of people across the globe who watch YouTube on Android devices.”</p>

Cherry, the German manufacturer behind the ubiquitous Cherry MX, has announced a redesigned version of the switch <a href="https://www.cherrymx.de/en/mx2a.html">called the Cherry MX2A</a> that it says should feel smoother to press, sound quieter, and still be rated to survive millions of actuations.

<p id="3apWfw">The announcement of the Cherry MX2A comes after years of keyboard enthusiasts learning how to modify Cherry’s switches to overcome their perceived shortcomings. Depending on who you ask, Cherry’s switches have too much wobble, feel scratchy to press, and don’t sound as good as some of their competitors....</p>

  <p id="tK7JD5">It’s that time again: Epic Games is launching another major season of <em>Fortnite</em> on Friday, and a day ahead of the start of the season, the company debuted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_DReaOoEjM">a cinematic trailer</a> that hints at some of what you can expect. </p>
<p id="ZMFZLQ">A big feature of this season appears to be heists. The trailer shows a band of <em>Fortnite</em> characters sneaking into an elaborate building, disabling laser traps, and tossing a suitcase that turns into a gun. (<em>Fortnite</em> has done <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/4/17818500/fortnite-high-stakes-getaway-grappler-weapon">heists</a> / <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21144437/fortnite-chapter-2-season-2-secret-agents-items-characters-modes">secret agent</a> themes before, and I’m curious what this new season will bring.) It also appears players will also have to contend with a vampire named Kado Thorne — hopefully he factors heavily into whatever Epic has up its sleeve for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/18/23409543/fortnite-halloween-fortnitemares-update-werewolf-epic-games">the next Fortnitemares event</a>.</p>

If a team finds itself in a late-game drive with everything on the line, you might see a graphic telling you whether the team should go for it on fourth down. When the quarterback snaps the ball, the broadcast might automatically highlight the most open receivers down the field. And as the team marches down the field, you might see lines on the field not just showing a kicker’s field goal range but the exact spot from which he’s more than 50 percent likely to nail the game-winner.</p>

The now Sony-owned studio hyped up <em>Lightfall </em>as the beginning stages of the biggest light vs. darkness battle we’ve ever seen. “The battle begins here and now,” said Commander Zavala in an epic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-7Cq7LLPr4">launch trailer</a>. The in-game reality felt, for many, like the story writing was lackluster. Even six months on, <em>Lightfall </em>has mostly negative reviews on Steam, a sign that fans were expecting more.</p>
<p id="h6Lfmt">There’s now a lot riding on <em>The Final Shape</em>, the upcoming <em>Destiny 2</em> expansion that’s set to conclude the light and darkness saga of <em>Destiny </em>in February — a story that’s been told for nearly 10 years now. But with unease in the <em>Destiny </em>community, how is <em>The Final Shape</em> going to draw unhappy or lapsed players...</p>

  <p id="GXDu88">Ford’s making a special new factory matte black Platinum Black edition of its all-electric F-150 Lightning truck. Revealed today, this Lightning looks like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/5/14/3018909/batmobile-on-tour">Batman’s Tumbler</a> Batmobile from <em>The Dark Knight</em> trilogy, with some glossy finish remaining on the door handles, roof, and elsewhere. Ford spokesperson Susannah Evans tells <em>The Verge</em> that under the factory wrap, the vehicle is finished with Ford’s glossy agate black paint.</p>
<p id="Op8NSO">Ford will only make 2,000 of these murdered-out pickups that start at $97,995, which is about $6,000 more than the regular Platinum tier and roughly the same as the price before Ford <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/17/23797364/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-truck-price-drop">dropped prices on the truck in July</a>. </p>
