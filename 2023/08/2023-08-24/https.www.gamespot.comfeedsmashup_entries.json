Discovery announced today that the sci-fi epic is shifting into the next calendar year, and pushing back another film as a result, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2023/film/news/dune-2-delayed-2024-strikes-1235703991/\">Variety</a> reports.</p><p>Dune: Part Two will now hit theaters on March 15, 2024, just over four months later than its previous date of November 3, 2023. As part of the shift, Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire is being delayed from March 14 to April 12. Both films were co-produced by Legendary Entertainment and Warner Bros., so Variety notes that the two parties had to agree on a new release date for this to happen.</p><p>The delay of Dune: Part Two was only confirmed by Warner Bros. today, but has been expected for some time. The strikes of the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and the Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA) continue, meaning that actors and writers are not allowed to promote upcoming films or work on new material. For both of those reasons, it seems likely that more movies will be delayed into next year. Studios will be looking to stretch out the completed content they have to keep money moving during the strike, while also hoping that the strike will end before these new release dates so that the films' stars can promote the material.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warner-bros-delays-dune-part-2-to-march-2024/1100-6517206/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at

You can join minds with NPC Priest Entity Nada to investigate and befriend the mysterious robots. As you do, you'll build out a new Volaic Staff multitool, combining multiple components together. You can find hidden Autophage monuments and settlements across worlds. As you complete missions with the Autophage, you will gain reputation and win honorary titles, as well as robotic customization parts to change your avatar.</p><p>Pirates now have capital ships, which you can attack or raid. You can even fly directly into their superstructure, Star Wars style. Capital ships generally, no matter which faction they belong to, can be reduced to stardust. A new Combat HUD will show the hull integrity of large ships. Along with the additional enemies, starship combat has been revamped to allow power allocation.

And while that attraction--Villain-Con: Minion Blast--may be primarily appealing to younger visitors and families, it's also a clear indicator of what Universal believes is the future of its theme parks. It's not enough to simply have an arsenal of rides that cast visitors into the role of passive passengers. Now, Universal wants guests to become the star of their own story.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">It all started when Universal Studios launched its first Wizarding World of Harry Potter expansion at Universal's Islands of Adventure in 2010. Instead of traveling through the land en route to a ride or gift shop, Islands of Adventure's Hogsmeade brought the Wizarding World franchise to life in a new way, as in-character performers dotted the beautifully crafted recreation of the small town where Harry and his friends went to school.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Disney followed suit with <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-galaxys-edge-a-guide-to-disneys-new-them/1100-6467294/\">Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge</a> in 2019, letting guests go on their own adventures on a newly revealed planet in the Star Wars galaxy. However, in the lead-up to the debut of that land at both Disneyland Resort and Walt Disney World, the company shared big and bold ideas of a themed land that was alive and thriving. Unfortunately, many of those ideas never made it past that initial stage. The land wasn't humming with excitement or filled with familiar Star Wars characters. What's more, the promise of your reputation following you around the land based on how well you scored in the Millennium Falcon: Smuggler's Run ride simply never happened.</p><a
