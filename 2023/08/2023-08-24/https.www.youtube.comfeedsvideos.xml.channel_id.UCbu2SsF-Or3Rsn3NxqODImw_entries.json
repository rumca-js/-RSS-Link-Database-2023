That's once again the broad strokes of this latest space thriller, Fort Solis, but the intrigue, as ever, is in the details. Developer Fallen Leaf does a good job of hiding the satisfying answers to its central mysteries up to the very end, which makes its story consistently absorbing even as some of its gameplay elements betray its own Hollywood-inspired intentions.\n\nFort Solis is a third-person adventure game that tells a story reminiscent of Moon and 2001: A Space Odyssey. It's slow, sometimes to a fault, and more concerned with its message and themes than action set-pieces. That doesn't mean it's a low-stakes tale. On the contrary, the secrets tucked away in Fort Solis are existential, but it's expressed through the eyes of a small cast of interesting characters whom you'll get to know over the game's five-hour story.\n\n#gaming #fortsolis #gamespot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBw4ajuoOJA", "date_published": "2023-08-24T23:43:10.674032+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/vBw4ajuoOJA/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon Review", "description": "Armored Core 6 sees From Software return to and refine its roots with a game of thrilling mech combat built on aggression, agility, and customization.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_zyghuTAXI", "date_published": "2023-08-24T22:03:11.733133+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/x_zyghuTAXI/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Warhammer: Age of Sigmar: Realms of Ruin Hands On Impressions | Gamescom 2023", "description": "Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Realms of Ruin is throwing around plenty of Warhammer pedigree. It's the first RTS title in the Age of Sigmar setting and arguably the largest game to touch upon Games Workshop\u2019s re-imagined fantasy realms, as well as being co-written by Gav Thorpe of Black Library fame.\n\nI\u2019ve played Realms of Ruin a few times now and at first I was struck by how similar the gameplay was to Warhammer: 40,000 Dawn of War, but as the game\u2019s development has progressed, more and more of what makes Realm of Ruin unique and interesting has bubbled up to the surface. \n\nNow that the third faction has been announced, and we\u2019ve seen a little of the Nighthaunts in action, the unique strengths and weaknesses of each side is a little more clear, something that has also been helped by a healthy dose of balancing since the Realm of Ruin\u2019s previous beta.\n\nThe Stormcast Eternals play much more into their survivalist, tanky, tough staying power playstyle, Orruk Kruleboys\u2019 have more utility and strategy from their traps and beasts, while the Nighthaunt seem to be relying on pure strength in numbers and wraths and ghostly beings surround your troops.\u00a0\n\nThe Nighthaunts also bring a new flavor to the game\u2019s roster, and I must admit as a Warhammer fan I often find it hard when previewing games like these to appreciate the bigger picture of what I\u2019m playing as I zoom the camera into each model as close as possible to inspect their details.\u00a0\n\nOne thing I do still struggle with though is unit identification, especially where these ghostly folks are considered. Some of that is addressed by the icons present above a unit's head signifying what type of unit they are and where they are positioned in the broad \u201crock-paper-scissors\u201d style of army building, where units of a certain type are better suited to take on others.\n\nThe special abilities of units remain as one of the most satisfying elements of Realms of Ruin. Pinning down your enemies with shielded, unbreakable Liberators and charging in from the sides with your Vanguard Hunters or using winged prosecutors to throw hammers from above is exceptionally effective should you be able to pull it off.\n\nHowever, as each unit has their own ability (some with multiple), and you also need to keep an eye on unit health and be ready to hit that \u201cretreat\u201d button, the moving parts of Realm of Ruin were putting my micromanagement abilities to the test.\n\nI was also able to try out Realms of Ruin\u2019s Direct Step control scheme for the first time, Frontier\u2019s development in the world of RTS user experience for those who favor a gamepad.\u00a0\nOrders are issued by drawing paths and waypoints from position to position, and instead of having to scroll between what unit you want you are instead able to use the left joystick to jump to the unit you\u2019re pointing at.\n\nI\u2019ll admit I wasn\u2019t sold on it at first, it doesn\u2019t really control quite like anything else I\u2019ve played, but after a very short while I started to see the appeal as my actions and orders became much smoother, and I was more confidently using the sticks and face buttons to group units, reinforce my army and utilize abilities. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d pick this control scheme over a keyboard and mouse, but as Warhammer: Age of Sigmar: Realms of Ruin is also coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, I\u2019m glad to say that Direct Step could be the best way to play an RTS on console.\n\nWe also got a small look at the new Conquest game mode, a repeatable single player experience where you fight across the map in a procedurally generated route, with many battles having \u201crule breaking\u201d modifiers such as extreme fog of war, or just a single capture point for parties to fight over, with a final score growing depending on how many battles you are able to survive through. For those of us who don\u2019t fancy our chances playing online, but want a little more than single player skirmishes against the AI, it\u2019s nice to see that the longevity of the single player experience has been considered.\u00a0\n\nWarhammer: Age of Sigmar - Realms of Ruin feels like an exciting next step in what an RTS can offer to a broader audience, and what the genre can be on console. I\u2019m happy to see that rich campaigns and stories have a place in RTS games, and I have no doubt other Warhammer fans will be overjoyed to see more of their favorite stories and miniatures brought to life when the game releases on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on November 17th.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_BhXxNCXFE", "date_published": "2023-08-24T21:23:10.979614+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/0_BhXxNCXFE/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Mortal Kombat 1 Rain Gameplay Breakdown", "description": "On today's Queen's Court Kombat Kast Tyler and Stephanie breakdown Rain in Mortal Kombat 1.
