<p>We got a peak at the professor's styling and profiling when he was a guest on our GOP Debate Livestream. That, by the way, was the largest on the internet outside of only Rumble showing the actual debate. But to truly appreciate that Peterson drip in the proper lighting, here he is responding to the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jordan-peterson-ordered-by-canadian-court" target="_blank">Canadian government ordering him to social media reeducation</a>.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>I can't confirm this is 100% where this piece of haberdashery came from, but it reminded me of my favorite story from the beginning of the year. I had seen a link to a video about Jordan Peterson's Twitter suit. I assumed he meant a lawsuit and was surprised to hear he would do Elon Musk like that. But Peterson had <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jordan-peterson-rather-die-twitter" target="_self">multiple issues</a> with <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jordan-peterson-twitter-elliot-page" target="_self">the bird app</a> last year. I'm sure JP had his reasons. I doubt Elon would take it personally.</p><p>No, he meant an actual suit inspired by Twitter. It has an Elon Musk tie and everything.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rumble">

</p>
<p>There is a custom suit company that made Peterson twelve suits for each of his 12 Rules for Life. As if that isn't awesome enough, when asked if he wanted a Twitter suit, Peterson responded "Well, NOW I do." </p><p>The Elon Musk tie got the bulk of the attention, but for me, it's the lining made up of Twitter comments that scream "Drip Gawd."</p><p>I don't know if the debate suit is from the debate is part of the 12 Rules Collection, or which of the 12 Rules it represents. If I were to guess, "make friends with people who want the best for you." But what I'm here for is, as intentional as it may be, Jordan Peterson walking around looking like a based Doctor Who.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="7b309" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=35081219&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>No. I need this as a TV show now. And deep down, you know that you do too.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>Jordan Peterson as the Based Doctor. There has already been a War Doctor that broke from the numerical sequence. Plus the last showrunner threw out the source material altogether to retcon everything in his image. it's not like there isn't precedence.</p><p>Jordan Peterson. In a time machine. With a companion or two. Traveling all throughout space and time. Fighting his archenemies the Dalek. The Dalek mantras of "I was bred to receive orders," "purify the Earth," and "you will obey the Daleks or you will be exterminated" sound like the woke twats who have panic attacks whenever they hear someone listening to a Peterson podcast in the college cafeteria.  The Based Doctor battling them wouldn't be much of a stretch.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Taco Bell sells out to globalism, pledges to support digital currency and go cashless

<img src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=35080413&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0" /><br /><br /><p> <strong><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/2024-gop-candidates" target="_self"><em>VOTE IN THE LWC 2024 GOP STRAW POLL! CLICK HERE!</em></a></strong></p><p>This one is a shot right to the gut. A gut that is carrying an extra thirty pounds because of an affection for Cheesy Gordita Crunches. Taco Bell is selling out to globalists and wants to go 100% cashless. They claim they have different reasons, but I know that you know that I know that you know where and why digital currency became a thing, and by who.</p><p>Chris Turner, CFO of Yum! Brands (the corporation that owns the Bell) made the announcement on a recent earnings call:</p><blockquote>Aside from making it easier for customers...</blockquote><p>Excuse me.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="10b08" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=35080488&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>OK, continue.</p><blockquote>...to complete impulse transactions at the click of a button, there are other reasons for Taco Bell’s switch to an all-digital operation. Going cashless and making customers order through screens rather than with the assistance of a human being means that Taco Bell can use its technology to suggest additional items to supplement one’s order. Yup, the good old-fashioned upsell, modernized for the digital age.</blockquote><p>It makes sense to an extent, from a shareholder standpoint. But there are two things that need to be considered both from a customer experience standpoint as well as a Taco Bell's survival standpoint.</p><p>First, I'm going to ask you to watch this video. Only instead of strawberries, it's a Crunchwrap Supreme. And instead of an old man, it's a dude in his mid-20s, it's late at night, and he is b-b-b-barbequed out of his mind. Think Koe Wetzel looking for someone sober enough to take him to Taco Bell.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

        <a href="https://twitter.com/CatchUpFeed/status/1685995139804639234"></a>
</blockquote>
<p>The second is to know the types of people who are pushing digital currency in the first place. The Associated Press has issued a "fact" "check" claiming a video showing an elitist telling you the coming digital cashless society will be regulated and undesirable purchases will be controlled <a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-world-economic-forum-cashless-society-false-cbdc-592718364311" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">is misleading and out of context</a>. They also claimed Democrats didn't want to ban gas stoves. The fact that these words are even being said out loud is the problem.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

        <a href="https://twitter.com/Raymond82310289/status/1677217424842653696"></a>
</blockquote>
<p>Is the Left saying verbatim "We are going to use digital currency to control what you are allowed to buy?" No. Would any of you put it past them? Also no. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="09bae" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=35080586&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>And one area where they made it clear they want to control your behavior IS TO STOP YOU EATING MEAT.</p><p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/genetically-modified-stop-eating-meat" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self" title="view post: Watch: Resurfaced clip shows &quot;bioethicist&quot; call for humans to be genetically modified to stop eating meat">Watch: Resurfaced clip shows "bioethicist" call for humans to be genetically modified to stop eating meat</a></p><p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/meat-city-advertising-ban" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self" title="view post: City becomes first to ban meat advertisements to better control your behavior">City becomes first to ban meat advertisements to better control your behavior</a></p><p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/economist-calls-for-beef-to-be-regulated" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self" title="view post: &quot;Did a cow write this?&quot;: Left-wing mag demands you eat Tofu instead of delicious steak (for the usual reasons)">"Did a cow write this?": Left-wing mag demands you eat Tofu instead of delicious steak (for the usual reasons)</a></p><p>Taco Bell is going to stop you from buying their delicious food using cash in favor of having you app'ing it. When the government comes along and then prevents anyone using digital currency from buying meat (because you know the corporations would sell you out in a heartbeat), then what? </p><p>The company either goes out of business because they've given away any alternative ways of exchanging money for goods. Or they switch to meat substitutes and would go out of business because you can all eat a dick with your meat substitutes.</p><p>People need to start opening more locally-owned taco shacks and allow we the people (and the hungry) an alternative and an excuse to tell greedy corporations where they can stick their agenda. The future of Taco Tuesday in America depends on it.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Government orders Jordan Peterson to undergo re-education and he's hitting back HARD

CLICK HERE!</em></a></strong></p><p>In a move that seems batsh*t crazy even by Canadian standards -- remember, this is a country that <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/justin-trudeau-emergencies-act" target="_blank">suspended civil liberites because protesters were making Justin Trudeau look bad</a> -- a court has ordered Jordan Peterson to be reeducated and pay a $25,000 fine. All because a handful of people, some of whom not even Canadian, didn't like his tweets.</p><p>Peterson, as I'm sure you can guess, is ordering the Canadian court to reeducate deez nuts. Only in a more, Peterson-esque way.</p><p><br /></p><h3>What happened between Jordan Peterson and Ontario College</h3><br /><img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="15329" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=35078949&amp;width=980" /><p>In January, Peterson was informed that OCP was demanding <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jordan-peterson-college-psycology" target="_blank">he submit himself to mandatory social-media communication retraining</a>. If not, he would face an in-person tribunal and suspension of his right to operate as a licensed clinical psychologist.</p><p>About a dozen people complained that, because of comments he made during a four-hour-long Joe Rogan podcast, he should not be allowed to practice psychology in Canada. Even though not every one of the dozen was from Canada.</p><p>Peterson released the full complaint, and it read like a list of <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jordan-peterson-releases-complaint" target="_blank">101 Reasons Why We Love Jordan Peterson on Twitter</a>. Twelve global people and the OCP disagreed.</p><p>The professor said at the time <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jordan-peterson-ontario-college-educate" target="_blank">of any attempt to "retrain" him</a>: "<em>Someone said I should just record it and put it online. I don't know I'd like to put any educator through the horrible process of having to come and try to re-educate me either. Because I can't see how that would go particularly well for them. I'm not sure who would end up re-education in a situation like that."</em></p><h3>How is Peterson responding?</h3><br /><img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="dec4d" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=35079006&amp;width=980" /><p>
	The decision came down on Wednesday that sided with the <a href="https://redstate.com/wardclark/2023/08/23/jordan-peterson-ordered-to-undergo-re-education-n2162968#google_vignette" target="_blank">College of Psychologists of Ontario</a>.
</p><blockquote>
	Justice Paul Schabas wrote that the college's order that Peterson undergo a program on professionalism in public statements balanced its mandate to regulate the profession, "is not disciplinary and does not prevent Dr. Peterson from expressing himself on controversial topics."<br />
<br />
	Citing a clear and transparent review process from the college, previous warnings it had made to Peterson about his language and his "unwillingness to acknowledge the (complaints committee's) concerns," Schabas dismissed the judicial review application and ordered Peterson to pay the college $25,000.</blockquote><p>
	This means the government ruled, that because twelve people don't like Jordan Peterson, he needs to be reeducated on how to "properly" use social media, and pay the college 25 grand for their pain and suffering. Over tweets and JP hanging out with Rogan.
</p><p>
	Peterson dropped X on the matter and is telling the college and the Canadian government to bring it on.
</p><div class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" style="display: flex; width: 100%; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"></div> <p class="">Peterson responding will make things entertaining. But this also needs to get filed under Pay Attention, America. Canada gets away with this because they don't have a First Amendment or free speech rights. We do. For now. Don't think for one minute (which is 1:36 Canadian) that Leftists in this country aren't gazing at Canada with goo-goo ideas and counting the days when they can do the same here.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Vivek Ramaswamy vs. Nikki Haley was a highlight of the GOP Debate and we NEED a 1-on-1 foreign policy debate

If there are more than three people on stage and they agree on 90% of the topics, it's not a debate. It's a glorified joint press conference. Raise your hand if you support cheese, and ZOMG did [candidate A] hear what [candidate B] said about you on social media?!</p><p>Now that platforms like Rumble are decimating the cable news industry, we don't need these joint press conferences anymore. We can have one-on-one debates anywhere in America at any time. All we need is an internet connection and a dispute. That's why I want to see a full 1-on-1 debate between Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy on foreign policy.</p><p>One that is serious and sober on their two conflicting ideologies. And not just screaming over each other. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Me personally? I have a hard time wrapping my head around foreign policy other than smug European countries need to start picking up their portion of defense spending. Overall, there seem to be a lot of sh*tty choices and at any given time we have to decide on which is the less sh*tty. This is why I blog and don't run for president. </p><p>And I know not everyone wants to hear this, but there are still an above-average amount of primary voters who skew in Haley's direction more than Vivek's. She got cheered and he got booed last night by the audience more than any of us olnine would expect.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>
<p>So instead of five minutes of cheap content, let's get a FULL HOUR between two candidates who represent polar opposite philosophies in the Republican party.  Vivek says we are giving too much to Ukraine. Haley says we are not giving enough. Give each candidate ample time to show their work and challenge the other person.</p><p>Let's hear someone who has foreign policy experience (Haley was Donald Trump's Ambassador to the UN) versus an outsider who sees what's not working and thinks we should tackle it another way. There are a ton of voters who go back and forth depending on the specific issue. Convince them you're right.</p><p>And convince voters WHY you're running for president. Haley's entire campaign so far has been "Hey, maybe I'll get lucky in the state I was a governor." And it feels more and more like Vivek is running to become a MAGA celebrity. He called Trump the greatest president of the 21st century. Great... so why are you running against him?<br /></p><p>Let's see Vivek vs. Haley on foreign policy. Let's see a governor vs. a senator/vice president on draining the swamp. 2024 is the most important election of our lifetime. We need to treat the primary as if it is. That means getting off of the tired and failed cable TV model.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

<p>It is going to be a long seventeenth months.

I've already declared myself all-in for Ron DeSantis, who I think did great. I wasn't as enamored by Vivek Ramaswamy as <a href="https://twitter.com/LWCnewswire/status/1694657711944671569" target="_blank">74% of you who read this website</a>. And I stand by my preview of the debate about nothing moving the polls significantly other than the RESULTS of the Iowa Caucus. But the question and answer on viral sensation Oliver Anthony stood out as the one thing all of us need to focus on.</p><p>Here's a little LWC BTS. I so knew Fox News would be hack enough to bring up Anthony, I pitched a last-minute addition to last night's drinking game "chug every time <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/oliver-anthony-youtube" target="_blank">Oliver Anthony</a> gets mentioned." I was NOT expecting it to be <a href="https://www.whiskeyriff.com/2023/08/23/the-first-question-at-the-gop-presidential-debate-was-about-oliver-anthonys-rich-men-north-of-richmond/" target="_blank">the first question of the debate</a>: “Governor DeSantis, why is this song striking such a nerve in this country right now? What do you think it means?”</p><p>DeSantis knocked it out of the park. “We cannot succeed as a country if you are working hard and you can’t afford groceries, a car, or a new home while Hunter Biden can make hundreds of thousands of dollars on lousy paintings. That is wrong. We also cannot succeed when the Congress spends trillions and trillions of dollars. Those rich men north of Richmond have put us in this situation.”</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>This will be the only clip to go viral outside of very online right-wing X (we can smell our own) since Anthony himself has gone viral outside of our bubble. He DEBUTED at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts ahead of Taylor Swift and Oliva Rodrigo. You don't do that because online conservatives want to own the libs. You do that because you touched a nerve with the vast apolitical center. The middle-class men South of Richmond, North of Annapolis, and West of Alexandria.</p><p>The apolitical people in the middle, the ones too busy being outside touching grass rather than being very online, are the ones who decide elections. With most national elections you have 40% conservative, 40% leftists, and 20% in the middle that move from cycle to cycle. That 20% has found a spiritual connection with Oliver Anthony in a way no other current artists have. </p><p>We need a candidate who connects the dots and talks to and ABOUT that 20% (as opposed to talking about himself and how unfair his life is). Primary voters have the rest of 2023 to think long and hard about who that is).</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
