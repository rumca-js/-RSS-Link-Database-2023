## Hollywood writer shares pitch for big-budget action movie using nothing but NERF guns and it sounds amazing

But Van Robichaux (<em>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</em>) shared his pitch for a big-budget live-action movie that, while we here at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website aren't ones by hyperbole, sounds like the greatest movie we've ever heard. (shout out <a href="https://twitchy.com/aaronwalker/2023/08/18/a-brooklyn-nine-nine-writer-shares-his-vision-for-a-nerf-gun-movie-and-were-here-for-it-n2386416#google_vignette" target="_blank">Twitchy</a>)</p><p>Van dropped X after reading Hasbro is launching an entertainment division to milk their IPs for every dollar they can get. Van's idea? "Get a Rock, a Hemsworth any big action stars. Hire a great action director & do a normal action movie but—every weapon’s a Nerf weapon. Every bullet is foam. Never directly address it in the film & play it all straight."</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>If you needed a better example of how out of touch Hollywood is, no one was into it. "Development execs seem wired to not get big ideas. On this, I think they had issues w/ specific character arcs (which…who cares you fix that in the script) & a baffling concern of not “having stakes” w/o bullets. I got shut down before anyone with real authority got to hear it."</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

The way <em>Team America</em> came about is that <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/south-park-excclusive-variant" target="_blank">Matt Stone and Trey Parker</a> came across the most ridiculous, over-the-top, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7ssUivM-eM" target="_blank">MICHAEL BAY BOOM-esque</a> script they've ever seen. They wanted to make it shot for shot, only with marionettes.

<p>Hollywood cares most about the Chinese market. But if they decide to care about the middle America market, they will make this film. There are few things more suburban than entire families getting into huge Nerf wars with each other. I have an entire arsenal in my basement, as does my brother-in-law and his neighbors. Whenever we get together with the kids...</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>I also have a collection of styrofoam swords. It's important to make sure our young ones diversify their fighting styles.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of Americans all across America have the exact same experiences. Full-on Nerf wars where only a few survive. Put that in the movie and you might as well be printing money.</p><p>Get The Rock's, Jason Statham's, and Liam Neeson's agents on the phone. Get Denzel. This NEEDS to be made.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## "Egg producer" Megyn Kelly under fire for Rachel Levine attack, her five-word response proves she's not backing down

She got into it with Assistant Health Secretary Admiral Rachel Levine. You remember Rachel, right? She's the dude people were getting kicked off Twitter for calling a dude when the White House had a direct line to Twitter executives.</p><p>At issue is the term "egg producers," which Levine used to identify who used to be known as "women." It's worth pointing out that before becoming a woman himself, Levine was married to an egg producer who produced two beautiful full-grown embryos.</p><p>Kelly took offense. "This is Joe Biden’s rep (a man posing as a woman — and not convincingly) endorsing the idea of scrubbing the term “women” for “egg producers.” So jealous he can’t be female he wants to erase those of us who are.

<p>It's odd how all the "inclusive" language that transgenders and transgender sympathizers demand is directed toward only women.

Now, "egg producer." I've yet to hear guys being labeled "semen sprinklers" or anything like that. Just saying.</p><p>Benjamin Ryan, a semen sprinkler who creates content for the New York Times, was aghast that Kelly would speak about a Biden Administration official in such a dismissive matter.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Megyn Kelly is <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/megyn-kelly-daily-beast" target="_blank">not one for suffering fools</a>. She isn't suffering this fool or the foolishness of Rachel Levine's jealousy she can never produce eggs himself. When it comes to the issue of semen sprinklers who want to be egg producers, Kelly believes in three things: science, biology, and her functioning eyes.</p><p>If anyone was expecting her to back down, nope: "Correct, and will continue to."</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Kelly is sending a message to all egg producers, chest feeders, and birthing people that they don't have to take this nonsense from the Biden Administration. The Left can only delete women if women let them.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

<p>I believe this is what the TikTokers call a "duet." You take someone else's video and place it side by side with you reacting to the video. But Gaines didn't even react.

<p>Gaines isn't known to shy away from controversy. She even revels in starting it. Back in April, she recklessly caused <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/riley-gaines-assaulted-speech" target="_blank">an angry mob to attempt to kill her</a> by the way she insisted on giving a speech and expressing opinions they disagreed with. </p><p>The former NCAA swimmer also refuses to find common ground. When a school official told Gaines they found a compromise in letting boys use the girls' locker room by declaring it no longer a girls' locker room, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/riley-gaines-congressional-hearing" target="_blank">Gaines ran to a Congressional committee to complain</a>.</p><p>Riley Gaines stubbornly insists on her pushing beliefs in science, biology, and common sense on the internet no matter who is hurt by them. But I think we can all admit that yeeting someone's content for eating cereal is kinda silly.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
