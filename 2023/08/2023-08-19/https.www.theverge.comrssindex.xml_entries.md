<p id="PLRjkI">Thaler had tried multiple times to copyright the image “as a work-for-hire to the owner of the Creativity Machine,” which would have listed the author as the creator of the work and Thaler as the artwork’s owner, but he was repeatedly rejected. </p>

  <p id="xR7ORB">Tesla owners with iPhones <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tesla/id582007913">can now use Siri</a> to trigger Apple Shortcuts automations without turning to paid <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tessie-for-your-tesla/id1496718223#?platform=iphone">third-party apps like Tessie</a> to do so. The Tesla app’s newest update, version 4.24.0, dropped with a release note saying “Access your vehicle controls and climate from the Apple Shortcuts app.” </p>
<p id="EtPt19">To use Siri with Shortcuts, all you have to do is invoke Apple’s digital assistant and say the name of your automation. It’s a little clunkier than actual Siri integration, because to trigger  Shortcuts automations, you have to memorize the names you’ve given them and repeat them verbatim, but it’s probably the best Tesla owners will get, at least for now.</p>

A post on the Madden subreddit says that, during games, the audio is cutting out on half their soundbar, then returning with some static, seemingly happening whenever a play ends and a cutscene shows.</p>
<p id="8pbJJw">Our own Nilay Patel says he’s having the same issue on his PS5 through a Dolby Atmos rig, even when he switches the output to just stereo. Throughout the Reddit post, other users say they hear loud popping sounds <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Madden/comments/15siwyv/ps5_m24_audio_bug/jwltu8v/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">every few seconds</a> or when they pause the game.
