<ul><li>Wales 16-52 South Africa</li><li>Springboks run in eight tries in World Cup warmup match</li></ul><p>So that’s what happens when you pit the world champions and their behemoths against an inexperienced Welsh side filled with players from the fringe. Warren Gatland names his World Cup squad on Monday and selected this match-day 23 in the hope that a few lesser-known names would put their hand up. After an eight-try pummelling, this felt like asking a young boxer to cut his teeth against Mike Tyson in his prime.</p><p>South Africa were bigger, stronger, faster and more ruthlessly efficient than their hosts. They monstered the breakdown and clattered anyone in red who had the misfortune of getting near them. The Springboks now move ahead of France into third on World Rugby’s rankings and if anyone needed evidence of the chasm that exists between the top teams and the rest, this was it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/19/wales-south-africa-rugby-union-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With defence spending booming, China onside and murky deals filling gaps left by sanctions, the Kremlin believes it can weather a damaged rouble, but will Russians stomach welfare cuts if they come?</p><p>• <a href="https://composer.gutools.co.uk/content/64df668a8f08af8aaccef491">The ‘dark fleet’ delivering Russia’s oil</a></p><p>As the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/aug/16/putin-meeting-capital-controls-rouble-report" title="">Kremlin took urgent measures to stabilise the plummeting rouble</a> last week, one thing became clear: rampant spending on its war machine and social welfare programmes could not go on for ever. Few observers believe the Russian economy is in danger of imminent collapse. But it has reached a point, they say, where the Kremlin may have to weigh the cost of spending trillions of roubles on its war with Ukraine, and withstanding unprecedented sanctions, while maintaining prewar levels of public spending.</p><p>“In the grand scheme of things, as long as Russia continues to spend so madly – both war spending and on expensive imports – the rouble is not going to improve fundamentally,” said Alexey Eremenko, associate director at consultancy Control Risks. “There’s a structural issue underlying it all … A good question is whether we are at the point yet where the Kremlin has to seriously slash war spending or accept serious damage to the public welfare.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/aug/19/putin-sets-sights-on-re-election-but-cost-of-war-can-only-grow">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The golden boy of rugby became the battered face of a code in crisis but the hope he embodied in so many for so long will endure</p><p>Sometimes he only appeared as a golden blur – burrowing low into contact, pilfering enemy ball from a pile of fallen players, burying a bigger man in a driving tackle. Then he would burst into view, breaking the line and bringing the crowd to their feet, bobbing up in support of a teammate, or peeling off a tangle of limbs to lunge across the line and score.</p><p>Typically where he most needed to be, whether that was as the last line of defence when all ranks were broken or a bolt of inspiration when only confusion and chaos reigned. Too often it has been fronting the public after another disappointing defeat, confronting dark truths front on. That’s when we truly saw him, looking rugby fans in the eyes, vowing to do better.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/20/michael-hoopers-wallabies-career-appears-over-it-will-hurt-to-farewell-him">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As the Venice film festival turns 80, we pick the titles that capture the city’s allure, from desolate Don’t Look Now to romantic Summertime and Top Hat’s cheery glamour</p><p>This time next week I’ll be packing my bags for Venice, where the 80th edition of its annual <a href="https://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/2023">film festival</a> will unveil new films by Sofia Coppola, Ava DuVernay, Yorgos Lanthimos, David Fincher, Ryusuke Hamaguchi, Bradley Cooper, the late William Friedkin – an especially glistening lineup for an event never short on gloss. But even without such attractions, Venice would remain my favourite festival: it’s the faintly unreal allure of the city itself, the spray from the Vaporetto as you leave the airport, the sense that you’re arriving into an eternal film location rather than just an industry event.</p><p>You can’t arrive on the Lido, the drowsy barrier island where the festival unfolds, and not recall the yearning melancholy and faded finery of Luchino Visconti’s <strong><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/death-in-venice">Death in Venice</a></strong> – that the Grand Hotel des Bains, where Dirk Bogarde’s wilting composer Gustav von Aschenbach saw out his days, has been unoccupied since 2010 underlines the isle’s ghostly air of glamour. Although Visconti’s film is set in summer, you’d be forgiven for remembering otherwise. It’s Nicolas Roeg’s devasted, desolately wintry <strong><a href="https://www.itv.com/watch/dont-look-now/23012">Don’t Look Now</a></strong> (ITVX), of course, that best captures Venice in its off-season. Its misty, depopulated maze of alleys and canals laden with threat match the mindset of Donald Sutherland’s grief-stricken parent.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/19/streaming-the-best-films-set-in-venice">Continue reading...</a>
