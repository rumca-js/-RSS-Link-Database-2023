<p>A lower price cap will still mean unaffordable bills for many. Yet a fairer alternative has been quietly dropped</p><p>Nearly a decade ago, former Labour leader Ed Miliband sowed the seeds of the energy price cap, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/13/ed-miliband-energy-firms-price-cut-powers-ofgem-labour-freeze-bills" title="">vowing to protect households from unfair tariffs by freezing their energy bills</a>. But even though a cap has been in place since 2018, bills today can be far from affordable, even when they are fair.</p><p>On Friday, industry regulator Ofgem will set its new limit on how much suppliers can charge per unit of gas and electricity. Analysts at Cornwall Insight expect it to lower the energy price cap from £2,074 a year for the typical household to £1,823, which would be its lowest level since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/03/uk-households-face-record-54-energy-bill-rise-as-price-cap-is-lifted" title="">Russia’s invasion of Ukraine</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/aug/20/a-social-tariff-could-bring-a-warm-glow-to-uk-energy-policy">Continue reading...</a>

## Daniel Foxx: Villain review – a newcomer happy to play the bad guy

<p><strong>Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh<br /></strong>The standup makes his fringe debut with songs, set-pieces and self-acceptance in a winning show</p><p>Do we need more gay heroes? Daniel Foxx thinks so. If you are watching a movie, and “you can’t tell which one of them is meant to be bad,” he sings, “Just ask which one’s most likely to suck off your dad.” Such is Foxx’s pop-culture inheritance that villains (Jafar, Voldemort, Ursula the sea witch) are camp, heroes are straight. Does that make Foxx, with his hair artfully styled into horns, a bad guy? Audiences at the 29-year-old’s fringe debut will surely demur: Villain is a winning hour about self-acceptance and accepting, too, that being a baddie – depending on how you look at it – might not be the worst thing to be.</p><p>As per debut-show convention, Foxx’s set traces his life story, from his schooldays when the word “gay” was a go-to insult and grandad left the room when Elton John appeared on TV. At home, young Daniel nurses a passion for Disney’s Beast, pre-transformation into a prince. At school, bullies shout “bums to the wall” when he enters the room (not an effective defence, as Foxx cheerfully points out). Amid all this, a set-piece revisiting school Nativity plays feels tangential to the queer theme, notwithstanding Foxx’s celebration of his ageing headteacher, muscling aside her charges to appear in the key role of, er, Princess Di.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/20/daniel-foxx-villain-review-pleasance-courtyard-edinburgh">Continue reading...</a>

First up, at the smarter end of the spectrum, is the tailored Bermuda short.

Follow a lead from <strong>Hermès</strong> and style with a sweater, or go for a tonal outfit with leather accessories for an elevated look. <strong>Mr Marvis </strong>have shorts covered, in fabrics from seersucker to linen.

## The Man Who Stole The Scream review – a thought-provoking look at an audacious art heist

<p>Pål Enger was a promising professional footballer who became embroiled in a criminal gang and a notorious theft. Is his story one of lost potential – or of ‘a hooligan thief’?</p><p>The world can be divided into those who love board games and those who would bite the face off anyone who dared to suggest such a pastime. It can also be split according to those who adore fancy dress parties and those who would book root canal surgery in order to miss one. Similarly, there are only two positions to be taken with regard to practical jokers. In one camp, we have those for whom japesters and tricksters are practitioners of a high art who aerate the human condition. In the other, we have those who think they are tedious narcissists who should be gathered on an island and left to prank each other to death.</p><p>I belong firmly in the second camp, so I was predisposed to finding a 90-minute documentary about Pål Enger grating. He is the footballer turned criminal who, in 1994, nicked Edvard Munch’s The Scream from the National Gallery in Oslo, seemingly for no other reason than he could. My frame of mind was aggravated by the fact that I am not terribly relaxed about the true-crime genre, although it is certainly less problematic when it concerns art theft rather than rape or murder.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/aug/19/the-man-who-stole-the-scream-review-a-thought-provoking-look-at-an-audacious-art-heist">Continue reading...</a>

## England’s sheer lack of urgency compounds sense of chaos for Borthwick | Gerard Meagher

<p>Steve Borthwick’s side lack discipline and the kicking game they are wedded to is being dreadfully executed</p><p>Where do England go from here? The only logical answer is home from the World Cup early. Try as they might, they just cannot escape the eye of the storm. That which has swirled around Owen Farrell all week – and will continue to do so at the start of next – has been tempestuous to say the least and on Friday, Dublin was battered by Storm Betty for good measure. There was no let up on the field either from Ireland, who barely got out of second gear, and Billy Vunipola’s red card only adds to the sense of chaos engulfing their World Cup preparations.</p><p>If Steve Borthwick is wedded to a kicking game then that is all well and good but the problem is that England are executing it dreadfully. Ireland could not have been more comfortable in dealing with England’s kick-chase which, like pretty much every other facet of their game, was horribly out of sync. Alex Mitchell was called into the squad at the start of the week after Jack van Poortvliet was ruled out of the World Cup through injury. Maybe Borthwick would have been better off convincing Richard Wigglesworth to lace up his boots again – for the irony is that the scrum-half best suited to carrying out England’s game-plan is currently employed as their attack coach.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/aug/19/england-suffering-from-systemic-failure-with-no-obvious-solution">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Signing players past their peak is one of the mistakes made by a debt-ridden club who fear a relegation they cannot afford</p><p>It will be of no consolation to Everton fans to reflect that their plight is, looked at in a certain light, an indicator of the health of English football. Or at least is a healthy aspect of English football. Everton were one of the Big Five who led the breakaway to set up the Premier League in 1992. In the previous decade they had won two league titles, the FA Cup and the Cup Winners’ Cup. They are still the fourth-most successful team in English top-flight football (level with Manchester City on nine league titles but with more second-place finishes). They could, perhaps should, have become part of the self- perpetuating elite.</p><p>Instead, they are proof that with 30 years of mismanagement (although that has accelerated recently), even the great can find themselves teetering on the brink, staring into the abyss of relegation. While for many clubs the Championship can offer an opportunity for renewal – some fans, indeed, if they can adjust to the loss of status, may find the experience preferable – for Everton it really is something to be feared.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/aug/19/everton-teeter-on-the-brink-after-30-years-of-mismanagement">Continue reading...</a>

If a five-try defeat to a Irish side who can play substantially better was dispiriting enough, they now face the likelihood of being without Billy Vunipola for their opening Rugby World Cup fixture with Argentina, the No 8 having received an upgraded second-half red card to heap further pressure on his beleaguered coaches.</p><p>Vunipola, as with Owen Farrell a week earlier, was initially shown a yellow card, this time for a high shoulder on Andrew Porter.

## The Observer view: only a robust inquiry will hold NHS to account over Lucy Letby murders | Observer editorial

Families need answers from the trust that allowed preventable deaths to happen<p>The murder of premature babies in their first few weeks of life by a medical professional is impossible to make sense of. But this is the crime of which Lucy Letby, a nurse in the neonatal unit at the Countess of Chester hospital, was last week convicted in relation to a number of vulnerable infants entrusted to her care. They were utterly dependent on the clinical staff in that unit. But Letby murdered seven babies, attacking some multiple times before she succeeded in killing them. She has also been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/18/lucy-letby-how-did-a-nurse-commit-such-unthinkable-murders" title="">convicted</a> of the attempted murder of another six, two of whom have been left with brain damage as a result.</p><p>This makes Letby Britain’s worst child killer of modern times. She used a variety of means on her victims, including administering fatal injections of air, poisoning with insulin, overfeeding with milk and tampering with feeding tubes. The police have now begun the task of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/19/trust-me-im-a-nurse-why-wasnt-lucy-letby-stopped-as-months-of-went-by" title="">investigating the records</a> of more than 4,000 babies across two hospitals whose care may have been tampered with by Letby. The critical question that needs answering now the criminal trial is concluded is how she was able to get away with these crimes over the course of more than a year and why some of these murders were not prevented after senior clinicians repeatedly raised red flags about their suspicions. A full assessment of how their babies were fatally let down by the system is the very least the families are owed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/19/observer-editorial-lucy-letby-statutory-inquiry-nhs-failings">Continue reading...</a>

Then my brother and I began clearing out her house and found boxes full of diaries from the 1940s and 50s – nothing revelatory, but they did bring me into a kind of closeness with her that I didn’t have when she was alive, so immediately I wanted to write about her and use this material.

<p><strong>All Points East festival, Victoria Park, London<br /></strong>Slow lovelorn songs make way for a crowd-pleasing succession of hits that has the audience running to the stage</p><p>The last time Stormzy performed live in the UK was early last year, playing arena shows seemingly designed to underline that you were in the presence of Britain’s biggest rapper. There were vast quantities of pyrotechnics, endless flashy lighting effects and a stage set with a giant rendering of the scales of justice. The whole thing was preceded by a lengthy video, trailing his forthcoming third album as if it was a blockbuster film, the first salvo in a campaign that took it as read that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/25/stormzy-this-is-what-i-mean-review-haunted-by-heartbreak-on-his-most-personal-album-yet">This Is What I Mean</a> was going to be one of 2022’s biggest albums.</p><p>A year and a half on, things feel different. This Is What I Mean was an artistic triumph, but it didn’t sell anything like the kind of quantities its predecessors did: a week at No 1 then out of the Top 10 entirely, never to return. Stormzy is clearly still a very big deal – his solitary UK gig of 2023 involves taking over an entire day of the All Points East festival, curating a bill that includes sometime collaborators Sampha and Knucks alongside Kehlani and Ms Banks – but as his headline set begins, the contrast with his last tour is almost jarring. Flashy lighting and special effects are nowhere to be seen. Everything and indeed everyone – a live band, eight backing vocalists – is swathed in muted, tasteful shades of brown and beige: it’s like a Farrow &amp; Ball catalogue. The set is heavy on lovelorn, subtle songs from This Is What I Mean, interspersed with dips into the slow-motion end of his back catalogue: Cigarettes &amp; Cush, Crown. It feels as if you are getting more of Stormzy the singer than Stormzy the rapper for your money.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/19/stormzy-review-all-points-east-festival-victoria-park-london">Continue reading...</a>

## I thought the best place for French food was Britain. Then my holiday breakfast arrived… | Rachel Cooke

<p>I long to believe the French eat better than everyone else. And, for one morning at least, it seemed to be true</p><p>A restaurant with rooms, somewhere in the south of France. At 9am, a perfectly simple breakfast is served: coffee, croissants, apricot jam. But what’s this? On a side plate, sits a rectangular slab of primrose-coloured butter, its dimensions exactly the same as those of the croissants. I’m not big on Instagram, but at this point I can’t resist. Placing a sugar cube beside it for scale, I photograph the butter and post it with the ecstatic (I may mean slightly hysterical) caption: BREAKFAST IN FRANCE. THIS IS HOW TO LIVE!</p><p>Some part of me longs to believe that the French still live superior gustatory lives to our own. Their melons are sweeter, their lunches longer, and no one worries about how much fat is in anything – or so I tell myself. Over supper the night before, a friend and I had talked of the inexpensive set menus we both remember from long ago family holidays, the pair of us competing to reel off the predictable but delicious courses: carrot <em>rappée </em>to start, confit of duck with potatoes and frisée to follow, some cheese and then chocolate mousse or creme caramel to finish. We agreed that there’s lately far too much burrata abroad in <em>la France profonde, </em>burrata being shorthand for the way the country’s restaurant menus have become blurry and fussy. But now I begin to think there may be hope. In what other country would this quantity of butter be considered an essential component of a decent breakfast?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/aug/19/i-thought-the-best-place-for-french-food-was-britain-then-my-holiday-breakfast-arrived">Continue reading...</a>

The resulting soft-focus photographs have been collected in a book, <em>Twilight</em>. “It is the time of day I find most captivating,” says Drooker. “It literally and figuratively refers to gradual decline, so there’s a feeling of melancholy associated with it.

And it is special, the architectural style is typical of the French modernist movement, in the tradition of Le Corbusier with substantial expanses of glass providing lots of natural light. And it makes sense that they hadn’t seen it before – the two-storey house is surrounded by mature trees, offering privacy and a comforting sense of isolation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/aug/19/grandes-marques-a-house-in-champagne-country-this-is-a-vintage-find">Continue reading...</a>

Self-taught on flute and soprano sax, originally inspired by the likes of <a href="https://yuseflateef.com/">Yusef Lateef</a>, Cawthorne has made eclecticism his calling card, with his records encompassing funk, hip-hop and techno, though his most recent outing was an album of ragas recorded in Lahore.</p><p>On <em>You Know I Care</em> there’s not a beat in earshot, as he and a gifted trio honour heroes from the “spiritual jazz” era of the late 60s and 70s. Opener On the Nile, cut by trumpeter Charles Tolliver in 1969, is typical of its time, loaded with an Egyptian melody that Cawthorne blasts on alto sax – a new enthusiasm – though the track belongs as much to the urgent flourishes of pianist Hamish Balfour. On a yearning but elegant set, the late Wayne Shorter’s Infant Eyes and Duke Pearson’s title track, both played on flute, are compositions known for their beauty. Less praised but equally lush is Maimoun by pianist Stanley Cowell, while John Coltrane, composed by Bill Lee (Spike Lee’s father), brings a funkier strain.

<p>Josh Greenbaum reduces the glorious potential of canine humour to a stream of pee and poop gross-out gags, as a scruffy terrier learns to live on the streets</p><p>Anyone who has ever lived with a halfway decent dog will agree that they are endlessly hilarious creatures. Dogs are funny in a multitude of ways, probably the least of which is their connoisseur’s interest in each other’s rear ends, the indiscriminate humping and their erratic toilet habits. But according to this relentlessly basic comedy, this represents pretty much the full scope of canine humour. The tale of Reggie (Will Ferrell), an adorable scruff of a terrier who finds a mismatched band of four-legged friends and gradually comes to terms with his abandonment, <em>Strays</em> is a film that leans heavily on gross-out gags and a pre-adolescent fascination with pee and poop.</p><p>Tonally it’s in the same dog park as the complacently crass <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/04/sausage-party-review-adult-animation-comedy-seth-rogen-kristen-wiig">Sausage Party</a></em> or the abrasive plush-toy profanity of <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/05/ted-seth-macfarlane-review">Ted</a></em>. And like these two pictures, it’s likely to appeal predominantly to the stoner end of the audience spectrum – not least because of an extended sequence in which Reggie and his buddies – a foul-mouthed Boston terrier, a collie bitch and a great Dane with anxiety issues – chow down on magic mushrooms and get messy. To sum up a review with a “dog’s dinner” line would be unconscionably lazy in normal circumstances, but since these pups routinely snack on vomit and faeces, it seems rather apt in this case.</p><p>In cinemas now</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/19/strays-review-a-dogs-dinner">Continue reading...</a>

<p>(International Anthem)<strong><br /></strong>The punk-jazz trumpeter died last year without star recognition but this posthumous album is testament to her inventiveness and commitment to ‘make music into the void’</p><p>When an artist dies young, it often feels as though their passing is especially hard to bear. “So full of life,” is a phrase we reach for. However rote, that sentiment is pretty much unavoidable when you hear the surging, posthumous album by trumpetist, band leader and arch-collaborator Jaimie Branch, who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/aug/24/jaimie-branch-jazz-composer-and-trumpeter-dies-aged-39">died this time last year</a> aged 39. Branch had very nearly finished this third outing under her own name with her Fly Or Die quartet: percussionist Chad Taylor, acoustic bassist Jason Ajemian and cellist-flautist-keyboard player Lester St Louis. Two groundbreaking, energetic studio albums precede it: 2017’s <em>Fly Or Die</em> and 2019’s <em>Fly Or Die II – Bird Dogs of Paradise</em>.</p><p>As the band name suggests, there was a breakneck, YOLO verve to everything Branch did that goes double here. Wolf-like howls punctuate these tracks, vying for primacy with scything, bowed strings. Rhythms drive, tumble and sashay. In the liner notes, her band speak of “longer forms, more modulations and more noise”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/19/jaimie-branch-fly-or-die-fly-or-die-fly-or-die-world-war-review-last-post-from-a-psychedelic-warrior">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh<br /></strong>Mezzo soprano Christine Rice is compelling in the first half while dancers in the dreamlike second part are a revelation in Deborah Warner’s simply staged show</p><p>A terrific cast of musicians and dancers is the core of this skilfully<br />and carefully crafted double bill of Greek myth; one half scales the heights of intense emotion, the other conjures a dream state. First is Phaedra, Benjamin Britten’s last vocal work, written in 1975, with mezzo soprano Christine Rice compelling as the titular princess, all crazed eyes and clear diction as she is blinded by illogical love for stepson Hippolytus.</p><p>Across the rising arc of the music, with the excellent Richard Hetherington sharing the stage on piano, Rice is gripping in the role. She pulls us into Phaedra’s misery, her self-pity, her ardent certainty, her hollowness at knowing no good can come of this. It is simply staged by director Deborah Warner, and a sparse set by Antony McDonald transforms from a black to white backdrop, perfectly timed with the sudden soaring of Rice’s voice going from dark cloud to the bright blaze of full sun.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/19/phaedra-minotaur-review-royal-lyceum-edinburgh">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Royal Albert Hall, London; Arcola, London</strong><br />Three Hungarian-inspired proms combine sizzling energy, Bartók and dada, while an intimate staging ramps up the angst in a Bernstein mini-opera</p><p>Budapest, a city whose musical legacy rivals its Austro-Hungarian past in grandeur and fascination, dusted its aura over the Royal Albert Hall last week: from the <strong>Budapest Festival Orchestra</strong><strong> </strong>and its co-founder, <strong>Iván Fischer</strong>, to his childhood friend and collaborator, the pianist András Schiff; to the composers Béla Bartók, György Ligeti, György Kurtág and Dora Pejačević, all of whom were born or spent time in the Hungarian capital, notably in studies at the celebrated Franz Liszt Academy, established by the composer-pianist whose name it takes.</p><p>The gregarious Fischer, master of ceremonies as well as conductor, led three Proms, including an audience-choice matinee (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m001pg0p">heard on Radio 3</a> – and pithily described by the presenter, Petroc Trelawny, as “delicious chaos”). Choosing from a list of options, the works to be performed were decided by crowd decibel level. I regret that Haydn, long based at Hungary’s stupendous Esterházy Palace, missed the mark: he would have been radical among the inevitably safe choices. This orchestra’s zest and idiomatic style would convert anyone to his music: why does this genius still fall into the shadows?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/19/the-week-in-classical-proms-38-39-prom-40-trouble-in-tahiti-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Horn player Sarah Willis is joined by three Berlin Phil colleagues on her final, joyful Cuban album.

The Havana Lyceum’s orchestral playing matches hers with their own lithe definition, sparkling ornamentation and crisp detail. Cuban rhythms swing with Mozart in Edgar Olivero’s Rondo alla Rumba, inspired by the fourth concerto’s well-known finale, enhanced by spirited playing by small ensemble the Sarahbanda. In Mozart’s Sinfonia Concertante for four winds in E flat, K297b, Willis is joined by her Berlin Phil colleagues Jonathan Kelly, oboe, Wenzel Fuchs, clarinet, and Stefan Schweigert, bassoon. Willis bids farewell to this joyful endeavour in the irresistible Cuban hit Guantanamera (arr. Jorge Aragón). There’s another side to this project: sales of the records have gone towards the <a href="https://sarah-willis.com/instruments-for-cuba">Instruments for Cuba Fund</a>: buy all three and support these wonderful musicians.</p><p>• Recorded in St Cuthbert’s parish church, Edinburgh,<strong> <a href="https://www.delphianrecords.com/products/stuart-macrae-earth-thy-cold-is-keen#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20Stuart%20MacRae%20heard,an%20anonymous%20Middle%20English%20lyric.">Earth, thy cold is keen </a></strong>(Delphian) by the Scottish composer <strong><a href="https://stuartmacrae.com/">Stuart MacRae</a>,</strong> conjures an aural landscape steeped in folk music and medieval lyric, but the result is entirely distinctive and modern. With the Australian mezzo-soprano <strong><a href="https://www.lottebettsdean.com/">Lotte Betts-Dean</a> </strong>and the duo <strong><a href="https://www.sequoiaduo.com/">Sequoia</a></strong> (Alice Rickards, violin, Sonia Cromarty, cello), MacRae adds harmonium or electronics to settings from Middle English, the Norse <em>Poetic Edda</em> and traditional Gaelic, as well as later poems by Christina Rossetti and others. <em>The Captive</em>, a setting of Emily Brontë’s The Prisoner, written for Betts-Dean, suits perfectly the singer’s pure tone and skilful storytelling powers. In sharp contrast, Alwynne Pritchard’s text <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aOH1jwFT2g">elided compressed</a></em> is a playfully spiky collage of voice and electronics. The last song, The Lif of This World, a medieval precis of birth to death in a translation by MacRae, is especially affecting. This is music for slow, close listening, beautifully performed, not for the impatient.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/19/classical-home-listening-sarah-williss-cuban-farewell-vocal-works-by-stuart-macrae">Continue reading...</a>

I doubt I had ever tried one before (back then, we barely even knew what rocket was), but as I helped my exchange family’s grandmother make kilos of jam from the ripe, golden fruits, their sticky, sweet flesh and almond-scented kernels bewitched me. Apricots can be underwhelming in the UK, all dry and flavourless, so seek out a discerning greengrocer to get hold of the real deal. As much as I love apricots in puddings, they also lend a deeply fruity tang to savoury chutneys and relishes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/aug/19/pork-belly-scotch-bonnet-chilli-apricot-relish-recipe-thomasina-miers">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It was meant to end on a high. One final box to tick to cap off the Matildas’ record-breaking World Cup campaign on home soil. But from the first whistle of their third-place playoff game against Sweden it looked unlikely to happen. A first-half penalty by Fridolina Rolfö and a second-half cracker from captain Kosovare Asllani decisively put Australia in fourth place at this tournament. By no means a failure, but not what they wanted.</p><p>It started as a classy display of possession football by Sweden but progressively descended into chaos as the first half progressed. Sweden dominated early and a masterclass from Asllani and Stina Blackstenius brought Mackenzie Arnold into action within a minute of play. Veteran defender Clare Polkinghorne, in the starting XI due to Alanna Kennedy’s concussion-enforced absence, had lunged with all her weight towards Asllani who was able to easily sidestep her and find Blackstenius in space.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/19/matildas-sign-off-with-defeat-as-sweden-secure-third-place-at-womens-world-cup">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Colleen Hoover’s novels took the top six places on last year’s New York Times bestseller list, while in the UK she rivals Richard Osman as the biggest author in recent times. How has she done it?</p><p>The first <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/oct/11/colleen-hoover-author-tiktok-it-ends-with-us" title="">Colleen Hoover book</a> I read was It Ends With Us, and when I opened it on the tube, I saw that the woman next to me was reading It Starts With Us. This is not likely to happen with many authors; but as of last year, Hoover was the bestselling novelist in the US, occupying the top six places on the New York Times bestseller list. “To even compare her to other successful authors,” wrote Alexandra Alter of that newspaper, “fails to capture the size and loyalty of her audience.” In the UK, her dominance is somewhat challenged by the remarkable sales of Richard Osman, who had three books <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/bestselling-books-2022-ltq8sxhgw" title="">in four of the Sunday Times top spots</a> in 2022, but she was still named by that paper as “undoubtedly the biggest author of the year”.</p><p>A classic Hoover novel circles round the imperatives of romantic love with distinctively 21st-century impediments, two twentysomethings kept apart not by their parents or society or class or money, but by their own emotional affectlessness. They’re too busy, or too damaged, or too empty or numb for love; they just want no-strings sex. The strings then duly appear and catch them in a formulaic but solid cat’s cradle.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/19/its-like-comfort-eating-why-readers-are-hungry-for-colleen-hoover">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Royal Albert Hall, London<br /></strong>For its UK premiere, György Kurtág’s opera faced a challenge summoning the play’s claustrophobia in this venue, but performances and players were superb</p><p>Michael Billington, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/oct/16/endgame-review-by-michael-billington">writing about Endgame in these pages a while ago</a>, once used the phrase “the terrible music of Beckett’s prose” to describe the bitter beauty of the play’s language. In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/16/i-compose-to-seek-the-truth-gyorgy-kurtag-on-totalitarianism-depression-and-his-73-year-marriage">György Kurtág’</a>s opera, the words retain their fierce, lacerating power, though the music extends a deep and ambivalent compassion to Beckett’s characters even as their rebarbative sparring masks fears of decline, isolation, endings and loss. This is not, in essence, the bleak comedy we often find, but a work of pervasive sadness that continues to haunt us after its final notes have died away.</p><p>Considered a masterpiece by many at its 2018 Milan premiere, Endgame (more correctly Fin de Partie, as Kurtág uses the French text) has now been given its first UK performance at the Proms by the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra under Ryan Wigglesworth, in a semi-staging by Victoria Newlyn. Playing and conducting, as one might expect, were superb. Wigglesworth dug deep into the score’s detail while maintaining the dramatic pressure throughout, and you couldn’t help but be struck both by Kurtág’s fastidious craftsmanship and the way every verbal and musical gesture tells, often through the sparest and simplest of means. Flaring brass suggested fury, futile or otherwise, and cimbalom taps quietly frayed the protagonists’ nerves. But there were also moments of quite extraordinary beauty, particularly as Nell (Hilary Summers) and Nagg (Leonardo Cortellazzi) lose themselves in memories of the past.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/19/prom-43-endgame-review-royal-albert-hall-london">Continue reading...</a>

While some schools still require parents to fork out on pricey gear that can only be bought from specialist shops, others will let you buy the whole lot on the high street, allowing some to take advantage of low-cost deals such as Aldi and Lidl’s £5 “uniform bundles” (typically two polo shirts, one sweatshirt and trousers or skirt).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/aug/19/back-to-school-do-uniforms-really-need-to-cost-a-fortune">Continue reading...</a>

While there, she is believed to have taken a substance called wachuma, or San Pedro cactus, a powerful hallucinogen used by Indigenous people in the Andes for thousands of years.</p><p>But Hyatt did not experience relief; instead, her mental health worsened. Three months later, she described being in “some sort of psychotic break” and feeling as if her brain was going to explode. Later that autumn she took her own life.

<p>Puff pastry is the perfect vessel for showing off the intense fruit in this elegant tart of peaches on a bed of frangipane with a basil-lime glaze</p><p>Summer fruit puddings, for me, are all about ratios. I want my tastebuds to be flooded with beautiful fruit first, then chased down with the merest hint of cream, pastry, crumble or whatever. The puff pastry tart boasts the largest surface area of all tarts, so lends itself perfectly to the job, in that you can cover every inch of the pastry with fruit. Stone fruits are best, and peaches are my favourite, especially when layered over a thin cardamom and almond frangipane, as they are in today’s recipe. When the peach roasts down, it tastes like a more intense and concentrated version of itself. Like summer, distilled.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/aug/19/vegan-peach-almond-cardamom-basil-puff-tart-recipe-meera-sodha">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When I moved to LA, I discovered my house had been the scene of a notorious 1920s crime involving a leading lady, her vaudeville star husband and an actor with matinee idol looks …</p><p>Even as a novice crime writer, I probably ought to have discovered the killing that took place in my own front room sooner than I did. After all, the coroner declared it “the most brutal murder that has ever come under my notice” and the Los Angeles Times labelled my home the “Hollywood House of Death”.</p><p>Or perhaps I have that the wrong way round, and it was living here that turned me into a crime writer. Certainly, I had no such ambitions or qualifying expertise when I moved in: my previous book was a sci-fi comedy, and the protagonist of my crime novel is not a detective but an NHS junior doctor, the job I was doing when a screenplay I wrote first landed me some writing work in Los Angeles.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/19/a-neighbour-said-we-didnt-want-to-scare-you-how-i-became-obsessed-with-the-dark-past-of-my-hollywood-home">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Comedian was ‘Beckham-mad’ and says playing for partially sighted team ‘is hard, but it should be’</p><p>Inside the reception of the hotel at St George’s Park, home to all 23 England teams, there is a striking, backlit canvas that celebrates the country’s most capped players. The England cap wall features those from the men’s, women’s, para and futsal teams who have at least 50 caps. Parallel with Alan Shearer and nestled above Harry Kane is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLxdII5msg">the comedian Josh Pugh</a>, a staple of the partially sighted team vying to win the IBSA World Games. “Sir Stanley Matthews is on it, Sir Bobby Charlton, bloody Beckham, it’s just amazing,” says Pugh, who is set to win his 62nd cap on Saturday. “I never get bored of seeing it. If my little boy goes there when he’s 20 and sees his dad’s name … I’m so proud.”</p><p>England’s partially sighted team are amateurs but prepare as professionally as possible. They study opposition clips, work with sports scientists and nutritionists, and swap pennants and sing the national anthem before their futsal matches. A draw with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdF9awIdYwI">Italy in their final Group A match</a> would cement a place in Monday’s semi-finals. “This is our World Cup,” Pugh says. “We eat properly, we train hard. It’s hard. But it should be; it should be hard to be an England player.” At the start of the week the squad received good-luck messages from friends and family. “I’m a Celebrity-style,” he says. “We once had a manager who made us watch a clip from the film 300 and we had a player sent off inside the first 10 minutes the next day.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/19/josh-pugh-spearheads-englands-partially-sighted-team-at-world-games">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Smart machines are meant to work for us, but there are already signs that we will end up working for them. What will the workplace of the future look like, and will your role still exist?</p><p>At the 2021 Australian and US Open tennis championships, all the line judges were replaced by machines. This was, in many ways, inevitable. Not only are these machines far more accurate than any human at calling balls in or out, but they can also be programmed to make their calls in a human-like voice, so as not to disorient the players. It is a little eerie, the disembodied shriek of “Out!” coming from nowhere on the court (at the Australian Open the machines are programmed to speak with an Australian accent). But it is far less irritating than the delays required by challenging incorrect calls, and far more reliable. It takes very little getting used to.</p><p>In the slew of reports published in the 2010s looking to identify which jobs were most at risk of being automated out of existence, sports officials usually ranked very high up the list (the best known of these studies, by Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040162516302244" title="">in 2017</a>, put a 98% probability on sports officiating being phased out by computers within 20 years). Here, after all, is a human enterprise where the single most important qualification is an ability to get the answer right. In or out? Ball or strike? Fair or foul? These are decisions that need to be underpinned by accurate intelligence. The technology does not even have to be state-of-the-art to produce far better answers than humans can. Hawk-Eye systems have been outperforming human eyesight for nearly 20 years. They were first officially adopted for tennis line calls in 2006, to check cricket umpire decisions in 2009 and, more recently, to rule on football offsides.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/19/the-end-of-work-which-jobs-will-survive-the-ai-revolution">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This exploration of where, why and how we sleep (or don’t) is as intelligent as it is eccentric</p><p>“All our body wants is to sleep, it wants to leave us, head back to the stable, a worn-out horse,” writes Marie Darrieussecq, at which I, a worn-out human, think <em>yes</em>. In a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOXntvhyHcA" title="">interview</a>, Darrieussecq reflected on how much of her work is concerned with inhabiting. Who has a right to inhabit this planet, she asks, and who doesn’t? Though she was talking about her novel Crossed Lines, in which a Parisian woman finds her life becoming bound up with that of a young Nigerian refugee, she could just as well be referring to Sleepless<em> </em>(<em>Pas Dormir</em> in the original French), a book that is – what? A memoir/interrogation/painting/song of insomnia, her own and that of others. It’s a book about where, why, how we sleep and don’t sleep; about how to find a place in the world where sleep can happen, a stable for the worn-out horse.</p><p>Sleepless isn’t a book that’s straightforward to convey, at least not briefly. On the page it’s fragmentary, footnoted and studded with photos and illustrations. It’s panoramic in its survey of insomniac literature, and also softly intimate where it touches on the author’s own life. In its range and genre it’s unpindownable. Darrieussecq is one of the most prolific and distinguished living writers in France with a truly impressive body of work. All her familiar acuity, humour, humility and intensity are evident in Sleepless.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/19/sleepless-by-marie-darrieussecq-review-a-poetic-panoramic-memoir-of-insomnia">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Agricultural shows are a highlight of the British summer, combining farming heritage with the village fete to bring an eccentric joyfulness</p><p>• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/aug/18/10-of-the-uk-best-country-shows">10 of the UK’s best country shows</a></p><p>Several years ago I was asked to judge the homemade wines at a local agricultural show. I have written to tight deadlines at World Cups and delivered a speech in the Long Room at Lord’s; neither filled me with quite the same feelings of pressure and anxiety. I knew how seriously such competitions are taken, the strength of feelings they evoke. I had nightmares of being strangled with a siphoning tube. Fortunately my co-judge was more experienced and sanguine. She also held the old-fashioned opinion that swirling the wines around your mouth before spitting them in a bucket was uncouth, and so following her lead I drank a small glass of each. There were more than 20 entries, and after half an hour my fears had dematerialised into a fuzzy summer glow.</p><p>That was before the pandemic. These days anyone taking a similar approach to judging homemade wines would probably end up being hospitalised, thanks to the sheer range and number of entries. During lockdown people all over the country filled their days rediscovering old crafts, baking, brewing and winemaking among them. Entries for the industrial tent (originally for displaying the work of rural craftspeople, but showing everything from baking to children’s art, knitting, jam and photography) at agricultural shows have soared.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/aug/19/ferret-racing-and-giant-marrows-how-uk-country-shows-keep-rural-traditions-alive">Continue reading...</a>

## Jane McDonald: Lost in Japan – she’s no Anthony Bourdain, but watching her is astonishingly joyous

<p>From slamming into a sumo wrestler to taking a GoPro into a public toilet, Jane is clearly having the time of her life – setting this charming celebrity travelogue apart from the rest</p><p>A good question to ask strangers at parties is: “What TV programme would you most like to appear on?” There are the obvious answers: Who<em> </em>Wants to Be a Millionaire is many people’s kneejerk go-to, and a lot of them want to be on Countdown, too. You will be surprised how many adults with full-time jobs are demonically addicted to watching The Chase and so want to be on The Chase, to meet Bradley Walsh if nothing else. I met someone once whose parents had been on both Antiques Roadshow and Time Team, which I think for many people is the fulfilment of their wildest, most fantastic dreams. And, of course, everyone thinks they’d be really good at Taskmaster. But I would like to throw a new contender into the mix, an outsider without much fanfare who is nevertheless making a convincing run at the title – Jane McDonald: Lost in Japan (Friday, 9pm, Channel 5).</p><p>How would I explain Jane McDonald: Lost in Japan? I would say it’s like this: Jane McDonald goes to Japan. We have been needing someone to fill the enormous void left by Anthony Bourdain for years, and Jane McDonald is not the one to do it, but the particular texture of travelogue she is bringing here is a joy to watch. Jane McDonald checks into a Shibuya hotel, points to a sign on the 34th floor, and goes: “Oop, that’s my bra size.” She introduces us to the concept of futuristic robotic toilets with the sentence: “Now, I don’t like to get caught short while I’m travelling, so I’m going to spend a penny – or a yen.” There’s a bizarrely long scene where she buys a travelcard for the subway, turns to the camera, and says: “See, that was really, really easy. Even for me. HA!” then wanders off. She takes a GoPro into a public toilet and describes the facilities as “a bit fab”. She sits quietly on the subway, arms folded neatly on her lap, and murmurs: “I don’t want to do my country down, but someone really should come and have a look at how this is run.” It is astonishing, liquid television, and I can only imagine the camera operators on this show had the time of their life following Jane McDonald around, watching her bow too much and stare in marvel at a really busy pedestrian crossing, looking at the clean pavements in wonder. Obviously, she also sings karaoke whenever humanly possible.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/aug/19/jane-mcdonald-lost-in-japan-shes-no-anthony-bourdain-but-watching-her-is-astonishingly-joyous">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Russia’s possession of nuclear arms is response to threats, Lavrov says; rise in Ukraine battlefield casualties brings total close to half a million</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">See all our Ukraine war coverage</a></li></ul><p><strong>Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov says Moscow’s possession of nuclear weapons protects the country from external security threats</strong>, while reminding the west of the risks of a nuclear conflict. “The possession of nuclear arms is today the only possible response to some of significant external threats to security of our country,” Lavrov said in an interview for state-owned magazine The International Affairs. Lavrov warned the US and Nato allies risk ending up in “a situation of direct armed confrontation of nuclear powers”. “We believe such a development should be prevented. That’s why we have to remind about the existence of high military and political risks and send sobering signals to our opponents,” Lavrov said.</p><p><strong>The number of battlefield casualties in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> is approaching nearly 500,000 Russian and Ukrainian soldiers</strong>, US officials have told the New York Times, marking a significant rise in the death toll this year after intense fighting in the east of the country. Russia’s military casualties are approaching 300,000, the officials claimed, with as many as 120,000 killed in action. Ukraine was said to have close to 70,000 killed and 100,000-120,000 wounded. Fierce fighting near Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine have led to significant casualties on both sides, more than doubling the number of dead since November.</p><p><strong>Ukrainian forces could fail to retake the Russian-occupied strategic south-eastern city of Melitopol during their counteroffensive</strong>, a US official said. Melitopol has been under Russian control since March 2022 and has roads and railways used by its troops to transport supplies to areas they occupy. The US official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, was citing an intelligence report, but the prediction is largely in line with Washington’s view that Ukraine’s counteroffensive is progressing slower than expected. The official added that despite the report and limited progress towards Melitopol, the US believed it was still possible to change the gloomy outlook.</p><p><strong>One person was killed and two injured as a result of Russian shelling of a village near the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson</strong>, according to the prosecutor general’s office said. Some private houses were damaged in the attack, but no further details were provided. In a separate case, four people were injured after Russia shelled a residential area of the city of Chasiv Yar, located in the Donetsk region close to Bakhmut.</p><p><strong>Russia is continuing its crackdown against critics at home and abroad, with authorities shut down prominent rights group the Sakharov Centre</strong>, saying it had illegally hosted conferences and exhibitions. Critics say the group is the latest target of the Kremlin’s battle against liberal-leaning organisations that challenge the state. Separately, a Russian court has placed the co-chair of independent election monitoring group Golos in pre-trial detention until at least 17 October. The ruling comes as Russia gears up for regional elections next month. Moscow also announced sanctions against international criminal court prosecutor Karim Khan, who in March issued a warrant against Putin accusing him of having “illegally deported” thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia.</p><p><strong>Kyiv has welcomed a US decision to let Denmark and the Netherlands hand F-16 fighter jets over to Ukraine once its pilots are trained to use them.</strong> A US official confirmed Denmark and the Netherlands had been given “formal assurances” for the jet transfer. Training by an 11-nation coalition is to begin this month, and officials hope pilots will be ready by early 2024. Ukrainian defence minister Oleksii Reznikov hailed “great news from our friends in the United States”.</p><p><strong>Russian forces have destroyed Ukrainian drones targeting Moscow and its Black Sea fleet.</strong> Russia’s defence ministry said its air force had downed a Ukrainian drone over the capital early Friday morning. Footage showed damage to an expo centre on the Krasnopresnenskaya embankment of the Moskva River, 100 metres from Moscow city.</p><p><strong>Ukrainian prime minister Denys Shmyhal hailed “important and constructive” talks on grain exports with his Romanian counterpart Marcel Ciolacu during a visit to Bucharest</strong>. Ciolacu said Romania wanted to double the amount of Ukrainian grain transiting his country to 4m tonnes. The talks came a day after the first civilian cargo ship sailed through the Black Sea from Ukraine to Istanbul in defiance of a Russian blockade.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/19/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-542-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>
