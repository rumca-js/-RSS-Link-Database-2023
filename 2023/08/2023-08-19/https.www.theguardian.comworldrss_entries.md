Obviously we are talking decades away, given the time-frame, we are talking -- we don’t get the first AUKUS submarine for a number of decades.</p><p>So, the reality is this is some decades off, but it is right that people are raising it. We know this is a challenge and we will make sure there is a process in place to address it.</p><p>I want to talk about what is really happening. What is happening is we are seeing a change in strategic balance in the region. We are seeing more challenging strategic circumstances. The question is not commenting about it, the question is what we do about it, and what we have to do with other countries is to ensure that there is a strategic balance in the region, that we want to make sure that, you know, no country ever thinks that conflict is worth it. That’s the calculus we always have to change and we do that both by deterrence and reassurance. That’s what Aukus contributes to, just as that’s what our diplomacy, our development assistance and engagement contribute to.</p><p>I think we know, and I think we’ve been very upfront about it what is happening in terms of the military buildup in the region. We know that there is greater strategic competition between the great powers. We know what has been happening in our region. We’ve seen recently exercises in the Taiwan strait and events in the Philippines.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/aug/20/australia-news-live-matildas-world-cup-indigenous-voice-penny-wong-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-cpac-conference">Continue reading...</a>
