Obviously we are talking decades away, given the time-frame, we are talking -- we don\u2019t get the first AUKUS submarine for a number of decades.</p><p>So, the reality is this is some decades off, but it is right that people are raising it. We know this is a challenge and we will make sure there is a process in place to address it.</p><p>I want to talk about what is really happening. What is happening is we are seeing a change in strategic balance in the region. We are seeing more challenging strategic circumstances. The question is not commenting about it, the question is what we do about it, and what we have to do with other countries is to ensure that there is a strategic balance in the region, that we want to make sure that, you know, no country ever thinks that conflict is worth it. That\u2019s the calculus we always have to change and we do that both by deterrence and reassurance. That\u2019s what Aukus contributes to, just as that\u2019s what our diplomacy, our development assistance and engagement contribute to.</p><p>I think we know, and I think we\u2019ve been very upfront about it what is happening in terms of the military buildup in the region. We know that there is greater strategic competition between the great powers. We know what has been happening in our region. We\u2019ve seen recently exercises in the Taiwan strait and events in the Philippines.</p> <a
