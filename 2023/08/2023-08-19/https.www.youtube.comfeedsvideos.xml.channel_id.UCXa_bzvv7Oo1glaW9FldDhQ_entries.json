This feature highlights 15 key facets of Lies of P which you\u2019ll need to know before buying, with a particular focus on its combat mechanics and character customisation.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxjHekAl5Q", "date_published": "2023-08-19T22:00:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/5yxjHekAl5Q/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "All Factions And Everything We Know About Them - Before You Play Starfield | Lore", "description": "Any time you\u2019re playing a Bethesda Game Studios RPG, if there\u2019s one thing you can take as a sureshot guarantee, it\u2019s that the world you\u2019ll be exploring will be brimming with rich lore and worldbuilding to make it all come alive. \n\nAnd though the upcoming Starfield is obviously going to set itself apart from past BGS titles in several ways simply by virtue of being a completely new thing, that\u2019s the one area where we can safely expect to have a pretty good idea of what we\u2019ll be in for. \n\nBethesda has already spoken plenty about Starfield\u2019s setting, the Settled Systems, and the many factions that will populate that setting, and here, we\u2019re going to take a look at each one and go over everything that we know about them so far.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IluOzcU6It8", "date_published": "2023-08-19T18:00:13+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/IluOzcU6It8/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Red Dead Redemption PS4 (via PS5) Review - DIFFICULT TO RECOMMEND", "description": "When Rockstar Games first released Red Dead Redemption, it wasn't to create a GTA clone but set in the Wild West. It delivered a compelling story with memorable characters and offered a unique open world to explore, full of mysteries.\n\nEven though it was released in 2013 and had a much bigger sequel, Red Dead Redemption is still one of the best games ever made. Despite the limits of the Xbox 360 and PS3, its presentation, narrative and overall gameplay are excellent.\n\nSo, it's a shame to see it re-released for the PS4 (backwards compatible on PS5) at $50, with minor graphical improvements and very little else. For all the accolades, it's difficult to recommend this, even if you really should play the original.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0qyTtdXO70", "date_published": "2023-08-19T06:30:06+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/E0qyTtdXO70/hqdefault.jpg"}]
