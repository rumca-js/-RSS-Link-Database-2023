Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse continues the story of Miles Morales in one of the best ways imaginable. And much like I discussed in my video about the fiirst movie (Into The Spider-Verse — Greatness Through Reversal), a lot of its strength comes from reversals. But even more than that, the movie is just really smart. Smart to the point of being cool. It's like Sam Rockwell or Captain Jack Sparrow... it can entertain you effortlessly. How? Irony and choice. So in today's Film Perfection, let's see what exactly Across the Spider-Verse does to be so clever and witty, and we can do that too!
