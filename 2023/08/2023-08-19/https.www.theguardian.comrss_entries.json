If a five-try defeat to a Irish side who can play substantially better was dispiriting enough, they now face the likelihood of being without Billy Vunipola for their opening Rugby World Cup fixture with Argentina, the No 8 having received an upgraded second-half red card to heap further pressure on his beleaguered coaches.</p><p>Vunipola, as with Owen Farrell a week earlier, was initially shown a yellow card, this time for a high shoulder on Andrew Porter. But, to no one\u2019s surprise, it was his final act of another game that England would prefer to forget. One day they will tighten up their discipline and keep 15 players on the field for an entire 80 minutes but, as yet, there is no immediate sign of it.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/19/ireland-england-rugby-union-match-report\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/19/ireland-england-rugby-union-match-report", "date_published": "2023-08-19T18:50:51+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Sarr strike and Mart\u00ednez own goal give Spurs edge against Manchester United", "description": "<p>A warm sun over White Hart Lane, only a few wisps of white in the vast blue sky.

They were utterly dependent on the clinical staff in that unit. But Letby murdered seven babies, attacking some multiple times before she succeeded in killing them.

This was, in many ways, inevitable. Not only are these machines far more accurate than any human at calling balls in or out, but they can also be programmed to make their calls in a human-like voice, so as not to disorient the players. It is a little eerie, the disembodied shriek of \u201cOut!\u201d coming from nowhere on the court (at the Australian Open the machines are programmed to speak with an Australian accent).

It takes very little getting used to.</p><p>In the slew of reports published in the 2010s looking to identify which jobs were most at risk of being automated out of existence, sports officials usually ranked very high up the list (the best known of these studies, by Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040162516302244\" title=\"\">in 2017</a>, put a 98% probability on sports officiating being phased out by computers within 20 years).

These are decisions that need to be underpinned by accurate intelligence. The technology does not even have to be state-of-the-art to produce far better answers than humans can. Hawk-Eye systems have been outperforming human eyesight for nearly 20 years.

Jane McDonald checks into a Shibuya hotel, points to a sign on the 34th floor, and goes: \u201cOop, that\u2019s my bra size.\u201d She introduces us to the concept of futuristic robotic toilets with the sentence: \u201cNow, I don\u2019t like to get caught short while I\u2019m travelling, so I\u2019m going to spend a penny \u2013 or a yen.\u201d There\u2019s a bizarrely long scene where she buys a travelcard for the subway, turns to the camera, and says: \u201cSee, that was really, really easy. Even for me. HA!\u201d then wanders off. She takes a GoPro into a public toilet and describes the facilities as \u201ca bit fab\u201d. She sits quietly on the subway, arms folded neatly on her lap, and murmurs: \u201cI don\u2019t want to do my country down, but someone really should come and have a look at how this is run.\u201d It is astonishing, liquid television, and I can only imagine the camera operators on this show had the time of their life following Jane McDonald around, watching her bow too much and stare in marvel at a really busy pedestrian crossing, looking at the clean pavements in wonder.

Ukraine was said to have close to 70,000 killed and 100,000-120,000 wounded.

Melitopol has been under Russian control since March 2022 and has roads and railways used by its troops to transport supplies to areas they occupy. The US official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, was citing an intelligence report, but the prediction is largely in line with Washington\u2019s view that Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive is progressing slower than expected.
