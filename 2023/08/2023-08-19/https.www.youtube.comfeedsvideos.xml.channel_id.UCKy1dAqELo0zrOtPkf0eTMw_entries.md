Monarch: Legacy of Monsters is coming to Apple’s streaming service, expanding the burgeoning Monsterverse Legendary is creating with Godzilla and King Kong. As it pertains to the movie timeline, the series will take place after the #Godzilla 2014 film, where we saw San Francisco left in ruins. And it’s great to see the connection between that particular movie to the series, as you might remember the mysterious Monarch group debuted in the 2014 movie. In other news, Adventure Time fans should be happy to hear that there’s another series coming soon to Max streaming! Adventure Time: Fionna and Cake is coming to Max August 31st, focusing on the alt versions of Finn and Jake.
