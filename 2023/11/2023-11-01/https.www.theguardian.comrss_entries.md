<p>This was a triumph for Newcastle, another fiasco from Manchester United and, maybe soon, a real problem for Erik ten Hag. A problem of the job security-nature because after declaring himself confident that he and his players could revive their season following Sunday’s 3-0 humiliation here by Manchester City continuing their Carabao Cup defence was a prerequisite.</p><p>Be knocked out by Newcastle and the vultures would circle over the manager despite Eddie Howe’s side having downed City in the previous round. Yet this is precisely what occurred on a night when all of the goals conceded by United were self-inflicted and spoke of a paucity of cohesion and troubling confidence-deficit.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/01/manchester-united-newcastle-carabao-cup-fourth-round-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Douglas Henshall has departed, but Ashley Jensen’s arrival proves the hit  crime drama doesn’t need a leading man – especially when paired with the brilliant Alison O’Donnell <br /></p><p>Can Shetland still be Shetland without DI Jimmy Perez? Douglas Henshall spent seven seasons nudging the BBC One sleuth up the ranks of British crime shows, playing a bruised, haunted homicide detective with no gimmick apart from the steady erosion of his will. Last year, Perez finally crumbled, driven out of the force by an injustice that required rules to be broken, and by his desire to no longer be left personally broken-hearted by the job. Henshall quit the show, having created a TV copper of rare nuance.</p><p>Shetland has returned nonetheless, and it has plenty of attractions left to compensate for Henshall’s considerable absence. Most obvious is the setting, its treeless vistas painted in dark, guilty greens and greys, suddenly forgiven by the clean blue of the sea. The landscape’s alluring

It looks very sinister. But it’s nothing to do with the Ku Klux Klan or anything like that. It’s about intense religious feeling. I shot it in Seville, Spain. I went there in April 2019, specifically to experience Semana Santa, their Holy Week: seven days of deeply religious ceremonies and rituals. Carrying crosses and wearing long robes, capes and pointed hoods that cover their faces, the Nazarenos take part in a massive, spectacular procession. “Nazarenos” take their name from Nazareth but are also known as <em>los penitentes</em>, the penitent ones. Their procession is about devotion and penitence. The parade goes on for miles – it’s one of the most impressive religious events you can see on the planet.</p>

<p>The Khan Yunis refugee camp was supposed to be in the safe zone. But nowhere is safe – the very existence of Palestinians is under attack</p><p>My family home was supposed to be in the safe zone in southern Gaza. But last week the bombs came anyway, without warning. They fell at around 10 o’clock on Thursday morning in four or five big explosions. An entire residential quarter of the Khan Yunis refugee camp, where I was born and raised, was reduced to rubble. Everyone there experienced it as an earthquake; a human-made earthquake. The whole camp was shaking.</p><p>I’ve counted 49 dead – among them are 36 members of my family.

<p>When they weren’t having screaming rows, the members of this overlooked 1930s collective changed the course of cultural history. Why isn’t it better known?</p><p>The year is 1937, and at a farmhouse in a village on the edge of the Chilterns named Fawley Bottom, two of the greatest artists of the 20th century have retired to the piano. It is August bank holiday weekend and as “rows – and more rows” detonate around them, Wystan-Hugh Auden picks out the melody to Stormy Weather with a single finger, while Benjamin Britten improvises a masterful accompaniment.</p><p>Auden, Britten and others including the poet Stephen Spender had been summoned to the home of the artist John Piper for the Group Theatre congress.

<p>Vivid portrait of the great playwright of inertia points up the contrast with his real-life romantic entanglements and daring work for the French resistance</p><p>Director James Marsh has boldly, maybe even sacrilegiously, given us a Hollywoodised biopic of Samuel Beckett. It starts with Beckett surreally escaping the Nobel ceremony to talk in private with a doppelganger confessor – a breezier, more worldly self in a rollneck sweater and jacket – and glumly wondering to whom in his life he should penitentially give the prize money, a guilt list which ushers in the flashbacks.</p><p>It isn’t hard to imagine what the man himself would have said about this movie, but though a little hammy, it is well acted and tells the story with verve, tackling the paradox of Beckett’s bleak fictional universe of stymied inaction and his dramatic real life of service in the French resistance and romantic intrigue. There’s a very thoughtful, weighted performance from Gabriel Byrne as Beckett, auster

The House of Representatives will convene at 12pm eastern time today and potentially takes votes on three resolutions that underscore the bitterness coursing through Congress’s lower chamber. The first is to expel <strong>George Santos</strong>, the freshman lawmaker who admitted to lying about most of his resume and now faces federal charges. The resolution, backed by some fellow New York Republicans who occupy vulnerable seats, needs the support of two-thirds of the chamber to pass. It’s unclear if they have that margin, but the issue is likely to split Republicans, who control the House by a mere four seats and therefore cannot afford to lose Santos’s vote.</p><p>Also up for consideration today is a resolution introduced by rightwing Republican <strong>Marjorie Taylor Greene</strong> to censure Democrat

<p>How a self-defeating obsession derailed the career of one of Britain’s most successful comedy writers</p><p>When Graham Linehan was starting out as a comedy writer in London, he would go to see standup where he would upbraid audience members who were “talking or otherwise being rude”. Once, while watching Noel Fielding and Julian Barratt’s The Mighty Boosh in a pub theatre, a drunk man began shouting, so Linehan told him to “shut the fuck up”. Later, the man followed him into the toilets where he smashed down the cubicle door. “Thankfully,” Linehan recalls, “he’d expended all his energy on kicking the door in so I was able to see him off with the force of my terrified stare.”</p><p>Wading into other people’s fights has proved a theme for the co-writer of Father Ted and writer-director of The IT Crowd. A vociferous critic of the transgender rights movement, Linehan’s views have, in recent years, cost him friends, his livelihood and, he claims, his marriage. But, despite having been

At around 7.30pm on 11 May 1910 at the Wellington Pit in Whitehaven, a buildup of methane was set alight by a stray spark, possibly caused by a faulty safety lamp.

Four escaped, but the rest remained unaccounted for. Although one of the survivors immediately went back into the mine to aid the rescue party, conditions proved impossible.

<p>Brilliant Spain midfielder is making an impact on and off the pitch and deserves all the accolades coming her way</p><p>It was never in doubt, was it? As Aitana Bonmatí’s name was read out in Paris on Monday night, there was a collective sigh of relief that the Spanish midfielder, arguably the world’s best player by some distance in the last 12 months, had been crowned the 2023 Women’s Ballon d’Or winner. It is yet another accolade to add to her growing collection as the 25-year-old became the youngest recipient of the award. It means she has picked up almost every prize available for both club and country, collectively and individually, over the 2022-23 season.</p><p>Being part of an era that has been able to enjoy Bonmatí play football is a privilege. Whether watching Barcelona or Spain and despite being surrounded by indisputable stars, one’s eye is automatically drawn to the diminutive figure at the heart of midfield. She has received praise from her peers, male and female, wh
