That excitement, however, has been tinged with its fair share of anxiety as time has gone by. \n\nIt\u2019s been more than a year since the game was announced, and in the time since then, there have been virtually no new meaningful updates on it from either Konami or developer Bloober Team, in spite of the fact that the latter has said on a couple of occasions now that the remake is nearing the end of development. So where exactly is Silent Hill 2? When are we going to see it again? Will it launch anytime soon?
