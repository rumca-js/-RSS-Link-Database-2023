Bungie has had its share of ups and downs through the years, but it's remained relatively successful thanks to the Destiny franchise. It makes the sudden news of layoffs even more shocking, as eight percent of total employees were reportedly let go.

However, there's more to the story than the studio being the latest victim of layoffs in a rough year for job security in the games industry. With Destiny 2: The Final Shape reportedly delayed to June 2024 and Marathon allegedly coming in 2025, it seems that the company's leadership is failing to do right by its employees and fans.

Here's what you need to know about Bungie's latest kerfuffle and what led to the layoffs and reported delays it's now facing.

Silent Hill 2’s remake might be just one of three games that will be spearheading Konami’s revival of the beloved psychological horror franchise, but given the mountainous legacy of the original game, it’s not hard to see why it’s also the one that’s got people the most excited. That excitement, however, has been tinged with its fair share of anxiety as time has gone by. 

It’s been more than a year since the game was announced, and in the time since then, there have been virtually no new meaningful updates on it from either Konami or developer Bloober Team, in spite of the fact that the latter has said on a couple of occasions now that the remake is nearing the end of development. So where exactly is Silent Hill 2? When are we going to see it again? Will it launch anytime soon? Here, we talk about all of that and more.
