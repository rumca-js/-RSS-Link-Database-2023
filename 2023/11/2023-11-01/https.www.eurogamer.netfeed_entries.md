Acclaimed Souls-like shooter sequel Remnant 2 is poised to receive its first expansion, The Awakened King, on 17th November, and developer Gunfire Games is celebrating today's release date news with a DLC teaser trailer.
</p><p>
The Awakened King features a brand-new storyline focusing on the One True King, a being corrupted by the Root during his near-death slumber and now out for revenge. It's up to players to uncover the king's secrets by exploring a new area of Losomn - the announcement makes mention of a castle overlooking a Dran coastal town, but doesn't clarify if this is where the DLC is set - containing new dungeons and "unexpected allies".
</p><p>
There's also talk of powerful new weapons and equipment to acquire - including new modifications, amulets, and rings - plus fearsome new enemies and bosses,

Developer Rovio has said it is now blocking a "disturbing" pro-Israel ad featuring graphic content after a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/graphic-pro-israel-ads-make-their-way-into-childrens-video-games-2023-10-30/">Reuters report</a> highlighted its discovery in Angry Birds and a number of other family orientated games.
</p><p>
According to Reuters, the pro-Israel ad - created by the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs as part of an "advocacy drive" amid the continuing Israel-Hamas war - featured images of Hamas militants, rocket attacks, terrified Israeli families, explosions, and blurred graphic footage, culminating in the message, "We will make sure that those who harm us pay a heavy price."

Speaking to Reuters, an Israeli government official confirmed the ads were part of a $1.5m USD campaign but insisted advertise

Bethesda has announced it'll finally be introducing a number of much-requested graphics features to Starfield next week - including its long-awaited Nvidia DLSS support - with all initially arriving as a Steam Beta update prior to general release.
</p><p>
PC players have aired their frustration with Starfield's lack of DLSS support since prior to the game's launch (its absence was initially believed to be the result of Bethesda's partnership with AMD, although AMD insisted otherwise), and it wasn't until September - one week after the game's arrival - that Bethesda <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-getting-dlss-support-fov-slider-hdr-calibration-and-more-says-bethesda">finally committed to adding it</a> in a future update.

With Disney Dreamlight Valley's early access exit right around the corner, developer Gameloft has detailed some of the new features it'll be getting as part of its full release on 5th December and beyond - including a first look at its free multiplayer mode and the recently announced A Rift in Time paid story expansion.
</p><p>
Starting with the free stuff, Dreamlight Valley's next content update launches 5th December to coincide with its full release, bringing the "biggest amount of fixes and improvements so far", alongside the addition of The Nightmare Before Christmas' Jack Skellington as a new villager with his own friendship quests and rewards.
</p><p>
More significantly, it'll introduce the multiplayer ValleyVerse feature, enabling friends to visit each other's villages - where, alongside the usu

Mysterious zombie MMO The Day Before will now launch on 7th December, developer Fntastic has said, and be released on Steam as an early access game initially priced $39.

The Day Before had been slated to arrive next week, on 10th November, following a rollercoaster ride to release in which Fntastic was forced to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-day-before-dev-insists-zombie-mmo-is-not-a-scam-following-latest-delay">deny the game was simply a scam</a>, and fight off a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-day-before-developer-addresses-trademark-dispute-promises-steam-page-will-be-reinstated-soon">bizarre trademark dispute over the game's name</a> - which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-day-before-beta-coming-as-developer-re-emerges-following-calendar-app-kerfuffle">cont

If you've already explored Grounded's garden to the fullest (I haven't, despite my best efforts, because it turns out I don't entirely love man-sized spiders bearing down on me without warning), here's a little something you might be interested in: developer Obisdian is releasing a free update on 13th November giving players the creative tools to build backyards of their own.

Make It or Break It, as the new update is known, introduces a new Playgrounds mode where players can either muck around with the backyard featured in the story campaign or create one from the ground up, using an empty sandbox as a starting point.

Sanguivore: Twenty Below, a brand new dark and bloody co-operative horror game, will enter Steam and Epic early access next month.
</p><p>
Described as an "escape-town" experience, it traps players in a sequence of escape room challenges that gradually expand in size and difficulty from a single room to much larger areas.
</p><p>
All the while players will need to run from the Sanguivore - "freakish abominations with a hunger for your flesh and blood". Yikes.

## Thirsty Suitors review - skating and relationships get a queer, horny, exaggerated remix

Dating can be weird and fun and messy and really, really boring, and sometimes, if you want to look at things selfishly, it can be extremely insightful. Your personal borders budge up against someone else's - sometimes a stranger's - and as you uncomfortably try to co-exist in the same space, those borders squeeze and squash and are rejigged. Basically, you change, for better and for worse. And in a delightful effort to capture that process, Thirsty Suitors inherits both the thrilling highs and scary lows of the dating world, also for better and worse.
</p><p>
The main hereditary trait that pops to my mind is the messiness, though. Thirsty Suitors can be loosely described as a queer, South Asian-inspired, and significantly hornier version of Persona. Put simply: it's a turn-based RPG that involves lots of running aro

Now the sixth and final wave will be available from 9th November.

</p><p>
As usual, the wave will include eight courses split into two new cups, taken from past games as well as mobile game Mario Kart Tour. Four new characters will also be added.

The new voice of Wario - or at least, the person behind his grumpy moustachioed mouth in WarioWare: Move It! - looks to be Kevin Afghani, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/internet-briefly-thinks-its-identified-marios-new-voice-actor-until-he-says-no">the actor also cast as the new voices of both Mario and Luigi</a>.
</p><p>
It's not a huge surprise to see Aghani taking on Wario as well, as this role was one of the four major Mario voices all performed by the legendary Charles Martinet, alongside Mario, Luigi and Waluigi. 
</p><p>
Afghani's role as Wario looks to be confirmed within the WarioWare: Move It! credits, where he's listed as the game's principal performer. (In a typically oddball touch, we can also see his favourite food listed alongside his name: it's sushi).

I stand (and with WarioWare: Move It! you really do need to stand) with arms outstretched. My fists are clenched, and I have correctly assumed the game's "Choo Choo" position - like I'm going to mime the movement of a chuffing steam train. My body is ready. But as I rapidly yank my fists towards me, again and again until the time runs out, the drawers stay put. And this, sadly, happens relatively often.</p><p>Move It! is Nintendo's latest collection of typically excellent and extremely bizarre microgame ideas, served at breakneck speed. As always, you have only seconds to work out what is going on, what you're being asked to do next, and then react to actually do the thing yourself.

Shenmue creator Yu Suzuki has discussed the possibility of a fourth game in the series, and the idea of developing it as a more approachable prequel, similar to Yakuza 0.

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shenmue-3-review-a-faithful-follow-up-to-an-all-time-classic">Shenmue 3</a> was released in 2019, 18 years after the second game, but was aimed predominantly at fans of the series who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shenmue-3-dev-declares-usd7-1m-crowdfunding-total">backed the project on Kickstarter</a>.

Because of the shortened season length - believed to last only until the start of December - the game's next battle pass will feature just 50 levels (half of the normal 100), <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteLeaks/comments/17l3o63/full_og_battle_pass_via_fnbrintel/">leaks</a> have revealed.

The battle pass will be filled with character skins that are mash-ups of previous Fortnite favourites, such as Peely the banana man mixed up with ice cream mascot Lil' Whip - for a new skin named Lil' Split.
