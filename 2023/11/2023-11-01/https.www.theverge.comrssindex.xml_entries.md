  <p id="vsiujk">Microsoft is adding new gestures to the OneNote Windows app to improve the text and inking experience. If you have a device with a stylus, like Microsoft’s Surface tablets, you <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/what-s-new-and-what-s-coming-to-onenote-on-windows/ba-p/3966645">can now use more gestures</a> to manipulate your digital handwriting. Microsoft has added the ability to strike-through text, delete it by scribbling over it, and even quickly insert a new paragraph.</p>

  <p id="2stq0n">Not all Google searches make Google money. Google often says that it only shows ads on about 20 percent of queries, the ones it calls “commercial queries.” You can probably guess what qualifies. “US president in 1836” is not something you type when you’re about to buy something; neither is “facebook” because all you’re looking for is Facebook. But if you type in “best new car 2023” or “cheap flights to London” there are a lot of advertisers that would like to be the first thing you see, and there’s a lot of money for Google to be made in the process.</p>
