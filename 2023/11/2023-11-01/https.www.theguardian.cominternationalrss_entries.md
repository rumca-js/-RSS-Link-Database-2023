After two matches in four days, Tony Gustavsson’s side showed on Wednesday evening how tiredness can bring them down a notch or two. The frustration of not being able to penetrate Taiwan’s defensive block was evident on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/31/sam-kerr-ballon-dor-feminin-award-second-place-matildas-australia-chelsea-player">Sam Kerr’s</a> face as one after another of her attempts hit the goalkeeper or missed its mark.

<p>Cage leads a strong cast into the wilderness in an adaptation of John Williams’ punishing novel that cannot quite convey the full horror of its events</p><p>John Williams’s punishing 1960 western novel Butcher’s Crossing was described by Bret Easton Ellis as “a precursor to what <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/14/cormac-mccarthy-obituary">Cormac McCarthy</a> would do with the genre”. It follows Will Andrews, a dreamy 23-year-old Harvard dropout, as he tags along with Miller, a buffalo hunter targeting hidden valleys in the Colorado territory in the late 19th century. Will hopes to learn “more about this country”; what he gets, as the four-man crew shoots and hacks its way through dwindling herds in ever more treacherous conditions, is a lesson in remorseless brutality.

<p>Creatures Inc pulls back the curtain on the specially commissioned artists and dedicated team of testers behind their trading card game phenomenon</p><p>This year in the Japanese city of Yokohama the streets were paved with gold – in the form of giant Pokémon cards. From rare holographics on glass palisades to a Pikachu card the size of a small garden to tiled floors covered with common creatures, the city’s interconnected malls paid tribute to the Pokémon trading card game, while the world’s best players went head to head at the Pacifico convention centre at the annual world championships.</p><p>Nine billion of these cards have been produced to date, 21% of those since 2021, sold in 76 countries and 13 different languages. They were so popular in 00s playgrounds that they were often banned from schools – a phenomenon that’s repeating itself now, after the cards enjoyed a pandemic boost courtesy of bored kids and nostalgic millennials.
