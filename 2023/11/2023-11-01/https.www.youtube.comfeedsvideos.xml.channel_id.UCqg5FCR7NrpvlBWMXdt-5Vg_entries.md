This week on Breakout, we're talking all about the recent layoffs, which we believe indicates the live-service bubble has truly burst.

Featuring Nick Calandra, Marty Sliva, and KC Nwosu, the freeform podcast dives into a bit of our daily lives, the latest games, movies, tv shows and books, the occasional craft beer review and random topics we find interesting.
