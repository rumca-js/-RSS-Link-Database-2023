<p>If you’re reading this guide, you probably already know you want a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-robot-vacuums-130010426.html">robot vacuum</a>. But, perhaps after checking out their prices, you’re wondering if you can get one without draining your bank account. The answer is yes, you can indeed buy a decent robot vacuum without dropping upwards of $1,000. Just a few years ago, there weren’t a ton of solid yet affordable robot vacuums out there. But now, there have never been more budget robot vacuum options to choose from. After testing dozens of robot vacuums at all price points, we’ve decided that anything that’s $300 or less is what we’d consider to be cheap in this space. Here’s everything you need to know before purchasing a robot vacuum while sticking to a budget, plus our top picks.</p>

<p>Roli was an early poster child for the emergence of MPE (MIDI Polyphonic Expression). The company has had its share of struggles over the last 10 years, but it's still out there trying to spread the gospel of MPE. Its first product after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/musical-instrument-company-roli-files-for-administration-relaunches-as-luminary-073636314.html">filling for administration</a> in the UK (kind of like bankruptcy) and rebranding as Luminary Roli was a redesigned version of its Seaboard Rise. It's a flagship, pro-level MIDI controller, with a price to match ($1,399). The new <a href="http://roli.com/products/blocks/seaboard-block-m">Seaboard Block M</a> takes the company's signature squishy, continuous keyboard and puts it in a much more affordable and portable package.</p>

<p>Formula 1 may do its preseason tests right before the new schedule of races begins, but Formula E holds its trials months before the first E-Prix.

<p>If you ask Psync Labs, it’ll tell you the problem with smart security cameras is that they don’t know what they’re seeing. Those motion pings you get with other products? Defined by how light shifts in front of its sensor, treating an approaching figure or low-flying bird with equal alarm. So, Psync’s focus is to improve machine vision, but to also go one step further and pair this vision with GPT-enabled generative AI to help it, and you, understand what it can see. Its first product, the <a href="https://psynclabs.com/products/psync-camera-genie-s">Genie S</a>, is a security camera that’ll send you a written description of what (it thinks) is going on.</p>
<p>On paper, the Genie S has a similar feature set to plenty of other affordable home security units I could mention. There’s a powered pan-tilt base, five megapixel camera (outputting 2K Video), four LEDs, a microphone and speaker. But there are differences, like the fact it’s in the shape of a cube that, when it’s not activa

<p>Your EV may go a long way between charges, but can it carry dozens of passengers? GreenPower can boast both of those things with its latest electric school bus called &quot;Mega Beast,&quot; it announced in a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/product-launch-greenpower-unveils-the-mega-beast-all-electric-type-d-school-bus-with-the-longest-range-and-biggest-battery-pack-on-the-market-301972010.html">press release</a> spotted by <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/10/31/electric-school-bus-300-mile-range/"><em>Electrek</em></a>.
