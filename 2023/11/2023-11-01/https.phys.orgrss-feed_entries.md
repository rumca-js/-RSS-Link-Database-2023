Landing stably is a precondition for exploring a small celestial body in situ. The surface of a small celestial body frequently has weak gravity and is irregular, and the surface environment is unknown and uncertain. The landing mechanism tends to rebound and turn over, and the landing stability time is long. However, while most landing performance research has focused on lunar landing, there are differences between the surfaces of the moon and Mars.

In Alaska's largest river delta, tundra that has been scorched by wildfire, is still emitting more methane than the rest of the landscape long after the flames died, scientists have found. The potent greenhouse gas can originate from decomposing carbon stored in permafrost for thousands of years. Its release could accelerate climate warming and lead to more frequent wildfires in the tundra, where blazes have been historically rare.

Demons today are characterized in horror movies like "The Ring," "The Conjuring," and "The Exorcist" as paranormal entities—supernaturally powerful beings, with little relevance in reality. But in the medieval period, demons were ever-present. Specifically in medieval Europe, demons bedeviled communities, shocked religious leaders, and puzzled doctors.

Heavy precipitation, wind storms, heat waves—when severe weather events such as these occur they are frequently attributed to a wavy jet stream. The jet stream is a powerful air current in the upper troposphere that balances the pressure gradient and Coriolis forces. It is still not known whether the jet stream is really undergoing changes at decadal timescales and, if so, to what extent.

The birth of spatiotemporal mode-locking (STML) can date back to the report of Wright and colleagues in 2017. Following this breakthrough, research on STML has thrived. However, our comprehension and control of spatiotemporal dissipative solitons (STDSs) and STML in multi-mode fiber (MMF) lasers are not as mature as those in single-mode fiber lasers.

Social media can incubate communities that are so resilient that even banning them from the platform cannot destroy them. Michele Starnini and colleagues studied two online communities on the social media site Reddit: the far-right conspiracy theory subreddit "GreatAwakening," which was banned in 2018, and the hate-speech subreddit "FatPeopleHate," banned in 2015. Both communities decided among themselves to move to Voat, an unmoderated Reddit clone designed to serve those banned by Reddit.

Large-scale sky surveys are set to revolutionize astronomy. Observatories such as Vera Rubin and others will allow astronomers to observe how the sky changes on the scale of days, not weeks or months. They will be able to capture transient events such as supernovae in their earliest stages and will discover near-Earth asteroids we have missed in the past. At the same time, the rise of satellite constellations such as Starlink threatens to overwhelm these surveys with light pollution and could threaten their ability to succeed.

For centuries, naturalists have puzzled over what might constitute the head of a sea star, commonly called a "starfish." When looking at a worm, or a fish, it's clear which end is the head and which is the tail. But with their five identical arms—any of which can take the lead in propelling sea stars across the seabed—it's been anybody's guess how to determine the front end of the organism from the back. This unusual body plan has led many to conclude that sea stars perhaps don't have a head at all.

Are western U.S. forests threatened so much by failing post-fire tree regeneration that extensive forest loss may occur by mid-century? Increasing temperatures are drying forests, more fires are being ignited, and they are increasingly burning at high severity, killing 70% or more of trees. High-severity fires leave behind post-fire openings that climate change is making hotter and drier; these spaces are often dominated by competitive shrubs and have substantial area that is distant from surviving trees that provide essential seed for tree regeneration.
