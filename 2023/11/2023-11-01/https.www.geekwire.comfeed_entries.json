The release schedule has been huge since January, from the Resident Evil 4 remake to a new Legend of Zelda to Starfield, Baldur&#8217;s Gate III, Spider-Man 2, and Alan Wake 2. The flip side, however, is that it\u2019s been an absolutely brutal year for the people who make video games. Bellevue, Wash.-based game developer Bungie this week laid off approximately 8% of its overall staff, which reportedly followed a significant drop in players and revenue for its online shooter Destiny 2.
