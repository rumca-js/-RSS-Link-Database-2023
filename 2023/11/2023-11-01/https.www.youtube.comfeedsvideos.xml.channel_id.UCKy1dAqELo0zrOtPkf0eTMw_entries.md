Iron Man and Black Widow have been nothing more than a memory, mourned by the remaining Avengers since we last saw them in 2019’s Endgame. But it seems Marvel Studios might be thinking about resurrecting the dead, potentially bringing back the characters made famous by Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlett Johanssen in the #MCU. According to a new report from Variety, #MarvelStudios has been kicking around the idea of assembling the original team for an upcoming Avengers movie, which would involve breathing new life into both Iron Man and Black Widow. In more Marvel news, the executives over at Marvel actually considered swapping out Jonathan Majors’ Kang for Doctor Doom. And finally, in even more Marvel news: Mahershala Ali almost left the Blade reboot film due to various concerns he had with the script. According to Variety, the script apparently had the title character, Blade, in the backseat as it was written to be led by three female characters.

## RoboCop: Rogue City Review

RoboCop: Rogue City reviewed by Justin Koreis on PlayStation 5. Also available on Xbox Series X/S and PC.
RoboCop: Rogue City is a pitch-perfect throwback to the action movies of the ‘80s. It’s over-the-top violence with charm, largely well put together but rough on the edges. Most importantly, it's a fun way to spend time in a beloved fictional universe that doesn’t overstay its welcome. Blasting at goons as an unstoppable walking machine remains as extremely entertaining as it seemed on the big screen, thanks in part to an impressive commitment to capturing the look and feel of the original film. Mixing in elements like routine police work and side quests does a great job changing the pace, too. Even if it’s not the best example of visual fidelity, and prone to some bugs along the way, that love of RoboCop shines through. This is a solid B movie of a video game, which is exactly what the source material demands.

WarioWare: Move It! reviewed by Travis Northup on Nintendo Switch.

"WarioWare: Move It! is another amusing entry in one of the goofiest series Nintendo has, with wonderfully original multiplayer modes saving the day after the microgame playlist quickly starts to feel tedious. Even with motion controls occasionally not being able to keep up with your actions, the uber-creative ways Move It! finds to make you perform unspeakably silly acts is truly something to behold."

In today's Daily Fix:
It's (almost) a new month, and that means new Game Pass games. The service will be adding more titles as part of November's Wave 1, including Wild Hearts, Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Changed His Name, Headbangers: Rhythm Royale, Jusant, and more. In other news, Remedy has confirmed that the remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2 are ready for production, which is typically the longest stage of game development. But that's good news for fans of the series, as the titles are now one major step closer to release. Remedy also provided updates on Control 2 and its spin-off game, Condor, but don't expect to see anything of those titles any time soon. And finally, Nintendo added a few more retro games to its Switch Online library, included Castlevania Legends, Devil World, and Murasama Castle. Might be a fun time for a Halloween retro gaming session.
