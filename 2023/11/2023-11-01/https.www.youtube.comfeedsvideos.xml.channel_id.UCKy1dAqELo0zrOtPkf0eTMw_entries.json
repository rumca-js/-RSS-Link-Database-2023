But it seems Marvel Studios might be thinking about resurrecting the dead, potentially bringing back the characters made famous by Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlett Johanssen in the #MCU. According to a new report from Variety, #MarvelStudios has been kicking around the idea of assembling the original team for an upcoming Avengers movie, which would involve breathing new life into both Iron Man and Black Widow. In more Marvel news, the executives over at Marvel actually considered swapping out Jonathan Majors\u2019 Kang for Doctor Doom. And finally, in even more Marvel news: Mahershala Ali almost left the Blade reboot film due to various concerns he had with the script. According to Variety, the script apparently had the title character, Blade, in the backseat as it was written to be led by three female characters.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cYQJrW_gD0", "date_published": "2023-11-01T23:19:34+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Ign - YouTube", "album": "Ign - YouTube", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/5cYQJrW_gD0/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes - Official Clip (2023) Rachel Zegler, Tom Blyth", "description": "Witness the beginning of the Games in the new clip \"Run\" from The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7vEtIwTdVM", "date_published": "2023-11-01T21:00:04+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Ign - YouTube", "album": "Ign - YouTube", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/A7vEtIwTdVM/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Extra Life: IGN Cares x Kinda Funny Charity Livestream", "description": "In the greatest assembling of any kind since all of our favorite Marvel heroes in Avengers: Endgame, IGN Cares and Kinda Funny are officially uniting for a fully day of Extra Life charity goodness that will be as meaningful as it will be wonderfully chaotic.\nTune in on Friday, November 3 as IGN and Kinda Funny  face in games like Street Fighter 6, WWE 2K23, and even Kinda Feudy, all for a good cause!

Also available on Xbox Series X/S and PC.\nRoboCop: Rogue City is a pitch-perfect throwback to the action movies of the \u201880s. It\u2019s over-the-top violence with charm, largely well put together but rough on the edges. Most importantly, it's a fun way to spend time in a beloved fictional universe that doesn\u2019t overstay its welcome. Blasting at goons as an unstoppable walking machine remains as extremely entertaining as it seemed on the big screen, thanks in part to an impressive commitment to capturing the look and feel of the original film. Mixing in elements like routine police work and side quests does a great job changing the pace, too. Even if it\u2019s not the best example of visual fidelity, and prone to some bugs along the way, that love of RoboCop shines through.
