		U.S. network broadcaster CBS says its news division will create a deepfake-detection unit. The move is part of a growing realization among TV networks that their raison d'être is under attack.

Faked celebrity porn got a lot of headlines a few years ago, but anyone who studies biometrics has <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202303/deepfakes-get-more-attention-but-code-keeps-getting-more-dangerous">known</a> the real threat <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202005/nato-gets-soothing-message-about-deepfakes-but">for much longer</a>. CBS is sharing very little about its project, including how fraudulent video will be identified by humans or algorithms.

		The government of Armenia is still unclear when it will be possible for citizens to obtain biometric passports without long queues and obstacles.

The country is in the process of procuring a new system for issuing biometric passports and ID cards which is due to be completed through a public-private partnership (PPP). Right now, however, it is still unclear which company will be chosen and how long it will take to technically implement the system, Armen Ghazaryan, head of the Migration Service, said on Monday at the National Assembly of Armenia.

Ghazaryan added that the country's passport system has been lacking investment for years.

“The fact that this system has survived so far with a minimal investment was thanks to the enthusiasm of the employees," he said, <a
