Doors are motifs for adventure that have been used over and over again. </p> <p>", "link": "https://www.eurogamer.net/five-of-the-best-doors", "date_published": "2023-11-08T12:07:35+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Eurogamer.net Latest Articles Feed", "album": "Eurogamer.net Latest Articles Feed", "user": null, "language": "en-gb", "thumbnail": null, "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.eurogamer.net/feed", "title": "Mass Effect modders present dozens of new projects for N7 Day", "description": "<img src=\"https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/VD0vudN.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp\" /> <p>\nBioWare's new Mass Effect game may still be several years away, but fans of the stellar sci-fi franchise are working hard to provide new playable content for the series' Mass Effect Legendary Edition trilogy package much sooner, in the form of mods. \n</p><p>\nAs is now tradition, a showcase featuring many of these mods - some available now, some still in development - has been released to commemorate the franchise's annual N7 Day celebrations. \n</p><p>\nYou can watch that all below, as - with thanks to the modders behind each project and those who have put together the showcase - Eurogamer is able to highlight some of the many promising projects fans have to look forward to.\n</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-modders-present-dozens-of-new-projects-for-n7-day\">Read more</a></p>", "link": "https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-modders-present-dozens-of-new-projects-for-n7-day", "date_published": "2023-11-08T11:07:21+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Eurogamer.net Latest Articles Feed", "album": "Eurogamer.net Latest Articles Feed", "user": null, "language": "en-gb", "thumbnail": null, "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.eurogamer.net/feed", "title": "Tintin developer apologises, says game is not \"the experience as we intended\"", "description": "<img src=\"https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/tintin-3.jpeg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp\" /> <p>Tintin Reporter: Cigars of the Pharaoh developer Pendulo Studios has said is it committed to fixing the game \"in the coming weeks\" after admitting it is not the \"experience as we intended it to be\" at launch.</p><p>Cigars of the Pharaoh quietly launched yesterday on PC, PlayStation and Xbox and adapts the early Tintin comic book of the same name.</p><p><a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2125090/Tintin_Reporter__Cigars_of_the_Pharaoh/#app_reviews_hash\">Player reviews</a> on Steam so far are mixed, with most mentioning gameplay bugs, visual glitches, and terrible AI.
