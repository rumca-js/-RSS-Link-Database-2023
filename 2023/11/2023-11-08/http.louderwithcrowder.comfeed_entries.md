Across all of America, really. But it's worse on college campuses. Congress attempted to hold a hearing on Wednesday to discuss why that is. Before the first witness got to speak, it was interrupted by pro-Hamas protestors.</p><p>It's become increasingly clear the mistake the January 6th protesters made was an organized rally. They should have just snuck into a hearing because it's apparently easy to do. Though in fairness, it's Washington DC, and it's our government. There is causing a disruption, and then there is causing a (D)isruption.</p><p>Seriously, look at this photo. The only people NOT pro-Hamas protestors are the hearing witnesses.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-r
