Tired of having to explain yourself every time your friends catch you firing up Hosiery Party: Wet Potato Frenzy on Steam? Well, there's some good news: Valve is reportedly readying a feature that'll let you mark specific games as "private" so you can hide your more unusual tastes from other users while still maintaining a public profile.
</p><p>
At present, Steam's privacy settings don't support the kind of granularity needed to hide individual games, only enabling users to dictate broad categories - game details, friends list, inventory, screenshots, and workshop items - to keep discrete.
</p><p>
As <a href="https://x.com/thexpaw/status/1722176195603689860?s=20">spotted by SteamDB creator Pavel Djundik</a>, however (<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/valve-is-working-on-a-new-steam-feature-that-will-let-you-hide-all-those-weird-sex-

As part of its latest earnings call, Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav has outlined the company's plans to transform its biggest gaming franchises from traditional console and PC releases into "always on" live service games.
</p><p>
Zaslav made the comments during his opening remarks to investors, in which referred to several of the company's franchises - Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, Batman, and Mortal Kombat - as $1bn gaming properties. Developer NetherRealm's Mortal Kombat 1, he noted, has sold nearly 3m copies since launching in mid-September this year.
</p><p>
"Our focus," he continued, "is on transforming our biggest franchises from largely console and PC based with three-four year release schedules to include more always on gameplay through live services, multiplatform and free-to-play extensions, with the goal to have

As reports of a Switch successor continue to build momentum, despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-addresses-switch-2-reports-denies-it-has-briefed-developers">carefully phrased rebuffs</a> from Nintendo, the Mario maker has said it'll continue to release titles for its current console "without being bound by the traditional concept of the platform lifecycle."

Nintendo made the statement (<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/11/08/nintendo-hints-it-will-continue-extensive-switch-support-even-after-new-gen">thanks GameInformer</a>) as part of its latest earnings report - in which it also confirmed Switch sales have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-sales-pass-132m-as-nintendo-stays-silent-on-successor">now surpassed 132m units</a> - writing, "Switch will be entering its eighth y

Time Splitters developer Free Radical is reportedly the latest team to be affected by Embracer Group's sweeping restructuring programme, with the studio said to be facing closure.
</p><p>
Free Radical's history is a long one and complicated one; the studio was founded in 1999 by a number of ex-Rare developers, and quickly made a name for itself with the much-loved TimeSplitters FPS series. In 2009, after several difficult years, it was acquired by Crytek, becoming Crytek UK, who then sold it to Deep Silver in 2014, where it became Dambuster Studios - the developer behind this year's Dead Island 2. However, Deep Silver then announced it was forming a new Free Radical in May 2021, specifically to make brand-new TimeSplitters, with original studio co-founders St

Chucky the doll will be the next Killer added to hit multiplayer horror Dead by Daylight.

</p><p>
Fans quickly speculated Chucky was on the way, and now we know they were right - he'll be added in the next chapter on 28th November. Check out the trailer below.

Finally those moves are beginning to pay dividends for Apple's much more popular iOS and iPad OS devices as well, with the port of RE Village for iPhone 15 Pro and M1 and M2-based iPad models. </p><p>This port promises the full-fat game experience, somehow delivered on a device that can fit in the palm of your hand. Today we'll be evaluating Village on the brand new iPhone 15 Pro, to see just how well this beautiful console and PC showcase translates to a pocketable gadget. Is this a genuinely good experience, or do the mobile concessions simply cut too deep? </p><p>I'd be remiss if I didn't emphasise how amazing Resident Evil

The latest in the Marvel Cinematic Universe superhero franchise is set for release later this week, with DaCosta admitting to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-marvels-director-used-final-fantasy-vii-advent-children-as-a-reference-when-pitching">IGN</a> the Square Enix film was used as a reference for "a couple of scenes".

"It's just an amazing, amazing movie, and has really great fight scenes and has a really great ending sequence with the main character being thrown into the sky by all the other characters," she said of Advent Children.
