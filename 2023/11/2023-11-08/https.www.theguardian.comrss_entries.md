<p>The census isn’t broke and needs no fixing. So why do officials want it scrapped?</p><p>Let us start with a quiz question. A British tradition dating back more than two centuries faces abolition, even though it is both hugely popular and highly valuable to policymakers and researchers.

Ever since 1801, a register of the population has been taken every 10 years – the only interruption being in 1941 – yet we may have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/03/out-for-the-count-has-britain-already-conducted-its-last-census">conducted our last</a>.

<p>It is misguided to claim that marching to stop a war on a day that marks the end of another war is disrespectful</p><p>Traditionally, here is what happens when Armistice Day falls on a Saturday. Millions observe a two-minute silence at 11am to remember the fallen. Life otherwise continues as it always does. Football grounds are crammed with cheering fans, pubs and clubs are packed with intoxicated revellers, high streets abound with bargain hunters. In short, an average Saturday, sprinkled with standard doses of cavorting, laziness and idle pleasures.</p><p>None of these activities had been considered an insulting lack of respect for Armistice Day. But a new exception has suddenly been invented, ad hoc, by those seeking to ban this <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/05/dowden-concerns-about-pro-palestine-marches-armistice-day">Saturday’s protest</a> against Israel’s blood-soaked onslaught in Gaza.

Its director, Joe Pearlman, brings together hours of behind-the-scenes archival footage, much of it never seen by Williams, and screens it to him on his laptop for his response.</p><p>One of the more harrowing clips is a video diary recorded by Williams in 2007. It shows him apparently alone, drug-addled and reading online commentary aloud. “‘Robbie Williams is music for people who don’t feel’,” he says, his face grey, eyes sunken. “‘Rob is a showbiz cha

While Manchester City, the reigning champions, are motoring through Group G as smoothly as a Red Bull race car negotiating a particularly tricky hairpin, United’s progress has looked more like that of a clown car clunking and spluttering its way around the Big Top. They lost their opening game against Bayern Munich by the odd goal of seven and their second by the odd goal of five against Galatasaray before arresting their poor by scraping past Copenhagen at Old Trafford thanks to some late goalkeeping heroics from André Onana.</

An incendiary century from Ben Stokes helped brush aside the Netherlands for a 160-run victory in Pune that lifted Jos Buttler’s men off the bottom of the World Cup table - not that the dyke didn’t threaten to once again burst along the way.<br /><br />Could England sink any lower against one of the Low Countries? It was the question being asked before this basement battle and for an hour it looked eminently possible. Batting first after winning the toss, a hideous, self-inflicted collapse turned 133 for one from 20 overs into a troubling 192 for six by the 36th, with Buttler, a captain looking increasingly bereft, among those adding to England’s hall of sham

<p><strong>Shepherd’s Bush Empire, London<br /></strong>Flashy dad-dancing music mogul Diddy and growling south London rapper Giggs energise the crowd with a relentless string of hits and guests</p><p>If you’d have predicted 15 years ago that Peckham’s Giggs and US rap mogul Diddy would one day share a stage in Shepherd’s Bush, you might have received some strange looks. Road-rap legend Giggs half-talks quintessentially British bars (“Walk in the party sporting Armani / half of the crowd’s all snorting my charlie”) sounding like someone who smokes 40 a day while driving through south London drizzle. Diddy, meanwhile, is all exuberance and flashy catchphrases, the shiny suit-wearing personality that helped launch the careers of everyone from Mary J Blige to the Notorious BIG.</p><p>Yet UK rap’s ascent to the mainstream is such that it feels natural for them to share a stage. “We could have done an arena, but we wanted it to be intimate and a real party, bruv,” reveals Giggs to the ado

<p>The 85-year-old has fought for his place as an artist, capturing the complexities of the Black experience on canvas, in ways that provoke and inspire</p><p>At 85 years of age, Arvie Smith is arguably in his finest form ever. The artist retired from teaching in 2014, which allowed him focus on his art full-time, and after that followed a 2017 Governor’s Art Award from the state of Oregon, a 2018 honorary doctorate from his alma mater, the Pacific Northwest School of Art, and a showing at the 2022 Venice Biennale. Now he is taking on New York: Smith recently exhibited in the US art capital for the first time as a part of the Art Dealers Association of America’s annual art show. “I’m flexing my muscles for sure,” he said, while discussing his work during a break in the action. “I want to engage and create a dialogue with the audience, a dialogue about the experience of Black people, the Black experience.”</p><p>True to those intentions, Smith’s painting draws deeply on his experience

Branagh is, of course, a trained Shakespearean actor, although he hasn’t performed on stage in eight years.

It’s an exciting, fast-paced watch that puts it at the top of its genre</p><p>Culprits is the latest heist thriller to land on a streaming service. This one is from J Blakeson, who previously dabbled with high-octane amorality in the hugely enjoyable 2020 film <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/feb/18/i-care-a-lot-review-rosamund-pike-amazon-prime-video">I Care a Lot</a>.

It lasted more than 24 hours and ended up in an emergency caesarean. When the nurse brought her to me from the surgery room, I thought to myself, “Am I supposed to hold this baby now?” It was the first time I had held a baby. Most of my friends and relatives have kids, many of them were teenagers at that point, but somehow I had managed to never hold a baby. It wasn’t by chance: I’ve never liked them and had always felt afraid of having my own.</p><p>I have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/aug/13/why-do-men-suffer-depression-in-silence">lived with depression</a> since I was a teenager.

<p>Generosity, warmth and joie de vivre characterise this collection of the great poet’s letters</p><p>If letter writing is an art form, then <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/seamusheaney" title="">Seamus Heaney</a> was one of its master practitioners. Christopher Reid’s 800-page selection from what he assures us was an “enormous output” – “I have had to cut back severely to make a book of publishable proportions” – is a trove of delights as much as it is a literary testament.</p><p>Heaney was as fluent in prose as he was sublime in verse, as readers will know from his essays and articles, and his extensive memoir, Stepping Stones, compiled in interview form with the poet Dennis O’Driscoll. Yet the style in the letters, many of them obviously composed at breakneck speed, is astonishing in its quality and unflagging grace. As one of his correspondents said of Heaney: “He makes the simplest words shine.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/nov/08/the-letters-o

One day, the lion king was frightened by a roaring noise in the forest, which the jackals knew was the voice of a runaway bull, nothing for a lion to be scared of. They visited the bull and persuaded him to come before the lion and declare his friendship. The bull was scared of the lion, but he agreed, and so the lion king and the bull became friends, and the jackals were promoted to the first rank by the grateful monarch.</p><p>Unfortunately, the lion and the bull began to spend so much time lost in conversation that the l

Julian Borger reports</p><p>For <strong>Issa Amro, </strong>Hebron has always been home. He was born there and has made his life in the industrial Palestinian city in the West Bank.

It would have bobbed up, a YouTube link in a group chat or a thread of replies. It might have been a compilation of Damien Martyn drives with the frame inverted to make him a left-hander. A collection of Steve Waugh run outs.

Most often the title would be true. From a meticulous archive of every cricket match televised in Australia for 40 years, an archive that began purely as a personal hobby, he edited and loaded thousands of hours of
