The quirky pixel art is now in HD and multiplayer finally has lobbies and a proper server browser.

The fights never really feel satisfying, and a complete waste of time at worst.

It will feature the developer's gameplay vision as players enter New Fortune City to scavenge materials and battle the undead. There will be new content in the coming months, but what does the game offer besides the initially billed MMO survival gameplay?\n\nHere are ten things you should know about The Day Before, from its core gameplay loop and what Woodberry colony is to how long early access will last and whether your system can handle it.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj9FOoOBWPk", "date_published": "2023-11-08T14:00:38+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/oj9FOoOBWPk/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Top 15 PS5 Games With Stunning GRAPHICS [2023 Edition]", "description": "Sony continues to enjoy tremendous success with the PS5.
