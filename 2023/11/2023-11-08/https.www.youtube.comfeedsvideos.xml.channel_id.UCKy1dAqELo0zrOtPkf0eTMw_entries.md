## Ayaneo Kun Review

The Ayaneo Kun has the Steam Deck in its sights. With its dual trackpads and big 8.4-inch screen, the visual resemblance is unmistakable, but this generation’s newer hardware, a class-leading 54 watt TDP, and a massive 75 watt hour battery make it one of the most powerful Windows gaming handhelds on the market today. At $999 to start, it’s surprisingly close to other Ayaneo models but pricey enough that you’ll want to think carefully about the features you want from a handheld gaming PC.

In today's Daily Fix:
Nintendo has announced they're (finally) making a movie based on The Legend of Zelda. It'll be live-action, and, get this, co-financed and distributed by Sony. While Sony's movie division and games division are separate, it's still pretty wild that Nintendo and Sony would team up for anything. In other news, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is getting review bombed, but it's not even the right Modern Warfare 3. Yes, the original game from more than 10 years ago is taking a hit for its younger version because angry gamers apparently can't be bothered to pay attention to what they're leaving angry reviews about. And finally, the plot of a new Silent Hill game has been leaked, and Konami hasn't even confirmed its existence.
