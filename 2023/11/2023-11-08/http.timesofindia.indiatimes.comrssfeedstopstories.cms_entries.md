The Bihar government has decided to increase the job reservation for marginalized communities from 50% to 65% based on the Bihar Caste Survey Report. This increase, along with a 10% quota for economically weaker sections, brings the total quota in Bihar to 75%. The new quota allocation is based on the population proportion of each group, with 20% for Scheduled Castes, 2% for Scheduled Tribes, and 43% for backward classes and extremely backward classes. This move by the government is supported by the caste-based headcount and aims to fend off legal challenges.
