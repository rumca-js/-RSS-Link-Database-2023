Now that I have a better understanding of the project itself, I put together a proper project management laying out what needs to get done for the MVP. That'll launch privately with a handful of beta testers, then once any high priority bugs and issues are fixed, I'll launch the Dev Notes platform to the masses! Getting the PM done also means a lot more coding in my future and the future of this series!! I'm stoked!
Documenting the business side of things and my thoughts about it are also very important to me, so I've shared my goals for the next quarter and loose goals for 2024. These will change with time given the amount of unknown variables, but it gives me a goal to chase for now.
