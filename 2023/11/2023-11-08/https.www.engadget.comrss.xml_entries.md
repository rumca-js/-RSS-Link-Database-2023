<p>There's a moment, a little over a minute into the <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://youtu.be/NnKPP8fTlc4">announce video</a>, where <a href="https://www.hologramelectronics.com/chroma-console">Chroma Console</a> finally starts to make sense. Up until that point it seems like a really excellent, but rather straightforward multi-effect pedal. And if you're familiar with <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/hologram-electronics-microcosm-guitar-effect-pedal-review-ambient-music-170002707.html">Hologram Electronics</a> at all, you know the company doesn't really do "straightforward."</p>

<p>You'll soon be able to use the one-app streaming experience Disney is creating between Disney+ and Hulu. <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disneys-fiscal-full-year-and-q4-2023-earnings-results-webcast/">On today's earnings call</a>, CEO Bob Iger announced that the beta version of Hulu on Disney+ will be available in December. The full launch is expected in early spring, though Iger cautioned the company may not see the full benefits of the one-stop shop until 2025. The beta version will allow parents to setup profiles and content controls to ensure viewing remains age appropriate. Disney says a key reason for the beta is to give parents time to do this setup since the library of Hulu content significantly adds to the streaming options.</p>
<p>Disney <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-and-hulu-will-merge-into-a-single-app-later-this-year-083536664.html">announced in May</a> that it planned to bring Hulu content into Disney+ before the end of 2023. The company has been

<p>Depending on the hardware you're using, training a large language model of any significant size can take weeks, months, even years to complete. That's no way to do business — nobody has the electricity and time to be waiting that long. On Wednesday, NVIDIA unveiled the newest iteration of its Eos supercomputer, one powered by more than 10,000 H100 Tensor Core GPUs and capable of training a 175 billion-parameter GPT-3 model on 1 billion tokens in under four minutes. That's three times faster than the previous benchmark on the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/resources/mlperf-benchmarks/">MLPerf AI industry standard</a>, which NVIDIA set just six months ago.</p>
<p>Eos represents an enormous amount of compute.

<p>Amazon Prime subscribers now have access to a deeply discounted <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/one-medical-amazon-prime-benefit">One Medical</a> membership for primary care services. The company announced today that Prime members can sign up for just $99 a year, or $9 per month. A One Medical membership typically costs $199 annually. In addition to the individual plan, Prime members who sign up for One Medical can add up to five other people for $6 each.</p>

## The best docking stations for laptops in 2023

<p>Chances are your new laptop has fewer ports than you’d like. For years, companies have been prioritizing thinness and lightness to the detriment of connectivity options. Docking stations give you back some of that versatility — and then some — by combining monitor, Ethernet, USB and other ports into one package. Unlike simple USB hubs, docking stations tend to have more slots and usually incorporate a DC power supply, making them bigger and far less portable than small hubs. But that also means they can be the connective matrix of sorts that powers your home office setup. Ultimately, which dock works best for you depends on what you need to connect, but it’s safe to say the vast sea of choices out there can be overwhelming. We tested out 12 options from brands we trust to see which are worth your money.</p>
<h2>What to look for in a docking station</h2>
<p>First and foremost, consider what you need to plug in. This will likely be the deciding factor when you go to actually buy a d

<p>OpenAI’s extremely popular ChatGPT service was down and non-functional for its 100 million weekly active users. The service went down just before 9AM ET. OpenAI <a href="https://status.openai.com/">has acknowledged the outage</a> and said that it’s also impacting the company’s API services. However, the service was restored at around 10:50 AM ET.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of a working platform, ChatGPT users were greeted with a warning message that says it's “at capacity right now.” OpenAI wrote in an error report that it had “identified an issue resulting in high error rates across the API and ChatGPT, and we are working on remediation.” All told, the outage lasted around two hours.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The services were also impacted for a few hours last night, but this was just a partial outage that didn’t impact all users.

<p>A new feature in WhatsApp will let you hide your IP address from whoever you call using the app. Knowing someone’s IP address can reveal a lot of personal information such as their location and internet service provider, so having the option to hide it is a major privacy win. “This new feature provides an additional layer of privacy and security geared towards our most privacy-conscious users,” WhatsApp wrote in a <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://faq.whatsapp.com/2635108359972899/__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!ARSIw1dzm6rXR0bDF3VAy0qciWUaJO1Pad5FowYD7TWBG_UqtR9QBF9XxH9U43QTaYCXsuYjMu-4DrWd3g$">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>WhatsApp currently relays calls either through its own servers or by establishing a direct connection called peer-to-peer with whoever you are calling depending on network conditions. Peer-to-peer calls often provide better voice quality, but require both devices to know each other’s IP addresses.</p>

<p>Mosseri also shared an image of how the feature will work. The option will live under the Privacy and Safety tab, accessible by clicking on the person's name from inside the chat. From there, a section will appear called &quot;Who can see your activity.&quot; Just switch the toggle below and all views moving forward should then become private.

<p>Reportedly, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) would “secure AI scans” for Schedule F performers — union members earning more than $32,000 per TV episode or $60,000 per film. Studios would pay once to scan the likenesses of these performers without paying for their use or re-use — essentially giving them eternal rights to their face after paying once upfront

But Google (de facto leader of the charge) and other mobile operators are now leveraging the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/european-union-digital-markets-services-acts-131818075.html">European Union's Digital Market Act</a> (DMA), according to the <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/ec2ec699-a91c-4389-b1a9-ae06dca836d5"><em>Financial Times</em></a>.

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-reportedly-wont-make-its-ai-advertising-tools-available-to-political-marketers-010659679.html">Meta</a> will require advertisers to disclose whether the ads they submit for its websites have been digitally altered, including through the use of AI tools, if they're political or social in nature. Ads that have been digitally altered will be marked as such on Meta's platforms, in the same way some advertisements come with a &quot;Paid for&quot; disclaimer. The company will start implementing the rule in the new year, just as the campaign period for what's expected to be a brutal and divisive 2024 US presidential elections heats up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gpa/blog/political-ads-ai-disclosure-policy">blog post</a>, Meta explained that advertisers have to disclose in the advertising flow if they submit a social issue, electoral or political ad with photorealistic images or videos — or one with realistic sounding audio —

The feature is now available in beta on Google's Performance Max advertising product, allowing US advertisers to create and scale text and image assets for campaigns using AI, the company announced in a <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/get-creative-with-generative-ai-in-performance-max/">blog post</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Performance Max is already an AI-powered product that works across multiple Google products including Youtube, search, display and others. It optimizes ads by analyzing performance data, and the new feature supplements that by using AI to assist in asset creation as well. As Google puts it, the features will allow advertisers to quickly create high-quali

<p>Many Pixel owners have been left with a bad taste in their mouths after it took Google over a month to fix a serious bug, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/android-14-patches-ransomware-storage-bug-but-some-users-will-lose-data/?comments=1&amp;comments-page=1"><em>Ars Technica</em></a> has reported. It first appeared with the launch of Android 14 back on October 8th, locking some users with multiple accounts out of their device's local storage. It affects multiple devices ranging from the Pixel 4 to the Pixel 8, and for many users, it was akin to being locked out of their phone by ransomware.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some folks were unable to unlock their devices, while others were able to boot up but had no access to lock storage. However, the bug rendered some phones completely unusable, as they would continuously bootloop and never reach the home screen. Reports of the issue appeared shortly after Android 14 launched, but Google kept rolling out the buggy release and only ac
