I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of Michigan 1920s, Discover the vibrant life of the local population, the bustle of downtown, the Harley-Davidson bikers in competition and the heroism of the firefighters.


Video Restoration Process:
âœ” FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
âœ” Image resolution boosted up to HD 
âœ” Improved video sharpness and brightness 
âœ” Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
âœ”added sound design only for the ambiance
âœ”restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 
âœ” Face Restoration
âœ” added modern Noise grain for a natural result. 


Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
