In this video Iâ€™m going to attempt to camp in my Tesla model X for 24hours with out setting foot outside the car. the challenge is Can I sleep, cook, eat and even using the bathroom all without leaving the car? Also coincidentally tonight a huge storm is hitting the UK with winds up to 100 miles an hour so I have no idea what is going to happen.
