</p><p>After two sold-out shows at London's Royal Albert Hall, Video Games in Concert is set to tour the UK next summer, stopping off in Brighton, Liverpool, Wolverhampton, Manchester, and Bournemouth. Sadly, there are no dates outside of England at this time. 
</p><p>"Video Games in Concert is a critically acclaimed concert series that features one of the world&rsquo;s premier composers of video games scores, E&iacute;mear Noone, who is responsible for some of the most enduring soundscapes on World of Warcraft and other best-selling video games," a press release says.

## The PS5 Slim is "not that much smaller" than its chunkier sibling, according to this new teardown video

</p><p>Dave2D has provided a detailed teardown of the brand-new console system, showing off the machine's trimmer stature and the console's new outer cover, which now boasts a half matte, half gloss finish. This means any panels bought for the original system cannot be used on the updated one, as it essentially has four separate pieces. 
</p><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, Dave2D made specific mention of the weight difference. Whilst the original version weighs in at either 3.9kg or 3.3kg, depending upon whether or not you have the digital version or the system with the disc drive, the new models weighs 3.2kg or 2.6kg respectively.

</p><p>As tracked by <a href="https://fortnite.gg/player-count">Fortnite.gg</a>, the return of Fortnite's original map &ndash; dubbed Fortnite OG by developer Epic &ndash; has seen an influx of players, with the battle royale mode itself also breaking records when it hit a new high of 3,109,888 simultaneous players yesterday, too.
</p><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, then, Epic has had to keep a close eye on server health and capacity, warning players that they may "experience a short queue" before logging in at peak times.

## Alan Wake 2: a deep dive into Remedy's high-end ray tracing

Alan Wake 2 is sublime - a masterclass in the visual arts - and while it still manages to look fine on consoles from Xbox Series S upwards, it's with high-end PC that you get to see Remedy's masterpiece at its absolute best thanks to hardware-accelerated ray tracing, path tracing and DLSS 3.5 ray reconstruction. The question is: do you need best-of-the-best hardware like RTX 4080 or RTX 4090 to benefit from the experience? Well, it's a demanding experience to be sure, but we were happy with the results we gleaned from RTX 3080 and its nearest 40-series equivalent, RTX 4070, both running at 1440p output resolution. And of course, those settings can and will provide similar scalability on other RT-capable GPUs, though your mileage may vary.
</p><p>
There's scalability then, but let's kick off by taking a look at the individual RT features

</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/world-of-warcraft-xbox-consoles-blizzard/">GamesRadar</a> at BlizzCon 2023, vice president and executive producer for World of Warcraft Holly Longdale said that whilst the team was currently focussed on the "three expansions" for now, being part of Microsoft's extended family means the team talks about making the game available on other platforms "all the time".
</p><p>World of Warcraft was released way back in 2004 &ndash; which means we're just months away from the MMORPG's twentieth anniversary &ndash; and has only been playable on PC for all that time.
