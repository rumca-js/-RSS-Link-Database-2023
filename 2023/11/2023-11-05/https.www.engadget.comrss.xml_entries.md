<p>Discord is changing its approach to file hosting in an effort to crack down on malware. The platform will begin using temporary file links that will expire after 24 hours for user content shared outside of Discord, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/discord-will-switch-to-temporary-file-links-to-block-malware-delivery/"><em><ins>BleepingComputer</ins></em></a> reported. The change is expected to go into effect by the end of the year.</p>
<p>While the stated intention of the move is to crack down on malware, it’ll also curb the wider use of Discord as an unofficial file hosting service. It’s not uncommon for users to upload images and other content to their own servers and then post those links elsewhere. You won’t be able to do that as smoothly anymore once it makes the move away from permanent file links, because the links will go dead after a day. Nothing will change for content posted and shared within Discord itself.</p>

<p><em>Fortnite</em> players are definitely here for the new throwback season. Since the release of “<a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-og-drop-back-into-battle-royale-chapter-1"><ins>Fortnite OG</ins></a>” at the end of last week, public player counts have reached new all-time highs, according to trackers like <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://fortnite.gg/player-count"><ins>Fortnite.gg</ins></a> — peaking on Saturday with over 6.1 million concurrent players. With Chapter 4 Season 5, or “Fortnite OG,” <em>Fortnite</em> is dipping back into its Chapter 1 glory days to bring players back to the original 2018 island map and reintroduce gear and other elements from its past.</p>
<p>The season started with an update designed around Chapter 1 Season 5, and subsequent updates will pull from other phases of the game’s history. But, it’s only expected to run for about a month, and players aren’t wasting any time getting in on the battle royale a

## How the meandering legal definition of 'fair use' cost us Napster but gave us Spotify

<p>The internet's "<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/">enshittification</a>," as veteran journalist and privacy advocate Cory Doctorow<strong>&nbsp;</strong>describes it,  began decades before TikTok made the scene. Elder millennials remember the good old days of Napster — followed by the much worse old days of Napster being sued into oblivion along with Grokster and the rest of the P2P sharing ecosystem, until we were left with a handful of label-approved, catalog-sterilized streaming platforms like Pandora and Spotify. Three cheers for corporate copyright litigation.</p>
