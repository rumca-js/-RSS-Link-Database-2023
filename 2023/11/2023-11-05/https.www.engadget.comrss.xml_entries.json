The platform will begin using temporary file links that will expire after 24 hours for user content shared outside of Discord, <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/discord-will-switch-to-temporary-file-links-to-block-malware-delivery/\"><em><ins>BleepingComputer</ins></em></a> reported. The change is expected to go into effect by the end of the year.</p>\n<p>While the stated intention of the move is to crack down on malware, it\u2019ll also curb the wider use of Discord as an unofficial file hosting service. It\u2019s not uncommon for users to upload images and other content to their own servers and then post those links elsewhere. You won\u2019t be able to do that as smoothly anymore once it makes the move away from permanent file links, because the links will go dead after a day. Nothing will change for content posted and shared within Discord itself.</p>\n<span id=", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/discord-is-switching-to-expiring-links-for-files-shared-off-platform-202533531.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-11-05T20:25:33+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Engadget", "album": "Engadget", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null, "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Fornite keeps breaking player count records since releasing its nostalgic OG season", "description": "<p><em>Fortnite</em> players are definitely here for the new throwback season.
