<p><strong>Finborough Theatre, London<br /></strong>The third play in this programme of work by Scotland’s first major modern female playwright redeems an otherwise underpowered evening</p><p>The first two plays in Ena Lamont Stewart’s revived trilogy seem peculiarly underdeveloped and creaking period pieces. Towards Evening, which premiered in Edinburgh in 1973, features a middle-aged brother (Robert Hands) and sister (Janette Foggo) who rub each other up the wrong way in a late-night encounter. He is cultured, pompous and feels smothered by her. She is resentful of being looked down on by him. It is rich in ideas but the dialogue is clunky: they speak in backstory, explaining their characters to one another.</p><p>The second, Walkies Time for a Black Poodle, is more complex but still led unsubtly by its issues. An insecure mistress of the house (Joanne Gallagher, convincingly rough around the edges) who has been made newly rich through marriage is in conversation with a domestic se

<p>Salt, AKA sodium chloride, has been used to preserve food and enhance flavours for thousands of years. Can it really be a health hazard?</p><p>“The cure for anything is salt,” says a character in Karen Blixen’s short story The Deluge at Norderney. “Sweat, tears, or the sea.” But while there’s a lot to commend a long run, a little cry or a pensive look at the wide blue ocean, everyday life has got a lot saltier since Blixen’s era – and salt is no longer the cure-all it once was. So what should we be doing about it?</p><p>First things first: the World Health Organization recommends capping your salt intake at 5g a day, and keeping it even lower if possible. That’s because, according to a <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/339/bmj.b4567">large body</a> <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/9/1970">of evidence</a>, ingesting a lot of it<strong> </strong>is linked to high blood pressure, which in turn is a risk factor for heart disease and stroke.

Indeed, it has been suggested that the human species started playing games as a safe space for experimenting with the best way to plan a strategy to get to our goals in life.</p><p>As soon as we began to realise that the universe was governed by rules, we started to create games to explore those rules. Many animals play games when they are young, but our species is probably unique in continuing to play games into adulthood.

<p>The Open City author traces a grieving teacher’s itinerant life in an enlightening autofictional novel sometimes hampered by its earnestness</p><p>Reporting from the Gaza Strip in 2006, the critic and essayist John Berger powerfully summed up the prevailing sentiment among suffering Palestinians: “How is it I am still alive? I’ll tell you I’m alive because there’s a temporary shortage of death. This is said with a grin, which is on the far side of a longing for normalcy, for an ordinary life.”</p><p>The Nigerian-American writer and photographer <a href="https://www.tejucole.com/">Teju Cole</a> has written about Berger’s influence on his work, and his own novels seem touchingly attuned to the deaths that punctuate our longing for normality, to the phantom absences in ordinary lives.

A silky leek pie and crunchy, soft-textured biscuits to lift the spirits<p>From now until early spring, leeks will have a permanent presence in this kitchen, fat green and white alliums to blend with potatoes for soup or simmered in chicken and barley stews. They will be mashed into purées for pasta and fried for filling a baked potato. Cooked slowly and softened without colour, they will fill open-faced tarts of goat’s cheese or bacon.</p><p>The first fat leeks of the year went into a pie this week, cooked until silky, their flesh seasoned with grated parmesan, then wrapped in pastry and baked. Another time, I might be tempted to add chopped leaves of tarragon or a smattering of blue cheese, a spoonful of mustard or a dusting of smoked paprika. On this occasion, it was simply leeks and cheese, a partnership that ticks every box for me.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/nov/05/nigel-slater-recipes-for-leek-and-parmesan-pie-and-peanut-butter-cookies">Continue reading.

It’s a disorienting cross between a Los Angeles hotel lobby, the place where everyone over 30 gets killed in <em>Logan’s Run</em> and the headquarters of Hydra ™ ®.

<p>A bad injury and the death of her much-loved grandfather left Marianne Eloise afraid to get back on her board. Here, she reveals how a weekend skate retreat helped her to move on and learn some new tricks</p><p>On the first day of a skateboarding retreat in the Sussex countryside, a 23-year-old with no fear of death turns to me and asks, “Isn’t that what skateboarding is? Nearly getting your teeth taken out and coming back for more?” We’ve just watched a passing child (almost) take a board to the face – twice – before asking to have a go. That dance, of getting hurt, but getting back up, is at the heart of the sport. It takes a particular kind of determination to take hits at the rate skateboarders do and get back up, and I’m here to find that stupid fearlessness inside myself again.</p><p>The setting is serene: deer run past, birds chirp, bugs rustle in the trees.

<p>Exfoliators can be harsh and uncompromising, but a new generation of scrubs will gently remove a top layer of dead cells. Just remember to go easy</p><p>As someone who has championed liquid exfoliators for years, I’ll admit there is still something really satisfying about using a face scrub. The process of mechanically working a textured exfoliator in circular motions around your skin in the hope you will buff away dead cells to reveal its glowier, brighter, more youthful counterpart – there’s nothing like it. Until recently, however, you wouldn’t catch any beauty editor worth their mettle recommending facial scrubs. The formulations were brutal and the textures were equally harsh – they were literally ripping into the skin, causing further issues. And then, to top it off, they were also damaging the environment.

I’m not worth it!” And she is here now, looking like a Modigliani portrait of Brigitte Bardot, talking about the dog shit she stepped in when leaving her house and how this morning has fundamentally destabilised her because she is usually insanely early. Fretting generously and hilariously, she rises to begin an interpretive apology dance and I am in a kind of heaven.

Reports found that the Thai and Filipino women were treated like merchandise by the adverts<p>‘Tired of pampered, cold, uptight Yank females? Then try our beautiful passionate senoritas.’ An American ad set the misogynistic and seedily exploitative tone of a ‘modern form of serfdom, if not of slavery’ when the <em>Observer</em> investigated mail-order brides on 20 September 1987. Thai and Filipino women (‘attractive and unsophisticated coffee-coloured ladies’, another advert leered) were treated like merchandise in ‘any other import/export deal’, briskly bought and sold.</p><p>In the Philippines, where 70% of the population lived in poverty, the draw of being able to offer their family a better life made these uneasy matches an economic prospect women struggled to refuse. That the westerner ‘with the Hawaiian shirt and the bulging wallet’ might turn out to be ‘a night-shift factory hand living with his parents in a bleak part of the Midlands urban sprawl’ could come as an unpleasant

<p>Israeli bombs hit school being used as a shelter while warning comes that children form 40% of fatalities</p><p>The UN has warned of a “catastrophic” situation for children in Gaza, as Israeli bombs hit a school being used as a shelter and landed outside a hospital, and Israel came under mounting pressure over the civilian suffering caused by its campaign.</p><p>More than 40% of the dead in Gaza after nearly four weeks of war were children, the UN said, with 3,900 reported child victims, and another 1,250 missing and presumed buried under bombed buildings. With little rescue machinery, and hospitals overcrowded and running out of supplies, the chances of survival for those trapped in rubble are painfully low.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/05/gazas-children-face-catastrophe-as-death-toll-nears-4000-un-warns">Continue reading...</a>
