<p>Sevilla’s director of football on the Argentinian, replacing Monchi, his friends at Aston Villa and facing Arsenal in Champions League</p><p>Víctor Orta has an idea. The former director of football at Leeds and Middlesbrough, who returned this summer to Sevilla after eight years in England, has heard the debate so many times, listened to the arguments that often, that he couldn’t help his mind wandering.</p><p>Now, he reckons, he might have come up with a way of settling it, until next season at least. To have a lot of fun trying, at least. He has barely sat down when he throws it out there, a hint of mischief. “What’s better? La Liga or the Premier League?” he says. “How about something like a Ryder Cup of football to find out?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/05/victor-orta-people-said-i-was-crazy-to-bring-bielsa-to-the-championship">Continue reading...</a>

Carlo Ancelotti’s side are on 29 points, two behind unexpected leaders who won 4-2 at Osasuna on Saturday. Third-place Barcelona have 27 points.</p><p>The hosts dominated from the start at the Bernabéu but could not score despite piling on the pressure and recording 22 shots. Rayo Vallecano produced a strong defensive display led by their goalkeeper Stole Dimitrievski, who kept out efforts from Federico Valverde and Joselu in the first half. Vinícius Júnior thought he had given Real the lead in the 66th minute, but saw his effort ruled out for an offside earlier in the move.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/05/european-roundup-rayo-vallecano-hold-

And yet the latest batch of songs from London-based trio Nina Cristante, Jezmi Tarik Fehmi and Sam Fenton doesn’t feel like any great progression. Their reference points remain mid-1990s alt-rock (Blonde Redhead; Pavement without the playfulness) and 1980s Cure – with a flash of the heavy-lidded introspection of early xx on the track Que Suprise. And once again the three band members trade vocal lines within songs, a nice touch that gives the ly

He is brutally murdered by his wife, Clytemnestra, in furious revenge for his having ritually sacrificed their daughter Iphigenia on the eve of conflict to placate the gods.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/05/in-middle-east-as-in-greek-tragedy-justice-must-prevail-over-moral-absolutism">Continue reading...</a>

Palermo’s most deluxe hotels were completely occupied by Japanese celebrants. The seating of the grand Politeama theatre was rearranged so that his 1,400 guests could also dine and dance. The opera house, Teatro Massimo, was closed for a private performance of <em>Don Giovanni</em>, with Riccardo Muti conducting.</p><p>These pharaonic festivities caused consternation and controversy because Sicily is all about beguiling simplicity. There’s immense panache to the island, of course, but it’s sometimes at the spit-and-sawdust end of the spectrum. So Sicilians perceived something profoundly inauthentic, even unfair, about tho
