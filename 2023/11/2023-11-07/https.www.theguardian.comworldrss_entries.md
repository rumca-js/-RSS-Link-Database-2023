<p>New PEN America data reveals incarcerated persons are being robbed of magazines and even recipe books</p><p>Reading bans are rising at an alarming rate in prisons across the country, with new PEN America data revealing that those incarcerated are being robbed of the occasional magazine and even recipe books on how to make ramen.</p><p>For almost 22 years, Zeke Caligiuri subscribed to the New Yorker magazine from prison in Minnesota. He was meant to receive 52 annual issues but claimed during his sentencing to have never gotten the full amount. Instead, a non-delivery notice with vague wording would arrive at the prison post room, sometimes flagging an advertisement that was deemed inappropriate or just one article in an issue of many. After searching for information about what he couldn’t read, Caligiuri would sink into a period of overwhelming defeat.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/07/us-prison-books-magazines-ban-high-rate">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Today’s king’s speech will be Rishi Sunak’s first as PM, and King Charles’s first as king</p><p>Good morning. Today’s king’s speech will be Rishi Sunak’s first as PM, and King Charles’s first as king. Charles can be reasonably confident that it won’t be his last.</p><p>It is routine to describe this as one of Sunak’s big reset opportunities, along with his party conference speech and the autumn statement. But this is not really true. The state opening of parliament is a big ceremonial moment, and a useful summary of the legislation that might be passed in the next 12 months, but there is no evidence of a king or queen’s speech ever “shifting the dial” in party political polling, in the way that a good or bad budget can. (Margaret Thatcher was largely brought down by the poll tax, but the shift did not happen when it was mentioned in the Queen’s speech.) The speech is also not particularly reliable as a guide to the big political decisions that might be taken over the next year. Tw
