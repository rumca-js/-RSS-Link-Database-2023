Still doubtless beaming from the runaway success of this year's Super Mario Bros. movie, Shigeru Miyamoto has confirmed a live-action The Legend of Zelda movie is in the works.
</p><p>
Details are sparse at present, but Miyamoto, announcing the news <a href="https://twitter.com/Nintendo/status/1722011980129779795?s=20">on Nintendo Japan's Twitter/X account</a>, said the project has already been in development for "many years now". As per an <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2023/231108.html">accompanying press release</a>, Miyamoto will produce the movie - which is being co-financed by Nintendo and Sony Pictures Entertainment - with Avi Arad, responsible for "many hit films", also producing.
</p><p>
Arad's films, if you're wondering, are primarily, but not exclusively, within the superior

Revenant Hill, the next game from Night in the Woods co-creators Bethany Hockenberry and Scott Benson and the first project from their new studio The Glory Society, has been cancelled amid "serious health issues" impacting several members of the team.
</p><p>
Revenant Hill was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/night-in-the-woods-co-creators-reveal-next-game-revenant-hill">officially unveiled back in May</a>, teasing an adventure, set in the year 1919, that would follow Twigs the cat's attempts to make ends meet after an "owl from the next hill" began demanding she pay rent on her wet log near an abandoned graveyard.
</p><p>
There were hints of systems reminiscent of farming sims, with crops to be grown and a community to be built as the seasons passed, albeit with a cast of witches, demons, and ghosts, and more serious conside

Crunchyroll, the popular <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-completes-usd1bn-crunchyroll-buyout">Sony-owned</a> anime streaming service, is doing a Netflix and offering mobile games as part of its subscriptions starting today, 7th November.
</p><p>
Game Vault, as the new offering is officially known, is only available Crunchyroll members who subscribe to the streaming service's Mega Fan or Ultimate Fan tiers. The former costs &pound;5.99/$9.99 USD a month, while the latter is a US-only addition, priced at $14.99 USD.

Developer Red Hook Studios has announced a first paid DLC pack for its acclaimed horror sequel Darkest Dungeon 2. It's called The Binding Blade and will introduce two new heroes - one who'll be familiar to fans of the first game - when it arrives in December.
</p><p>
Darkest Dungeon 2 left early access back in May this year, taking players on a grim Lovecraftian road trip that Eurogamer contributor Edwin Evans-Thirlwell called a "copious and often brilliant, if not quite unmissable reworking of a powerfully grim fantasy" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/darkest-dungeon-2-a-lovecraftian-roadtrip-rpg-of-thrilling-and-suffocating-intricacy">Recommended review</a>.

BioWare has celebrated this year's annual Mass Effect celebrations with a blog post that hints at Mass Effect 5's title - and suggests fans will get answers to their burning questions concerning what happened after Mass Effect 3's ending.
</p><p>
It's unclear, however, whether this means these are coming in Mass Effect 5 - still several years away - or sooner, as part of N7 Day itself.
</p><p>
"We've asked ourselves many of the same questions you've asked us over the years!" Mass Effect boss Mike Gamble <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/mass-effect/mass-effect-legendary-edition/news/n7-day-2023">wrote</a>. "What happened to everyone you know and love in the games?

Ubisoft Montreal is the latest company hit by ongoing cuts as 75 members of staff have been laid off at the Canadian studio.
</p><p>
As reported by <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-far-cry-ubisoft-montreal-layoffs-1850998477">Kotaku</a>, the staff cuts come as part of a "reorganisation" of the studio's general and administrative teams, Ubisoft IT, and its SFX studio Hybride (which worked on Disney Plus Star Wars series The Mandalorian).
</p><p>
In a notice to the government of Quebec, the company said: "Ubisoft is proceeding with a collective dismissal in its Montreal establishment within the framework of a reorganisation of its production support services across Canada, by consolidating these functions Canada wide, Ubisoft will be able to optimise its resources to be more sustainable in the long term."

Nintendo has said that reports detailing the company's actions briefing external game developers on Switch 2 are "untrue". 
</p><p>
During an investor briefing held today following the company's latest quarterly financial results, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa issued a blanket denial to address a swathe of reports that have mapped out the company's progress towards launching its inevitable Switch successor. 
</p><p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-demoed-switch-2-to-developers-at-gamescom">Nintendo showcased Switch 2 hardware capabilities to game developers in August</a> around Gamescom in Cologne, Eurogamer reported at the time. Demos included a souped-up version of the original Switch launch title Zelda: Breath of the Wild, meant to show off the Switch 2's improved technical capabilities.

Lords of the Fallen developer Hexworks has laid out its 2023 roadmap for the Soulslike.
</p><p>
A number of free content additions are in development, but perhaps most intriguing is a new questline event - presumably to extend the core storyline.
</p><p>
The plan also includes ongoing weekly enhancements, including stability, performance, save game fixes, multiplayer improvements, balancing, increased boss difficulty, and other quality of life tweaks.

Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/modern-warfare-3-players-are-not-happy-with-its-short-campaign">short campaign may be getting mixed feedback</a>, but it does at least feature a cameo appearance from the series' best canine boy.

Fans have found that there's a pettable dog (of course) featured during the game's Trojan Horse mission, which you are encouraged to go stroke while attempting to blend into the level's crowds. 
</p><p>
Linger on and continue looking at said dog after petting it and its name will soon pop up: Riley, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/colin-it-now-infinity-ward-insists-the-call-of-duty-dog-is-named-riley">lovable German Shepherd who served as a squad member in Call of Duty Ghosts</a>.

Stranger Things has returned to Dead by Daylight.

The chapter, based on the Netflix series, includes The Demogorgon as a Killer, Nancy and Steve as Survivors, and the Underground Complex Map.
</p><p>
The game's developer Behaviour Interactive pulled this content from the game back in November 2021 due to an expiration of its licensing agreement with Netflix.

Square Enix has reported a drop in profits, despite a boost from sales of its most recent Final Fantasy games. However, 2024 is likely to be a stronger year by comparison.
</p><p>
According to its latest financial report from April to September 2023, company operating income has dropped by 33 percent and ordinary income by 42 percent.
</p><p>
That's despite an increase in sales for its HD Games, owing to the releases of Final Fantasy 16 and the Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters.

Ubisoft has finally allowed you to explore Assassin's Creed Mirage without its chromatic aberration visual effect permanently switched on. 
</p><p>
An update for Mirage launches today for PC, PlayStation and Xbox which adds a toggle for the visual effect. There had been numerous fan complaints that it was simply too distracting, and many requests for it to be switched off or toned down.
</p><p>
You can download the update (version 1.0.5) from 1pm UK time and try the option for yourself. Download sizes for the update range from around 3 to 5GB, depending on platform.

A group of former BioWare testers plan to protest outside the company's Edmonton headquarters today, after being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-dragon-age-qa-staff-who-formed-union-laid-off">laid off from contract studio Keywords</a> last month.

13 former testers were employed by Keywords Studios but seconded to BioWare to work on 2021's brilliant Mass Effect Legendary Edition trilogy remaster.

What makes a rally game? Speed helps, as do puddles, and patches of muddy track. Long drifts are essential, and the thing has to look <em>right</em>. You want to thunder into woodland and over ice. The cars, with their glaring sponsorships, should resemble sculpted dollops of Colgate wrapped in Christmas lights - or futuristic toys. Oh, and those racks of headlamps, as if a vampire hunter were competing, are a must. With EA Sports WRC, Codemasters supplies all of this. Plus, the studio, constitutionally incapable of making a bad driving game, is now armed with the official World Rally Championship licence.
</p><p>
The new game centres on a career mode, in which you are assailed not only by curves of gravel-topped treachery, high in the mountains, but by the tight turnarounds of the calendar. You can only choose one activity per week:

The Epic Games Store still isn't profitable.
</p><p>
That's according to Epic Games Store boss Steve Allison, who was speaking during a court hearing on Monday. 
</p><p>
As reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/6/23949372/the-epic-games-store-still-isnt-profitable">The Verge</a>, the exec was talking during the current <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-trumpets-resounding-victory-in-epic-anti-trust-lawsuit-appeal">Epic vs Google court case</a>. Here, Allison said while the Epic Games Store still isn't profitable, the company's focus remains on "growth". Additionally, according to emails shared during the trial, Epic had hoped to claim half of all gaming revenue for PC games.

Nintendo's Switch console has now passed 132m units sold, but the company is remaining silent on its successor.
</p><p>
According to Nintendo's latest report detailing sales over the last financial quarter, Switch sales are still going strong. Unit sales for the Switch family of consoles rose 2.4 percent year-on-year, with the OLED model the most popular. A further 4.69m Switch OLEDs were sold, as clearly players are willing to spend extra on the improved screen, or to simply upgrade from the older model.
</p><p>
On a conference call after the earnings release, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa refused to comment on plans for a Switch successor, despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-demoed-switch-2-to-developers-at-gamescom">rumours of a 2024 release</a>.
