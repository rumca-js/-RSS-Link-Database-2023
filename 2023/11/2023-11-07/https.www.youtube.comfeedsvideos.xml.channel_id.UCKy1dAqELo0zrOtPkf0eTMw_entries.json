Also available on PlayStation 5 and PC.\n\n\"EA Sports WRC takes the class-leading feel of 2019\u2019s Dirt Rally 2.0 and stuffs it into an officially licensed World Rally Championship experience, like a steel rod in Timo Rautiainen\u2019s backside. Loose surface handling remains supreme, stages have been pumped up to 30 kilometre marathons, the audio is excellent, and the selection of modern and historical rally cars is achingly close to spot-on. However, just like a steel rod into your co-driver\u2019s buttocks, there have also been some unwelcome, performance-related side effects and some serious lost position in the graphics race with the competition. Stuttering and tearing are common while racing on Xbox Series X, and the fidelity here falls well short of being a generational leap from Dirt Rally 2.0.

Either way, there's always the possibility of smaller spin-off titles like 2020's Miles Morales starring any number of Spider-People. In other news, a developer with Naughty Dog confirmed there's still work going on for that Last of Us multiplayer game that was supposedly put on indefinite hold earlier this year. Maybe we'll finally see some gameplay soon? And finally, The Finals saw a huge open beta weekend, with more than seven million playing the latest free-to-play multiplayer shooter. Did you enjoy it?
