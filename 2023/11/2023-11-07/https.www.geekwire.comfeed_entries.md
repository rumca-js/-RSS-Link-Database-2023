Curious is targeting software companies producing annual recurring revenue between $500,000 to $5 million that are running out of cash or not meeting growth expectations for a future investment round. The firm&#8217;s thesis is drawn from Dumont&#8217;s experience operating startups backed by venture capital. &#8220;The venture model has somehow convinced us to take the most cost efficient businesses in history — software — and turn them into cash incinerators, all in the name of growth,&#8221; Dumont&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/seattle-firm-curious-raises-16m-to-buy-software-startups-running-out-of-money/">Read More</a>
