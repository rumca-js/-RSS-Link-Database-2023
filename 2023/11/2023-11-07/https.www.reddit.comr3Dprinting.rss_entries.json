When running the printer it is used with the wooden bottom plate and a low speed on the ventilation fan. This was added later as the original design was just as a fume hood with an open space at the bottom, but as you may have guessed, this caused too much of a draft when printing. This allows you to remove this piece and use the encloser as a fume hood for things like airbrushing with the fan speed on high where it creates significant negative pressure. The ventiltion fan is a cheap grow tent fan on a speed controller that vents to atmosphere and I also added lights and a camera to monitor prints.
