It couldn’t be more timely </p><p>A woman in labour wails and moans with effort, her body barely visible in her semi-darkened home, where she’s giving birth. Surrounded by her family, and filmed by artist Robina Rose in 1977, it feels intrusive to look. Nearby, another woman just screams and screams and screams again, her face filling a big screen. Gina Birch is screaming for the brief length of a Super 8 film cartridge. Filmed in 1977, the same year that Birch formed the band The Raincoats with Ana da Silva, her 3 Minute Scream is pure defiance, ending with something like a laugh. Screaming, like childbirth, is exhausting work. The amplified sound of both these films in the second room of Women in Revolt! leaks between spaces. It echoes and leads you on even as you are confronted with the first work in

This is Jack and Florence Kirk’s house in Wetwang, Humberside, where the nonagenarians are being visited by their grownup children Rob and Tina.

It is unique, heartwarming and reciprocal. A case in point: after a late goal sees Arsenal go 2-1 up against Manchester City on Sunday, the Gunners’ keeper Manuela Zinsberger turns around to ask fans how long is left. While this is the top tier of women’s football in England, Arsenal’s home ground Meadow Park is leased from fifth-tier men’s side Boreham Wood. For this game, it seems, the clock facing Zinsberger’s goal is either broken or hasn’t been turned on – it’s just a blank screen – so she has no way of knowing the time.

Within a year, he was moonlighting as the club’s bouncer. The year after, he quit his respectable day job to drive the group on tour across the country. And, when Beatlemania sent them around the world, Evans followed, carrying the g

<p>A knockout performance anchors a mostly charming fish-out-of-water comedy that has stayed a seasonal favorite ever since</p><p>The first rule in the Code of Elves is to “treat every day like Christmas”, and that, in a nutshell, is Will Ferrell’s comic style. At 6ft 3in, he’s almost always the tallest actor on screen yet his instinct is to play even bigger, with an ungainly exuberance that tends to set the tone for whatever scene he’s in. He’s a Bergdorf Goodman window display. He’s the neighbor who nearly kills himself every year hanging enough lights and gaudy holiday bric-a-brac around his house to slow traffic in the subdivision. He couldn’t fade back into the scenery if he tried – and, to his immense credit, he never, ever tries.</p><p>It’s not quite right to say he was born to play Buddy, an exuberant orphan raised in Santa’s workshop in Elf, because he was also the only conceivable person to play Ron Burgundy in Anchorman or Ricky Bobby in Talladega Nights.

<p>Billionaires say they are desperate to give away their money – but their interests are misaligned with society’s. Just tax them!</p><p>Almost exactly a year ago, Vox journalist Kelsey Piper was having a heart-to-heart with Sam Bankman-Fried. The “Crypto King” (people used to call him a lot of stupid things) had just declared bankruptcy, setting off a chain of events that last week ended in his conviction for multiple types of fraud. He has yet to be sentenced, but he faces a maximum term of 115 years, which is quite some override of the principle “avoid sending rich people to prison” laid down, I believe, by the founding fathers.</p><p>Against a backdrop in which Bankman-Fried has already been put bang to rights, and on the understanding that further critique of the young gentleman won’t give anyone their money back, I still can’t help circling one part of the Piper/Bankman-Fried exchange. “You don’t believe anyone is doing anything for good reasons,” Piper told him in a message.

Its location was the remote frozen village of Tulgas, 200 miles south of the Russian port of Arkhangelsk. Early that morning the enemy attacked. By lunchtime two men next to Scheu had been killed. The next day was worse. “Shells were just raining about. We knew we were in for a hit,” he wrote in his diary.</p><p>The soldiers bombarding Scheu’s platoon were Bolsheviks. The American crawled out and hid in a nearby building. Inside he found a wounded girl, her dead family and a decapitated priest. Canadian reinforcements scattered the attackers. Scheu heard about the armistice two months later. “It doesn’t mean a damn thing over here,” he observed bitterly. Also, he was having a good time back at base and m

<p>Sen-I Yu’s sympathetic and humane film traces three loosely woven stories of people dealing with loneliness and stress in New York City</p><p>To paraphrase a classic American crime film (and TV show), there are eight million stories in My Heavenly City, and this affecting film focuses on just a few of them. Director Sen-I Yu, has made a few shorts already but this is her first feature, and in some ways this plays like three short films loosely woven together. Still, all the components are strong and aesthetically cohesive, if verging on the sentimental. Each story revolves around immigrants, most of whom are originally from Taiwan, like the director herself. They are living in New York and dealing with the loneliness, stress and anxiety caused by the city itself as well as feelings prompted either by their estrangement from their families – or, as in the last story, proximity to family who moved to the city with them.</p><p>In the first chapter, 15th Street, depressed student Mavi

These venues take a traditional game – in this case shuffleboard – and revamp it with technology, striking design and a nightclub atmosphere.

<p>We lift the lid on one of Europe’s best value cities with a tour of old-school canteens, prize-winning communist blocks, and a bar with Jesus on a carpet</p><p>This year has been a good one for Vilnius. The Lithuanian capital celebrated its 700th birthday on 25 January 2023, and a few months later it was named the European Union’s green capital for 2025. Perhaps most symbolically – as Lithuania continues to firmly reject its Soviet past and align itself closer with the west – Vilnius played host to the Nato summit in July.</p><p>In short, there’s a lot for the Vilnese to be proud of and happy about. Given the progress the city has made since I first fell in love with it almost 10 years ago, local people want to share their joy and sense of accomplishment with visitors seeking a good time. The city even recently established a “<a href="https://baltics.news/2023/06/07/the-municipality-of-the-capital-will-establish-a-vilnius-night-office/">night office</a>” to ensure a night out is a
