Sometimes, it defies any conventional understanding. Glenn Maxwell has produced more moments like this than most. This one, though, in Mumbai on Tuesday night, was the apogee. More than a moment, a string of them. An extended sequence of impossibility, one after the other spiralling off into the floodlights and the smog and the endless jubilant roar, sweat and bewilderment and metallic adrenaline in an impressionist smear.</p><p>For decades, nobody made double hundreds in one-day cricket. Belinda Clark took one off the might of Denmark, the anomaly that proved the rule. Sachin Tendulkar got the first in the men’s game, creeping to the mark in 2010. Nine others have done it since, but all in the first innings, beating up a team from well on top. They were brillia

<p>Manchester City have qualified for the Champions League knockout stages for the 11th consecutive season after the most routine of European nights against Young Boys.</p><p>Nothing less was expected of City as the reigning kings of Europe breezed by the Swiss champions to extend their unbeaten home record to 28 in continental competition, this being their 26th victory in that run. The closest Young Boys got to the City net was when their fans threw a smoke bomb onto the pitch in the vicinity of the six-yard box, as they finished with no shots and one player fewer in what was a mismatch.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/07/manchester-city-young-boys-champions-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

For instance, in 2021 the race made headlines for including nonbinary runners, among the first to do so, and in 2022 the race worked to be more supportive of breastfeeding mothers, opening breastfeeding stations along the run route. The marathon route itself also showcases the diversity of the Big Apple, working its way through all five boroughs and showcasing many of the ethnic groups that call New York home.</p><p>The New-York Historical Society’s new exhibit, Running for Civil Rights, centers around two remarkable Black men who helped make the marathon the diverse marvel that it is today. The exhibition is an important tribute to Joseph Yancy, who founded the New York Pioneers Club in 1936, an organization integral in po

<p>Real-life retired Gurkha Ritesh Chams adds authenticity in the lead role, but the script brims with cliches and sentimentality </p><p>This tale of heroism and comrades in arms is getting a release in the UK to celebrate the legendarily fearless Gurkha soldiers from Nepal and north-east India, who have been closely allied with the British army. Indeed, lead actor Ritesh Chams is a real-life retired Gurkha who fought and was wounded in Afghanistan, which adds a tang of authenticity to his performance, as it does with several other of the cast who are also former soldiers. That said, director Milan Chams’s script, co-written with Giriraj Ghimire, is chock full of cliches and cornball sentimentality – which will possibly make this reassuringly familiar for its intended audience.</p><p>The opening framing has an elderly man in the present day laying flowers on 11 November at a mountaintop monument, paying his respects to ancestors and fallen soldiers. He explains to his grandchild that

I have asked around and many other people are doing the same.</p><p>I would normally consider it shocking to not know what is going on elsewhere in the world. We owe it to common humanity not to ignore inhumanity, wherever it occurs. We should listen and at least sympathise, even if to no concrete purpose.
