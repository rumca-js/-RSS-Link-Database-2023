<p>Not only has the show post been taken down from YouTube but the manifesto has been banned from all major platforms. </p>
<p>The Mayor of Nashville has also said he will launch an investigation. </p>
<p>“I have directed Wally Dietz, Metro’s Law Director, to initiate an investigation into how these images could have been released," Mayor Freddie O'Connell said in a <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/crime/2023/11/06/nashville-mayor-orders-probe-into-covenant-shooting-documents-release/71474603007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>, according to The Tennessean.

Otherwise, nothing the prosecution does will make sense to you. So pick one. </p>
<p>Well, there is however a third option to view this trial. That it is politically motivated and is a witch hunt. But that is definitely not the case here so just forget about that one. </p>
