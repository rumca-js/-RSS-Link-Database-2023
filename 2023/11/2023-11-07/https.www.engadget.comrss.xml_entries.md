<p>It's been rumored for years, but Nintendo still managed to surprise us with a late-day announcement: a live-action film based on The Legend of Zelda is in the works, directed by Wes Ball. Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto is producing the film along with Avi Arad, and the film is being co-financed by Nintendo and none other than Sony Pictures Entertainment. You know, part of the same company that owns PlayStation.</p>

<p>If your Apple Watch hasn't been holding its charge like it used to, it’s time to update to the latest version of watchOS. Earlier this month, several Apple Watch users noticed their batteries draining faster than usual after they installed watchOS 10.1. Of course, users took to social media to voice their observations and to make sure it wasn't an isolated happening. Later, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-battery-drain-issues-to-be-fixed-in-upcoming-watchos-update-090554269.html">Apple acknowledged the battery drain</a> issue and promised to release a fix -— which happened today with the latest version of watchOS. 10.1.1. Specifically, Apple says that the update "address an issue that could cause the battery to drain more quickly for some users."</p>
<p>Apple has come a long way with its software updates over the years. These days, most of Apple's updates are fairly stable but that doesn't mean they're immune to getting hit by the <a class="

<p>Sony has just unveiled its latest pro-oriented mirrorless camera, and we now know why it took them <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-03-sonys-a9-ii-mirrorless-camera-has-faster-smarter-autofocus.html">four years</a> to develop it The Alpha A9 III is the first full-frame camera on the market with a global stacked sensor, a sort of holy grail in the photographic world. It allows for some wild specs, like 120fps shooting speeds with no blackout, up to a 1/80,000th of a second shutter speed and zero rolling shutter — albeit with a 24.6 megapixel resolution that may disappoint some.</p>
<p>The new tech opens up a lot of new possibilities for photographers. Without the constraints of a physical shutter (no, there isn't one), it can shoot full-resolution, blackout-free 14-bit RAW bursts at up to 120fps with a 1.6 second buffer (around 180 shots). Sony also installed the latest Bionz XR image processor and &quot;high-density focal plane phase detection AF&quot; that allows for rea
