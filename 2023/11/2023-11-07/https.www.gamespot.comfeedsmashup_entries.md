The trailer, said to be the last one before the movie comes out, begins with a sequence where Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury gives a monologue about how heroes are an "old-fashioned notion," as the video cuts to images of Iron Man and Captain America.</p><p>But heroes are still needed, and that's where Brie Larson's Captain Marvel comes in. In The Marvels, she teams up with Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) and Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani) to fight against the evil Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton). The villain has torn a hole in space that causes a different reality to lead into their own.

<p>The best Charlotte build in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/genshin-impact/">Genshin Impact</a> will help you get the most out of this plucky reporter, and you’ll want to if you’re looking for another great Cryo support character. Charlotte is an interesting character that can dole out damage or heal, but she actually scales with her ATK stat in both cases, making her a bit more viable.</p><p>She’s a four-star character which means that she does have a few drawbacks. She deals rather low damage with normal attacks, but can dish out some decent Cryo damage using her skill, and in a wide area too. Aside from slightly lower numbers than a five-star would have, she’s also got a rather high energy requirement if you want to use her healing abilities, which are tied to her burst. She could well be worth it though, so here’s everything you need to know about the best Charlotte build, including artifacts, weapons, and teams.</p><h2>Best Charlotte Artifacts</h2><figure style="width

<p>As it does every three months when it releases a quarterly sales report, Nintendo has provided new sales numbers for the best-selling Switch games of all time. They're all Nintendo games, and there are pretty much no surprises on the list, which is led by Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.</p><p>Nintendo said the April release of The Super Mario Bros. Movie "positively impacted" sales of Mario games, including Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. The game sold an impressive 3.22 million units during the six-month period between April and September, boosting its lifetime haul to 57.01 million copies. This includes copies sold in hardware bundles, but it's an impressive number all the same. For comparison, Red Dead Redemption II and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt have sold 50 million copies each.</p><p>For the past three months alone, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe saw the biggest quarterly growth in unit sales, rising by 1.55 million from 54.46 million units sold through the end of June 2023.

<p>The Nintendo Switch has further solidified its position as the second-best-selling Nintendo console of all time, as the company reported that sales of the hybrid gaming system had reached 132.46 million units sold as of September 2023. That makes the Switch the third-best-selling console of all time and it's just 21 million sales shy of toppling the record set by the DS family of handheld consoles. Sony's PlayStation 2 still seems secure in the top spot--for now--as its 155 million lifetime sales record has remained unbroken for many years.</p><p>For the six months ending on September 30, 2023, <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/index.html">Nintendo posted</a> an operating profit of $1.9 billion.

<p dir="ltr">Hunting vampires isn't for the faint of heart.

<p>Napoleon Bonaparte is one of history's most controversial figures and has been the focus of several films and television series, having even lampooned in children's cartoons for almost a century. Ridley Scott puts a spotlight on the self-made Emperor with Joaquin Phoenix donning the bicorn hat this time around in his upcoming historical biopic.</p><p>Scott has taken liberties before with historical events, going back-to-back with Gladiator and Black Hawk Down, but that doesn't stop him from making his type of movies. The director became interested in Napoleon just over 15 years ago and after the first trailer dropped, was immediately bombarded with experts pointing out the inaccuracies.</p><p>TV historian Dan Snow posted a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@historyhit/video/7254913401468554523">TikTok breakdown</a> of the errors explaining how things happened but also praised Scott's filmmaking.
