Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 reviewed by Charlie Wacholz on PC. Also available on PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch.
Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 finally lives up to its name, standing as an all-star platform fighter. Not only is it a fantastic sequel that takes criticisms of the first game to heart and sends them to the blast zone, it expands way beyond those adjustments. Decent (if samey) single-player options with a good amount of challenge, a training mode clearly made by people who know exactly how to construct a platform-fighting laboratory on a level rarely seen, and stellar rollback netplay bolster a supremely fun fighting system. The excellent new Slime mechanic then elevates it to a new level by introducing a huge amount of creativity to every character in its impressive roster without making it unapproachable for the party game audience. Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 belongs among the greats of the platform fighting genre – and the moment I’m done writing this, I’m going back f

The future of the MCU may be facing some shake-ups.

According to a new report from Variety, there’s been plenty of behind-the-scenes turmoil for the once impervious franchise, ranging from talk of replacing Kang the Conqueror with Doctor Doom because of Jonathan Majors’ legal troubles, to the troubled Mahershala Ali Blade reboot going through yet another rework, to – most surprising of all – Marvel’s top brass floating the idea of bringing back the original Avengers to help right the ship.

The fact that reviving the OG team is even being considered so soon after the Infinity Saga wrapped up indicates just how much the MCU’s recent financial and critical disappointments have taken a toll. What was once Marvel’s winning strategy – taking lower-tier characters like the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy and turning them into A-listers – has now become a weakness as new players like Shang-Chi and the Eternals just haven’t caught on.

The projects that were supposed to kickstart the M

EA Sports WRC reviewed by Luke Reilly on Xbox Series X. Also available on PlayStation 5 and PC.

"EA Sports WRC takes the class-leading feel of 2019’s Dirt Rally 2.0 and stuffs it into an officially licensed World Rally Championship experience, like a steel rod in Timo Rautiainen’s backside. Loose surface handling remains supreme, stages have been pumped up to 30 kilometre marathons, the audio is excellent, and the selection of modern and historical rally cars is achingly close to spot-on. However, just like a steel rod into your co-driver’s buttocks, there have also been some unwelcome, performance-related side effects and some serious lost position in the graphics race with the competition. Stuttering and tearing are common while racing on Xbox Series X, and the fidelity here falls well short of being a generational leap from Dirt Rally 2.0. With these technical shortfalls, combined with a lukewarm career mode and underdone customisation, EA Sports WRC feels like a great racing gam

Homer apparently gives up strangling Bart on The Simpsons. It should come as no surprise that #TheSimpsons has decided to move away from such violence, as society has evolved in a way where such depictions are often looked at negatively in today’s current climate - that’s not all that’s changed: The Simpsons got its start as an edgy cartoon for adults on the newly formed Fox network, but now it’s under Disney’s considerably more family-friendly roof. Eric Bauza, the voice of numerous Merry Melody characters like Bugs Bunny, is lending his voice to Bob’s Burgers as the new voice of Jimmy Pesto. And finally in live action news, Marvel’s launching something new called Marvel Spotlight. This’ll be a new banner for projects Marvel fans can enjoy without extensive knowledge of the MCU’s back catalog, containing stories that exist outside of the MCU’s lengthy continuity.

Insomniac's Spider-Man 2 is out, and gamers are already speculating on a possible (let's face it, very likely) Spider-Man 3. But with two Spider-Men (Spider-Mans?) who will take the lead on the next game? The developer's give an official answer, which we won't spoil in this description. Either way, there's always the possibility of smaller spin-off titles like 2020's Miles Morales starring any number of Spider-People. In other news, a developer with Naughty Dog confirmed there's still work going on for that Last of Us multiplayer game that was supposedly put on indefinite hold earlier this year. Maybe we'll finally see some gameplay soon? And finally, The Finals saw a huge open beta weekend, with more than seven million playing the latest free-to-play multiplayer shooter. Did you enjoy it?
