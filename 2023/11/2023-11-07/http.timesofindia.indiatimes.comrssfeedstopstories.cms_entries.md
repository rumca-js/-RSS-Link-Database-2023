The Supreme Court has directed Delhi and its surrounding states to immediately stop stubble burning and called the odd-even plan to restrict vehicles on Delhi's roads as mere "optics". Instead, the court suggested using different colored tags for diesel, petrol, and CNG vehicles and banning only orange-coded vehicles. The court emphasized the need for all stakeholders to come together to find solutions to the perennial problem of pollution. The court also mentioned that stopping minimum support price for paddy could be considered as an option. The case will be monitored on a weekly basis.

Mumbai is experiencing high levels of air pollution, with the air quality index (AQI) rising above 300 in some areas, surpassing levels in Delhi. This has led to an increase in respiratory complaints, particularly among children. The causes of the pollution are not yet clear, but ongoing construction, metro construction, vehicular pollution, climate change, and photochemical reactions are all potential factors. Experts are also considering whether highrises may be blocking the sea breeze, preventing it from dispersing pollutants. Further studies are needed to determine the exact causes and the extent of the pollution problem in Mumbai.

On Tuesday, 20 assembly constituencies in LWE-hit areas of Chhattisgarh and all 40 seats in Mizoram that went to polls recorded a turnout of 71.1% and 77.8% respectively.

Scientists have made a groundbreaking discovery where one virus attached itself to another, as observed in bacteriophage viruses. This unique event involved a satellite virus attaching itself to a helper virus, a phenomenon that has never been seen before. The attachment occurred at the 'neck' of the virus, where the outer shell of the helper virus connects to its tail. This remarkable discovery was made possible through the use of an electron microscope. The findings were published in the Journal of the International Society for Microbial Ecology.
