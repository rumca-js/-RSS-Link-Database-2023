		Changing expectations for digital interactions are ratcheting up pressure on banks to upgrade the identity verification and authentication capabilities of their mobile apps, according to a new report from <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/mitek-systems-inc">Mitek</a>.

At the same time as mobile banking has been transforming the retail financial industry, mobile-first interactions have been overhauling user expectations. Banks have been dutifully adopting technologies like multi-factor authentication and biometrics to secure their mobile apps, but Mitek’s report shows that their efforts are having mixed impacts on customer experience.

		A New York State Bar working group has weighed in on the side of restraint in a pair of issues involving facial recognition. Its report is expected to help craft association policy.

The committee last week issued a report on the use of biometric systems and access to legal representation.

Committee members say that consumers <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/property-access-fight-in-nyc-draws-a-biometric-privacy-lawsuit">should have certain rights</a> to privacy when it comes to facial recognition and, separately, that lawyers should not be discriminated against just because of whom they represent – in this case, through facial recognition.

First, the report recommends (with one abstention) that members officially stand behind State Senate Bill

		There are qualms in Israel about emergency policy changes being sought for biometric identification.

According to one local report, it appears that the government might be using its war with Hamas to hold on to citizens' face- and fingerprint records longer and for purposes beyond identifying those killed, missing and abducted.

An <a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/article/rytjtivq6">article</a> in Calcalist, a business and technology publication, says officials enacted emergency rules that allow government workers – including, for the first time, police and security agencies -- to use the national biometric database to search for the identities of <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202310/israel-is-using-amazon-rekognition-to-locate-missing-and-dead"

		In its latest Public Trust Forum Report, the Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada (<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/diacc">DIACC</a>) says hesitations about digital trust capabilities are partly the result of a gap in education around biometrics and digital identity, and partly due to missing or incomplete <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202310/oix-paper-identifies-the-dna-of-digital-id-trust-frameworks">trust frameworks</a>.

In a release, DIACC President Joni Brennan says concerns about data privacy, biometric security and potential misuse of personal information are understandable. “People should rightly be concerned because there are often no easily understood rules around where their personal data lives, who owns it, or how ot

The system would make obtaining a legal ID document easier for homeless people, immigrants, those recently released from incarcerati

		Indian police are nearly ready to expand their biometrics collection at more than a thousand build Measurement Collection Units (MCU) across the country. MCUs are offices that will be used to collect and store face and DNA biometrics such as blood, semen and hair samples for the identification of persons involved in criminal matters.

The MCU, provided for in the Criminal Procedure (Identification) Act of 2022 <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202208/expanded-scope-of-biometrics-collection-storage-for-indian-police-enters-into-force">which was okayed in Parliament last year</a>, will be available at police stations and offices and will collect extra biometric data to be added to the country’s existing criminal identification database which includes footprints, finge

The fraud problem that has accompanied public services and benefits is well known. The next step in clamping down on this fraud is also well understood in some places, but efforts and understanding are being held back in the U.S. by a difference in the country’s identity infrastructure, and arguably culture, from countries in the Europe Union.

The EU has national ID cards that support the convergence between biometrics and digital identity, giving relying parties a way to be sure that the people they interact with o
