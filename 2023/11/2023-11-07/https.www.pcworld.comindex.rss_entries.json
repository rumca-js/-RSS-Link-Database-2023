After just one more breathless episode, Yahtzee was hired to make his <em>Zero Punctuation</em> videos for gaming site The Escapist. And he&rsquo;s been making a new review <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq795_XSJfw&amp;xcust=2-2-2129244-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">almost every single week</a> for the last sixteen years.
