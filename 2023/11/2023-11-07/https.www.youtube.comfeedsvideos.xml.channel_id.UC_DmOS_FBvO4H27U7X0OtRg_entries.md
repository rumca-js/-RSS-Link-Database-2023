Welcome to Angola. We've arrived at Kalandula (Calandula) waterfall. The second biggest in Africa after Victoria Falls. In the last video of our Angola series, we're trying to see if we we can sleep at it's base.

The Camera used in the Waterfall was the Insta360 X3 with the "No Drone No Problem Pole"
