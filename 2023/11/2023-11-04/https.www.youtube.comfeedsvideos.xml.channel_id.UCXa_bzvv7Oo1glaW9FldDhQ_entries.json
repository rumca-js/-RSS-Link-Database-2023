This includes but is not limited to weather effects like snow. \n\nCreating realistic snow is a tricky job, but there are quite a few games that do a great job of creating frigid environments with highly detailed snow particles and terrain deformation when you walk or run over such surfaces. Some games go the extra mile to nail the functionality of snow by altering the gameplay in a meaningful way. \n\nWith this feature, we take a look at 10 such games and detail what makes their implementations so amazing.\n\nThumbnail credit: MP1ST", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wS8aHD6ufs", "date_published": "2023-11-04T21:00:02+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/3wS8aHD6ufs/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "10 Things WE WANT TO SEE In Starfield\u2019s Story Expansions - DLC", "description": "While it may have gotten a bit lost with all the big releases lately, Starfield's journey is only just beginning.

New story missions and quests are a given, but it would be nice to have features like land vehicles and mounts, activities like underwater exploration and more impactful choices.\n\nCheck out ten things we'd like to see in the space-faring RPG's upcoming DLC and expansions.
