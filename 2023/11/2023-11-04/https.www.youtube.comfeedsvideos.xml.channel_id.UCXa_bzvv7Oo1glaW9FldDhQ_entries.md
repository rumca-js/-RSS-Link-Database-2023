There’s just something deeply immersive about beautifully realized video game worlds that do a good job of mimicking how things function in real life. This includes but is not limited to weather effects like snow. 

Creating realistic snow is a tricky job, but there are quite a few games that do a great job of creating frigid environments with highly detailed snow particles and terrain deformation when you walk or run over such surfaces. Some games go the extra mile to nail the functionality of snow by altering the gameplay in a meaningful way.

While it may have gotten a bit lost with all the big releases lately, Starfield's journey is only just beginning. Bethesda Game Studios has already committed to DLC of varying sizes, with one story expansion, Shattered Space, already confirmed.

New story missions and quests are a given, but it would be nice to have features like land vehicles and mounts, activities like underwater exploration and more impactful choices.

Check out ten things we'd like to see in the space-faring RPG's upcoming DLC and expansions. With luck, some of these will arrive sooner rather than later.
