This was an incredibly insightful pair programming session and I feel much more confident moving forward.\n\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0f Dev Notes Newsletter: https://www.devnotesdaily.com/\n\ud83c\udfa5 Dev Notes on YouTube: @devnotesdaily  \n\ud83d\udcd3  Studious, Notion Template for Students: https://notionstudent.com\n\nI'm building a platform for programmers and folks interested in computer science to discuss current tech & programming news, how we can utilize it as programmers, and what it means for us and the software development industry. It's under the same umbrella as the Dev Notes newsletter, which is a newsletter for programmers and folks interested in computer science - but the platform is to foster community and encourage discussion about these topics.\n\n\ud83d\udc31\u200d\ud83d\ude80 GitHub: https://github.com/forrestknight\n\ud83d\udc26 Twitter: https://www.twitte", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIsSsAqBus4", "date_published": "2023-11-04T12:00:11+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "ForrestKnight", "album": "ForrestKnight", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/FIsSsAqBus4/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}]
