Even though my initial intention is to use it for printing PLA, my preferences might change after I complete my initial prints. Since I reside in an apartment and my 3D printer will be located in my office (~20m¬≤), where I spend a significant amount of time working at my computer per day, safety is a top priority for me.</p> <p>I have reviewed several studies, and while PLA appears to be relatively safe, I am not willing to take any risks when it comes to long-term exposure to its fumes. Additionally, there might be a cat living with me at some point, so I want to ensure the environment is as safe as possible. Furthermore, since the apartment is not mine, I am keen on avoiding any potential damage over time.</p> <p>The room has a window that could potentially be used for ventilation, but I have read that this might negatively impact the pr

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was browsing AliExpress today and came across this auto bed leveling sensor that seems like it works like the Beacon except this is around $30 and the Beacon is $80.</p> <p>I've decided to give my printer a bit of maintenance lately and am now looking to add ABL, I was considering the Beacon but the price its a bit prohibitive. I might just give this thing a try, but I only just installed Klipper, since I only recently understood what the goal of that project was, and am still figuring things out.</p> <p>There appears to be 74 sold right now and I was wondering if anyone has given it a try and can give some feedback on it. </p> <p>AliExpress Page:</p> <p><a href="https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805982707485.html?spm=a2g0o.cart.0.0.500838daHY5THX&amp;gps-id=shoppingCartRecommend&amp;scm=1007.13440.311564.0&amp;scm_id=1007.13440.311564.0&amp;scm-url=1007.13440.311564.0&amp;pvid=8e83ecfd-39bd-4b60-b173-45701297c0d5&amp;_t=gps-id:shoppingCartRecomme
