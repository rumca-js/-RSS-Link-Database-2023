Thanks to a meeting with Alaister from @Supabase, we got confirmation on what I did right, what I did wrong, and made some progress in what I hadn't done yet in the build of the Dev Notes platform! This was an incredibly insightful pair programming session and I feel much more confident moving forward.

I'm building a platform for programmers and folks interested in computer science to discuss current tech & programming news, how we can utilize it as programmers, and what it means for us and the software development industry. It's under the same umbrella as the Dev Notes newsletter, which is a newsletter for programmers and folks interested in computer science - but the platform is to foster community and encourage discussion about these topics.
