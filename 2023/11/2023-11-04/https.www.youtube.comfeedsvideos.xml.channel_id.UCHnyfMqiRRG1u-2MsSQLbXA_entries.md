We visited the US Navy to test the best night vision goggles in the world. Head to https://brilliant.org/veritasium to start your free 30-day trial, and the first 200 people get 20% off an annual premium subscription.

If you’re looking for a molecular modeling kit, head to https://ve42.co/SnatomsV to try Snatoms – a kit I invented where the atoms snap together magnetically.

Huge thanks to Dr. Ben Conley and the entire team at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division.
