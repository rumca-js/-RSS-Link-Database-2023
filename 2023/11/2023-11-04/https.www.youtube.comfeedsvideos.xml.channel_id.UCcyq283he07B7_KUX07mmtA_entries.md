Martin acoustic guitars are some of the most popular and well-known high-end acoustic guitars in the world. They're owned and played by pop stars like Ed Sheeran and Shawn Mendes. In the past, Elvis Presley, John Lennon, Kurt Cobain, and Bob Dylan all have used Martin guitars.

Today, the company is based in Nazareth, Pennsylvania, and is still owned by the descendants of its founder, Christian Frederick Martin.
