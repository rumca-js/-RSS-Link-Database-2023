In order to reduce crowding on escalators and at ticket barriers, says the consortium that wants to develop it, its cathedral-scaled concourse has to be demolished and replaced with a two-level arrangement, to pay for which a 16-storey office block will have to be perched over the station and the neighbouring Great Eastern hotel (now called the Andaz), both of which are listed buildings.</p><p>In which case, you would think that the developers would shout their evidence from the rooftops.

<p>The author’s latest novel dives into the hidden backwaters of queer history. He talks about losing inhibitions and finding his voice</p><p>It is morning in Manhattan, and the 43-year-old novelist Justin Torres is lying in bed, head propped up on one hand. He uprooted to the west coast of America a decade ago to teach English at UCLA, but was out late last night partying with friends from his old New York days. “I’m not even dressed yet,” he says in a sleepy croak.</p><p>The sight of Torres video-calling amid rumpled pillows feels apt given that his new book, Blackouts, is narrated from a clammy bed. The novel leads the reader through the hidden backwaters of queer history: in its hunt for buried cultural treasure, sex marks the spot. Torres has been surprised on his book tour to see it stocked in airport shops (“There are so many penises in it!”) and was not anticipating its release into today’s book-banning world. “That wasn’t on my radar at all,” he says. “I was thinking more ab

<p>As a young Black woman, racism made me fearful and angry. Then I met my white boyfriend and things got … complicated</p><p>I grew up a dark-skinned child in New Orleans in the 1980s when both racism and colourism were rampant. My mother was a light-skinned Black woman, and older girls at my all-Black Catholic school would ask me if I was adopted. When I said no, they would ask how then my mother could be so pretty and I could be so ugly. I was called ugly so often I settled into it; it became not so much a belief as an identity.</p><p>When I was 12, my mom and I moved to Connecticut, to a little town called Bethel where we were one of a handful of Black families.

<p>A man’s past comes back to haunt him when he returns home to rural Ireland, in this noirish metaphysical novel from the author of Solar Bones</p><p>Towards the end of This Plague of Souls, a familiar sound calls out to its protagonist, Nealon. The world is changing: some great alteration seems about to unfold. Nealon gazes at a television, waiting for information. “The signature tune for the news bulletin calls out. A brass fanfare over an electronic jitter snags beneath the peal of the angelus bell.” So the close of this haunting tale calls back to the opening of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/04/solar-bones-by-mike-mccormack-review" title="">Solar Bones</a>, McCormack’s previous book, in which the Angelus is ringing out on All Souls’ Day: “the bell / the bell as / hearing the bell as / hearing the bell as standing here / the bell being heard standing here / hearing it ring out through the grey light of this / morning, noon or night”.

<p>We’re on tour again, standing on stage and attempting to entertain the podcast ultras and the odd grumpy parent </p><p>I recently found myself sending a polite email to two of the UK’s most prominent outdoor explorer types about drinking their own urine. Or at least pretending to drink it. It’s not something I have experience of, but I guess you never know what the future holds. It is for a thing. No, it really is. Perhaps unsurprisingly I haven’t heard back. I am too embarrassed to follow up.</p><p>It’s not the first time I’ve caught myself wondering exactly how the course of life’s events have resulted in something ridiculous in the name of work: sharing a sofa with Mr T, being whipped by Anne Diamond, sword fighting with Frank Leboeuf, watching a knight of the realm deface pictures of footballers in newspapers with phallic images. What have you just done to Jan Vertonghen? What odd situations to end up in if we don’t truly have free will. And if we do, then what meaningful cont

<p>Max Verstappen and the purists despise them but Formula One is flexible enough to know the format needs a revamp for next season</p><p>Loathed and loved, Formula One’s sprint race format remains a distinctive, divisive subject for the sport. However, while its detractors might wrinkle their noses at the short-form weekend they must accept it is here to stay. Yet there is some solace, too, in the knowledge that F1 is flexible enough to consider changing the structure again in an attempt to successfully fine tune it.</p><p>The sprint was introduced in 2020, with the intent of livening up a race weekend, offering more competitive sessions. It has split opinion since and with the sixth and final sprint of the season at the Brazilian Grand Prix this weekend it is once again under scrutiny.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/nov/04/f1-sprint-races-need-a-reboot-reverse-grids-or-1m-prize-could-be-the-spark">Continue reading...</a>

He’s had it since January, and worries about it a lot, initially because it made his beard grow into a tiny and slightly lopsided Hitler moustache. Seriously though – you can hardly see it). “I would never ask that,” I say. “Why?” “Because it’s rude.

Much the same goes for parsley stalks, which can usually be eaten alongside the leaves, so long as they’re finely chopped
