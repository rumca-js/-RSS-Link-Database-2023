Noel Frame isn&#8217;t disappointed in Jeff Bezos&#8217; decision to move to Miami, despite the potential loss of revenue from a wealth tax she&#8217;s been pushing for in her home state. Frame spoke to GeekWire on Friday following news that the Amazon founder is moving away from his longtime home in the Seattle area to be closer to family in Miami and operations for his Blue Origin space venture. Bezos, who stepped down as Amazon CEO in 2021, didn&#8217;t cite taxes in his Instagram post announcing the move to Miami, but the decision sparked questions about whether tax policy&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2023/washington-state-senator-behind-wealth-tax-proposal-responds-to-bezos-departure/\">Read More</a>", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2023/washington-state-senator-behind-wealth-tax-proposal-responds-to-bezos-departure", "date_published": "2023-11-04T17:26:31+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GeekWire", "album": "GeekWire", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://www.geekwire.com/wp-content/themes/geekwire/dist/images/geekwire-logo-rss.png", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "title": "GeekWire Podcast: Bezos\u2019 big move, Convoy\u2019s last stop, AI meets VC, and more news of the week", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"945\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/jeffsgarage-1260x945.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />What should we make of Jeff Bezos&#8217; decision to move from Seattle to Miami?
