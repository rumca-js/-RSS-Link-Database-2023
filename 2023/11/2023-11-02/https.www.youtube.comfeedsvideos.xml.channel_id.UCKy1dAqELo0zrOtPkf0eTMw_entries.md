Quantum Error reviewed on PlayStation 5 by Jarrett Green.
If your goal this Halloween season is to scare up some heart pounding, palm-sweating first person horror action, Quantum Error should be low on your list of priorities. Its stylish and unsettling camera work suggests a depth and mystery that just is not here. Instead, you’ll be terrorized by some extremely stupid and repetitive monsters and tortured by a painfully austere checkpoint system that comes with sometimes-gamebreaking respawns. Weapons are competent but rather mundane for the rich and moody sci-fi setting, and the ghost of missed opportunity haunts the firefighting system, which appears robust mechanically but is given almost no opportunity to justify its inclusion at all.

What could possibly go right?

From real life stunt man and director David Leitch, the director of Bullet Train, Deadpool 2, Atomic Blonde and Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw and the producer of John Wick, Nobody and Violent Night, comes his most personal film yet. A new hilarious, hard-driving, all-star apex-action thriller and love letter to action movies and the hard-working and under-appreciated crew of people who make them: The Fall Guy.

The Talos Principle 2 reviewed by Will Borger on PC, also available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.

"Puzzles are meant to be solved, while philosophy deals with something that, inherently, can’t be. That this sequel manages to explore both simultaneously is incredibly impressive. There are issues with the difficulty curve in spots, but those complaints pale in comparison to everything The Talos Principle 2 does right."

The Invincible reviewed by Andrew McMahon on PC. Also available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.

The Invincible is a prime example of trying to fit a square peg of a story into the round hole that is the medium of video games. While the premise and story both contain worthwhile parts, the light, pointless gameplay built around it could be much better, as it lacks any depth to its puzzles and is weighed down by too much tedious walking around empty and lifeless locations that, when you get anywhere near them, don’t look very good. There’s only so much even a likable protagonist like Yasna can do with a story, environment, and mechanics that don’t give you much to do until you’re seven hours in. If you are looking for an enjoyable sci-fi story about space exploration and mystery, your time would likely be better spent simply reading Stanislaw Lem's 1964 novel, The Invincible; at least your imagination won’t be as limited as this game seems to be.
