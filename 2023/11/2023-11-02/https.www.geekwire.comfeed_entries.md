Less than two years after opening its first tech-infused physical clothing store, Amazon is closing its only two Style stores, the company confirmed Thursday. “After careful consideration, we’ve decided to close our two Amazon Style physical retail stores and focus on our online fashion shopping experience,&#8221; Kristen Kish, an Amazon spokesperson, said in an emailed statement to GeekWire. &#8220;Physical retail remains an important part of our business, and we’re continuing to invest in growing our grocery stores business.&#8221; Bloomberg first reported the news.

The newly unredacted allegations include claims about Jeff Bezos&#8217; behind-the-scenes role in some of the tactics that form the basis for the FTC complaint, dating back to when he was CEO. They also confirm the government&#8217;s portrayal of Amazon&#8217;s &#8220;Project Nessie&#8221; as a scheme to raise prices — an interpretation that Amazon vehemently disputes.

The VTS Office Demand Index (VODI) report released this week shows Seattle experienced the greatest quarterly decline in demand for office space, with a 43% drop quarter-over-quarter and 52% drop year-over-year. According to VTS, VODI tracks unique new tenant tour requirements of office properties in core U.S. markets. It&#8217;s intended to serve as an early indicator of upcoming office leasing activity and track new tenant demand.

That&#8217;s one potential takeaway from the surprise closure of PCC Community Markets&#8217; downtown grocery store and reports of a stalling return-to-office trend. The store, in the heart of downtown Seattle at 1320 4th Ave., opened just last year following pandemic-related delays. It will close Jan. 31. PCC CEO Krish Srinivasan, a former Remitly and Amazon exec, said in a statement Wednesday that the flagship store is unprofitable and &#8220;we do not see that changing for the foreseeable future.&#8221; In a press release, PCC said the store has &#8220;significantly underperformed&#8221; relative to original forecasts &#8220;in&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/seattle-grocery-store-pcc-blames-lower-number-of-office-workers-as-it-clo
