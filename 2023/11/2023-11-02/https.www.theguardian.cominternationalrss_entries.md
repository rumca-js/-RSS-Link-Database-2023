<p>Move against Santos failed after lawmakers argued it would set bad precedent</p><p>Good morning, US politics blog readers. As evening arrived yesterday, lawmakers in the House of Representatives were presented with the opportunity to expel admitted fabulist <strong>George Santos</strong>, and censure both progressive Democrat <strong>Rashida Tlaib</strong> and rightwing Republican <strong>Marjorie Taylore Greene</strong>. But none of those things ended up happening. Despite the fact that Santos is facing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/oct/27/george-santos-pleads-not-guilty-fraud-charges-new-york">23 federal fraud charges</a>, and lied about most his qualifications for the job, an ideologically mixed group of Democrats and Republicans voted against removing him from his seat. Many argued doing so would set a bad precedent since he has not been convicted of a crime – the usual bar for booting a lawmaker.</p><p>Meanwhile, several of Greene’s fellow Republicans join

<p>Guns are used so often in suicide that if the left were associated with lax gun laws, the right might accuse liberals of conspiring to kill white men</p><p>The gunman who a week ago killed 18 people in Lewiston, Maine, finished his bloodbath by shooting himself. Like many mass shootings, his rampage appears to have been a suicide that took others with him. Mass shootings draw deserved media attention, but they are a small percent of all gun deaths in the US; suicide is the most common way people die by gun. That is, if you own or have access to a gun, the person you’re most likely to kill is yourself. Fifty-four percent of US gun deaths are suicides, which means access to a gun is a major risk factor for dying this way.</p><p>This fact, often cited but rarely examined, means the gun industry is pushing guns the same way the tobacco industry pushed cigarettes: their intentions toward their customers are blithely murderous. It also undermines the advertisements and arguments claimin

The programmeshow sees posh Londonites called names like “Binky” and “Boulle” cheat on each other, and then deny it in nice cafes. Of course, there’s an element of human drama: romance (well, people cheating on each other), intrigue (which nice cafe will it be this time?), and mistaken identity (I genuinely still can’t tell most of them apart), but this is hardly high-class stuff, despite being literally high-class stuff. So why do I love it so much that I’ve written a play about it? Well, theatre is the perfect medium for expressing tension and contradiction, and there’s nothing more tense and contradictory in me than my love/hate relationship with these wel
