Scientists have proposed that the large low-shear-velocity provinces (LLVPs), or "blobs," deep within Earth's mantle are remnants of a protoplanet called Theia. The collision between Theia and Earth 4.5 billion years ago led to the formation of the Moon and left behind parts of Theia near Earth's core. The research, published in Nature, suggests that these LLVPs are "buried relics" of the collision. The study provides a comprehensive case for this hypothesis.

North Korea is reportedly closing its overseas embassies as its economy struggles and it embraces a "new Cold War" diplomacy with Russia. The country has recently closed embassies in Hong Kong and Spain and announced "farewell visits" by its ambassadors to African allies. Experts suggest that the closures indicate the effectiveness of UN sanctions against North Korea and the country's dire economic situation. The closures also highlight a shift in Pyongyang's diplomatic strategy, as it aligns more closely with China and Russia.
