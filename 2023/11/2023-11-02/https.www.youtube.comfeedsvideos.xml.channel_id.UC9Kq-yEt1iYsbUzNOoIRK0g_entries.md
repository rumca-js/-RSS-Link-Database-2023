Five Nights At Freddy’s is an incredibly popular video game with a deep lore that people seem to be obsessed with. But does a jump-scary video game translate well to a two-hour-long feature film with minimal jumpscares and a whole lot of sleeping?

Five Nights At Freddy’s definitely raises some questions. Like why are we spending so much time in a field of dreams? How is there only like one jumpscare in this thing? How does William Afton actually control these things, and how does knowing he’s evil change that for them? Does that cop not have any cop stuff to do?

To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to Five Nights At Freddy’s!
