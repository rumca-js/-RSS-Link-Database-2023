<p>People pleasing won’t guarantee others’ wellbeing, writes advice columnist <strong>Eleanor Gordon-Smith</strong>, but it will ensure you feel resentful</p><p><strong>I feel like I put other people’s needs before my own. The other day I went to see a film that I didn’t want to see because my friend desperately wanted to, </strong><strong> and she’s a good and kind friend. Afterwards we went for a drink, even though I don’t really drink any more. I didn’t tell her I didn’t want to drink. I know she would have supported my decision but would also have been disappointed. I was cross with myself for drinking because I didn’t enjoy it and felt rubbish afterwards.</strong></p><p><strong>I give my teenage daughters lifts places, despite there being a good bus service</strong><strong>. I go on long walks with my husband at the weekend when I’m tired </strong><strong> and all I want to do is sit all day and read a book.

<p>American Ornithological Society to change names referencing people or deemed offensive for ones that better describe species</p><p>A new rule from the American Ornithological Society (AOS) will cause reverberations around the birding world, and create new names for hundreds of species. The society says it has engaged in conversations with the community of birders, and will focus on first renaming the 70 to 80 species in the US and Canada that are named after people – or have names deemed offensive or exclusionary. Their efforts will start in 2024.</p><p>This means Anna’s hummingbird, named after an Italian duchess, and Lewis’s woodpecker, named after explorer Meriwether Lewis, will change. The society drew particular attention to undoing birds whose names are tied to historical wrongs – as in the case of Townsend’s warbler, named after John Kirk Townsend, who <a href="https://www.oregonhistoryproject.org/articles/historical-records/john-kirk-townsend-1809-1851/#:~:text=He%20depend

<p>Company posts fourth consecutive revenue loss but its shares have been up about 32.5% so far this year</p><p>Apple posted its fourth consecutive revenue loss for the quarter ending in September, with $89.5bn in revenue – a 1% decrease from the previous quarter. The decline was not unexpected, though the total quarterly revenue beat Wall Street predictions of $89.28bn. Apple did enjoy $43.81bn in iPhone revenue for the quarter ending in September – a quarterly revenue record, according to Apple CEO Tim Cook.</p><p>Despite the expected drop in sales, Apple’s stock rose more than 2% ahead of the scheduled earnings call and shares have been up about 32.5% so far this year. The earnings report comes as the company is in the middle of what is typically the busiest quarter, with the holiday season coming up. Investors will likely be looking for details on how the current quarter is faring and the status of demand for the iPhone 15 – released just days before the end of the quarter.</p> <

This crisp, questioning and perhaps too light drama argues that it was much more than that by interrogating journalistic practice and drawing (not entirely convincing) associations with today’s fake news.</p><p>We follow the making of the documentary through to Bashir’s fall 25 years later when his deceit was exposed in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/may/20/a-cover-up-what-the-dyson-report-said-about-the-bbc-and-martin-bashir">Lord Dyson’s report</a>, as well as the BBC’s defence of his methods in the interim.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/nov/02/the-interview-review-martin-bashir-princess-diana-park-theatre-londo

It was brief and rather moving, but it offered a tactfully bowdlerised version of events, understandably stepping around the parts of the story that might cause anyone to regard Now and Then with a wary eye. It talked about the surviving Beatles’ initial attempts to work up John Lennon’s late 70s demos in the mid-90s, but didn’t mention the slightly muted response the completed versions of Free as a Bird and Real Love received. It was the height of Britpop, the Beatles’ stock higher – and their influence on current music more obvious – than at any point since their split. And

Or, at the very least, a debased and dysfunctional version of themselves (Amy Schumer’s Trainwreck, all of Pete Davidson’s semi-autobiographical comedy). The new Hulu comedy Quiz Lady stars the comedian Awkwafina – AKA the dramatic actor Nora Lum, who stole scenes in Crazy Rich Asians and won accolades for her work as a grieving granddaughter in The Farewell – in loser drag as Annie Yum, a slouchy thirtysomething recluse long obsessed with a daily televised quiz show. The film’s hook is her pairing with Sandra Oh, playing against type as Annie’s brash Peter Pan of an older sister, Jenny.</p><p>Good premise, bumpy ride.

The first full-length black British film, Pressure is vigorous and rough-hewn and Ové lays down the broad brushstrokes with compulsive energy. It has the punchy quality of a 21st-century graphic novel, eagerly tackling Black Power and social realism, mixing comedy, tragedy and irony. There’s a surreal fantasy sequence, a moment of real horror in a hospital and a full-on Sweeney-style police foot-chase through the streets.</p><p>The film’s reappearance may be a madeleine for the 70s, but it’s also a reminder that the pressure Britain’s black communities have withstood hasn’t subsided.

<p>The Middle East is the greatest area of vulnerability for the United States, and many countries want to cause trouble</p><p>At first sight, it looks almost inevitable that the war in Gaza will spread. Quite apart from the anger it has caused in the Muslim world, China and still more Russia would seem to have every incentive to cause trouble for the United States – and, as has been demonstrated again and again over the years, the Middle East is the greatest area of US vulnerability.</p><p>On closer examination, things do not look so simple. In the first place, if Moscow and Beijing are content with a purely diplomatic and public relations victory, they do not need to do anything at all.

<p>After writing for the likes of Taylor Swift and Adele, Wilson is back with the US rock band for their first album in 22 years</p><p>In 1998, the US rock band Semisonic released a song, Closing Time, that has barely left the airwaves since. A smash hit on both sides of the Atlantic, the song matched a peerless melody to a strikingly positive sentiment – one that posited the “last call” at a bar not as the end of something but as the start of a whole new life. After the song hit, a trio of other smart Semisonic singles cracked the British top 40. But less than three years after their initial success, the band decided to break up. “We always knew that the time would be right at one point for us to get back together,” said the band’s leader Dan Wilson. “But I can’t account for the fact that the right time turned out to be <em>so </em>much later than we thought.”</p><p>In fact, 22 years have elapsed between the last Semisonic album, All About Chemistry, and the new one, Little Bit of S

<p>Inspired by Michael Jordan, the American created an entire training method and is dreaming of an ‘armless 1-2-3’ in Paris </p><p>Matt Stutzman believes that controlling adrenaline is crucial if you want to be a successful archer. So he used to have a quick parachute jump before training. “I literally would shoot my bow, get on a plane and jump out,” he says. “Then I would land close by, shoot my bow until the adrenaline wore off and then go back up and jump out again.”</p><p>This may not be the kind of training approach that works for every athlete, but Stutzman is a bit different from the norm. For a start the American from Iowa is a world champion archer, and recreational parachutist, who was born with no arms. He is also someone who, since childhood, has been in determined pursuit of what he calls a “Michael Jordan moment”, the point where one person not only changes their sport but the perception of it. And come the Paralympics in Paris in a year’s time, it seems likely he wil

<p>A cleverly fragmentary tale of love, memory and time from the author of Fugitive Pieces shuffles the hopes and dreams of four generations</p><p>The Canadian novelist and poet Anne Michaels is still best known for her 1996 first novel, the multi-award-winning <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/fugitive-pieces" title="">Fugitive Pieces</a>. That title could serve as a description of this new book, a novel made up of scraps of storytelling and essayistic fragments.</p><p>Towards the end of Held in terms of pages, but near the beginning in terms of chronology, we find ourselves in Paris in 1908, in very distinguished company. Ernest Rutherford, pioneer of nuclear physics, is dining with Marie and Pierre Curie. It is a hot summer night. The party moves out into the garden to take coffee by the light of a new-fangled lantern – an irradiated copper tube. Talk turns to Madame Palladino, the celebrated medium. Pierre Curie, who has been unable to prove Palladino is a fraud, says: “

<p>AI-enhanced song released at 2pm GMT today, but Beatles experts are divided over how effectively it could capture the band’s spirit</p><p>George Harrison originally disliked it; fans had long assumed it would never be released. But the “final” song by the Beatles, Now and Then, is being released at 2pm GMT, an unexpected last flourish for arguably the UK’s greatest band.</p><p>“It’s a big moment,” says Dr <a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/music/staff/holly-s-tessler/">Holly Tessler</a> of the University of Liverpool, who specialises in the Beatles’ history and legacy. “It’s strange to think that a band that broke up more than 50 years ago is telling you that this is our last song … in a way, Paul and Ringo, who are both in their 80s, are drawing a line. It’s a very sweet moment I suspect for almost all Beatles fans; it feels like an ending. So I do think it’s significant.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/nov/02/excitement-beatles-final-song-now-and-then-rele

There is a lot of Clair de Lune: these are busy times. On the van’s exterior, surrounding big, smiley King, are grey silhouettes of some of his victims, including a wasp, a rodent and a cockroach. There is also a wide-bodied insect that looks as if it could be from millions of years ago, but is very much current: a bedbug.

<p>Since a show of unity at Labour conference, anger and upset have been growing over the leader’s stance. Can Keir Starmer heal the rift? Aletha Adu reports</p><p>Just a few weeks ago Keir Starmer’s party was projecting an image of unity. Labour was 20 points ahead in the polls, and Starmer had led a successful and smooth party conference. But since the conflict in the Middle East has worsened, and the death toll has risen, that unity has cracked.</p><p><strong>Shaista Aziz</strong> is a Labour councillor in Oxford – one of eight who have resigned from the party after an interview Starmer gave in which he said that Israel had the right to withhold water and power from Palestinians. Ten days later he clarified his words, saying he had only meant Israel had a right to defend itself. But, Shaista says, the damage was done – and many Labour voters felt betrayed that the leader could be so careless with his words.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/nov/02/how-the-is
