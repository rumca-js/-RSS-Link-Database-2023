Over the past few weeks of our Error 402 series on the history of web monetization, we talked about the rise of the commercialized internet, and how it enabled transactions online, leading to the original dot com bubble around e-commerce. But, as we noted, nearly all of that was based on using the internet as [&#8230;]

As far back as I can remember, cell site location info (CSLI) was always covered by the Third Party Doctrine. That court-created doctrine said anything &#8220;voluntarily&#8221; handed over to third parties can be obtained by the government. Without a warrant. That not only includes bank records, phone records, and other transactional records we possibly haven&#8217;t [&#8230;]

A few weeks ago, I highlighted how EU chief Digital Services Act enforcer, Thierry Breton, was making a mess of things sending broadly threatening letters (which have since been followed up with opening official investigations) to all the big social media platforms. His initial letter highlighted the DSA’s requirements regarding takedowns of illegal content, but [&#8230;]

A burglary case that included evidence found at the scene (broken glass, a canister of pepper spray) and an apparent eyewitness has fallen apart because the government decided going right to Google meant it could ignore Supreme Court precedent and the Constitution. That&#8217;s the story here. Angelique Grace was indicted on burglary charges. Ultimately, a [&#8230;]

Back in March of this year, Elon Musk effectively admitted that he had set fire to more than half of Twitter’s value in telling employees that they’d be getting stock grants with the company valued around $20 billion. That’s a pretty steep discount from the $44 billion he paid for the company. Now, some would [&#8230;]

When Google Fiber launched back in 2010, it was heralded as a game changer for the broadband industry. Google Fiber, we were told, would revolutionize the industry by taking Silicon Valley money and disrupting the viciously uncompetitive and anti-competitive U.S. telecom sector. Initially, things worked out well; cities&#160;tripped over themselves&#160;offering all manner of perks to [&#8230;]

The LAPD&#8217;s handling of gang violence hasn&#8217;t gone well. For years, gang task forces roamed the city, violating rights repeatedly. Adding insult to these injuries, the city spent millions funding a predictive policing program that did little more than encourage biased policing. Then there&#8217;s the LAPD&#8217;s gang database, a horrendous mess filled with people designated [&#8230;]
