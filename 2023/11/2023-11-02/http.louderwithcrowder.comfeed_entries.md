At least that is what I had to do in college. Although I hated debating in favor of a leftist cause that I loathe, I still did it with the intent of winning the debate, which I did. Now, you would think that high school students participating in one of the most prestigious national high school debate tournaments would do the same. But nope, not if it means denying the existence of “trans genocide.” </p><p>For the record, there is no trans <a href="https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/explorer/crime/hate-crime" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">genocide</a>. </p><p>James Fishback <a href="https://twitter.com/j_fishback/status/1719060564633169921" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted </a>on X the final round of stud

My boy Brandon Morse <a href="https://redstate.com/author/brandon_morse" target="_blank">has the genre on lock</a>. I'm okay with simply not watching for the most part. However, I read something about how Marvel was set to ruin the <em>Blade</em> reboot that was a mindnumbing ridiculous parody of how people accuse Disney of ruining movies. You would think it was <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/gina-carano-south-park-panderverse-kathleen-kennedy" target="_blank">an episode of South Park</a>.</p><p>Blade is a vampire hunter.

The album the song is on, <em>Highway Desperado</em>, comes out Friday, so Aldean is being given a fresh round of media interviews to apologize. SPOILER: he does not. However, there is one thing he "might" change. Emphasis on "might."</p><p>To recap, in July, Aldean released a song about the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jason-aldean-small-town-acoustic" target="_blank">crime and violence that has grown common in progressive cities</a>. It's what happens when progressive voters elect progressive politicians to enact progressive policies that lead to the crime and violence.

And that Tucker now in his "Podcast Era" is something to mock. There are two things wrong there. The first is that cable news is a dying medium with a dwindling audience. The other is that Tucker is having way too much fun to give a f*ck.</p><p>Carlson is having a <em>Bullowrth</em> moment. Only where Warren Beaty's character in the movie appropriated urban culture, Tucker is all in <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/trump-indictment-37-charges" target="_blank">on bro culture</a>.
