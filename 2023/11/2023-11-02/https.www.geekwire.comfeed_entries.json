The newly unredacted allegations include claims about Jeff Bezos&#8217; behind-the-scenes role in some of the tactics that form the basis for the FTC complaint, dating back to when he was CEO. They also confirm the government&#8217;s portrayal of Amazon&#8217;s &#8220;Project Nessie&#8221; as a scheme to raise prices \u2014 an interpretation that Amazon vehemently disputes.

The VTS Office Demand Index (VODI) report released this week shows Seattle experienced the greatest quarterly decline in demand for office space, with a 43% drop quarter-over-quarter and 52% drop year-over-year. According to VTS, VODI tracks unique new tenant tour requirements of office properties in core U.S. markets. It&#8217;s intended to serve as an early indicator of upcoming office leasing activity and track new tenant demand.
