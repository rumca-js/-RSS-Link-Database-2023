Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is almost upon us (its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mw3-how-to-get-early-access-modern-warfare-3-9328">campaign early access</a> <em>is</em> upon us for those eager enough to have pre-ordered the game), and official system requirements are pointing to an absolutely behemoth install size of more than 200GB in some cases come its full launch next Friday, 10th November - and Activision has now moved to explain what's going on.
</p><p>
In a <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1720119892697821399?s=20">statement shared on social media</a>, the publisher blamed Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3's potentially massive hard drive footprint on an "increased amount of content available Day 1", which includes open world Zombies, support for items being carried forward from Mo

After a week that's seen significant layoffs at Bungie, as well as reports of a delay for Destiny 2's The Final Shape expansion, the studio has told players "we know we have lost a lot of your trust" and promised to reveal plans to "take us all out of this Darkness and into the Light."
</p><p>
Reports of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-developer-bungie-latest-playstation-studio-to-be-hit-by-layoffs">widespread layoffs at Bungie</a> began circulating on Monday, and were later confirmed in statement from studio CEO Pete Parsons. Bloomberg later reported around 100 employees - approximately eight percent of Bungie's 1200-strong workforce - were affected by the job cuts, and that the layoffs followed internal warnings that studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-reportedly-warned-employees-of-sharp-drop-in-destiny

Payday 3 has had a bit of a rough ride since its launch back in September; <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-players-endure-second-consecutive-day-of-server-issues-preventing-them-from-playing">matchmaking issues</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-requires-an-always-on-online-connection">online-only requirements</a>, and a hugely unpopular challenge-focused progression system immediately soured its arrival for players, and a highly anticipated first patch promising "200+" quality of life improvements has been repeatedly delayed. Finally though, the heist-shooter's 1.01 update is here.
</p><p>
Payday 3's 1.01 update was initially planned to launch on 5th October, but developer Starbreeze <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3s-first-promised-patch-delayed-to-ensure-its-stability-now-arriving-mid-october">

The second season of HBO's The Last of Us adaptation is currently expected to enter production in early 2024.
</p><p>
That's according to HBO boss Casey Bloys (as reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-production-1235773579/">Variety</a>), who shared the news during an HBO press event held in New York earlier today.
</p><p>
Bloys remarked that the recent WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes meant production on the upcoming season had been delayed. This was first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-reportedly-on-hold-due-to-writers-strike">suggested as a possibility earlier this year</a> and has since been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-showrunner-shares-production-update-as-wga-strikes-look-set-to-end">confirmed by members of the sho

## The Talos Principle 2 review - a thought experiment to puzzle over

The premise of The Talos Principle 2 is a springboard for a number of thought experiments. In a post-human Earth, you have a thousand robots who think, feel and act exactly like humans, without ever having met one or sharing their history. Are they doomed to repeat the same mistakes? The fear that they are is the justification behind limiting their numbers to exactly one thousand, and you play as that one thousandth robot, starting on the day of their creation. It should be a momentous occasion, but instead it's the catalyst for unhappiness to bubble to the surface - and, apparently, for the vast spectre of Prometheus to summon you to a nearby island stacked with puzzles.
</p><p>
For the first third of The Talos Principle 2, I thought I had a good grip on what it was doing. The puzzles are short and light, and feel like a vehicle for the m

The Sims 4 team has lifted the lid on its upcoming expansion pack, known as Rent. As you may have surmised given its title, this pack will allow players to give property ownership a whirl, and become a landlord. 
</p><p>
"Revel in the hustle and bustle of Tomarang, discover unique items at the Night Market, and come home to a new Residential Rental lot where your neighbours are closer than ever," the pack's official description reads. EA and Maxis describe this new location as a "scenic world nestled in a lush tropical landscape and vibrant city skyline". It does look rather nice, I have to say.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, as you will be - in the Sims team's words - closer than ever, this will mean bumping into neighbours left, right and centre. When you collect your post, they will be there. When you join in with a po

Sega has had its best financial performance for a decade, reporting total net sales this year of &yen;389.6bn.
</p><p>
The figures come as part of a complete <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/ir_2023_web_all_e.pdf">report</a> into Sega Sammy's 2023. Financial figures show from 2014 - 2023, with the past year having the highest figures of all for net sales, operating income, and ordinary income across the entire business.

</p><p>
Sega Sammy reports consolidated sales grew "significantly" by 21.4 percent, owing to growth in its Pachinko Business and Entertainment Contents Business (games and films).

It's rare to notice a new Football Manager's tweaks as quickly as I did with FM24. It's March 2025, two-and-a-half seasons into my traditional Manchester United rescue job, and deep into a four-way title race between us, City, Chelsea, and Liverpool. First game of my freshly-imported save from FM23 - and so first game in FM24 - and it's City away. A potential early title decider at the Temple of Doom. In a charitably patient mood I have a quick tinker with my freshly reset set pieces - least I could do, given they've reworked the system, I tell myself graciously - but faced with several pages of UI within UI, executive dysfunction wins out and I give up for now to just get to the game. How much difference could it make in one match?</p><p><em>Four goals difference</em> is how much, reader. City score three in 35 minutes fol

Bandai Namco has revealed a brand new character for Tekken 8. Meet "living legend" Victor Chevalier from France.
</p><p>
"Descended from a lineage of distinguished knights, with a dream to rescue those in need, he followed the footsteps of his father and enlisted in the French Navy before joining the UN following his will to save more people," Victor's official bio reads. "As he felt the world was on the brink of being taken over by a corporate giant, he founded and trained the Raven Force - armed forces that have the authority to act at their own discretion to counter the corporation's private armed forces."
</p><p>
You can see him in action, kitted up with a variety of optical weapons, a very sharp suit and insults such as "bon app&eacute;tit", via the video below.

The CEO of Silent Hill: Ascension developer Genvid has  defended the game's transactions, and said they were there to allow people to "skip time" in gaining in-game currency rather than being a way to "game the system".
</p><p>
CEO Jacob Navok's comments come after the game's second night of new content, and amid <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-ascension-fails-to-impress-with-greedy-monetisation-and-cluttered-ui">backlash to its monetisation</a> scheme. </p><p>

After a surge of investment between 2020 and 2022, money funnelled into the video game industry from private equity sources has now dropped dramatically, back to and even below previous pre-Covid levels.
</p><p>
Data published by <a href="https://www.konvoy.vc/content/gaming-industry-report-q3-2023">Konvoy</a> as part of its Q3 2023 Gaming Industry Report show a sharp decline in investments following the second quarter of last year. 
</p><p>
As noted by EA Dice senior game designer <a href="https://twitter.com/JanDavidHassel">Jan David Hassel</a>, who shared these graphs on social media, investment in gaming surged to $14.78bn in 2021, and to 14.49bn in 2022. In 2023, this has now slumped to $2.09bn - around "a seventh of the investment of each of the previous two years".

With this update in play, those making their way through the game's many acts can expect to see many improvements across the board, but some particular highlights include the ability to now customise hirelings' appearance when recruiting them and the addition of a colour blind mode.

Elden Ring was by far and away one of the most prolific games of last year. It won itself scores of praise and accolades following its release in February 2022, including topping Eurogamer's own Game of the Year list.
</p><p>
This success has left many travellers to the Lands Between eager for more. Thankfully, current word is that Elden Ring's previously announced DLC expansion is "proceeding smoothly", despite developer FromSoftware not yet announcing any kind of time frame for its arrival on platforms.

This information comes from FromSoftware's parent Kadokawa, via gaming consultant Dr. Serkan Toto. Sharing this <a href="https://twitter.com/serkantoto/status/1720008197753512320">update</a> on X (formerly known as Twitter), Toto also added that Armored Core 6 has "sold 700k units in Japan" as
