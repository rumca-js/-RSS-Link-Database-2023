It&#8217;s not perfect in my experience, but when it works seamlessly, it feels like a glimpse of the future, or perhaps a scene from the movie Her. So what are the prospects for integrating ChatGPT voice interactions into other types of hardware, including dedicated devices like smart speakers?

The tech giant is working with 13 cities around the world — with Seattle being the first in the U.S. — to help optimize traffic lights and make traffic flow more efficiently. Google&#8217;s ultimate goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles stuck in stop-and-go traffic. The Google Research initiative relies on artificial intelligence and driving trends from Google Maps to model traffic patterns and make recommendations for optimizing existing traffic light plans.

Seattle entrepreneur Si Katara launched Tapp Finance in February. The company provides tools to help people sell call options against shares they already own. Selling call options lets investors collect small amounts of premium income. They face risks if a stock price surges beyond a call strike price. Tapp Finance makes money by charging a 0.48% annual fee. The 2-person company registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission in September and rolled out two proof-of-concept applications&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/seattle-fintech-startup-aims-to-help-everyday-investors-sell-call-options/">Read More</a>

Announced Monday morning at an OpenAI developer event in San Francisco, GPTs can be created through natural language conversations.

A 60-second commercial titled &#8220;Joy Ride&#8221; features three older women seated on a park bench, watching with a sense of familiarity and longing as children play on a sledding hill. One of the women turns to Amazon to purchase seat cushions for sleds, and after the package arrives she gets her friends back in on the fun of hitting the hill. The spot is set to an instrumental rendition of The Beatles’ song “In My&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/amazon-holiday-ad-captures-the-joy-of-friendship-and-sledding-at-any-age/">Read More</a>

Trilogy Equity Partners, where he serves as managing director, has continued to invest at a steady pace of about one equity deal a quarter through all the turmoil of recent years. &#8220;There&#8217;s an ebb and flow in the availability of good ideas, the availability of capital, and the availability of talent,&#8221; Stanton said Wednesday in Seattle. &#8220;And right now, I think there is a good opportunity to invest in new businesses.&#8221; Artificial intelligence&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/building-a-startup-in-the-age-of-ai-john-stanton-on-capital-markets-regulation-and-consolidation/">Read More</a>

It was a PR disaster and the mission was largely thwarted: only two of the seven candidates supported by Amazon won. Four years later, Amazon is working from a different playbook. This time Amazon is mum on city council endorsements. It&#8217;s banned from donating thanks to legislation approved by the council in January 2020 prohibiting &#8220;foreign&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/amazon-is-mum-on-upcoming-seattle-elections-after-riling-up-city-council-races-4-years-ago/">Read More</a>
