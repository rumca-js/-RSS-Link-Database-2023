## Ibsen’s Ghosts: a resounding flop that still returns to haunt us

<p>Despite being panned as ‘a dirty act done publicly’ on its London premiere, the tragedy is now regarded as a classic – here are three productions that radically shifted our perspective</p><p>Today most of us believe in Ghosts so we forget what a rough ride Ibsen’s play initially had. In the early 1880s it was brutally rejected not only by the theatres in Ibsen’s native Norway but by all the major European playhouses. Even more crucially for Ibsen, who depended heavily on the income from his play-texts, the published edition was a resounding flop: of the 10,000 copies printed, most remained unsold.</p><p>Now, of course, Ghosts is seen as a classic and, by a happy chance, its revival at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse will be followed in the West End by Thomas Ostermeier’s production of <a href="https://anenemyofthepeople.co.uk/">An Enemy of the People</a>: the play written immediately after Ghosts in which Ibsen vented his fury at the stupidity of his fellow countrymen.</p> <a href="ht

<p>Alexandre Silberman’s dreamlike portrait of Diena was praised by judges for its blend of the traditional and contemporary</p><p>It is an image of stillness in an increasingly chaotic world: a young woman sits in a park, immersed in nature and music. And it has caught the mood of the times, becoming the winner of the 2023 Taylor Wessing Photo Portrait prize.</p><p>Judges awarded Alexandre Silberman the prestigious £15,000 prize for his picture Diena, which was taken in Paris’s La Courneuve Park. The winning portrait forms part of Silberman’s series Nature, which explores the intersection of human interventions and the natural world. Judges praised the image for its blend of the traditional and the contemporary, juxtaposing historical depictions of a Madonna with modern signifiers such as the sitter’s nose ring and headphones. The titular Diena, sitting for her first ever professional photograph, is wearing a floral blouse which appears to blend in with the park’s surrounding lawn.<

<p>Crying gives us permission to open up, let down our guard and embrace those things that make us feel vulnerable</p><p>About a decade ago, I realized people were often crying around me. I saw folks crying in surprising settings (a guy crying in an art supply store), people crying in what turned out to be common settings (many people cry while jogging), people crying while doing something mundane (one guy while eating a corn muffin, a few others while vaping). I wanted to know their stories. Why were these people crying? Were they in the middle of an intractable conflict? Did they just get terrible news? Had they made it to the other side of a seemingly impossible situation?</p><p>I started tweeting these random encounters with tears on the streets of New York. To my surprise, tens of thousands of people started liking, retweeting and commenting on my tweets, or dm-ing me about their own crying encounters. Everybody cries, obviously, and so these things resonate. When you’re the one

<p>Nineteenth-century technology is finally being phased out in New York City, but its past is deeply entwined with American history</p><p>Until recently, my girlfriend and I lived in a steam-heated apartment in Manhattan. A creaky former tenement building, it had no radiators, just scalding-hot cast iron pipes that punched through the units like fire poles. The pipes terminated a few inches from our ceiling with valves that hissed and sputtered, leaking rusty orange water. And they weren’t just heaters, but alarms, clanking like pots and pans every morning around 6.45am when the boiler flipped on in the basement.</p><p>This 19th-century technology certainly heated our apartment – but far too well. So every wintertime we would have to throw the windows wide open just to cool down.

Charlie, dark and scowling, is a scrappy preteen whose single mother has no idea how to deal with her extended absences from their shack-like home at the edge of a wood, while Astrid, fair-haired and timidly polite, inhabits a cosy middle-class world of family dinners and indulgent shopping trips (there is never a wrong time for a new dress). They are, in other words, total opposites, and at school Charlie affects hardly to know Astrid, keen to keep up appearances in front of the boys who bully them both. When the day is done, however, they’re clandestine friends, united by an uncommon unhappiness and the terrifying pact it has brought them to make.</p><p>Look back on adolescence, and it seems like a bad dream – or a serious illness.
