It's a sobering statement that stars like the sun, more accurately all stars will die eventually—yes, even the sun. Don't panic, though, we still have a good few billion years to go so you will get to the end of this article. The more massive stars die as the dramatic supernovae explosions and when they do, they send a burst of neutrinos across the universe. Astronomers now think it's likely there is a background of neutrinos across the cosmos and that one day, we will be able to map the historical distribution of supernova explosions, may be even by 2035.

In 1916, famed theoretical physicist Albert Einstein put the finishing touches on his theory of general relativity, a geometric theory for how gravity alters the curvature of spacetime. The revolutionary theory remains foundational to our models of how the universe formed and evolved. One of the many things GR predicted was what is known as gravitational lenses, where objects with massive gravitational fields will distort and magnify light coming from more distant objects. Astronomers have used lenses to conduct deep-field observations and see farther into space.

Dust is the most vital organ in galaxies. It absorbs and scatters stellar light, a phenomenon that is referred to as dust attenuation. On the other hand, dust emits this absorbed radiation thermally in the infrared. Normally, dust emits a similar amount of energy as it was absorbed from stars. This relation between dust absorption and emission, is called the energy balance.

Humans wouldn't last long without plant mitochondria and chloroplasts. These essential compartments of plant cells famously capture sunlight and power plant life—and so, ultimately, provide all the food we eat. But there's a problem: Mitochondria and chloroplasts store instructions for their building blocks in their own "organelle" DNA or oDNA—and this can get mutated.
