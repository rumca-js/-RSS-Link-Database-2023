  <p id="qETIyG">There are now 1 million paid subscriptions to creators on Instagram, slowly transforming the platform into a space where creators can get paid directly by their fans. It’s a big milestone but a small number for Instagram: the service has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834571/instagram-2-billion-active-users">around 2 billion monthly users</a>. Patreon, meanwhile, is <a href="https://graphtreon.com/patreon-stats">estimated to have</a> more than 30 million paid subscriptions — albeit with about a decade’s head start.</p>

  <p id="qQkxkq">I’m a big first-person shooter fan, but I’m bored of the likes of <em>Overwatch</em>, <em>Call of Duty</em>, and <em>Valorant</em>.
