Others have been evicted by landlords or fired from jobs. The result is that Afghans believe they have no choice but to return to a country where they face a serious risk of harm. Iran, too, has <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/iran-afghan-migrants-expel-undocumented-taliban/32646949.html">repeated its threat</a> to expel hundreds of thousands of undocumented Afghans.

The day after the game, the club they’d beaten issued a Big Statement of their own, backing their manager who had gone on an impassioned and slightly unhinged post-match rant after seeing Anthony Gordon’s winner survive three separate VAR checks before being allowed to stand and calling for an end to the kind of “retrospective analysis” to which most of their statement was devoted.

Typically grouped with the photorealists who came to prominence in the 70s (although Eddy has distanced himself from the term), Eddy is known as a painter who is obsessed with light. Here that ethereal quality comes across as rich and gorgeous, otherworldly and quotidian all at once. Whether it’s sunlight radiating through a sky, pinpricks of windows on the NYC skyline, the delicate veins of a flower, or the saturated colors of Coney Island amusements, the light in this show feels uncommonly compelling and memorable.</p><p>The works in this exhibit mostly comprise street scenes Eddy photographed while taking lengthy walks throughout New York City during the early days of that city’s Covid lockdown. “Because

I was overcome by nostalgia as she took my measurements, moving around my body with her tape measure. During childhood my mum made my ballet costumes, and my first communion in primary school was preceded by a visit to a dressmaker. But as I stood in the tailor’s studio I realised it had been decades since someone had taken my measurements, to make something just for me.</p><p>That commercial dressmaking has faded, particularly in Anglophone cultures, is a reflection of how dramatically our relationship to clothes has changed.

<p>As society has renewed its desire to be cruel, we turn inward to our comforts, looking for warmth</p><p>A few weeks ago, I moved out of the crumbling home I’d built for myself in a dilapidated Sydney sharehouse, and found myself living alone for the first time. The shock of being by myself was bruising. I walked around the rooms of my new home, idly picking things up and putting them down again. I was, quite suddenly, forced to confront something I’d long known, but tried to ignore – sometimes you have nowhere to turn but yourself.</p><p>I don’t think I’m alone in that reckoning. The vibes, as they say, are bad out there – the world appears to have renewed its desire to be cruel. And so many of us turn inward, seeking shelter, and instead finding, terrifyingly, <em>us</em>. Faced with that gnawing ache of self-reflection, unsure of what else to do, I put on the 2008 motion picture Mamma Mia!</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/21/sign-up-for-

One of their number is badly wounded, the lad who has the money has vanished, the woman next door knows one guy’s real name (because he told it to her), and the livewire of the group has kidnapped a witness and stashed her in the boot of their getaway car. Naturally, said witness turns out to be the treasured daughter of a ferocious local crime boss. What more could go wrong? Plenty, because in addition to being a heist-gone-wrong, this is also a horror movie, with comic aspects.</p><p>This all sounds potentially very entertaining, if hardly original, and it’s a shame Wickedly Evil can’t live up to the reliable genre thrills promised by the premise.

It was hard to argue. His team conceded two goals inside the opening eight-and-a-half minutes that should never have been possible.

They suffered blisters, burns or temporary blindness and 2,308 of them died. In July 1918, the Ministry of Information sent American society portraitist John Singer Sargent to the front.

<p>We focus on friendships, but encounters with those we hardly know are vital too</p><p>The stranger struck up conversation on a delayed flight between Florida and New York. We were both struggling to entertain our toddlers, and we commiserated awhile. After the children fell asleep, he told me he’d recently left the Mormon church. He said he missed the community and the certainty he once felt.

<p>I’ve done a tea-and-biscuit survey of the country’s cultural institutions and high-street chains – and I’m afraid we’re being taken for mugs</p><p>It’s odd to be mocked by baked goods, but that’s exactly what happened recently when I took a break from working in the reading rooms at the British Library for an afternoon pick-me-up of sugar and caffeine. There, peering up from the counter of the library cafe, was a beige doubledecker biscuit with marzipan teeth and goggly eyes called a “monster cookie – raawrr”. It was priced at £5.95. A simple cup of tea to go with the snack cost £2.25, meaning that for both, you’d be pushing a tenner. That grinning biscuit was taking the piss.</p><p>These extortionate prices are not unique to the British Library. I took my toddler to the National Maritime Museum, and ended up spending £7.80 on tea and a bit of cake to take the edge off being up since 6am. Cakes are luxuries we can do without, but the prices of hot drinks in our leading cultural in

Hugh Grant’s prime minister sits in a grand yet cosy drawing room at No 10, alone on Christmas Eve, rifling through holiday cards in his red despatch box. He comes across one from Natalie (Martine McCutcheon), the tea lady he’s been pining for since their first, expletive-filled meeting. “If you can’t say it at Christmas, when can you, eh?” she writes. “I’m actually yours.”</p><p>This statement of devotion, lovely in its smallness, precipitates Grant’s more memorable response, knocking on every door on her street in “the dodgy end” of Wandsworth until he finds her.

This is how a folktale from Piedmont, told by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/italocalvino">Italo Calvino</a>, begins.

Where the stone fell, they would find a partner.</p><p>The first stone, of the eldest son, landed on the roof of a bakery, and the second on the house of a weaver, while the stone of the youngest’s landed in a ditch.

She was three months old, rolling around on the back seat between me and my twin brother, Michael (we’d just turned seven), and wasn’t enjoying her first trip in a car. She could have been sick anywhere – over the seat, over the floor – but for some reason she decided to climb on to me first.</p><p>It was the start of a beautiful but strangely one-sided friendship.

Vegans. But above all I despise vampires.” That’s Dolph Lundgren in a growl, wearing a ludicrous wig, and karate-kicking his way through a horde of undead. Lundgren plays ageing action star Claude Luc Hallyday, a veteran of trashy films with trashier titles (Moses v the Nazis!). It’s a supporting role but Lundgren is the main attraction in Orson Oblowitz’s misty-eyed, sentimental, sometimes silly love letter to cinema. The setting is a gorgeous movie palace where the owner has a thing for tough guy Hallyday, watching his 80s action flicks on repeat – funny pastiche clips shot here as little movies-in-a-movie.</p><p>To be fair, Terrence Howard is also pretty terrific as cinema proprietor George, whose family have owned the Grand since it opened in the 1920s.

The theme of tonight’s congregation at the San Fedele Cultural Centre, however, is not evangelism but electronic noise.</p><p>The 57-year-old Jesuit priest, a tall and thin figure with a crucifix around his neck, is presenting an evening of music by experimental electronic composers Maryanne Amacher and Tim Hecker, a Canadian whose ambient instrumentals veer between bliss and terror. The worshippers, silently seating themselves inside the newly renovated auditorium, are university students, electronic music fans and metalheads. Next month, Pileggi will host a concert by Nine Inch Nails’ keyboardist Alessandro Cortini, who will play on a s

It has been delightful to see the elite struggle at Kenilworth Road and, in Liverpool’s case, almost coming a cropper.

The atmosphere was electric, too, with 10,000 Bedfordshire voices urging on their team. Unfortunately, the ground’s tight confines betrayed the subject matter of some unseemly songs from certain Luton fans. Tragedy chanting is a relic that belongs in the era when Luton were last in the top division. Songs mocking poverty on Merseyside are especially ridiculous when Luton’s unemployment rate is above the national average and that in Liverpool. Meanwhile, the residential area surrounding the stadium betrays visible deprivation in a town where life is often hard. The loudmouths we

Officially unveiled this summer by the first lady, Olena Zelenska, the bronze assemblage depicts a young boy and girl in the guise of angels, apparently embarking on a winged ascent to heaven. To my taste, it is a triumph of kitsch, whose sentimentality is out of step with the profound tragedies it commemorates. Still, when I visited, little offerings of toys had been left at the statue’s base: evidence that many people disagreed, and found it a useful focus of contemplation.</p><p>Ukraine’s landscape of memory is in a state of flux.

<p>The wife of poet George Barker ought to be better known and this book should be on every bedside table – to cheer, reassure and inspire</p><p>Elspeth Barker could write about anything and have you longing for more, which makes it sad that she wrote so little: we need to cherish every word that has survived of her. She was the wife of the poet George Barker and, in the ways that count, a poet herself – although in prose. When she died, in 2022, she had published one wonderful novel, <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/o-caledonia-9781474620512">O Caledonia</a></em>, about a wayward 16-year-old girl growing up in a Scottish castle. Described by Ali Smith as “one of the best least-known novels of the 20th century”, it became, once republished, a classic more than a collector’s item. She also produced clever, witty, unpredictable journalism and we now have this selection of essays, chosen by her daughter, Rafaella Barker. <em>Notes from the Henhouse</em> is a book for which one

<p>Emma Seligman reveals how she made this outrageous romp about schoolgirls setting up a fight club in order to bed cheerleaders – and explains why a ‘really gay’ Marvel movie might be next</p><p>Bottoms is a high school movie stuffed with all the great high school movie tropes. There are nerds and jocks, slow clappings, grand gestures on the football field, graffitied lockers and a sad montage that unfolds to the sound of Avril Lavigne’s Complicated. But its leads are PJ and Josie, the “ugly, untalented gays” who set up an after-school fight club with the sole aim of having sex with the cheerleaders. Girls punch each other in the face, teachers read porn magazines in class, everyone pretends to be “empowered” – and, somehow, it still manages to be a feelgood delight. Thrillingly, it may be the least earnest film I have seen in years.</p><p>Its director, 28-year-old Emma Seligman, is in London, explaining how a comedy about amoral, horny teen lesbians gets made.
