Slow Motion in film used to be intentional, powerful, and story driven.  Slow Motion was meant to shine light on emotion and impact for certain sequences.  Though, in today's filmic landscape, Slow Motion has become more a gimmick than a story telling device.  Whether it's every Matrix Ripoff attempting bullet time, or most of the Zack Snyder led DCEU, Slow Motion has inflated run times, and caused a slow death to an effect that used to mean something.
