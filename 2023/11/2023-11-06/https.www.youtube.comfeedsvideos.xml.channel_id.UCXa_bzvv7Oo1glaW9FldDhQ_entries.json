Though combat remains as fun as ever, in spite of how short Haus is, it feels too repetitive and drawn out, thanks in large part to its rote and uninspired mission objectives. Yes, this remains an absolutely gorgeous game to look at, but this is still a disappointingly unambitious expansion that sticks to the script a bit too slavishly.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_v8EFAdAZU", "date_published": "2023-11-06T17:00:17+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/P_v8EFAdAZU/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "EA Sport WRC Review - The Final Verdict", "description": "For a racing license that has passed through multiple publishers and developers over the decades, WRC has probably found its best fit yet with Codemasters. The developer is no stranger to rally racing titles, and EA Sports WRC is perhaps its most feature-packed rally sim yet.\n\nFrom a fully fleshed-out Career Mode and Championships to the new Moments for recapturing iconic races, not to mention over 200 stages, there is a lot that the game has to offer. You can jump into Time Trials and try to perfect your run, with the overall racing feeling better than ever, or dive into Builder Mode to create the rally machine of your dreams.\n\nEA Sports WRC is available for Xbox Series X/S, PS5 and PC.
