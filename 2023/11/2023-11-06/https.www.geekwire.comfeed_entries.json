It&#8217;s not perfect in my experience, but when it works seamlessly, it feels like a glimpse of the future, or perhaps a scene from the movie Her. So what are the prospects for integrating ChatGPT voice interactions into other types of hardware, including dedicated devices like smart speakers?

Seattle entrepreneur Si Katara launched Tapp Finance in February. The company provides tools to help people sell call options against shares they already own. Selling call options lets investors collect small amounts of premium income. They face risks if a stock price surges beyond a call strike price. Tapp Finance makes money by charging a 0.48% annual fee.

A 60-second commercial titled &#8220;Joy Ride&#8221; features three older women seated on a park bench, watching with a sense of familiarity and longing as children play on a sledding hill. One of the women turns to Amazon to purchase seat cushions for sleds, and after the package arrives she gets her friends back in on the fun of hitting the hill.
