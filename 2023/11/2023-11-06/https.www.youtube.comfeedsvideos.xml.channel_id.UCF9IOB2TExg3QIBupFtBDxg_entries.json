The relatively small scale, and working through a small number of known individuals allows us to avoid problem of corruption which have been associated with some projects in the past. \n\nI visited this Buwanda in Uganda last year and personally confirmed the work being done. For example, this is a \u2018health camp\u2019 we conducted during my stay, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCfFLUTENp4\n\nIn addition to direct medical work, we also help local food security by growing crops and milling maize corn. The profits made from milling are used to sustain poor local children, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHhPA_9unFo&", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2Rvjt-UN5c", "date_published": "2023-11-06T20:15:02+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Dr. John Campbell", "album": "Dr. John Campbell", "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/Q2Rvjt-UN5c/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}]
