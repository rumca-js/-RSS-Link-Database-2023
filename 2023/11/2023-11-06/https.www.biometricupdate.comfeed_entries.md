		A digital cash flow lending tool meant to facilitate access to loans for rural women in Nigeria is said to have “yielded promising results,” and there are now plans to expand the innovative financial inclusion technology.

According to an <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/psd/scaling-innovation-expanding-we-fis-digital-cash-flow-product-across-africa">article</a> on the World Bank’s blog, the digital tool was developed by the Bretton Woods institution in collaboration with Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative (We-Fi) and two commercial banks.

Designed specifically to respond to credit needs of women-led small and medium-sized enterprises (WSMEs), the digital cash platform enables users to avoid the hurdles that often face women applying for loans.

		The police in Scotland have tripled the use of retrospective facial recognition over the last five years jumping from just under 1,300 in 2018 to nearly 4,000 in 2022.

The rising trend has continued during 2023 with more than 2,000 searches carried out in the first four months of the year, <a href="https://theferret.scot/police-scotland-accelerates-use-facial-recognition/">according</a> to data obtained by a freedom of information request by UK investigative journalism organizations Liberty Investigates and The Ferret.

The trend has been rising in other parts of the country. In 2014, the total number of searches using retrospective facial recognition by all police forces in the UK amounted to just 3,360. By 2022, that number jumped to 85,158, according

		German telecommunications giant Deutsche Telekom has brought on two new customers for its digital identity wallet as it pushes its strategy in digital IDs.

The company’s digital transformation-focused subsidiary T-Systems will supply the ID wallet for <a href="https://www.gxfs.eu/">Gaia-X Federation Services</a>, a major European initiative for trusted data sharing. The wallet was commissioned by the German trade group eco - Association of the Internet Industry and the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action.

The service will be available to the Gaia-X at the beginning of next year. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) technology plays a special role in the wallet with users in control of their digital ID credentials, the company says in a release.

		A 2019 biometric privacy lawsuit in the U.S. against Amazon has just gotten more significant. A U.S. district judge last week said the plaintiffs can include everyone who has used Amazon's Alexa web service.

Amazon <a href="https://www.law360.com/articles/1739210/attachments/0">lost a bid</a> October 31 to have its Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act <a href="https://jnswire.s3.amazonaws.com/jns-media/57/87/1434457/19ch7777.pdf">case</a> dismissed. Plaintiffs argue that Amazon violates BIPA when Alexa records and analyzes a person's voiceprint without first getting consent.

In asking for the dismissal, Amazon's attorneys said Alexa buyers have to agree with documentation stating that their voices will be recorded when using the service. The judge said, however

		The number of scams targeting Australia’s MyGov digital identity scheme has “increased dramatically," with losses reaching AU$3.1 billion (US$2 billion) so far this year, according to the country’s government.

Thousands of myGov accounts are being suspended over fears that they have been compromised by so-called “scam-in-a-box” kits sold on the dark web, Government Services Minister Bill Shorten said on Monday. The technology is used to create fake websites and help criminals launch phishing attacks on Centrelink, Australian Tax Office and Medicare accounts, The Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/nov/06/scam-in-a-box-mygov-suspends-thousands-of-accounts-linked-to-dark-web-kits">reports</a>.

The expanding global digital economy and the convenience it provides have also led to greater risks of fraud, access to private information, and underage people viewing or purchasing adult material.

Biometric facial recognition and age estimation technology have matured considerably in the past few years and can provide powerful signals to help limit those risks. However, age estimation through biometrics is only as good as the machine learning and trained data behind the verification process.

It takes years to develop accurate biometrics. Facial biometrics can seemingly work across a limited-scale deployment but return poor results at larger scales.

But it’s important to ke
