Cities: Skylines 2 studio Colossal Order has pledged not to release paid DLC for its city building sequel until its heavily criticised performance issues have been "fixed to our standards".
</p><p>
Performance concerns have, of course, dogged Cities: Skylines 2 even before its release, with Colossal Order and publisher Paradox Interactive taking the unprecedented step of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-performance-has-not-achieved-the-benchmark-we-targeted-paradox-admits-ahead-of-launch">warning potential buyers</a> that it had "not achieved the benchmark we targeted" prior to launch - but then going ahead and releasing it anyway because "releasing now is the best way forward."

In the weeks since, Colossal Order has continued to chip away at Cities: Skylines 2's performance issues and bug

Burnout is now available on Nintendo Switch, but it's not the Burnout you think it is.
</p><p>
EA's Burnout Paradise Remastered has been on the eShop since June 2020. But now there's another Burnout game that's been added to the store not made by EA, but from publisher GameToTop Corp.
</p><p>
Burnout is, of course, a car racing game where players must "prove [their] mettle and rise through the ranks to become the Burnout champion," its <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Burnout-2476912.html#Overview">description reads</a>.

There's an embarrassment of riches in the 136th edition of DF Direct Weekly, spread across almost two hours of 'content'. We discuss the good and the bad points of the Modern Warfare 3 campaign and EA's WRC, we spend time talking about how impressive the Switch port of Super Mario RPG is and share impressions on Apple's newly announced M3 processor line-up. However, for this Eurogamer blog, I'm going to talk about what it's like to run Marvel's Spider-Man 2 on the slowest, quantifiably worst PCIe Gen 4 SSD 'upgrade' money can buy.
</p><p>
Long-time readers/viewers of Digital Foundry may recall that back in the day, when the PS5's M.2 bay was enabled, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-the-worst-and-best-nvme-ssds-tested-on-playstation-5">we stacked up the internal storage solution with the best and worst PCI Gen 4 S

## Fortnite's huge popularity spike is both brilliant and devastating

Fortnite has made a sudden return to its long-lost original map for a month-long mini-season fuelled by nostalgia, and its sudden spike in popularity has blown past everyone's expectations. It's a stunning moment for Epic Games' ever-changing battle royale - even by Fortnite's own stratospheric standards - and yet I can't help but feel a tinge of sadness that this is the version of Fortnite all 44 million players picked up on Saturday.
</p><p>
The game's first map is a special place, home to countless player memories and a string of wild and memorable live events, the likes of which haven't really been topped since. But it was also the game at its most basic and rough - a nimble but work-in-progress creation labelled as "Early Access" and built on-the-hoof as Epic Games quickly pivoted from Fortnite's initial PVE zombie shoo

## The Invincible review - gorgeous sci-fi that doesn't quite take off

When I look up at the stars, I feel wonder and mystery, and romance, even. I believe anything is possible out there and that we only have to find it. And when I look at The Invincible, it makes me feel that way too. You can see it in the screenshots. In hues that are almost gaudy, there are sweeping desert landscapes where huge finger-like rock formations reach out as if to try and scratch the surface of strange moons behind them. There are turquoise skies fading to starry black, and boiling oranges beneath them. It's like looking at a postcard of what space could be - a space of emotional warmth and feeling. I find it mesmerising.</p><p>This particular setting - this fiction - is based directly on a book written by Polish author Stanis&amp;lstrokaw Lem in 1964. It's a book by the same

## Retro Studios once canned a Portal-esque game because Nintendo didn't get it

Retro Studios was once working on a Portal-esque first-person puzzle game called Adept for the GameCube.
</p><p>
The studio began work on the game after Metroid Prime 3 and had a working prototype built in that game's engine, but Nintendo said no.
</p><p>
Until now, footage of the prototype hadn't been made public, but a new video from YouTube channel DidYouKnowGaming has revealed Adept - as well as fresh details on other cancelled games by Retro Studios.

Embracer's chief operating officer has left the company, amid a wave of restructuring and studio closures.
</p><p>
Announcing his departure on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7127206123555745792/">LinkedIn</a>, Egil Strunke said he had "reached a checkpoint", before adding it was time for a new project.

"Last week I left Embracer Group as COO, and it's with mixed feelings I am parting ways [with] this global company phenomenon, rooted in Karlstad, Sweden," Strunke wrote. "On one hand grateful for having had the chance to work with the one-of-a-kind Lars Wingefors [Embracer's CEO] and all the other AMAZING colleagues (too many to mention!) which I will be sad to leave. On the other hand excited about the opportunities that lie ahead - starting and building my own

Eiji Aonuma, known for his long-running work on Nintendo's Legend of Zelda series, is to be awarded a knighthood in France.

The Nintendo exec has been named a 'Knight of the Order of Arts and Letters' by the French Minister of Culture.

The impact of Elden Ring is still being felt as one modder has put the iconic Malenia into Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.
</p><p>
Chinese modder Last孤影众  (G&amp;umacryǐng zh&ograve;ng) has created the Land of Reeds mod, which - among other changes - adds the rot boss to Sekiro, which YouTuber Ongbal tested out last month (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/one-determined-modder-managed-to-cram-elden-rings-hardest-boss-into-sekiro-and-she-hardly-seems-to-stand-a-chance/">PC Gamer</a>).
</p><p>
Yes, that means parrying every hit of Malenia's Waterfowl Dance attack. That alone is quite the feat, though Ongbal's Wolf is more than a match.

Two Diablo 4 developers have dropped a big hint about a previously-denied secret cow level in the game fans have been searching for.
</p><p>
As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4-players-are-hunting-for-a-non-existent-secret-cow-level">previously reported</a>, Diablo general manager Rod Fergusson stated there's "no secret level", but this hasn't stopped fans from hunting for one. There was seemingly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4-players-make-apparent-breakthrough-in-hunt-for-secret-cow-level">a breakthrough made last month</a>, too, after a player acquired a mysterious relic that required killing exactly 666 cows.

Now, at this weekend's BlizzCon 2023, production director Tiffany Wat and associate game director Joe Piepiora hinted the secret cow level might be real after all.
