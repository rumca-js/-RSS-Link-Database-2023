In this video, we take look at some awesome emulators running natively on the Oculus Quest 2 also known as the Meta Quest 3. We test out PS2 using AetherSX2, Gamecube using the Dolphin emulator, N64 using RetroArch, and PSP using PPSSPP. The Quest 3 to is powered by a Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 CPU backed by 8GB of ram and overall it's a pretty powerful stand-alone VR headset the best part is it runs Android so side loading our favorite emulator is pretty easy.
