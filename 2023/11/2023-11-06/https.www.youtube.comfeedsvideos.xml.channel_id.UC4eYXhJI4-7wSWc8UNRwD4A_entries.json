A documentary film crew followed the band into our lobby and kept rolling tape as the players unpacked their instruments, sat down to warm up and joked ceaselessly among themselves.\n\nThe reason for all the fuss was to mark the final days of the nearly 50-year career of one of modern history\u2019s most durable, beloved and prolific chamber ensembles. Just two days after we captured this performance, the band played its final concert together in New York, where it all began in 1976 when a couple Juilliard students thought putting together a string quartet might be a fun idea. Forty-some albums, nine Grammys and countless concerts later, we were honored to document one of the band\u2019s last performances.\n\nTypical for the Emersons, the music they chose was wide-ranging. A dash of Haydn served as a witty amuse-bouche, then on to a mini-movement from late in Beethove", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQjo5pxpC88", "date_published": "2023-11-06T10:00:26+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "NPR Music", "album": "NPR Music", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/MQjo5pxpC88/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}]
