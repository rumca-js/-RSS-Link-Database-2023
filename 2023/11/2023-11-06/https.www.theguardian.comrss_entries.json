The day after the game, the club they\u2019d beaten issued a Big Statement of their own, backing their manager who had gone on an impassioned and slightly unhinged post-match rant after seeing Anthony Gordon\u2019s winner survive three separate VAR checks before being allowed to stand and calling for an end to the kind of \u201cretrospective analysis\u201d to which most of their statement was devoted. As entitled and pompous as it was pitiful, it was obviously lapped up by Gooners on various Social Media Disgraces but greeted with a mixture of rolled eyes, bemused bafflement and ridicule by folk who don\u2019t sleep in Gunnersaurus-branded jimmy-jams.</p><p>Fluminense won the Copa Libertadores on Saturday in dramatic fashion, edging out Argentina\u2019", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/06/football-daily-mikel-arteta-arsenal-newcastle-rant-mistakes-happen", "date_published": "2023-11-06T16:02:17+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "The Guardian", "album": "The Guardian", "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/guardian-logo-rss.c45beb1bafa34b347ac333af2e6fe23f.png", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Parkinson\u2019s patient able to walk 6km without problems after spinal implant", "description": "<p>Marc, 63, had freezing of gait before becoming first with advanced Parkinson\u2019s to be fitted with device restoring normal signalling</p><p>The first patient to receive a spinal implant to treat advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease has described experiencing \u201ca rebirth\u201d after the treatment allowed him to walk again without falling over.</p><p>Marc, 63, from Bordeaux, France, was diagnosed with the degenerative disease more than 20 years ago and had developed severe mobility problems, including balance impairments and freezing of gait.
