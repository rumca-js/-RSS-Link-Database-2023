We have two main projects we are supporting at the present time: 

The first is the Buwanga Way to Health Foundation, https://buwanga.org

This is a registered NGO in Uganda we have started three years go. The relatively small scale, and working through a small number of known individuals allows us to avoid problem of corruption which have been associated with some projects in the past. 

I visited this Buwanda in Uganda last year and personally confirmed the work being done. For example, this is a ‘health camp’ we conducted during my stay, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCfFLUTENp4

In addition to direct medical work, we also help local food security by growing crops and milling maize corn. The profits made from milling are used to sustain poor local children, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHhPA_9unFo&
