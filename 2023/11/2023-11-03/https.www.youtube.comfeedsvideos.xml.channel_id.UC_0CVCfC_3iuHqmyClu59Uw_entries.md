In this video We Turn the Lenovo Legion Go Handheld into a Desktop PC! The Lenovo Legion Go handheld is a great way to game on the go, but it can also be used as a desktop PC. With a little bit of tinkering, you can connect an external GPU to your Legion Go and get desktop-class performance.
In this video, I show you how to connect an RTX 4090 and RX 7600XT to your Legion Go and use it in desktop mode. This will allow you to play the latest games at the highest settings and even do some video editing or 3D rendering.
