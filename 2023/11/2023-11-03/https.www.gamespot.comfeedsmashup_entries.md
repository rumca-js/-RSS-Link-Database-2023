<p>Blizzard has revealed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4's</a> first major expansion, Vessel of Hatred, which is set to release in late 2024. The reveal came alongside a short teaser trailer, which showed off a region returning from Diablo 2.</p><p>Revealed during BlizzCon, Vessel of Hatred, which features a green logo instead of the typical red, will follow Mephisto and his "demonic plans for Sanctuary" after the events of Diablo 4. The expansion takes place in the Kurast region, which is a jungle-filled region and appears to be inspired by South America. It was originally featured in Diablo 2.</p><p>The teaser trailer didn't show much beyond the thick jungle setting, but Blizzard did tease that the expansion would feature a brand-new class for the Diablo series. A datamine, which appears to be accurate based on the announcement, suggests that the class will be called Spiritborn, possibly another magic focused class.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/

<p dir="ltr">When it launched in 2020, Ghostrunner was quickly recognized for its slick blend of satisfying first-person parkour platforming and tough-as-nails, one-hit-kill combat. Perhaps most impressive was just how well it practiced restraint, never overstaying its welcome while also keeping the focus keenly on its engaging traversal and action. Ghostrunner II is a sequel that hasn't entirely lost the captivating nature of its core gameplay loop, but in expanding the world that you're playing in and trying to find new elements to introduce into the mix, it loses itself along the way at times before finding its feet once again.</p><p dir="ltr">Ghostrunner II takes place a year after the events of the first game, with cyborg assassin Jack now comfortable in his role as enforcer for the Climbers, one of many gangs trapped in the cyberpunk tower of Dharma. While the original Ghostrunner had a story, it wasn't a core focus, instead simply providing some context to keep you moving forw

The world of The Boys wonders what the world would be like if superheroes were actually real. The answer always ends up being "terrible."

<p>Ahead of its US release on December 1, a new trailer has gone live for Godzilla Minus One. Like the previous trailer, this new teaser of the monster movie only offers a handful of new Godzilla footage, but when the king of the monsters appears, he brings untold devastation with him.</p><div>          </div><p>Set in post-World War II Japan, Godzilla Minus One follows several characters as they witness the arrival of Godzilla in a country that is still reeling from its defeat in the global conflict. With its army a shell of its former self, its navy in the process of being dismantled, and the US refusing to step in and assist Japan in case it provokes the Soviet Union into a new war, Japan is on its own and unprepared for Godzilla.</p><p>That doesn't mean that Japan isn't ready to fight back against Godzilla, but when you're facing a bipedal engine of mass destruction, there's only so much that conventional weaponry can do against the rampaging kaiju.</p><a href="https://www.gamesp

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> OG has taken us back to the Chapter 1, Season 5 version of the battle royale island, and this shortened, 30-day season comes with a shortened 50-level battle pass. But despite having far less content than a normal pass, with half as many skins as usual and no collaborations, Epic is charging the normal price--950 V-bucks--for it anyway. While that may be annoying, especially after Epic raised the price of V-Bucks last week, the short length of this season means that Fortnite Crew can help dull the sting a bit--a single month's subscription will net you both the Fortnite OG pass and the next pass, presumably for the season that will be called Chapter 5, Season 1.</p><p>The way Fortnite Crew works is that for $12 per month, you get 1000 V-Bucks, a skin, an accompanying set of cosmetics, and the current battle pass if you don't already have it. But it's built to let you game the system a bit--you can earn every Fortnite

Here's how it's all going to work.</p><p dir="ltr">Fortnite Chapter 1 Map returns in Season 5 form, but it won't last long. This shortened version of a Fortnite season will include weekly hotfixes (patches you don't have to download) that will reimagine the island every single week for the next month.</p><p dir="ltr">On November 9, the island will resemble that from Chapter 1 Season 6.

That makes the Fortnite OG weapons and loot pool an assortment of nostalgic items for some players and excitingly fresh for others.</p><p dir="ltr">What's even more interesting is that this season's short runtime of just one month means updates to the loot pool will come more often, with major changes hitting every Thursday through the end of the month to reflect different seasons from Chapter 1, beginning with the Chapter 1 Season 5 look the island and its loot has today.

At just one month long, Fortnite OG includes lots of changes that are atypical for a Fortnite season launch. For one, the shorter season means a smaller battle pass, officially called the OG Pass, which includes 50 tiers of throwback rewards, as opposed to the usual 100+.</p><p dir="ltr">Secondly, the update cadence is much more frequent.
