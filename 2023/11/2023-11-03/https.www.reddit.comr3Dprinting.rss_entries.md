I want to go up to at least 180 grit.</p> <p>But it's taking HOURS. Hours and hours and hours. I've been sanding the two pieces for a few hours in the evening for a few days now, so I'm easily up to 7hrs of sanding and I don't feel like land is in sight.</p> <p>Am I doing something wrong? I printed it using normal PLA, layer height is fine, layer lines aren't bad. Could my sand paper be low quality?
