Rather than telling the story of the titular ship, however, The Invincible instead tells the story of Yasna, who is trying to figure out what happened to her crew a few days before the arrival of The Invincible.

Just about every interaction between its characters can often turn into incredibly interesting conversations about philosophy and science. Couple that with the fact that the mysteries presented in the game are incredibly interesting, despite the game’s plot being relatively simple, and you have one of the more interesting narrative titles out this year.
