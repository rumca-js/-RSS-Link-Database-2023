BlizzCon is back - as an in-person event for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzcon-returns-this-november-for-its-first-in-person-event-since-2019">first time in four years</a> - and Blizzard kicked off its opening ceremony with a bit of an Overwatch 2 blowout, including a reveal for the series' 39th hero, chaingun-wielding tank Mauga.
</p><p>
Mauga's announcement wasn't, admittedly, much of a surprise, giving he inadvertently got a pre-show unveiling on Switch's eShop news channel, but he's now been made official thanks to BlizzCon. And, as seen in his reveal trailer, Mauga - which means "mountain" in Samoan - is armed with two chainguns: affectionately known as Gunny and Cha-Cha.
</p><p>
Gunny is an incendiary chaingun, whose bullets will burn enemies that receive sufficient damage; Cha-Cha, meanwhile, is a a "volatil

BlizzCon has bought big news for World of Warcraft fans as the MMO prepares to celebrate its 20th anniversary next year: Blizzard have unveiled not only the game's next next expansion but the two coming after that, all forming the initial chapters in the newly unveiled Worldsoul Saga.
</p><p>
The Worldsoul Saga was enthusiastically unveiled by Blizzard veteran Chris Metzen, who returned to the company early this year after departing in 2016. This new World of Warcraft story arc will play out across multiple expansions over the next few years, starting with The War Within - WoW's tenth expansion - coming in 2024.
</p><p>
The War Within takes players into heart of Azeroth itself, where they'll explore new subterranean kingdoms, engage with ancient cultures like the Earthen Dwarves - a new Allied race - and the terrifying Nerubian

## Diablo 4's first expansion is Vessel of Hatred and it's coming "late 2024"

With this year's BlizzCon now firmly underway, Blizzard has been whipping up the crowds with a bunch of announcements during its Opening Ceremony, including initial details on Diablo 4's first expansion. It's called Vessel of Hatred and it's due "late" next year.
</p><p>
Vessel of Hatred - said to still be "super early" in development - continues the story of base game antagonist Prime Evil Mephisto, and introduces a new region to Diablo 4: the lush jungles of Torajan, last seen in Diablo 2.
</p><p>
Blizzard isn't saying much more about Vessel of Hatred just yet but it does tease that it'll feature "new ways to play", "new evils to vanquish", plus a new class never before see in the Diablo universe. There's also a (not especially informative) teaser trailer to accompany the news.

If you've ever paused mid-slaughter during a game of Vampires Survivors and thought to yourself, 'Yes, but what's my <em>motivation</em>?', you'll want to ready yourself for the minimalist survival RPG's next free update. As per studio Poncle's latest development update, a new story driven, lore-infused Adventures mode will soon be on the way.
</p><p>
Poncle has teased Adventures before, describing them as a remix of content adding a bit of extra "flavour" through new stage progression and descriptions. Now though, via the medium of FAQ it's gone into <a href="https://poncle.games/adventures-faq">considerably more detail</a>, explaining Adventures are essentially self-contained miniature story campaigns - some available as part of the base game, others tied to specific DLC - that'll follow the game's cast of Survivors

## Almost 20 years later, cancelled Daredevil: The Man Without Fear video game prototype surfaces online

Fresh footage as well as a playable prototype of a cancelled Daredevil game have appeared online.
</p><p>
Known as Daredevil: The Man Without Fear, this prototype was initially conceived all the way back in 2004, but the full game was never released. It has since come back into circulation, however, with the prototype being shared online by an anonymous developer who worked on it almost 20 years ago.
</p><p>
You can find this Daredevil prototype, along with several screenshots, over on <a href="https://hiddenpalace.org/Daredevil:_The_Man_Without_Fear_(Mar_22,_2004_prototype)">Hidden Palace</a>. According to the notes included with the prototype, The Man Without Fear was being developed for the PC, PS2 and Xbox, and was set to be a "third-person beat 'em up" style game.

In the two years that followed, a wealth of overwhelming evidence has essentially confirmed that they were right. The T239 is an advanced mobile processor, based on an octo-core ARM A78C CPU cluster, paired with a custom graphics unit based on Nvidia's RTX 30-series Ampere architecture, combined with some backported elements from the latest Ada Lovelace GPUs - and with an all-new file decompression engine for fast engine. It also supports Nvidia's console-specific graphics API, all but confirming that it's destined for the next generation Switch.

## Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol. 1 is anything but masterful

The idea is certainly enticing on paper: for &pound;50/$60, Konami promises us seven main entries in the series in one package for current-gen and last-gen consoles plus PC. </p><p>The content here is not the issue. We get the PS1 classic MGS, with the VR missions pack included, we get MGS2: Sons of Liberty and MGS3: Snake Eater, with enhancements from the later Substance and Subsistence versions. And to sweeten the deal, there's the MSX2 releases of Metal Gear and Metal Gear2: Solid Snake, while both NES Metal Gears make a rare appearance too for a series collection. That takes us from the series' inception in 1987 right up to MGS3 in 2004, with room for a Master Collection Volume 2 to expand beyond that. </p><p>There are omissions of cours

## Xbox users call out Activision and Microsoft for "vomit inducing" full-screen Modern Warfare 3 ad

Activision and Xbox have teamed up to release full screen ads for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 on the console's homepage, which players have since heavily criticised.
</p><p>
As shared by multiple users on social media, the ad in question pops up when players boot up their Xbox. "Fight against the ultimate threat," the screen proclaims. 
</p><p>
It then suggests you perhaps buy the game ahead of its full release later this month (as a reminder, you can play the Campaign early if you pre-order). Your three options are simply "Buy Now", "Get the Vault Edition Upgrade" and, mercifully, the option to "Exit" away from this ad and get on with what you actually booted up your Xbox for.

## Game of the Week: Football Manager, realism, and the need to leave some gaps

I've been thinking a lot about realism recently - in part because I've been playing an awful lot of Football Manager 2024 (probably a lot more than I really needed to for the review, but keep that between us), and FM is nothing if not an attempt to make very fake looking football feel very real. 
</p><p>
It's also a very specific kind of realism, though, a kind we don't always get in games. Or maybe a kind we do get quite often, but don't always value as much, or talk about as much, as the other kind. Typically we think of realism, I've found, in two ways. One is appearances, which is natural for a medium that's as visual as anything, and also utterly infatuated with raw graphical progress: how realistic are Naughty Dog's animations? How close a recreation of downtown D&uuml;sseldorf is this, from my bird's eye view in Flight Simu

## The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria review - diamonds amongst the rough

I, for one, am thrilled that we are currently seeing a spate of weird and wonderful games set in Middle-earth. Although these games take creative risks that don't <em>always</em> work out, it's fascinating to see how developers can interpret Tolkien's legendarium in ways that are a little bit unexpected. And it's particularly exciting when a game focuses on a specific location or people in Middle-earth to really explore them in detail. (Pencil <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cosy-lord-of-the-rings-game-tales-of-the-shire-announced-coming-2024">that cosy Hobbit game</a> releasing next year into your diaries.)

There's a new Blizzard game available today, very slightly earlier than planned.

Warcraft Rumble is the company's new free-to-play tower defence strategy title for mobile devices, featuring a cast of familiar faces from the World of Warcraft universe.

Originally <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzards-new-warcraft-mobile-game-is-free-to-play-tower-offence-arclight-rumble">announced last year as Arclight Rumble</a>, Blizzard's latest effort arrived on app stores last night, a day ahead of this evening's big BlizzCon opening ceremony.

Lords of the Fallen has received a new patch with over a hundred changes, including buffing various bosses.
</p><p>
Players complained that some of the game's bosses were too easy - this is a challenging Soulslike after all - but now the likes of the Sanctified Huntress, Griefbound, the Sundered One, and "a boss at the bottom of a very dark place" will be more formidable.
</p><p>
What's more, the Scarlet Shadow has been made more difficult to cheese - that's the reaper who chases players in Umbral. Now, he no longer takes fall damage and players can no longer hide and shoot him from above.
