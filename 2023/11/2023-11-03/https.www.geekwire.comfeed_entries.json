That&#8217;s one question to arise in the wake of the Amazon&#8217;s founder announcement Thursday that he&#8217;s taking his talents to South Beach. Washington state lawmakers recently passed a controversial 7% capital gains tax for gains of $250,000 and up to fund early-childhood education programs and school construction. Bezos has sold billions in Amazon stock over the past several years. The state for years has also debated different versions of a wealth tax. With a net worth of $160 billion, Bezos would be impacted as&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2023/jeff-bezos-move-out-of-washington-state-sparks-questions-about-wealth-taxes/\">Read More</a>", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2023/jeff-bezos-move-out-of-washington-state-sparks-questions-about-wealth-taxes", "date_published": "2023-11-03T19:36:20+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GeekWire", "album": "GeekWire", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://www.geekwire.com/wp-content/themes/geekwire/dist/images/geekwire-logo-rss.png", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "title": "Substance over style: Seattle startups facing fewer down rounds than Bay Area, NYC counterparts", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"817\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/seattleskyline2018-1260x817.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />Seattle startups are facing fewer down rounds than companies in the Bay Area and New York City, signaling a slightly more modest retrenchment in the Emerald City amid the broader tech market downturn. Through the nine months ended September, about 12% of funding rounds in Seattle resulted in lower valuations, compared to the Bay Area&#8217;s 17% and New York&#8217;s 24%, according to data provided to GeekWire from equity management company Carta. That compares to a national average of about 17%. Down rounds, which describe funding raised at lower valuations than previous rounds, have plagued many early-stage companies in 2023 amid&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2023/substance-over-style-seattle-startups-facing-fewer-down-rounds-than-bay-area-nyc-counterparts/\">Read More</a>", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2023/substance-over-style-seattle-startups-facing-fewer-down-rounds-than-bay-area-nyc-counterparts", "date_published": "2023-11-03T18:05:00+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GeekWire", "album": "GeekWire", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://www.geekwire.com/wp-content/themes/geekwire/dist/images/geekwire-logo-rss.png", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "title": "Seattle cloud giant F5 lays off 120 employees", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"473\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/f5.jpg\" width=\"630\" /><br />Seattle-based application security and delivery giant\u00a0F5 this week laid off 120 people, the company confirmed to GeekWire.", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2023/seattle-cloud-giant-f5-lays-off-120-employees", "date_published": "2023-11-03T17:29:47+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GeekWire", "album": "GeekWire", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://www.geekwire.com/wp-content/themes/geekwire/dist/images/geekwire-logo-rss.png", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "title": "Brinc delivers first Lemur 2 drones to U.S. public safety agencies", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"489\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/keynote_HD_blue_021523_2-1260x489.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />Seattle-based public safety technology startup Brinc this week delivered the first production units of its Lemur 2 drones to police and other emergency responders in the United States. The company, led by CEO Blake Resnick, says it has made a series of upgrades to the Lemur 2 since it was unveiled in March, including improvements in its antenna range, and better self-righting and obstacle avoidance capabilities. Brinc&#8217;s drones are able to see in the dark, communicate through a microphone, and break through glass, among other features.
