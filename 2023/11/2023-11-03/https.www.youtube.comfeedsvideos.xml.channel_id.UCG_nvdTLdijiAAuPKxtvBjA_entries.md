Mission Impossible 7: Dead Reckoning Part 1 sends Tom Cruise against his worst enemy yet: ChatGPT. And as you may have expected from Fallout, the movie is pretty damn good. One of the best action movies you'll see this year, and even though it flopped at the box office a bit, that was mostly due to Barbenheimer. And since Dead Reckoning is great for a lot of the same reasons I've covered before, today let's focus on its ability to seemingly cheat time itself. The movie simply begins and then suddenly ends, without ever letting you go. So in today's Film Perfection, let's see how you can do it too.
