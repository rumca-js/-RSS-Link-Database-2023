<p>After a mum despaired of children’s toys’ failure to represent disability, she went on to create a glorious, colourful television series. This is her story</p><p>Seven years ago, I sat at my desk and asked myself some big questions. Could I devise a children’s TV show which bursts from screens like a candy store of creativity? One that is bright, sweet and funny, capturing the magic of play and the limitless ability of young children to transcend reality and disappear into their own imaginations? Could I play with the conventions of children’s programming – which had historically excluded 150 million disabled children worldwide – and draw on my own experience as a disabled person to create a world so tangible that little fingers would long to reach in beyond the screen and hold the cute stop-motion characters in their hands?</p><p>These questions led to the creation of Mixmups. It’s a new 52-part series about three friends – Pockets the bear, Giggle the cat and Spin the rabbit – w

Is this revamp really needed?</p><p>Disney’s live action take on the classic 1937 animation Snow White won’t be hitting multiplexes until at least 2025 thanks to the recent writers’ strike, so you might wonder why the studio has chosen this week to publish a <a href="https://twitter.com/SnowWhiteNews/status/1719135130487275829/photo/1">first still of the famous princess surrounded by her seven faithful homunculi</a>. It could be because the House of Mouse simply wants us to know that this thing is still on, despite all the weirdness surrounding it. And let’s make no mistake, the furore around this movie really has been downright weird from the beginning.</p><p>Somehow, Snow White has managed to get on the wrong side of “anti-woke” crusaders on both sides of the Atlantic, <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2023/07/21/wee-man-rips-disney-snow-

Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, the Spurs coach reminded those listening just how driven NBA players are. So, with a chance at winning the new NBA Cup, Pop says teams will rise to the challenge.</p><p>“You have to understand all these guys are very competitive,” Popovich says of the NBA workforce. “If you put something out there like this, it just adds to that competition.”</p> <a href="https://w

It’s a bit like taking a big gulp from a mug of tea to which someone has added three sugars. You expect it from an amarone and from wines that carry the description <em>passito</em> or <em>appassimento</em> on the label, because that indicates they have been fermented on partially dried grapes to add extra sweetness.</p><p>Certain wine regions tend to produce sweeter reds as a matter of course: Puglia’s primitivo and negroamaro, for instance, and some cheaper wines from the Lisbon region; California reds, too, tend to be sweeter than most European ones, as do some Georgian reds, because it’s a style that was traditionally popular in that country’s former main export market, Russia.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/nov

<p>If it can retake its place at the high table of Middle Eastern politics, the Kremlin would be harking back to the Soviet Union’s superpower glory days</p><p>On 26 October, a Hamas delegation headed by politburo member Mousa Abu Marzouk turned up in Moscow for talks that – according to Russian readouts – focused on the safety of Russian citizens in Gaza and the release of hostages. The Russians kept tight-lipped about the real purpose of the visit. The simultaneous presence in Moscow of Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Ali Bagheri Kani – who also met Hamas – suggested a troubling degree of coordination between Hamas on the one hand, and Russia and Iran on the other.

<p>Helen MacNamara’s quietly devastating evidence to the Covid inquiry reminded me how desperately we need more women channelling their anger into politics</p><p>It’s a bleak reflection on 2023 that the Covid inquiry – painstakingly detailing how sloppy, hubris-fuelled mismanagement led to thousands of deaths – passes for light relief in current affairs, but it sort of does. I feel bad enjoying any element of the back-stabbing, score-settling and general squirming: it’s a reminder of how noisy, macho gamification of public life characterised the Johnson administration and of the quiet private tragedies that accompanied it.

<p>From the steepest A-road in the UK to a stunning circuit of the Lake District, our tipsters share their best hop-on, hop-off road trips</p><p>The <a href="https://www.morebus.co.uk/services/WDBC/50">No 50 Purbeck Breezer</a> travels regularly between Swanage and Bournemouth past the beautiful beaches of Studland Bay. Behind Knoll Beach there’s a heathland nature reserve with a lagoon and a giant natural sand pit. In Poole we visited the Japanese garden at <a href="https://www.comptonacres.co.uk/garden/japanese-gardens/">Compton Acres</a> and the historic harbour. From a child’s perspective, the best thing about the No 50 is that it goes on a boat: the <a href="https://www.sandbanksferry.co.uk/timetable/">chain ferry</a> that plies the harbour mouth between Studland and Sandbanks. The return trip at sunset on the open upper deck made us laugh out loud: it was like being on a rollercoaster. <br /><strong>Jenny Lunnon</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/nov/

<p>Compact, non-spiny and with large luscious flowers, this Tex-Mex native will suit any home</p><p><strong>Why will I love it?</strong> <br />The <em>Astrophytum asterias</em> is one of my favourite plants; I find its form intriguing and beautiful. It is a flat barrel cactus without the typical covering of spines. Instead it is adorned with a rare feature: a tiny speckled tuft of hairs. Its allure is amplified by large yellow flowers, with orange throats often dwarfing the plant itself. Its name is inspired by its resemblance to a sea urchin without spines.</p><p><strong>Light or shade?</strong> <br />It thrives in bright direct/indirect light, soaking in the sun’s energy to display its full natural splendour.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/nov/03/houseplant-of-the-week-sea-urchin-cactus">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar is revered as a founder of modern India and for his work fighting the caste system. A new documentary looks at his lasting popularity</p><p>There may only be a few people outside the subcontinent who have heard of Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar. But as one of the founders of modern India, he was a revered scholar who championed the rights of Dalits, while his work as a civil rights leader has been likened to that of Martin Luther King Jr in the US.</p><p>A new film aims to revive the memory and the message of Ambedkar, affectionately known as “Babasaheb”, who was born a Dalit – the lowest rank of India’s caste system – but became an activist who helped draft the post-independence constitution, worked as an economist and a politician, and is now revered as a Buddhist saint.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/nov/03/hed-be-horrified-at-discrimination-today-new-film-revives-message-of-indias-dalit-champion">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Academics express unease over government ambition to replace once-a-decade snapshot with ‘other sources of data’</p><p>The first official census in Britain was conducted at a time of great national insecurity. Amid failing harvests and a war with France, MPs were concerned that the country could run out of bread to feed its population. The problem was, nobody knew how big that population actually was.</p><p>And so, on 10 March 1801, the first census of England and Wales was held (it counted 8.9 million people, roughly equivalent to the current population of London). Census questions may have changed somewhat in the interim – no longer are respondents asked if they are a “<a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/storyofthecensus/">lunatic, imbecile or idiot</a>”, as was the case in 1871 – but every 10 years since, with only one wartime interruption in 1941, a similar survey has been conducted to take a snapshot of the nation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2

## King and Country review – Joseph Losey’s brutal reflection on the futility of war

<p>Tom Courtenay is unforgettable as a first world war private on trial for desertion. But it is Dirk Bogarde, dripping with distaste for his defendant who delivers a horrific coup de grâce</p><p>There’s an extra, unexpected shiver of contemporary relevance and horror in this rerelease of Joseph Losey’s brutal expressionist drama from 1964. Tom Courtenay plays the pinch-faced, talkative but also somehow inscrutable Private Hamp, who is court-martialled for desertion in 1917 having “gone for a walk” away from the guns at Passchendaele.</p><p>Dirk Bogarde’s suave, sorrowing Capt Charles Hargreaves is assigned the task of defending Private Hamp – suppressing his distaste for Hamp, of course, like all the officer class, and trying not to think about the inevitability of his execution – and he boldly asks the court to consider Hamp’s “mental health”. The presiding colonel, played by Peter Copley, erupts with contempt at this modern-sounding phrase. “Do you mean the prisoner is a lunatic?”

Hundreds of rooks roosting in the cemetery trees splutter into the darkness. At 7.45pm on 5 November, St Michael’s church bells ring out in discord across the village of Shebbear, in rural west Devon overlooking the Dartmoor hills. On Bonfire Night here, there aren’t fireworks, there isn’t even a bonfire. Instead, there is a stone.</p><p>Beneath an ancient oak in Shebbear’s village square is the Devil’s Stone. It’s a sarsen – a foreign stone not from this area. The boulder is thought to be quartz composite, where the local geology is predominantly sandstone and shale. No one attending the ritual turning of the stone on 5 November is bothered what it’s made of. It’s that the stone is turned that matters.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/nov/03/turn-the-stone-to-keep-the-devil-away-bonfire-
