<p>I&rsquo;ll be in south eastern Europe this summer (of 2023) in late June and early July.</p>
<p>Specific plans are still in the air, but I&rsquo;ll be visiting Greece, Albania, Montenegro and possibly the European side of Turkey.
I&rsquo;ll also be in Kosovo, and while I know I have some fans in Serbia, I&rsquo;m not sure I can cross into Serbia proper easily since the US accepts Kosovo as independent, but I believe that being there would be an illegal entrance into Serbia in the eyes of the Serbian government.
Not sure about the specifics. You can elucidate me, but either way I&rsquo;ll be in the region.
If you guys start shooting each other, either way, that leg of the journey will be canceled so play nice until after this summer! ðŸ˜‰</p>
<p>I do know some people who live in or frequent the region.
Now is your time to <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/contact">contact me</a> if you&rsquo;ll be there then.
People I don&rsquo;t know are welcome to contact me if they want to arrange a small public meet-up, which I am theoretically open to.
I will be with other people in a group though, so don&rsquo;t expect to separate me from my group for too long.
I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;d come along if you&rsquo;re not creeps.</p>
<p>I have a short list of Orthodox Churches and monastaries I intend to visit
(although this is not a pilgrimage, and the people I&rsquo;ll be with are not Orthodox),
and also some other attractions.
Suggestions of places to go, whether natural or man-made, religious are secular are welcome.
Hints for good and cheap living in the region are invited as well, since I&rsquo;ll again be with several people and I want to economize for everyone since we may be around several weeks.
I think for a good portion of the time, we&rsquo;ll just be hanging out in the area.</p>
<p>Contact me quick though, because we&rsquo;re about to start buying tickets and making concrete plans and such.</p>
