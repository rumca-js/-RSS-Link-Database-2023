There will be three nights of concerts, each featuring three bands, on consecutive nights beginning Jan. 24 at 8 p.m. ET. The globalFEST team wrote the following biographical information about each performer.\n\nSepteto Santiaguero, Cuba\nSepteto Santiaguero was founded in 1995 by members of Melod\u00edas de Ayer, a group formed in the early 1960s, together with the Estudiantina Invasora and the Cuarteto Patria, had for over three decades animated many a day and night at the Casa de la Trova in Santiago de Cuba. In 1993 and 1994, a number of young musicians from other septets \u2014 such as Sones de Oriente and Septeto Luz \u2014 joined Melod\u00edas de Ayer, and Fernando Dewar, a tres player, took over the leadership of the group. Seeking to return to their roots, the group decided to give up the mambos and stick to the discipline of the traditional septet: guitar, tres, bongo, clave, maracas, acoustic bass and trumpet, with the addition of the drum, which it retained in honor of Arsenio Rodr\u00edguez. In the Santiago de Cuba style, the two singers maintain the first and second harmony with equal emphasis. The group preserves and pays homage to one of Cuba\u2019s most important musical forms, with a vitality demonstrating that the septeto tradition is still fresh and alive in Santiago de Cuba today.\n\nSET LIST\nInocencio Heredia Castillo: \"Y Sigo Pa'lante\"\nRudens Matos Matos: \"Recuerdos del Ayer\"\nIgnacio Pi\u00f1eiro: \"La Meneadera\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nFernando E.
