<p>The Liverpool manager is left trying to build a new era while continuing to win – it is possible if he is given time</p><p>With 11 minutes left in this FA Cup fourth-round tie and the score 1-1 Jürgen Klopp could be seen racing out to the touchline, yanking the snood from his face and performing a series of furious scything gestures with his right arm, as though trying to break free from some invisible set of manacles.</p><p>Klopp shrieked. He threw his head back. Just as quickly he stopped, crouched, and mooched back towards his seat. Nothing was really happening. Klopp was reacting to the shapes in his head, seeing danger, slackness, loose stitching in Cody Gakpo’s off-the-ball positioning during a lull in play with the ball 40 yards away, out there urging his false-10 central attacker to stand 10 yards deeper, trying to plaster some kind of attacking plan across this oddly angsty Liverpool team in real time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jan/29/liverpool-lost-in-transition-but-jurgen-klopp-could-be-their-golden-thread">Continue reading...</a>

## Why do hardly any straight men write about sex and dating? It's a sad tale | Imogen West-Knights

<p>Men do think about matters of the heart, but writing about it publicly could be seen as undignified</p><p>For every date a heterosexual woman goes on there is, for better or worse, a man there. But while women produce a wide and varied literature about this experience, from dating columns to films, there is hardly any personal writing by straight men about their sex, dating and relationship lives at all. There’s Karl Ove Knausgård. But you could list women writing in this genre for hours. Nora Ephron, Anaïs Nin, bell hooks, Elizabeth Gilbert, Dolly Alderton, Candace Bushnell, and so on.</p><p>Men date. Men fall in love. So where is the writing from men about these experiences? There are a few basic dating and sex advice columns aimed at straight men. Rhys Thomas writes <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7vqnw/body-confidence-without-going-to-gym">Hey Man</a> for Vice, Justin Myers <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/profile/the-guyliner">wrote one</a> at GQ for a while. Perhaps this is the masculine mode: anonymously ask a question, get a straight answer. Elsewhere, it feels like affairs of the heart are snuck into writing directed at straight men like vegetables into a child’s dinner. A recent New York Times article about the podcaster Scott Galloway <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/02/style/scott-galloway.html">noted that</a> he smuggled relationship content into advice about career paths. And of course, as so many young men are doing of late, you can dive headlong into the cesspit of woman hacking, care of professed misogynist Andrew Tate. But that isn’t exactly what I had in mind. </p><p>Imogen West-Knights is a writer and journalist based in London</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/29/hardly-any-straight-men-write-about-sex-and-dating">Continue reading...</a>

## Meg Baird: Furling review – a contemplative delight

<p>(Drag City)<br />Expanding her sonic canvas, the American singer-songwriter’s first solo album in seven years is well worth the wait</p><p>Given that she’s such a prolific collaborator, folk adventurer <a href="https://www.megbaird.com/">Meg Baird</a>, you sense, sometimes forgets she has a solo career to uphold amid all her side projects. <em><a href="https://ffm.to/furling">Furling</a></em> is her first solo album since 2015’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/21/meg-baird-dont-weigh-down-light-unceasingly-calm-atmospheric">Don’t Weigh Down the Light</a>,</em> and only her fourth in 16 years. Pleasingly, it’s well worth the long wait, in large part because the realisation of these songs feels more expansive than her earlier, more pared-back work, with Mellotron, synths – even drums – appearing alongside the more familiar acoustic guitar.</p><p>And what songs they are: opener Ashes, Ashes is an immersive, loose-limbed jam that’s underpinned by piano and backed by hypnotic, otherworldly wordless vocals. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBhdZPSW9YM">Star Hill Song</a> finds Baird’s gorgeous vocal floating unhurriedly above a meandering guitar motif that sounds like a gentler Mazzy Star. Twelve Saints has lyrics (“Cups in our hands, we stared at the distance/ Thinking about friends that we’ve lost”) that perfectly complement its contemplative delivery. The fluttering melody of the intimate Unnamed Drives – just voice and guitar – recalls Big Thief’s Adrianne Lenker at her most spellbinding. It’s a delight from start to finish. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/29/meg-baird-furling-review-a-contemplative-delight">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I don’t begrudge the comfortably off ‘silver quitters’ their good luck. But those of us who still have to work need their help on the barricades</p><p>‘Where have all the workers gone?” <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld5803/ldselect/ldeconaf/115/115.pdf">asked a House of Lords report</a> last month. The title evokes an image of peers looking around crossly for the 565,000 missing economically active people in much the same way I do for my nail clippers, but actually, the report is perfectly sensible and interesting. It covers Brexit and ill-health, but the trend that emerges most strongly is a reversal of the previous long-term one: people in the 50-to-64 age bracket are leaving the labour market. Spin the wheel of over-analysed work microtrends and you might not have expected to land on “silver quitting” (another report went for “the great retirement”, less catchily), but a growing body of evidence suggests that is exactly what has happened in Britain.</p><p>Why? It doesn’t look, from the research, as if it’s a question of ill-health or that they were pushed out; rather, it’s mainly “a lifestyle choice”. “These people express no desire to work and do not expect to work again” as the lords put it. <a href="https://www.thephoenixgroup.com/sites/phoenix-group/files/phoenix-group/Phoenix%20Insights/Publications/Phoenix%20Insights%20What%20is%20driving%20the%20Great%20Retirement.pdf">That “great retirement” report</a>, from the longer-life thinktank Phoenix Insights, also found “the main reason people in the UK were leaving the workforce was because they no longer wanted to work”. <a href="https://covidjobsresearch.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/pdf/over50sInactivity.pdf">Predictably, it’s middle and higher earners</a>, and <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/reasonsforworkersagedover50yearsleavingemploymentsincethestartofthecoronaviruspandemic/wave2#financial-resilience">two-thirds are mortgage-free</a>; you need financial security to make that kind of lifestyle choice.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/29/retired-early-and-wondering-what-to-do-how-about-fighting-for-the-rest-of-us">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Peaking plants are meant to be a backstop, but their profits and exemption from windfall tax are controversial in an energy crisis</p><p>At the entrance to the old munitions factory, a pair of ornamental lions stand guard, each with a stone paw resting on a cannonball. The Coryton complex in Essex dates back to 1895, and its use has changed over the years. Behind the lions loom the grey girders of a gas-fired power plant capable of generating electricity for up to 800,000 homes – and substantial profits for its owner. </p><p>Debate is raging over the role of gas-fired electricity in the energy crisis. Coryton is one of a fleet of UK peaking plants, so-called because they tend to be fired up at peak consumption times, a backstop when other contributors to the grid, such as windfarms, underperform. But they also attract some of the highest rates per megawatt hour (MWh) of any power source, and those rates have jumped with the gas price since the invasion of Ukraine,leading to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/nov/17/jeremy-hunt-windfall-tax-on-energy-leaves-several-billion-of-the-table">calls for their profits to be capped</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/29/gas-fired-plants-uk-lights-on-cost-profits-energy-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When a great white shark stole a flipper from freediver <strong>Callum Stewart</strong>,<strong> </strong>he felt terror, curiosity and a deep love for his family – all in the space of 30 seconds</p><p>A week before a great white shark took my diving fin, I went diving with nurse sharks on the New South Wales south coast. It was epic. I’ve always really liked sharks and was interested in seeing them in the wild. From what I’ve been reading and hearing, sharks are really not interested in attacking humans.</p><p>Days later, some divers and I headed out on a boat to Martin Island off Port Kembla. It was 13 January 2018 – I’ll always remember the date. It was a beautiful day, around 10am, the sun was out and the visibility underwater was at least 20 metres, which is unbeatable. So all the things people say about sharks, about how it’s dangerous to swim in low visibility, before dawn and after dusk, that was all out of the question.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/30/a-day-at-the-beach-the-shark-did-a-big-lap-around-me-thats-when-i-saw-my-fin-in-its-mouth">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From the disgraced former party chair to the Richard Sharp investigation, government failure stems from a network of private schools and elite universities</p><p>A country in deep crisis ought to at least have a government capable of governing; it is post-Brexit Britain’s unlucky fate to be run by an administration in a similar state of breakdown. The Tory party chair, Nadhim Zahawi, has been found to have committed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/29/nadhim-zahawi-sacked-tory-party-chair-tax-affairs-rishi-sunak">a serious breach</a> of the ministerial code and finally sacked.

Last Monday, Johnson <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/fresh-questions-for-boris-over-financial-advice/">said that Sharp</a> “knows absolutely nothing about my personal finances – I can tell you that for ding-dang sure”.

## Tom Verlaine: Television’s perfectionist guitar genius always kept punk guessing | Alexis Petridis

<p>A hugely gifted and original musician, Verlaine kept up the exacting standards in his solo career</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/28/tom-verlaine-frontman-and-guitarist-of-us-band-television-dies-at-73">Tom Verlaine dies at 73</a></li></ul><p>In 1975, Malcolm McLaren returned to England from a sojourn in New York with a selection of posters and set lists he had collected in the city. Ostensibly managing the New York Dolls, he had become enamoured of another band, who appeared to be kickstarting a new movement in the city. Television had been formed from the ashes of the short-lived Neon Boys by two childhood friends, Tom Miller and Richard Meyers, who had relocated to New York and renamed themselves Tom Verlaine and Richard Hell. Both frontmen and songwriters, the two appeared to be completely at odds with each other. Verlaine was aloof, introspective and a hugely gifted and original musician, whose playing entwined so completely around that of the similarly gifted Richard Lloyd that it was unclear who was the lead guitarist and who was on rhythm. Bassist Hell was a heroin addict who threw himself around onstage, spiked his hair, ripped his clothes and held them together with safety pins: one of his homemade T-shirts bore the legend “PLEASE KILL ME”.</p><p>In search of a gig, they had approached a club called CBGBs, lying to the owner that their sound fitted with the genres in the acronym of its name: country, bluegrass and blues. Given a Sunday night residency, Television began attracting appearances by other artists who shared their general discontent with the state of mainstream rock in 1974 and played, as Hell put it, “really powerful, passionate, aggressive music that was also lyrical”, among them Verlaine’s sometime lover Patti Smith and the Ramones. McLaren had been particularly taken with Hell’s look and his song Blank Generation: on his return to the UK, he alerted the group of young musicians he was vaguely involved with to both, presenting them with the posters and set lists he had accumulated. In response to Blank Generation’s title, the Sex Pistols’ bassist Glen Matlock wrote Pretty Vacant.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/29/tom-verlaine-television-perfectionist-guitar-genius-always-kept-punk-guessing">Continue reading...</a>

<p>(Hot Fruit/Virgin) <br />The former Supergrass frontman’s gorgeous, heartfelt new songs are intoxicating</p><p>It’s 30 years since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/jul/16/gaz-coombes-it-felt-good-that-life-was-speeding-up">Gaz Coombes</a> formed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/23/supergrass-on-tour-interview-weve-always-been-about-manic-energy">Supergrass</a>, the teen rock band who sold millions of their debut album, 1995’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/24/supergrass-how-we-made-i-should-coco-interview">I Should Coco</a></em>, and still draw big audiences for their reunion tours. So the genial Englishman has spent some two-thirds of his life being a rock star, and this fourth solo album proves he’s still pretty good at it. While Coombes isn’t keen on trying to recapture Supergrass’s sylvan magic in the streaming era – their final album, <em>Release the Drones</em>, remains unfinished and unreleased – he sounds as youthful and engaged as he did in those cassette tape days.</p><p>Much of the baroque experimentalism that powered <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/22/gaz-coombes-matador-review">Matador</a></em> (2015) and <em>World’s Strongest Man</em> (2018) has been dialled down, but the band’s intoxicating, questing spirit throbs through the strongest suite of music Coombes has assembled in 20 years. Gorgeous, heartfelt pieces dedicated to his wife and kids (Don’t Say It’s Over, Not the Only Things) nestle up next to heartfelt, gorgeous songs about lizard metamorphosis and murdered middleweight boxing champions. The latter, Sonny the Strong, brings the sharp edge of sadness and regret that has often studded his songs fully to the fore, and is one of the best things he’s ever done. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/29/gaz-coombes-turn-the-car-around-review-best-album-in-20-years-supergrass">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A cocktail created at Milan’s fashionable Bar Basso is turning  50, and the Instagram generation is lapping it up. We took a stool</p><p>It’s 7pm on a Saturday evening in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/milan">Milan</a>, and a large crowd has gathered outside Bar Basso. <em>Aperitivo</em> hour has only just started, but inside the tables are already taken. From well-heeled locals puffing on HeatSticks to fashion types carrying tiny dogs, everyone is holding the same rust-coloured cocktail.</p><p>A <em>negroni sbagliato</em> translates as a “wrong negroni” or a “mistaken” one. Similar to a real negroni (gin, vermouth and Campari), it swaps the gin for sparkling wine. And like an Aperol spritz, when ordering it’s advisable to truncate it – spritz there, sbagliato here – if you want to pass as true Milanese. Behind the bar, five bartenders fill cocktail mixers with ice, then free-pour the liquor into goblets the size of pineapples. They make so many each night, they refer to them as “sba” as shorthand.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/29/negroni-sbagliato-the-wrong-negroni-was-no-accident-and-it-tastes-fantastico">Continue reading...</a>

## Brutes by Dizz Tate review – a whip-smart and warped coming-of-age Florida fairytale

<p>A schoolmate’s disappearance is the hook for a slippery debut novel exploring the friendships and futures of a gang of eighth-grade girls</p><p>Dizz Tate’s debut novel, <em>Brutes</em>, opens with a disappearance: Sammy Liu-Lou, daughter of a famous televangelist and an enigmatic rebel with shaved hair. When her mother discovers her empty bed, one question echoes around this fictitious Florida town, “tickling” the surface of the lake that lies ominously undisturbed at its centre: “Where is she?”</p><p>Somewhat infuriatingly, Sammy is to remain a mystery, since this novel is not about her, but the gang of eighth-grade girls hunched behind binoculars at their bedroom windows, ogling her – and all other residents’ – every move. These are Tate’s “brutes”, who together make up the book’s sardonic yet vulnerably naive first-person plural narrator. Sammy’s vanishing is just one diversion in what reads like a literary house of mirrors, deliberately only scratching the surface of the dubious (and occasionally supernatural) carryings-on in this swampy, theme park-adjacent landscape. As a search party of evangelical groupies unfolds, the girls introduce us to a suspect cast of characters including Sammy’s cartoonishly villainous best friend, Mia who, alongside her mother and a man named Stone, recruit kids for their talent show Star Search.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/29/brutes-by-dizz-tate-review-a-whip-smart-and-warped-coming-of-age-florida-fairytale">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A starry cast including Jonah Hill, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Eddie Murphy can’t save this laboured update of Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner</p><p>The premise of 1967’s <em>Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner</em> is retooled for millennials in this sporadically funny but overstretched culture-clash comedy. Ezra (Jonah Hill, who co-wrote the film with director Kenya Barris), a Jewish investment banker, meets Black costume designer Amira (Lauren London) by chance – he mistakes her for his Uber driver. But from this inauspicious encounter, romance blossoms. Soon enough, they meet each other’s parents. Ezra’s mother and father (Julia Louis-Dreyfus and David Duchovny) tie themselves in mortifying knots to prove their liberal credentials. When Arnold (Duchovny) drops the name of rapper Xzibit into the conversation, it sounds suspiciously as though this is the only Black person he can think of. Meanwhile, Amira’s parents, particularly her father, Akbar (Eddie Murphy), are openly hostile to their daughter’s fiance. The first third of the picture is promising, if frequently excruciating. But the points are painfully laboured and the jokes run out of steam.</p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81194505">On Netflix</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/29/you-people-review-frequently-excruciating-culture-clash-comedy-jonah-hill-julia-louis-dreyfus-david-duchovny-eddie-murphy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>At a remote rural cottage, a spooky invasion from the little people rapidly descends into silliness</p><p>The latest addition to the rich seam of Irish folk horror – films such as <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/28/you-are-not-my-mother-review-irish-horror-kate-dolan">You Are Not My Mother</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/15/the-hallow-review-horror-corin-hardy">The Hallows</a></em>, which tap into the earthy regional mythology of malicious fae folk – <em>Unwelcome</em> takes a thuddingly basic approach to the “far darrig”, or little people, before unravelling into a wigged-out Hammer Horror-style climax in search of a coherent ending.</p><p>Pregnant Maya (Hannah John-Kamen) and her husband, Jamie (Douglas Booth), are understandably spooked by a violent home invasion in their London apartment. So when Jamie inherits a cottage in rural Ireland, it seems like the perfect solution. Jamie is enraged by the lackadaisical timekeeping of the builders, but Maya realises they have other, smaller problems. The unnerving high-pitched giggling from the woods and the requirement for daily “blood offerings” to the little people probably should have been a giveaway.

<p>I’m in London this month, and energy costs and inflation are hitting business owners hard. I don’t envy my UK counterparts</p><p>My wife and I visit London a few times a year to see her family and our friends from university. We’re here again this time for the entire month of January living as Londoners, staying in a rented house, taking out the trash – sorry, rubbish – and buying our food at Waitrose. The stay has given me time to observe, talk to people and walk around, and here’s what I’ve learned: I need to stop complaining about how difficult it is to run a small business in the US. It’s much harder to run a small business in the UK. Particularly now.</p><p>Imagine running a business where inflation isn’t <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cpi/#:">6.5%</a>, as it is the US, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/18/business/uk-inflation.html">10.5%</a>.

<p>The former Labour MP, now living with terminal cancer, has written a memoir of his colourful career. He talks about his faith, his contrarian spirit – and what he learned from his friend ‘Mrs T’</p><p>Frank Field thinks of his new book, <em>Politics, Poverty and Belief</em>, as his “death mask”. Partly because the memoir is his last word on the highly distinctive features of his singular, principled career. But also, awfully, because doctors told him that cancer would likely finish him before he finished it. When we met last week he was full of different emotions, but the principal one he expressed was perhaps blessed relief; that writer’s relief of having met his deadline, of having got it done.</p><p>We sit in the book-lined living room of the flat, on the top floor of the four-storey postwar block, half a mile from the House of Commons, that Field, now 80, has lived in since he first won his seat as Labour MP for Birkenhead in Liverpool in 1979. The cancer has affected his jaw and he finds it a struggle to talk, though the cheery determination of his voice is still very present. I ask him first, as you do, how he is.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/29/frank-field-politics-poverty-belief-cancer-labour-interview">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘I use it because it’s better’: why chefs are embracing the electric stove

<p>As evidence mounts that gas stoves are bad for human health, a growing number of professional chefs say electric even makes for a better cooking experience</p><p>The evidence that gas stoves are bad for human health has grown so staggering over the last few years that the US Consumer Product Safety Commission recently <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-09/us-safety-agency-to-consider-ban-on-gas-stoves-amid-health-fears">announced</a> that it would consider banning the appliances. Though a conservative backlash prompted the White House to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/12/biden-gas-stoves-republicans">rule out the possibility</a> of a nationwide ban, and some states have passed pre-emptive laws that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/politics/natural-gas-ban-preemptive-laws-gop-climate/index.html">prohibit cities from ever passing gas bans</a>, other cities including Berkeley, New York and San Francisco have already moved to bar new gas hookups due to health and environmental concerns.</p><p>One <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/1/75">study</a> from earlier this month found that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/06/us-kids-asthma-gas-stove-pollution">one in eight cases of childhood asthma</a> in the US is caused by gas stove pollution. According to the lead author on the study, Talor Gruenwald, a research associate at the non-profit <a href="https://www.rewiringamerica.org/">Rewiring America</a>, that means that living in a home with a gas stove is comparable to living in a home with a smoker. Gas stoves release pollutants so harmful that the air pollution they create would be <a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2020/12/gas-stoves-can-generate-a-startling-amount-of-indoor-air-pollution/">illegal if it were outdoors</a>, and that’s not just true when you’re actively cooking – gas stoves continue to emit harmful compounds like methane <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/climate/gas-stoves-methane-emissions.html">even when turned off</a>.

<p><strong>Hoddinott Hall, Cardiff</strong> <br />Thierry Pécou delivered a scintillating piano concerto grounded in Balinese tradition before Marzena Diakun presided over a moving eulogy to Bohemia</p><p>Starting point for this programme by the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/3YV0XMLfSTrsrtT8PdfYPNV/about-the-orchestra">BBC National Orchestra of Wales </a>was Debussy’s Prélude à l’après-midi d’un faune, often considered to mark the beginning of modern music. Evocatively played, it served too as a prelude to <a href="https://www.schott-music.com/en/person/thierry-pecou">Thierry Pécou</a>’s piano concerto, Cara Bali, conceived for <a href="https://www.askonasholt.com/artists/alexandre-tharaud/">Alexandre Tharaud</a> who gave its UK premiere here. The work pays homage to the Balinese gamelan tradition, and no one would have understood better than Debussy – whose experience of hearing Javanese gamelan players at Paris’s 1889 Exposition Universelle was so fundamental – why Pécou should be drawn to its sound-world. </p><p>Yet this was not simply the re-creation of the aura and internal structuring of a gamelan orchestra within a symphonic line-up, rather a way for Pécou’s musical imagination to take flight. As well as exploiting the piano’s percussive character in ostinato patterns, Pécou blended his instrumentals in sounds that were tantalising for not being what the ear initially seemed to perceive. </p><p>Available until Friday 24 February on <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m001h6l4">BBC Sounds</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/29/bbcnow-diakun-tharaud-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Lyric Hammersmith; Criterion; Park theatre, London</strong><br />Brute force speaks volumes in Frantic Assembly’s breathtaking Othello; Steven Moffat and co flirt with farce; and the story of Windrush boxer Vernon Vanriel hits home in song</p><p><a href="https://www.franticassembly.co.uk/">Frantic Assembly</a>’s roughed-up, seized-by-the-scruff-of-its-neck version of <strong><a href="https://lyric.co.uk/shows/othello/">Othello</a></strong> keeps shining new lights on Shakespeare’s play. When I first saw Scott Graham and Steven Hoggett’s adaptation 14 years ago, the switch of setting – to a pool bar in the 21st century – was invigorating, but the main excitement was the way the stage seemed to be expanding its vocabulary. Shakespeare’s words were there all right, but their meaning was danced as well as spoken.</p><p>In Graham’s new production, which is concluding a nationwide tour with a London run, the velocity and agility of movement is still breathtaking. Characters seem to lean on the air or be pushed by it; the atmosphere might be another cast member. The dynamics of the plot are evident before anyone speaks: Iago scissors himself between Othello and Desdemona; male bodies arch back and forward, as if tugged by gusts of violence; Desdemona and Emilia swivel towards each other for a chat, their limbs making a protective chamber as they bend together.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jan/29/othello-lyric-hammersmith-frantic-assembly-review-the-unfriend-steven-moffat-mark-gatiss-criterion-on-the-ropes-park-theatre-windrush-boxer-vernon-vanriel-dougie-blaxland">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Nourishing mushrooms and a rich, dark cake for these cold days</p><p>I am deep in the thick of winter cooking, where every meal owes its heart and soul to the grains and pulses in the cupboard and where sweet treats tend to come in the form of tobacco-brown cakes packed with dried fruit. I love this sort of cooking: brown rice pilaf and risotto, earthy, ochre-hued bean soups, and cakes spiced with black treacle, dried apricots and dates. Winter food for the coldest days of the year.</p><p>The store cupboard is working hard right now. The lentils and bulgur wheat, couscous and beans that sit quietly on the shelf all summer are getting their moment in the low winter sun. This week has seen a couple of bean soups on the table, a pilaf of brown rice and mushrooms. In the cake tin is an old-fashioned fruit loaf, heavy with brown sugar and sticky with dates. I kept it tightly wrapped, somewhat teasingly, for 24 hours before slicing, as you might a ginger or Dundee cake. It was worth the wait.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/29/nigel-slaters-recipes-for-mushroom-pilaf-lemon-and-mint-and-date-cake-with-miso-icing">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From police officers to politicians, people who are keen to occupy powerful positions should be treated with caution</p><p>At some point near the end of the last millennium, I was shown around Rome by two Roman Catholic friends of mine. The experience was a blur of churches, statues, paintings, fountains and mouldering palazzos interspersed with large quantities of pizza so crispy that it has slightly spoiled my every subsequent encounter with the dish. As with heroin, sometimes it’s better not to know what you’re missing.</p><p>It was an ecclesiastically skewed tour – the eternal city’s ancient and illustrious pagan republic barely got a look-in – but a lot of fun for someone like me who loves old stuff. I envied my friends their ability, in any given church, to identify the various saints by their telltale kit, like heroes from the Marvel universe. I swore I would develop the skill myself – it would make going around churches so much more fun – but all I seem to know now is that Saint Peter has keys and Saint Mark a lion, so I’m no closer to spotting Saint Boniface from his nunchucks or Saint Ethel from her basket of cheeses, or working out whether a stained glass window depicts the ascension, the annunciation, the transfiguration or the exfoliation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/29/the-reluctant-pope-is-a-valuable-lesson-in-public-service">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It may look like a world of spongy surfaces, bouncy walls and pits full of squishy balls, but the soft play area can easily reduce you to tears</p><p>My son runs toward me, crying. He has fallen in the indoor adventure playground. The room is enormous – an aircraft hangar of soft surfaces, spongy balls, trampolines and slides. It would, you’d think, be a challenge to hurt yourself in this environment, but it’s a challenge my son has accepted. He is not alone. A steady torrent of children streams from the cushioned gate down the padded steps to run, bawling, into their parents’ arms. We lie to ourselves that this is a place of fun. It is not. It is a house of horrors, a speed-run through trauma that parents use to toughen their children up. The cruel trick of such places is that the price of their enjoyment is a secret lesson in suffering and resilience. A kiss on the elbow, or a brief hug, and they’re back in the game, sprinting off for another eight-minute chunk of activity until their next life-ending misfortune.</p><p>This juncture between heaven and hell is my son’s favourite place on earth, and the place he cries most often. He calls it the ‘champoline park’.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/29/hard-lessons-to-be-learned-at-the-soft-play-zone">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The actor on her latest role as Crossroads doyenne Noele Gordon, watching Woody Allen fire people, and the key to understanding Princess Margaret</p><p>Helena Bonham Carter thinks that, at 56, she is being offered some of the richest parts of her long, storied career. The British actor is talking about Netflix’s <em>The Crown</em>, in which she played Princess Margaret in seasons three and four, and the forthcoming <em>Nolly</em> on ITVX. This three-part drama is the creation of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/13/nolly-russell-t-davies-crossroads-drama-helena-bonham-carter">Russell T Davies</a> (<em>It’s a Sin</em>), and sees Bonham Carter take on the role of Noele Gordon (AKA Nolly), who played Meg Morton, the matriarch of the British soap opera <em>Crossroads</em>, until she was unceremoniously fired in 1981 after 17 years on the show. Bonham Carter lives in London with her partner, art historian Rye Dag Holmboe, and her two children.</p><p><strong>Are you going to tell us that you were a diehard </strong><em><strong>Crossroads</strong></em><strong> fan and admirer of Noele Gordon?<br /></strong>Oh no! If you’d asked me 18 months ago, I didn’t know a thing! Haha. Now I’ll go on <em>Mastermind</em>: Noele Gordon, special subject, ask me a question.

<p>When in Yorkshire, do what the Yorkshire folk do</p><p>I mentioned I was in York, eating Yorkshire pudding wraps, a few weeks ago. And after queueing for a very long time for ceramic ghosts from York’s Ghost Merchants (it was the best queue ever), I was frozen solid. Luckily, right along from the Ghost shop on the Shambles we fell upon the <strong>Hebden Tea Experience</strong> (strong recommend).</p><p>Faced with 1,200 types, or so it seemed, of tea I determined not to be intimidated and just settle for English breakfast. Instead I asked for its <a href="https://www.hebdentea.com/product/pear-ginger-chocolate/0/">Pear, Chocolate and Ginger</a>, (from £1.90 to buy from its shop next door, also mail order). And it very much <em>is</em> a tea experience. You have a draining board at your table and you fill the teapot with your chosen tea (you get about six cups worth and yes there is a toilet), brew, pour, drink, pour away excess, start again. The PCG tea was quite the most delicious I have ever had. Very chocolatey and it requires no milk or sugar. I aim to drink a lot of this.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/29/tea-and-chocolate-are-a-perfectly-sweet-match">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Raised in a Paris banlieue, the documentary-maker is now in the spotlight thanks to her Venice prize-winning first feature, based on the true story of a woman accused of killing her baby</p><p>“I have a voice that doesn’t carry very well,” says French film-maker Alice Diop, when I tell her I can’t quite hear what she’s saying. We meet in a cafe near her home in the working-class district of Montreuil, on the eastern edge of Paris. It is busy with lunch parties, and the combination of Diop’s French – she speaks fast and quietly – with the occasional crashes of crockery isn’t ideal for discussing the complex, challenging new film she has made.</p><p>Still, if Diop’s speech doesn’t carry acoustically, it’s a different matter with her artistic voice. After a significant career as a documentary-maker, Diop’s feature film debut, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/12/saint-omer-alice-diop-best-movies-2022">Saint Omer</a></em>, is resonating worldwide. It won two awards at the Venice film festival last year and was France’s entry for the best international feature at the Academy Awards, making Diop the first black woman ever to represent France in the Oscar race.

<p>Fofana’s bravura debut collection of short stories brings the lives of marginalised city folk to life</p><p>The apartment building provides an arresting riposte to the perception that urban living grows ever more atomised, not least in New York City.

Fofana draws his narrators from among the residents of its 300-plus homes, and while all may be black, their intensely vernacular voices testify to the rich multiplicity of their roots and backstories, their dreams and disappointments.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/29/stories-from-the-tenants-downstairs-by-sidik-fofana-review-bold-funny-and-gloriously-flawed-voices-of-new-york">Continue reading...</a>

<p>He promised an end to the degeneracy of the Johnson years, but the scandals keep coming and the prime minister seems too weak to deal with them</p><p>This week, Rishi Sunak will clock up – celebrate wouldn’t be the mot juste – his 100th<sup> </sup>day at Number 10.

## Bring your birthday cake to work – it’s a crumb of comfort

<p>Work is changing fast, but one sure way to hold on to the old ways is to offer round a slice of cake and a cup of tea</p><p>When I was younger the phrases around work were largely of the “You Don’t Have To Be Mad To Work Here” variety. Office humour is a hell of a drug. “SARCASM is one of the free services I offer” propped on a desk alongside a family of gonks and three cooling coffees. “When you EXCEL they always SPREADSHEET about you.” It was good stuff! It kept us going through the dark days of the mid-2000s, before the world as we know it emerged, with its sickness and crop tops, and endless milks. And before work became so complicated and so changeable we were required to create whole new phrases and grammar to try to explain it.</p><p>The latest is “quiet hiring” – when employers ask workers to shift their roles rather than employ new staff, which is the younger sibling of “quiet quitting” – doing the minimum your job requires. That’s another one, a phrase built to help us re-conceptualise the ways we’re forced to work, especially since the pandemic, which slowly wrung out the last possibilities of joy from work’s withered flannel. My colleagues and I are currently working from home, or “WFH” (along with the new phrases came a file of correct pronunciations, and this, I can tell you, is pronounced like a dog sneezing), which means this month we have missed two deskmates’ birthdays, and so, two cakes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/29/bring-your-birthday-cake-to-work-its-a-crumb-of-comfort">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Many species will thank you for turning the central heating down</p><p>It’s a time of year when plant shops seem to be flooded with many of my favourite old-school Victorian houseplants, which these days are thought of – paradoxically, thanks to the widespread adoption of central heating – as incredibly tricky to grow. As so many of these cool-climate species look incredibly exotic, we tend to assume that their decline soon after we get them home is down to our own failure to spoil them with the steamy jungle conditions we are convinced they must require.</p><p>I think it’s reassuring to know that the reality is usually the exact opposite. With the current energy crisis causing many of us to consider reducing how many rooms we heat, and the temperature across our homes generally being lowered to a level that’s decidedly chillier, some of these species could really start to come into their own.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/29/plants-that-thrive-in-colder-homes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Bad experiences from his playing days have shaped England head coach’s approach ahead of his first Six Nations</p><p>Careers day at Hutton Grammar School in 1995 and the kids are writing down the jobs they want when they leave. “I wrote: ‘I want to be a professional rugby player and I want to play for England’,” recalls Steve Borthwick. “I was expecting this incredibly disapproving reaction, like: ‘You’re not going to be a professional rugby player’ and to the careers advisor’s great credit, she looked at me and said: ‘You want to be a professional rugby player? Well, you’d better learn how to spell ‘professional’ then.’”</p><p>The memory makes him laugh. Listening to Borthwick talk you get the sense he still cannot believe how lucky he is to be involved in Test rugby. He describes himself as the little kid who used to sit right up next to the TV screen for Five Nations games, and remembers how the hairs on the back of his neck would stand up when the players sang the national anthems.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/29/dreams-and-regrets-fuel-steve-borthwicks-coaching-philosophy">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘I have sad thoughts every day. I try not to be overcome by them’: Michael Rosen on coping with the death of his son

<p>He is much loved for his daffy humour, but poet Michael Rosen’s new memoir, Getting Better, is an arrestingly honest account of devastating loss. He talks to Alex Moshakis about feeling sad, and why he’s no longer ‘carrying an elephant’</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/29/i-knew-my-son-had-gone-michael-rosen-on-the-moment-that-changed-his-life-extract">Read an extract from Getting Better</a></li></ul><p>So, this is my little den,” the poet Michael Rosen says, showing me into his north London office. The den brims. Books fill shelves. Boxes pile on other boxes. Knickknacks freckle a desk. “Where would you like to sit?” he goes on. I choose the only seat he isn’t about to occupy himself, something wooden and old and half-covered by a coat. Rosen describes it as a “captain’s armchair” and seems satisfied. “It was my dad’s,” he says. Then a mischievous grin appears, as though he knows what is about to happen. When I sit down, the chair groans under my weight, and I become scared to move in case it gives way. Rosen says, plainly, “It’s a bit <em>creaky</em>.”</p><p>Rosen is the author of 140 books of poetry and prose, and is our former Children’s Laureate. He is tall and lanky; when he sits down at his desk it is like watching a long piece of paper fold itself into creases. It’s more than two years since he left hospital after a near-lethal battle with Covid. And though while in hospital nurses shaved his jaw clean, now his beard has returned and so has his good humour, so that he more closely resembles the Rosen people know: scruffy, daffy, softly playful.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/29/getting-better-michael-rosen-on-coping-with-the-death-of-his-teenage-son">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Michelle Williams and Paul Dano are spot on as the budding film-maker’s parents, yet the director’s childhood memoir plays to the awards gallery rather than to his fans</p><p>Just as every pop music sensation must at some point treat their audiences to a song portentously titled Time (Pink Floyd, David Bowie, the Alan Parsons Project, Tom Waits, Culture Club et al), so film-makers inevitably wind up courting awards with thinly disguised autobiographical movies about how they first fell in love with cinema. In little over a year we’ve had Kenneth Branagh’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/22/belfast-review-kenneth-branagh-jamie-dornan-judi-dench-ciaran-hinds-feelgood-memoir">Belfast</a></em>, which includes a trip to the flicks with the family to see <em>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</em>, and Sam Mendes’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/08/empire-of-light-review-sam-mendes-olivia-colman-sprawling-love-letter-to-cinema">Empire of Light</a></em>, a reminiscence inspired by his mother interspersed with touching projectionist elegies about movies creating the “illusion of motion, illusion of life”.</p><p>Into this overcrowded field comes <em>The Fabelmans</em>, in which versatile screenwriter and playwright <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/16/there-are-truths-that-have-to-be-told-and-they-may-upset-people-tony-kushner-on-spielberg-ye-and-the-orange-covered-mud-devil">Tony Kushner</a> takes the most well-rehearsed stories of Steven Spielberg’s childhood (anxiety about his parents splitting up; uncertainty about his cultural identity; redemption through the discovery of motion pictures) and deftly repackages them as fictionalised movie-magic fables. The result, which opened to soft box-office in the US in November, is a delightfully personal whimsy that has dazzled awards voters there. It has already won several prizes, and is up for seven Oscars, including best picture, although it hasn’t whipped up equal enthusiasm among the very audiences who made Spielberg one of the world’s most successful film-makers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/29/the-fabelmans-review-steven-spielberg-michelle-williams-paul-dano-lavishly-personal-love-letter-to-cinema">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From Kaia Gerber to Lily-Rose Depp, celebrity offspring are making a mockery of meritocracy</p><p>Why are we so <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/dec/22/nepo-babies-what-are-they-and-why-is-gen-z-only-just-discovering-them">outraged by nepo babies</a>? This is a question of particular interest to nepotism babies themselves who, since a <a href="https://nymag.com/press/2022/12/extremely-overanalyzing-hollywoods-nepo-baby-boom.html">recent </a><em><a href="https://nymag.com/press/2022/12/extremely-overanalyzing-hollywoods-nepo-baby-boom.html">New York </a></em><a href="https://nymag.com/press/2022/12/extremely-overanalyzing-hollywoods-nepo-baby-boom.html">magazine</a><strong><a href="https://nymag.com/press/2022/12/extremely-overanalyzing-hollywoods-nepo-baby-boom.html"> </a></strong><a href="https://nymag.com/press/2022/12/extremely-overanalyzing-hollywoods-nepo-baby-boom.html">article</a> on the children given a leg-up by their famous parents, have been attracting a level of opprobrium they are finding both unnecessary and unfair. After all, they say<strong>,</strong> they might get a foot in the door, but then they have to work twice as hard and be twice as good or at least prove themselves equal to the task. Kaia Gerber, the model daughter of Cindy Crawford, was last week the <a href="https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/kaia-gerber-talks-nepotism-hollywood">latest to make a variation on this point</a>, which has been repeated so many times by nepo babies down the decades that it has become a sort of proverb.</p><p>Let’s first take issue with this maxim. It’s just not true. The sons and daughters of the famous are helped all the way along. The forces that propel them into their first job – members of the industry wanting to please their parents – are still present at the second and the third. No one sacks or under-promotes the child of someone very important if it can possibly be helped: why risk torpedoing your own career? Instead, thresholds are lowered, sometimes literally (Lily-Rose Depp, daughter of Johnny, is just 5ft 3in but a stupendously successful model). And far from having to work extra hard to prove themselves, nepo babies have the scope to fail upwards, repeatedly. Björk’s daughter, Ísadóra, had her big break at 17 with the film <em>The Northman</em>, which flopped. Yet she signed a major modelling contract just two months later. Give a nepo baby a second or third chance and earn even more gratitude from those influential parents.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/29/nepo-babies-claim-their-parentage-is-overblown-truth-is-theyre-helped-all-the-way">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The author’s new novel – a retelling of a fictitious Sanskrit verse saga – employs a kind of autopilot postmodernism, and lacks the verbal gusto of his early works</p><p>The shock of Salman Rushdie’s horrific onstage maiming last August made it hard not to feel that we had somehow let our guard drop. After all, hadn’t the world’s most famous living writer long been a figure of fun? We scoffed at his thin-skinned tweets bizarrely comparing a female <em>New York Times</em> critic to Shakespeare’s Iago after she panned one of his novels; we giggled when a model leaked his out-of-the-blue message (“you look so gorgeous and hottt!”) and called him a “horny jerk”. By the time Rushdie made a cameo on <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em> to explain the pleasures of “fatwa sex”, did any viewer truly keep in mind the continuing threat to his life?</p><p>And either way, if he was enjoying himself, who could begrudge him? Rushdie’s memoir <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/joseph-anton-9780099563440">Joseph Anton</a></em> recalls how, after Ayatollah Khomeini called for his murder in 1989, he came under pressure to apologise for <em>The Satanic Verses</em> (1988) for the sake of British hostages in Beirut. A novelist! Seldom since has his work ever been allowed to stand free from the outsize freight loaded on to it by foes and well-wishers alike, and no doubt extravagant praise awaits his new book, <em>Victory City</em>, simply because it’s his first since last summer’s assault.<br /></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/29/victory-city-by-salman-rushdie-review-a-knotty-chronicle-of-intra-dynastic-rivalry">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Neonicotinoids kill bees and destroy the environment. A truly green government would find a better solution to the problem of aphid-borne disease</p><p>Near the end of 2022, the secretary of state for the environment, Thérèse Coffey, committed the UK to halving the impact of damaging pesticides on the nation’s wildlife and flora by the year 2030. It is a laudable aspiration. Biodiversity in Britain, as across the planet, is in peril as the climate heats up, pollution causes increasing harm to the landscape and alien species spread over the countryside. Considerable care will be needed if we are to protect nature, which is vital to our health, wellbeing and survival, from continued degradation. Limiting the ecological injury of pesticides is an encouraging move.</p><p>Unfortunately, Coffey’s words have not been matched by action. Incredibly, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has decided to waive restrictions on the use of a class of highly dangerous powerful toxins and permit their release on crops. Neonicotinoids have been described as the Novichok of bees: a single teaspoon is sufficient to kill more than a billion, say scientists.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/29/the-observer-view-on-the-uks-toxic-stance-on-sugar-farming">Continue reading...</a>

I read with interest as this is exactly how mine was issued, here in Ireland in 2022.</p><p>I remember arriving at the notary with my family and the solemnity of signing that declaration – that I am a woman. I remember weeping when it arrived, tears of relief, that there I was, a female, recognised by the state. It made me proud that my country, for all its faults, treated me with a dignity that many would say I didn’t deserve. That certificate allowed me to live without the need to constantly explain and out myself. It meant I could interview for a job, get an apartment, travel internationally and live without risking exclusion, discrimination or my safety. Had I waited for “a diagnosis”, I would be at the mercy of a three-year wait list – not unlike the UK. Being transgender is not a pathology and should not be treated as such.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2023/jan/29/declaring-my-own-gender-made-me-the-woman-i-am-today">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Imagine what it’s like for her living with someone she sees as an intruder – then try to put her feelings into words</p><p><em><strong>The dilemma </strong>I am really struggling with my partner’s daughter. My partner and his ex separated several years ago, when his two children were just four and six. They went through an acrimonious split and he eventually won full custody of the children. I moved in recently and have been in their lives for about six months now. At the beginning, his daughter was affectionate; however her attitude has changed towards me. I think she also believes if she rejects me enough, then I will leave and she will have her dad to herself. I really try to keep the trauma of the break-up she has been through in mind every day, but it’s getting harder to accept her mean behaviour. She ignores my existence, making no eye contact, not answering any questions until she’s made to and even then when she does it’s monosyllabic.</em></p><p><em>When my partner has spoken to her about it, she becomes aggressively upset, demanding to know exactly when and where these things have occurred so that she can blame me. I am walking on eggshells in the house all day. I have tried ignoring the behaviour, but I really find it too upsetting. The more I ignore it, the more I am separated from the family “group” and become an unwelcome outsider.</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/29/ask-philippa-perry-i-cant-stop-my-partners-daughter-being-rude-to-me">Continue reading...</a>

## Make new friends with old-vine wines

<p>For a full-bodied wintry red, look no further than old-vine carignan.</p><p><strong>Alain Grignon Carignan Vieilles Vignes, IGP Pays de l’Herault, France 2021 (£8.99, or £6.99 as part of a mixed case of six bottles, <a href="http://majestic.co.uk/">majestic.co.uk</a>) </strong>Old vines have become something of a cause célèbre in the wine business in recent years. In part, it’s a conservation issue: older plants, some of which are about 100 years old or more, represent an important part of wine’s heritage. They’re also more efficient when it comes to water, or rather, its absence (increasingly useful as the climate crisis brings more frequent and severe droughts to many parts of the wine world). Happily, in many cases there’s a quality angle, too: more often than not, old vines deliver more concentrated but better-balanced fruit than younger vines, albeit in much smaller quantities. What’s more, rather curiously, age seems to have a positive effect on even the most unfashionable grape varieties. Old-vine versions of carignan, for example, such as the vividly blackberry juicy version from Alain Grignon, show a completely different side to this often-derided Mediterranean red grape.</p><p><strong>Viña Bisquertt Crazy Rows Carignan, Maule Valley, Chile 2020 (£7.90, <a href="http://revl.co.uk/">revl.co.uk</a>) </strong>Carignan was the most widely planted grape variety in France up until the end of the 20th century, although its popularity in the Midi had more to do with fecundity (it was capable of enormous yields in the southern sun) than quality (high-yielding young vines tended to bring wines with fearsome tannins and acidity and very little in the way of fruit flavour). Recent years have seen a lot of carignan uprooted in the Languedoc-Roussillon, while at the same time growers have learned to treasure the oldest vines (in the case of Alain Grignon, that’s 50 to 100 years old). Something very similar has happened in Chile’s Maule Valley, and today old-vine carignan is responsible for some of the country’s most deliciously individualistic wines, such as muscular succulence and squirt of fresh black fruit and liquorice in Viña Bisquertt’s Crazy Rows, the herby-earthy quality and berries of Viña Morande Adventure Vigno Carignan 2019 (£18.79, <a href="http://allaboutwine.co.uk/">allaboutwine.co.uk</a>); and the chunky intensity of Torres Vigno Carignan 2016 (£13.99, <a href="https://www.waitrose.com/">Waitrose</a>).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/29/make-new-friends-with-old-vine-wines">Continue reading...</a>

Ingredients would beg to be taken to a place of safety when he approached. Vegetables would audibly start praying. I don’t think it was a lack of ability. He simply wasn’t interested. If he was left to feed us kids, his default dish – I use the term loosely – was worsht and eggs: a bouncy, dry, draught excluder of an omelette alongside slices of a blunt, salty kosher beef salami, dyed a worrying shade of red, which stained everything it touched pink including, I imagine, the lower intestine. It was the taste of parental abandonment, at least where dinner time was concerned.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/29/supawan-thai-london-takes-your-mouth-on-the-ride-of-its-life-restaurant-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>EU president says Ukraine has unconditional support ahead of summit; Russian strike kills three people in a residential district of eastern Ukraine </p><p>The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said ahead of an EU-Ukraine summit next week that<strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> had unconditional support from the bloc and needed to prevail against Russian attacks to defend European values.</strong> “We stand by Ukraine’s side without any ifs and buts. Ukraine is fighting for our shared values, it is fighting for the respect of international law and for the principles of democracy and that is why Ukraine has to win this war.”</p><p><strong>A Russian strike killed three people in a residential district of the eastern Ukrainian city of Kostiantynivka on Saturday, the regional governor said.</strong> Fourteen other people were wounded in the attack, which also damaged four apartment buildings and a hotel. According to Ukraine’s defence ministry, Russia carried out attacks on Konstantynivka with multiple rocket launchers.</p><p><strong>Russia accused the Ukrainian military of deliberately striking a hospital</strong> in a Russian-held area of eastern Ukraine on Saturday. It said a strike killed 14 people and wounded 24 patients and medical staff. The strike hit a hospital in the Russian-held settlement of Novoaidar and was carried out using a US-supplied Himars rocket launch system, the Russian defence ministry said. The claims could not be independently verified, AP reported.</p><p><strong>Kyiv and its western allies are engaged in “fast-track” talks on the possibility of equipping Ukraine with long-range missiles and military aircraft</strong>, a top aide to Ukraine’s president says, AP reported. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Ukraine’s supporters in the west “understand how the war is developing” and the need to supply planes capable of providing cover for the armoured fighting vehicles that the United States and Germany have pledged.</p><p><strong>Ukraine said on Friday it would take its pilots about half a year to train for combat in western fighter jets</strong> such as US F-16s, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/26/ukraine-says-us-and-german-tank-pledges-only-the-beginning-and-calls-for-fighter-jets">as Kyiv steps up its campaign to secure fourth-generation warplanes</a>. Ukraine got a huge boost this week when Germany and the United States announced plans to provide heavy tanks to Kyiv, which is now hoping the west will also provide long-range missiles and fighter jets.</p><p><strong>North Korea on Saturday denounced US pledges of battle tanks</strong>, claiming Washington was “further crossing the red line” to win hegemony by proxy war, Reuters quoted state media KCNA reporting. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s sister, Kim Yo-jong, made the remarks in a statement, saying that North Korea will “stand in the same trench” as Russia against the United States.</p><p><strong>Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, will hold a meeting with Lynne Tracy,</strong> the new US ambassador to Moscow, early next week, the RIA news agency reported.</p><p><strong>Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Saturday redoubled his efforts to stop Russian athletes participating the 2024 Olympics</strong>, saying they would try to justify the war against Ukraine if allowed to compete. Zelenskiy said on Friday that Ukraine would launch an international campaign to keep Russia out of the summer games, which will be held in Paris. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said on Friday that any attempt to squeeze Moscow out of international sport because of what it calls its special military operation in Ukraine was “doomed to fail”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/29/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-340-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>
