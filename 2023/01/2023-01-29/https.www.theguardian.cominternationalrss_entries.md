<p>Novak Djokovic touched his finger to his temple after winning the Australian Open from within his own vacuum</p><p>Stefanos Tsitsipas has always had a Novak Djokovic problem. It was a lost-the-last-nine-matches type of problem – not the archetypal self-affirmation statistic for his bathroom mirror. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/29/australian-open-tennis-novak-djokovic-stefanos-tsitsipas-final-report">Now it is 10 and he is no less of a competitor for it</a>, merely the latest victim of a champion who, in Tsitsipas’s own post-match words, is “the greatest that has ever held a tennis racket”.</p><p>At least he is not alone. A lot of people have a Djokovic problem, and the list is not limited to other players (though 22 grand slam singles titles means there are many of those). The public, the media, even Ukraine’s ambassador to Australia have all spent the past two weeks examining the Serb with a level of suspicion reserved for one of sport’s most divisive figures.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jan/29/novak-djokovic-stefanos-tsitsipas-australian-open-final">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When the UK singer returned after a 12-year career hiatus with a song about motherhood and death, it cracked the Savage Garden singer wide open – and gave him a roadmap for his own life</p><p>Wuthering Heights terrified me as a child.

But I knew, being a huge Kate Bush fan, that there were two major personal life events that had happened to her: she’d chosen to become a mum and she’d lost her own mother.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/30/darren-hayes-a-coral-room-by-kate-bush-is-the-most-perfect-song-of-all-time">Continue reading...</a>

But she’s not the only one.</p><p>If you take a 20-minute drive along South Van Ness Avenue, you can stop for a mint mojito coffee at Philz in Russian Hill, hit the Ike’s Sandwiches eight minutes away in Cathedral Hill for a Super Mario meatball sandwich and then pop into Bi-Rite Market in the Mission for some olive oil and salted caramel ice cream.

<p>Hungarian photographer Andi Gáldi Vinkó’s playful portrait of her child, part of series on becoming a parent, combines humour and intimacy</p><p>To say the subject of <a href="https://andigv.com/">Andi Gáldi Vinkó</a>’s book is a diary of motherhood doesn’t get anywhere near to the fleshy, playful vulnerability of her pictures. Titled <em>Sorry I </em><em>Gave </em><em>Birth I </em><em>Disappeared </em><em>But </em><em>Now I’m </em><em>Back</em>, the Hungarian photographer’s journal is a kind of traveller’s tale from the magical and estranging foreign land of childbirth. “When I realised I was pregnant,” she writes, by way of introduction, “I had no idea what awaited me. How messy and how raw, how unpredictable and how out of control motherhood really was compared to the images I had in my mind from films, photos, paintings done by men.”</p><p>Her images take you deep into that out-of-control place, her body no longer all her own, colonised by other dramatic forces. Her camera watches it all swell, as she pictures befores and afters: “Then I was an emerging artist, travelling around and going to art fairs and exhibitions and openings. Now I am a mother of two working on borrowed time hoping the years I’ve lost to mothering can be written into my CV without guilt and shame.”</p><p><em>Sorry I </em><em>Gave </em><em>Birth I </em><em>Disappeared </em><em>But </em><em>Now I’m </em><em>Back </em>by Andi Gáldi Vinkó is <a href="https://trolleybooks.com/products/sorry-i-gave-birth-i-disappeared-but-now-im-back-by-andi-galdi-vinko">published by Trolley Books (£40)</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jan/29/the-big-picture-the-messy-and-magical-reality-of-motherhood">Continue reading...</a>
