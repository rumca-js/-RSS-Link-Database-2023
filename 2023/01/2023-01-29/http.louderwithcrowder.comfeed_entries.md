For starters, he <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bill-maher-kid-rock" target="_blank">condemned</a> "child-friendly" drag shows, which unfortunately is considered a conservative take in our upside-down world. He also <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bill-maher-slams-body-positivity" target="_blank">slammed</a> "body positivity," and the "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bill-maher-misinformation-board" target="_blank">disinformation governance board,</a>" and even <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bill-maher-roe-wade" target="_blank">admitted</a> that America has very liberal abortion laws compared to European countries. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cThis week Bill Maher learned European countries have far more restrictive abortion laws than we do in America and that women report being pro-life more often than men. How many people have no clue about this or about fetal pain science? If they did, some might change.\u201d</div> — Robby Starbuck (@Robby Starbuck)

<p>Maher will soon be in hot water with the left again. On an upcoming episode of his "<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/club-random-with-bill-maher/id1613459129" target="_blank">Club Random</a>" podcast, Maher shared some opinions on slavery with actor Bryan Cranston that the lefties won't be happy to hear. </p><p>Maher said, <em>"I’ve talked about it on my show, I mean, slavery, for the people who are wanting to cancel Thomas Jefferson and George Washington because they had slaves, and everybody else, in an era when everyone had slaves who could afford it, including people of color in other parts of the world.”</em></p><p>He went on to explain, <em>"It was a human thing, it’s not just a white thing. O</em><em>kay, so if you’re going to cancel Jefferson and Washington, you have to cancel Jesus, because he never spoke against it, it’s not in the Old Testament, there’s a million rules about slavery, none of them are ‘don’t do it.'”</em></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>There are a few issues with his Biblical argument. Biblical slavery commonly refers to indentured servitude that the poor or indebted would temporarily utilize, rather than modern chattel slavery. Even slaves that sold themselves into chattel slavery often did so out of necessity, as opposed to the modern-era practice of kidnapping and forced selling of human beings. The Bible expressly condemns the kidnapping and selling of slaves in Exodus 21:16 as punishable by death. And regulation of the practice does not equal endorsement. </p><p>But, then again, it's no surprise that Bill Maher hates religion. Biblical errors aside, he's making some fair points on the history of slavery. And the woke left is not going to like it one bit. </p><p><p>

## Watch: Pastor claims he went to hell and Satan was totally bumpin' that Rihanna joint

Johnson explained<em>, "I thought I was having a heart attack, and my spirit left my physical body. And I thought that I was going upward cause I thought I had done so much good in this lifetime and helped so many people and made so many decisions that were Godly decisions but as opposed to me going up, I went down and I went literally into the center of the Earth, that's where Hell is, Jesus even said that in Scriptures." </em></p><p><em><br /></em></p><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@geraldajohnson1/video/7174925291230334250" class="tiktok-embed">
<section>
<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@geraldajohnson1" target="_blank" title="@geraldajohnson1">@geraldajohnson1</a>
<p>My experience when I saw hell in February 2016. I’ll never be the same after that. #hell #jesus #unforgiveness #forgive #godsaid #encouragement #geraldajohnson #jesuslovesyou #moveforward</p>
</section>
</blockquote>
<p><br /></p><p>He went on to explain some of what he saw: <em>"There was a man on all fours like a dog. He was burned from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet and his eyes were bulging out, and what was worse than that was he had a chain around his neck, so he was like a dog in Hell. And what was even worse than that was who was holding the chain. It was a demon holding the chain." </em></p><p>That sounds pretty terrifying. But then, Pastor Johnson got to the worst part: in Hell, the demons were <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ilhan-omar-cant-praise-allah" target="_blank">singing</a> Rihanna. </p><p><em>"In Hell, there was a section where music was playing. And it was the same music that we hear on the Earth, but as opposed to entertainers singing it, demons were singing it. and it was some of the same lyrics that we hear here [...] So here, music is for like if you get over a breakup, 'Don't Worry, Be Happy,' 'I bust the windows out your car,' 'under my umbre-hella,' whatever. There, every lyric to every song is to torment you as to the fact that you didn't worship God through music when you were on the Earth." </em></p><p>Rihanna can be terrifying as is. But Rihanna sung by a <em>demon</em>? Aw hell nah. Pun intended. </p><p><p>

## 'That's the goal': Public school teacher brags about confusing little kids about their gender

You know, like how it's inappropriate to indoctrinate children under the age of ten on sex and gender. Not only did the teachers' union poll <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/stephen-a-smith-gop-presidential" target="_blank">NOT turn out in opposition to DeSantis</a>, but it showed "voters approve of DeSantis’ education policy positions and even some of his rhetoric."</p><p>I think of that when I see videos like this specimen. It's an alleged kindergarten teacher bragging about how she confuses your five-year-old. You see, there are people in America who hold the political belief you can choose whether you are a boy or a girl. This teacher not only believes it, but she (or maybe he) also pushes those political beliefs on your kids.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">This teacher <a href="https://twitter.com/VHelementary?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@VHelementary</a> brags about her goal of confusing children. <a href="https://t.co/xoidH13OQf">pic.twitter.com/xoidH13OQf</a><br />— 👁️ Inside The Classroom | Anti-Trans Cult (@EITC_Official) <a href="https://twitter.com/EITC_Official/status/1617600955180277761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 23, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>One of my coworkers told me that they were talking to some students in the hallway, and they asked if I'm a boy or a girl. The teacher was like, "does it matter? She's cool." And they were like, "no, I just can't figure it out. It's so hard, I can't figure it out!" That's the goal! That's the goal!</blockquote><p>Videos like this take me back to High School. Picture it: 1992. Kris Kross ruled the airwaves. A young Roseanne Barr made us laugh. And a naive Brodigan innocently asked his US History teacher who she liked in the 1992 Democrat Primary. I still recall look of awkwardness on her face because it was inappropriate to discuss personal political views with students. Even when asked a simple question about current events.</p><p>1992 is a bygone era. As is 2021, where teachers at least had the sense not to advertise their indoctrination on social media. Now it's 2023 and teachers believe it's their right to exploit your five-year-old by pushing their political agenda on them instead of teaching things like sight words. The teachers and their allies act as if they're NOT the ones who are assholes in this situation. You're the asshole for thinking this is inappropriate for kindergarten students.</p><p> These same teachers, along with the union thugs who control them and the democrats those unions give millions of dollars to, then wonder why a diverse coalition of parents support leaders who are willing to stand up and fight back.</p><p><p>

A community center hosted a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/parade-charlotte-pole" target="_blank">family-friendly</a> "Beauty and the Bingo" event. Grown adults bring their children to play Bingo. And in between, grown men who dress like women give sexualized performances and reference having people put their mouths on their genitalia. Did I mention this event was <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/florida-family-friendly" target="_blank">family-friendly</a>? That's a key point to make.</p><p>Citizen journalist Sara Gonzales went undercover but was thrown out when the event planning committee noticed someone who looked like they have morals and decency was sitting there with her smartphone out. </p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">🚨 PRINCETON, TX: Bearded drag queen toasts to “those who lick us where we pee” in front of young children, who later run up to COLLECT TIP MONEY for another drag queen. 🚨<br /><br />They kicked me out of the event, but strangely streamed the whole thing on Facebook. <a href="https://t.co/pMPAovsR2a">pic.twitter.com/pMPAovsR2a</a><br />— Sara Gonzales (@SaraGonzalesTX) <a href="https://twitter.com/SaraGonzalesTX/status/1619507742926077952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 29, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>In the drag queen's defense, they are an adult performer. They could have not thought anyone in their right mind would bring little kids to a raunchy performance such as this. Unfortunately, not all parents have the most sense and will put THEIR needs in front of their kids' needs. If they want to go to the drag show but they can't find a babysitter, they'll drag the kids to the drag show. Heaven forbid the parents have to sacrifice what they want ever.</p><p> I'm sure the drag queen assumed there were no children in the audience before toasting those who give him oral sex...</p><blockquote>I know there's little babies here but, close your ears, this is just a tradition that all shows normally do.</blockquote><p>You sick f*ck.</p><p>Then when another sexually dressed man did a flip and money fell out of their undergarments, some of the little children in attendance got down on their hands and knees to pick it up while the audience celebrated.</p><blockquote>And thank you to our little helpers running up here picking up her money. That right there is our future guys.</blockquote><p>Progressives have determined that bringing your children to drag shows is the only effective way to showcase how tolerant and inclusive they are. There have always been drag shows. Adult men would dress up like women, give themselves a double entendre for a name, tell some raunchy jokes and entertain ADULTS in bars. If that's your thing, fine.</p><p>Then minors would <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mashable-ten-year-old-drag-queen" target="_self">dress up like women and entertain adults in bars</a>. Conservatives said, "hey, this seems inappropriate."</p><p>The left doubled down with "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mashable-ten-year-old-drag-queen" target="_self">Drag Queen Story Time</a>." Conservatives said, "guys, let's leave children alone because this is wrong."</p><p>Now, little children find themselves asking their parents "daddy, why would I lick someone where they pee?" And all the adults involved think that's cool.</p><p>Now<p>

## Zachary Levi said something mean about the left's favorite Big Pharma company and they are freaking out
