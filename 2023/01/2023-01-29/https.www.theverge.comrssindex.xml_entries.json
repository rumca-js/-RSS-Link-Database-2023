Movie </em>teaser lets us hear Seth Rogen as Donkey Kong for the first time. During the clip, Mario faces off against Donkey Kong in an arena of sorts \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/29/23484511/super-mario-bros-movie-trailer-princess-peach\">just like we\u2019ve seen in the previous trailer</a> \u2014 but this trailer expands on the scene. </p>\n<p id=\"7fRdqg\">While it seems like Mario\u2019s on the losing side of the battle, this appears to change when the titular plumber hits a question mark block, and (presumably) gets the Super Bell, transforming him into Cat Mario.
