You can elucidate me, but either way I&rsquo;ll be in the region.\nIf you guys start shooting each other, either way, that leg of the journey will be canceled so play nice until after this summer! \ud83d\ude09</p>\n<p>I do know some people who live in or frequent the region.\nNow is your time to <a href=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/contact\">contact me</a> if you&rsquo;ll be there then.\nPeople I don&rsquo;t know are welcome to contact me if they want to arrange a small public meet-up, which I am theoretically open to.\nI will be with other people in a group though, so don&rsquo;t expect to separate me from my group for too long.\nI&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;d come along if you&rsquo;re not creeps.</p>\n<p>I have a short list of Orthodox Churches and monastaries I intend to visit\n(although this is not a pilgrimage, and the people I&rsquo;ll be with are not Orthodox),\nand also some other attractions.\nSuggestions of places to go, whether natural or man-made, religious are secular are welcome.\nHints for good and cheap living in the region are invited as well, since I&rsquo;ll again be with several people and I want to economize for everyone since we may be around several weeks.\nI think for a good portion of the time, we&rsquo;ll just be hanging out in the area.</p>\n<p>Contact me quick though, because we&rsquo;re about to start buying tickets and making concrete plans and such.</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}], "source": {"url": "https://lukesmith.xyz/rss.xml", "title": "Luke Smith"}}
