  <p id="xW3JpT">The latest <em>Super Mario Bros. Movie </em>teaser lets us hear Seth Rogen as Donkey Kong for the first time. During the clip, Mario faces off against Donkey Kong in an arena of sorts — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/29/23484511/super-mario-bros-movie-trailer-princess-peach">just like we’ve seen in the previous trailer</a> — but this trailer expands on the scene. </p>
<p id="7fRdqg">While it seems like Mario’s on the losing side of the battle, this appears to change when the titular plumber hits a question mark block, and (presumably) gets the Super Bell, transforming him into Cat Mario. Seeing Mario in his adorably fuzzy catsuit sends Donkey Kong into a laughing fit, which gives us a chance to hear <a href="https://youtu.be/nc02X67hHOQ">Rogen’s signature laugh</a>.</p>

  <p id="TaYCf3">San Francisco transportation officials want Waymo and Cruise to slow the expansion of their robotaxi services in the city due to safety concerns, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/san-francisco-looks-hit-brakes-self-driving-cars-rcna66204">as reported earlier by NBC News</a>.

<p id="0Rwa2i">The GM-backed Cruise and Alphabet-owned Waymo are currently the only companies permitted to offer driverless rides to passengers in San Francisco.

  <p id="pEyBUA">Microsoft, GitHub, and OpenAI want the court to dismiss a proposed class action complaint that accuses the companies of scraping licensed code to build GitHub’s AI-powered Copilot tool, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/openai-microsoft-want-court-toss-lawsuit-accusing-them-abusing-open-source-code-2023-01-27/">as reported earlier by <em>Reuters</em></a>.
