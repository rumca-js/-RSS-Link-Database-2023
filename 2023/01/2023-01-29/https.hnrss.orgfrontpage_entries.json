I am not sure this is what I want for the rest of my life.<p>I love the sec field. In the last few years I've played lots of CTFs, pwned several boxes on Hack the Box, studied and reproduced CVEs, etc. I have the technical knowledge.<p>I don't think that I want to do pentests or bug bounty. I'm more into research. I like to be the one ahead discovering new stuff. But, how do I get there? Who hires someone like that? What do you need to get the role? How is this job for real? So many questions.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34572912\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34572912</a></p>\n<p>Points: 14</p>\n<p># Comments:

the areas where much of the civilian infrastructure was destroyed and Starlink\u00ae is not a viable option, or perhaps \"not-to-be easily scaled option.\"<p>The world of long-range Wi-Fi is a wild one!<p>We are now trying to evaluate the cost of a point-to-point mesh network using commodity hardware, and so far have only experimented with Raspberry hardware to work the antenna, and some Atheros AR9331-based SoC's. The idea is to make a single device that can act as both a relay station, as well as an actual hotspot, it then can be placed in line-of-sight configuration to potentially cover huge areas (the accepted performance would be anywhere from 0.1-1 Mbit/s point-to-point over anywhere from 5-20km. We are aiming to bring the cost of such configuration down to $100 per unit at least. Hopefully, we also wouldn't need to do so and somebody else could do the whole thing for us at a similar price... Where would you start, i.e. with the vendors, as well as the commodity hardware, firmware that should work best for a setup like this? Bonus points; if it can be somewhat be aware of the current happenstance.

In theory 5G should offer a lot more bandwidth, but I don't remember ever being bandwidth-limited on LTE. 20Mbps is plenty on my phone. Same for latency. I'm not playing FPS games on my phone.<p>5G seems worse, but I used to work on a physical layer wireless technology and it might be placebo knowing that the higher frequencies used for 5G don't go as far or penetrate as effectively.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34564590\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34564590</a></p>\n<p>Points: 83</p>\n<p># Comments: 102</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://eden.bearblog.dev/unconditional-love/", "title": "Unconditional Love", "date_published": "2023-01-29 02:57:02+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://eden.bearblog.dev/unconditional-love/\">https://eden.bearblog.dev/unconditional-love/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34564404\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34564404</a></p>\n<p>Points: 18</p>\n<p># Comments: 26</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/158915/331615", "title": "Can an electric circuit do recursion?", "date_published": "2023-01-29 02:30:05+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/158915/331615\">https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/158915/331615</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34564279\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34564279</a></p>\n<p>Points: 25</p>\n<p># Comments: 10</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/reverse-rss-feed", "title": "Reverse RSS Feed", "date_published": "2023-01-29 01:09:52+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/reverse-rss-feed\">https://www.jefftk.com/p/reverse-rss-feed</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34563853\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34563853</a></p>\n<p>Points: 23</p>\n<p># Comments: 3</p>", "persistent": true, "language": "en-US", "user": "rumpel"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://github.com/jmforsythe/Git-Heat-Map", "title": "Show HN: Git Heat Map \u2013 a tool for visualising git repo activity for each file", "date_published": "2023-01-29 01:09:35+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://github.com/jmforsythe/Git-Heat-Map\">https://github.com/jmforsythe/Git-Heat-Map</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34563851\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34563851</a></p>\n<p>Points: 72</p>\n<p># Comments: 13</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34563353", "title": "Ask HN: What is the best source to learn Docker in 2023?", "date_published": "2023-01-29 00:05:52+00:00", "description": "<p>I know docker for a long time but I never used it in serious projects.
