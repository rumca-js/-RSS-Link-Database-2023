## Google is making free anti-terrorism moderation tools for smaller websites

<p>Meta isn't the only tech heavyweight making tools to help <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-open-source-tool-scan-terrorist-content-130952284.html">root out terrorist content</a>. The <em>Financial Times</em> has <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c2da6eb1-ba81-40c5-a411-dfc94ea280db">learned</a> Google's Jigsaw is developing a free tool to help smaller websites detect and remove extremist material. The project, built with the help of the UN-supported Tech Against Terrorism, makes it easier for moderator teams to deal with potentially illegal content. The effort has the assistance of the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (founded by Google, Meta, Microsoft and Twitter), which offers a cross-service database of terrorist items. Two unnamed sites will test the code later this year.</p><p>As with Meta's open source utility, Google's tool is meant to assist sites that can't afford to develop AI detection algorithms or hire a large moderation staff. That may be critical when the European Union's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/european-union-digital-markets-services-acts-131818075.html">Digital Services Act</a> and the UK's looming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/deepfake-porn-uk-ban-online-safety-bill-171007700.html">Online Safety bill</a> will both require that site operators pull extremist content to avoid penalties.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Both Google and Tech Against Terrorism see their project as necessary to close a gap in countering online terrorist activity. Extremists and misinformation peddlers kicked off mainstream platforms frequently turn to smaller outlets that can't always adequately police users. Ideally, this reduces the chances of terrorists finding safe havens.</p><p>There are limitations. Some social platforms have been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/parler-app-return-to-android-play-store-191902824.html">reluctant to moderate content</a> even when app store operators say it incites violence — Google's tool won't be very useful on websites that don't want it. It also won't stop terrorists from sharing material over well-encrypted messaging services or the Dark Web, where providers can't easily snoop on data traffic. This might, however, make it harder to jump to online alternatives.</p>

## Y-Brush's '10-second toothbrush' arrives in the US

<p>As someone who bought an electric toothbrush far too late in life, I appreciate any product that promises to save me from expensive dental care. After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/y-brush-2-concept-010037878.html">debuting a few years ago in Europe</a>, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-05-ybrush-10-second-electric-toothbrush-final.html">Y-Brush</a>, a sonic toothbrush that can clean your teeth in 10 seconds flat, is now available in the US <a href="https://a.co/d/hqpkwoY"><ins>through Amazon</ins></a>. Unlike a traditional toothbrush, the Y-Brush features a mouthguard-shaped head with 35,000 nylon bristles designed to clean all your teeth simultaneously. Rather than moving the brush around your mouth for two minutes, you position one side of your mouth inside the Y-Brush, turn on the device and then gently chew on the brush head while rotating it around your teeth. Once you’re done with one set of teeth, you repeat the process on the other half. At most, you can expect to spend 30 seconds brushing your teeth.</p><p>Y-Brush doesn’t promise better cleaning performance so much as claiming you’ll do a better job of taking care of your teeth with its products. Since most adults spend about 45 seconds to a minute brushing when they go clean their teeth, most traditional and electric toothbrushes aren’t as effective as they could be if people spent the two minutes they’re supposed to commit to maintaining their pearly whites. Most modern electric toothbrushes try to get around that problem by including timers designed to remind you to move the brush around your gumline and hit different parts. The Y-Brush instead attempts to make the process as fast as possible.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At $80 for the base NylonStart model, which doesn’t include a timer setting (you can count to 10, right?), the Y-Brush is more expensive than your average electric toothbrush. Popular models like <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9QaGlsaXBzLVNvbmljYXJlLVRvb3RoYnJ1c2gtUmVjaGFyZ2VhYmxlLUhYMzY4MS9kcC9CMDlMRDhUNDQ1L3JlZj1zcl8xXzFfc3NwYT9rZXl3b3Jkcz1waGlsaXBzK3NvbmljYXJlK3Rvb3RoYnJ1c2gmcWlkPTE2NzI3ODMxMDcmc3ByZWZpeD1QaGlsaXBzK3MlMkNhcHMlMkM5NyZzcj04LTEtc3BvbnMmcHNjPTEmc3BMYT1aVzVqY25sd2RHVmtVWFZoYkdsbWFXVnlQVUZDT1ZOYVVGSTJUME5PTjBJbVpXNWpjbmx3ZEdWa1NXUTlRVEF6TVRNd05EWXlTVkJFVGxJM1FsSTNTVU16Sm1WdVkzSjVjSFJsWkVGa1NXUTlRVEE0TnpVMU1ESkhSalZHUlZoRVIwczJNVVFtZDJsa1oyVjBUbUZ0WlQxemNGOWhkR1ltWVdOMGFXOXVQV05zYVdOclVtVmthWEpsWTNRbVpHOU9iM1JNYjJkRGJHbGphejEwY25WbCZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1lbC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjU0ZjBlODItMWFlZS00YzU0LWI0MGUtYTM3N2Y1NjQ5YjIyIn0&amp;signature=AQAAARlFXgs5_0i9xY9L4cn_umq4xdI3qOsmLshnHobJsOuk&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPhilips-Sonicare-Toothbrush-Rechargeable-HX3681%2Fdp%2FB09LD8T445%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1_sspa%3Fkeywords%3Dphilips%2Bsonicare%2Btoothbrush%26qid%3D1672783107%26sprefix%3DPhilips%2Bs%252Caps%252C97%26sr%3D8-1-spons%26psc%3D1%26spLa%3DZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFCOVNaUFI2T0NON0ImZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTAzMTMwNDYySVBETlI3QlI3SUMzJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA4NzU1MDJHRjVGRVhER0s2MUQmd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl"><ins>Sonicare 4100</ins></a> will set you back about $50 – though you’ll curse Philips for its pricey and proprietary brush heads. Y-Brush also offers a kids model suitable for children between the ages of four and 12, and a $130 NylonBlack variant that features multiple timer settings and ships with an accessory you can attach to your toothpaste tube to make it easier to use it with the Y-Brush.</p>

## Roland's first gaming product is the Bridge Cast streaming mixer

<p>Roland may be a mainstay in the electronic music world, but it also dabbles in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roland-aero-caster-vrc-01-wireless-streaming-setup-112113739.html">occasional</a> creator <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rolands-go-mixer-pro-x-studio-in-your-pocket-160021589.html">product</a>, too. This year at CES the company has unveiled an audio interface aimed squarely at streamers and it’s called the Bridge Cast ($299).</p><p>Like rival products such as the <a href="https://www.tc-helicon.com/product.html?modelCode=P0CQK">GoXLR</a> or Rode’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rodecaster-pro-ii-details-000035416.html">Rodcaster Pro II</a>, the Bridge Cast offers a way to pipe different audio feeds (chat, music, game audio, browser sounds and so on) to different destinations - usually your local mix and the one your audience hears.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As you’d expect, there’s an input for an XLR mic and options for dual/submixes along with a selection of vocal effects. There are four channels with rotary controls for mic, aux, chat and game. Each channel also gets a mute button for quickly removing unwanted audio without diving into settings. An intersting touch is the ability to customize the faceplate so if your channel, stream or team has a logo you could add some branding into your Twitch or YouTube feed.</p><p>Deeper control will apparently be available via the companion software to fine tune the mic sound or even the EQ of your game audio.</p><p>The streaming space has become a massive opportunity for legacy audio companies, and it’s good to see Roland furthering its commitment to this space. How it stacks up to its rivals though, remains to be seen, but if your new year’s resolution was to finally get that stream off the ground then it looks like you have one more option to consider.</p>

## The Seagull Pro cleans your pool with a quad-motor system

<p>Five-year-old pool cleaning company Aiper is launching the Seagull Pro, which the company says is the world’s first quad-motor pool-cleaning robot. The flagship vacuum is a CES 2023 Innovation Award Honoree.</p><p>The Seagull Pro’s quad-motor system moves the robot around your pool by sucking and quickly exhausting water. Aiper says it can “suck in dirt, sand, leaves, hairs and other particles on the pool’s floor more efficiently than other models.” It can clean in- or above-ground pools (up to 3,200 sq. ft.) for up to three hours per charge and offers three modes: floor cleaning, wall cleaning and auto, which cleans both. Aiper says the device’s WavePath Navigation follows “a unique wave shape” while cleaning to increase its coverage compared to vacuums that wander randomly. The Seagull Pro will cost $900 when it launches in March.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Product image of the Seagull Plus pool-cleaning robot" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/f8a3f0f0-8233-11ed-8dff-d81bf7529765" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Aiper</div></figure><p>Additionally, Aiper has new cheaper models, including the $400 Seagull Plus. It’s made for pools up to 1,300 sq. ft. and helps reduce its cost by trading the quad motor for a dual-motor system. It lasts an estimated 110 minutes while recharging in two and a half hours. Meanwhile, the Aiper Elite Pro skips the Seagull branding while offering high-end features at a slightly lower price than the Seagull Pro (although one big tradeoff is that the Elite Pro only covers 1,300 sq. ft.) It has a lightweight design, wall-cleaning capabilities and a dual-motor system. It can clean for two hours, the same time it takes to recharge. The Elite Pro arrives this Thursday for $800.</p><p>Aiper also highlights the Seagull SE, a budget water vacuum released in November. Although it only supports pools up to 850 sq. ft., it has dual drive motors and can run for 90 minutes (recharging in two and a half hours). The Seagull SE costs $300.</p>

(Although smartwatch cameras can sound privacy alarms, I see the value for children who don’t already have a smartphone camera.) The new model also lets parents add more safe zones, designated areas that the children can’t leave without the watch notifying their parents. The new model also doubles the number of trusted contacts parents can set up&nbsp;— from 10 to 20.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Gizmo Watch 3 gets a new processor in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-wear-4100-plus-150008576.html">Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 4100</a> platform. Verizon says the chip helps it add 80 percent more talk time and 20 percent more standby time than its predecessor. It also includes Bluetooth for the first time so that kids can pair the wearable with wireless earbuds or headphones. Additionally, it has new watch faces (including ones that change with the seasons and time of day) and three new games: Tic Tac Toe, Gizmo Says and Puzzle.</p><div id="b84caae38cc042f2877cf03ff5b6fb4a"></div><p>The Gizmo Watch 3 will be available through Verizon on Thursday in Blue Clay and Mint colors. Of course, if you don’t want to pay the full $150 upfront, the carrier will let qualified customers pay it off over 36 months.

## Disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried pleads not guilty to federal fraud charges

<p>Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced founder and former CEO of crypto exchange FTX, has pleaded not guilty to federal wire fraud charges and other crimes.

Prosecutors have accused Bankman-Fried of leading a multiyear scheme to defraud investors and customers of FTX. SBF faces a total of eight criminal charges, including multiple counts of wire fraud.

Prosecutors have accused Bankman-Fried of defrauding investors of almost $2 billion, or about twice the amount of money involved in the Theranos case. SBF has previously said that he "didn't ever try to commit fraud," and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/sam-bankman-fried-says-he-didnt-ever-try-commit-fraud-2022-11-30/">doesn't believe he's criminally liable</a> for the fall of FTX.</p><p>According to <em>The Times</em>, Bankman-Fried did not speak during the hearing. One of SBF's lawyers entered a not-guilty plea on his client's behalf. The trial is tentatively scheduled to start on October 2nd. Bahamian authorities <a href="https://www.engadget.com/former-ftx-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-arrested-in-bahamas-000800321.html">arrested Bankman-Fried on December 12th</a>.

<p>If you were hoping to spend your lunch break watching your favorite streamer play<em>, </em>you might be forced to change your plans. Twitch is currently experiencing an issue that is preventing parts of the platform, including channels and streams, from loading properly. According to <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/twitch/">Downdetector</a>, the outage began around 1PM ET. Since then, the website has logged more than 21,000 complaints that the streaming platform isn't working properly.&nbsp;</p><p>At 1:24PM ET, Twitch <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitchSupport/status/1610351823566606336?s=20&amp;t=IU9X3yrPx0aUTOAyzuDSmg">acknowledged the outage</a>. &quot;We are investigating an issue preventing multiple areas of Twitch from loading,&quot; the platform's official support account said on Twitter.

## Microsoft is now the home of the video game industry's largest union

<p>Quality assurance workers at ZeniMax Studios have voted in favor of forming a union with Communications Workers of America — and ZeniMax's parent company, Microsoft, didn't stand in the way. Microsoft formally recognized ZeniMax Workers United/CWA alongside today's vote results, making this the largest union in the video game industry and the first US union at Microsoft overall.</p><p>About 300 ZeniMax staff members were involved in the unionization effort, which was brewing for months before going <a href="https://www.engadget.com/quality-assurance-staff-microsoft-zenimax-media-unionization-222142495.html">public</a> in early December. This was around the time QA testers at another major video game studio, Blizzard Albany, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-second-qa-tester-union-vote-results-205949946.html">voted to unionize</a> with CWA. The Blizzard Albany union is the second at parent company Activision Blizzard, after QA staff at Raven Software <a href="https://www.engadget.com/raven-software-activision-blizzard-union-game-workers-alliance-195516977.html">voted to organize</a> in May 2022.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The employees behind ZeniMax Workers United/CWA argue that the union will help put an end to sudden periods of crunch, make pay more equitable, and improve communication with management, among other workplace benefits.

<p>We often see a bunch of healthcare-oriented gadgets coming out of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ces%202023/"><ins>CES</ins></a>, but Vivoo's latest offering isn't exactly a fitness tracker. The company has unveiled a smart toilet device that can test your urine and send the results to your phone.</p><p>The tech is built into a device that can clip onto existing toilets. Vivoo, which has offered at-home urine tests for the last few years, designed the system with residential care, the elderly and healthcare service providers in mind. It could give those who simply want to know more about what's going on with their body some additional data.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The device will automatically align a testing strip with a person's urine stream, according to Vivoo, which says this approach should reduce the risk of mess involved with a handheld strip. An optical reader akin to those used in hospitals analyzes the urine sample for four wellness parameters and delivers the results to the Vivoo app within 90 seconds. The company suggests that the results can offer "indications of certain deficiencies or abnormalities" and help with early detection of some conditions.</p><p>Vivoo says its app can provide data on your body's water, magnesium, pH, protein and sodium levels, among others, though disclaimers on <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Zpdm9vLmlvLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYmY3ZTM3NzgtOTI3MS00NDcwLTkwODYtYWNjM2FjNDI1ODQ0In0&amp;signature=AQAAAVVQ_OzGt7mC4v-mZeNBNL5FowYCUF_3mUsVlcZRMKjp&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fvivoo.io%2F"><ins>its website</ins></a> say these measurements are not intended for medical use. It offers nutrition advice based on the results and Vivoo may suggest personalized supplements.</p><p>The company claims it's easy to clean the smart toilet device. It adds that the system has an ergonomic design. However, based on images Vivoo provided, the device is positioned at the front of the toilet seat and it looks fairly cumbersome. Folks who need to sit to pee may find it difficult to position their legs around it, such as the elderly and those with mobility issues.</p>

## ASUS is bringing more Nebula Displays and better cooling to its gaming laptops

<p>ASUS is refreshing its gaming laptops with HDR Mini LED displays, better cooling and updated processors and graphics. However, since the company hasn’t yet announced pricing, it's harder to discern the latest models' value.</p><p>The Nebula display is found in more models than ever this year. That company branding denotes screens with high frame rates (120Hz for 4K and QHD screens and 240Hz or higher for 1080p), bright backlights and vivid colors. Meanwhile, the new Nebula HDR variant is like an ultra-premium version highlighting Mini LED panels. For example, the Nebula HDR display in the Strix SCAR 16 is a Mini LED with 1,024 dimming zones (double last year’s model) and a 240Hz refresh rate. Although we don't yet know the pricing, it's a safe bet those models will fetch top dollar.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The new laptops, which launch in Q2, also have updated 13th-gen Intel or AMD Ryzen Zen 4 processors, depending on your configuration. NVIDIA’s new GeForce RTX 40 Series Laptop GPUs power the graphics in maxed-out variants of the new machines.</p><p>ASUS added “intelligent cooling” to several new models, including the Zephyrus M16 and Strix models in 16-inch and 18-inch variants. The company accomplished this using a full-width heatsink spanning the device’s rear. ASUS also added a third cooling fan to more models. (It was first seen in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-flow-x16-specs-pricing-availability-130038649.html">Flow X16</a> from 2022.) That extra fan improves airflow to the GPU and other internal hardware.</p><p>The Strix SCAR line, which ASUS calls the “performance flagships,” have bigger 16- and 18-inch screens than their 15- and 17-inch predecessors (including Nebula HDR in the most expensive tiers). In addition, ASUS says this year’s cooling improvements let these models push higher frame rates. Meanwhile, the Strix G16 and G18 are slightly less high-end (likely cheaper) equivalents to the Strix 16 and 18 with the same CPU and GPU options.</p><figure><img alt="Product photo of ASUS Zephyrus M16 (2023) against a plain white background" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/6eac44c0-87b4-11ed-b7f5-73dad6949b74" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">ASUS</div></figure><p>ASUS is also updating its light-and-thin Zephyrus line. The ROG Zephyrus M16 has a Nebula HDR display. Like several other models, top-shelf models include a MUX Switch and NVIDIA Advanced Optimus. They bypass the machine’s integrated graphics, using discrete graphics almost instantaneously. The full-width heatsink and tri-fan tech also let it run 25 watts higher than the 2022 version.</p><p> Meanwhile, the Zephyrus G16 has the same processor and graphics options with a QHD Nebula display that supports 240Hz. Its smaller sibling, the Zephyrus G14, gets a Nebula HDR panel with 504 dimming zones and 600 nits of peak brightness.</p><p>ASUS’ Duo 16 is the latest iteration of its quirky, dual-screen laptop line. Like the 2022 model, the updated version has a 16-inch Mini LED panel as its main screen with a smaller 4K display below for multitasking. It also joins other models in offering the new NVIDIA graphics and MUX Switch in the highest-end models.</p><figure><img alt="PR lifestyle photo of a man playing the ASUS Flow Z13 gaming 2-in-1." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/cf32cf30-87b4-11ed-bace-ebba512f2661" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">ASUS</div></figure><p>The company also updated the ROG Flow, its 2-in-1 tablet PCs for gamers. The Flow X13, which has a 360-degree rotating hinge, has a 13-inch Nebula display supporting a 165Hz refresh rate. Additionally, ASUS redesigned its chassis, making it 10mm smaller and increasing its battery capacity (from 62 to 75 Wh) while maintaining the same keyboard layout. The company also made its touchpad bigger and redesigned the 2-in-1 hinge with better ventilation and an easier grip.</p><p>The X13’s larger companion, the Flow X16, has an HDR Mini LED touchscreen with a 240Hz refresh rate and 1,100 nits peak brightness. In addition, all ASUS’ 2023 Flow devices use Corning’s Gorilla Glass DXC, which can increase hardness by 40 percent and reduce glare. Meanwhile, the Flow Z13, a detachable that’s like a Microsoft Surface for gamers, is updated with the new Intel and NVIDIA components and a QHD Nebula display with a 165Hz refresh rate.</p>

<p>A new hands-on video was posted today of the alleged Google Pixel 7a. The 49-second clip shows a device that reflects <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pixel-7a-renders-leak-185809552.html">previous leaks and rumors</a> about Google’s next mid-ranged Pixel.</p><p>The device in question, posted on <a href="https://www.slashleaks.com/l/google-pixel-7a-hands-on-video-leaks-out"><em>Slashleaks</em></a> (first spotted by <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/01/03/pixel-7a-hands-on-leak/"><em>9to5Google</em></a>), looks similar to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6a-review-battery-life-camera-samples-170025138.html">Pixel 6a</a> and Google’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-7-and-pixel-7-pro-review-still-the-best-bargain-in-flagship-phones-170031940.html">2022 flagships</a>. The device name in Android 13 settings says “Pixel 7a,” and the handset runs internal pre-release (“design validation test”) software. The phone’s language is also set to Vietnamese, where Google manufactures its A-series phones.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The phone in question has a “Smooth Display” that can adjust its refresh rate from 60Hz to 90Hz — which would be a first in the A-series line. (The Pixel 6a’s 60Hz display is one of its most griped-about features.) Previous leaks suggested that the upcoming model uses a Samsung display and an upgraded primary camera sensor from Sony. Although today’s video leak doesn’t address it, previous rumors suggest the 7a will be the first A-series Pixel with wireless charging.</p><figure><img alt="Collage of three images showing a user holding an alleged Google Pixel 7a pre-production phone." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/2757f590-8b94-11ed-afba-2dfba399dc58" style="height: 844; width: 1500;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Slashleaks</div></figure><p>If history is any indication, Google will announce the new phone at Google I/O 2023 in May.

Smartphones and other devices that are WiFi 6E-compatible can take advantage of connections up to twice as fast as standard WiFi. A single Nest WiFi Pro unit will cover WiFi connections for up to 2,200 square feet. With three routers, that coverage extends to 6,600 square feet, and will also give you a mesh connection, which is best for both larger homes and homes with physical interference such as thick walls or multiple floors.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With an eye on appearance, Google gave these new routers a rounded design and glossy shell, which happens to be composed of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-wifi-pro-faster-speeds-high-gloss-design-130035266.html">60 percent recycled materials</a>.

A common frustration with smart home devices has been the inability of devices from different brands to work together. Created by the Connectivity Standards Alliance, a group that brought together Apple, Google, Amazon, Samsung and many other companies in the smart home market, Matter is a universal standard that aims to solve that frustration by letting devices work together more seamlessly. It'll also allow new smart home devices you bring home to be easier to connect in the first place. Not every device is Matter-enabled, but the new standard will likely apply to most smart home products going forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, if you're only in the market for something that will act as a Matter hub, you may already have what you need. When Google flipped the switch on Matter back in December, automatic updates turned many existing Google Home speakers and hubs into controllers for Matter. The iOS 16.1 update gave Matter support to iPhones and HomePods, and Amazon enabled Matter control on many newer Alexa devices shortly after Google did so.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to acting as a smart home hub, the Nest WiFi Pro routers also have built-in Thread network support, allowing connections to even more devices that run on that low-power wireless network. And if Google is your preferred smart home interface, you should be able to control everything through the Google  Home app.&nbsp;</p><p>Now that Google's newest routers are cheaper than ever, this might be a good time to invest in the latest in WiFi connectivity that supports both Matter and Thread control.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter and </em><a href="https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src"><em>subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em> for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/io%20interactive/"><ins>IO Interactive</ins></a> is making things easier to parse for newcomers to the Hitman series and giving <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/hitman%203/"><em><ins>Hitman 3</ins></em></a> owners who don't already own the previous two games a bonus. On January 26th, the company will rename <em>Hitman 3</em> to <em>Hitman: World of Assassination. </em>That's the moniker IOI gave to the recent rebooted trilogy. What's more, <em>Hitman: WOA </em>will include access to all three games.</p><p>Those who already owned <em>Hitman 1 </em>and <em>Hitman 2 </em>were supposed to be able to access levels from them in the third installment.

The Freelancer mode was supposed to debut last year, but it will <a href="https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-3-road-to-freelancer/">go live</a> on January 26th as well.</p><p>“We’re absolutely certain that these changes will have a hugely positive effect on existing players and new players alike.

For new players, who probably aren’t reading this here, they’ll have a much better experience buying Hitman games.”</p>

But with their revamped designs, the new G15 and G16 prove you don’t need to spend a ton of money to get an awesome-looking system.</p><p>Unlike Alienware laptops that appear as if they were beamed down from outer space, Dell’s latest <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=b1bb23c9-a2d4-4e4e-bfac-7a560ebe7641&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Dell&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJiMWJiMjNjOS1hMmQ0LTRlNGUtYmZhYy03YTU2MGViZTc2NDEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGVsbC5jb20vZW4tdXMvc2hvcC9nYW1pbmctbGFwdG9wcy9zci9nYW1lLWxhcHRvcHMvZy1zZXJpZXM_YXBwbGllZFJlZmluZW1lbnRzPTM4MDI2IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyZDI0NWVhNy04ZWVkLTQ3MTItOTBjNy1iOGFlZjg0ZDQzNzIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZwcEWdpZy1iDx5iXQdmBDngtpqG3UdpNH0AU5zhUbFU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fgaming-laptops%2Fsr%2Fgame-laptops%2Fg-series%3FappliedRefinements%3D38026">G-series gaming notebooks</a> seem to draw inspiration from gadgets in 80s sci-fi movies. You get simple lines with hard edges and bold two-tone paint jobs with neon/pastel accents. It’s the kind of style that makes me want to put on <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy55b3V0dWJlLmNvbS93YXRjaD92PWJGdVc1NEJqcTlFIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyZDI0NWVhNy04ZWVkLTQ3MTItOTBjNy1iOGFlZjg0ZDQzNzIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfHTAgrAJiPM0KiupTxLvooGGCLyekKXTflBz4_tQ6Fh&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DbFuW54Bjq9E">some synthwave</a> and fire up F-Zero. And while the colors may change on final retail units, I appreciate that Dell is even taking the time to paint small details like the radiator fins inside each laptop’s vents.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="975d124ba14c45bcbaca4494d5ba4271"></div><p>Another nice touch is the way Dell arranged ports on the G-series. Connectors for stuff like power and HDMI 2.1 that you probably won’t need to adjust very often are in back, which helps keep clutter to a minimum. And then on the sides you have access to a 3.5mm audio jack, Ethernet and two USB 3.2 Type-A ports, so you can easily plug in peripherals like a headset, mouse or thumb drive. I just wish Dell has swapped the position of the side-mounted Ethernet jack and the lone USB-C port in back for even better usability.</p><p>As for specs, both systems are well equipped considering their prices. The G15 will start at $849 for a 13th-gen Intel Core i5-13450HX CPU, 8GB of DDR5 RAM, and a 120Hz FHD non-touch display. You also have a selection of RTX 40-series GPUs from Nvidia with additional options like a slightly faster 165Hz screen and up to 2TB of NVMe storage.</p><figure><img alt="Even though the G-series line are budget gaming laptops, Dell still paid attention to small details like the color-matched accent logos on the side of the system.

And like its smaller sibling, you can upgrade components like the GPU, memory (up to 32GB) or the display (to a faster 240Hz panel). Both systems can even be configured with larger 86 WHr batteries in case the standard 56 WHr doesn’t cut it.</p><p>The two small cons I noticed are that weighing 5.84 and 6.01 pounds respectively, the G15 and G16 are a bit on the heavy side. I’m also slightly disappointed to see Dell go with 720p webcams on both models. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, all new laptops should have at least 1080p cameras, regardless of price.</p><figure><img alt="To help cut down on clutter from wires, Dell moved most of the G15 and G16's ports to the back." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/29d63820-8a38-11ed-bf6f-f71f274c1d78" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Unfortunately, the models Dell demoed were non-functional pre-production units, so I didn’t have a chance to check out how smooth games ran or the single-zone RGB backlit keyboard. But for relatively affordable systems, I think Dell has created a really nice balance of style and performance.</p><p>Both the G15 and G16 are expected to go on sale sometime in Q1 2023, though there’s no word on pricing yet. Additionally, for people looking for non-Intel based configs, the company says there will be versions of both systems with AMD chips available slightly later in Q2.</p>

The inventively named 24.5-inch 500Hz Gaming Monitor has a Full HD display and a native refresh rate of 480Hz, which overclocks to 500Hz.</p><p>The monitor has an IPS panel and NVIDIA has certified it as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-27-nvidia-gsync-compatible-gaming-monitors.html/">G-Sync compatible</a>, so it should deliver smooth, tear-free gameplay if you have a supported graphics card. It also has 99 percent sRGB color coverage and VESA DisplayHDR 400, which should help to deliver accurate colors and vibrant visuals at wider viewing angles. Alienware added that the TUV-certified ComfortView Plus feature will help to display true-to-life colors while reducing blue light.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There's a GtG response time of 0.5ms.

Dell's gaming brand has been on a roll over the last few years with its bold "Legend" design language, which veered into a very sci-fi aesthetic, as well as its super-thin X series notebooks. This year, Legend is being refined for a third time with a focus on "form, function and quality." Alienware's new machines still look strikingly different than most other gaming laptops, but now they're easier to hold, open and, thankfully, there's no more glossy black plastic to be seen.</p><div id="99bfd92842f64e7ba20222e0a8927f74"></div><p>Perhaps the most striking example of Legend 3.0 is Alienware's new m18, its largest and most powerful gaming laptop yet. This beast sports an 18-inch screen that's 14.5-percent larger than the previous 17-inch model. Clearly, portability isn't the main concern here, it's power. The m18 features all of the latest hardware, including Intel's fastest 13th-gen HX mobile processors, NVIDIA's latest GPUs, or alternatively you can configure with an AMD Ryzen chip with next-gen Radeon graphics.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While it's just as thick as the previous m17, the 18-inch Alienware also crams in far better cooling, with a vapor chamber that covers the GPU and CPU, seven heat pipes, and four fans for 25 percent better airflow. You'll be able to add an optional Cherry MX mechanical keyboard, up to 9TB of storage and choose between 165Hz quad-HD and 480Hz 1080p screens. With a total system power of 250-watts, the m18 is clearly meant for the most demanding gamers out there, people who won't mind lugging around a huge notebook. If you were intrigued by Alienware's massive Area 51m, its now defunct laptop that used replaceable desktop components, the m18 may be a solid option.</p><figure><img alt="Dell Alienware m18" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/90210910-87c3-11ed-affc-59a42ff7f4ba" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>For the more sensible players out there, there's the smaller Alienware m16, which features the same design and similar cooling upgrades. That computer can be equipped with 16-inch quad-HD+ (2,560 by 1,600) panels running at 165Hz or 240Hz, or with a 480Hz FHD+ screen. Both m-series laptops feature NVIDIA G-SYNC and AMD FreeSDync support, wide color gamuts and Dell's ComfortView Plus technology, which reduces harsh blue light.</p><p>If the Alienware m16 and m18 look a bit chunky compared to most other gaming laptops, that's pretty much by design. That's always been the company's line for bigger and more powerful machines. If you want something slimmer and perhaps more fashionable, you'll have to look to the X-series notebooks. Last year we got the Alienware x14, which was impressively thin for all the power it held. This year, the company is introducing the x16, which, you guessed it, sports a 16-inch screen.</p><p>Alienware is calling the x16 its design highlight of the year, with a tall 16 by 10 display and a stronger all-metal case. It even manages to fit in a six-speaker sound system, with two upward-firing tweeters and two woofers for solid bass. Under the hood, it's powered by Intel's fastest non-HX 13th-gen CPUs, all the way up to the 14-core 13900HK and NVIDIA's full suite of RTX 4000 GPUs. Alienware says it can also be equipped with AMD's next-gen hardware, but we don't have specifics on that yet.</p><section><img alt="Dell Alienware x14" class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/901a7960-87c3-11ed-afc5-d4aca7add555" /></section><p>The x16 looks just as striking as Alienware's previous thin gaming laptops, but the new Legend aesthetic makes it appear more refined. It also has all the bling you'd want, with over 100 micro-LEDs along its rear lighting panel, RGB lighting across all of its keys, and an RGB touchpad that's also 15 percent bigger than the previous x17's. Now I'm still not sure why you'd want RGB lighting on a touchpad, but it sure does look cool. The x16's 6-pound weight may be a problem for some buyers though, especially since Razer's Blade 17 pretty much matches it.</p><p>As you'd expect, the Alienware x14 also makes a return this year, and it still looks impressive. It sports a new 14-inch quad-HD+ screen running at 165Hz, and its hardware is less beefy than the 16-inch model, topping out with one of Intel's 13th-gen Core i7 CPUs and NVIDIA's RTX 4060. That's the price you'll have to pay for such a thin case though. Alienware claims it's still the thinnest 14-inch gaming notebook on the market, though, measuring at just 14.5mm.</p><p>All of Alienware's new machines will be available in the first quarter with Intel and NVIDIA configurations, while AMD options will arrive in the second quarter. The m18 will start at $2,899 with high-end options, though Alienware says entry-level models starting at $2,099 will arrive later. The m16, meanwhile, will initially run you $2,599, with future configurations starting at $1,899. The Alienware x16 will be the priciest of the bunch, starting at an eye-watering $3,099 for high-end configs and $2,150 for future entry-level options. And last, but not least, you can expect to pay at least $1,799 for the x14.</p><p>Choosing any notebook, especially gaming machines, always amounts to weighing potential compromises. At least now <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=b1bb23c9-a2d4-4e4e-bfac-7a560ebe7641&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Dell&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJiMWJiMjNjOS1hMmQ0LTRlNGUtYmZhYy03YTU2MGViZTc2NDEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGVsbC5jb20vZW4tdXMvc2hvcC9kZWxsLWxhcHRvcHMvc2YvYWxpZW53YXJlLWxhcHRvcHMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImQxNGRhMmU2LTI4ZTMtNGFkZi04NmFmLTExNTkwZDg2NWU1OSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAUBc9CV2HnJFqbq8hx4lEbwtVJnhWJG2W6bnJRTQGMkb&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdell-laptops%2Fsf%2Falienware-laptops">Alienware</a> has a machine for practically everyone, from the style conscious to people who want an even more desktop-like experience on the go.</p>

## Acer updates its range of gaming laptops for 2023

<p>One problem with Acer’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/acer-nitro-5-ryzen-6000-181528055.html">Nitro marque</a> is that it’s hard to shake the perception it’s the scrawny kid brother of its brawny Predator range. You know, the gaming laptop you buy when money’s tight but you need something newer than what you’re rocking at the given time. It’s an issue Acer itself is trying to address by trying to give the Nitro more of its own identity, and pushing it to be more distinct from its bigger, more attention-hogging sibling.</p><p>As with Acer’s other rebrands, the Nitro loses the odd-number coding in favor of being described by display sizes. So, at CES, you’ll find the Nitro 16 and Nitro 17, each one packing a 16- and 17.3-inch display, respectively. What hasn’t changed much is the styling, which keeps that, uh, Razer-esque minimalism (bar the rear exhaust vents) from the previous generation. That’s not a bad thing, I should add, since there’s little need for curling arcs of faux-chrome plastic to make it look butch in front of your friends at the LAN party.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Naturally, both machines come with the pick of a 13th-generation Intel Core i5 / i7 processors paired with up to 32GB RAM. You’ll be able to marry up both with a 40-series NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPU, which will enable you to switch from integrated to discrete graphics without rebooting. And both will come with a four-zone RGB backlit keyboard, to let you mark out your individuality in lighting choices as much as you can manage.</p><p>Acer is also swinging big about the promises that these machines can handle a far longer load than its predecessors. And users will be able to access the NitroSense UI from a dedicated key, letting them keep an eye on the temperatures when things are getting intense. Connectivity wise, you’ll get the expected ports (HDMI 2.1, microSD, two Thunderbolt 4 with PD and three USB 3.2 Gen 2. But the overall vibe here is a machine that you shouldn’t feel second-class while gaming with it.</p><p>Both machines are coming to the US in May, with prices starting from $1,200, although you can expect that figure to climb as soon as you start speccing it up properly.</p><figure><img alt="Image of the new Predator Helios 16 (2023)" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/12c92b70-8848-11ed-b0fb-cfa5c62f7e2c" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Acer</div></figure><p>Now, for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/acer-predator-gaming-laptop-helios-triton-2022-181520684.html">Predators</a>, with two new Helios models available with either 16- or an 18-inch display. Both have had their own muted, more professional redesign, and come with the choice of a 13th-generation Intel Core i7 or i9 processor, paired with a 40-series GeForce RTX GPU. Naturally, you can pair that with up to 32GB RAM and up to 2TB in storage, with other, less expensive spec options in the mix.</p><p>If theres a major shift in the components, it’s in the mini-LED backlit keyboard, which the company promises will offer less halo effect and smoother lighting effects. You will also be able to spot some gaps in the keyboard, as the laptop draws cool air in from between your fingers to help keep those beefy components working at the right temperature.</p><p>And speaking of which, one neat little addition is a pair of spare cowls for the laptop’s rear deck exhaust fans. These, we’re told, can be painted or customized in any way that you desire, letting you add a small touch of yourself to what’s otherwise the most anonymous part of the machine.</p><p>The 16-inch Helios will be making its way to these shores in March, with prices starting at $1,650, while the 18-incher won’t arrive until April, with a vanilla model costing you $1,700.</p>

## Acer simplifies its Swift laptop lineup for 2023
 - [https://www.engadget.com/acer-swift-lineup-ces-2023-170023212.html?src=rss](https://www.engadget.com/acer-swift-lineup-ces-2023-170023212.html?src=rss)

<p>No shade on Acer before now, but I’ve always found its laptop naming scheme to be a little bit obtuse. For instance, can you tell me the qualitative difference between Acer’s Swift 3 and Swift 5 <em>without looking?</em> To address this, the company has dumped its odd-numbers system in favor of categorizing everything by screen size. So, here at CES, Acer is now showing off the Swift Go 14 and 16, as well as the Swift 14 and the Swift X 14 — although, on reflection, that’s still a <em>lot</em> of Swifts, isn’t it.</p><p>The Swift Go models are the successors of the Swift 3 series, mainstream machines with an eye on keeping things thin and light. There are two models, both of which get the option of three different displays, all of which are 16:10. The 14-inch unit gets the option of a (deep breath) 2,880 x 1,800 90Hz OLED display, a 2,240 x 1,400 IPS LCD or a 1,920 x 1,200 IPS LCD. The bigger sibling, meanwhile, gets the choice of a 16-inch 3,200 x 2,000 120Hz OLED, a 2,560 x 1,600 IPS LCD, or a 1,920 x 1,200 IPS LCD (one of which will be touch, but the spec sheet I have doesn’t say which one.)</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Nestled inside, you’ll find the usual raft of spec-to-order 13th generation Intel Core processors, including the option of an H-series chip instead of a U. These, Acer say, will be able to run at full pelt thanks to the new-and-improved cooling in the new machines. That will be teamed up with up to 16GB LPDDR5 RAM and up to 2TB of SSD storage, while both models have USB-C with Thunderbolt 4, HDMI 2.1, a microSD-card reader and a 1440p webcam. If you’re looking to snap one up, you’ll have to wait until May for the 14-inch model and June for the 16-incher, with prices starting from $850 for the former and $800 for the latter.</p><figure><img alt="Image of Acer's Swift 14 (2023) model." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/b062b1b0-882c-11ed-a3f3-1eb2795c8902" style="height: 1080; width: 1800;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Acer</div></figure><p>In the middle of the pack, you’ll find Acer’s suffix-free Swift 14 (formerly the Swift 5), of which the company has little to talk about, compared to its siblings. That’s a shame, because it might also be the best-looking, with the dark green and copper model destined to become an object of unbridled desire. Weighing in at 2.64 pounds, the Evo-certified machine offers a choice of 13th-generation Intel Core processors. And you’ll get the pick of two different touchscreens, a 1,920 x 1,200 panel or a glitzier 2,560 x 1,600 model. Connectivity-wise, it’s also blessed, with two USB-C, HDMI-out, 3.5mm and a pair of USB A sockets, perfect for those of us who haven’t upgraded all our accessories. If this model catches your fancy (have I mentioned how good looking it is) then it’ll hit these shores in April, with the base model priced at $1,400.</p><figure><img alt="Image of Acer's flagship Swift X" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/d1962510-882c-11ed-bdbf-d2b51bc2820e" style="height: 1080; width: 1800;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Acer</div></figure><p>Last, but quite obviously not least is the flagship <a href="https://www.engadget.com/acer-swift-x-geforce-rtx-30-series-thin-and-light-134500570.html">Swift X 14</a>, although there’s less that’s new and gosh-darn exciting to mention about this unit. It’ll offer H-series Intel Core chips paired with a new GeForce RTX GPU, the name of which hasn’t yet been disclosed. Here, the company says that the NVIDIA Studio-rated machine will get the benefit of lots of new cooling, thanks to a new air inlet keyboard that draws air in between your fingers. You’ll be staring into either a 14.5-inch 2,880 x 1,800 120Hz OLED display or a 14.5-inch 2,560 x 1,600 IPS LCD unit. And, much like the other machines in the refresh, you’ll get a 1440p webcam to capture the full extent of your beauty as you share it with the world. This model will land in the US in April, with the base model priced at $1,100, although I’d imagine any half decent spec will push that figure up pretty swiftly.</p>

The company has <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-ada-lovelace-breaks-energy-efficiency-barrier-supercharges-170+-laptop-designs-for-gamers-and-creators">introduced</a> RTX 40 GPUs for laptops that promise large leaps in performance, even in lower-end systems. The flagship RTX 4080 and 4090 GPUs are reportedly powerful enough to play games across three 4K monitors at 60 frames per second — you might not need a desktop to immerse yourself in a flight or racing sim.</p><p>Even the mainstream GeForce RTX 4050, 4060 and 4070 chips are billed as faster than the outgoing RTX 3080. They're quick enough to deliver 1440p gaming at up to 80FPS, and are supposedly up to twice as fast as a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-games-for-ps5-playstation-5-171511880.html">PlayStation 5</a>. They also make it more practical to handle pro tasks like 3D modelling and AI-based media editing on 14-inch laptops, according to NVIDIA.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The RTX 40 architecture is notoriously power-hungry on desktops, but NVIDIA claims it's keeping energy efficiency in check with the laptop variants. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-dlss-3-ada-lovelace-160404110.html">DLSS 3</a> AI upscaling is now optimized for mobile use, while finer-grained &quot;tri-speed&quot; memory control lets the GPU drop to lower-power RAM states. On-chip memory tweaks(such as doubled bandwidth) and low-voltage GDDR6 RAM also help wring the most out of the video hardware.</p><p>You'll have to wait a little while to buy a laptop with GeForce RTX 40 tech. The first RTX 4080 and 4090 models will be available February 8th at a starting price of $1,999. If you want an RTX 4050 machine, you can buy them beginning February 22nd with an entry price of $999. NVIDIA didn't provide a full list of laptops, but you can expect adoption from well-known brands like Acer, Alienware, ASUS, Dell, Gigabyte, HP, Lenovo, MSI, Razer and Samsung. It's too soon to say if the GPUs live up to NVIDIA's billing, but they'll be welcome updates if you were already eying RTX 30-based computers.</p>

## NVIDIA's GeForce Now game streaming is coming to cars

<p>You'll soon have access to a host of PC games in your car without <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-steam-model-s-x-054406511.html">buying a Tesla</a>. NVIDIA has announced that it's bringing GeForce Now game streaming to cars using the company's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-autonomous-vehicle-chipset-drive-thor-164538911.html">Drive platform</a>. The rollout will offer access to titles like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on a driver display while you're charging or parked, or any time from the backseat. That could be more than a little helpful on a vacation, especially if you'd rather not buy a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-review-small-hands-180026719.html">Steam Deck</a> or Switch for a budding young gamer.</p><p>The cloud gaming option already has initial support from major brands like the Hyundai group (including Genesis and Kia), Polestar and China's BYD. NVIDIA didn't offer a timeframe for GeForce Now access, although it noted that BYD would offer Drive Hyperion-powered cars in the first half of 2023. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/polestar-3-suv-release-date-price-193711445.html">Polestar 3</a> SUV (built using Drive Orin) arrives in late 2023.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The in-car GeForce Now client works on either Android or web-based infotainment systems. NVIDIA's service provides a catalog of 1,500 games, over 1,000 of which are playable using gamepads. While most of the selection is paid, there are free-to-play options like <em>Destiny 2</em> and <em>Fortnite</em>.</p><p>As with other game streaming services, this could get costly if you plan to use it often. While basic GeForce Now use is free, you can pay up to $200 per year for the full experience before you factor in the cost of the games themselves. In some cases, though, this might make more sense than buying a handheld console or tablet. You only need to pay for a higher-end plan when you expect to use it, after all — you could subscribe during a road trip and stick to free usage when you're commuting around town.</p>

## NVIDIA unveils the $799 RTX 4070 Ti

<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-rtx-4070-ti-leak-specs-price-ces-2023-210303412.html">rumors were true</a>: NVIDIA finally unveiled its latest mid-range GPU, the RTX 4070 Ti. Starting at $799, it's meant to be a slightly more reasonable alternative to NVIDIA's $1,199 RTX 4090 and $1,599 4090. But yes, it's still pretty costly — gone are the days when &quot;mid-range&quot; video cards were below $500. For the price, though you get a GPU that can play <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> three times as fast as the RTX 3090 Ti in Ray Tracing Overdrive mode (according to NVIDIA, at least).</p><p>While the RTX 4080 and 4090 Ti are targeted at 4K gaming, NVIDIA is positioning the RTX 4070 Ti as the pinnacle of 1,440p gaming beyond 120fps. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-dlss-3-ada-lovelace-160404110.html">DLSS 3 </a>is a big reason for that — just like with the other 4000-series cards, it uses machine learning to generate entire frames, rather than the pixels DLSS 2 created. That means it should be able to deliver better overall framerates, especially when it comes to CPU-bound titles.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As the leaks foretold, the RTX 4070 Ti features 7,680 CUDA cores and 12GB of GDDR6X memory. In comparison, the 4080 sports 9,728 CUDA cores and 16GB of memory, while the 4090 has 16,384 CUDA cores and 24GB of RAM. Since it's supposedly comparable to the 3090 Ti, you can expect the 4070 Ti to handle a bit of 4K gaming, especially with the help of DLSS 3. But really, it seems more like the card gamers with fast 1,440p monitors have been waiting for.</p><p>Surprisingly, NVIDIA didn't spend much time on the 4070 Ti during its CES livestream, even though it will likely be the most popular 40-series GPU this year. If you're looking for more of a bargain, NVIDIA's 30-series GPUs are still fantastic and should start dipping in price soon. But for someone who wants the full power of NVIDIA's Ada architecture, as well as DLSS 3, the 4070 Ti is the cheapest way in.</p><p>The RTX 4070 Ti will be available on January 5th, and you can expect to see a variety of options from different manufacturers.</p>

## South Korea fines Tesla $2.2 million over EV range disclosures

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/tesla/"><ins>Tesla</ins></a> has suffered another blow after a South Korea regulator said it would fine the company 2.85 billion won ($2.24 million) for failing to disclose the shorter ranges of its electric vehicles in low temperatures. The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) said that Tesla EV ranges drop by up to 50.5 percent in cold weather, compared with the ranges that the company stated online.</p><p>The antitrust agency claimed that Tesla exaggerated the ranges of its vehicles on a single charge, the performance of Superchargers and fuel cost effectiveness versus combustion engine vehicles, as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/south-korea-fines-tesla-22-mln-exaggerating-driving-range-evs-2023-01-03/"><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a> reports. The KFTC said that Tesla did so on its South Korean website between August 2019 and recently.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Studies have shown that ranges for all EVs can drop significantly in colder weather, mainly because the battery that's used to power those cars also heats the interior. Based on data from South Korea's environment ministry, a local consumer group claimed in 2021 that the ranges of most EVs drop by up to 40 percent in cold weather. Tesla's vehicles saw the biggest drop, according to Citizens United for Consumer Sovereignty. Tesla doesn't have a communications department that can be reached for comment.</p><p>While the fine is a relatively small one, it's more bad news for Tesla. The company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-delivers-record-405278-vehicles-during-q4-2022-203616206.html"><ins>said on Monday</ins></a> that it set a new quarterly record for EV deliveries in the last three months of 2022 with more than 405,000 (an increase of nearly 97,000 compared with a year earlier). However, analysts expected Tesla to deliver 418,000 EVs last quarter. By 10:30AM ET on Tuesday, Tesla's stock had dropped by over 10 percent compared with Monday. The company's share price has plummeted by 72 percent over the last 12 months.</p>

<p>SpaceX is gearing up to launch the Transporter-6 mission today, January 3rd, and is hoping that the Falcon 9 rocket taking it to space will begin making its way to low-Earth orbit by 9:56 AM ET. The Transporter-6 mission will take off from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral in Florida using a first stage booster responsible for taking over a dozen other previous missions to orbit, including 10 Starlink launches. It's the company's first launch of the year and the latest in SpaceX's series of dedicated rideshare Transporter missions.</p><p>Transporter-6 will take 114 payload to space. As <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2023/01/spacex-transporter-6/"><em>NASA Spaceflight</em></a> notes, those include tiny picosatellites only a few centimeters in size to microsatellites that weight around 200 pounds for both scientific institutions and commercial entities. One customer is EOS Data Analytics, which will <a href="https://www.space.com/watch-spacex-1st-rocket-launch-2023-transporter-6-rideshare-satellites">launch the first satellite</a> for its agriculture-focused constellation on this mission. A couple of companies is also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/02/startups-spacex-transporter-6-mission/">launching space tugs</a>, or spacecraft that can transfer cargo from one orbit to another, that will deploy payload for customers of their own at a later date.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>SpaceX will livestream the Transporter-6 launch on YouTube, with coverage starting 10 minutes before liftoff is expected to happen.

## Apple is raising the price of battery replacements for older iPhones on March 1st

<p>You'll want to act quickly if you're considering a fresh battery for an aging iPhone. <em>9to5Mac</em> has <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/01/02/apple-raising-prices-of-battery-replacement-for-older-iphone-models/">noticed</a> that Apple is <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cHBvcnQuYXBwbGUuY29tL2lwaG9uZS9yZXBhaXIvYmF0dGVyeS1yZXBsYWNlbWVudCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNDI2MWZjNDgtMDk5MC00ZjM1LWJlMDEtMDVhYmNhMDllY2Q1In0&amp;signature=AQAAAVOl9NP2nMcTyt3Xx6op1wyBFr-GVcCO9tuxBiYu_md-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com%2Fiphone%2Frepair%2Fbattery-replacement">raising</a> the price of battery replacements for pre-<a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-14-review-camera-test-sample-pictures-notch-specs-battery-life-130022134.html">iPhone 14</a> models by $20 on March 1st. For notched iPhones (iPhone X through iPhone 13), this will bump the price from $69 to $89. If you have an iPhone SE, iPhone 8 or a similarly classic design, the price will climb from $49 to $69. The cost of a replacement for the iPhone 14 family was already higher at $99.</p><p>It's not clear if self-repair prices will increase at the same time. However, part prices tend to roughly equal the cost of asking Apple to perform a battery swap. Don't be surprised if the do-it-yourself option costs more in the near future.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apple didn't explain the price hike in a notice on its website. We've asked the company for comment. The tech giant last set iPhone battery service prices in 2019, when it ended a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-15-apple-battery-upgrades-iphone-sales.html">one-year $29 replacement offer</a> made in response to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-12-28-apple-apologizes-for-iphone-battery-confusion.html">uproar over CPU throttling</a>. The company discounted prices to help apologize for its initial approach to battery degradation. It slowed performance to prevent sudden shutdowns on iPhones with worn-down batteries, but didn't tell customers or give them the option to override the throttling.</p><p>The new prices are still low enough to justify a battery replacement instead of a whole new phone. There's no doubt the increase will sting, though, and it may be particularly painful if your device is several years old (such as an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-11-03-apple-iphone-x-review.html">iPhone X</a>) and may lose other forms of support relatively soon, such as major OS updates.</p>

<p>Intel is bringing the power of its 13th-gen desktop CPUs down to laptops — all 24 cores worth. At CES today, Intel unveiled the Core i9-13980HX, the pinnacle of its mobile lineup. It features 24 cores (a combination of 8 Performance cores and 16 Efficient cores) and a boost speed of a whopping 5.6GHz. It's the continuation of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intels-12th-gen-hx-cpus-16-cores-150044585.html">Intel's high performance HX line</a>, which debuted last year as a way to bring more power to beefier laptops. The company claims the new Core i9 CPU is 11 percent faster than last year's top-end 12900HK when it comes to single-threaded tasks, and it's 49 percent faster for multithreaded work (intensive tasks like encoding video and 3D rendering).</p><p>Intel's 13th-gen HX lineup scales all the way down to the Core i5-13450HX, which offers 10 cores (6P, 4E) and up to 4.5Ghz boost speeds. Basically, if you're hankering for more performance and don't mind a hit to battery life, there should be an HX chip within your budget. The rest of Intel's 13th-gen lineup looks noteworthy, as well. The P series chips, which are meant for performance ultraportables, will reach up to 14 cores, while the low-power U-series CPUs top out at 10 cores (2P, 8E) with the i7-1365U.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Intel 13th-gen HX CPU lineup" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/521e9e60-8ab7-11ed-afe3-d0e6607b0515" style="height: 707; width: 892;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Intel</div></figure><p>We weren't too impressed with Intel's previous P-series CPUs on laptops like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dell-xps-13-plus-review-beauty-usability-120015270.html">XPS 13 Plus </a>— the performance gains seemed negligible for most tasks, while the battery life hit was massive. Hopefully Intel has made some improvements with its new lineup. The company also claims select 13th-gen chips will offer VPU (Vision Processing Unit) AI accelerators, which can help offload tasks like background blurring during video calls. The lack of a VPU was one major downside to the Intel-equipped Surface Pro 9 (and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/surface-pro-9-5g-review-sq3-arm-173012304.html">one major advantage for the Arm model</a>), so it'll be nice to see some sort of AI acceleration this year.</p><p>Another pleasant surprise: New low-end chips. Intel <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-artemis-1-orion-spacecraft-returns-kennedy-space-center-220905600.html">quietly killed its Pentium and Celeron branding</a> last year — now we've learned that they've been replaced with new N-series chips, simply dubbed Intel Processor and Intel Core i3. These chips are mainly focused on education and other entry-level computing markets, subsequently they're only equipped with E-cores. Intel says its quad-core N200 chip offers 28 percent better application performance and 64 percent faster graphics than the previous-gen Pentium Silver N6000. Bumping up to the 8-core i3 N-305 adds an additional 42 percent in application performance and 56 percent faster graphics. Sure, we all want a 24-core laptop, but better low-end chips have the potential to help kids and other users who don't need a boatload of power.</p><p>Aside from laptops, Intel also roundup out its 13th-gen desktop CPU lineup at CES. They'll still reach up to 24 cores like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-13th-gen-cpus-raptor-lake-162054801.html">enthusiast-level K series chips</a>, but they'll &quot;only&quot; go up to 5.6GHz boost speeds, instead of 5.8Ghz. The company says they're 11 percent faster in single-threaded performance and up to 34 percent faster when it comes to multi-threaded tasks. The 13th-gen desktop chips will also be compatible with 600 and 700-series motherboards, and they'll work with either DDR5 or DDR4 memory, making them decent upgrades for modern Intel systems.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/dell/">Dell</a> has pulled back the curtain on several UltraSharp monitors, including what it claims is the first 6K monitor with an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dell-u3223qz-monitor-annoucement-180029395.html/">IPS Black</a> panel. It says the screen delivers 41 percent deeper blacks and up to 1.2 times better color accuracy than regular IPS panels. The 31.5-inch monitor has 150 percent more pixels than a 4K display as well.</p><p>The Dell UltraSharp 32 6K Monitor is said to have a wide color gamut with support for 99 percent DCI-P3 and 99 percent Display P3, as well as VESA DisplayHDR 600. These should deliver accurate colors from more angles than you might be used to on older monitors. There's a built-in, dual-gain HDR 4K webcam with auto framing and light adjustment features, along with an automatic shutter. The monitor also has an echo cancellation mic and dual 14W speakers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Dell UltraSharp 32 6K Monitor" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/15e95170-8309-11ed-be6f-80fe68cf68b7" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dell</div></figure><p>If you like, you can connect two PCs (or other video sources) and use them both simultaneously with the picture-by-picture (PBP) and picture-in-picture (PIP) functions. The monitor has DisplayPort 2.1 and Thunderbolt 4 connectivity, as well as a front-facing port panel you can pop out when you need it.</p><p>Moreover, you can tilt, pivot, swivel and adjust the height of the Dell UltraSharp 32 6K Monitor. The display will be available in Q2 (between April and June). Dell will reveal pricing in the coming months.</p><figure><img alt="Dell UltraSharp 34 Curved USB-C Hub Monitor" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/bea370c0-8309-11ed-9f7f-1f9a3938da56" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dell</div></figure><p>For those who may be interested in a new monitor but aren't swayed by the 6K model (and maybe want more screen real estate), Dell has a few other new ones up its sleeve. For one thing, it unveiled a curved WQHD monitor with IPS Black tech that supports a 2,000:1 contrast ratio along with 98 percent DCI-P3 and 100 percent sRGB color coverage.</p><p>The Dell UltraSharp 34 Curved USB-C Hub Monitor supports PBP and PIP and has dual 5W speakers. The always-on ComfortView Plus function is said to reduce blue light without compromising on color. The 34-inch monitor, which delivers up to 90W of power through its USB-C connector, will be available on January 31st for $1,260.</p><p>There's another addition to Dell's monitor lineup in the form of the UltraSharp 43 4K USB-C Hub. You can connect up to four PCs (or other inputs) to this one and switch between them. Alternatively, you can view all four PCs while controlling them with a single keyboard and mouse. Dell also touts the ability to split one input into four partitions, which sounds pretty similar to having four equal-size windows open. The monitor has handy pop-out USB-A and USB-C charging ports too. This 43-inch monitor will be available on January 31st, and it will run you $1,330.</p><figure><img alt="Dell UltraSharp 43 4K USB-C Hub Monitor" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/d01736c0-8309-11ed-aa3f-f8652e505ff3" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dell</div></figure><p></p>

## Dell's Concept Nyx gamepad sure is... something
 - [https://www.engadget.com/dell-concept-nyx-game-controller-140005477.html?src=rss](https://www.engadget.com/dell-concept-nyx-game-controller-140005477.html?src=rss)

<p>Last year Dell <a href="https://www.engadget.com/alienware-concept-nyx-game-server-050141873.html">showed off Concept Nyx</a>, its vision for a server that could let you play games on screens throughout your home. Perhaps you could start a game on your bedroom TV and then continue it in your living room — and if someone else was using that set, you could also share that larger screen. I'll admit, I was far from sold on the idea, especially after Engadget's Cherlynn Low and I were forced to go head-to-head in two separate <em>Rocket League</em> windows on a single TV screen. It looked more like the waste of a perfectly good 65-inch TV, instead of being the future of gaming.</p><div id="4c7b522969214085ba92a4e045d1efe0"></div><p>Now Dell and Alienware have returned with another Concept Nyx accessory: A truly baffling PC gamepad. Like a cross between Valve's ambitious-yet-flawed Steam Controller, Sony's DualSense and the latest Xbox offering, it sports a trackpad of a directional pad, two analog sticks, the usual face and top buttons, and adaptive triggers. There are also two rear shift buttons, as well as dual scroll-wheels along the bottom to easily change your settings.  And if that's not enough functionality for you, the two top buttons also have capacitive sensing, allowing you to slide your finger slowly across them for different affects.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>I can trace my love of gadgets back to the first time I held an NES controller at the age of five, so I was initially intrigued by the Nyx controller. It's certainly leagues ahead of Dell's previous &quot;UFO&quot; pad, which resembled the Atari's failed Jaguar controller more than anything modern. The Nyx gamepad feels like a premium device Dell could actually sell, with sturdy build quality and a familiar Xbox-like feel.</p><p>The demo gods weren't in Dell's favor during our briefing, unfortunately, so we couldn't play any games with the Nyx controller. Just from holding it though, it felt somewhat incomplete. Perhaps I'm too used to the idea of directional pads, but I still find them essential, especially when playing Metroidvania  games or anything that hearkens back to the classic 2D era. The Nyx's circular trackpad could be fine for some PC games, but I still prefer having the confidence of a real directional pad. If Valve can manage to shove <em>two</em> trackpads alongside a D-pad on the Steam Deck, surely Dell could find some more room for a trackpad.</p><p>Dell could be trying to one-up Valve's original Steam Controller, which took a huge risk by prominently featuring two circular trackpads to help replicate the feeling of mouse and keyboard controls. But while that device had its fans, I could never adapt to it. There's a reason why console controllers ultimately settled on a fairly standard design: It just works.</p>

As part of its refreshed Bespoke smart home appliances lineup, Samsung has revealed a new high-tech oven. The new range also includes a washer and dryer, so maybe we haven’t quite moved on.</p><p>The highlight is its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-bespoke-smartthings-wall-oven-hood-fridge-sustainability-164725174.html">Bespoke AI Oven</a>. It has a seven-inch screen and touch controls, and features air sous-vide, air frying, and steam cooking methods. The most intriguing element is the AI Camera inside. The camera can detect what you're making and suggest optimal cooking settings if it recognizes the cuisine. You can even monitor the cooking using the screen or the SmartThings app (which you can use to control the oven remotely).</p><p>There's also the option to take photos of your creation or even livestream the video feed.

## Samsung's prototype Flex Hybrid OLED mobile display can both slide and fold

<p>Last year at CES, Samsung folded its displays <a href="https://global.samsungdisplay.com/29253/">nearly every way</a> you could think of, but this year it's combining that with another trick — sliding. The <a href="https://global.samsungdisplay.com/31057">Flex Hybrid OLED</a> mobile screen, debuting at CES 2023, can both fold from one side and slide out on the other, changing both the size and aspect ratio.&nbsp;</p><p>Starting off at a relatively compact 4.2-inches or so wide, it can fold out to a 10.5-inch 4:3 display suitable for productivity. You can then slide out the right side to create a 12.4-inch display with a 16:10 aspect ratio. That would make it well suited for entertainment or content creation, particularly considering the potentially excellent image quality offered by the OLED display technology.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Samsung's latest mobile display can both fold and slide" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/585df2f0-8b50-11ed-bdfa-59c204a60d67" style="height: 570; width: 820;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung Display</div></figure><p>The extra two inches of screen appears to roll from under the right-hand side of the device when slid out, judging by the extra thickness on that side of the display. The combined technology could effectively allow you to carry a 12.4-inch, 16:10 OLED tablet in a jacket pocket — ideal for entertainment or working on the go.</p><p>Two other Samsung displays will make their public debuts at CES 2023. The Flex Slidable Solo expands from a 14-inch OLED panel to a wider 17.3-inch display by sliding open from one side. And the Flex Slidable Duet OLED extends from two sides to make the same conversion. Both panels were featured at <a href="https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/2022/09/28/business/tech/Korea-display-Samsung-Display/20220928183918220.html">Intel's Innovation 2022</a> event in September, but have yet to be shown in public.&nbsp;</p>

## Arlo will stop supporting some of its older security cameras starting in April

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/arlo-security-system-ces-2022-201256180.html">Arlo's</a> older security cameras will lose access to future updates and some perks users have been enjoying these past years, now that the company has started implementing a new end-of-life policy for its products. As users <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/arlo/comments/1007fx1/arlo_endoflife_policy/">reported on Reddit</a> (via <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/01/02/arlo-end-of-life-policy/"><em>9to5Google</em></a>), the company has sent out emails to announce the new policy and the first products to be affected: the Generation 3 (VMC3030) and Pro (VMC4030) cameras, which were released in 2014 and 2016, respectively. The two models will lose access to the seven free days of cloud storage Arlo bundles with its cameras starting on April 1st, 2023. They'll also be the first models to stop receiving firmware and security updates, as well as bug fixes.&nbsp;</p><p>In its <a href="https://downloads.arlo.com/images/PDFs/EOL_Policy/Arlo_End-of-Life-Policy-2022.pdf">full announcement</a> (PDF) for the policy, Arlo explained that it will pull its cameras four years after the last time they were mass produced. Following the first two models above, the next Arlo cameras to lose access to updates and features include the Arlo Baby (ABC1000), Pro 2 (VMC4030P), Q (VMC3040) and Q+ (VMC3040S). Their end-of-life date is on January 1st, 2024. The company will also stop supporting Arlo Lights (ALS1101) and Audio Doorbell (AAD1001) on the same date.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To note, users don't have to throw them out as soon as those dates arrive. They can continue using the cameras to access livestreamed videos, as well as video clips stored locally with compatible Arlo base stations. But they'll have to pay for Arlo's Secure subscription service to have access to cloud storage, and the cameras will likely lose features over time since they'll no longer get firmware upgrades.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to putting an EOL date on its products, Arlo is also phasing out its email notifications and E911 emergency calling service on April 1st, as well as its Legacy Video Storage on AWS S3 on January 1st, 2024. The company said it will provide a 30-day advance notice for products that will be affected by the EOL rule, though, so people can decide whether to buy newer devices or to continue using their old ones.&nbsp;</p>

## Samsung's 2023 QD-OLED TVs will reach up to 2,000 nits of peak brightness

<p>Samsung launched its QD-OLED TV lineup <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-qd-oled-215038108.html">last year at CES</a> promising higher brightness than other OLED TVs, particularly its arch-rival LG. However, it was only mildly brighter than LG OLEDs back then, and yesterday, LG unveiled its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-2023-oled-tv-lineup-specs-010035157.html">2023 OLED TV lineup</a> with up to 70 percent more brightness and peak levels <a href="https://www.techgoing.com/lgs-g3-series-oled-tv-will-be-released-soon-brightness-increased-by-70-and-support-hdmi-2-1-qms">reportedly</a> hitting around 1,800 nits.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, Samsung Display has <a href="https://global.samsungdisplay.com/31057">announced</a> that its 2023 QD-OLED TV lineup will hit up to 2,000 nits of peak brightness, possibly pipping LG and approaching Mini-LED TVs, if accurate. That's thanks to a new QD-OLED Panel from Samsung Display, which uses a new &quot;HyperEfficient EL&quot; OLED material and Samsung's IntelliSense AI. The TVs will also be more energy efficient and offer more accurate colors, according to Samsung Display.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The new TVs will also be available in a wider range of sizes. Where the 2022 S95B came in just 55- and 65-inch sizes, you'll be able to purchase 49-, 55-, 65- and 77-inch TVs this year. The company hasn't announced other features, but you can expect to see Tizen OS, HDR10+ (and likely not Dolby Vision, once again), along with Bixby, Alexa and SmartThings. Pricing and availability haven't been revealed either, but we should learn more at CES 2023 in the coming days.</p>

<p>It's no surprise that LG is refreshing its OLED TV lineup for 2023, but you might appreciate this year's upgrade if your set lives in a well-lit room.

The chip is similarly key to AI audio processing that delivers 9.1.2-channel surround sound from the built-in speakers.

The 2023 OLED TVs come with a webOS 23 platform that requires much less scrolling, with just two pages of apps content. You'll also see fewer categories, and &quot;quick cards&quot; help you dive into categories like music and sports. Personal profiles, customizable quick settings and AI-based search keyword recommendations tailor the experience to your tastes, while <a href="https://www.engadget.com/matter-smart-home-standard-released-160059101.html">Matter support</a> should help your set play well with compatible smart home devices.</p><p>The range will seem familiar in some ways, although there are a few other notable upgrades. The Z3 remains the flagship with 77- and 88-inch 8K screens, but the G3 is now a better fit for wall-mounting thanks to a zero-gap design. It's available in sizes ranging from 55 inches to a huge 97 inches, although you'll only see the 70 percent brightness hike on 55-, 65- and 77-inch variants. The sweet-spot C3 line (pictured at middle) runs between 42 inches and 83 inches, although you'll have to 'settle' for the standard brightness booster.</p><p>Significantly, there's no more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-2022-oled-tv-pricing-availability-155043661.html">A series</a>. LG now considers the B3 series its entry-level OLED offering, and pitches it as ideal for gamers watching their money. You'll have to make do with the lesser a7 Gen 6 chip and go without brightness boosting, but you will get 4K at 120Hz (useful with the latest consoles) and your choice of 55-, 65- and 77-inch panels.</p><p>As is often the case with LG introductions, you'll have to wait for pricing and availability for the 2023 OLED TV selection. There's no doubt the G3 is the star attraction, though. Outside of that model's brightness boost and gapless mounting, these are largely iterative upgrades that will mostly prove appealing if you're replacing an aging set.</p>
