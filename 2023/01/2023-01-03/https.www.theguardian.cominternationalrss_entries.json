After a round of new year prediction punditry that made one think that 2023 could only be bleaker and weaker than 2022, the FTSE 100 index charged off in the opposite direction. It was up 180 points after two hours of trading to a shade over 7,600, enough to bring the all-time high (7,877, in the faraway pre-Ukraine, pre-Covid days of 2018) into view, a prospect that did not feature heavily in most \u201cwhat to expect\u201d checklists.</p><p>By the close, the gain was a more modest 102 points but still out of tune with the general diagnosis that a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/02/third-of-world-economy-to-hit-recession-in-2023-imf-head-warns\"> third of the world would be in recession this year</a> (the IMF) and that the UK\u2019s downturn was likely to be <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/81fbdff6-dacb-476b-a4ba-12696e7f7800\">the worst and longest in the G7</a> (a Financial Times poll of 101 UK economists).

Despite being the world\u2019s second-largest public company by market capitalisation, it got left out of the snappy acronym for the big five \u2013 FAANG \u2013 alongside Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google, in favour of Netflix, a company seven percent its size. Even when you add them to the equation (and GAFAM seems the most popular ordering, though given Google and Facebook\u2019s rebrands to Alphabet and Meta, it should really be MAMAA), Microsoft has avoided the scrutiny its peers have been subjected to.</p><p>Part of that is to do with where the companies make their profits. Microsoft\u2019s consumer brands are large and popular, but don\u2019t feel like unstoppable behemoths compared to the rest of the MAMAAs. Amazon towers over e-commerce; Meta owns social networking; Alphabet dominates web browsers, email, and search; while Apple practically prints money with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/10/iphone-14-review-apple-price-design\">a phone</a> that can credibly be called the most successful consumer product ever released. Microsoft, though, makes its money through enterprise sales and cloud computing, and its unbroken power over desktop operating systems seems like a relic of the past rather than a meaningful focus of attention in the present.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jan/03/why-a-67bn-takeover-could-make-microsoft-a-gaming-behemoth\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/03/brexit-northern-ireland-protocol-too-strict-says-leo-varadkar", "title": "Brexit: Northern Ireland protocol \u2018perhaps a bit too strict\u2019, says Varadkar", "date_published": "2023-01-03 11:48:40+00:00", "description": "<p>Irish PM says he understands unionists\u2019 concerns and he will be \u2018flexible and reasonable\u2019 on matter</p><p>The Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, has said mistakes were made on all sides in the handling of Brexit, vowing to be \u201cflexible and reasonable\u201d when attempting to solve issues with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/09/what-is-the-northern-ireland-protocol-explained-brexit\">Northern Ireland protocol</a>.</p><p>\u201cOne thing I have said in the past is that, when we designed the protocol, when it was originally negotiated, perhaps it was a little bit too strict,\u201d the taoiseach said, speaking in Dublin.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/03/brexit-northern-ireland-protocol-too-strict-says-leo-varadkar\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/03/john-kerry-rich-countries-must-respond-to-developing-world-anger-over-climate", "title": "John Kerry: rich countries must respond to developing world anger over climate", "date_published": "2023-01-03 11:23:10+00:00", "description": "<p>US climate envoy says there needs to be work on details of \u2018loss and damage\u2019 fund in 2023</p><p>People in developing countries are feeling increasingly angry and \u201cvictimised\u201d by the climate crisis, the US climate envoy John Kerry has warned, and rich countries must respond urgently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been chronicling the increased frustration and anger of island states and vulnerable countries and small African nations and others around the world that feel victimised by the fact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/nov/07/us-uk-fall-billions-short-climate-funding-cop27\">they are a minuscule component of emissions</a>,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd yet [they are] paying a very high price.

The latter group either prefer a short amount of penetration with less chance of discomfort or irritation \u2013 or no penetration at all. This is especially understandable for women, since female pleasure and the means to orgasm are best achieved via direct stimulation of the clitoris, which is located outside the vagina. Early ejaculation is a treatable issue, but try not to stress about it. Being anxious about your \u201cperformance\u201d will only exacerbate the situation. Instead, work on improving your ability to please your partner with skills that do not involve your penis, such as oral and manual stimulation. There are many highly erotic, non-penetrative techniques and it\u2019s time you stopped worrying about how your penis performs and think about what else would directly please your partner. Combine good communication skills with your personal seductive style to elicit information about his or her preferences, and practice sharing what you need with them.
