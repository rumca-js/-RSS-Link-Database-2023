"date_published": "2023-01-03 15:52:43+00:00", "description": "<p>This is an update to my previous post https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34189717 . Stripe has resolved the issue and everything has been released. I told the contacts at Stripe that I would do a write up about what happened from my point of view to help them understand what happened to me. I figured it would be good to do that write up publicly to help both Stripe and potential Stripe customers understand what happened and how it was resolved.<p>Summary: Stripe put my accounts in review for a spike in sales on Cyber Monday. Throughout the month we received very little communication from Stripe and had many support chats and calls. Keep in mind that the whole time Stripe was still accepting payments on our behalf on all of these accounts. Each of the chats/calls asked us to upload the same invoices each time for review and gave us vague information that our accounts were being reviewed. Finally out of frustration I posted on HN about my issue. Thanks to @dang for getting a Stripe employee to respond and he was finally able to resolve the issue for me.<p>Overall this review process was pretty bad. Very little communication and nothing I could really do directly to move things along or get any real information. It took a random Stripe employee to get an email from @dang and post on HN in order to get this issue resolved. I\u2019m lucky because I know about HN and know that Stripe employees frequent the site, but I don\u2019t think HN wants to become the Stripe support forum.<p>Stripe you can do better. We all know that in order to scale you need to automate pieces of your infrastructure and communication. But, there is a balance between automation and manual review. When someone like me gets caught up in an automated system there needs to be better ways of letting support help that person.<p>See my comments below for actual details and dates.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34233011\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34233011</a></p>\n<p>Points: 194</p>\n<p># Comments: 58</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://detangle.ai", "title": "Detangle: tl;dr your legal docs with AI", "date_published": "2023-01-03 15:39:03+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://detangle.ai\">https://detangle.ai</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34232795\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34232795</a></p>\n<p>Points: 10</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06557", "title": "Bertrand Meyer et al.: The concept of class invariant in OO programming", "date_published": "2023-01-03 15:35:33+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06557\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06557</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34232732\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34232732</a></p>\n<p>Points: 16</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://time.com/4504004/men-without-work/", "title": "Men Without Work (2016)", "date_published": "2023-01-03 14:51:02+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://time.com/4504004/men-without-work/\">https://time.com/4504004/men-without-work/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34232037\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34232037</a></p>\n<p>Points: 87</p>\n<p># Comments: 183</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_Without_Work_(book)", "title": "Men Without Work: America's Invisible Crisis (Book)", "date_published": "2023-01-03 14:51:02+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_Without_Work_(book)\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_Without_Work_(book)</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34232037\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34232037</a></p>\n<p>Points: 36</p>\n<p># Comments: 19</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34231879", "title": "Ask HN: Should I accept all cookies?

On iOS I'm using Firefox Focus most of the time with the occasional Safari window in Private Browsing mode (which has a similar behaviour to temporary containers plugin, all tabs are completely isolated).<p>On desktop ublock origin hides all cookie popups (thus not accepting anything) but on iOS I've been going through their hoops of going into advanced mode, toggling everything off and 'confirm my choices'. I've been doing this on principle only because the average lifetime of a tab (session) is only a few minutes so all cookies would be deleted anyway.<p>But recently I was wondering - have I been doing it wrong all along?<p>I'm not sure how cookie tracking works these days as last time I dealt with them server side was back in the PHP3 days but if my understanding is correct, accepting cookies means that the data brokers would have to keep a few bytes (cookie id) in their database for at least a short while hoping that I'd return.<p>So - would I pollute (and take a tiny bit of disk space) the data brokers by accepting their cookies and clearing the session afterwards instead of refusing the cookies?<p>Thanks.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34231879\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34231879</a></p>\n<p>Points: 10</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://10xeditor.com/", "title": "10x C++ Editor", "date_published": "2023-01-03 14:33:08+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://10xeditor.com/\">https://10xeditor.com/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34231770\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34231770</a></p>\n<p>Points: 44</p>\n<p># Comments: 10</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/03/health/psychedelic-drugs-mushrooms-oregon.html", "title": "Legal Use of Hallucinogenic Mushrooms Begins in Oregon", "date_published": "2023-01-03 14:28:37+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/03/health/psychedelic-drugs-mushrooms-oregon.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/03/health/psychedelic-drugs-mushrooms-oregon.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34231714\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34231714</a></p>\n<p>Points: 7</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/p/in-2022-web3-went-just-great", "title": "In 2022, Web3 went just great", "date_published": "2023-01-03 14:25:55+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/p/in-2022-web3-went-just-great\">https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/p/in-2022-web3-went-just-great</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34231687\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34231687</a></p>\n<p>Points: 41</p>\n<p># Comments: 23</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.learngpt.com/prompts/please-write-a-breaking-news-article-about-a-leaf", "title": "Please write a breaking news article about a leaf falling from a tree", "date_published": "2023-01-03 14:21:53+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.learngpt.com/prompts/please-write-a-breaking-news-article-about-a-leaf\">https://www.learngpt.com/prompts/please-write-a-breaking-news-article-about-a-leaf</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34231634\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34231634</a></p>\n<p>Points: 46</p>\n<p># Comments: 10</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34231553", "title": "Tell HN: GitHub is partially blocked in India", "date_published": "2023-01-03 14:15:37+00:00", "description": "<p>GitHub is being partially blocked in India by a prominent ISP (ACT) across multiple states under a sealed court order.<p>You can find multiple reports here: https://twitter.com/search?q=Github%20%40actfibernet.
