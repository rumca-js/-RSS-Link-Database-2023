Today, Nvidia announced a new AI upscaling tool at the CES 2023 GeForce Beyond stream. It&rsquo;s called the RTX Video Super Resolution and it&rsquo;s designed to upscale 1080p videos to 4K on Chrome and Edge browsers. However, it only works on computers with RTX-40 series and RTX-30 series GPUs. To see a side-by-side comparison of the tool in action, check out the video below.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see in the video, the RTX Video Super Resolution tool cleans up any jagged bits, using the AI power of the tensor cores embedded in modern GeForce GPUs. It does this by removing blocky compression artifacts, which are large pixel blocks that cause distortion. It gives the input a good scrub down and then makes it bigger. The idea is to improve video quality on larger displays and make binging your favorite shows more pleasant to look at. However, this tool has zero impact on the games you play. It only affects the videos you stream from your browser. For games, you&rsquo;ll need to use DLSS (in titles that support it).  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, the only upscaling option appears to be 1080p to 4K. I&rsquo;m not sure about you, but I&rsquo;m pretty darn excited, as I&rsquo;m the kind of person that regularly streams video from my PC. The bump in video quality is a huge plus, especially in my household. Nvidia&rsquo;s AI tool will become available this February. To see all the cool new hardware Nvidia revealed at CES 2023, including the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti and the first-ever RTX 4090 laptops, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1445469/nvidia-unleashes-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-rtx-40-series-laptops-and-more.html\">head right on over here</a>.</p>\n\nGraphics Cards</div>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1445676/buying-a-pc-with-an-intel-cpu-it-may-soon-cost-more.html", "title": "Buying a PC with an Intel CPU?

That included Intel processors&mdash;a shocking occurrence, given how steadfastly Intel resisted price cuts in the past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the good times may be on their way out. As reported by Tom&rsquo;s Hardware, Intel has quietly raised the suggested prices of its <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/548999/12th-gen-core-i9-12900k-review-intel-is-back.html\">12th-generation Alder Lake chips</a>. You&rsquo;ll see a 10 percent hike across the listings on Intel&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://ark.intel.com&amp;xcust=2-1-1445676-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ark product database</a>, with more affordable non-K class CPUs hit as equally as their overclockable K-class counterparts. The increase also affects F-class processors with no integrated graphics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In concrete terms, Intel now recommends a $648 starting MSRP for the flagship Core i9-12900K, up from $589. Popular chips such as the Core i7-12700K, 12600K, and 12400 start at $450, $318, and $211, respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-half-width is-float-right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"the-best-high-end-cpu-for-gaming\">\n\t\t\t\t\tthe best high-end cpu for gaming\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"core-i9-13900k\">Core i9-13900K</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Core i9-13900K\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/070A9689_V31.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"2000\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>With these changes, it&rsquo;s cheaper to buy <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1357979/intel-core-i9-13900k-review.html\">13th-gen Raptor Lake parts</a> than Alder Lake&mdash;on paper, at least. Street prices for Alder Lake are still below their launch MSRPs, with the 12900K sitting at a dramatically low $409. Meanwhile, the 13900K is $599, or right at the higher end of its suggested price range. If you&rsquo;re looking to buy or upgrade now, you can still take advantage of these lower costs. For the moment, anyway. Prices will likely shift eventually, especially given Intel&rsquo;s warning last year that <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/823871/intel-confirms-it-will-raise-prices-and-has-killed-optane.html\">it would raise CPU prices</a>. How fast you&rsquo;ll see that in stores remains to be seen&mdash;as well as how much it&rsquo;ll affect the remainder of the Raptor Lake lineup, as only four processors launched during the October debut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, Intel keeps its edge in product recommendations (<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/401980/best-cpus-for-gaming.html\">including our own</a>) for most people, thanks to strong performance from both Alder Lake and Raptor Lake.

The company&rsquo;s new GeForce RTX 40-series graphics are coming to laptops&mdash;including the flagship RTX 4090, for the first time ever&mdash;as well as the company&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/630335/geforce-now-review.html\">GeForce Now service</a>, and surprise!

The presentation didn&rsquo;t call explicit attention to the fact, but <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-accidentally-confirms-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-gpu-specifications&amp;xcust=2-1-1445469-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nvidia France accidentally confirmed</a> the RTX 4070 Ti is the new name for <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1354391/nvidia-cancels-the-controversial-rtx-4080-12gb.html\">Nvidia&rsquo;s controversial &ldquo;unlaunched&rdquo; RTX 4080 12GB</a>, which will now cost $799 instead of the $899 originally intended when it was called a 4080. That&rsquo;s still $200 more than the last-gen 3070 Ti and $100 more than the higher-tier RTX 3080 debuted at, so <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1379747/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-tested-5-things.html\">Nvidia&rsquo;s terrible RTX 40-series pricing</a> continues unabated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shaving the extra $100 off helps a bit but at first blush, it still seems like very poor value indeed&mdash;and its existence makes the RTX 4080&rsquo;s $1,200 sticker price even more egregious. Is the RTX 4080 really worth $400 more than the 4070 Ti and $500 more than the RTX 3080?</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Nvidia CES 2023 \" class=\"wp-image-1445481\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-perf-claim.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>Note that all of these games support DLSS 3, so you are unlikely to see this sort of performance gains over the 3090 Ti in titles that don&rsquo;t actively support the cutting-edge feature.</p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Nvidia</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay tuned for GeForce RTX 4070 Ti reviews to find out. With a street date of January 5, you shouldn&rsquo;t be waiting long. Nvidia claims the new GPU will outpunch the last-gen RTX 3090 Ti flagship and if that&rsquo;s true, it&rsquo;ll be a beast of a graphics card no matter what its price is. Whether it&rsquo;s worth the cost remains an open question given Nvidia&rsquo;s recent track record.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"rtx-40-series-laptops\">RTX 40-series laptops</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Nvidia CES 2023 \" class=\"wp-image-1445482\" height=\"686\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/nvidia-rtx-40-laptops-perf.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Nvidia</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The RTX 40-series is also coming to laptops. This is a <em>very</em> welcome announcement if mobile pricing winds up being less insane than the desktop GPUs. Nvidia claims this is the biggest leap in generational performance ever while running much more efficiently than before. And, for the first time ever, this generation&rsquo;s laptop lineup is spearheaded by Nvidia&rsquo;s ferocious xx90-class&mdash;previous flagships drew too much power for consideration in notebooks and topped out with xx80-class GPUs instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nvidia calls these a &ldquo;new class of laptops.&rdquo; The company also claims &ldquo;GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs&nbsp;will be featured in over 170 laptops from all of the major manufacturers.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Nvidia CES 2023 \" class=\"wp-image-1445485\" height=\"672\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/nvidia-rtx-40-laptops-max-q.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Nvidia</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>New Max-Q technologies help drive those advances, though they also make direct comparisons to previous Nvidia laptop GPUs difficult. DLSS 3 Frame Gen is now considered a Max-Q technology and while its combination of AI-generated frames and DLSS upscaling can definitely supercharge performance, using that technology (as Nvidia likely did for its performance claims) is definitely different than native rendering. Tri-speed memory and ultra-low power GDDR6 memory in the Max-Q arsenal also helps, but we&rsquo;ll need to see reviews before we can truly understand where performance falls.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Nvidia CES 2023 \" class=\"wp-image-1445483\" height=\"674\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Nvidia-rtx-4090-4080-laptops.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Nvidia</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 for laptops unlock the ability for surround 4K gaming at 60 frames-per-second&mdash;gaming with three 4K displays arrayed around you. A bit of a weird flex for laptops, but you love to see the power. Nvidia didn&rsquo;t provide many hard metrics but said creators can also expect to see 2x faster video exports (are Lovelace&rsquo;s dual AV1 encoders also in the mobile version?). Look for RTX 4080 and 4090 laptops to hit the streets on February 8 with prices starting at $1,999.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Nvidia CES 2023 \" class=\"wp-image-1445488\" height=\"680\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Nvidia-rtx-4050-4060-4070-laptops.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Nvidia</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Those are likely to be found exclusively in high-end creator and gaming laptops, though. For the rest of us, there&rsquo;s the RTX 4050, 4060, and 4070 for laptops&mdash;yes, even though we&rsquo;ve yet to see any of those GPUs in desktop form. Nvidia says that they&rsquo;ll deliver better-than-RTX 3080 mobile performance at a third of the power (given DLSS 3&rsquo;s inclusion, take that with a big grain of salt). Nvidia says at least some of these laptops will target 80fps 1440p gaming and will be available on February 22 starting at $999. That could represent an increase in price, however. The RTX 30-series mobile lineup started at $999 with the RTX 3060, whereas this new lineup starts at $999 with the lower-tier RTX 4050.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"rtx-4080-on-geforce-now\">RTX 4080 on GeForce Now</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Nvidia CES 2023 \" class=\"wp-image-1445489\" height=\"671\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Nvidia-rtx-4080-geforce-now.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Nvidia</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Nvidia also announced that the RTX 4080 is coming to its GeForce Now streaming service via a new &ldquo;Ultimate&rdquo; tier that replaces the previous RTX 3080 tier at the same $19.99/mo. price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nvidia claims the new RTX 4080 server pods deliver 5x the teraflops of an Xbox Series X and a new competitive 240Hz mode will help deliver ultra-low latency that&rsquo;s roughly twice as responsive as what you get with console gaming. You also get those juicy DLSS 3 capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>GeForce Now&rsquo;s RTX 4080 capabilities will start firing up in select North American and European data centers sometime in January, with a wider release planned for later this quarter.

If you&rsquo;re not sure what the heck a Chromebox is, listen up. In a nutshell, it&rsquo;s a tiny computer that exclusively runs ChromeOS. It&rsquo;s like a Chromebook but without the display, keyboard, touchpad, or chassis. Traditionally, these itty-bitty machines are used where space is limited, like a classroom or a small office. You&rsquo;re probably wondering what kind of hardware Acer&rsquo;s latest offering is packing. Well, let&rsquo;s get into it then! </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"acer-chromebook-cx15\">Acer Chromebook CX15</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Acer Chromebox CX15\" class=\"wp-image-1440330\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Acer-Chromebox-CXI5-horizontal.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Acer</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Acer Chromebox CX15 features the latest 12th-gen Intel Core i7 processor. That means it&rsquo;s fast enough to handle everyday tasks like browsing the web, checking e-mail, creating presentations, and so on. Connectivity options include four USB 3.2 Type-A, two USB 4 Gen 3 Type-C, two HDMI 2.1, and one RJ45 Gigabit Ethernet. The wide array of connectivity options allows you to easily hook up to external peripherals like monitors, keyboards, mice, and so on. According to Acer, it also offers low power-consumption modes and efficient charging capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Chromebox comes with either ChromeOS or ChromeOS with Chrome Enterprise. The latter is designed for the IT crowd, as it unlocks fast deployment and management tools. There are also built-in security features and 24/7 IT admin support. They&rsquo;re two products with two separate SKU numbers, but the only difference is that one comes loaded with the Chrome Enterprise upgrade. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Acer Chromebook CX15 will become available in Q1 with a starting price of $289.99.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"acer-add-in-one-24\">Acer Add-In-One 24</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Acer Add-In-One\" class=\"wp-image-1440466\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Acer-Add-In-One-24-rear.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Acer</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Acer Add-In-One 24 is a monitor that works with the Acer Chromebox CX15.

Take Acer&rsquo;s long-running Predator series, for example. Later this year two new models, the X27U and X45, will bring OLED&rsquo;s vibrant colors and high refresh rate to two of the most popular 1440p resolution ranges. The monitors are (shocker) 27 inches and a 45-inch ultrawide, respectively. This announcement comes right before CES.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of the two, the X45 is certainly the more dramatic. It uses a 45-inch, 3440&times;1440 resolution panel &mdash; a fairly standard gaming res at a super-sized format. But even more eye-catching is the 800R curve, which is about as rounded as you can get before the thing is trying to tickle your ears. (Incidentally, that kind of super-round curve vertex probably isn&rsquo;t for everyone; Dell and Asus are offering similar monitors in less extreme curved formats.) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The OLED panel isn&rsquo;t quite up to graphic design standards with a 98.5 percent DCI-Pr color range, but its 240Hz refresh rate and .01ms response time should be more than enough for even the most intense gaming sessions. Peak brightness is 1,000 nits, and the display is compatible with AMD&rsquo;s FreeSync tech (but not Nvidia&rsquo;s hardware-based G-Sync) and it includes an integrated USB-C KVM switch for quickly hopping from laptop to desktop. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The X27U is a less bombastic design, a flat 27-inch 2560&times;1440 panel that should fit into more spaces and budgets. But its technology and connections are almost identical. Both monitors have incredibly slim bezels and a more sleek, tripod-style design for their monitor stands. The go on sale in Q2 2023 (that&rsquo;s sometime from April to June), though China will get them a little earlier. The Predator X27U will cost $1,099, while the X45 will break the bank at $1,699. </p>\n\nMonitors</div>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1441543/acers-stylish-new-aio-desktops-take-on-the-imac.html", "title": "Acer\u2019s stylish new AIO desktops take on the iMac", "date_published": "2023-01-03 17:00:00+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Say what you will about Macs, but you can&rsquo;t deny the universal appeal of Apple&rsquo;s design language. Recently, PC manufacturers have been hitting back with design highlights of their own. Case in point: the new Acer Aspire S series, a pair of all-in-one desktop designs that are clearly trying to take a bite out of the iMac&rsquo;s market share. They&rsquo;ll be showing up on store shelves later this year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Aspire S will come in 27-inch and 32-inch flavors, with a muted aluminum blue finish available in both sizes and the smaller machine also coming in a sort of goldish-bronze. The internal components are all shoved into the column-like stand, with I/O ports on the back and sides and a singular speaker sitting right above the base. The display panels are 1440p LCDs with super-slim bezels. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Acer Aspire S 27 desktop parts\" class=\"wp-image-1441587\" height=\"609\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/aspire-s-ports.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Acer</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the sleek lines of the hardware, the internals are nothing to sneeze at. The 27-inch version gets 12th-gen Intel Core i5 and i7 processors with Xe graphics, while the 32-inch version has room for a Core i7-13700 and Intel&rsquo;s new Arc discrete graphics. (Exactly which GPU it will use wasn&rsquo;t disclosed &mdash; presumably a laptop-style A-series.) Both machines come with Wi-Fi 6E as well as USB-C, dedicated Ethernet, and HDMI-in ports, so the desktops can also double as a conventional monitor for other PCs or game consoles. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The webcam is usually a sore spot for AIO designs, forcing users to plug in a more powerful camera for decent web conferencing. Acer&rsquo;s addressed this with a modular webcam that can attach and detach via POGO pins. 1440p resolution on the camera sensor, Windows Hello IR compatibility, and an add-on ring light should make it easy to look your best. If you&rsquo;d rather use your own equipment, just snap the camera off. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 27-inch Aspire S will be on sale later in January, starting at $1,200. The more powerful 32-inch version will be available sometime in the first quarter of 2023 starting at $1,700. </p>\n\nDesktop PCs</div>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444617/dells-new-gaming-laptops-offer-super-sized-screens-and-trendy-colors.html", "title": "Dell\u2019s new gaming laptops offer super-sized screens and trendy colors", "date_published": "2023-01-03 17:00:00+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite a few interesting moves like the new XPS 13 Plus, Dell tends to favor gentle revisions rather than sweeping redesigns. But with the latest revisions to its Alienware and G-series gaming laptops, Dell appears to be going a little bolder than it once did. In a pre-CES event, the company showed off its new hardware, some of which might catch your eye more than the usual Dell designs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>First up is the G-series. Dell&rsquo;s budget gaming line is known more for its prices than its style, but that might just change this year. The new G15 and G16 models come in bombastic colors that accentuate a new and sharply angular chassis, inspired by &rsquo;80s-style synthwave setups that are all the rage. The purple-teal combo is easily the most eye-catching, though more toned-down options are available if you want a laptop that can blend into a classroom or office. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Dell G15 laptop, purple\" class=\"wp-image-1444632\" height=\"710\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/download.png\" width=\"1024\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Dell</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The G15 comes with your choice of 15.6-inch 1080p panels, at either 120Hz and 250 nits of brightness or an upgraded 165Hz/300-nit option. Inside the chunky chassis are 13th-gen Core processors up to a 24-core i9-13900HX, combined with &ldquo;next-gen Nvidia GeForce RTX graphics&rdquo; (specific GPUs not enumerated). RAM goes up to 32GB of DDR5, while the M.2 SSDs top out at 2TB in the single 2230 slot. For ports you get a single HDMI 2.1, one USB-C with Display Port alt mode, three Type A ports, and full-sized ethernet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The G16 offers largely identical specifications with an upgraded 16-inch, 16:10 display. The base model bumps up to 165Hz with an upgraded 240Hz option, both at 300 nits. The larger model has an optional 86 watt-hour battery, and you can also trick it out with a Cherry MX ultra-low profile keyboard, if you&rsquo;re feeling ritzy. The G15 will start at $849, while the G16 will be quite a bump at $1499. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dell&rsquo;s Alienware refreshes include the X14, a new X16, M16, and a truly massive M18. The latter is definitely the most interesting of the new options, thanks to a massive 18-inch screen that hasn&rsquo;t been seen in laptop form factors for quite a while. That panel comes in 16:10, 2560&times;1600, 165Hz for the base model, or if you&rsquo;re feeling the need for speed, a 1080p variant with a blistering 480Hz refresh rate. The gigantic chassis of the M18 also allows it to be configured with four, count &rsquo;em, <em>four </em>M.2 SSDs, supporting a maximum of 9 terabytes of storage (two 4TB + two 512GB drives, in whatever RAID array you like). </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Dell Alienware M18 laptop\" class=\"wp-image-1444637\" height=\"924\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/DSC09835.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Dell&rsquo;s other big change to the line is a revised &ldquo;Element 31&rdquo; thermal system, integrating targetted cooling for the CPU and GPU. On the exterior this is especially notable on the bottom of the laptops, where a fully circular &ldquo;foot&rdquo; allows for ingress and egress of air at specific locations, creating more efficient and effective airflow while also offering super-stable footing. It&rsquo;s an interesting design tweak that makes a lot of sense, though it does depend on a table or other flat surface for optimum performance. Other notable touches include optional Cherry MX ULP keyboards and smaller, sleeker chargers made with gallium nitride (GaN). </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Dell Alienware bottom air intake design\" class=\"wp-image-1444639\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/DSC09860.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>The new  Alienware designs include a unique all-around &ldquo;foot&rdquo; that regulates airflow and adds stability.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><br />All of the new Alienware machines offer a maximum Core i9-13900HX processor, except the sleek and small X14, which tops out at an i7-13620H. The M models max out at 64GB of DDR5 RAM (user-replaceable to boot!), while X models will have to make do with 32GB. The X14 offers RTX 3050, 4050, and 4060 GPUs, while the rest of the line can be configured with more powerful cards, up to an RTX 4090 with 16GB. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Dell Alienware M18\" class=\"wp-image-1444643\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/DSC09893.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>The massive Alienware M18 offers a huge selection of ports.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Alienware M16 and M18 laptops will launch at the tail end of winter starting at $1,899 and $2,099, respectively. The X14 and X16 will start at $1,799 and $2,149. You might have to wait for the cheaper options&mdash;all of them except the X14 will launch exclusively in high-end configurations to start. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Dell Alienware 500Hz monitor\" class=\"wp-image-1444644\" height=\"552\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/download-1.png\" width=\"1024\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Dell</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Alienware is also launching an insanely fast gaming monitor: the AW2524H. This 25-inch panel doesn&rsquo;t look like much, though we&rsquo;re told the hexagonal base was made specifically with e-sports pros and their non-standard desk setups in mind. But its 25-inch, 1080p IPS panel is an absolutely blistering 500Hz, assuming you&rsquo;re okay with a slight overclock. It&rsquo;s no slouch in brightness either at 400 nits (not bad for IPS), though it might not be pushing that at its maximum speed. The monitor is scheduled to launch in the first quarter of 2023, at a price yet to be determined. </p>\n\nGaming Laptops</div>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1445295/this-luxurious-mechanical-keyboard-is-39-off.html", "title": "Save 39% on this wireless Cooler Master mechanical keyboard", "date_published": "2023-01-03 15:47:50+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>When I was hunting for juicy deals in the wee hours of the morning, this stark white mechanical keyboard stopped me in my tracks. The minimalist aesthetic is clean, modern, and just plain drop-dead gorgeous. If you&rsquo;re looking to add a more modern flair to your workspace, then you should check out the Cooler Master SK622 wireless mechanical keyboard.

The 60% layout means that it&rsquo;s a smaller keyboard and is more portable and lightweight as a result. The blue switches should deliver a satisfying clickity-clack typing experience. It also connects via Bluetooth 4.0 and is compatible with MacOS and Windows. This is a killer deal, so don&rsquo;t miss out.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"cta wp-block wp-block-button\"><a class=\"cta__btn\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LX76NKR?th=1&amp;xcust=2-1-1445295-7-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Get the Cooler Master SK622 mechanical keyboard for $76.29 at Amazon</a></p>\nKeyboards</div>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1445207/samsungs-biggest-ultrawide-monitor-yet-will-bust-your-back-and-your-wallet.html", "title": "Samsung\u2019s 57-inch ultrawide monitor will bust your back and your wallet", "date_published": "2023-01-03 15:12:01+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s an arms race among PC monitors right now. And as has been its pattern for the last few years, Samsung&rsquo;s brought out the big guns. Its latest Odyssey Neo G95C monitor isn&rsquo;t just its most advanced offering, it&rsquo;s easily the biggest, stretching a massive 57 inches from curved corner to curved corner. The exercise in display excess pumps out a resolution of 7680&times;2160 &mdash; essentially two 4K screens side by side, on one panel. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s hard to overstate just how ridiculous this design is. While Samsung didn&rsquo;t share physical dimensions for this thing in its pre-CES announcement, the previous largest Neo G9 (CHG9, because Samsung&rsquo;s naming scheme is weird) was 49 inches diagonally, 47.36 inches wide, and 33.1 pounds (including the stand). Extrapolating a little, this bigger model will probably hang off the side of a four-foot-wide desk. With a dramatic 1000R curve factor, it might hang off the <em>front </em>of the desk, too! Good luck trying to find a VESA arm that can support it; you might just have to live with the included stand, which is more than half its width according to the photos. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 57 inch monitor\" class=\"wp-image-1445250\" height=\"942\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/CES-Monitor-Lineup_PR_dl6_Odyssey_Neo_G9.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Samsung</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&rsquo;s not just your desk and your back that will need to be beefy to handle this thing. Your graphics card will need the latest, greatest DisplayPort 2.1 connection to pump out double-4K resolution at the panel&rsquo;s maximum 240Hz refresh rate&mdash;a feature currently only offered by <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1431755/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-radeon-rx-7900-xt-review-rdna-3.html\">AMD&rsquo;s Radeon RX 7900 series GPUs</a>. Samsung claims it&rsquo;s using Display Stream Compression, a newer VESA standard, in order to get the image across without distortion. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re okay with sacrificing a little size for image quality, Samsung also announced a new OLED variant of the Odyssey range. The OLED G9 (G95SC) is &ldquo;just&rdquo; 49 inches wide with a less-dramatic 1800R curve rating, and a resolution of 5120&times;1440 &mdash; again, basically two 24-inch 1440p displays side by side. But that OLED panel, a first for Samsung&rsquo;s gaming line, makes this a horse of several million different colors. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Samsung 49 inch OLED G9 monitor\" class=\"wp-image-1445254\" height=\"556\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/CES-Monitor-Lineup_PR_dl3_Odyssey_OLED_G9.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Samsung</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Samsung claims a typical OLED 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio, or &ldquo;perfect blacks&rdquo; in layman&rsquo;s terms. A 240Hz refresh rate means this will tax your GPU almost as much as the larger screen, though it&rsquo;ll be a bit quicker on the draw with a 0.1ms response time. Samsung is packing in the same onboard software as its smart TVs, letting users access streaming apps like Netflix, YouTube, Xbox Game Pass streaming and GeForce Now without any additional hardware. I wonder how tricky it will be to find something to watch at that 32:9 aspect ratio. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As usual, Samsung didn&rsquo;t divulge launch dates or prices for either new display. Expect them sometime before the middle of 2023, and start saving now &mdash; I&rsquo;ll be shocked if either of these <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1439692/best-ultrawide-gaming-monitors.html\">ultrawide monitors</a> hits the market for under $2000. </p>\n\nMonitors</div>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/550968/best-laptop-deals-2023.html", "title": "Best laptop deals: Top picks from budget to extreme", "date_published": "2023-01-03 14:51:04+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>The holidays may be over over, but that doesn&rsquo;t mark the end of awesome laptop sales.

Buy laptops with Intel <strong>10</strong>-series Core chips or higher, such as the Core i5-<strong>10</strong>510U, or the Core i7-<strong>11</strong>800H (for even more details see our <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/397920/10th-gen-ice-lake-vs-comet-lake-cpu-buyers-guide.html\">Intel 10th-gen mobile CPU buying guide</a>); or go with an AMD Ryzen processor (but <em>not</em> an AMD Athlon or A-series chip). Avoid laptops with Pentium or Celeron processors unless it&rsquo;s a Chromebook (running Chrome OS). You&rsquo;re going to need to pay attention with gaming laptops, too, as some GPUs, like the RTX 3050 Ti, don&rsquo;t offer much boost over their RTX 2xxx-series cousins, and Nvidia has dropped the Max-Q designation on certain low-power options. Our <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/551001/buying-a-laptop-look-for-pcs-with-these-cpus-and-gpus.html\">laptop CPU and GPU cheat sheet</a> can help you shop smart. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Display resolution is a gotcha. If you see a laptop labeled as &ldquo;HD&rdquo; resolution that means 1366-by-768 and often isn&rsquo;t worth your time for a laptop under 13 inches unless the deal is absolutely standout. What you want is &ldquo;Full HD&rdquo; or &ldquo;FHD,&rdquo; which means 1080p. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&rsquo;t buy <em>laptops</em> with under 4GB of RAM or 128GB of SSD storage&mdash;though on a Chromebook, this configuration is acceptable. We have more explanation in our <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/402141/chromebooks-versus-windows-laptops-which-should-you-buy.html\">laptops versus Chromebooks buying guide</a>, as well as in our primer on <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/549407/how-to-buy-a-budget-laptop-without-getting-screwed.html\">how to buy a budget laptop without getting screwed</a>. Also watch out for eMMC storage, which is something we don&rsquo;t recommend for a Windows laptop but works fine for a Chromebook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reviews can be helpful. Even if you can&rsquo;t find a review of a specific configuration, try related models. They&rsquo;ll often give you a good idea of the build quality and performance. Also buy from brands you trust. Amazon&rsquo;s daily laptop deals right now are full of brands we&rsquo;ve never tested or talked to (Broage, Teclast, DaySky, Jumper) and it&rsquo;s just a good idea to be wary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most older laptops will run Windows 10, and that&rsquo;s fine&mdash;there&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/539089/why-we-recommend-you-skip-windows-11-for-now.html\">no rush to upgrade</a>.

What&rsquo;s new? What Intel calls &ldquo;endurance gaming&rdquo; and a new Movidius VPU &ldquo;AI card&rdquo; for laptops, which sounds conceptually like the standalone sound accelerators of a couple decades ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intel said it expects more than 60 HX-based gaming laptops, with over 250 different laptop models built around the remaining mobile processors. These and other 13th-gen Raptor Lake laptops will ship &ldquo;later&rdquo; during the first quarter 2023, executives said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intel also fleshed out its Raptor Lake desktop lineup, after originally <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1073245/intel-13th-gen-core-cpus-raptor-lake-reveal.html\">announcing the Core i9-13900K processors</a> in late September. (We&rsquo;ve discussed these in a separate article.) Intel also made good on its promise to eliminate the Pentium and Celeron brands by announcing the Intel Core i3 N-series processors for $500 PCs. All desktop and mobile Raptor Lake chips use the &ldquo;Raptor Cove&rdquo; performance core design on the Intel 7 process, optimized for speed and with larger caches for improved performance and controlled by an enhanced Thread Director co-designed by Intel and Microsoft.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Intel 13th-gen Core Raptor Lake\" class=\"wp-image-1440649\" height=\"614\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Raptor-Lake-mobile-lineup.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Intel&rsquo;s 13th-gen mobile Core lineup, aka &ldquo;Raptor Lake.&rdquo;</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Intel</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Intel is launching its new processors in what is an extremely tumultuous market. Mercury Research reported that for every quarter in 2022, the mobile CPU market has recorded unit sales at least 30 percent less than 2021 as PC makers cut back on inventory. Intel, though, slurped up an additional 9.1 percentage points in the market, giving it an 84 percent share of the mobile PC processor market. In other words, if you do invest in a new laptop in 2023, you stand a greater chance than ever of finding one of these chips inside it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"intels-raptor-lake-hx-series-for-games-and-game-creators\">Intel&rsquo;s Raptor Lake-HX series, for games and game creators</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To be fair, you probably won&rsquo;t end up buying a Raptor Lake-HX notebook unless you&rsquo;re a creative professional who demands the very best. Intel <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/698329/intel-adds-ultrapremium-12th-gen-core-hx-processor-for-gaming-laptops.html\">launched the 12th-gen Alder Lake-HX chip</a> last May, and Intel said that that 16-core (eight performance, eight efficiency cores) platform was designed for &ldquo;professionals in the field who need low latency access to data.&rdquo; The new 13th-gen Raptor Lake-HX platform increases the core count to 24 (up to eight performance cores and 16 efficiency cores). But the HX series still only includes 32 graphics execution units (EUs).</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Intel 13th-gen Core Raptor Lake processors mobile\" class=\"wp-image-1444452\" height=\"668\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HX-speeds.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Intel&rsquo;s 13th-gen Core-HX family. Prices aren&rsquo;t listed for mobile processors as they&rsquo;re negotiated directly with PC makers.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Intel</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s a subtle but interesting difference between the 12th- and 13th-gen chips where gaming is concerned. Last spring, Daniel Rogers, senior director of mobile product marketing within Intel&rsquo;s Client Computing Division, described the older<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/607526/core-i9-12900hk-review-intel-alder-lake-laptops-crush-the-competition.html\"> Core i9-12900H<em>K</em></a> as the &ldquo;world&rsquo;s best gaming processor.&rdquo; Today, Intel is claiming that the more expensive Core i9-13950H<em>X</em> is the &ldquo;best gaming laptop platform.&rdquo; </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Intel 13th-gen Core Raptor Lake\" class=\"wp-image-1440647\" height=\"673\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/gaming.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Intel&rsquo;s gen-over-gen comparison between its 13th-gen HX platform and the prior generation.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Intel</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>What gives? Colin Helms, the market manager for the enthusiast mobile group, said that the Core i9-12900HK offered far more gaming platforms than the 12th-gen HX part. Today, it&rsquo;s the opposite. &ldquo;With 13th-gen, it really turns things around&hellip; We want to make sure we&rsquo;re telling the most honest story with our best platform,&rdquo; he said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laptops using 13th-gen HX chips will support DDR5-5600 (four DIMMs, two DIMMs per channel), a slight upgrade from the DDR5-4800 supported by the 12th-gen HX platform. Other than that, the chip looks largely unchanged from the previous generation: There&rsquo;s still support for PCI Express 5, with 16 lanes (either x16 or 2&times;8) hanging off the CPU, and support for two (discrete) Thunderbolt 4 controllers. Neither the DMI interface to the PCH nor the PCH itself has changed, so the HX still supports Killer Wi-Fi 6E, 14 USB-2/10 USB-3 ports, and more. Bluetooth support now includes Bluetooth LE, however, which allows the laptop&rsquo;s wireless radio to remain in sleep mode for far longer, at up to half the power.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Intel 13th-gen Core Raptor Lake\" class=\"wp-image-1440644\" height=\"618\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/HX-Platform.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Intel&rsquo;s 13th-gen Raptor Lake-HX platform.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Intel</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Intel is playing a little cagey with the HX performance, claiming that it&rsquo;s 11 percent faster on a per-thread basis and 49 percent faster across all threads&mdash;where the additional cores come into play. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, Intel is trying to thread the needle between content creation and gaming performance.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Intel 13th-gen Core Raptor Lake\" class=\"wp-image-1440652\" height=\"642\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Single-thread-multithread.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>The addition of more cores certainly helps the multicore comparisons to earlier chips.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Intel</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But Intel compared its latest chip to the Core i9-12900HK, not the Core i9-12900HX.

Our <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407493/best-gaming-laptops.html\">best gaming laptops</a>, for example, typically feature Intel&rsquo;s H-series chips. But that&rsquo;s a change: With Raptor Lake, Intel attached the &ldquo;best gaming processor&rdquo; to the HX family, specifically the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/607526/core-i9-12900hk-review-intel-alder-lake-laptops-crush-the-competition.html\">Core i9-12900HK</a>. Intel didn&rsquo;t even bother to publish any gaming benchmarks to back up the Core i9-13900HK.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two new, key features should interest you: &ldquo;endurance gaming,&rdquo; and the addition of what&rsquo;s known as a Movidius VPU&mdash;AI for Intel laptops, which we&rsquo;ll dive deeper into in a second.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&rsquo;ve included the key numbers for the Intel mobile families in the slides below, beginning with the H- and P-series, which will be included in higher-performance laptops.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-jetpack-image-compare\"><div class=\"juxtapose\"><img alt=\"Intel 13th-gen Core Raptor Lake processors mobile\" class=\"image-compare__image-before\" height=\"1441\" id=\"1444454\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/H-series-speeds.png\" width=\"2577\" /><img alt=\"Intel 13th-gen Core Raptor Lake processors mobile\" class=\"image-compare__image-after\" height=\"1425\" id=\"1444450\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/P-series-speeds.png\" width=\"2565\" /></div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, the new Raptor Lake chips look a lot like the 12th-gen Alder Lake processors: There are only up to 14 cores (six performance, eight efficiency) but with the 96 EUs for graphics that accompanied the 12th-gen Cores, too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you end up buying a Windows tablet (like one of Microsoft&rsquo;s Surface Pro series) you&rsquo;ll likely be buying one of the 13th-gen U-series mobile processors, below. There&rsquo;s a fairly steep dropoff in terms of performance cores (two performance cores, at most) but the longer battery life engendered by the lower 15W thermal design power is what PC makers will be eyeing.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Intel 13th-gen Core Raptor Lake processors mobile\" class=\"wp-image-1444453\" height=\"667\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/U-series-speeds.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Intel</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, laptops using the 13th-gen H-, P-, and U-series chip however will see improvements that include support for either DDR5-5200/DDR4-3200 memory, as well as low-power DDR5x-4600 and LPDDR4x-4267 memory. Like the 12th-gen chips, Wi-Fi 6E is integrated. Bluetooth Low Energy (Bluetooth LE) has been added, as with the HX platform. Eight lanes of PCI Express 5 have been added, too, but only on the H-series gaming platforms.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"Intel 13th-gen Core Raptor Lake\" class=\"wp-image-1440650\" height=\"667\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/HPU-platform.png?w=1200\" width=\"1199\" /><figcaption>Intel&rsquo;s H-, P-, and U-series chips will emphasize low-power DRAM as much as anything else.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Intel</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>One area that has received a small but significant upgrade is the integrated Thunderbolt 4 controller, which now supports the redefined <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1355415/displayport-2-1-announced-for-pcs.html\">DisplayPort 2.1</a> spec as well as USB 3.2. The latter&rsquo;s significant, since that standard allows for USB-C ports to run at 20Gbps via PCI Express, rather than the conventional 10Gbps. That will allow for faster external SSDs to be connected to 13th-gen Raptor Lake laptops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intel isn&rsquo;t saying much about the Core i9-13900HK processors, claiming that they&rsquo;ll be about 10 percent faster and more responsive than the Core i9-12900H.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Intel 13th-gen Core Raptor Lake\" class=\"wp-image-1440651\" height=\"670\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/HPU-Crossmark-benchmark.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Intel  isn&rsquo;t divulging much about its more mainstream 12th-gen chips at the moment.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Intel</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-intels-endurance-gaming\">What is Intel&rsquo;s endurance gaming?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Gaming laptops have a problem: Gaming on the go can suck power like mad, which can catastrophically reduce battery life. But gaming laptops are typically optimized for high performance, with high-refresh-rate screens. Intel has struck a compromise: &ldquo;endurance gaming,&rdquo; which can dial down the power that the laptop supplies to the processor&rsquo;s integrated graphics, allowing it to run for a longer period of time. Games like <em>League of Legends</em>, <em>Rocket League</em>, and <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em>, which normally run at about 90 minutes in performance mode, can run for 4.5 hours in &ldquo;endurance gaming&rdquo; mode, at 30 frames per second, executives said. The technology even prevents screen tearing, said Jacob Levine, a product engineer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Endurance gaming will be available on pretty much every Intel mobile Raptor Lake platform save the HX series, which uses discrete graphics, Helms said. The feature can be turned on via the Arc control utility, he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"the-movidius-vpu-is-intels-ai-card-for-pcs\">The Movidius VPU is Intel&rsquo;s AI card for PCs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Intel has said before that the (14th-gen?) <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1076150/intel-confirms-ai-improvements-will-come-in-meteor-lake.html\">Meteor Lake chip will include integrated AI</a>. &ldquo;Select&rdquo; 13th-gen laptops, however, will include a Movidius VPU discrete add-on card inside them, which will enable AI-powered features that had previously been reserved for Arm laptops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/416302/intel-buys-chip-maker-movidius-to-help-bring-computer-vision-to-drones.html\">buying Movidius in 2016</a>, Intel began <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/402099/movidius-windows-ml-intel-smart-pcs.html\">adapting the technology in 2018 to power Amazon Alexa</a> and visual processing units. Four years later, Movidius is a foundation of Intel&rsquo;s AI program. But it&rsquo;ll pave the way for future enhancement, too. For now, the discrete AI card will offload AI processing functions until Intel launches a dedicated AI chip inside of Meteor Lake.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Microsoft Surface Pro 9 (5G) webcam Windows Studio Effects blur\" class=\"wp-image-1360490\" height=\"579\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Standard-blur.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>AI  functions on laptops are currently handled by the CPU, such as to create background blur. But Qualcomm Snapdragon Arm chips have dedicated AI engines, and soon X86 laptops will as well.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially, Movidius today will power Microsoft&rsquo;s Windows Studio Effects, a Windows 11 suite of technologies that debuted in the Windows 11 2022 Update and the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1346280/microsofts-new-surface-pro-9-hides-an-arm-option-and-cool-features.html\">Arm-powered Microsoft Surface Pro 9</a>. Studio Effects include background-noise cancellation, a technology to recognize and focus the camera on your face, as well as an AI-powered illusion that will make it look like you&rsquo;re always looking at your webcam. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"more-evo-pcs-en-route\">More Evo PCs en route</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these improvements will show up on Intel Evo-branded laptops, the premium collaboration between Intel and engineers at third-party laptop makers. Over 15 manufacturers have enrolled in the program, with over 100 Evo designs to date, said Josh Newman, Intel&rsquo;s vice-president and general manager of product marketing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&rsquo;s new for Evo? An improved push into &ldquo;intelligent collaboration,&rdquo; with more of a push into improved cameras, audio, and Wi-Fi capabilities. Intel will also include its <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1076137/intels-connected-unison-app-could-save-consumer-hardware.html\">Unison app</a> on Evo laptops, which is its own spin on the Windows Your Phone / Phone Link software&mdash;but with connections to both Android <em>and</em> iPhones.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"alder-lake-n-intel-n-series-for-low-cost-pcs\">Alder Lake N / Intel N-series for low-cost PCs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Intel is also announcing a new processor for the low-cost PC and Chromebook market: two Core i3 N-series processors. The processors will use &ldquo;four cores with Intel processor&rdquo; and &ldquo;8 cores with Intel Core i3 N-series processor,&rdquo; with Intel&rsquo;s Gracemont cores factoring in somewhere&mdash;it&rsquo;s not clear where. Intel casually refers to this chip as &ldquo;Alder Lake-N.&rdquo; </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Intel 13th-gen Core Raptor Lake processors mobile\" class=\"wp-image-1444451\" height=\"668\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/N-series-speeds.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Intel&rsquo;s new Rapor Lake-N series desktop and mobile processors.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Intel</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Intel&rsquo;s new N-series processors will be used in over 50 designs, Intel executives said, and include the Core i3-N305 and -N300. Note that these chips will be used for both desktop as well as laptops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the platform&rsquo;s capabilities include Wi-Fi 6E, DisplayPort 1.4, HDMI 2.0, and a slew USB2 and USB3 ports hanging off PCI Express Gen 3. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The whole logic behind this architecture in this space is that people are shopping for PCs in these price bands: They don&rsquo;t need low cost, they need experiences,&rdquo; Newman said.</p>\n\nCPUs and Processors</div>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1440715/intel-announces-the-13th-gen-core-desktop-chips-youll-likely-buy.html", "title": "Intel\u2019s latest Core processors bring the 13th-gen to the masses", "date_published": "2023-01-03 14:00:00+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Intel added to their 13th-gen Core desktop processor lineup at CES 2023, with the announcement of the 65W family of desktop &ldquo;Raptor Lake&rdquo; processors for mainstream PCs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intel has already launched the enthusiast-focused Core i9-13900K and our <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1357979/intel-core-i9-13900k-review.html\">review of the chip</a> shows that it leads AMD&rsquo;s Ryzen chips on multiple fronts. But the 65W chips are more than likely what most consumers will buy as opposed to the $650 Core i9-13900K, especially since most prebuilt PCs don&rsquo;t include overclockable K-series chips.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intel&rsquo;s lineup will be led by the Core i9-13900, which will be slightly slower than the Core i9-13900K. The Core i9-13900 will run at 5.6GHz (versus 5.8GHz) and contain up to 24 cores (8 performance cores, and 16 efficiency cores) and 32 threads. If it&rsquo;s like the Core i9-13900K, it will include a larger level two cache (2MB per performance core and 4MB for every efficiency core cluster) that will help boost performance. It will top out at $549.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intel includes two different processor families, which we&rsquo;ve shown in the two slides below: the 35W T-series chips, optimized for small-form-factor and low-power builds, and the F-series, which does away with an integrated GPU to save a few dollars. Otherwise, the Intel Core i9-13900 i7-13700, and i5-13600 are the most powerful chips inside this family.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-jetpack-image-compare\"><div class=\"juxtapose\"><img alt=\"Intel 13th-gen Core Raptor Lake desktop processors\" class=\"image-compare__image-before\" height=\"1474\" id=\"1444447\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/speeds-2.png\" width=\"2605\" /><img alt=\"Intel 13th-gen Core Raptor Lake desktop processors\" class=\"image-compare__image-after\" height=\"1483\" id=\"1444446\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/speeds-1.png\" width=\"2623\" /></div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The selling point for all of the 13th-gen Core family is the addition of extra efficiency cores, which will help boost the chip&rsquo;s performance when the entire chip is taxed to its fullest. The Core i9 family will add eight more efficiency cores and up to 18MB more L2 cache. The Core i7 family (topping out at 5.2GHz in turbo mode) will add four more E-cores. The Core i5 family, meanwhile, will add eight more efficiency cores, for up to 39 percent more performance than the prior generation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a performance standpoint, Intel is saying that the new Core i9-13900 will deliver up to 11 percent single-threaded performance and 34 percent multi-threaded performance compared to the Core i9-12900K. It&rsquo;s also more energy-efficient, too. Intel claims that the Core i9-13900 will offer up to 34 percent higher multithreaded performance as the Core i9-12900 and at the same power level.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-jetpack-image-compare\"><div class=\"juxtapose\"><img alt=\"Intel 13th-gen desktop Core performance\" class=\"image-compare__image-before\" height=\"1593\" id=\"1440752\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Productivity-performance.png\" width=\"3057\" /><img alt=\"Intel 13th-gen desktop Core performance\" class=\"image-compare__image-after\" height=\"1558\" id=\"1440751\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/gaming-perf.png\" width=\"3039\" /></div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Intel said its partners plan up to 70 motherboards, with support for both DDR4 and DDR5 memory, to support its new desktop chips.</p>\n\nCPUs and Processors</div>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1443354/upgrade-your-cloud-storage-this-year-at-a-special-discount.html", "title": "Upgrade your cloud storage this year at a special discount", "date_published": "2023-01-03 08:00:00+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s that time of the year when we&rsquo;re&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/398773/how-to-file-your-taxes-for-free.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">auditing</a>&nbsp;everything in our lives, wondering if it&rsquo;s time to make changes.
