## Update: Stripe is holding over $400k of mine with no explanation
 - [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34233011](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34233011)

<p>This is an update to my previous post https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34189717 . Stripe has resolved the issue and everything has been released. I told the contacts at Stripe that I would do a write up about what happened from my point of view to help them understand what happened to me. I figured it would be good to do that write up publicly to help both Stripe and potential Stripe customers understand what happened and how it was resolved.<p>Summary: Stripe put my accounts in review for a spike in sales on Cyber Monday. Throughout the month we received very little communication from Stripe and had many support chats and calls. Keep in mind that the whole time Stripe was still accepting payments on our behalf on all of these accounts. Each of the chats/calls asked us to upload the same invoices each time for review and gave us vague information that our accounts were being reviewed. Finally out of frustration I posted on HN about my issue. Thanks to @dang for getting a Stripe employee to respond and he was finally able to resolve the issue for me.<p>Overall this review process was pretty bad. Very little communication and nothing I could really do directly to move things along or get any real information. It took a random Stripe employee to get an email from @dang and post on HN in order to get this issue resolved. I’m lucky because I know about HN and know that Stripe employees frequent the site, but I don’t think HN wants to become the Stripe support forum.<p>Stripe you can do better. We all know that in order to scale you need to automate pieces of your infrastructure and communication. But, there is a balance between automation and manual review. When someone like me gets caught up in an automated system there needs to be better ways of letting support help that person.<p>See my comments below for actual details and dates.</p>

## Ask HN: Should I accept all cookies? (and clear them shortly after?)

<p>Hi,<p>My browsing setup on desktop is Firefox with temporary containers, ublock origin and a few other plugins. On iOS I'm using Firefox Focus most of the time with the occasional Safari window in Private Browsing mode (which has a similar behaviour to temporary containers plugin, all tabs are completely isolated).<p>On desktop ublock origin hides all cookie popups (thus not accepting anything) but on iOS I've been going through their hoops of going into advanced mode, toggling everything off and 'confirm my choices'. I've been doing this on principle only because the average lifetime of a tab (session) is only a few minutes so all cookies would be deleted anyway.<p>But recently I was wondering - have I been doing it wrong all along?<p>I'm not sure how cookie tracking works these days as last time I dealt with them server side was back in the PHP3 days but if my understanding is correct, accepting cookies means that the data brokers would have to keep a few bytes (cookie id) in their database for at least a short while hoping that I'd return.<p>So - would I pollute (and take a tiny bit of disk space) the data brokers by accepting their cookies and clearing the session afterwards instead of refusing the cookies?<p>Thanks.</p>

## Tell HN: GitHub is partially blocked in India

<p>GitHub is being partially blocked in India by a prominent ISP (ACT) across multiple states under a sealed court order.<p>You can find multiple reports here: https://twitter.com/search?q=Github%20%40actfibernet. It has shown up in news reports: https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/github-content-domain-blocked-for-these-indian-users-reports/articleshow/96687992.cms<p>ACT is using SNI-sniffing to block raw.githubusercontent, unlike most other blocks, which are DNS based. ACT's block page claims it is under a court order to block the domain:<p>> curl http://raw.githubusercontent.com/<p>> This URL has been blocked under the instructions in compliance with the orders of a Hon'ble Court.<p>(Using HTTPS results in a dropped connection).<p>Unfortunately, there is no easy way to find out if there is even a court order behind this block. A few times court orders are leaked, and a court case to get a single order published took 3 years[0] . Other ISPs are known to block websites without court-order due to technical issues[1]<p>for the last few weeks, GitHub previews on the website have refused to load, alongside some other interesting cases, such as extension previews breaking on VS Code (, Obsidian etc).<p>Hopefully, GitHub is fighting a case to get this unblocked, and given the resources it has, to challenge the law here as well (the law gives no recourse as it stands).<p>[0]: https://internetfreedom.in/delhi-hc-directs-meity-to-provide-a-copy-of-the-blocking-order-and-a-post-decisional-hearing-to-mr-tanul-thakur-whattheblock/<p>[1]: https://github.com/captn3m0/hello-cloudflare/</p>

<p>What i see happening soon is:<p>With all this recent AI stuff where it is able to create content that feels real 
I started to think about how AI could just create the world for you.<p>Since we already are basically living in the internet we could have 
some terrorist organization finding an isolated enough person and attack him with a program
that would generate a bubble just for him: fake friends, fake events happening, fake influencers and news programs just for him, basically whole internet content
and then only reality check would be talking to other people (which Trump us taught is also not necessarily true "fake news" argument)
and then easily this person can be pushed towards some criminal or whatever activity.</p>

## Ask HN: Alternatives to Scratch for a blind child?

<p>Hey HN,<p>My friend’s children are starting their adventure with programming at school with Scratch. Unfortunately, the eldest one is blind, and as Scratch is visual, he won’t be able to use it. A pity: the kid has probably the most vivid imagination of all people I know.<p>Can you recommend an alternative? Something tactile or audial, perhaps? A quick googling yielded https://codejumper.com/ – is it worth the $1K it costs?<p>Personal experience reports are most welcome. Thanks!</p>
