<p>So, you’re <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/cms/article/2524405">ready to buy a new Windows computer</a> to replace that old laptop you’ve been using for years — the one with the worn-out keyboard and cracked monitor — and you’re trying to figure out where to get it. The short answer: it depends. Do you prefer to try out keyboards before you buy? Do you like to peruse technology in a store dedicated to one brand, or compare various computers side by side? Or maybe you prefer to compare options online and build exactly what you want.</p><p>With Windows 11 now offered on most systems, there are certain minimum specifications to keep in mind. The hard drive and RAM, for example, can be difficult to upgrade later on — especially on some laptops. These days, with the ability to move data online or onto USB flash drives, getting a larger main drive isn’t as critical as it used to be. I rarely see Windows laptops sold now with less than 256GB of storage, but that may be enough for most users. And typically, to support Windows 11’s <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/minimum/supported/windows-11-supported-intel-processors" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">minimum processor requirements</a>, you’ll need an Intel Core i7 or Core i9 processor.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3684273/its-2023-time-for-new-windows-hardware.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>So you're back to work after the long holiday break? As we dive into 2023, these slices of Apple-related news should prep you for the year ahead as we <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3683269/what-to-expect-from-apple-in-2023.html">wait to see what Apple achieves in 2023</a>.</p><h2><strong>iPhone, Mac, iPad and hardware rumors</strong></h2>
<p>Across the season, the following tidbits of speculation began to circulate:</p><ul>
<li>The iPhone 15 rumors envision this year's smartphones with cutting-edge A17 <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-29/tsmc-mass-produces-next-gen-chips-to-safeguard-global-lead" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">3nm chips</a> for better performance and much lengthier battery life, a slight improvement in performance, 48MP rear cameras across the entire range, haptic buttons and titanium frame. In related news, Apple may cancel or delay plans for <a href="https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1605392471092912128" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">iPhone SE4</a>.</li>
<li>The first 3nm chips <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-10-02/apple-watch-ultra-review-better-battery-life-and-screen-are-standout-features-l8reavuy?cmpid=BBD100222_POWERON" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">should arrive in Macs this year</a>, possibly with new M2-branded processors, according to 9-5Mac.</li>
<li>TSMC has <a href="https://focustaiwan.tw/sci-tech/202212240008" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">commenced production of 3nm chips</a> in Taiwan. Apple currently relies on chips produced using the foundry's 5nm process.</li>
<li>Apple is <a href="https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1607714641987407872" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">working on a new version of iPad mini</a> equipped with a new processor for launch this year. It may eventually launch a foldable tablet, but not before 2025.</li>
<li>Apple is reportedly working on <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/01/02/apple-reportedly-working-on-airpods-lite-to-compete-with-cheaper-wireless-earbuds/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">AirPods Lite</a>, a lower-cost version of its earbuds designed to compete with all those inexpensive AirPod-like sets you see around.</li>
<li>The company is planning a new 27-in. 120Hz display with Mini-LED.</li>
<li>Perhaps the most interesting snippet relates to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/03/apple-pencil-patent-real-world-color-sampler/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Apple’s new Apple Pencil patent</a>.

<h2><strong>Good news, bad news in the Apple supply chain</strong></h2>
<p>Apple’s challenges with manufacturing in China have been well documented, but a change in the national approach to COVID-19 mitigation seems to have enabled its manufacturing partners to return to more normal production, albeit at <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/coronavirus-outbreak/story/china-reports-37-million-covid-cases-in-a-day-highest-since-january-2022-report-2312756-2022-12-23" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">significant cost</a>.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3684370/a-back-to-business-apple-news-briefing.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
