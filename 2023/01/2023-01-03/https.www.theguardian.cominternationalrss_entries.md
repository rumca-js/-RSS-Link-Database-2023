<ul><li>Englishman sees off his great rival 7-4 in stunning final</li><li>‘This feeling will never be topped,’ says first-time champion</li></ul><p>From the moment he hit his first 180 as a teenager, Michael Smith believed it was his destiny to become world champion. Twice before he has come desperately close, losing in the biggest game of them all – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/01/michael-van-gerwen-michael-smith-world-darts-championship">including to Michael van Gerwen here in 2019</a> – but not even in Smith’s wildest dreams did he suspect he would finally fulfil his destiny in these circumstances. “This feeling will never be topped,” the newest champion of the world admitted after a moment he may have thought would never arrive.</p><p>We hoped this final, the most mouthwatering in years on paper, would deliver. This year’s PDC World Darts Championship has underwhelmed on occasion but Smith and Van Gerwen have been the best two players on the planet throughout the last 12 months, with 16 ranking titles between them. Ignore their pre-tournament world rankings of four and three respectively: this was a meeting of the two finest tungsten technicians.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/03/michael-smith-hits-nine-darter-on-way-past-van-gerwen-to-pdc-world-title">Continue reading...</a>

## Arsenal and Arteta frustrated by Newcastle’s defensive masterclass

<p>Nobody should feel surprised Newcastle were the first visitors to escape the Emirates with as much as a point this season. They put on a masterclass in frustration against a toothless Arsenal who struggled to fashion opportunities, turning long stretches into exhibitions of niggle that made the contest curiously engaging. Perhaps it is no surprise two sides with only a defeat each to their name could not find a victor and the outcome does not leave a huge dent in Arsenal’s title hopes, even if the chance to move 10 points clear had loomed. Newcastle’s hopes of shooting for the summit are remote but they look supremely set for a concerted tilt at the Champions League spots.</p><p>In August the prospect of this clash bearing serious title implications for both sides would barely have registered. But they are here on merit and a fast, open start showed why. Most of the running came from Arsenal, because it always does these days, and they created three presentable openings in the first 10 minutes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/03/arsenal-newcastle-united-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## A desire for Streetcar: the enduring allure of Tennessee Williams’s tantalising classic

<p>Paul Mescal and Patsy Ferran battle it out in the Almeida’s new production of a poetic drama whose ambiguity is enthralling</p><p>Tennessee Williams’s old bus keeps on running. The Almeida’s production of A Streetcar Named Desire, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/dec/08/almeida-theatre-cancels-performances-of-a-streetcar-named-desire-as-actor-withdraws">starring Patsy Ferran</a> and directed by Rebecca Frecknall, is the play’s fifth major UK revival in the last 20 years. That’s not bad going for a work that at its 1947 New York premiere was described as the product of “an almost desperately morbid turn of mind” and two years later in London was dismissed by one critic as “a messy little anecdote”. </p><p>So why has the play lasted so well? There are multiple reasons but the most fundamental is its air of tantalising ambiguity. When Blanche DuBois floats into New Orleans’s ironically named Elysian Fields and finds herself up against her Polish-American brother-in-law, Stanley Kowalski, it seems as if we are facing a primal conflict: Blanche, quoting Hawthorne, Whitman and Poe, seems to represent the poetic spirit while Stanley’s mentality, in the words of that fine critic Harold Clurman, “provides the soil for fascism viewed not as political movement but as a state of being”. That is Blanche’s own view of the situation when she urges her sister, Stella, “In this dark march towards whatever it is we’re approaching … Don’t – don’t hang back with the brutes.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jan/03/a-streetcar-named-desire-tennessee-williams-almeida-paul-mescal-patsy-ferran">Continue reading...</a>

Never mistake share price for the real economy, but it’s worth asking the question: is it possible that 2023 could be a tale of muddling through, as opposed to a story of unmitigated financial gloom?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/jan/03/2023-uk-economy-financial-gloom-energy-prices">Continue reading...</a>

## West Ham playing dangerous game as the Moyes project stops working | Jacob Steinberg

<p>With five defeats in a row and players’ belief in the manager dwindling, West Ham could be better off making a change now</p><p>West Ham’s determination to stand by David Moyes is admirable but risky. It also feels pointless. Moyes remains defiant, insisting he can still turn West Ham’s fortunes around, but the sense around the club is of a slow march towards the exit door. Forget about another push for European qualification: the season is all about survival now and, while there is something honourable about West Ham trying to give Moyes a chance to rediscover his spark, the danger is that they are wasting precious time and making relegation more likely by refusing to make a change.</p><p>This is not a sudden decline. Moyes has done a fine job since returning to the London Stadium three years ago but West Ham have been spiralling for a while. They were outplayed during their defeat by Eintracht Frankfurt in the last four of the Europa League last spring and were fortunate to finish last season seventh after winning six of their last 19 games. Somewhere along the line the Moyes project stopped working. The message has not been landing with the players and it is no longer possible to pin it on the demands of European football tiring out a small squad given that West Ham, who have lost the resilience of old, were the third-biggest spenders in the Premier League last summer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/03/west-ham-must-replace-david-moyes-to-have-better-chance-of-survival">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Daughter of Pablo Picasso who inspired several of her father’s paintings and became an authority on his work</p><p>Among the more unusual presents the artist Pablo Picasso gave to his elder daughter, Maya, was a box of his nail clippings. These she took to be a token of trust. “My father gave them to me because he was frightened that people would use them against him,” recalled Maya Widmaier-Picasso, who has died of pulmonary failure aged 87. “He was afraid that someone, anyone, would take them and cast a spell on him.”</p><p>As with much in the relationship between the Picassos <em>père </em>and <em>fille</em>, the story feels ambiguous. Maya saw the gift as evidence of the bond between them, but it has something of the air of a curse, the clippings part reliquary and part fetish-object. This ambiguity would shape Maya’s life, even after the death of her father in 1973.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jan/03/maya-widmaier-picasso-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Scottish musician and record producer had a wide-reaching influence on indie artists from Björk to Belle and Sebastian </p><p>Alan Rankine, one half of celebrated Scottish indie band the Associates, has died aged 64. The news was confirmed on Tuesday by his sons, Callum and Hamish, who wrote on Facebook that their father “died peacefully at home shortly after spending Christmas with his family”, describing him as “a beautiful, kind and loving man who will be sorely missed”.</p><p>Born in Stirlingshire in 1958, Rankine formed the Associates in 1979 with singer Billy Mackenzie, having made early recordings with him under the name Mental Torture. Rankine and Mackenzie initially broke through with a cover of David Bowie’s Boys Keep Swinging, which itself had been a hit in the UK mere weeks earlier. The attention the pair got from the cover resulted in a record deal with Fiction, and a year later they released The Affectionate Punch, their debut album. Two years later, they followed it up with Sulk, a surprise success that spent 20 weeks on the UK albums chart.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/03/alan-rankine-of-the-associates-dies-aged-64">Continue reading...</a>

## I teach yoga – its appropriation by the white wellness industry is a form of colonialism, but we can move on | Nadia Gilani

<p>All of us in the business can help to make the ancient Indian practice more accessible to those who need it, and change perceptions in the west</p><p>Yoga has become the latest wellness practice to fall victim to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/12/cultural-appropriation-discussion-builds-over-western-yoga-industry">cultural appropriation</a> – but that will come as no surprise to the many industry insiders who have been <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/yoga-whiteness_uk_5e2b2f07c5b67d8874b146fa">speaking out on this issue</a> for years, with growing urgency. What is abundantly clear to me as a yoga teacher is the practice has been led astray by western economic forces. Cultural appropriation remains a contentious and triggering topic for some. “What’s the difference between appropriation and appreciation?” I’m often asked. People argue that it’s a fine line, but I fail to see it. It’s just one of the problems plaguing the industry.</p><p>Working as a yoga teacher in London has shown me just how far the practice has been pulled from its roots. Yoga was simply not designed as a quick workout or to be reduced to #LiveYourBestLife Instagrammable content. It was never meant to fit into a power hour on your lunch break, or as something to be combined with beer or puppies – as some classes do, charging an <a href="https://www.puppy-yoga.co.uk/book-online">eye-watering £35 </a>for the privilege. Yoga in the west has been so heavily commodified that “Namastay in bed” T-shirts and tattoos of decontextualised Sanskrit and Hindu gods have become commonplace. Bindis – an auspicious religious symbol with Hindu origins – are worn as fashion accessories, alongside bum-sculpting activewear. </p><p>Nadia Gilani is a yoga teacher and author of The Yoga Manifesto</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

<p>From Ezra Collective’s joyous jazz to Little Simz’s old-school rap and King Gizzard’s madcap psychedelia – these were your favourites albums of the year</p><p>This record is fabulously produced and there’s not a bad track to be found. It’s one of those rare albums you can play on repeat without getting tired of it. Sometimes, Nicole Wray’s soulful voice sounds like she’s time-travelled from the 1960s, and other times it’s distinctly more modern, like on Through It All. Piece of Me and Joy &amp; Pain evoke an Aretha Franklin-esque heartache, with captivating melodies. But there’s also that completely addictive rhythm perfectly captured by Tommy Brenneck and Leon Michels, which provides such a stable foundation for Wray to show off her vocal skills. <strong>Darragh Boyd, 34, London </strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/03/music-that-will-be-forever-in-my-heart-readers-best-albums-of-2022">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The hit-and-miss Drive director brings some spellbinding visuals to a new six-part thriller but struggles to make what counts for a plot feel quite as arresting</p><p>With his latest project Copenhagen Cowboy, it would seem that film-maker Nicolas Winding Refn – going by NWR more and more as of late, for ease of consistent and concise branding – faces a pivotal juncture on multiple fronts.</p><p>Back in his native Denmark for the first time since 2005, working under the constraints of Covid, settling into a streaming miniseries period that’s taken him from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/20/too-old-to-die-young-nicolas-winding-refn-amazon-show-an-indulgence-too-far">Amazon</a> to Netflix, and having recently turned 50 years old, he has reached the point at which most artists might conduct a personal inventory and evolve in some meaningful way as a consequence of it. The generous read of his career’s flattened arc posits that having <em>not</em> done this is a testament to the clarity and force of his polarizing yet inarguably singular vision. With unflagging confidence in his style and pet themes, he’s muscled through every reason to change and held fast to his Serbian gangsters, Thai martial artists, terse avenging angels, POV insert shots of hands and abandoned rave lighting schemes of lurid neon-charged color.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/03/copenhagen-cowboy-review-nicolas-winding-refn-netflix-series">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A culture of secrecy around sperm and egg donations has given way to greater openness, helped along by a key legal change</p><p>Since 2009, the number of donor-conceived children born in the UK has <a href="https://www.hfea.gov.uk/about-us/publications/research-and-data/trends-in-egg-sperm-and-embryo-donation-2020/">more than tripled</a>. They now account for one in 170 of all births, which means, as the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) chair, Julia Chain, puts it, “a couple of donor-conceived children in every primary school, and an immeasurable amount of joy brought to families that could not have otherwise existed”. While nearly half of all donor gametes are used by heterosexual couples suffering male- or female-factor infertility, much of the recent increase, particularly in the use of donor sperm, has been driven by women in same-sex relationships and solo mums.</p><p>The opening up of new routes to having children is a wonderful thing. But as the practice of donor conception – using donor sperm, eggs or embryos to create a family – has become more common, the resulting ethical dilemmas are also becoming more complex. Crucially, though, many warmly welcome the important changes happening this year, whereby donor-conceived children reaching 18 will finally have access to identifying information about their donors.</p><p>Zeynep Gurtin is a lecturer in women’s health at UCL, an authority member of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority and a fertility consultant</p><p>Some names have been changed</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/03/children-donor-conceived-origins-sperm-egg-donations">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Brazil’s new president is determined to reverse Bolsonaro’s scorched-earth approach to the environment</p><p>This week, as Brazilian president <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/01/brazil-lula-presidency-new-era">Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva</a> was preparing to be sworn in for an unprecedented third term, a key concern was whether the weather would allow him to wave to assembled supporters in Brasília from an open-top convertible, as is customary. It certainly marked a departure from the more serious concerns that had haunted the transfer of power between him and his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, in previous weeks. </p><p>Thousands of Bolsonaro followers, after all, had refused to accept the outcome of last year’s elections. Many camped outside military barracks urging the armed forces to intervene, committing serious acts of <a href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/internacional/en/brazil/2022/12/bolsonarists-cause-violence-and-turmoil-on-lulas-diplomation-day.shtml">vandalism</a> in the nation’s capital.

That’s testament to My Neighbour Totoro’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jun/28/muppet-power-rsc-puppet-legends-my-neighbour-totoro-staging-studio-ghibli-fluffy-monsters">puppet masters</a>, of course, but also to the warm performance of Mei Mac as the younger of the Kusakabe sisters who encounter the furry forest sprite. The scene in which she scales the sleeping creature’s tummy is a delight. As her namesake, Mei, she veers between happy-as-can-be glee, determination and distress whether through mile-a-minute dialogue or, just as effectively, in silence. Adult actors playing kids can grate but Mac fully inhabits her character and lets us see the others through her eyes. On TV, she has already starred in Call the Midwife and Nigel Ng’s sketch show East Mode.

Despite being the world’s second-largest public company by market capitalisation, it got left out of the snappy acronym for the big five – FAANG – alongside Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google, in favour of Netflix, a company seven percent its size. Even when you add them to the equation (and GAFAM seems the most popular ordering, though given Google and Facebook’s rebrands to Alphabet and Meta, it should really be MAMAA), Microsoft has avoided the scrutiny its peers have been subjected to.</p><p>Part of that is to do with where the companies make their profits. Microsoft’s consumer brands are large and popular, but don’t feel like unstoppable behemoths compared to the rest of the MAMAAs. Amazon towers over e-commerce; Meta owns social networking; Alphabet dominates web browsers, email, and search; while Apple practically prints money with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/10/iphone-14-review-apple-price-design">a phone</a> that can credibly be called the most successful consumer product ever released. Microsoft, though, makes its money through enterprise sales and cloud computing, and its unbroken power over desktop operating systems seems like a relic of the past rather than a meaningful focus of attention in the present.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jan/03/why-a-67bn-takeover-could-make-microsoft-a-gaming-behemoth">Continue reading...</a>

<p>One study<em> </em>grimly noted that human noise may even be scrambling the eggs of baby fish</p><p>Noise pollution is one of the gravest yet least recognized health threats of our time. Even moderate levels of noise – the kind that surrounds us in any urban environment – increase risks of cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment, developmental delays and dementia. Now, scientists are revealing that non-humans, too, suffer from noise pollution – and that they are far more sensitive than humans.</p><p>Perhaps nowhere is this more urgent than in the global oceans. Marine animals see and sense the world through sound, which travels faster and farther underwater than light. Whales – which use sound to find prey and navigate, communicate and mate – are one well-known example. But scientists are now revealing that a vast range of marine creatures are exquisitely sensitive to sound. The range of negative effects caused by marine noise pollution is staggering: delayed development, hampered reproduction, stunted growth, distorted migration paths.</p><p>Karen Bakker is the director of the University of British Columbia’s Program on Water Governance and the author of The Sounds of Life: How Digital Technology is Bringing Us Closer to the Worlds of Animals and Plants</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/03/noise-pollution-is-a-menace-to-humanity-and-a-deadly-threat-to-animals">Continue reading...</a>

The roof isn’t made from a typical material: instead of absorbing heat, its paint-like coating reflects the sun’s energy upward. That benefits anyone working inside the building, officials say, as it cools and makes the interior more comfortable – as well as lowering energy bills.</p><p>This type of roofing design comes at an urgent time for America’s second-largest city. In Los Angeles, long romanticized for its year-round sunshine and Mediterranean climate, heat is a slow-moving disaster.

<p>Mary McCartney’s documentary about the legendary home to the Beatles’ and many other stars’ recordings is an enjoyable diversion</p><p>Putting her privileged access to good use, Mary McCartney has directed this enjoyable documentary about Abbey Road Studios in London – famously the site of the Beatles’ classic recordings (her dad is Paul of course), but much more besides. McCartney’s film takes us through the history of the building itself (in the St John’s Wood neighbourhood of London, perhaps only Lord’s cricket ground is more of an English icon).</p><p>It was designed to house a symphony orchestra, and its first occupant in 1931 was Edward Elgar conducting the LSO. It looks very different from the way we think of recording studios,small spaces divided from the mixing suite by a pane of glass. In fact two of the studios are huge, where mighty producer George Martin presided over everything from suites accessed by flights of stairs, like going up to the manager’s office from the echoing factory shop floor.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/03/if-these-walls-could-sing-review-mystery-tour-of-abbey-road-studios">Continue reading...</a>

He was a hero to conservative Catholics, but he will be most remembered for his dramatic resignation in 2013 – the first pope in 600 years to quit rather than die in office. He pleaded physical frailty. “Having before God examined my conscience over and over, I have come to the certain knowledge that my strength, due to the burdens of age, is no longer suitable for properly administering the Petrine office,” he wrote, but he lasted almost another 10 years before dying at the age of 95 on New Year’s Eve.</p><p>Catherine Pepinster is a former editor of the Tablet and the author of The Keys and the Kingdom: The British and the Papacy</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/03/papal-succession-benedict-xvi-funeral-cardinals-pope-francis">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The 1500m world champion on his father’s commentary during his victory, Ingebrigtsen’s reaction and why he hid his twin’s running spikes at school</p><p>“I’m glad I just said: ‘Oh my God!’” Jake Wightman suggests as he remembers his reaction when he crossed the line <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/20/jake-wightman-stuns-1500m-field-to-claim-world-title-as-dad-commentates">to win the 1500m</a> in a stunning result at the world championships five months ago. “Imagine if I’d chosen to say something a lot worse.

<p>I have a problem with premature ejaculation, and numbing spray only spoils the mood</p><p><strong>I am a single</strong><strong> male in my 20s who often goes on dates, so usually when I have sex</strong><strong> it is with somebody new. </strong><strong>I climax way too early</strong><strong> </strong><strong>and often ejaculate prematurely. </strong><strong>Is there anything I can do about it? I love sex</strong><strong> but I find myself stressing about</strong><strong> it because of performance anxiety. I</strong><strong> sometimes pretend</strong><strong> during intercourse that I haven’t ejaculated yet just to avoid the shame</strong><strong>. </strong><strong>At times, I only last for </strong><strong>30 seconds. I have a numbing spray, but it is very awkward to use and it can</strong><strong> spoil the mood when I stop to apply it. How do I approach this problem, especially when getting with new people?</strong></p><p>While many women and men say they want athletic lovemaking with prolonged intercourse or penetration, many others say the opposite. The latter group either prefer a short amount of penetration with less chance of discomfort or irritation – or no penetration at all. This is especially understandable for women, since female pleasure and the means to orgasm are best achieved via direct stimulation of the clitoris, which is located outside the vagina. Early ejaculation is a treatable issue, but try not to stress about it. Being anxious about your “performance” will only exacerbate the situation. Instead, work on improving your ability to please your partner with skills that do not involve your penis, such as oral and manual stimulation. There are many highly erotic, non-penetrative techniques and it’s time you stopped worrying about how your penis performs and think about what else would directly please your partner. Combine good communication skills with your personal seductive style to elicit information about his or her preferences, and practice sharing what you need with them. Even people who do not worry about early ejaculation would be wise to adopt this course of action.</p><p>Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</p><p>If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to <a href="mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com">private.lives@theguardian.com</a> (please don’t send attachments).

<p>A propulsive post-heist thriller that functions as a bravura exercise in generating suspense</p><p>American writer Jonathan Dee is best known here for <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jun/20/the-privileges-union-atlantic">The Privileges</a></em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jun/20/the-privileges-union-atlantic"> (2010)</a>, which showed us a New York banking family rendered dysfunctional by the ill-gotten gains of money-market skulduggery. Money, to say nothing of privilege, also lies at the heart of his new book, which takes the starker form of a claustrophobic monologue from an unnamed middle-aged male fugitive going off-grid for reasons he won’t divulge. Avoiding CCTV, he’s destroyed his devices and, after pitching up in search of a bed in a poor district in an unspecified city, he’s about to ditch his scrap-salvaged car, too; all he’s keeping is a cryptically procured envelope containing $168,000. “The money is mine now, though that won’t stop other people from maintaining that at least some of it is theirs,” he says early on, coyly alluding to his “crimes”.</p><p>The stage is set for a propulsive post-heist thriller, with inbuilt tension, in the sense that the narrator will be rumbled before long – but for what? While key disclosures are expertly postponed, we soon sense that <em>Sugar Street</em> hunts bigger game in any case, with the getaway premise only a pretext for exploring nothing less than the politics of 21st-century selfhood. When the narrator finds a room to rent cash in hand on a don’t-ask-don’t-tell basis, he ponders the cover story he might give his landlady, privately mulling explanations from being in witness protection to simply being unable to “stand being seen as data... I couldn’t stand the idea that every little choice I’d made, however thoughtless or dumb, was now part of my history”.</p><p><em>Sugar Street</em> by Jonathan Dee is published by Corsair (£16.99).

<p>To get the red wall back on board, Labour should commit to bold action on transport and show what ‘levelling up’ really means</p><p>For those of us living and working in the north it has become achingly clear that our <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/06/britain-train-service-renationalisation-delay">transport system is broken</a>. Long before any strike action was announced, the region’s public transport was suffering from creaking infrastructure, staff shortages and a daily dose of long delays and routine cancellations. For those of us who commute between northern cities by train, getting to work in decent time has become a game of chance. Others have become used to missing medical appointments and elderly relatives becoming isolated.</p><p>It’s time Labour made a bold stance on transport, as part of its commitment to levelling up and transitioning to net zero. There is plenty of evidence to lay bare the regional inequality in transport spending. We know that if the north had received the same transport investment as London in the decade between 2009 and 2019, it would have received <a href="https://www.ippr.org/news-and-media/press-releases/ippr-north-broken-transport-promises-come-as-new-evidence-shows-widening-transport-spending-gap">£86bn more</a> than it did.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/03/britain-transport-system-keir-starmer-red-wall-labour-levelling-up">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Forgotten Songs Collective aims to preserve ancient hill tribe’s music by bringing it to a global audience</p><p>As he sat around a fire, deep in the forests that cover the hills of Dima Hasao in Assam, a shadow of sadness came into the eyes of Lallura Darnei. Now in his seventies, Darnei is one of the oldest members of the Biate community, an ancient hill tribe living in north-east India. The songs he sang around the flames that night five years ago, speaking of great floods and the birds that flap their wings at sunset, dated back so many generations the tribe said they were as old as time.</p><p>But, said Darnei, when he died these songs would probably die with him, and with it the history, the knowledge, culture of the Biate, would be gone for ever. The younger generation of the tribe had fallen in love with guitar music and K-pop and had not learned the traditional songs. They could not pick up the ancient melodies and he was the last of the Biate who knew how to play and make the siranda, the tribe’s traditional violin crafted from wood and the dried skin of an iguana.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/03/forgotten-songs-collective-saving-music-biate-indian-hill-tribe-global-audience">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Kyiv claims responsibility for deadly attack on Russian-controlled city of Makiivka; Russia is planning a protracted campaign of drone attacks to ‘exhaust’ Ukraine, Zelenskiy warns</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia+ukraine">See all our Russia-Ukraine war coverage</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Ukraine has claimed responsibility for the New Year’s Day attack on a complex in the Russian-occupied city of Makiivka.</strong> “On December 31, up to 10 units of enemy military equipment of various types were destroyed and damaged” in the town of Makiivka in the eastern region of Donetsk, the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GeneralStaff.ua/posts/pfbid0Jfo5rgYzLmMJP1T4kg1tbneHuDeGh6DsaMedhCt41mGJemsJ6RAoLWkqDktyYUuGl">statement</a>. It said the human “losses” were still being established.</p><p><strong>The attack on Makiivka <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/02/ukraine-strike-russian-held-makiivka-reportedly-kills-troops">killed dozens of recently mobilised troops sent by Moscow</a></strong>, in what could be one of the deadliest known incidents involving Russian conscripts so far. Ukraine’s military command said up to 400 Russian soldiers were killed in the incident in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, but this claim was not independently verified. Russia’s defence ministry said 63 Russian soldiers died when Ukraine hit “a temporary deployment facility” with four US-supplied Himars missiles.</p><p><strong>Satellite <a href="https://t.me/Pravda_Gerashchenko/58680">images</a> taken by US-based company Planet Labs that purportedly showing the aftermath of the strike on Makiivka have circulated online</strong>, showing the building that allegedly housed the Russian troops before and after it was hit. The images, dated 2 January, show a building almost completely razed to the ground. Unverified <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2023/jan/02/ukraine-footage-shows-aftermath-of-strike-on-russian-controlled-makiivka-video">footage posted online</a> of the aftermath of the blast also showed a huge building reduced to smoking rubble.</p><p><strong>Several waves of Russian drones targeted critical infrastructure in Ukraine’s capital Kyiv and surrounding areas early on Monday morning.</strong> Debris from a destroyed drone hit Kyiv’s northeastern Desnianskiy district, wounding a 19-year-old man who was later taken to hospital, the city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, <a href="https://t.me/vitaliy_klitschko/1745">said</a>. Energy infrastructure facilities in the city were damaged, causing power and heating outages.</p><p><strong>Ukraine claims to have destroyed 40 Russian drones heading for Kyiv on Sunday night</strong>, with 15 destroyed over neighbouring regions, three in the Kyiv region and 22 directly over the capital. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the country’s forces have shot down more than 80 drones since the start of 2023.</p><p><strong>Russia is planning a protracted campaign of attacks with Iranian drones to “exhaust” Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned </strong>in his Monday night <a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/zaraz-usim-hto-zaluchenij-do-zahistu-neba-treba-buti-osobliv-80209">address</a>. “It is probably banking on exhaustion. Exhausting our people, our anti-aircraft defences, our energy.” Ukraine, he said, had to “act and do everything so that the terrorists’ fail in their aim, as all their others have failed.”</p><p><strong>Zelenskiy said he expects the first tranche of EU macro-financial aid to arrive in January</strong> after speaking to European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen on Monday.<strong> </strong>Zelenskiy thanked Von der Leyen for her support, adding the €18bn ($19bn) worth of financial assistance “is extremely important right now, when Russia is trying to gather new forces for aggression”.</p><p><strong>Ukraine and the European Union will hold a summit in Kyiv on 3 February to discuss financial and military support</strong>, Zelenskiy’s office said in a statement on Monday. “The parties discussed expected results of the next Ukraine-EU summit to be held on 3 February in Kyiv and agreed to intensify preparatory work,” the statement read.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/03/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-314-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>
