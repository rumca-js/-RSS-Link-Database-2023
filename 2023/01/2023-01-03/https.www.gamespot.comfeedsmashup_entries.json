They'll heal you at different rates and even apply buffs in some cases, so use our guide to learn every cooking time in Sea of Thieves, the healing differences among food choices, and where to find everything you need for a hearty meal. As they say, a mango a day keeps the scurvy away. Maybe.</p><h2>Sea of Thieves fruits and healing tier list</h2><p>Yes, like your favorite hero shooter or MOBA, the fruits in Sea of Thieves can be split into tiers. Unlike those games, however, the fruit tiers are objective and, once you get to know them, obvious. Here's the full list of fruits alongside how much of your health bar each item will heal you per piece eaten</p><table><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">Fruit</th><th scope=\"col\">HP Restored (Out of 100)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Banana</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Coconut</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Pomegranate</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td><p>Mango</p></td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td><p>Pineapple</p></td><td>100 per bite; two bites per fruit</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Because each pirate can hold up to five food items at any time, it makes sense to swap out things like bananas and coconuts for pineapples and mangoes whenever possible. However, for even better healing aids, you'll want to ditch the all-fruit diet and seek some animal-based proteins. Yes, in Sea of Thieves, fish and meats will serve you best, so long as you know how to cook.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sea-of-thieves-cooking-times-best-fruits-and-more/1100-6510275/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/glass-onion-rian-johnsons-new-knives-out-movie-is-one-of-netflixs-biggest-ever/1100-6510274/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Glass Onion: Rian Johnson's New Knives Out Movie Is One Of Netflix's Biggest Ever", "date_published": "2023-01-03 21:09:00+00:00", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Writer-director Rian Johnson's highly-anticipated follow-up to 2019 Knives Out finally hit Netflix on December 23, and has secured the top spot on the streamer's English-language film charts for the week of December 26 to January 1.
