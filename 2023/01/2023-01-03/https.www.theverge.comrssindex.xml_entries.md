  <p id="DQDKCA">Twitter is going to “expand” the political advertising it allows on the platform in “the coming weeks,” the Twitter Safety account <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1610399203481784320">tweeted on Tuesday</a>. Twitter banned all political advertising <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20940587/twitter-political-ad-ban-election-2020-jack-dorsey-facebook">in late 2019</a>, but the company is apparently loosening its rules just a couple of months after major ad agencies <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/14/23459254/twitter-high-risk-ads-groupm-advertisers-content-moderation">recommended</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/11/23453575/omnicom-media-group-twitter-advertising-pause">against</a> buying ads on the platform.</p>
<p id="RGqNfZ">Exactly what will change under the new policies outside of what’s mentioned in the tweet is unclear. But the return of political ads could have a major effect on the platform, especially ahead of the 2024 US presidential election. We asked Twitter for details, but the company has dissolved its press office since Elon Musk took over, so we’re not expecting a response. </p>

## Why Tesla’s Model Y might not be eligible for the new EV tax credit

  <p id="VvkseU">If you were waiting until after New Year to pick up a Tesla Model Y in hopes it’d qualify you for the new federal tax credit, you might be in for a disappointment. The IRS released a 2023 list of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/1/23534707/ev-tax-credit-eligible-vehicle-list-tesla-chevy-cadillac-vw">vehicles that qualify for the new $7,500 incentive</a>, and while Tesla’s popular hatchback is on it, the most common five-seater versions won’t be eligible.</p>
<p id="Tdi7xs"><a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-49/subtitle-B/chapter-V/part-523/section-523.5">According to federal specifications</a>, the five-seater Model Y Long Range isn’t considered a “non-passenger automobile,” the category under which SUVs officially fall. They also don’t fall under <a href="https://www.irs.gov/publications/p946#en_US_2020_publink1000107426">the IRS’s main SUV qualifier</a>, which is that the gross vehicle weight must be between 6,000 and 14,000 pounds. The dual-motor Model Y has <a href="https://www.tesla.com/ownersmanual/modely/en_cn/GUID-E47C4A6D-528E-419C-8C57-FD3864644C34.html">a curb mass of about 4,403 pounds</a>.</p>

  <p id="76mMAF">Microsoft’s cutting off Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 from security updates and technical support on January 10th. That’s just one week from today and also marks the launch of Microsoft Edge 109 — <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2022/12/09/microsoft-edge-and-webview2-ending-support-for-windows-7-and-windows-8-8-1/">the last version</a> to support the aged operating systems.</p>
<p id="SlSBN1">But Edge isn’t the only major browser ditching Windows 7 and 8.1. In October, Google announced that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/24/23421716/google-chrome-windows-7-8-1-end-support">Chrome will end support for Windows 7 and 8.1 on February 7th</a>. Although both browsers will continue to work on these devices, they won’t receive any critical security updates or new features. Support for WebView2, the tool that allows developers to embed web-based content into their apps, is going away on January 10th, too.</p>

Since then, she’s struggled to gain the necessary support of moderate Democrats and has faced an intense opposition campaign staged by Republicans and telecom industry groups.

  <p id="8YcEA6">A Louisiana law requiring age verification for adult websites has kicked in, renewing long-standing concerns about online privacy. The policy, Louisiana <a href="https://legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=1289498">HB 142</a>, requires sites composed of “thirty-three and one-third percent” or more of pornographic content to verify that people accessing them are 18 or older. That includes services like Pornhub, which has started requiring a government-issued ID for access.</p>
<p id="vYHMPg">Pornhub didn’t confirm the new policy, but video posted to Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/fodderyfodder/status/1610014207533060099?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1610014207533060099%7Ctwgr%5E3f24d183f2767e9b8d68ffd63c2a5c92c1bf3612%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcmag.com%2Fnews%2Flouisiana-law-requires-id-to-view-porn">apparently demonstrates</a> what users see in Louisiana.

The Flow <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22249408/asus-rog-flow-x13-review-price-specs-features">X13</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/17/23074750/asus-rog-flow-x16-2-in-1-gaming-laptop-specs-features">X16</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22989540/asus-rog-flow-z13-gaming-tablet-windows-specs-review">Z13</a> are all getting hardware improvements, including the latest processors and mobile GPUs — but perhaps the most notable improvement with these gaming laptops is their larger batteries.</p>
<p id="VthSl3">Asus’ Flow line is relatively unique among gaming laptops, sporting 2-in-1 displays and — in the case of the X16 and Z13 — compatibility with an Asus-made external GPU to boost gaming performance. However, the most recent iterations of these laptops suffered from abysmal battery life, something Asus is trying to amend with the new models of the X13 and...</p>

While it’s not uncommon to see gaming laptops with displays up to 17.3 inches, these new additions are taking portable displays to a new level.</p>
<p id="lz8ahX">The 18-inch models of both laptops will have configurations available that use Asus’ new Nebula HDR technology that’s capable of up to 1,100 nits of brightness and is Dolby Vision compatible. You’ll also have the option to pick between either 165Hz or 240Hz refresh rates for both models.</p>

  <p id="ZInh9T">Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G14 is one of the hottest mainstream gaming laptops around, and its 2023 iteration is sure to be one of the most anticipated releases of this upcoming year. Not only is it one of a few gaming laptops that can provide all-day battery life but also it’s one of <em>very </em>few 14-inch gaming rigs that can achieve competitive frame rates on many modern games. </p>
<p id="EkCcu3">It’s hard to imagine how Asus could improve on what was already such a successful package. But the company has found perhaps the one thing the G14 was really missing — and frankly, it’s been a long time coming. This year, the 14-inch Zephyrus will have a Mini LED display option.</p>

Both will release in the US and Europe sometime in the second quarter.</p>
<p id="ZPqyYb">These OLED 1440p (QHD) gaming monitors are pretty similar to the ones that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/15/23509735/lg-ultragear-oled-gaming-monitor-27-45-inch-display-first-look">LG showed off a few weeks ago</a>. Both have a 240Hz refresh rate and an incredibly fast .03-millisecond response time, but the spec similarities aren’t a one-to-one match.

<p id="3EwZfa">The 27-inch model, which starts at $1,199.99, can be equipped with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866533/intel-12th-gen-cpu-alder-lake-mainstream-consumer-desktops-ces-2022">12th Gen</a> Intel Core i5-1240p or i7-1260p processors, according to Erin Davern, an Acer spokesperson.

The Halo Swing shares the Halo’s RGB-lit base, which emanates colorful lights and thus makes the speaker double as a light source.

  <p id="LAJgMA">The Predator Helios is at the top end of Acer’s lineup of gaming laptops, and it has some special updates in store for 2023. The Helios comes in two new sizes, including 16- and 18-inch models, just like the latest releases from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23281425">Alienware</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23294874">Razer</a>. These new Helios laptops have impressive specs that I’ll dig into below, but I’m most looking forward to trying out one thing in particular: their top-of-the-line 250Hz Mini LED display option. </p>
<p id="g8syNd">This is big news because Mini LED-backlit displays are still rare, usually reserved for high-end TVs, pricey tablets like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23427142/apple-ipad-pro-12-9-2022-tablet-ipados-apple-pencil-review">12.9-inch iPad Pro</a>, and now some beastly laptops.
