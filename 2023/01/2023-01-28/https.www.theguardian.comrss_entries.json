Poitras gives the footage of Goldin\u2019s protests and covert meetings a nervy tension that wouldn\u2019t be out of place in a political thriller. What becomes clear from the film, which vividly details the cultural backdrop as well as Goldin\u2019s work, is that fear has never been part of Goldin\u2019s vocabulary, either creatively or personally.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/28/all-the-beauty-and-the-bloodshed-review-nan-goldin-sackler-pharma-family-laura-poitras-documentary-oscar-nominated\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-UK", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jan/28/on-my-radar-ibram-x-kendi-cultural-highlights", "title": "On my radar: Ibram X Kendi\u2019s cultural highlights", "date_published": "2023-01-28 15:00:22+00:00", "description": "<p>The American historian on a mind-blowing book, the sheer beauty of South Africa and and seeing his name come up as an answer on his favourite gameshow</p><p>The historian Ibram X Kendi, one of the foremost scholars of race in the US, was born in Queens, New York, in 1982.

Their father is Williams\u2019 husband, the director Thomas Kail; she also has a 17-year-old, Matilda, from her relationship with the actor Heath Ledger.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/28/michelle-williams-interview-the-fabelmans-spielberg-metoo-money\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-UK", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/28/gunthers-millions-could-this-tale-of-a-multi-millionaire-dog-kill-the-documentary-for-good", "title": "Gunther\u2019s Millions: could this tale of a multi-millionaire dog kill the documentary for good?", "date_published": "2023-01-28 07:00:13+00:00", "description": "<p>A highly salacious story lies behind footage of a diamond chain-wearing German shepherd on his private jet. But this series\u2019s desperation to create memes risks undermining its entire genre</p><p>Documentaries used to be easy: a shot of a guy with facial hair driving his car; some sort of Expo where people are behaving oddly; a pop-punk song that\u2019s a bit on the nose; and a doomed attempt to set up a legacy celebrity. That\u2019s what I used to like: grainy film footage, fuzzes of sound, filming on a windy day. Ideally, it would win an award from an academy you have never heard of. Michael Moore would turn up at some point wearing a big T-shirt and a hat.</p><p>This is no longer the case Documentaries are big business now, with budgets and cachet.

The language of documentary has changed because the audience has changed: everyone who willingly appears in a documentary now knows they are one snappy soundbite away from being the Fyre Festival Bottled Water Guy or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/05/carole-baskin-tiger-king-faces-of-2020\">Carole Baskin From Tiger King</a>. Essentially, documentaries used to have a whiff of homework about them, a certain librarial dorkiness, and now they are for everyone. This is good in one way (more people watching documentaries!) and very, very bad in another (more people watching documentaries). It will be impossible to make a true documentary in an era when millions of people watch them on Netflix, because everyone participating in them \u2013 everyone who appears on camera, smoothing down their shirt and asking if their mic pack works OK \u2013 knows they are this close to being 2023\u2019s first meme. Nobody speaks normally when they are trying to become a gif.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/28/gunthers-millions-could-this-tale-of-a-multi-millionaire-dog-kill-the-documentary-for-good\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-UK", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/28/why-do-so-few-people-have-red-hair-and-why-do-we-fart-try-our-kids-quiz", "title": "Why do so few people have red hair, and why do we fart?
