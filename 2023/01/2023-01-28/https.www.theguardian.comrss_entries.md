<p>Son Heung-min’s peach of an opener that broke the deadlock here was regaled with the following: “Nice one Sonny, let’s have another one.” The ditty came from the 5500-plus travelling Tottenham fans who saw their beloved No 7 ace a 25-yard finish past Preston’s goalkeeper Freddie Woodman as if coolly hitting down a first-serve winner.</p><p>Cue Son greeting supporters with the cupped-hands-around-eyes “mask” celebration as this tie finally awoke. The strike came on 50 minutes, which gave Preston 40 more to try and force an equaliser or better, and they pressed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/28/preston-tottenham-fa-cup-fourth-round-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## The Welsh Valley That Won the Lottery review – a bittersweet good news tale that’s not like the others

<p>There’s no sneering at the way these ordinary folk spend their winnings here – just a deftly made, unpretentious documentary about a long overdue slice of luck</p><p>‘It’s good news! You don’t hear much good news, do you?” At the library in Rhymney, Caerphilly, one morning in May 2022, there’s only one topic of conversation at the “talking cafe”, a weekly event set up to combat loneliness in the small former mining town. Sat in a circle, sipping tea and crunching biscuits, everyone is on about Rhymney residents winning the lottery: more than 400 of them have just shared £3.7m. A documentary crew have got wind of the windfall and are here to shoot The Welsh Valley That Won the Lottery (Channel 4).</p><p>The winners were playing the People’s Postcode Lottery, a clever variation on a normal Lotto that randomly selects a postcode instead of numbers then assigns a large prize to every ticket-holder on one lucky street, with smaller ones going to players close by who have only matched the first half of their postcode. Effectively it sets up a syndicate for your neighbourhood, and in Rhymney where the game is evidently popular it feels like half the town has won.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/28/the-welsh-valley-that-won-the-lottery-review-a-bittersweet-good-news-tale-thats-not-like-the-others">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The transgender debate seems to offer many proudly progressive men a licence  to insult women who disagree with them</p><p>The continued <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/20/andrew-tates-detention-extended-by-romanian-court-until-27-february">detention</a> of the professional misogynist Andrew Tate deprives fans of a treasured role model. Even if Tate is soon free to resume his life’s work – essentially, telling women to “shut up, bitch” – it could be a while before Romanian police return the luxury cars that validate his alpha male status. At least the incarceration gives Tate a bit longer to improve on “how dare you?!” - his initial response to humiliation by Greta Thunberg. His provocative boasts about these vehicles had put her in mind of “<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/greta-thunberg-claps-back-at-andrew-tates-small-dick-energy-3372184">small dick energy</a>”.</p><p>Where, meanwhile, should his acolytes turn for inspiration? Jeremy Clarkson, the fellow car person, wealthy loudmouth, dedicated Thunberg- and Meghan-phobe? But Clarkson has now twice apologised for his disturbingly sexualised hatred of the Duchess of Sussex: a betrayal rendering him, in circles where Meghan-hating is a sacred rite, her apostate bitch. As for trusted hater Piers Morgan: he lets his wife work.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/28/forget-andrew-tate-what-about-the-host-of-misogynists-in-labours-ranks">Continue reading...</a>

New <a href="https://www.suttontrust.com/our-research/cost-of-living-and-university-students-2023/">polling</a> from the Sutton Trust last week showed that 63% of students are spending less on food and other essentials, while a full third of working-class students have skipped meals.</p><p>Getting help from parents was high up the list of coping strategies, which probably isn’t news to those of you with children.

Halliday lives in north London with his wife and sons.</p><p><strong>What is paleobiology?<br /></strong>In the late 20th century, we began to realise that we could study far more aspects of past life than simply describing the forms and defining them into taxonomies.

<p>Fulham will not make the mistake of underestimating Sunderland when they meet again. The Premier League side will know not to expect anything less than a barrage of pressure at the Stadium of Light. Nobody needs to tell Fulham that Sunderland are moving in the right direction under Tony Mowbray.</p><p>The only disappointment for Mowbray is that Sunderland are not already in the fifth round. The Championship side led early through Jack Clarke and had enough chances to pull clear. Yet they could not kill Fulham off and Tom Cairney earned Marco Silva’s team a replay by equalising during a pulsating second half.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/28/fulham-sunderland-fa-cup-fourth-round-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Since then I’ve gone time and again to marvel at the ridiculousness of the stuff stocked there – or to buy a cheap version of an everyday product.” He also visits EuroShops to source materials for his art series 100Rs (100 Indian rupees). The title is the budget for each sculpture (about 99p) and a reference to one of his favourite songs, by Mumbai punk band the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/the_riot_peddlers/?hl=en-gb">Riot Peddlers</a>. “I like transformative sculptures such as the tennis balls and spoons, which are put together to look like a spider,” says Manek. “That’s particularly fun.”</p><p></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2023/jan/28/discount-store-items-transformed-quirky-sculptures-vivek-manek-in-pictures">Continue reading...</a>

## The goose whisperer: flying high with the wild geese of Norfolk

<p>Nick Acheson has spent many hours studying wild geese. Now he’s written a book about the beauty of these birds and what they can teach us about how to live with nature</p><p>It is a grimy, grubby, dank dusk soon after the shortest day of the year. A mizzle prevents any view of anything as Nick Acheson squelches along a muddy seabank beside the Norfolk coast. Suddenly, from the far distance, a faint song pierces the gloom, the sound soaring like a choir singing in a vaulted cathedral. Hundreds of high-pitched voices draw nearer – and this vast, desolate landscape of wet marsh and damp air is animated by a glorious cacophony of pink-footed geese. We still can’t see them in the mist, but several thousand birds pass overhead, on their way to roost on the salt marsh. Acheson looks up and sighs. “They are the souls of winter,” he says. “The sight and the sound and the movement and the comings and the goings of winter – and they connect us with the world.”</p><p>The spectacle is awesome, free and a rare and precious experience in the modern world: to be a human outnumbered by another species; to witness an abundance of wild birds in one of the most nature-depleted countries on Earth (the UK is ranked 12th worst for “biodiversity intactness” out of 240 countries, according to an RSPB study). Invariably, unfortunately, this experience is threatened by anthropogenic menaces: global heating, avian flu and changing farming practices. And so Acheson is determined to bring wider attention to the wonder of geese.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/28/the-goose-whisperer-flying-high-with-the-wild-geese-of-norfolk">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Dazzling computer-generated images of a newly revamped Liverpool Street do little to establish its merits or flaws</p><p>Property companies have always liked to put the best possible gloss on their proposals – views taken from angles that minimise their bulk, atmospheric effects in their images that make many tonnes of construction materials melt into the air. A virtuoso example was recently presented at Liverpool Street station by Sellar Property Group, which brought us the Shard, in a brief “public consultation” about its grand plans for the venerable terminus.</p><p>The proposal, designed by the architects Herzog and de Meuron, is to put a colossal chunk of real estate above the station concourse and the neighbouring listed Great Eastern hotel, replacing the former’s Victorian-style vault and blocking out the daylight that percolates through it. But you’d be hard pressed to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/23/betjemans-liverpool-street-campaign-revived-in-face-of-new-development">comprehend its impact</a> from the computer-generated images that were on show or the accompanying video and virtual reality walk-through. There was a model that didn’t include several storeys of the new block. In the visuals a dazzling luminosity suffused the no-longer-daylit concourse. The new work was represented as a white substance impervious to weather and dirt. Trees were shown flourishing in overshadowed locations where they would struggle to grow.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/28/architectural-vision-for-london-station-is-little-more-than-smoke-and-mirrors">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The economic downturn, US lawsuits and the fear of rising tech rivals could be reasons for the firm’s 'code red” alert, but it still has an AI ace up its sleeve</p><p>In a strange way, the best thing that could have happened to Google (now masquerading as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/alphabet">Alphabet</a>, its parent company) was Facebook. Why? Because although Google invented <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/surveillance-capitalism">surveillance capitalism</a>, arguably the most toxic business model since the opium trade, it was Facebook that got into the most trouble for its abuses of it. The result was that Google enjoyed an easier ride.

But it was the Facebook boss, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/mark-zuckerberg">Mark Zuckerberg</a> – not Google’s Larry Page, Sergey Brin and their adult supervisor Eric Schmidt – who was awarded the title of evil emperor of the online world.</p><p>This sometimes enabled Google to fly below the regulatory radar and avoid public criticism. Its relative immunity may also have been fostered by credulity induced by its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_evil">“Don’t be evil”</a> motto. What may also have helped is the way that, over the years, <a href="https://www.failory.com/blog/google-failed-products">it fumbled quite a few things</a> – Google+, Google Wave, Google Glass, Knol and Google Reader, to name just five. On the other hand, it also managed to create useful and successful products – Gmail, for example, plus Google Maps, Google Scholar, Google Earth and Google Books.

She founded the advocacy organisation Pain (Prescription Addiction Intervention Now) in part to challenge the “reputation laundering” of the Sackler name through hefty donations to museums and galleries. It’s a stirring, courageous act from a woman who has more to lose than most by squaring up to the art world. Poitras gives the footage of Goldin’s protests and covert meetings a nervy tension that wouldn’t be out of place in a political thriller.

## Ready to plunge in? The rise and rise of immersive art

<p>Thousands are flocking to hi-tech shows of work by Van Gogh, Dalí and, from next month, David Hockney, in London. What makes these exhibitions so fascinating – and popular?</p><p>Concerning immersion, a shower is as far as I’m usually prepared to go. I don’t recognise the existence of bathtubs and when it comes to immersive art, I prefer to be an engaged and critically alert observer, not a participant. I made an exception for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/nicholas-hytner">Nicholas Hytner</a>’s Shakespeare productions at the Bridge theatre in London, though I chose to watch the scrum – with the rest of the audience as a harried, feuding mob in <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/feb/04/julius-caesar-nicholas-hytner-the-brothers-size-the-culture-a-farce-review">Julius Caesar</a></em> or a gaggle of bewitched revellers in <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jun/16/midsummer-night-nights-dream-review-bridge-gwendoline-christie-while-the-sun-shines-vanya-and-sonia">A Midsummer Night’s Dream</a> – </em>from the safety of a fixed seat. I love hearing the soprano at the end of Wagner’s <em>Tristan und Isolde</em> sing about ecstatically drowning in the torrents of sound that pour out of her, which she calls “the wafting universe of the world-breath”. In the opera house, you can feel this sensorium throbbing around you, but it’s only resonant air, and your head, like the singer’s, remains above the merely symbolic water.</p><p>The immersion promised by an array of art exhibitions throughout London is also a harmless metaphor: at worst, you are inundated by light. Even so, there’s something alluringly mystical about these shows, now so popular that they have become a cult. Experienced in this way, paintings no longer exist to be viewed from an analytical distance and appraised in formal terms; their purpose is to supply sensation and alter consciousness. The freestanding work of art disappears as we are fused with it, merged in a detonation of colour or submerged by images that cascade down the walls, gush on to the floor and wash us away.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jan/28/immersive-art-exhibitions-popular-david-hockney-van-gogh-dali-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For more than an hour Leicester were frustrated with their League Two opponents Walsall gamely providing resistance but Brendan Rodgers turned to his proven FA Cup finisher and Kelechi Iheanacho duly delivered. The striker had only been on the pitch for five minutes, as a second-half substitute, but his deflected strike – his 17th goal in the competition from 23 appearances – was enough to edge Leicester into the fifth round.</p><p>Despite dominating possession and peppering efforts at the Walsall goal Leicester had to wait until the 68th<sup> </sup>minute for the breakthrough. Youri Tielemans, who struck the winner for Leicester in the 2021 FA Cup final, missed a penalty after the break with his effort cannoning off the post. But Iheanacho, who has scored the most goals in the competition since his debut in 2016, again made the difference and provided a timely lift for Leicester and welcome relief from their struggles in the Premier League.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/28/walsall-leicester-fa-cup-fourth-round-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The New Yorker taps into the rage that women are often shamed for expressing on her impressive alt-rock debut</p><p>Growing up in Manhattan, Sabrina Teitelbaum performed under various guises at open-mic nights from an early age.

It’s lyrically that she’s most exciting, however, her at times gentle delivery concealing words brimming with anger. “I’m going back to him/ I know my therapist’s pissed,” begins recent single Sepsis, before adding: “We both know he’s a dick.”</p><p>Blondshell’s self-titled debut is released in April.

<p>The 14-time European champions are on the comeback trail again after humbling by Barcelona in Spanish Super Cup final</p><p>Carlo Ancelotti knew but then so did everyone else. A Sunday night in Saudi Arabia, 6,600km from home and Real Madrid had just been beaten in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/15/gavi-helps-barcelona-ease-past-real-madrid-to-win-spanish-super-cup">final of the Spanish Super Cup</a>. Not just beaten, broken – and by Barcelona. It had finished 3-1 and the one flattered them. “We’re hurt,” the Madrid coach insisted, “but Madrid will come back.”</p><p>They always do: the question was how. Second in La Liga, Madrid’s players had returned from the World Cup and, repeatedly rescued by Thibaut Courtois, needed two goals in the last seven minutes to defeat struggling Valladolid. They then began 2023 with by scraping past fourth-tier Cacereño, 1-0 in the Copa del Rey, before <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/07/la-liga-villarreal-real-madrid-juventus-inter">losing 2-1 at Villarreal</a> in the league. They had only reached the Super Cup final on penalties against Valencia, Courtois saving them. And now this, taken apart: Barcelona-Madrid was, one headline had it, a Ferrari against a Twingo.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/28/its-the-start-of-a-new-era-ancelotti-plots-bright-future-for-real-madrid">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Kings Place; St John’s Smith Square, London; livestream</strong><br />Percussive thrills on all sides and live electronics 17th-century style meet a woodwind Mozart masterclass and Bournemouth’s answer to Cate Blanchett…</p><p>One definition of music, without heaving into a lecture, is “organised sound”. The title of the latest series at Kings Place, <a href="https://www.kingsplace.co.uk/whats-on/sound-unwrapped/">Sound Unwrapped</a>, could have applied to any of its 14 year-long editions to date. The 2023 season, impressive in its ambitions, burst into action last weekend with a sonic display of startling magnificence: the four drummers of the <strong><a href="https://www.colincurrie.com/news/2018/8/3/colin-currie-quartet#:~:text=The%20group%20is%20made%20up,by%20that%20highly%20influential%20force.">Colin Currie Quartet</a></strong>, cast asunder like the four winds, performed from each corner of Hall One’s gallery. The air reverberated, around and above. A streamlined, <a href="https://venues.arup.com/kings-place-rec/kings-place-rec">pale-oak auditorium</a> of the 21st century became a place of arcane code and ancient ritual.</p><p>The work was John Luther Adams’s <em>Qilyaun</em> (1998). A listener may not know, less care, that it is written as a four-part canon and a palindrome. The title refers to an Alaska shaman’s drum, a vehicle for spirit journeys. All that mattered, in the moment, was the way the rolls and rumbles ebbed and flowed, now louder, now softer, as if thunder had travelled between each bass drum, each set of sticks, each dazzling player. As well as Currie himself, the quartet comprises Owen Gunnell, Adrian Spillett and Sam Walton.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/28/colin-currie-quartet-dark-full-ride-kings-place-review-sound-unwrapped-liam-byrne-southbank-sinfonia-st-johns-smith-square-nicholas-daniel-bournemouth-symphony-orchestra-wigglesworth-guy-johnston-elgar-bruckner-seven">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A vegan take on the classic Greek dessert</p><p>I ate this cake many years ago when I dated a teacher who was passionate about Greek food. I didn’t fall in love with him, but I thoroughly enjoyed the cake. It had about it a taste of home, and of <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/may/22/baking-milk-recipes-torta-tres-leches-gulab-jamun">gulab jamun</a></em>, because of the syrup that soaks deep into the batter. It’s dense, like pudding, but also very bright with the flavour of January oranges. In fact, it tasted of what one might hope for in a beautiful partnership: brightness and a feeling of home. My liaison with this cake outlasted the teacher, and for that I’m not sorry.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/28/meera-sodha-recipe-vegan-portokalopita-greek-orange-cake">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The majority of Americans have resigned themselves to accepting policing as it currently exists. This must change</p><p>On 7 January, police in Memphis beat Tyre Nichols so badly as to send him into a days-long death to which he ultimately succumbed on 10 January. The beating of Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man, was so brutal that even law enforcement officials at both the city and state level – usually reliable sources for blaming the victims of police violence for the violence done to them – have declared it a heinous act. The five officers who beat Nichols, all of whom happen to also be Black, currently sit in jail on second-degree murder charges for what they did to him. Nichols is at least the eightieth person killed by police in the US so far this year.</p><p>Nearly two years ago, The Guardian asked me to write about the trial of Derek Chauvin for his murder of George Floyd. At the time, my estimation of the trial’s significance – and of the conviction that seemed likely at the time and that ultimately came to pass – is that it would be minimal. After all, I more or less argued at the time, you can send Derek Chauvin to prison for being violent, but doing so doesn’t change the institution that trained him to be violent, paid him to be violent, and paid him to train others to be violent.</p><p>Simon Balto is assistant professor of African American history at the University of Iowa.

<p>In December 1976, Patti and Griff Thomas were found dead at their Welsh farmhouse. The police said it was a murder-suicide. But locals say the evidence doesn’t add up …</p><p>The weathered headstones on the gently sloping hillside of Rhydwilym cemetery in Pembrokeshire, south-west Wales, are smothered in ivy and lichen, mostly long forgotten. But one among them is stark and unmissable, with bright gold lettering on sharp black granite. Martha Mary Thomas, whom everyone called Patti, and her older brother, Griffith Morris Thomas, known as Griff, lived together at the farmhouse of Ffynnon Samson, in nearby Llangolman. They died there together, on 7 December 1976, when Patti was 70 and Griff was 73. They are buried together, in the same grave. On the day I visit, someone has left a posy of pink flowers for them, flattened against the dark stone by the driving rain.</p><p>Neither Patti nor Griff had married. They remained at Ffynnon Samson, the Thomas family home, all their lives. Their father died in 1967, leaving them alone together when they were in their 60s. The farm had earned them a good living, but they lived frugally on their pensions, spending their time at Rhydwilym chapel, and looking after their garden.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/28/the-killer-could-still-be-among-us-two-elderly-siblings-and-a-brutal-that-mystifies-locals-nearly-50-years-on">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Dark obsession dominates in films about music. By contrast Spielberg captures the playfulness of cinema and storytelling</p><p>For a film that has, if you want to be blunt about it, <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt14444726/?ref_=bo_rl_ti">tanked at the box office</a>, Tár has provoked a disproportionate amount of conversation. It’s possible that the discourse around the film – about a powerful, highly successful and extremely problematic conductor called Lydia Tár, played by Cate Blanchett – is as interesting as the film itself.</p><p>I’ve heard multiple, conflicting interpretations of Tár: that it’s a disgraceful misrepresentation of the field of classical music; that it’s all too real; that it’s all too surreal; that it carries an intellectual heft that is rare at the movies; that it’s not half as clever as it thinks it is; that it’s not about conducting, it’s about power; that it’s not about power, it’s about narcissism; that it’s about a <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2023/01/19/the-instrumentalist-tar-todd-field-zadie-smith/">clash of ethics</a> between the generations; that it’s about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/24/tar-film-cate-blanchett-controversy-feminism">third-wave feminism</a>; that its central character, in all her “unlikeability”, is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/16/monstrous-maestro-cate-blanchett-cancel-culture-tar">arrestingly complex</a>; that its central character is irredeemably hateful; that it’s a fascinating, even-handed anatomisation of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/oct/26/tar-movie-cate-blanchett-digital-cancel-culture">“cancel culture”</a>; that it is actually a “regressive” movie that takes “bitter aim” at identity politics. Then there is an extensive <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2022/12/tar-cate-blanchett-movie-ending-explained-analyzed.html">online debate</a> devoted to decoding its eerie final act.

## Blake Morrison: Memoirists like me are accused of being mercenary and opportunistic

<p>After writing books about his father and his mother, Blake Morrison swore he didn’t have another memoir in him. Then his sister died, and he couldn’t escape the urge to tell her story</p><p>If you’re reading this, my sister is dead. I may be dead too, but that’s beside the point, for you if not for me. Many years ago I resolved not to write about her while she was alive, or rather not to publish anything that I had written. She – Gill – had walk-on parts, like a film extra, in two memoirs I published about our parents: And When Did You Last See Your Father? in 1993, and Things My Mother Never Told Me in 2002. That’s all it was: the odd look-in or passing mention. There was plenty to be said but not yet. Even if she had given me carte blanche, the page would have stayed blank. You can’t write an honest memoir when the subject is alive. At any rate I can’t. Death is the only permission.</p><p>After those books about Mum and Dad came out, I was sometimes asked if I had another memoir in me. No, I’d reply, I write fiction these days because I’ve run out of family. Once or twice I answered even more facetiously: I don’t know if I’ve another memoir in me but my sister’s quaking in her boots. There’s an assumption that to write honestly about someone is an act of aggression; that’s the gallery I was playing to. But I felt no aggression towards Gill – didn’t then and don’t now. She’s gone, that’s all, and though there’s no retrieving her I’d like to make sense of who she was and what she became. It wasn’t just that she changed over time. She could change from day to day. Drink made it worse but the origins went deeper. You never knew which you’d get, the kind and loving Gill or her doppelganger. Two sisters.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/28/blake-morrison-memoirists-like-me-are-accused-of-being-mercenary-and-opportunistic">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Before heading to South Africa for the Women’s T20 World Cup, England’s captain is fired up by the WPL and a home Ashes series</p><p>The Women’s T20 World Cup is fast approaching and yet the Women’s Premier League that follows it in March is the talk of the town. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/16/womens-indian-premier-league-agrees-95m-broadcast-rights-deal-cricket">Television rights sold for £95m</a> with players set to earn in excess of six figures. This Indian revolution, to use a cliche, will be a gamechanger.</p><p>Looking on at its formation with interest is the England captain, Heather Knight, and for a couple of reasons. Not only will the 32-year-old’s name be in the forthcoming auction – an unimaginable scenario when she started playing boy’s cricket at Plymstock CC in Devon, aged eight – but because it is a topic she knows better than most.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/28/heather-knight-watching-lionesses-was-remarkable-england-cricket">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Rice three ways: a savoury ‘porridge’ topped with spicy oil and stir-fried Chinese leaves, a layered dish of tamarind-infused grains, chana dal and aromatic oil, and pumpkin rice fritters with chilli soured cream</p><p>I’m often asked what my most comforting meal is, of which there are many, and rice always makes it into the top five. Yes, I find comfort in the way it tastes, but it’s also the aroma of rice cooking – that distinct smell of home, which is equal parts sweet and savoury – that warms me up from the inside out. If I’m hungry but short on time, I often make a steaming pot of rice, stir through some butter and cheese and not much else, and still relish every bite. When time is on my side, however, I’ll give rice a more superstar treatment: from porridge to pilaf to fritter, here are just three of the many ways to cook with one of my favourite ingredients.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/28/rice-recipes-jook-congee-porridge-tamarind-chana-dal-pumpkin-fritters-yotam-ottolenghi">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The young author’s debut graphic novel brings magic to modern Cairo in an imaginative story of grief, faith and urban life</p><p>The three bottles sit in a cushioned box behind the instant noodles and cold drinks on offer at Shokry’s Cairo convenience stall, their ornate script and stamp of origin – “1954, Italia” – indicating something special. These are “first-class” wishes, the finest money can buy, capable of curing disease, creating great riches or bringing dinosaurs to life. So why has no one bought them yet?</p><p>The buzz around Deena Mohamed has been growing since 2013 when, aged 18, she started posting a bold and funny webcomic called Qahera about a “hijabi superhero” who clashes with everyone from hypocritical elders to western feminists. Her ambitious debut graphic novel will set her stock still higher. Published in Egypt in three volumes between 2017 and 2021, it has been translated by Mohamed herself and collected in one chunky English-language hardback. Read from right to left like the Arabic original, this compelling urban fantasy sees three regulars to Shokry’s stall grapple with the implications of their wish-making.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/28/your-wish-is-my-command-by-deena-mohamed-review-a-spellbinding-fantasy-from-egypt">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The actor is putting all her experiences into an Oscar-nominated turn as the director’s formidable mother. She talks about the dramatic changes she’s witnessed in Hollywood and beyond</p><p>Michelle Williams is apologising for the camera angle. She’s cross-legged on a bed and her iPhone keeps slipping down the pillows. Sometimes all I see is the duvet, sometimes something more mysterious. “It’s hard to find a place to put this,” she says. “I don’t want to breastfeed you.”</p><p>It’s 7am in Palm Springs, California. Last night, Williams was at a film gala. This morning, she’s been up for two hours already. “I thought I would be super-accomplished and do this before he [the baby] woke, but he’s jet-lagged and already woke at five.” Williams’ son was born last October; his brother, Hart, is two-and-a-half. Their father is Williams’ husband, the director Thomas Kail; she also has a 17-year-old, Matilda, from her relationship with the actor Heath Ledger.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/28/michelle-williams-interview-the-fabelmans-spielberg-metoo-money">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A highly salacious story lies behind footage of a diamond chain-wearing German shepherd on his private jet. But this series’s desperation to create memes risks undermining its entire genre</p><p>Documentaries used to be easy: a shot of a guy with facial hair driving his car; some sort of Expo where people are behaving oddly; a pop-punk song that’s a bit on the nose; and a doomed attempt to set up a legacy celebrity. That’s what I used to like: grainy film footage, fuzzes of sound, filming on a windy day. Ideally, it would win an award from an academy you have never heard of. Michael Moore would turn up at some point wearing a big T-shirt and a hat.</p><p>This is no longer the case Documentaries are big business now, with budgets and cachet. This has ruined documentaries for a cultural cycle (if I were to guess, this era of documentary will last about seven years – starting with 2019’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jan/14/fyre-netflix-documentary-festival-disaster-review">Fyre</a> – so they’ll be normal again around 2026). The language of documentary has changed because the audience has changed: everyone who willingly appears in a documentary now knows they are one snappy soundbite away from being the Fyre Festival Bottled Water Guy or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/05/carole-baskin-tiger-king-faces-of-2020">Carole Baskin From Tiger King</a>. Essentially, documentaries used to have a whiff of homework about them, a certain librarial dorkiness, and now they are for everyone. This is good in one way (more people watching documentaries!) and very, very bad in another (more people watching documentaries). It will be impossible to make a true documentary in an era when millions of people watch them on Netflix, because everyone participating in them – everyone who appears on camera, smoothing down their shirt and asking if their mic pack works OK – knows they are this close to being 2023’s first meme. Nobody speaks normally when they are trying to become a gif.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/28/gunthers-millions-could-this-tale-of-a-multi-millionaire-dog-kill-the-documentary-for-good">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Avocado fries can turn an under-ripe avocado into an unexpectedly delicious party piece</p><p>The avocado has a large carbon footprint and extremely seductive texture, so no wonder it has become such an infamous commodity, especially considering it’s often wasted due to a short shelf life. If you’re a climavore who wants to eat for the planet, but avocados are still a must, eat them less often, as a special treat, and use European-grown and organic ones whenever possible.</p><p>Most importantly, though, don’t waste them. Avocados labelled as “ready to eat” cost more and are often overripe. That said, it can be tricky to ripen them yourself at home, but if you ever find yourself landed with an inedible, rock-hard avocado, it can still be saved – try ripening it alongside a banana, say –the ethene released by the banana will help ripen any fruit by converting its starches to sugars – or turn it into avocado fries, which are an unexpectedly delicious surprise that can convert an underripe avocado into a fun weekend dish or party piece.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/28/avocados-refuse-to-ripen-turn-them-into-fries-zero-waste-cooking">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Whether it’s Steven Spielberg’s heartfelt homage to his salad days or some cheeky, and rather dapper, chuckles, our critics have you covered for the next seven days</p><p><strong>The Fabelmans<br /></strong><em>Out now</em><strong><br /></strong>Steven Spielberg excavates his childhood anxieties about his parents’ failing marriage to construct a semi-autobiographical drama detailing his early years as a would-be film-maker.

<p><strong>Allendale, Northumberland:</strong> It brings promise every winter at around this time, twisting around branches and becoming just as fat</p><p>My boots are clarty with mud by the time I get home. So many walks this winter have been trudges like that, straddling runnels, using field rush as stepping stones, feeling weighted down by sticky earth. In the relentless brown of the woods I yearn for greenery and seek out small dabs of colour. The emerald velvet of moss beneath a tree, fronds of hard fern, trefoils of wood sorrel high in the cleft of an ash sapling.</p><p>It is honeysuckle leaves that have cheered me most. These delicate-looking shoots of floppy spring green first sprouted on tangled vines in December. It’s the normal time for them to emerge and something that brings promise to every winter. They leaf up early, before the canopy spreads on the trees. Honeysuckle roots grow in the damp humus of woodlands, but the plant’s twisting lianas climb using the trees for support, carrying their leaves and flowers closer to the light.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/28/country-diary-honeysuckle-twines-its-way-towards-the-light">Continue reading...</a>
