To celebrate the launch of the latest game, Fire Emblem Engage, here is the history of Fire Emblem.", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/disney-dreamlight-valley-all-character-houses/2900-4574/", "title": "Disney Dreamlight Valley: All Character Houses", "date_published": "2023-01-28 14:00:00+00:00", "description": "<p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4085017-disney-fishing.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/disney-dreamlight-valley/\">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a> is overflowing with stuff to do, but few things are as satisfying as <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-how-to-unlock-all-characters/1100-6507527/\">making new friends</a> and adding them to your own world. Meeting the various Disney characters in Dreamlight Valley requires a bit of work on your part, of course, asking you to travel to beloved realms, complete quests, and invite them back to live in the valley. But once you get them there, it's always worth the effort.</p><p>Most characters you encounter will have a home that you can place in any of the game's biomes, giving you an opportunity to decide where they'll be living out their lives in the valley. Whether you want to have a dedicated neighborhood full of homes or spread everyone out across different areas, the choice is entirely up to you--at least once you've paid Scrooge McDuck some coins to build the home, that is.</p><p>Granted, not every character has a buildable home. Some characters already have homes in the valley at the start of the game, such as Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, and Merlin. Others will take up residence in pre-existing structures, such as Mother Gothel's cursed tree in the Glade of Trust or Elsa's ice cave in the Forest of Valor. Additionally, the requirements for bringing some of these beloved friends to your valley may be a little bit difficult to figure out at times, asking you to complete objectives or find special items. Such is the case with <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-how-to-unlock-all-characters/1100-6507527/\">Prince Eric</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-how-to-unlock-all-characters/1100-6507527/\">Stitch</a>, especially--both of whom take quite a bit more effort than usual.</p><p>We've decided to take a stroll around the valley and snap some shots of each character's home so that you can get a look at what to expect when you befriend each of them. Hopefully, it'll give you an idea of who you'd like to prioritize unlocking first and where you may want to place their dwelling based on the aesthetics of the structure. Either way, enjoy this look at all of the characters' houses currently in Dreamlight Valley.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Mickey's House</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4085078-disneydreamlightvalley_20230110143120.jpg\" /></p><br />     <p><h2>Minnie's House</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4085079-disneydreamlightvalley_20230110143052.jpg\" /></p><br />     <p><h2>Goofy's House</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4085080-disneydreamlightvalley_20230110143107.jpg\" /></p><br />     <p><h2>Merlin's House</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4085081-disneydreamlightvalley_20230110143216.jpg\" /></p><br />     <p><h2>Donald's House</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4085082-disneydreamlightvalley_20230110142328.jpg\" /></p><br />     <p><h2>Mother Gothel's House</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4085083-disneydreamlightvalley_20230110142837.jpg\" /></p><br />     <p><h2>WALL-E's House</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4085084-disneydreamlightvalley_20230110143139.jpg\" /></p><br />     <p><h2>Ariel's House</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4085085-disneydreamlightvalley_20230110142425.jpg\" /></p><br />     <p><h2>Prince Eric's House</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4085086-disneydreamlightvalley_20230110142352.jpg\" /></p><br />     <p><h2>Ursula's House</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4085087-disneydreamlightvalley_20230110142512.jpg\" /></p><br />     <p><h2>Remy's House</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4085088-disneydreamlightvalley_20230110143022.jpg\" /></p><br />     <p><h2>Scar's House</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4085089-disneydreamlightvalley_20230110143242.jpg\" /></p><br />     <p><h2>Elsa's House</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4085090-disneydreamlightvalley_20230110142545.jpg\" /></p><br />     <p><h2>Anna and Kristoff's House</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4085091-disneydreamlightvalley_20230110142603.jpg\" /></p><br />     <p><h2>Stitch's House</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4085092-disneydreamlightvalley_20230110142406.jpg\" /></p><br />     <p><h2>Woody's House</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4085093-disneydreamlightvalley_20230110142248.jpg\" /></p><br />     <p><h2>Buzz's House</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4085094-disneydreamlightvalley_20230110143040.jpg\" /></p><br />     <p><h2>Moana's House</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4085095-disneydreamlightvalley_20230110142313.jpg\" /></p><br />     <p><h2>Maui's House</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4085096-disneydreamlightvalley_20230110142300.jpg\" /></p><br />", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/videos/we-played-2-hours-of-like-a-dragon-ishin/2300-6460500/", "title": "We Played 2 Hours of Like a Dragon: Ishin!", "date_published": "2023-01-28 01:12:00+00:00", "description": "<img height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1352/13527689/4092557-lodishin_site.jpg\" width=\"480\" /> The western release of Like a Dragon: Ishin is a curious proposition.

Zabu is a 3-Cost card with 2-Power and has a powerful Ongoing effect that reduces the cost of 4-Cost cards in hand by 2.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This essentially allows, on turn six for example, to play up to three 4-Cost cards with Zabu on the board due to their reduced cost from its continuous effect. This Ongoing effect can also be multiplied with Onslaught, Mystique, or Onslaught\u2019s Citadel location. The only downside of this reduction is the 4-Cost cards are capped to costing at least one energy. They will never reach 0-Cost territory through Zabu\u2019s usage specifically.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Season Pass cards are always especially powerful, since they, like Zabu, can only be unlocked for the time being by purchasing the roughly $15 Premium Pass. This guide will cover a few of the best Zabu-based decks, and even if you are not the type of player to purchase Marvel Snap\u2019s season passes, these decks will still be worth checking out in the future when you do obtain the inevitable Zabu due to the game\u2019s card rollout system.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-snap-decks-best-zabu-decks/1100-6510954/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}], "source": {"url": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "GameSpot"}}
