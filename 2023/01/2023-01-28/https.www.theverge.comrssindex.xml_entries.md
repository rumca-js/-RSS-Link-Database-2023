  <p id="n74LlB">Following years of lobbying from Washington, Japan and the Netherlands agreed on Friday to tighten restrictions on the export of chip manufacturing technology to Chinese companies. News of the agreement was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-27/japan-netherlands-to-join-us-in-chip-export-controls-on-china?sref=ExbtjcSG">reported b</a><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-27/biden-wins-deal-with-dutch-japan-on-china-chip-export-controls?leadSource=uverify%20wall&amp;sref=ExbtjcSG">y</a><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-27/japan-netherlands-to-join-us-in-chip-export-controls-on-china?sref=ExbtjcSG"> <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/baa27f42-0557-4377-839b-a4f4524cfa20"><em>Financial Times</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/28/business/economy/netherlands-japan-china-chips.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.</p>
<p id="Rf5rlj">The controls are designed to limit China’s ability to ramp up its own domestic chip production and come after the Biden administration <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/7/23392860/biden-semiconductor-chips-intel-micron-china-ohio-science">announced similar restrictions in October 2022</a>. The fear is that easier access to advanced semiconductors will allow China to shore up its military and artificial intelligence capabilities. </p>

## Capcom’s major Street Fighter 5 tournament ditches PlayStation consoles for PCs

  <p id="PWIV8g">Capcom will exclusively use PCs to power its upcoming Capcom Cup tournament, which has the world’s top <em>Street Fighter 5 </em>players battling it out for a $300,000 prize pool. In <a href="https://twitter.com/CapcomFighters/status/1618371053599981568?s=20&amp;t=KXlmWseA5cZBajhXtITbWw">a post on Twitter</a>, Capcom Fighters says all matches will be played on PCs with the displays set to 144Hz.</p>
<p id="imtRQL">The company doesn’t provide any information on the hardware going into these PCs (or if they’ll just use gaming laptops), but the move’s expected to reduce input lag — the time it takes for a system to translate your button press on a keyboard or controller to an action displayed on the screen. Low input lag is a necessity for pros in the fighting game scene, where a delayed punch or kick can greatly affect the outcome of a match. </p>

  <p id="YY4b62">Google researchers have made an AI that can generate minutes-long musical pieces from text prompts, and can even transform a whistled or hummed melody into other instruments, similar to how <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/28/23376328/ai-art-image-generator-dall-e-access-waitlist-scrapped">systems like DALL-E</a> generate images from written prompts (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/27/google-created-an-ai-that-can-generate-music-from-text-descriptions-but-wont-release-it/">via <em>TechCrunch</em></a>). The model is called MusicLM, and while you can’t play around with it for yourself, the company has <a href="https://google-research.github.io/seanet/musiclm/examples/">uploaded a bunch of samples</a> that it produced using the model.</p>
<p id="1wtiRg">The examples are impressive. There are 30-second snippets of what sound like actual songs created from paragraph-long descriptions that prescribe a genre, vibe, and even specific instruments, as well as five-minute-long pieces generated from one or two words like “melodic techno.” Perhaps my favorite is a demo of “story...</p>

  <p id="dqxMGA">Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1619125419827134467?s=20">is promising</a> that it’ll take “less severe actions” when disciplining accounts that break its rules; it’ll only suspend Twitter accounts that engage in “severe or ongoing, repeat violations” of its rules. The company <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1619125112716005376?t=0Z5gcwPtUvHMK6J29S6JOg&amp;s=19">also says</a> it’ll be letting anyone appeal suspensions starting February 1st, and that those doing so will be judged using updated standards.</p>
<p id="lh8Ltv">What will Twitter do instead of suspending your account? The “less severe actions” are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180226140606/https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/enforcement-options">things that Twitter has been doing for years</a>, such as limiting visibility of a tweet, or telling a user to remove a tweet before they can get back onto the site. Today’s change is that Twitter is promising to reach for those tools more often, instead of going straight for the ban button. </p>
