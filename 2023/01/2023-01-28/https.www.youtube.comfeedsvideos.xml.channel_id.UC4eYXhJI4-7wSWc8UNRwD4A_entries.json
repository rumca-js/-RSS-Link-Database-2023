The globalFEST team wrote the following biographical information about each performer.\n\nCui Jian, China\nThe most influential rock musician in China is Beijing-born, multi-instrumentalist, songwriter, and vocalist Cui Jian. The former leader of Chinese rock band Ado, Jian's solo music is continually embraced by new generations: his albums having sold more than 10 million copies in Asia. The Wall Street Journal said, \"Cui Jian continues to be an inspiration for China's disenchanted youth.\" However, Jian's prime inspiration comes not from politics, but from personal issues. He said, \"I talk about serious things in my heart and people's lives, including, of course, love. But, mostly it's about Chinese culture, the modern culture. They're not political songs. It's just the truth, the modern truth. I talk about our life in China.\" \n\nSET LIST\n\"Fake Monk\"\n\"Go On\"\n\"Wild in the Snow\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nCui Jian: lead vocals, guitar\nLiu Yuan: saxophone\nEddie Randriamampionona: guitar\nLiu Yue: bass \nLu Chao: drums\nGao Xing: hand percussion\nWu Na: Chinese guqin\nZhou Tian: vocals\nLi Yanan: vocals\n\nCREDITS\nArt Director: Cui Jian\nExecutive Producer: Yoyo\nExecutive Director: Ken Deng\nLive Music Recording Engineer: Li Feng\nLive Music Supervisor: Wang Zheng\nLive Recordist: Zheng Xiaofei\nProgram: Wang Zheng\nLive Monitor Sound Engineer: Xu Xuan\nAudio Equipment Coordinator: Wang Chaojie\nSound Mixing/Mastering: Li Make\nMusician Assistants: Yang Haitao, Gao Shuo\nVideographers: Ken Deng, Li Bingwei, Xu Zhu, Li Qianpeng, Jiao Mingjie, Jin Siwei \nAssistant: He Chang\nGaffer: Sun Qunliang\nAssistant: Sun Xujie, Cao Yawei, Wang Xinqiao, Cao Junfei\nCoordinator: Wang Zebin, Sira \nSpecial thanks to East Shore Jazz Club\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nCreative Director: Bob Boilen \nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin \nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter \nEditing: Joshua Bryant\nTiny Desk Team: Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Ashley Pointer\n\nGLOBALFEST TEAM\nCo-Directors: Shanta Thake, Isabel Soffer, and Bill Bragin\n2023 Curators: Shanta Thake, Isabel Soffer, Bill Bragin, and Meera Dugal\nEvent Producer: Ian Thake\nHost: Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo\nLegal Services: Tamizdat\nLegal Services: Duane Morris\nVideo Production: Karim Tabbaa\n\nFUNDERS:\nThe Mellon Foundation\nThe National Endowment for the Arts\nNYC Department of Cultural Affairs\n\nSPECIAL THANKS:\nKen Umezaki\nFabian Alsultany\nSteven Kirkpatrick\nDavid Komar", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdMMKAVFp1k", "title": "Dakh Daughters: Tiny Desk Meets globalFEST 2023", "date_published": "2023-01-28 10:00:19+00:00", "description": "For the third year, Tiny Desk concerts team up with globalFEST for a thrilling online music festival \u2014 Tiny Desk meets globalFEST.\n\nBob Boilen | January 27, 2023\nHosted by Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo, the series echoes globalFEST\u2019s live flagship event in spirit but is centered in the framework of the Tiny Desk concert series.
