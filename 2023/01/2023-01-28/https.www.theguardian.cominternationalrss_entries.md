## Refree: El Espacio Entre review – Barcelona producer’s haunting minimalism

<p>(Glitterbeat)<br />Worked up from two film soundtracks, this atmospheric concept album features piano, guitar, Monteverdi and radio static</p><p>Commissioned to write the soundtrack for a restored print of <em>The Cursed Village</em>, a classic of Spanish silent cinema, Barcelona’s <a href="https://www.raulrefree.com/">Raül Refree</a> decided to extend the film’s bleak atmosphere and theme of displacement on <a href="https://idol-io.link/ElEspacioEntre">this concept album</a>, which translates as <em>The Space Between</em>. Having started out in the 1990s in hardcore bands (Barcelona Corn Flakes), Refree has become prolific as both producer and composer. Here he incorporates pieces from another soundtrack, for <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5_MID2Ao1Q">Un año, una noche</a></em> (2022), a film about a traumatised couple who survived the terrorist attack on Paris’s Bataclan theatre.</p><p>Lightness and joy are clearly not the moods being explored, but the combination of minimalist piano compositions such as Las Migraciones Nocturnas and more experimental excursions proves potent. The standouts are Refree’s treatments of classical madrigals. Monteverdi’s Lamento della ninfa is reworked, its female soprano voice shimmering ghost-like among strings. There are reflective Hispanic guitar pieces such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA4xtjz1afU">Lo que esconden</a>, a doleful choir on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwVekyF35zs">Lamentos de un día cualquiera</a>, and on La radio en la cocina a spar between acoustic guitar and radio static. With its assorted styles and pieces lasting between 30 seconds and five minutes, the album’s diversity is also its shortcoming, albeit from a fascinating creator. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/28/raul-refree-el-espacio-entre-review-barcelona-producer-haunting-minimalism">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The self-titled ‘queen of double faults’ began with that self-inflicted wound but finished with an astounding turnaround</p><p>Aryna Sabalenka started the final with a double fault and ended on the ground sobbing. It was, in a way, the story of her previous 12 months. Last year, the Belarusian was the self-described “queen of double faults” – a tour-high 440 of them last season. She also operated at the behest of her own emotions, stripped of her agency when confronted with an opponent’s defiance.</p><p>She became a champion on Saturday because she bested both – and, in turn, Elena Rybakina. She brought herself to heel after losing the first set and after each of the 10 break points she engineered but did not win.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/28/sabalenkas-storybook-comeback-amazes-in-australian-open-triumph">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Globes or little massage sticks that you keep in the freezer work magic on a bloated face – and can get quite addictive</p><p>The degree of my facial puffiness seems commensurate with my age. The older I get, the greater my natural morning bloat. I’ve tried stacks of gels, masks and lotions, all designed to de-puff – and indeed, my intention this week was to recommend a couple of them here. But I can’t in all honesty, because although some can occasionally help, I still believe one gets better and more satisfying results from a massage tool, which has the additional benefit of never running out.</p><p>You’ll have seen some, I’m sure. “<a href="https://shop.fraicheur.com/fraicheur/product">Cryoglobes</a>” are all the rage. These are glass orbs filled with gel that you keep in pairs in the freezer, ready for a basic facial self-massage. The idea is that the combination of light pressure (believed to encourage the drainage of fluids) and low temperature will reduce the puffiness common to morning – or morning after – eyes and cheeks.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jan/28/creams-and-gels-dont-really-solve-puffiness-try-a-simple-cold-massage-instead">Continue reading...</a>

<p>These clubs have a long and storied rivalry. Who will emerge victorious at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona on Sunday?</p><p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/drhbell">Henry Bell</a> for <a href="https://www.gentlemanultra.com/">The Gentleman Ultra</a></p><p>Napoli are flying high at the top of the Serie A table and Roma are in scintillating form, having put together a six-game unbeaten run that dates back to November. The nascent strike partnership between Tammy Abraham and Paulo Dybala is lighting up the Stadio Olimpico, which hitherto had to endure José Mourinho parking his bus. With Napoli desperate to win their first Scudetto since 1990 and Roma vying for a Champions League place, the Derby del Sole on Sunday – the latest meeting in this 97-year rivalry – is not a game to be missed.</p><p>Napoli and Roma have been entertaining fans since their first meeting in 1928, which Roma won 4-1. Even the name, translated as “derby of the sun”, has a poetic richness to it. The reality of the rivalry has often been less pleasant than that nickname suggests, though. Relations between the two sets of fans are at a low, after <a href="https://football-italia.net/video-roma-and-napoli-fans-clash-on-motorway/">clashes between rival fans in January</a> dominated the headlines in the Italian press. While travelling in buses to games in different parts of the country, the fans spotted each other and exchanged rocks, bottles and fireworks on a motorway.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/the-gentleman-ultra/2023/jan/28/napoli-roma-derby-del-sole-heats-title-diego-maradona">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Fresh wave of Russian attacks in east and south Ukraine kill at least 10 civilians; troops locked in ‘fierce’ fighting for Donetsk town of Vugledar</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">See all our Russia-Ukraine war coverage</a></li></ul><p><strong>A new barrage of Russian shelling has killed at least 10 Ukrainian civilians and wounded 20 others in a day</strong>, the office of Ukraine’s president has said. Regional officials said towns and villages in the east and in the south that are within reach of the Russian artillery suffered most. Six people died in the Donetsk region, two in Kherson and two in the Kharkiv region, the officials said.</p><p>A day earlier, Russian-fired missiles and self-propelled drones were reported to have <strong>hit deeper into Ukrainian territory, killing at least 11 people</strong>.</p><p><strong>Ukrainian troops were locked in “fierce” fighting with Russian forces</strong> <strong>on Friday for control of the town of Vugledar</strong>, south-west of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. Both sides claimed success in the small administrative centre, a short distance from the strategic prize of the village of Pavlivka, Agence France-Presse reported. “Soon, Vugledar may become a new, very important success for us,” Denis Pushilin, the Moscow-appointed leader of the Donetsk region, was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies. But Kyiv said the town remained contested.</p><p><strong>Volodymyr Zelenskiy has described the situation on the frontline as “extremely acute”</strong>, particularly in the eastern Donetsk region, where Russia is stepping up its offensive. The Ukrainian president reported major battles for Vuhledar and Bakhmut, to the north-east. Local Ukrainian officials reported heavy shelling in the north, north-east and east.</p><p><strong>Ukraine’s army claims to have killed 109 Russian soldiers and wounded another 188 in one day during fighting around Vuhledar. </strong>Serhii Cherevatyi, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian armed forces’ eastern operational command, said the death toll was recorded on Thursday, adding: “Fierce fighting is ongoing. The enemy is indeed trying to achieve an intermediate success there, but thanks to the efforts of our defenders, they are unsuccessful.”</p><p><strong>Poland will send an additional 60 tanks to Ukraine</strong> on top of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/24/poland-requests-german-permission-to-send-leopard-tanks-to-ukraine">14 German-made Leopard 2 tanks it has already pledged</a>, the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has told CTV News.</p><p><strong>A total of 321 heavy tanks have been promised to Ukraine by several countries, Ukraine’s ambassador to France said</strong> on Friday. Vadym Omelchenko told French TV station BFM that “delivery terms vary for each case and we need this help as soon as possible”, while not specifying the number of tanks per country.</p><p><strong>Belgium announced an additional €93.6m ($104.7m/£84.5m) package in military aid </strong>for Ukraine in what the Belgian prime minister, Alexander De Croo, said was – including previous spending – the largest of its kind Belgium had ever given another country.</p><p><strong>Ukraine says it is setting up drone assault companies</strong> within its armed forces that will be equipped with Starlink satellite communications, as it presses ahead with an idea to build up an “army of drones”, Reuters reported. Commander-in-chief Valeriy Zaluzhnyi signed off on the creation of the units in a project that would involve several ministries and agencies, the general staff said.</p><p><strong>Ten regions of Ukraine are instituting emergency power outages</strong> due to a power shortage in the network after Thursday’s Russian attacks, Ukraine’s state broadcaster has reported. Repairs to damaged facilities are continuing.</p><p><strong>The Kremlin claims Joe Biden has the key to end the conflict in Ukraine by directing Kyiv to settle but has not been willing to use it. </strong>“The key to the Kyiv regime is largely in the hands of Washington,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Friday. “Now we see that the current White House leader ... does not want to use this key. On the contrary, he chooses the path of further pumping weapons into Ukraine.” Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova accused Washington of engaging in a “hybrid war” against Moscow.</p><p><strong>The European Union wants swift accountability for “horrific” crimes in Ukraine</strong>, EU justice ministers have said after meeting in Stockholm. But the member states differ over how to bring prosecutions, seek evidence or fund war damage repairs. .</p><p><strong>Hungary will veto any European Union sanctions against Russia affecting nuclear energy,</strong> the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, told state radio on Friday.</p><p><strong>Russia is violating the “fundamental principles of child protection” in wartime </strong>by giving Ukrainian children Russian passports and putting them up for adoption, the head of the UN’s refugee agency, Filippo Grandi, has said.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/28/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-339-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>
