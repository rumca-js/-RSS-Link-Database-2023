Their newest ad now features a topless trans-identified model with scars from their gender-affirming double <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jordan-peterson-twitter-elliot-page" target="_blank">mastectomy</a>.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201c.@Burberry\u2019s latest ad is promoting young physically healthy women getting double mastectomies.\u201d</div> — Libs of TikTok (@Libs of TikTok)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/libsoftiktok/status/1618319599560462336">1674672434</a>
</blockquote>
<p>The ad is part of Burberry's new Valentine's campaign called "B:MINE". The feature of the surgical scars has prompted criticism that Burberry is glamorizing gender-transition procedures and could potentially negatively impact young girls. Or, Burberry is just trying to rack up some "wokeism" and "inclusivity" brownie points. Either way, the impact is the same. </p><p>Young girls are particularly susceptible to media messages and campaigns about their weight, style, looks, etc. And studies suggest transgenderism may be no different. </p><p>A 2018 paper <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/new-paper-ignites-storm-over-whether-teens-experience-rapid-onset-transgender-identity" target="_blank">published</a> in PLOS ONE found that social contagion could be a major factor in adolescent gender <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/fox-news-celebrates-transgender-teen" target="_blank">transitions</a>. Author Lisa Littman found among the adolescents reported on—83% of whom were biologically female—more than one-third had friendship groups in which 50% or more of the youths began to identify as transgender in a similar time frame.  </p><p>Abigail Shrier, author of "Irreversible Damage," argues that such social contagion has caused anxious, depressed young girls to turn to gender transition, when in another era they may have turned to anorexia or bulimia. She <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/06/27/how-peer-contagion-plays-into-the-rise-of-teens-transitioning/" target="_blank">wrote</a>, "A girl never expresses any discomfort with her biological sex until puberty, when anxiety and depression descend. The girl struggles to make friends. She immerses in social media and discovers transgender gurus. Or her school holds an assembly celebrating gender journeys or hosts a Gay-Straight Alliance club pushing gender ideology. At first, she tries out a new name and pronouns. Her school encourages her, keeping all this a secret from her parents. Then, she wants more."</p><p>If a young girl merely watching one of her peers transition could motivate her to transition herself, it's not a far leap to hypothesize that glamorizing transition surgeries in media could have the same impact. But hooray for inclusivity! </p><p><p>

<p>The NYC protestors also vandalized a Whole Foods to read, "RIP Tyre" and what looks like "Avenge Tort." Which at first deeply confused me, since this statement makes zero grammatical sense. But apparently "Tort" refers to Manuel "Tortuguita" Teran, who was killed by police during the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/atlanta-mayor-speaks-violence" target="_blank">Atlanta</a> protests.

<p>All in all, the riots could have been far, far worse. There weren't any flaming gas stations or 17-year-olds chased by convicted felons, to my knowledge. Always a plus. </p><p>The protests were held over the death of Tyre Nichols in Memphis, Tennessee. Nichols was allegedly stopped by five black male police officers for reckless driving. The bodycam footage of his arrest was released last night and appears to show a police chase before they brutally beat him for several minutes. </p><p>Nichols died in the hospital as a result of his injuries three days later. The five cops were charged on Thursday with second-degree murder, aggravated assault, two charges of aggravated kidnapping, two charges of official misconduct, and one charge of official oppression. </p><p>Nichols' mother spoke at a candlelight vigil on Thursday and urged peaceful protests in her son's name. </p><p><p>

## Team DeSantis exposes CNN's media malpractice as Gov accused of 'echoing decisions made by fascist dictators'

They cite an "expert" who called him a fascist dictator. Bryan Griffin, DeSantis' Press Secretary, was less than amused by the question. But it's an excuse to point out how corporate media journalismers suck at life, so let's play.</p><p>At issue is Gov. DeSantis challenging the curriculum of one specific AP African American history course. You see, DeSantis believes an African American history course should teach African American history. Marxists twats think the class should <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joy-reid-ron-desantis" target="_blank">teach white people to hate themselves</a> and<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/karine-jean-pierre-florida-history" target="_blank"> talk about who less than 3% of black people have sex with</a>. </p><p>America's Governor <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-history-class" target="_blank">had this to say</a>:</p><blockquote>We believe in teaching kids facts and how to think, but we don't believe they should have an agenda imposed on them.</blockquote><p>CNN disagrees with that statement. As does the alleged expert who believes DeSantis is echoing fascist dictators by *checks notes* thinking a history class should teach history. </p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">See below for this morning's activism from <a href="https://twitter.com/CNN?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CNN</a>. This isn't journalism--it's media malpractice.<br /><br />Taking a critic's dishonest position, legitimizing it with unnamed Experts™, & writing with a standard of 'guilty until proven innocent' does absolutely nothing to inform the public. <a href="https://t.co/gQYqvTwEyq">pic.twitter.com/gQYqvTwEyq</a><br />— Bryan Griffin (@BryanDGriffin) <a href="https://twitter.com/BryanDGriffin/status/1618998711887237121?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 27, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Keep in mind, to journalismers you only need to meet two requirements to be considered an expert. You have to be a person (professor, author, blogger...it doesn't matter) and you have to have the same political opinion as the journalismer creating content. When also else fails, a journalismer can select three random idiots who have the same dumb opinion on Twitter and form their "news" around that.</p><p>And you wonder why DeSantis <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-nyt" target="_blank">doesn't waste his time talking to corporate media</a>.</p><blockquote>Your inquiry is absurd and, of course, false. There will always be extreme critics, but it is the media's choice whether to give them a platform and legitimize their extremism. If this is what CNN considers journalism, it deserves to fail.</blockquote><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Response: <a href="https://t.co/CNYo5Z335M">pic.twitter.com/CNYo5Z335M</a><br />— Bryan Griffin (@BryanDGriffin) <a href="https://twitter.com/BryanDGriffin/status/1619002326840393728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 27, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>No word on what CNN.com is going to go with. "Team DeSantis refused to comment on the matter," or "Team DeSantis opposed me and my employers for being douchebags." I'm guessing the former.</p><p><p>

<p>What was remarkable about this video is the reaction of the school board. This isn't the first video we have <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/school-board-recommended-book" target="_blank">seen of a parent</a> reading <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/school-board-chicago-summer-reading" target="_blank">the photographic material</a> made <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/school-board-mother-son" target="_blank">available to students</a> in the name of equity, inclusion, or whatever other buzzwords get thrown around. The school boards always get defensive about it. Even ordering the parent to stop reading the book, because they deem it <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/school-board-filthy-book" target="_blank">inappropriate to be shared in such a setting</a>. Though your kid's classroom is okay.</p><p>In this case, at least two school board members converted back to parents and wanted this book removed immediately. Even as the Chairman started to go on about the process, one of the mothers responded "Nope! Get it out of schools."</p><p>Who I would like to see at these meetings is the teacher or teachers who read this book and determined to make it part of an English class curriculum. Hearing their rationale would be fascinating and quite a teachable moment before telling them they shouldn't be around children.</p><p><p>

## Watch: The Simpsons predict a media-induced 'phony baloney' public health scare in 2010 that sounds eerily familiar

<p>The irony here is the writers who wrote "fiction" like this (and the X-Files clip I linked to) about schmandemics and how easy it would be to scare people into a schmandemic come from the same political side of the isle where they light Fauci prayer candles and look down on YOU for questioning any of it. They also work for the major media companies that were assembled around that animated table.</p><p>It's hardly the first time <em>The Simpsons</em> has been credited for predicting the future.
