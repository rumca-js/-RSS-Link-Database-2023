MSNBC's <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joy-reid-ron-desantis\" target=\"_blank\">Joy Reid</a> went so far as to claim Governor Ron DeSantis might have enjoyed the fascist World War II era- Italy. </p><p>In a press conference earlier today,  Governor Ron DeSantis defended the department's decision. He explained that Florida actually <em>requires</em> teaching black history, but this course attempted to add a layer of indoctrination. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cEducation is about the pursuit of truth, not the imposition of ideology or the advancement of a political agenda.\\u201d</div> \u2014 Ron DeSantis (@Ron DeSantis)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GovRonDeSantis/status/1617564445617553408\">1674492391</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The course included Critical Race Theory, which DeSantis said he expected. But it also included \"queer theory.\" </p><p>DeSantis explained, \"That's the wrong side of the line for Florida standards. We believe in teaching kids facts and how to think, but we don't believe they should have an agenda imposed on them. When you try to use black history to shoehorn in queer theory, you are clearly trying to use that for political purposes.\"</p><p>Now, I'm not entirely sure what \"queer theory\" entails, particularly in regard to Black history. But my guess is, it's the study of being gay. According to <a href=\"https://www.masterclass.com/articles/queer-theory\" target=\"_blank\">MasterClass</a>, the term means, \"a field of study that examines the nature of sexuality- and gender-based normativity and how society defines and polices the concepts of heterosexuality, homosexuality, and gender and sexual identities.\" It says its goal is to \"deconstruct what is acceptable or 'normal.'\u201d Given the characters seen at <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/men-dance-parade\" target=\"_blank\">Pride</a> every year, I'd say they're succeeding on that front. <br /></p><p>The Black Queer Studies portion of the proposed <a href=\"https://www.theflstandard.com/exclusive-rejected-african-american-studies-course-in-florida-features-crt-intersectionality-and-queer-theory/\" target=\"_blank\">course</a> is described as, \"explor[ing] the concept of queer color critique, grounded in Black feminism and intersectionality, as a Black studies lens that shifts sexuality studies towards racial analysis.\u201d</p><p>Full disclosure: I have not one iota of an idea as to what any of that means. One thing I <em>do</em> know: homeschooling is getting more and more appealing every day. </p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!

I don't care if you don't. Do what you want. But don't go to a public venue in a bra and then be upset when men look at you. That's not \"internalized misogyny,\" it's just common sense. </p><p>And third, if Jessica felt so sexualized by this interaction, why upload it for literally millions of people to watch?

Sheriff Marceno tells a tale of \"a violent convicted felon roaming the streets of North Fort Myers on a scooter, with a stolen firearm in his waistband.\" The felon tried to kickstart the shooter, kickstarted the gun instead, and BLAM-O! Right in the ding dong.</p><p>Though being a public official, Sheriff Marceno did not make reference to the felon's now deformed genitalia himself. That would be inappropriate. Instead, he shared a clip from the movie <em>Austin Powers</em>. It was when Dr. Evil's phallic-looking rocket was flying through the sky, and everyone looked up making excessive references to a penis. </p><p>Trust me, it's hilarious. It was the 90s.

Then one day she didn't take a knee for Black Lives Matter while everyone else did. She stopped getting playing time after this, and after a lawsuit is now at least $100,000 richerfor having her First Amendment rights violated.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/who-kiersten-hening-why-soccer-player-suing-coach-not-taking-knee-1767164\" target=\"_blank\">Here's what happened</a>. Shortly after the George Floyd thing while virtue was being signaled from sea to shining sea, there was a  \"unity statement\" from the Atlantic Coast Conference read before a home game against the University of Florida. All of Hening's teammates kneeled. She did not. In the lawsuit, Henning alleges she had her playing time cut as a result and was berated by Coach Charles \u201cChugger\u201d Adair.</p><blockquote>\"At the next opportunity\u2014halftime of the Virginia game\u2014Coach Adair berated Hening for her stance.<br /><br />\"He singled her out and verbally attacked her, pointing a finger directly in her face.\"<br /></blockquote><p>To be clear, Hening agrees with the fact that black lives matter. Her problem is with the <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/black-lives-matter-baby-neck\" target=\"_blank\">BLM Political Organization</a> that wants <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/youtuber-jokes-about-black-lives-matter-not-caring-about-black-lives\" target=\"_blank\">to instill marxism</a> and <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/school-teaches-kids-blm-principles\" target=\"_blank\">destroy the nuclear family</a>. That is what she refused to take a knee for.</p><p>The school settled after a federal judge ruled Coach Adair may have violated Henning's First Amendment rights. The terms of the settlement were not revealed by a court document. They were revealed after a Twitter exchange when Coach Adair claimed the settlement absolved him of wrongdoing, and Henning's attorney Adam Mortara said NOPE!</p><blockquote>If by clarity you mean you are paying my client six figures in a settlement then you\u2019re right that\u2019s pretty clear.

Brodigan forgot how to math this morning.</p><p>Actor Tim Allen allegedly showed off his power tool (say it with me now...<em>MORE POWER</em>) to Pamela Anderson on the set of <em>Home Improvement</em>. It's an allegation made in the actress's new book, and one the actor denies.</p><p>Picture it. The 90s. Grunge and the golden era of Hip Hop ruled the airwaves. A young Andrew \"Dice\" Clay made us laugh. And pre-teen boys across America snuck into their older brother's <em>Playboy</em> collection to see Pamela Anderson in the buff. Though at the time, she was \"that blonde.\" People started to learn her name in 1991 when she landed a role on <em>Home Improvement</em> playing Lisa the Tool Time Girl.</p><p>The allegation made by Anderson in <em><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/books/2023/01/22/pamela-anderson-tim-allen-flashed-penis-home-improvement/11103877002/\" target=\"_blank\">Love, Pamela</a></em> is that on the very first day of filming, Allen flashed her his dingly dangly and said, quote, \"it was only fair because he had seen [Anderson] naked. Now we\u2019re even.\"</p><blockquote>On the first day of filming, I walked out of my dressing room, and Tim was in the hallway in his robe. He opened his robe and flashed me quickly \u2014 completely naked underneath.</blockquote><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"05ae6\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32888123&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>She then made twenty-two more appearances after the alleged incident. Allen issued a statement denying the claim.</p><blockquote>No, it never happened. I would never do such a thing.</blockquote><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"fc4df\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32888128&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>It is a he said/she said situation that allegedly happened thirty-two years ago, being used as the lead blurb to promote a book coming out at the end of the month. People are free to decide amongst themselves who they believe. You can assume the media will blindly believe Anderson over Allen, who they already hate. You know, what with the way he has a <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/last-man-standing-capitalism\" target=\"_blank\">different political opinion than them</a> and <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tim-allen-wants-bernie-supporters-to-know-exactly-what-socialism-is\" target=\"_blank\">routinely mocks what they believe</a>. Allen's <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tim-allen-woke-tweet\" target=\"_blank\">mere existence makes them cry</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/santa-clauses-tim-allen\" target=\"_blank\">Allen playing Santa Claus</a> was enough to send the left into meltdowns. This story involves his alleged penis. </p><p>What I will say is that, if the story is truthy, the actor is lucky it did not happen while Anderson was married to Motley Crue drummer Tommy Lee. Lee at the time would sometimes act in a brash manner. And I don't think Allen or the live studio audience would appreciate where the jackhammer wound up.</p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!
