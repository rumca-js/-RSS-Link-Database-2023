<p>Suspected gunman who killed at least 10 people at California dance studio found dead. Plus, lab-grown meat set for takeoff in the US</p><p>Good morning.</p><p>The suspect in a deadly mass shooting at a southern California dance studio on Saturday night <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/22/monterey-park-shooting-suspect-dead">died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound</a> on Sunday morning. Ten people were killed and at least 10 others were taken to hospital after a gunman opened fire in a ballroom dance studio in a city close to Los Angeles.</p><p><strong>Who were the victims?</strong> The coroner’s office is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/22/monterey-park-shooting-what-we-know-so-far">“still in the process of identifying”</a> the victims who were killed, the Los Angeles county sheriff, Robert Luna, said on Sunday. The ages of the victims appear to be in their 50s, 60s and “maybe even some beyond there”, Luna said.</p><p><strong>Do we know anything about the gun used?</strong> Two weapons have been identified so far, including a handgun with a high capacity magazine. The weapon recovered from the Alhambra location where the shooter was disarmed was described as a semiautomatic assault pistol with a high-capacity magazine attached, Luna said. He said it initially appeared that weapon would be illegal under California law.</p><p><strong>Why is Germany hesitating?</strong> There are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/22/the-guardian-view-on-germany-and-ukraine-a-fateful-hesitation">many reasons</a>, each individually understandable but which cumulatively underestimate the larger reality of Russian aggression. The worries include American caution, German history, reluctance to be Europe’s military leader, divisions in German public opinion, coalition government unity, a new defence minister and, above all, future relations with Russia.</p><p><strong>What else is happening?</strong> Here’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/23/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-334-of-the-invasion">what we know on day 334</a> of the invasion.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/23/first-thing-monterey-park-shooting-suspect-kills-himself-after-attack">Continue reading...</a>
