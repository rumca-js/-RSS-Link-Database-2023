  <p id="cv3yH2">The Supreme Court has asked the US solicitor general to submit briefs in a set of lawsuits over internet moderation in Texas and Florida, making the court likely to take one or both of the cases with a delay. As <a href="https://twitter.com/b_fung/status/1617532326346473473">noted by CNN<em> </em>reporter Brian Fung this morning</a>, the court solicited the briefs in a Monday morning <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/012323zor_0pl1.pdf">list of orders</a>, inviting President Joe Biden’s Department of Justice to formulate an official position on internet speech.</p>
<p id="1npOy9">The orders cover lawsuits by trade organization NetChoice against Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody as well as a counterclaim by Moody against NetChoice.

  <p id="tAX4Jd">Apple’s long-rumored VR / AR headset could be packed with ambitious technologies, including advanced hand tracking, the ability to see your Mac’s display, and even recreating digital versions of users in one-on-one FaceTime conversations, according to an extensive new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-23/apple-reality-pro-details-eye-hand-tracking-app-store-3d-ios-like-interface?srnd=technology-vp#xj4y7vzkg&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall"><em>Bloomberg’s</em> Mark Gurman</a>. </p>
<p id="sx5mtK">Much of the advanced technologies will be enabled by “several” external cameras that can track your hands as well as “sensors within the gadget’s housing” that can be used to read your eyes, Gurman reports. You’ll apparently be able to just look at something onscreen to select it and then pinch your fingers together to activate it, meaning the headset won’t require external controllers, like the Meta’s high-end Quest Pro and Sony’s...</p>

  <p id="AMgvUt">Apple has released iOS 16.3, which adds the ability to use a security key to lock down your Apple ID. It also tweaks the Emergency SOS call system, includes a new “Unity” wallpaper, and adds <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/18/23560648/apple-homepod-second-generation-sound-quality-impressions">support for the second-gen HomePod</a>.</p>

<p id="81Rfc7">We also anticipate that iOS 16.3 will support some nice new features for HomePod Mini owners after those devices get a new software update as well.

  <p id="3QgIVv"><em>Fortnite</em> on iOS is about to become an even more limited experience. The game was removed from the iOS and Mac app stores and Google Play in August 2020 due to Epic Games’ legal spats with Apple and Google, meaning those versions of <em>Fortnite</em> have missed out on many updates to and even entire seasons of the constantly refreshed battle royale hit. But starting January 30th, players who got <em>Fortnite</em> from those platforms won’t be able to spend V-Bucks to buy in-game items and will have to be older than 18 years of age to play, Epic said in a tweet from its Fortnite status Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1617552779358375936">on Monday</a>.</p>
<p id="vkXIRc">Technically, if you got <em>Fortnite</em> from those platforms, you can still play the game if you happened to have it installed before it was removed from...</p>

  <p id="Y8xSeP">WhatsApp could soon allow users to send photos at full quality without having to worry about image compression, if code discovered in the latest beta version of the Android app is anything to go by. <a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-23-2-11-whats-new/#more-18757"><em>WABetaInfo </em>reports</a> on a new option that would allow users to send images in their original quality.</p>
<p id="c5CV7j">Although WhatsApp already lets users pick between “automatic,” “best quality,” and “data saver,” the platform does not currently allow users to send photos in their original size and resolutions. Instead, these images are compressed — even when selecting “best quality” — to provide faster data transfers that take up less storage space.</p>

<p id="phzC5I">OpenAI hasn’t confirmed this is an official test or made any announcements. We’ve contacted the company for more info, but in the meantime remember that features <em>and</em> pricing could change before ChatGPT Professional launches for real. As OpenAI said earlier this month: “Please keep in mind that this is an early experimental program that is subject to change, and we are not making paid pro access generally available at this time.”</p>
<p id="D0c8Ue">With that in mind, what does $42 a month get you?...</p>

  		 <p>It’s easy to be cynical about Sony’s entry into the automotive world. Even the name — Afeela — evokes more eye rolls than serious expressions. But here’s why you should take it seriously. </p>

  <p id="FfXGex">Spotify will lay off 6 percent of its workforce globally, the company’s CEO Daniel Ek announced in an <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-01-23/an-update-on-january-2023-organizational-changes/">all-staff memo today</a>. Spotify had just over 9,800 full time employees as of its last earnings report, meaning today’s layoffs affect a little under 600 staff. Dawn Ostroff, head of content and ads who has been instrumental in growing Spotify’s podcasting business, is also leaving the company.</p>
<p id="U1NPRO">The layoffs make Spotify the latest tech company to cut its workforce in the midst of a global economic downturn.

  <p id="IlXrpO">The cryptocurrency lending firm Nexo has been sanctioned by the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) for offering and selling unregistered securities, as part of the latest efforts by regulators to crack down on the crypto industry. Announced via an SEC <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-11">press release</a> on January 19th, Nexo has been fined $45 million for failing to register the offer and sale of a cryptocurrency lending product, Earn Interest Product (EIP), which promised returns on deposited crypto.</p>
<p id="v5aXMh">According to the SEC’s order, Nexo started offering the EIP around June 2020 and marketed the product as a means for investors to earn interest on their crypto assets. The agency alleges that Nexo used its investors’ crypto assets in a variety of ways, including to fund...</p>
