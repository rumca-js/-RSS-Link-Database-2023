<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/apple/"><ins>Apple</ins></a> is expected to reveal its long-anticipated mixed reality headset in the coming months. The device has been in the works for several years and it'll be Apple's first new product category since Apple Watch, which debuted in 2015. Many details about the device have emerged through the rumor mill. Although much of the information in his latest piece on the headset has already been reported, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-23/apple-reality-pro-details-eye-hand-tracking-app-store-3d-ios-like-interface?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em><ins>'s Mark Gurman</ins></a> has revealed some more details about what to expect from the product, which may be called Reality Pro.</p><p>It's said to be a standalone device with an interface similar to that of iPhone and iPad and the option to pin widgets to the home screen. Alternatively, it may be used as an external display for a connected Mac. Along with Siri voice commands, there'll be the option to use a Mac, iPhone or iPad keyboard to enter text on the so-called &quot;xrOS&quot; operating system, according to the report. Apple is believed to be working on a way for users to type with their hands in midair, like in many sci-fi movies, but that option likely won't be available when the headset debuts.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It's expected that there will be health-tracking features and the option to install third-party apps. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-hollywood-directors-mixed-reality-headset-154640921.html"><ins>Virtual reality video</ins></a> is said to be a focus, with the company adding support for Apple TV+ content. It's believed that Apple has held talks with Disney, Dolby and other media partners regarding VR content, and that there will be the option to watch video on virtual screens in environments like space or a desert. Users might need to wear AirPods or other supported headphones for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/spatial%20audio/"><ins>spatial audio</ins></a> if they want to be fully immersed. Gaming may be an important aspect of the device as well.&nbsp;</p><p>The key selling point for the headset could be Apple's approach to hand and eye tracking. It's believed that the device will have sensors that can follow wearers' eyes and several external cameras that can monitor hand movements. The idea, according to the report, is that users would be able to select an item (such as an app icon or button) by looking at it and then squeezing their thumb and index finger to carry out that action. If this approach works as expected, wearers wouldn't need to use hand controllers — rival headsets typically require those. Meanwhile, the headset may have a screen on the front that can display the wearer's eyes, which might be a little offputting for some.</p><p>The device is expected to support virtual reality and augmented reality, with the ability to switch between the two modes using a Watch-like digital crown. Meta's latest headset, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-quest-pro-review-a-next-gen-headset-for-the-vr-faithful-specs-price-130045313.html"><ins>the Quest Pro</ins></a>, offers full-color passthrough for AR use and it's expected that Apple will offer a similar function.</p><p>Apple may be keeping users who need prescription glasses in mind. Many glasses wearers have found it uncomfortable to wear VR and AR headsets. However, it's claimed that Apple will offer custom lenses that sit within the headset's enclosure, which could make it more comfortable to use.</p><p>One intriguing aspect of the headset that doesn't seem to have been reported before is how it will handle one-on-one FaceTime calls. It was previously believed that other people on a call will be displayed as an icon or Memoji. That's still likely to be the case for group calls. For one-on-one chats in which both participants are wearing a Reality Pro, the report suggests that FaceTime will render realistic versions of their face and body. Processing limitations seemingly prevent this feature from being available for group calls. Other companies, such as Meta, typically render users in a more cartoonish fashion (and don't <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-avatars-metaverse-legs-vr-virtual-reality-facebook-instagram-whatsapp-190937062.html">yet include legs</a>).</p><p>Any of these features may still yet change as the headset is months away from coming to market. However, it's believed that Reality Pro will be powered by an M2 chipset. A second chip called the &quot;Reality Processor&quot; is expected to handle graphics and mixed-reality experiences.</p><p>While other headset makers typically opt for a plastic body, Apple is believed to be constructing Reality Pro using aluminum, glass and cushions with a similar look to the AirPods Max headphones. However, the battery is not expected to be built into the device. According to Gurman, the battery will be in an external pack that connects to the headset via a cable and is placed in a user's pocket. That, and a cooling fan, could help avoid the headset from overheating, but it could lead to a weight imbalance. The battery life is said to be around two hours.</p><p>Apple may <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-long-rumored-mixed-reality-headset-could-finally-arrive-this-spring-163258260.html"><ins>reveal the device this spring</ins></a> — before this year's Worldwide Developers Conference in June — and release it this fall. The price, though, may put off many who might otherwise be interested in Reality Pro. It's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-mixed-reality-headset-price-specs-rumor-145412503.html"><ins>long been expected</ins></a> that the headset will retail for around $3,000. That's twice as much as the Quest Pro.</p><p>This is a gamble for Apple as it moves into a new market that hasn't yet seen mass adoption. The report suggests that Apple expects to sell around 1 million units in the first year and the company even anticipates that the first version of Reality Pro won't turn a profit. Another version that will cost around $1,500 is said to be in the pipeline, though that may not arrive until late 2024 or early 2025. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-reportedly-working-cheaper-mixed-reality-headset-063000889.html"><ins>The cheaper model</ins></a> may eschew the Reality Pro's 4K displays for ones with lower resolution to reduce the cost.</p>

## Apple releases iOS 16.3 with support for physical security keys

<p>Apple boosted iOS security today with the release of its 16.3 software update. For the first time, iOS users can use physical security keys for two-factor authentication (2FA) of their Apple ID. This new measure, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MTMwZTJmMC1hMTRmLTRjNWUtYmRhYi1jZDUyYWM3ZDhlNzkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL25ld3Nyb29tLzIwMjIvMTIvYXBwbGUtYWR2YW5jZXMtdXNlci1zZWN1cml0eS13aXRoLXBvd2VyZnVsLW5ldy1kYXRhLXByb3RlY3Rpb25zLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiN2ZjNjYyMGYtYTRhMi00YTE0LTkxMGEtYWFhYzdiZTZkYzA0In0&amp;signature=AQAAAah-SF7H6fLqSwEnxdOcpY5Nv3ERx7eDOu0-NgF_JMA1&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2022%2F12%2Fapple-advances-user-security-with-powerful-new-data-protections%2F">announced</a> by the company last year, adds a layer of protection for those facing unusual security threats — people like celebrities, journalists and government employees.</p><p>Physical key support should help prevent phishing scams, which can trick users into allowing an intruder access through 2FA. Using a device like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/yubico-yubikey-bio-fingerprint-reader-130034276.html">YubiKey</a> means only those with access to the physical key can get into your account. Although some security keys plug into the iPhone’s Lightning port, most use USB. However, NFC and Bluetooth keys should work with the iPhone, and you can plug a USB one into Apple’s Lightning to USB 3 Camera Adapter.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>iOS 16.3 also includes updates to Emergency SOS controls. You’ll still be able to call emergency services by holding down the power and volume-up buttons, but now, it won't call 911 until you release them. This allows you to cancel before emergency services are notified.</p><p>The update also adds bug fixes for issues like strokes not appearing on shared boards in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-freeform-app-beta-213032190.html">Freeform app</a>, horizontal lines appearing on the iPhone 14 Pro Max after waking and a bug that prevented the Home lock screen widget from showing the Home app's status. Finally, it adds support for the new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-homepod-2023-announced-price-specs-141225333.html">second-generation HomePod</a>.</p><p>If you own a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-wwdc-2022-ios-ipados-macos-watchos-supported-devices-200156650.html">compatible</a> device, you can install the update by heading to Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update.</p>

<p>The native iOS and macOS versions of <em>Fortnite </em>are about to become even more limited. Since the start of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-maker-epic-games-sues-apple-195415590.html">legal feud</a> with Apple back in the summer of 2020, Epic Games has allowed players who had <em>Fortnite</em> installed on their devices prior to the game's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-removes-fortnite-190920925.html">removal from the App Store</a> to continue playing. However, due to the removal, Epic hasn’t updated those versions of the game, meaning they’ve been stuck on <em>Fortnite’s </em>13.40 release for more than two years. Effectively, that meant they’ve existed in a sort of limbo. All of the gameplay changes Epic has made to <em>Fortnite</em> since then (and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-zero-build-mode-142940130.html"><ins>there have been many</ins></a>), as well as all <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-obi-wan-kenobi-disney-plus-155656128.html"><ins>new cosmetics</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-chapter-4-season-1-announced-201610345.html"><ins>seasonal passes</ins></a> the company has introduced, haven’t made their way over to the native iOS and macOS releases. Now those versions are about to become even more restrictive.</p><div id="d60487d9a32e4f838ca1acec9a67aa60"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Beginning January 30, Fortnite players using the August 2020 13.40 app build previously available on iOS, Mac, and Google Play can no longer spend V-Bucks and must be over 18 to play. (1/2)</p>— Fortnite Status (@FortniteStatus) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1617552779358375936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 23, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>Starting on January 30th, Epic won’t allow you to spend <em>Fortnite’s </em>V-Bucks currency within the game’s iOS, Mac and Google Play versions. You’ll also need to be over the age of 18 to play. “We want all versions of our games to use the current suite of Epic Online Services including parental controls, purchasing defaults, and parental verification features,” Epic <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1617552817291464704?s=20&amp;t=sZMt0nEDYpdKL66Qq9JmXg"><ins>said on Twitter</ins></a>. “We are not able to update the app on these platforms given Apple and Google’s restrictions on <em>Fortnite</em>.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In December, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/epic-games-cabined-accounts-kids-fortnite-fall-guys-rocket-league-metaverse-153028144.html"><ins>introduced new accounts</ins></a> designed specifically for younger players. They prevent kids from spending money in <em>Fortnite’s</em> in-game store and using voice chat without a parent’s consent. That same month, the Federal Trade Commission announced Epic had agreed to pay <a href="https://www.engadget.com/epic-games-ftc-settlement-fortnite-170857237.html"><ins>$520 million</ins></a> to settle allegations it had violated the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act and “tricked millions of players into making unintentional purchases.&quot;</p><p>Most players won’t be affected by the restriction since there are ways to access <em>Fortnite </em>without going through the App Store or Google Play Store. On iOS and macOS, for instance, you can play the game through <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-ge-force-now-ultimate-hands-on-the-enthusiasts-choice-for-cloud-gaming-specs-release-140035365.html"><ins>GeForce Now</ins></a>. On Android, meanwhile, it’s possible to download the native version of <em>Fortnite</em> directly from Epic’s website.</p>

## Facebook Messenger encrypted chats now include more of the features you expect

<p>You no longer have to give up the privacy of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-testing-default-end-to-end-encryption-messenger-131733068.html">end-to-end encryption in Facebook Messenger</a> just to get the creature comforts you take for granted. Meta is <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/01/expanding-features-for-end-to-end-encryption-on-messenger/">bringing</a> several common features to encrypted chats. You can now choose themes, set profiles for group conversations and use custom emoji as well as reactions. Active status and web link previews now work in this more secure mode, while the Android crowd can take advantage of floating Bubbles to talk while they're using other apps.</p><p>You're more likely to use encrypted chats, too. Meta is expanding tests that make encryption the default for Facebook Messenger. You'll see the changes to some conversation threads in the &quot;next few months,&quot; the company says. If you're part of the test, you'll get a notification in a relevant thread.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Meta started testing default encryption last August. At the time, it said it hoped to roll out the Facebook Messenger upgrade sometime in 2023. The social media firm didn't provide an updated timeline, but the feature expansion takes Meta considerably closer to that goal — there's considerably more parity with unencrypted chats. Encrypted Messenger <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-messenger-encrypted-chat-feature-update-170051506.html">caught up on some features</a> at the start of 2022, but was still well behind its less secure counterpart.</p><p>Not everyone will be happy. Officials in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-31-how-ag-barr-is-going-to-get-encryption-backdoors.html">the US</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-uk-government-is-reportedly-planning-ad-campaign-attacking-end-to-end-encryption-101610703.html">UK</a> and elsewhere have attacked end-to-end encryption. They're concerned criminals could use encrypted chats to discuss plans beyond the reach of law enforcement and surveillance agencies. Politicians, such as former US Attorney General Bill Barr, have called on Meta to weaken encryption by creating &quot;backdoors.&quot; Meta has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-10-facebook-rejects-call-to-weaken-encryption.html">refused to back down</a>, though, and it's evident that the company is determined to bolster privacy across its products.</p>

## Microsoft expands its pact with OpenAI in 'multibillion dollar' deal

<p>Microsoft is once again <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-22-microsoft-invests-openai-azure-supercomputing.html">pouring money into OpenAI</a> as part of an expanded partnership. The tech giant is <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/01/23/microsoftandopenaiextendpartnership/">making</a> a &quot;multibillion dollar&quot; investment that will lead to wider uses of OpenAI's technology, as well as stronger behind-the-scenes support. While the two companies are short on specifics, Microsoft says you can expect &quot;new categories of digital experiences&quot; that include both consumer-facing and business products. The developer-focused Azure OpenAI Service will play a role.</p><p>The continued union will also see Microsoft boost its investments in supercomputers that accelerate OpenAI's research. Azure will remain OpenAI's sole cloud provider for products, research and services. The exact size of the financial contribution isn't known, but a <em>Bloomberg</em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-23/microsoft-makes-multibillion-dollar-investment-in-openai?sref=10lNAhZ9">source</a> claims Microsoft is investing $10 billion over &quot;multiple years.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Microsoft first backed OpenAI in 2019, and returned in 2021. <em>The New York Times</em> notes it &quot;quietly&quot; invested an extra $2 billion since that initial round. The companies have grown closer since their collaboration began. On top of the Azure service, Microsoft has launched OpenAI-powered features that include <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-first-gpt-3-feature-coding-business-apps-122557556.html">natural language programming</a> and a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-designer-dall-e-2-annouced-140007501.html">DALL-E 2 graphic design tool</a>. OpenAI uses Microsoft's infrastructure to train its best-known systems, including DALL-E 2 and the popular <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-add-chat-gpt-azure-openai-062845310.html">ChatGPT</a> bot. ChatGPT is coming to Azure soon.</p><p>There's no mention of some rumored developments, such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-reportedly-integrating-chatgpt-technology-into-bing-131502579.html">building ChatGPT into Bing</a>. However, this expansion may help Microsoft seize a competitive advantage. Google reportedly sees ChatGPT as a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-chatgpt-ai-chatbot-search-170007802.html">threat to its search business</a>, and is believed to be devoting much of its attention to a search chatbot and other AI products despite a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-imagen-text-to-image-ai-unprecedented-photorealism-144205123.html">reluctance to fully embrace the technology</a> over concerns about copyright. Even if the deeper OpenAI partnership doesn't improve Bing, Microsoft may benefit by forcing rivals like Google to change course.</p>

## MacBook Pro 14-inch review (2023): A blessing for creatives

<p>With its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-book-pro-14-16-inch-review-2021-apple-mighty-macs-130011975.html">last batch of MacBook Pros</a>, Apple gave its more demanding fans everything they wanted: Tons of ports, lots of power, and genuinely great screens. As usual, the company is following up that major redesign with a straightforward chip upgrade, featuring the new M2 Pro and M2 Max. They're faster, as you'd expect, but they also deliver a few features power users may appreciate, like 8K video output and support for WiFi 6E.</p><p>Once Apple locks in a redesign, it typically doesn't mess with a good thing (save for complete disasters like the trashcan Mac Pro). So it's no surprise to see that this year's <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BcHBsZS1NYWNCb29rLUxhcHRvcC0xMCVFMiU4MCU5MWNvcmUtMTYlRTIlODAlOTFjb3JlL2RwL0IwQlNIRFZCWFo_cmVmXz1hc3Rfc3RvX2RwJnRoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8taGEtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImE0ZjdiOWEwLTEyODItNGMwMi1hMzUwLTUzNjdhMjdhNGEwYSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfWVZrhVoG805T-K8APL4ogLSj3gjfSlsLrxP_-EboWN&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-MacBook-Laptop-10%25E2%2580%2591core-16%25E2%2580%2591core%2Fdp%2FB0BSHDVBXZ%3Fref_%3Dast_sto_dp%26th%3D1">MacBook Pro 14</a> doesn't look any different than the 2021 model. It still boasts a gorgeous 14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR display with ProMotion support and a prominent notch housing a 1080p webcam. It has all of the ports you'd actually want, including a MagSafe power connection, three Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports, HDMI, a headphone jack and a full-sized SD card slot. And the overall shape of the computer remains relatively flat, an evolution of the long-lived unibody MacBook Pro design.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Under the hood, though, the MacBook Pro 14 has been dramatically upgraded. It can be equipped with Apple's new M2 Pro chip, which offers up to a 12-core CPU and 19-core GPU, or the M2 Max, which squeezes in a 12-core CPU and 38-core GPU. Much like Intel's new hybrid processors, as well as mobile chips from Qualcomm, Apple relies on a combination of core speeds for its CPUs (the 12-core chips, for example, have eight performance cores and four efficiency cores). The previous M1 Pro and M1 Max topped out with 10 CPU cores and 16 or 32 GPU cores, respectively.</p><figure><img alt="MacBook Pro 14-inch (2022) side profile showing off ports" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/b014fc30-9aca-11ed-b7f7-351b3372956b" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Apple claims the M2 Pro is around 20 percent faster than its predecessor in CPU speeds, and up to 30 percent faster when it comes to graphics. The M2 Max, meanwhile, is up to 30 percent faster than the M1 Max in terms of graphics. We tested the fully-upgraded $3,299 MacBook Pro, which was equipped with the M2 Max chip with 38 GPU cores and 64GB of RAM. It scored around 2,600 points (19 percent) faster in the GeekBench 5 multitasking CPU benchmark, compared to the M1 Max-equipped MacBook Pro 16. It was also 18 percent faster in the GPU-powered GeekBench 5 Compute test and a whopping 60 percent faster than the M1 Max Mac Studio in the 3DMark Wildlife Extreme benchmark.</p><table><tbody><tr><th><p>None</p></th><th><p>Geekbench 5 CPU</p></th><th><p>Geekbench 5 Compute</p></th><th><p>Cinebench R23</p></th><th><p>3DMark Wildlife Extreme</p></th></tr><tr><td><p>Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch (Apple M2 Max, 2023)</p></td><td><p>1,970/15,338</p></td><td><p>71,583</p></td><td><p>1,603/14,725</p></td><td><p>18 ,487</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch, (Apple M2, 2022)</p></td><td><p>1,938/8,984</p></td><td><p>27,304</p></td><td><p>1,583/8,719</p></td><td><p>6,767</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch (Apple M1 Pro)</p></td><td><p>1,767/11,777</p></td><td><p>38,359</p></td><td><p>1,515/12,118</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Apple MacBook Pro 16-inch (Apple M1 Max, 2021)</p></td><td><p>1,783/12,693</p></td><td><p>60,167</p></td><td><p>1,524/12,281</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Apple Mac Studio (Apple M1 Ultra)</p></td><td><p>1,785/23,942</p></td><td><p>85,800</p></td><td><p>1,537/24,078</p></td><td><p>10,020</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>These are phenomenal results if you're planning to use the MacBook Pro to its full potential. But I'll admit, during everyday usage, I didn't notice any major performance benefits over the previous models. That's not really a knock against the new computer, it's more a testament to how much Apple got right last time. Unlike PCs, you probably won't be gaming too much with your Mac, either, so there's less of a reason to chase frequent upgrades. On that note, it's nice to see some modern games with native Mac support. <em>Resident Evil Village</em> easily hits 60fps on the MacBook Pro at full resolution, but I wouldn't be surprised if the same was true for the M1 models.</p><section><img alt="MacBook Pro 14-inch (2022) running Resident Evil Village" class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/b014d521-9aca-11ed-a96f-a5dc5f3d1c78" /></section><p>If you're among the folks dealing with large video encoding or high compute jobs daily, though, it may be worth moving up from the last MacBook Pro. It took me 31 seconds to transcode a minute-long 4K clip into 1080p using Handbrake — but the M1 Max MacBook Pro 16 took a full 10 seconds longer. Extrapolate that to longer jobs and you could be saving yourself some serious time. And if you've managed to hold out with an Intel MBP until now, it's definitely time to upgrade — you'll easily see a night and day difference in speed.</p><p>Aside from its performance, the MacBook Pro 14 remains a wonderful workhorse to live with. The MiniLED Liquid Retina display looks fantastically bright, especially when viewing HDR content. Mostly, though, I appreciated the smooth scrolling thanks to Apple's 120Hz ProMotion refresh rate. The six speaker sound system remains excellent, with crisp and punchy audio that's leagues ahead of most other laptops. And I remain impressed with the MacBook Pro's built-in three-mic array. It's no replacement for a dedicated USB microphone, but it sounds great during video calls.</p><figure><img alt="MacBook Pro 14-inch (2022) keyboard and trackpad" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/b014d522-9aca-11ed-bef8-1d2989205a8c" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>The MacBook Pro's keyboard is certainly better than the old butterfly models, but I wish Apple was able to deliver more key travel. It's still great to type on, to be clear, I'm just feeling a bit spoiled from the mechanical keyboards I've seen in some gaming laptops. The Pro's trackpad remains best in class though, with a large surface area and responsive performance. After testing the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dell-xps-13-plus-review-beauty-usability-120015270.html">XPS 13 Plus</a> last year, which featured an attractive yet hard to use trackpad hidden in the wrist rest, I'm even more appreciative of Apple's clean design. It turns out that being able to feel the difference between the trackpad and the wrist rest is pretty helpful!</p><p>Apple is touting better battery life as another major benefit of the M2 Pro and Max chips, and I definitely noticed an improvement. The previous MacBook Pro lasted 12 hours and 36 minutes during our testing, but the new model made it to 15 hours and 10 minutes. That's a healthy step up, especially if you find yourself stuck on a long flight without any working outlets. Apple says that the new MacBook Pros can reach up to 22 hours of battery life, but take note that figure only refers to the 16-inch model.</p><figure><img alt="MacBook Pro 14-inch (2022) notch" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/b014ae10-9aca-11ed-b7f5-cd19f7a51027" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Just like last time, the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BcHBsZS1NYWNCb29rLUxhcHRvcC0xMCVFMiU4MCU5MWNvcmUtMTYlRTIlODAlOTFjb3JlL2RwL0IwQlNIRFZCWFo_cmVmXz1hc3Rfc3RvX2RwJnRoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8taGEtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImE0ZjdiOWEwLTEyODItNGMwMi1hMzUwLTUzNjdhMjdhNGEwYSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfWVZrhVoG805T-K8APL4ogLSj3gjfSlsLrxP_-EboWN&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-MacBook-Laptop-10%25E2%2580%2591core-16%25E2%2580%2591core%2Fdp%2FB0BSHDVBXZ%3Fref_%3Dast_sto_dp%26th%3D1">14-inch MacBook Pro</a> starts at $1,999 — a huge leap from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-pro-13-inch-review-m2-2022-130005000.html">$1,299 13-inch model</a>. I'm still a bit baffled by that MacBook Pro, though. Most mainstream shoppers would be better off with the revamped <a href="http://0.0.0.0/">M2 MacBook Air</a>, while power users would prefer the beefier 14-inch model. If you're aiming for something bigger, the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMEJTSEY3TExMP3RoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8taGEtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImE0ZjdiOWEwLTEyODItNGMwMi1hMzUwLTUzNjdhMjdhNGEwYSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAbfrHwnqZKqZGPMRBlxaneQTol1gSVMiADL9l_2ase2l&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BSHF7LLL%3Fth%3D1">16-inch MacBook Pro</a> starts at $2,499. New gear also means the old models will inevitably go on sale, so it's worth keeping an eye on the M1 Pro and Max machines if you're aiming to save some money. Sure, they're a bit slower, but you could put that extra money towards buying more RAM or storage.</p><p>It's no wonder Apple announced the new MacBook Pros without much fanfare. It's just a simple spec bump, not the sort of thing most buyers would get too excited about. But for the creative professionals who need the most power possible, it's another reason to stick with Apple instead of jumping to a PC.</p>

## Microsoft to stop selling Windows 10 downloads as part of planned 2025 shutdown

<p>As part of an effort to wind down support of Windows 10 Home and Pro, Microsoft is stopping sales of downloads on January 31st, according to a <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=67071605-d4df-494e-8d9c-c9c236b8bb38&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Microsoft&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NzA3MTYwNS1kNGRmLTQ5NGUtOGQ5Yy1jOWMyMzZiOGJiMzgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWljcm9zb2Z0LmNvbS9lbi11cy9kL3dpbmRvd3MtMTAtaG9tZS9kNzZxeDRiem53azQiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImVhYThmYWE1LWQ4OWMtNGJhNS04YmQyLWRjNWZkNmQ3NDY2YiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAcmCatS6MPf6ZfcEqQ0wy76zYxxzchboDY-UFV5DBNsv&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fwindows-10-home%2Fd76qx4bznwk4">product page</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/23/23567281/microsoft-windows-10-download-license-sales-ending"><em>The Verge</em></a>. That date "will be the last day this Windows 10 download [and all-important license keys] are offered for sale," according to Microsoft. However, it will continue to support Windows 10 with security updates until it's discontinued for good in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-windows-10-end-of-support-date-134043024.html">October 2025.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>"Customers have until January 31, 2023 to purchase Windows 10 Home and Windows 10 Pro from this site," a Microsoft spokesperson told <em>The Verge</em>, while advising customers to purchase Windows 11 instead. However, Windows 10 may still be offered elsewhere from other retailers and OEMs, until Microsoft confirms otherwise.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Windows 10 was first launched in 2015, and so will be discontinued exactly 10 years later. The company announced the end date in June of 2021 as part of its "<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/windows-10-home-and-pro">modern lifecycle policy</a>," just prior to the launch of Windows 11. The OS received generally <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-07-28-windows-10-review.html">good reviews</a> and met with success when it arrived — in part because it replaced Windows 8, which <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2618073/windows-8-review--yes--it-s-that-bad.html">wasn't</a>, er, as warmly received.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Windows 11 launched to decent acclaim, with applause for the polish and boos for the weird upgrade restrictions. The minimum system requirements were relaxed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-windows-11-supported-processors-update-175544403.html">soon after launch</a>, but migration from Windows 10 has still been slow, according to <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-surprising-number-of-pcs-cant-upgrade-to-windows-11-heres-why/">recent reports</a>.&nbsp;</p>

## Spotify is laying off 6 percent of employees

<p>Spotify is laying off 6 percent of its workforce as part of a company-wide restructuring, CEO Daniel Ek <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-01-23/an-update-on-january-2023-organizational-changes/">wrote</a> in a message to employees. The precise number of people who will lose their jobs wasn't provided, but the company employs around 9,800 people, according to its last earnings report. In addition, chief content officer Dawn Ostroff is stepping down as part of the changes, Ek said.&nbsp;</p><p>Much like Google's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-parent-alphabet-is-laying-off-12000-employees-105523115.html">Sundar Pichai</a>, Ek said he takes &quot;full accountability for the moves that got us here today.&quot; The company will provide 5 months of severance to employees on average, along with acrued and unused vacation time, healthcare during the severance period, immigration support and career support. The majority of Spotify's employees are based in the US, followed by Sweden and the UK.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company is &quot;fundamentally changing how we operate at the top,&quot; delegating its engineering and product work to the new chief product and chief business officers, Ek said. &quot;These changes will allow me to get back to the part where I do my best work—spending more time working on the future of Spotify.&quot;</p><p>Like other tech firms, Spotify has expanded rapidly over the past couple of years, particularly in the area of podcasting. It spent over a billion dollars on podcast networks, hosting services and shows like <em>The Joe Rogan Experience</em>. Much of that effort was driven by chief content officer Dawn Ostroff, who grew podcast content by 40 times, according to Ek. As part of the changes, however, she'll be leaving the company.</p><p>Spotify joins other tech giants in making mass layoffs, partially due to a downturn in the economy and partially due to hiring sprees. Over the past few weeks, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-confirms-layoffs-151816595.html">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-expanded-job-cuts-18000-102059372.html">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-mass-layoffs-facebook-111406126.html">Meta</a> and Google laid off 51,000 employees combined. From 2020 to 2022, however, those companies <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/18/apple-had-slower-headcount-growth-than-tech-peers-no-layoffs-yet.html">hired</a> many more employees than they let go. Spotify itself had 6,617 employees in 2021 and 9,800 a year later, prior to the layoffs.&nbsp;</p>

## The Morning After: The FAA grounded all US flights due to mistakenly deleted files

<p>The FAA paused all domestic departures in the US on the morning of January 11th because its NOTAM or Notice to Air Missions system failed. Now we know why: deleted files. Contractors working on the Federal Aviation Administration's NOTAM system, it seems, deleted some crucial files by accident. This resulted in delays and cancellations of thousands of US flights. The issue even impacted military flights that partly relied on FAA NOTAMs: Pilots reportedly had to call around to ask for potential flight hazards.</p><p>Apparently, its contractors were synchronizing a main and a back-up database when they &quot;unintentionally deleted files&quot; that turned out to be necessary to keep the alert system running. The FAA reiterated it has &quot;so far found no evidence of a cyberattack or malicious intent.&quot; We’ve all accidentally deleted a file, sure.

<p>Microsoft's best Xbox One and Xbox series wireless controller is the Xbox Elite Series 2, and the white Core version is now available at the lowest price we've seen yet. You can pick one up at Amazon-owned Woot for <a href="https://electronics.woot.com/offers/xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-core">just $100</a>, or $30 off the regular price.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-xbox-elite-series-2-wireless-controller-white-140019249.html">Elite Series 2 Core</a> gives you the same exact controller as the Elite Series 2, without the additional accessories. It's designed with competitive gamers in mind, offering a wrap-around rubberized grip, shorter hair trigger locks and 40 hours of battery life.

## FDA clears Wandercraft's exoskeleton for stroke patient rehab

<p>Stroke patients in the US could soon take advantage of cutting-edge robotics during the recovery process. The Food and Drug Administration has cleared Wandercraft's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-27-wandercraft-exoskeleton-paraplegic-help-walk.html">Atalante exoskeleton</a> for use in stroke rehabilitation. The machine can help with intensive gait training, particularly for people with limited upper body mobility that might prevent using other methods.</p><p>The current-generation Atalante is a self-balancing, battery-powered device with an adjustable gait that can help with early steps through to more natural walking later in therapy. While the hardware still needs to be used in a clinical setting with help from a therapist, its hands-free use lets patients reestablish their gait whether or not they can use their arms.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Wandercraft plans to deliver its first exoskeletons to the US during the first quarter of the year, though it didn't name initial customers. It only recently launched its commercial business in the country, but financial backer Quadrant Management says Wandercraft could &quot;significantly scale&quot; its operations within the next one to two years.</p><p>FDA-cleared exoskeletons are still relatively rare, and are still limited to helping with specific conditions. Last June, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-03-16-ekso-bionics-robotic-suit-eyes-on-video.html">Ekso Bionics</a> received <a href="https://ir.eksobionics.com/press-releases/detail/729/ekso-bionics-receives-fda-clearance-to-market-its-eksonr">permission</a> to market its EksoNR device for multiple sclerosis rehab. Wandercraft's approval makes the technology accessible for a wider range of patients, and may be especially helpful when strokes are a major cause of long-term disability in the US. Over 795,000 people have a stroke in the country each year — this could help some of them regain freedom of movement.</p>
