<p>It has been more than four months since the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini at the hands of Iran's 'morality police' sparked waves of protests across the country. After mass arrests, the Iranian regime has now begun executing people connected to the protests in what the UN human rights office has called ‘unfair trials based on forced confessions’. As concern grows for those demanding change in Iran, journalist Deepa Parent explains what we know about the executions so far – and how they have created a 'fire under the ashes' by fuelling protesters' anger</p><p><br /></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/jan/20/iran-fears-grow-of-security-crackdown-in-zahedan-as-anti-regime-protests-persist">Iran: fears grow of security crackdown in Zahedan as anti-regime protests persist</a><br /></li></ul> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2023/jan/23/why-executions-are-not-stopping-iran-protesters-video-explainer">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There were over 40 goals across the weekend as the league returned from its winter break in brilliant but chaotic fashion</p><p>You know when a driver, frustrated in traffic, finally sees a stretch of open road and blazes off with inappropriate and unwarranted speed into the middle distance? Welcome back, the Bundesliga. German football’s first domestic action in nearly 10 weeks was a dizzying assault on the senses, a torrent of copper from an arcade coin pusher machine, a stream of consciousness from a chatterbox that has been starved of company and has stayed silent all day.</p><p>It all started on Friday night in Leipzig, where fireworks were expected in a face off between the league’s two best teams. Instead, the visit of Bayern was more about measure and respectful distances. After a bleak midwinter of fretting over a replacement for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/10/manuel-neuer-goalkeeper-bayern-munich-germany-injured-skiing">the injured Manuel Neuer</a>, the champions bedded in Yann Sommer, signed on Thursday and making his debut, characteristically unruffled, the day after.

<p>Storm likely to bring huge rainfalls to African country this week; severe thunderstorms forecast in southern US</p><p>The island of Madagascar is facing a risk of severe flooding this week. Severe Tropical Storm Cheneso made landfall across north-eastern Madagascar on 19&nbsp;January, with maximum sustained winds of 65mph. The storm has since weakened to become a non-tropical depression, and was centred just west of central Madagascar early on 23 January. Cheneso brought strong winds to coastal regions, while heavy rain brought significant flooding to northern parts of the country.</p><p>The remnants of Cheneso will now remain essentially stationary just west of central Madagascar for about four days. On 22 January, Météo-France Réunion issued a 30-60% chance of Cheneso regaining tropical characteristics during this period – dependent upon the system moving sufficiently far offshore across the Mozambique Channel. Regardless of tropical redevelopment, Cheneso’s remnants bring a significant threat of flooding through Thursday, with western areas most at risk. Rainfall totals of 75-100mm are expected each day, bringing storm totals in excess of 500mm – approaching the average annual rainfall in the west coast town of Morondava of 764mm.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/23/weather-tracker-storm-cheneso-brings-flooding-risk-to-madagascar">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Give them credit: America’s Team consistently find interesting ways to come up short in the postseason as their Super Bowl drought continues</p><p>For the second straight year, the Dallas Cowboys’ season ended at the hands of the San Francisco 49ers after a botched final play. In 2022, Dak Prescott futilely ran out the clock rather than try a Hail Mary. This time around, their attempt to reach their first NFC Championship Game since 1995 ended in a blown trick play during which <a href="https://ftw.usatoday.com/lists/49ers-cowboys-roasted-over-hilariously-bad-final-play">they couldn’t even get a lateral off</a>. The 49ers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/22/49ers-face-eagles-for-place-in-super-bowl-after-smothering-punchless-cowboys">beat the Cowboys 19-12 </a>and there are already calls for Dallas head coach Mike McCarthy’s job.</p><p>Would firing McCarthy be an overreaction? Possibly. However, this was Dallas’s seventh straight loss in the divisional round (and that’s before we get to the defeats in the wildcard round) and Cowboys fans have legitimate reasons to believe that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/17/dallas-cowboys-playoff-loss-san-francisco-49ers-dak-prescott-run-play">the most valuable franchise in sports</a> has established itself as a perennial underachiever.

<p>Arsenal reap the rewards of an old-school striker, Thiago Silva turns back the clock and Ten Hag’s tactics hit a snag</p><p>Fast-paced, tactically intricate and dramatic to the last, Arsenal v Manchester United was a heavyweight clash that lived up to its billing. It also showcased two models of centre-forward that were meant to be extinct: the old-fashioned target man and the old-fashioned poacher. Spearheading United’s attack, Wout Weghorst pressed with zeal and offered a focal point for United’s free-roaming wide men. It was his peeling run, drawing Gabriel to his left, that afforded Marcus Rashford the angle to blast home the opener. Nketiah pressed with similar intelligence but dropped deep when required to link with his midfield. Both his goals were straight from the school of the penalty-box predator, ghosting in at the back post to meet a cross and jabbing home a loose ball from practically underneath the crossbar. In the age of the all-round No 9, both these moulds of striker had supposedly been consigned to the past. Both players proved their worth in a match that certainly belonged to the present. <strong>Alex Hess</strong></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/22/arsenal-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report">Arsenal 2-2 Manchester United</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/21/leicester-brighton-premier-league-match-report">Liverpool 0-0 Chelsea</a></em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jan/23/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sebastian Coe promised to be ‘guided by science’ when it comes to sport’s most divisive issue. But World Athletics’ solution is clearly designed to protect it from legal action too</p><p>No female athlete has yet commented. Can you blame them given the vicious amount of social media abuse this issue generates? During a star-spangled athletics career, Sebastian Coe rarely snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. The most famous exception came at the Olympic 800m final in Moscow where he made so many tactical missteps that his father and coach, Peter, used a coarse four-letter word to describe his run. However this weekend Coe became reacquainted with similar levels of opprobrium after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/21/world-athletics-proposals-preserve-path-trans-women-female-category">World Athletics’ proposed solution</a> to sport’s most divisive issue became public.</p><p>For months, the World Athletics president <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jun/20/sebastian-coe-hints-athletics-may-bar-transgender-women-from-female-competition">Coe has strongly hinted</a> that trans women and athletes with differences of sexual development (DSD), who are 46 XY with male testes but were reported female at birth, should only compete in female sport if the science shows it is fair. “Biology trumps identity,” he said in the summer. “If we ever get pushed into a corner to that point where we’re making a judgment about fairness or inclusion, I will always fall down on the side of fairness.” Just in case there was any doubt, Coe also promised to “be guided by the science”, before adding: “Fairness is non-negotiable.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jan/23/world-athletics-transgender-regulations-see-scientific-rigour-give-way-to-a-fudge">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Germany will not “stand in the way” of Poland sending Leopard tanks to Ukraine; Russia claims more progress in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">See all our Russia-Ukraine war coverage</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Germany <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/22/russia-claims-advances-zaporizhzhia-nato-squabbles-tanks-ukraine">will not “stand in the way” of Poland</a> sending Leopard tanks to Ukraine</strong>, foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said, in what appeared to be the clearest signal yet from Berlin that European allies could deliver the German-made hardware. Asked in an interview with French television station LCI what would happen if Poland sent its Leopard 2 tanks without German approval, Baerbock replied through a translator: “For the moment the question has not been asked, but if we were asked we would not stand in the way.”</p><p><strong>German chancellor Olaf Scholz promised</strong> <strong>that Germany will “continue to support Ukraine – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/22/russia-claims-advances-zaporizhzhia-nato-squabbles-tanks-ukraine">for as long and as comprehensively as necessary</a>”</strong>, adding: “Together, as Europeans – in defence of our European peace project.” Germany’s new defence minister, Boris Pistorius, plans to visit Ukraine soon, he told a German newspaper.</p><p><strong>Scholz said future decisions on weapons deliveries will be made in coordination with allies, including the United States</strong>. Under pressure to allow the shipment of German-made tanks to Ukraine, the chancellor said that all weapons deliveries to Ukraine so far have taken place in close coordination with western partners.</p><p><strong>Poland announced it is ready to deliver 14 Leopard tanks to Kyiv but is waiting for “a clear statement” from Berlin, in comments made before <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/22/russia-claims-advances-zaporizhzhia-nato-squabbles-tanks-ukraine">German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock’s interview</a>.</strong> Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, criticised Germany’s failure to supply tanks to Ukraine. “Germany’s attitude is unacceptable. It has been almost a year since the war began. Innocent people are dying every day,” he said.</p><p><strong>Former UK prime minister <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/22/boris-johnson-makes-surprise-trip-to-ukraine">Boris Johnson made a surprise visit to Ukraine</a></strong>, where he said that it was “the moment to double down and to give the Ukrainians all the tools they need to finish the job”. Downing Street said Rishi Sunak is “supportive” of Boris Johnson’s visit, despite warnings that it would undermine the current prime minister’s authority.</p><p><strong>French president Emmanuel Macron said on Sunday he does not rule out the possibility of sending Leclerc tanks to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a>. </strong>“As for the Leclercs, I have asked the defence ministry to work on it. Nothing is excluded,” he said while speaking at a summit with German chancellor Scholz.</p><p><strong>Russia claimed to have made advances in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region</strong><em>. </em>After months of stalemate in the south-eastern region, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/22/russia-claims-advances-zaporizhzhia-nato-squabbles-tanks-ukraine">Moscow-installed officials say the front is now “mobile”</a> while the Ukrainian army reported that 15 settlements had come under artillery fire. “During offensive operations in the direction of Zaporizhzhia, units of the eastern military district took up more advantageous ground and positions,” the defence ministry said on Sunday.</p><p><strong>Zelenskiy has vowed Ukraine will not tolerate corruption and promised forthcoming key decisions on uprooting it this week. </strong>“I want this to be clear: there will be no return to what used to be in the past, to the way various people close to state institutions or those who spent their entire lives chasing a chair used to live,” he said in his nightly video address. The EU has made anti-corruption reforms one of its key requirements for Ukraine’s membership to the bloc, after granting Kyiv candidate status last year.</p><p><strong>Norway’s army chief has estimated 180,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded in over the course of the conflict, while the figure for the Ukrainians is 100,000 military casualties and 30,000 dead civilians</strong>. Norwegian chief of defence Eirik Kristoffersen gave the figures in an interview with TV2, without specifying how the numbers were calculated. The figures cannot be independently verified.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/23/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-334-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>
