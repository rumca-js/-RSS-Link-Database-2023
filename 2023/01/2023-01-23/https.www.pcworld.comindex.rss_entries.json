Ted Lieu (D-CA) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/23/opinion/ted-lieu-ai-chatgpt-congress.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytopinion&amp;xcust=2-3-1481564-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">authored an opinion piece</a> in <em>The New York Times</em> on Monday, arguing that AI has emerged as a powerful tool that can be used to benefit humanity &mdash; or deceive it, and worse. In fact, the example he cited, reproduced above, wasn&rsquo;t written by Lieu, but by ChatGPT, the AI chatbot developed by OpenAI. (<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://ChatGPT%20may%20charge%20%2442/mo%20for%20a%20paid%20tier,%20as%20Microsoft%20invests%20again&amp;xcust=2-3-1481564-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">OpenAI received a multibillion-dollar investment from Microsoft</a> on Monday, amid user reports that it is unveiling a paid version.) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lieu, who earned a B.S. degree in Computer Science from Stanford, noted that AI is now present in everything from smart speakers to Google Maps. But where AI fails, people can be hurt: The editorial points out that a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.ktvu.com/news/tesla-driver-blames-self-driving-mode-for-8-vehicle-crash-on-bay-bridge&amp;xcust=2-3-1481564-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">driver blamed Tesla&rsquo;s self-driving mode</a> for an eight-car pileup on the San Francisco Bay Bridge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Lieu, Congress is simply incapable of passing legislation that can regulate AI: The technology moves too fast, and legislators lack the necessary knowledge to set laws and guidelines. Instead, &ldquo;[w]hat we need is a dedicated agency to regulate AI,&rdquo; Lieu wrote. &ldquo;An agency is nimbler than the legislative process, is staffed with experts and can reverse its decisions if it makes an error. Creating such an agency&nbsp;will be a difficult and huge undertaking because AI is complicated and still not well understood.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lieu cited other agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as evidence that the government could still regulate a new and emerging technology. But, he said, the process could not happen overnight. Instead, Lieu said he would recommend the formation of a non-partisan AI Commission to provide recommendations on how such a federal agency could be formed, what it should regulate and what standards could apply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology has already published an AI Risk Management Framework, a non-binding document that Lieu proposes that government build upon and add compliance mechanisms to. &ldquo;We may not need to regulate the AI in a smart toaster, but we should regulate it in an autonomous car that can go over 100 miles per hour,&rdquo; Lieu wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Already, ChatGPT has <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/ai-program-earned-passing-bar-exam-scores-on-evidence-and-torts-can-it-work-in-court&amp;xcust=2-3-1481564-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">almost passed the bar exam</a>, scoring a 50.3 percent correct response rate. (A score of 68 percent is required to pass.) Artists are concerned that AI art may threaten their own commissions. Is it possible Lieu is hoping to regulate AI before it comes for his job, too?</p>\n\nProfessional Software</div>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1476048/this-old-windows-keyboard-shortcut-clears-your-clipboard-fast.html", "title": "Clear your Windows clipboard fast with this handy trick", "date_published": "2023-01-23 19:30:00+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>I spend a lot of time on my computer. And, in course of the day, I might copy to my clipboard any number of things not meant for sharing&mdash;sensitive information like passwords or 2FA codes, text from an early article draft, or a private quote from a friend. Out of self-preservation, I nuke those contents as soon as I&rsquo;m done with them, just in case I pass the wrong information to the wrong person at the wrong time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could clear the clipboard in Windows 10 or 11 via the Clipboard settings (type &ldquo;clipboard&rdquo; into the Start Menu or search menu) and I would if I had the options for <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394506/how-to-use-windows-10s-clipboard-history.html\"><em>Clipboard history</em></a> and/or <em>Sync across devices</em> turned on. It&rsquo;s the only way to thoroughly flush those saved bits and bytes.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Windows 10 Clipboard settings\" class=\"wp-image-1476089\" height=\"736\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/clipboard_settings_W10.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>To clear the clipboard thoroughly when the options for <em>Clipboard history</em> or <em>Sync across devices </em>are on, you&rsquo;ll need to use that <em>Clear</em> button in this settings menu.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>However, since I purposely keep my clipboard offline and as bare-bones as possible, I wipe my history with an even faster method. It happens via a decades-old (but still incredibly powerful) Windows keyboard shortcut: <code>Win + R</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That command brings up the Run box in Windows, into which I paste this command: <code>cmd /c \"echo off | clip\"</code> and then hit the <code>Enter</code> key. It blanks out the clipboard&rsquo;s single entry.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage center\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"Windows 10 Run box\" class=\"wp-image-1476056\" height=\"206\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/runbox.png\" width=\"399\" /><figcaption>The Run box + this text command wipes your clipboard&rsquo;s last entry on your PC.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>After you&rsquo;ve done this once, you can hit that same <code>Win +R</code>, <code>Enter</code> combo within a literal second&mdash;assuming you don&rsquo;t use the Run box for anything else. If you do, you can still arguably clear the clipboard faster with this keyboard shortcut. The command stays in the Run box&rsquo;s history, so you should be able to hit <code>Win + R</code>, type &ldquo;cmd&rdquo; to bring up the entry, select it with the <code>down arrow</code> key, and then hit <code>Enter</code> almost as quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This little trick may sound complicated, but it really isn&rsquo;t. I use it multiple times in a day and doing so has saved my bacon a few times from sharing something I didn&rsquo;t mean to because I got my active windows mixed up while using using <code>Alt + Tab</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s another great keyboard shortcut to have in memory&mdash;if you don&rsquo;t already know it and other fantastic time-savers, check out our list of <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/397396/windows-tips-optimizations-save-time.html#toc-5\">the top Windows keyboard commands</a> you should know.

But the deal may come with a price for users, too: a $42/mo &ldquo;professional&rdquo;-tier subscription that sources say OpenAI is testing among early adopters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, Microsoft said it would invest $1 billion into OpenAI, then a relatively unknown developer of AI technologies. On Monday, Microsoft said it would extend its partnership through a &ldquo;multiyear, multibillion dollar investment to accelerate AI breakthroughs.&rdquo; &ldquo;Microsoft will deploy OpenAI&rsquo;s models across our consumer and enterprise products and introduce new categories of digital experiences built on OpenAI&rsquo;s technology,&rdquo; the company said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We already know that Microsoft has used AI technology as part of <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1419066/microsoft-designer-is-almost-a-masterpiece-already.html\">Microsoft Designer, the visual-content creation system that PCWorld went hands-on with</a> last year. But Microsoft&rsquo;s commitment implies that AI technology could be rolling out as part of Microsoft&rsquo;s other products, including Office, as we suggested last year.

Since then, ChatGPT has been used to write essays, produce code, and apply its knowledge tasks ranging from law to text-based games. It has been banned (and embraced) at universities, with students incorporating it into their workflow for better or for worse. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact that ChatGPT would eventually evolve into a paid version wasn&rsquo;t a well-kept secret: Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/sama/status/1599669571795185665&amp;xcust=2-1-1481398-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">tweeted</a> last December that the service would be monetized at some point to offset costs. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">we will have to monetize it somehow at some point; the compute costs are eye-watering</p>&mdash; Sam Altman (@sama) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/sama/status/1599669571795185665?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=2-1-1481398-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">December 5, 2022</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Multiple users have begun to report, meanwhile, that OpenAI has begun to offer a paid plan at $42 per month.

While motherboard prices have gone up, the features you&rsquo;re getting on this will certainly make it a fantastic value. Forgoing the gaming aesthetics is a nice trade-off for the added functionality on the Z790-Creator WiFi. Let&rsquo;s go over the most essential features and what to know:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CPU choice</strong>: You&rsquo;ll get a wide range of CPU choices on this ATX motherboard with support for both Intel&rsquo;s 12th and 13th generation. That&rsquo;s good news. Budget-friendly choices like a 13600K or the powerful Intel i9 13900K will be great here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>DDR5 RAM and PCIe Gen 5</strong>: Next-generation DDR5 RAM and PCIe Gen 5 are also here, giving you all the benefits of the next-gen Z790 platform. DDR5 RAM has great speeds that many workstation-class applications can take advantage of, and with recently decreasing pricing, it&rsquo;s a great future-proof option to have. If you&rsquo;re planning to do 4 DIMMs for large amounts of RAM, carefully check the QVC list to make sure you won&rsquo;t face compatibility issues as DDR5 can still be a bit picky. Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll be able to snap in up to 128GB of RAM goodness!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also there are double 16x PCIe Gen 5 slots, with the Q-Release button&mdash;an awesome addition for easily popping in/out GPUs. This is important for content creators who need to power their one GPU&mdash;or even two GPUs. (Yes, that&rsquo;s a thing for workstations!) You&rsquo;ll be able to put in an add-in PCIe card in the Gen 5 slot, too. You&rsquo;ll get 8x/8x speeds if you populate both, which should be enough for most use cases.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>In a sea of gaming-centric motherboards with options some users may not need, it&rsquo;s refreshing to see a fine-tuned motherboard that has a bevy of highly useful specs&mdash;such as Thunderbolt 4, 10GbE, and four NVMe slots.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Storage</strong>: Content creators love storage, and you&rsquo;ll have that in abundance here. If the eight SATA ports are too &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; for your liking, you&rsquo;ll be pleased to know of the four onboard NVMe slots. These are PCIe Gen 4, but that&rsquo;s more than enough speed for most modern drives. (PCIe Gen 5 drives are still not here to saturate these ports.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many AMD X670E motherboards do offer PCIe Gen 5 NVMe slots, but as of right now, that&rsquo;s not needed&mdash;so don&rsquo;t fret when you see PCIe Gen 4.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>USB ports</strong>: Content creators absolutely need USB ports&mdash;the faster, the better. Starting with Thunderbolt 4 (compatible with USB4), you&rsquo;ll get two of those ports here. At 40Gb/s, this is amazingly fast for file transfers. Adding to that, Thunderbolt has a large eco-system of peripherals such as external enclosures, hard drives, and even display-out for monitors. These are all highly valuable for creators.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Standard USB ports are also abundant here, six on the rear in addition to the two Thunderbolt 4 ports.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use the Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports for displays, and you&rsquo;ll get an HDMI 2.1 port, as well&mdash;another great bonus.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Asus ProArt Z790 Creator WiFi\" class=\"wp-image-1473432\" height=\"759\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2022-12-28-at-3.54.22-PM.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Networking</strong>: Continuing with the impressive features, 10GbE and 2.5GbE networking are present here. This is a rarity on gaming motherboards, as only the most expensive ones provide 10GbE&mdash;and even less with a second ethernet option. This is where you can see tremendous value for those content creators who need 10GbE for NAS backups and other high-usage networking&mdash;like sharing drives in an editing studio for example.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wi-Fi 6E is also included, rounding out a perfect complement of networking options that is a fantastic inclusion for the price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audio</strong>: Audio is competent here as well, with enough inputs on the rear for most casual use cases. (Five jacks, to be precise!) You&rsquo;ll get a good Realtek S1220a codec within what Asus calls &ldquo;Crystal Sound 3&rdquo;&mdash;plus good build quality on those components. Of course, professional audio users will still want to use external or add-in higher-grade audio components.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Other interesting features</strong>: Quality-of-life features are here too. Q-Latch for M.2 drives, and Q-Release for the PCIe GPU slots, both of which make for easier access for these components. An integrated I/O shield also improves the build experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BIOS Flashback and Q-LED make diagnosing issues easier, even though users of this motherboard are less likely to manually overclock. (But you still can!)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The unboxing experience is simple but provides the necessary accessories you need to get going. SATA cables, display adapter cables, the usual.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, the board offers a robust feature set that greatly benefits content creators and workstation users.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"asus-proart-z790-creator-wifi-design\">Asus ProArt Z790-Creator WiFi: Design</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Asus ProArt Z790 Creator WiFi\" class=\"wp-image-1473433\" height=\"851\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2022-12-28-at-3.53.42-PM.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>A no-frills design, but the Asus ProArt Z790 Creator WiFi comes with a ton of functionality.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Asus ProArt Z790-Creator WiFi does not have any flashy RGB, but you still do get Aura Sync RGB headers. It does have plenty of &ldquo;class&rdquo; and a really unique design. With a wonderful subdued color scheme, and some minor gold accents running throughout, it looks purposeful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unique aspects of the design include the transparent I/O shield enclosure and lower-right &ldquo;ProArt&rdquo; branding. Both look great, but do keep in mind that this motherboard feels less &ldquo;robust&rdquo; in the hands than something like an Asus ROG Hero for example. Those &ldquo;gamer&rdquo; motherboards typically feel a lot heavier due to the &ldquo;armor&rdquo; and other aesthetic/cooling pieces. Build quality is still great here, however&mdash;but we can see some cost savings were needed to include the robust feature set. (And that&rsquo;s great&mdash;we&rsquo;d rather see the features!)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The design is also functional, with M.2 drive slots sporting cooling thermal pads underneath. Design innovations such as the Q-Latch and Q-Release are also fantastic, providing a great ease-of-use when adding M.2 drives and PCIe cards.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Asus ProArt Z790 Creator WiFi\" class=\"wp-image-1473434\" height=\"738\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2022-12-28-at-3.55.53-PM.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p></p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The rear of the integrated I/O shield (another great design bonus!) is clearly labeled and matches the rest of the motherboard aesthetic. The back is standard, as expected&mdash;you&rsquo;d have to head over to ROG or higher-end gaming motherboards to find a more armored backplate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, the minimalist color tones are still very interesting when you zoom in and take a closer look. No need for RGB effects here; but still elegant-looking in any build.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"asus-proart-z790-creator-wifi-performance-software-and-bios\">Asus ProArt Z790-Creator WiFi: Performance, software, and BIOS</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Asus ProArt Z790 Creator WiFi\" class=\"wp-image-1473443\" height=\"826\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2022-12-28-at-3.54.59-PM.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Asus ProArt Z790-Creator WiFi is not marketed as an overclocking monster. With 16+1 dual power stages, it will handle even the mighty Intel i9 13900K with ease&mdash;and overclock, too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rest of the Intel 12th- and 13th-gen family will also fit right in, with competent VRM heatsinks and good-quality PCB.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DDR5 support gives you access to the latest speed improvements over DDR4. With prices getting better, it&rsquo;s starting to be a very appealing option. Workstation users who can utilize fast RAM will be happy, and only those needing more than 128GB will need higher-end platforms like Xeon or Threadripper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The performance chops don&rsquo;t stop there, with PCIe Gen 5 and Gen 4 throughout. While the two PCIe 16x slots are both Gen 5, the third one is Gen 4. You&rsquo;ll also get Gen 4 performance out of the four onboard NVMe slots&mdash;which is more than enough as Gen 5 is not quiet here yet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speed continues where it matters: 40Gb/s dual Thunderbolt 4 ports are the pinnacle of current transfer/USB technology. This will make content creators very happy who rely on fast transfer rates and the versatility of Thunderbolt.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 10GbE is some of the fastest networking you&rsquo;ll find anywhere, and it accompanies a 2.5GbE secondary port. This type of performance is exactly what workstation users demand, and here it&rsquo;s available in spades. Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 are also some of the fastest standards currently available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you may not need gaming-level overclocking, the Asus BIOS is excellent and gives you tons of options. You can manually tinker with your unlocked Intel CPU, or even play with the DDR5 RAM. Easy to use and intuitive, it&rsquo;s an enthusiast favorite. Sure, it&rsquo;s not a ROG Extreme motherboard, but it has the basics to get you rolling.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t intend to tinker, the minimum needed is just to set the XMP profile for your RAM. You can also set Ai automatic overclocking in the BIOS if you wish to squeeze some more performance out of your CPU. Keep in mind this may be adaptive and depend on your cooling solution&mdash;these newer higher-end Intel CPUs such as the 13900K can run hot!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leaving the BIOS, you&rsquo;ll still get some good system integration on the software side with the Asus ProArt Creator Hub. Like Asus Armory Crate on the gaming side, this software will allow you to customize fan profiles, monitor hardware, and tons of other options.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"should-you-buy-the-asus-proart-z790-creator-wifi\">Should you buy the Asus ProArt Z790-Creator WiFi?</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Asus ProArt Z790 Creator WiFi\" class=\"wp-image-1473435\" height=\"827\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2022-12-28-at-3.55.05-PM.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The $469 MSRP is targeted at content creators making this a highly attractive option. In a sea of gaming-centric motherboards with options some users may not need, it&rsquo;s refreshing to see a fine-tuned motherboard that has a bevy of highly useful specs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also game on it quite well, too. It has the same DDR5 and support for the fastest Intel gaming CPUs that the best gaming motherboards offer. You&rsquo;ll just have a little bit less onboard RGB!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thunderbolt 4 has tons of speed and utility, and you&rsquo;ll only find it on the most expensive gaming motherboards. Likewise with 10GbE networking&mdash;these two options will appeal to the content creators for sure. You&rsquo;d need an &ldquo;extreme&rdquo; level gaming motherboard just to have these options at a much higher price!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other included features are also highly useful&mdash;in addition to the latest-generation DDR5 and PCIe Gen 5 technology, it&rsquo;s got a generous four NVMe slots, and plenty of SATA ports.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may even have some gamers who think this is a great buy&mdash;and we&rsquo;d agree&mdash;with tons of functionality built in for the price. Content creators will of course be very pleased, and have the tools needed to create!</p>\n\nDesktop PCs</div>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1481151/grab-an-xbox-elite-2-controller-for-just-a-hundred-bucks.html", "title": "Calling all gamers!

If you&rsquo;re so inclined, you can spend a ridiculous amount of money on a controller with more bells and whistles than a music shop. But for PC gamers, the Xbox Elite Wireless controller is probably still the best choice. And you&rsquo;re in luck because it&rsquo;s currently on sale at Woot.com for $30 off. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the newest iteration of the Elite Wireless Series 2, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1367331/xbox-elite-controller-series-2-core-review.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the &ldquo;Core&rdquo; version</a>. It doesn&rsquo;t have many bells and/or whistles: the package doesn&rsquo;t include the interchangeable thumbsticks, D-Pad, rear paddles, carrying case, and charger base. But it&rsquo;s still a damn good controller with super-premium materials like a rubberized grip and it can be custom-programmed via the Xbox Accessories app for Windows. Unlike some other premium controllers, it works with <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09ZKX3HK2/&amp;xcust=2-1-1481151-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">the official Xbox wireless dongle</a> to give you lightning-fast wireless without resorting to Bluetooth. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a long-time user of this design, it&rsquo;s well worth the $30 premium over the standard Xbox Series X/S controller. And if you want to add in all the extra hardware, you can do so with the Component Pack (<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BNL8YXFS/&amp;xcust=2-1-1481151-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">for a hefty $60 or so</a> &mdash; still a considerable saving off the retail price). Alternately, if price is no object and you&rsquo;re not in love with the black-on-white coloration of this discount, the Xbox Design Lab now lets you order the Elite 2 controller with <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1357573/microsoft-xbox-elite-controller-now-comes-in-custom-colors.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">all kinds of crazy color combinations</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that if you do want the Woot deal, it&rsquo;s only available today, January 23rd, or until supplies run out.

But it you want to see what the future of AI-powered search engines are, <em>right now</em>, you need to try out You.com.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What you need to know about <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://you.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1448609-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">You.com</a> is that it isn&rsquo;t <em>just</em> a search engine. Yes, You.com will search the Web, and even deeper within the content of Web sites like StackOverflow for specialized searches like code snippets. But You.com integrates a <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1424575/chatgpt-is-the-future-of-ai-chatbots.html\">ChatGPT-like AI engine</a> called YouChat right into the site, along with a complementary writing tool and even an AI art generator. It&rsquo;s richer search &mdash; and much, much more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You.com still feels a little like a collection of parts, without the absolutely airtight cohesion of its larger competitors. But &mdash; and this is important, too &mdash; you currently won&rsquo;t find any ads that clutter the top search results of Google and Bing, and the site seems refreshingly free of &ldquo;gamed&rdquo; or promoted search results that prioritize terminology over information. You.com makes money via affiliate links, an optional monthly subscription to its writing tool, and a slice of revenue from showing Walmart ads on shopping searches. You.com certainly feels like the early days of Web services before commercialization robbed them of their pristine appeal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You.com does offer the opportunity to make an account and log in each time you access the site, and provides plugins <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/youcom/ffoiecgjambohnpffggcdidbomhmcack&amp;xcust=2-1-1448609-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">for Microsoft Edge</a> and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/youcom/afiglppdonkdbkkaghbnpklddbemkbpj&amp;xcust=2-1-1448609-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">for Google</a> to use You.com as the default search engine. With a service like Google, login information controls access to Google Workplace, Gmail, stored third-party passwords, and more. At You.com, the site promises that it will apply AI in the background to better understand what you&rsquo;re looking for, and presumably keep tabs on what you&rsquo;ve asked for within YouChat. Registration tells You.com how to apply its AI filters to your ongoing searches, and gates off AI art unless you&rsquo;ve signed up. That&rsquo;s basically it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a look at what You.com has to offer&mdash;starting with the basics, then delving deep into the nifty AI-infused areas of the search engine and other differentiators.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"you-com-basic-search-a-different-way-of-searching\">You.com basic search: a different way of searching</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You.com&rsquo;s basic search engine takes a bit of getting used to. If you search for a result like &ldquo;best laptops,&rdquo; &ldquo;best smartphones,&rdquo; or &ldquo;best used cars,&rdquo; not only are the results different, but the order in which the results appear differ, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a traditional search engine like Bing or Google, the engine returns a list of pages where you can hopefully find the answer to your question. For a query like &ldquo;best used cars,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s still true. But with the other two searches, You.com returns a mixture of search results and &ldquo;apps,&rdquo; which are curated collections of content. Some apps are just traditional sites, like CNET.com, for example. Others seem a bit more dubious, like curated reviews of smartphones via a service called Looria, which just curates opinions from Reddit. The layout is a bit confusing, especially as it&rsquo;s not always clear which pages You.com is prioritizing, especially when the search results are arranged vertically but app results are arranged horizontally, scrolling off the page to the right.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-jetpack-image-compare\"><div class=\"juxtapose\"><img alt=\"You.com main page\" class=\"image-compare__image-before\" height=\"886\" id=\"1469010\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Main-page.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1529\" /><img alt=\"You.com Main page 2\" class=\"image-compare__image-after\" height=\"1259\" id=\"1469019\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Main-page-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1930\" /></div><figcaption>You.com organizes searches differently depending on what it knows, what you&rsquo;re searching for, and your history.

You.com allows you to search via &ldquo;All,&rdquo; &ldquo;Images,&rdquo; &ldquo;Videos,&rdquo; &ldquo;News,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Maps&rdquo; &mdash; pretty standard for a search engine. But it&rsquo;s the list of secondary categories &mdash; &ldquo;Write,&rdquo; &ldquo;Code,&rdquo; &ldquo;Imagine,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Chat,&rdquo; where You.com starts to shine. In &ldquo;Code,&rdquo; for example, it&rsquo;s extremely useful for You.com to surface the StackOverflow &ldquo;app&rdquo; where a list of (hopefully) related queries have already been answered by the site&rsquo;s users.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-jetpack-image-compare\"><div class=\"juxtapose\"><img alt=\"You.com YouCode\" class=\"image-compare__image-before\" height=\"1042\" id=\"1469014\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/YouCode-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1830\" /><img alt=\"You.com YouCode 2\" class=\"image-compare__image-after\" height=\"1035\" id=\"1469015\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/YouCode-2-better.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1818\" /></div><figcaption>You.com&rsquo;s Code Search wasn&rsquo;t bad, though it seemed like signaling it by adding the term &ldquo;code&rdquo; improved the results. (Swipe back and forth to see multiple images)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, StackOverflow didn&rsquo;t show up all that frequently in my &ldquo;Code&rdquo; searches. You can increase the frequency that it will by clicking a small &ldquo;thumbs up&rdquo; button next to it. But doing so increases the frequency in which the site will show up in <em>all</em> searches, according to the tooltext. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d want StackOverflow opinions cluttering other, more generic searches. Apps can also be blocked as well, and your preferences will be saved if you log in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other hindrance to using You.com as a general search engine? It&rsquo;s slow. For one, results may take a second or two to load. But apps are also sometimes agonizingly slow to load their own results, leaving a slab of gray, pulsing results right in the middle of your screen as they load.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"you-coms-social-search-a-genuine-strength\">You.com&rsquo;s social search: a genuine strength</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, You.com includes a Social search engine that&rsquo;s a genuine winner. Perhpas surprisingly, neither Google nor Microsoft Bing offer a search category to scour the world&rsquo;s most popular social sites, and You.com does a surprisingly nice job here. Search for &ldquo;Katie Porter,&rdquo; for example&mdash;the woman who apparently will try to oust California&rsquo;s Dianne Feinstein from her Senate seat&mdash;and You.com lists a bang-bang-bang list of Porter&rsquo;s presence on TikTok, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit posts, YouTube, Quora, Twitch, and more. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"You.com Social Search\" class=\"wp-image-1469018\" height=\"778\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/You-Social-Katie-Porter.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>A You.com Social search for &ldquo;Katie Porter&rdquo;.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>You&rsquo;ll most likely find more up-to-date information on, say, the &ldquo;Latest&rdquo; tab on Twitter about any live reactions or news about a particular topic.

(You.com doesn&rsquo;t really say what YouChat is based upon.) But it&rsquo;s pretty clear that its functionality is close, even if the responses differed in tone and the excuses given for, say, why they were unable to provide Sandra Bullock&rsquo;s telephone number. Both chatbots, for example, can come up with several reasons in response to &ldquo;tell me why I should go to bed early tonight,&rdquo; and both could &ldquo;write a poem about peace and sunsets.&rdquo; Both generated code when asked for &ldquo;code for how to the extract the most populous cities.&rdquo; And both provided a detailed response when asked &ldquo;How did the French Revolution affect the English aristocracy?&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-jetpack-image-compare\"><div class=\"juxtapose\"><img alt=\"You.com YouChat 1\" class=\"image-compare__image-before\" height=\"1080\" id=\"1469017\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/YouChat-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1929\" /><img alt=\"You.com YouChat 2\" class=\"image-compare__image-after\" height=\"1058\" id=\"1469016\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/YouChat-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1932\" /></div><figcaption>You.com&rsquo;s YouChat in action.

But it&rsquo;s worth noting that You.com offers both; typing in the last query via YouChat and You.com&rsquo;s main search engine surfaced a nice <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bl.uk/romantics-and-victorians/articles/the-impact-of-the-french-revolution-in-britain&amp;xcust=2-1-1448609-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">British Library article</a> on the effects of the French revolution on the English aristocracy.  (ChatGPT used to offer longer essays, if asked, though the service now seems to cut them off at about 500 words or so. YouChat simply stopped midway through a request for a &ldquo;750-word essay&rdquo; on the above subject. It also seemed to generate an error message if overused, too: &ldquo;Oops, I&rsquo;m still learning and I couldn&rsquo;t generate an answer right now. Please try again.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The point, though, is that You.com is paving the way for other search engines: providing factual answers and links in one context, and more &ldquo;thought out&rdquo; responses in another. It&rsquo;s an interesting, effective dichotomy. Still, it&rsquo;s worth noting that neither ChatGPT nor YouChat guarantee the accuracy of their response, and neither provides sources. &ldquo;This product is in beta and its accuracy may be limited,&rdquo; YouChat says. &ldquo;You.com is not liable for content generated.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reports say that <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1446692/report-microsoft-is-making-bing-its-next-ai-app.html\">Microsoft Bing will eventually implement ChatGPT</a>. If it does, you can look to You.com and YouChat as one example of what it might look like. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"youwrite-basic-ai-powered-content-creation\">YouWrite: basic AI-powered content creation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>YouWrite reminds me very much of <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1424421/ai-text-generation-is-moving-mainstream.html\">Canva&rsquo;s Magic Write</a> &mdash; an AI-powered tool to generate copy of various types (blog, essay, paragraph, social media post), tones (professional, neutral, friendly, persuasive), and to specific types of audiences (which you define). Is there a difference between YouChat and YouWrite? In some ways, no: you can ask either YouWrite or YouChat to explain why nihilism should be one&rsquo;s preferred philosophy, for example, and the YouWrite tool simply added 100 or so more words to the question. Remember, YouWrite is a paid tool, but seemed to reset my allowance of AI-authored pieces (ten at any one time) when I simply relaunched the site. (I wasn&rsquo;t logged in.)</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"You.com YouWrite\" class=\"wp-image-1469011\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/YouWrite-OLED-TVs.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>YouWrite won&rsquo;t replace PCWorld yet, thankfully, though it does a decent job correlating information.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>YouWrite could stand to use some improvement, though. Asking it to write the nihilism essay generated 350 words. But they were hardly coherent, and that was true for multiple questions. No one is going to use this:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&ldquo;Finally, embracing a nihilistic outlook on life allows one appreciate its complexity instead of trying find simple solutions everything . Rather than relying on predetermined answers given by authorities figures like parents teachers , one has opportunity reflect deeply upon situations before coming up with conclusions themselves after taking into account all relevant facts at hand this approach enables people become more independent thinkers better able handle problems arise throughout course daily existence ultimately leading healthier happier lifestyle overall.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>If You.com is going to ask users for money (and it is, at $2/week for 1,000 writing samples) they&rsquo;re going to have to make sense. YouWrite is a waste of money at present, even as cheap as it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"youimagine-quick-simple-ai-art\">YouImagine: Quick, simple AI art</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If there&rsquo;s one reason to sign up for a You.com account, it&rsquo;s the Imagine feature, which absolutely requires you to sign up for an account before it begins generating art.  (You can still generate art in &ldquo;private mode,&rdquo; though you still have to be signed in to do so. Entering incognito mode in your browser, then trying to generate art via Imagine, doesn&rsquo;t work.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The site doesn&rsquo;t seem to put any limits on how many images it generates, or how frequently it generates them, but the quality varies fairly significantly. Not only does the site only generate 768&times;768 images, but there are no advanced options like higher resolution, inpainting, adjusting the steps or the cfg scale, or any examples of stylistic output. There&rsquo;s also no indication from where they&rsquo;re sourced. Still, the images are delivered in just a few seconds.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-jetpack-image-compare\"><div class=\"juxtapose\"><img alt=\"You.com YouImagine\" class=\"image-compare__image-before\" height=\"1124\" id=\"1469012\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/YouImagine-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1908\" /><img alt=\"You.com YouImagine 2\" class=\"image-compare__image-after\" height=\"1102\" id=\"1469013\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/YouImagine-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1926\" /></div><figcaption>There are other, better, AI sites out there, though the lack of strict content restrictions (for now) can be fun to play around with. The accuracy, though, isn&rsquo;t really there. (Swipe back and forth to see multiple images)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You.com doesn&rsquo;t seem to put any restrictions on the use of celebrity likenesses, though they&rsquo;re not always accurate. Pictures that would be considered NSFW are simply not displayed, with no explanation. Violent images (&ldquo;a farmer murdering another farmer, lots of blood&rdquo;) were rendered, somewhat surprisingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You.com doesn&rsquo;t appear to store any images rendered with Imagine, though you have the option to download them via a small icon in the corner. Once they&rsquo;re gone, though, they&rsquo;re gone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"is-you-com-worth-a-click-absolutely\">Is You.com worth a click? Absolutely</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Will You.com be the service that sinks Google or Bing? Probably not. But You.com offers so much &mdash; with improvements in certain facets of basic search as well as its more advanced features &mdash; that it could easily move into the second or even the top tier of search engines. DuckDuckGo offers something unique, an emphasis on privacy, that has helped it gain recognition. But You.com may be able to use its AI capabilities to distinguish itself as well.
