Harley Quinn: A Very Problematic Valentine's Day Special will premiere on HBO Max on February 9.</p><p>Harley Quinn Season 3 was all about Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy navigating the early stages of a relationship when both brought so much baggage with them.

<p dir="ltr">Thanks to Avatar: The Way of Water's box office success, Zoe Saldana has become the first actor to have four movies earn more than $2 billion. <a href="https://people.com/movies/zoe-saldana-first-actor-with-four-movies-over-2-billion-box-office/">People</a> was among the first to report, with Saldana's other films to reach this milestone including 2009's Avatar, 2019's Avengers: Endgame, and 2018's Avengers: Infinity War.</p><p dir="ltr">Zoe Saldana, 44, has an impressive resume that spans both Avatar and Marvel universes (where she plays Gamora), plus Star Trek (where she portrays Nyota Uhura in the J.J. Abrams reboots). She plays Neytiri in the Avatar films, which has more sequels on the way after the newest entry in the series has proven to be extremely profitable. (Director James Cameron <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-avatar-2-be-a-success-13-years-after-the-first-i-guess-were-going-to-find-out-director-says/1100-6507638/">wasn't sure if it would</a>.)

"I'm very grateful for the opportunities that they provided, from collaborating with amazing directors and getting to meet cast members that I consider friends and getting to play a role that fans, especially children, love," Saldana said. "But it also meant that I felt artistically stuck in my craft of not being able to expand or grow or challenge myself by playing different sorts of genres and different roles."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zoe-saldana-becomes-first-actor-to-star-in-four-movies-that-have-made-2b-or-more/1100-6510802/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>A new survey indicates that Blizzard might be gauging interest for a massive, restructuring update for Warcraft 3 Reforged.</p><p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow/news/blizzard-survey-indicates-potential-warcraft-3-reforged-relaunch/">Warcraft Tavern</a>, Blizzard put out a survey asking what features players would most like to see in Reforged. The question asks how appealing of each of the listed features are, from a scale of very unappealing to very appealing. Suggested features include global custom games, an art update, UI/UX revamp, a storage size reduction, and an environmental art rework. The survey also asks players whether a "soft relaunch" with many of these features would motivate them to play or purchase.</p><p>The survey also asks various other questions about the remake of the classic RTS game. For example, whether they have purchased the game, how much they've played it, and what has held them back from playing the game.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-might-be-floating-a-warcraft-3-reforged-relaunch/1100-6510801/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Bloody Santa Claus movie Violent Night already has a sequel in the works. According to <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/violent-night-sequel-update-tommy-wirkola/">The Wrap</a>, Norwegian director Tommy Wirkola (Dead Snow, Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters) is indicating that a follow-up is coming, in development, and is already at the contract phase.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're talking about it and we're just making deals and getting everything in order," Wirkola said. "We have time to really crack the script and figure out the story. We have some ideas… we've been talking about where we want to take it and what we want to see."</p><p dir="ltr">For example, Wirkola says, the next movie could feature ideas they intentionally "left on the floor" like the North Pole, Mrs. Claus, and elves. The original film, which premiered in theaters on December 2 and came to video-on-demand on December 20, was largely set at a Connecticut mansion. "Story-wise I think we have a really, really cool idea that expands on the world and scope, but still keeping that tone that we love from the first one," Wirkola said.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/violent-night-2-already-in-development-report/1100-6510799/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

In order to accomplish this goal, you're going to need to equip your units with the best possible weapons, which means you're going to need to upgrade them.

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fire-emblem/">Fire Emblem Engage</a> has finally arrived, letting you take on the role of the Divine Dragon in your quest to defeat the Fell Dragon and save the continent of Elyos. As you explore the different nations of Elyos, you will have the opportunity to donate some of your hard earned gold in exchange for better rewards on the battlefield when in that nation's territory. While the cost might be steep, the rewards are necessary if you want to be successful in battle. Here's everything you need to know about the Nation Donations system in Fire Emblem Engage.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Big spending for increased rewards</h2><figure style="width: 1280px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4090042-fenationdonation.jpg"><img alt="While the Nation Donation upgrades are expensive, they drastically increase the amount of materials found in the region." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4090042-fenationdonation.jpg" /></a><figcaption>While the Nation Donation upgrades are expensive, they drastically increase the amount of materials found in the region.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">The Nation Donations menu can be found at the bulletin board in the Café Terrace at your home base of Somniel.

These donations are quite expensive, starting at 5,000 Gold, but quickly reaching 10,000, 25,000, and even 50,000 before you will reach the next level. Considering there are four nations you can donate to, this can become costly very quickly, but the rewards are necessary.</p><p dir="ltr">The rewards you receive come in two parts.

Squire on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/secrets-of-marvel-studios-with-kevin-feige/id1642247504?i=1000593811522">The Movie Business Podcast</a>, Feige says the superhero movies based on comics are in many ways just getting started, noting that the decades of Marvel history gives the studio a broad well to draw from.</p><p><span>"I've been at Marvel Studios for over 22 years, and most of us here at Marvel Studios have been around a decade or longer together," Feige said (via </span><a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/marvel-kevin-feige-superhero-fatigue-1235499609/">Variety</a><span>). "From probably my second year at Marvel, people were asking, 'Well, how long is this going to last? Is this fad of comic book movies going to end?'"</span></p><p dir="ltr">Feige continued, "I didn't really understand the question. Because to me, it was akin to saying after Gone With The Wind, 'Well, how many more movies can be made off of novels? Do you think the audience will sour on movies being adapted from books?' You would never ask that because there's an inherent understanding among most people that a book can be anything. A novel can have any type of story whatsoever. So it all depends on what story you're translating. Non-comic readers don't understand that it’s the same thing in comics." Feige added that Marvel Studios is in a position where it can make "any type of movie that shares two things: the Marvel Studios logo above the title and a seed of an idea from our publishing history."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kevin-feige-doesnt-think-people-will-get-tired-of-comic-book-movies/1100-6510794/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## GTA Online On PC Is Currently Compromised With Security Exploits

<p>Grand Theft Auto Online is currently undergoing a security breach caused by exploits affecting the PC version. Rockstar-Games-focused account TezFunz2 <a href="https://twitter.com/TezFunz2/status/1616535689503600640">tweeted</a> on Friday that the exploits can allow cheaters to remotely add, remove, and modify other peoples' stats. This, potentially, could also lead to accounts being permanently corrupted, which can cause a ban or deleted profiles.</p><p>In a <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/10hsosu/mass_reporting_the_dangerous_pc_exploit/">Reddit</a> thread, which has become quite popular during the past few days, user PapaXan asks people to help in mass reporting the issue to Rockstar Support. Many players have been sharing their experiences on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/10h7tfd/warning_for_all_pc_players/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">Reddit</a> and elsewhere, pointing out that enabling a firewall to play is mandatory. That being said, it's recommended to avoid playing altogether to avoid any issues.</p><p>Aside from the in-game cost of compromised accounts, TezFunz2 also <a href="https://twitter.com/TezFunz2/status/1616575783215964166?s=20&amp;t=8A4XWZPx_NcGfACnGGm0oA">pointed out</a> that the exploit could let users affect PCs with malware and other accesses. This is thanks to a discovery from <a href="https://twitter.com/Speyedr_AU/status/1616686368243224576?s=20&amp;t=8A4XWZPx_NcGfACnGGm0oA">Speyedr</a>, who developed a firewall tool for Grand Theft Auto 5 called Guardian. While this new exploit doesn't seem to bypass Guardian, there is a chance that inexperienced players could install the firewall incorrectly, allowing access to the exploit by mistake. "In the meantime, take a break and/or play something else," Speydr recommends.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-online-pc-malware-security-exploit-compromise/1100-6510790/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

The "interactive sports documentary" is narrated by Cena, which should make it an entertaining experience whether you're in the ring or going behind the scenes of his blockbuster career.</p><p>Beyond following (and fighting) Cena, the usual assortment of game modes will be included, although a fully reworked story mode might become the big draw of this installment. The WarGames match type is also making its debut, which features 3v3 or 4v4 matches inside two side-by-side rings surrounded by a double-steel cage.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>WWE 2K23 Preorder Bonuses</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1702/17023653/4089830-wwe2k23feature%281%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>If you preorder WWE 2K23, you’ll get the Bad Bunny Bonus Pack.

He added: "We looked at concept art where there’s this implication of the fungus growing under the skin. What if that was the thing? It's not so much about the bite, they just need these tendrils to go from one host to another and that's how the infection spreads."</p><p>The show's other creator, Craig Mazin, said HBO's Last of Us series didn't retcon the game because spores are indeed mentioned and exist in the TV show world.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-tv-show-creators-discuss-backlash-about-changes-from-the-game/1100-6510788/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Steam Rhythm Game Mistakenly Bills Players Daily For Monthly Subscription

<p dir="ltr">Bad Steam games come and go all the time, but it takes a special game to break through the noise with a single-digit positive review percentage. However, it seems that rhythm game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2016940/O2Jam_Online/">O2Jam Online</a> is quite deserving of this dubious distinction, as multiple players have reported the game billing them for their subscription every day--despite the fact that they purchased a month-long sub.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">oh dear. o2jam steam has crossed a new line in terms of incompetence - apparently if you purchase the monthly subscription.. it bills you for it every day...<a href="https://t.co/x0zEHza9HW">https://t.co/x0zEHza9HW</a></p>  — TaroNuke @ NOISZ STΔRLIVHT 2.0💥 (@TaroNuke) <a href="https://twitter.com/TaroNuke/status/1616318956762980354?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">January 20, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">To be clear, O2Jam Online is a hard sell even besides this apparent billing mistake. An attempted reboot of a PC rhythm game series that had a strong cult following in the 2000's, O2Jam features no multiplayer, despite the "Online" in its title. This is a bold move, considering that multiplayer was O2Jam's signature feature back in the day. <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2016940/reviews/?browsefilter=toprated&amp;snr=1_5_100010_">Players</a> have also reported gradual desync between the song and button presses--a major issue for a rhythm game--missing note charts for certain modes, and an overall slapdash feel.</p><p dir="ltr">What's more, it doesn't allow you to buy access to the songs outright--the only option is weekly or monthly subscriptions, which apparently overcharge you. Players have also noted that the game's entire presentation appears to be ripped directly from the mobile version of the game, and that it doesn't display correctly on modern monitors.

<p>It's the end of an era at Disney World and Disneyland, as the popular Splash Mountain ride is now closed for good ahead of its rebrand based on Princess and the Frog.

<p dir="ltr">The Sonic the Hedgehog games have come in many forms over the years, from the momentum-based platforming of 2D Sonic to the boost and homing attack-fuelled mayhem of 3D Sonic. In two recent tweets, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sonic-frontiers/">Sonic Frontiers</a> director Morio Kishimoto indicated that he would like to revisit the formula of the Sonic Adventure series.</p><p dir="ltr">Responding to a tweet from a fan who asked about the boost gameplay of 3D Sonic games, Kishimoto <a href="https://twitter.com/moq_46/status/1617434056085602305">stated</a> that he debated whether or not to use boosts in Frontiers. He further stated that he is thinking of making a 3D Sonic game that doesn't use boosts, and that he would like to make a game in the style of the <a href="https://twitter.com/moq_46/status/1617485596255227904?s=46&amp;t=4bhLne5nvBdhTKSo7KxwFQ">Adventure series</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">While it's unclear how exactly this desire might (or might not) be reflected in the next few Sonic games, the series has tried several different approaches to 3D gameplay over the years.

The last game in the Adventure series, Sonic Adventure 2, came out in 2001, though fans often argue that the infamous Sonic 2006 is essentially an unofficial Sonic Adventure 3 that sunk the formula, forcing Sega to try something new with the next entry, Sonic Unleashed.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-frontiers-director-would-like-to-make-an-adventure-style-game/1100-6510777/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The next game in the SteamWorld series is another radical departure from what came before: a frontier city-builder-called SteamWorld Build. You'll make a bustling wild west city above ground, while mining and dealing with monsters who lurk just below the surface. SteamWorld Build is coming to PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch in 2023, and a demo is available on Steam now.</p><p>As the mastermind of a SteamWorld mining town, you'll create housing and provide food for your citizens and make sure they stay entertained. Meanwhile, you'll need to venture underground to explore an old abandoned mine, in search of ancient technology that could save your fledgling community from certain doom. Gather ores and other resources from below ground, and use them to build up your town on the surface--with the ultimate goal of getting off-planet entirely.</p><p>Publisher Thunderful notes that the game was built on PC and consoles simultaneously to make sure that it all works as well with a mouse and keyboard as it does with a controller. You can also pick from three difficulty levels to make it inviting to sim-builder newbies as well as veterans.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steamworld-build-announced-for-2023-release-demo-available-now/1100-6510759/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## CoD: Modern Warfare 2 Will Bring Back Hardcore Mode With Season 2 Update, Devs Confirm

<p dir="ltr">Infinity Ward has confirmed that Call of Duty's Hardcore multiplayer mode will be returning with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii/">Modern Warfare 2</a>'s Season 2 update, which is set to arrive on February 15.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 launched without the game's typical Hardcore playlist for multiplayer. Season 1 added a similar mode called Tier 1, but the mode plays more like Modern Warfare 2019's Realism mode, with the lack of hit markers and a kill feed. There's also a change to health, as Tier 1 seemingly provides more health than a standard Hardcore mode.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">No HUD? No problem. Hardcore is back!<br /> <br />Follow Season 02’s Multiplayer updates in our studio blog later this week.</p>  — Infinity Ward (@InfinityWard) <a href="https://twitter.com/InfinityWard/status/1617220677517381632?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">January 22, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">While the tweet from the developer doesn't confirm if the health and HUD will be exactly the same as previous years, players should likely expect a more classic experience than Tier 1. Infinity Ward also confirmed that more information about Season 2 and Hardcore mode will be revealed in a blog post later this week.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-modern-warfare-2-will-bring-back-hardcore-mode-with-season-2-update-devs-confirm/1100-6510776/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Mysterious Sega Countdown Site Looks Like A Dreamcast VMU, Might Tease New Cosmic Smash

<p dir="ltr">Sega has launched a mysterious countdown website centered around something called "C-SMASH VRS," with the countdown set to expire on February 13 at 8 AM PT / 11 AM ET.</p><p dir="ltr">The site features a grid of gray dots on a white background, with a few dots turning orange into the triangular "Play" symbol. Once clicked, the dots create multiple shapes, sound waves, and display the countdown clock within them.</p><figure style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4089839-csmashvrs.jpg"><img alt="An eye will sometimes appear on the countdown site." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4089839-csmashvrs.jpg" /></a><figcaption>An eye will sometimes appear on the countdown site.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">The dots--and the animations within--bear a resemblance to the animation motif of the Sega Dreamcast's Virtual Memory Unit memory cards, though there's no evidence to suggest any relation. "C-SMASH," however, does resemble Cosmic Smash, a puzzle game made by Sega for arcades in 2001, which was then ported to the Sega Dreamcast in 2003. Cosmic Smash also featured a similar color scheme to the teaser site.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mysterious-sega-countdown-site-looks-like-a-dreamcast-vmu-might-tease-new-cosmic-smash/1100-6510775/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">HBO's TV adaptation of The Last Of Us has been remarkably successful so far, garnering both rave reviews and high marks from viewers. As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-last-of-us-part-1-sales-jumped-238-after-tv-show-launch-uk-boxed-charts">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, it seems that the hit show has juiced interest in the games as well, with The Last Of Us Part 1 sales jumping more than 200% on PS5 and The Last of Us: Remastered (the PS4 version of the game) increasing by more than 300% on the boxed UK sales charts.</p><p dir="ltr">These increased numbers pushed the PS5 version of the game to number 20 on that UK chart, and the PS4 version to number 32. Neither were on the charts at all the previous week. If you're curious, the top five games on the chart were Fire Emblem Engage, FIFA 23, God of War Ragnarok, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. Besides The Last Of Us, the biggest risers in the charts were Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle and Battlefield 2042.</p><p dir="ltr">In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-last-of-us-hbo-show-review-faithful-additive-and-excellent/1900-6418015/">The Last Of Us TV show review</a>, critic Mark Delaney praised its presentation, writing, and faithfulness to the original game.

"As some of you already know, at the end of last year I decided to leave BioWare. These past 19 years have been a life-changing experience to say the least, and it made the choice to go very difficult. I've worked with so many wonderful people and had the privilege to be a part of the most amazing teams and projects. It's hard to fathom it all, and I know I'll be reflecting on it for years to come."</p><p>Walters thanked his past colleagues and said he wishes "everyone at BioWare the very best in everything you do."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-loses-production-director-as-19-year-veteran-mac-walters-is-leaving-bioware/1100-6510762/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The hierarchy of the infected in The Last of Us contains several threats to Joel and Ellie on their journey throughout the game and now the HBO adaptation. In this week's episode, we meet the second stage of infection with clickers.</p><p>They are called such for the noise that they use almost like echolocation. As we learned in Episode 2, they can't see due to the hardened fungus over their eyes, but they can hear you, so in the game, dealing with them involves plenty of stealth and shivs to take them down quietly. We got our first quick look at clickers in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/hbo-maxs-the-last-of-us-trailer-breakdown/2900-4354/">first trailer for the series</a>, and fans praised the screen accuracy of the prosthetics.</p><p>"To present the clickers on screen correctly, my feeling was we had to make 5,000 decisions exactly right," explained showrunner Craig Mazin. "We brought Barrie Gower in...who had worked on our prosthetics on Chernobyl. He's the best."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-hbo-made-sure-to-get-the-clickers-to-look-perfect-in-the-last-of-us/1100-6510769/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

This scene sets the tone for the rest of the trailer, which combines frenetic action with a large number of goofy jokes.</p><p dir="ltr">Featured scenes include a number of devious traps familiar to any D&amp;D player, a battle against a dragon and other terrifying beasts, plenty of swordfights, and even a cameo by a mimic. As a whole, it seems that the film's goal is to combine the chaotic, raucous atmosphere of a good D&amp;D campaign with an engaging heist tale. Given the success of similarly themed D&amp;D stories like Acquisitions Incorporated, it's an interesting direction for the film, but we'll have to wait and see if it sticks the landing.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-dungeons-dragons-movie-trailer-shows-off-wacky-heist-action/1100-6510764/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Aubrey Plaza, most recently seen in Emily the Criminal and The White Lotus: Season 2, made her first hosting appearance on Saturday Night Live this past weekend. And she decided to reprise one of her most well-known characters in April Ludgate from Parks and Recreation for the show.</p><p dir="ltr">Plaza portrayed April again to begrudgingly talk about local government on Weekend Update. But true to her character, she was annoyed to discuss how people can get involved so told co-anchor Colin Jost to talk to Leslie Knope (portrayed by Amy Poehler) instead.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">Knope, of course, was overly enthusiastic to show up on Weekend Update. But she was more excited to pick Jost's brain about what SNL is like versus discussing her own fictional work. Knope also made sure to ask if President Joe Biden saw her from a previous segment on SNL. For those unfamiliar with Parks and Rec, she had a huge crush on the then-vice president for the show.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/see-aubrey-plaza-and-amy-poehler-revive-their-parks-and-rec-characters-on-snl/1100-6510763/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>As January reaches the finish line, one of the biggest games of 2023 is ready to kick the year off with blockbuster style and attitude. Forspoken, Square Enix's latest action-RPG is officially releasing on January 24, and a number of reviews for the ambitious title have gone live.</p><p>The good news is that Forspoken is a technical marvel with fun combat and spectacular visuals according to critics, but the game falls short in other areas. The lukewarm reception for Forspoken paints it as a solid game overall, a flashy showcase for magical parkour that disappoints when it comes to storytelling.</p><p>"It tells a largely forgettable story that sets up major stakes but fails to offer a compelling reason for why the player should care," Jordan Ramée wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/forspoken-review-forsaken/1900-6418019/">Forspoken review</a>. "Luminous Productions' action-RPG feels great when it allows you to really stretch your legs and magically parkour across its fantasy landscape, but combat is clunky and regular exposition too often stalls the action."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/review-roundup-for-forspoken/1100-6510761/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Not much is known about Cyberpunk 2077's upcoming expansion <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077s-phantom-liberty-expansion-features-idris-elba/1100-6509911/">Phantom Liberty</a>, which is doubling up on its Hollywood star power by having Keanu Reeves back as Johnny Silverhand and Idris Elba playing FIA Agent Solomon Reed, but CD Projekt Red says that this expansion has the biggest budget it has ever allocated to post-launch content.</p><p>Speaking to Polish outlet <a href="https://www.parkiet.com/technologie/art37801671-cd-projekt-o-nowym-dodatku">Parkiet</a> (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-cdpr-biggest-dlc/">TheGamer</a>), CDPR's Marek Bugdol first called the spy-thriller DLC the "biggest ever DLC" that CDPR had worked on so far. In an update on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/10gqu1y/cdpr_confirms_that_phantom_liberty_is_the_biggest/">Cyberpunk 2077 subreddit</a>, community director Marcin Morton clarified the statement and said that Phantom Liberty "is about the biggest budget when it comes to expansion packs we’ve released," and that CD Projekt Red will reveal more information about the scale of the DLC in the future.</p><p>Phantom Liberty has a high bar to climb as CDPR's Witcher 3 expansions, Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine, have long been considered to gold standards in this space. CDPR's reputation took a major beating after Cyberpunk 2077 was released in December 2020 in a less-than-optimal state, but currently, the game is in a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077s-redemption-arc-is-a-breathtaking-return-to-form-for-cd-projekt-red/1100-6510079/">much better and healthier state</a> after receiving significant patches and updates.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-is-cdprs-biggest-budgeted-expansion-yet/1100-6510726/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Forspoken Review - Forsaken

<p>Though it takes inspiration from isekai--stories in which people from Earth are transported to and become trapped in a fantastical world (think Alice in Wonderland but Japanese)--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/forspoken/">Forspoken</a> ultimately doesn't understand what makes that genre so popular. Instead, it tells a largely forgettable story that sets up major stakes but fails to offer a compelling reason for why the player should care. Luminous Productions' action-RPG feels great when it allows you to really stretch your legs and magically parkour across its fantasy landscape, but combat is clunky and regular exposition too often stalls the action.</p><p dir="ltr">In Forspoken, protagonist Frey finds herself trapped in the magic-filled world of Atheia after stumbling through a portal. There, she bonds with a sentient brace she nicknames Cuff and then encounters a group of survivors living in the last city that's free from the effects of a dangerous miasma. This blight, which Frey calls the Break, covers the land and transforms living creatures into mutated monsters. Frey is the only exception, making her an ideal candidate for exploring the Break, finding its source, and destroying it. The whole situation is an intriguing narrative set-up but boring or unlikable characters let it down. It's difficult to like the standoffish and stubborn Frey, the incessantly sarcastic Cuff (who regularly quips in Frey's ear like a discount JARVIS), or any of the survivors who are all too eager to completely rely on Frey's protection from the Break while also asking her to complete boring optional tasks like going on a tour of a lifeless hub or petting a bunch of sheep.</p><p dir="ltr">Forspoken's story is one about belonging--finding a place you want to stay and a people you wish to protect. Like any isekai protagonist worth their salt, Frey is initially resistant to her new surroundings before discovering that she's actually ideally suited to the world she's found herself trapped in. However, it's not a world that the game is able to adequately convince the player of wanting to stay in and protect. The emotional connection Forspoken tries to establish to incentivize the player to take action--to help the people that need Frey's help--is deeply uninteresting and oftentimes head-scratching and odd. The characters don't take the threat of Atheia's imminent destruction very seriously and any tension that comes from their perilous existence is repeatedly undermined by meaningless busywork they want you to do. The characters themselves are also incredibly plain with two-dimensional personalities. They have no real convictions or anything interesting to say.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/forspoken-review-forsaken/1900-6418019/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/forspoken/">Forspoken</a> is a new action RPG published by Square Enix, and you'll be able to explore its large open world for tens of hours, as long as you don't focus solely on the main story. You'll step into the shoes of Frey Holland, a young New Yorker who gets transported to the mystical world of Athia. And once Athia fully opens up, you'll find plenty of loot to grab and challenges to complete. Here's what you need to know about how long Forspoken takes to beat, including a chapter list you can follow so you know how much you've got left.</p><h2>How long is Forspoken?</h2><p>Forspoken contains <strong>13 main story chapters</strong>, many of which include several time-sensitive Detours--side quests from notable NPCs. Here's the full list of chapters along with their titles:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Chapter 1: Attachments</li><li dir="ltr">Chapter 2: Stuck</li><li dir="ltr">Chapter 3: The Interloper</li><li dir="ltr">Chapter 4: What Must Be Done</li><li dir="ltr">Chapter 5: Might and Main</li><li dir="ltr">Chapter 6: Damned If You Do…</li><li dir="ltr">Chapter 7: The Hue of Blue</li><li dir="ltr">Chapter 8: The Truth Will Out</li><li dir="ltr">Chapter 9: Breaking Point</li><li dir="ltr">Chapter 10: None the Wiser</li><li dir="ltr">Chapter 11: Forspoken</li><li dir="ltr">Chapter 12: Awakening</li><li dir="ltr">Chapter 13: New Beginnings</li></ul><p>Judging by our experience, Forspoken will take <strong>around 20 hours to complete</strong> if you stop to take on a few Detours here and there. For our ongoing guides playthrough, we also didn't yet fully explore all four regions of the map before seeing the credits roll at the end of the main storyline.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-long-to-beat-forspoken-chapter-list-and/1100-6510746/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>After six weeks at the top, Avatar: The Way of Water again held onto its position as the number one film at cinemas and has now crossed the $2 billion mark at the global box office. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avatar-the-way-of-water-surpasses-spider-man-no-way-home-as-sixth-biggest-film-of-all-time/1100-6510675/">Knocking Spider-Man: No Way Home down to seventh place</a>, the latest milestone for the Avatar sequel makes it director James Cameron's third film to join the $2 billion box office club, alongside the first Avatar movie and Titanic. Outside of Cameron's films, the rest of that elite group of blockbusters includes Avengers Infinity War, Avengers: Endgame, and Star Wars: The Force Awakens.</p><p>At its current trajectory, Avatar 2 could end its theatrical run at fifth or fourth place, surpassing Infinity War and The Force Awakens, respectively. It likely won't dethrone the original Avatar though, as that movie is still the highest-grossing film of all time with a huge record of $2.9 billion from global box office ticket sales, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avatar-2-will-easily-be-profitable-so-james-cameron-is-moving-ahead-with-the-sequels/1100-6510387/">Cameron is ready to move forward with Avatar 3, 4, and 5</a>.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/2023W03/">Box Office Mojo</a>, Avatar 2 took in $20 million from North American cinemas over the weekend, while Puss in Boots: The Last Wish grabbed second place in its fifth week on the circuit. Killer AI companion M3GAN dropped to third place with a $9.8 million domestic haul, and globally, has made over $124.6 million so far.Two new arrivals on the cinema scene did some respectable numbers overall, as dramatic thriller had a fourth-place debut with $9.3 million domestically, and the anime feature film debut of That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime earned $1.4 million when it landed in eighth place.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avatar-the-way-of-water-passes-2-billion-worldwide/1100-6510756/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/killers-of-the-flower-moon/umc.cmc.5x1fg9vferlfeutzpq6rra1zf">Killers of the Flower Moon</a>, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro and directed by Martin Scorsese, is one of 2023's most anticipated movies. The film tells the story of the Reign of Terror in the 1920s when members of the Osage Nation were murdered one by one after huge deposits of oil were discovered under their land. The movie changed significantly over the course of its production due to the input of local Osage Nation members, star Lily Gladstone says.</p><p><a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/killers-of-the-flower-moon-osage-nation-changed-scorsese-vision-lily-gladstone-1235496848/">Speaking to Variety</a>, Gladstone said Scorsese worked closely to members of the Osage Nation, with chief Geoffrey Standing Bear serving as a consultant on the film. The film was shot on location in Oklahoma.</p><p>"The work is better when you let the world inform the work," Gladstone said. "That was very refreshing how involved the production got with the [Osage Nation] community. As the community warmed up to our presence, the more the community got involved with the film. It's a different movie than the one [Scorsese] walked in to make almost entirely because of what the community had to say about how it was being made and what was being portrayed."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-leonardo-dicaprio-film-killers-of-the-flower-moon-is-a-different-movie-after-osage-nation-input/1100-6510757/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
