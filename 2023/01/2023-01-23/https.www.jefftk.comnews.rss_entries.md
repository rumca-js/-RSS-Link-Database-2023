When someone's coming for over for dinner, I'll ask about their
dietary restrictions. In my social groups it's common for people to be
vegetarian or vegan, and others have a food allergy, are gluten-free,
etc.  Occasionally, however, I find myself making food without knowing
my constraints.  Perhaps someone's "bringing a friend" or when I asked
they said "my food situation is pretty complicated, I can eat after if
there's nothing that works for me."  In these cases one option is to
serve a meal that works for a wide variety of dietary restrictions.

<p>

I wouldn't want to only cook like this: every restriction you put on
your cooking makes it harder. (Not specific to cooking!) Still, there
are a few meals that do work well this way. For example, this is the
main situation where I'll cook baked potatoes with stuff to put on
them:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<ul>
<li>Baked potatoes
</li>
<li>Black beans
</li>
<li>Cheese sauce
</li>
<li>Ground beef or bacon
</li>
<li>Caramelized onions
</li>
<li>Roasted cherry tomatoes
</li>
<li>Chopped scallions
</li>
<li>Olives
</li>
<li>Sour cream
</li>
<li>Baby spinach
</li>
</ul>



<p>

This is normal American food, but because each person chooses what
goes on their plate it works for nearly everyone: vegetarians leave
out the meat, vegans leave out the cheese and cream, low-carb people
leave out the potato, <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/oh3YWqobjHAjNvNqd/potato-diet-a-post-mortem-and-an-answer-to-smtm-s-article">potato-only
people</a> just eat the potato, there's no gluten, etc.  Which exact
sides you choose don't matter too much as long as you think a bit
about dietary categories.  I'm probably listing a few more than I
would normally make.

</p>

<p>

If I didn't want to make potatoes I'd do tacos/burritos, without
trying for something authentic.  This could be:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<ul>
<li>Corn tortillas, briefly heated
</li>
<li>Flour tortillas, same
</li>
<li>Black beans
</li>
<li>Grated cheese
</li>
<li>Ground beef, chicken, or carnitas
</li>
<li>Pico de gallo
</li>
<li>Salsa
</li>
<li>Roasted bell pepper slivers
</li>
<li>Guacamole [1]
</li>
<li>Sour cream
</li>
<li>Baby spinach
</li>
</ul>



<p>

And yes, this has a lot in common with the previous meal, but the
spices are pretty different and I wouldn't mind serving them on
consecutive days.

</p>

<p>

Other meals where there are a lot of options on the table and each
person chooses their own combination also work. The main things I keep
in mind are trying to keep each component relative simple, having at
least two protein options, at least one vegan protein option, and at
least one non-glutenous starch option.

[1] I usually don't make guacamole, because I don't really like it and
I prefer not to prepare food I don't enjoy. It's not that I object to
other people enjoying things when I don't, it's that <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/how-i-cook">my cooking involves</a> a lot of tasting things
and that strategy falls apart if you can't tell which direction is
better. But it definitely belongs on this list if I'm not cooking, and
even when I am a housemate will often make some.
