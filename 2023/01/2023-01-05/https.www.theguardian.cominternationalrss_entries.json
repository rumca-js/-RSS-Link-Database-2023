But it seemingly escalated violently after Harry accused William of acting like an heir: the chosen one, around whom everything else seemingly revolves. There isn\u2019t a sibling alive who won\u2019t, on some level, recognise that feeling. But the twist in this case is that resentment is inexorably baked into a hereditary monarchy from birth. Its strength but also its weakness is that it exercises power through a family, with all the primordial and potentially destructive emotions that entails.</p><p>Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/05/prince-harry-royal-fist-fight-power-monarchy-heir\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/05/fay-weldon-death-novels-women", "title": "Fay Weldon: a defiant writer who was thoroughly wised-up", "date_published": "2023-01-05 15:41:29+00:00", "description": "<p>The novelist, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/04/writer-fay-weldon-dies-aged-91\">who has died aged 91</a>, channelled the apocalyptic power of the betrayed and rejected \u2013 making her novels immensely liberating<br /><br />\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/04/fay-weldon-author\">Fay Weldon: the fearless glass ceiling cracker who loved being outrageous</a></p><p>\u2018I have an easy disposition and a gregarious nature,\u201d explained Fay Weldon in response to a question about how to navigate life in the public eye from Hilary Mantel, with whom she was in conversation at Bath Spa University in 2014. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXMHruJvI94&amp;ab_channel=BathSpaUniversity\">Film of the event is online</a>, and there is something wonderful about seeing the pair, originals both, laughing in their academic gowns, so unalike in many respects but both so intently focused on their work, and on their keen apprehension of the binds and double-binds in which women have found themselves through the ages.

Just as affected have been her readers, many of whom have been remembering the first time they encountered the liberating power and irreverence of novels such as Puffball, The Cloning of Joanna May and The Lives and Loves of a She-Devil.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/05/fay-weldon-death-novels-women\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/05/rishi-sunak-keir-starmer-new-year-face-off-settles-nothing", "title": "Sunak was no match for Starmer in their first new year face-off.

That means lawmakers have not been sworn in for the 118th Congress that began on January 3, including all the brand new representatives elected for the first time in the midterms.</p><p><strong>McCarthy is still negotiating</strong>, hoping to offer enough concessions to the 19 or 20 rightwing rebels on his own side who refuse to vote for him.

Her parents are gorgeous, glamorous leftwing academics, while she feels like a misfit. Her grades are poor, she has little interest in anything other than novels (\u201cI like all novels,\u201d she tells her teacher, who points out that there is a bit more to succeeding at school than that), and, worse, she worries she is becoming ugly, having overheard her father, Andrea, expressing concerns that she is starting to look like her mysterious Aunt Vittoria, a woman evidently absent from their cosy family life. While Giovanna is so filled with teenage apathy she begins the series as a walking, barely talking shrug, Vittoria sparks her interest, and sets her off on an adventure that will explode her steady life as she knows it.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/05/the-lying-life-of-adults-netflix-review-another-impeccable-elena-ferrante-tv-show\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/05/wolves-julen-lopetegui-unhappy-at-liverpools-longer-rest-before-fa-cup-tie", "title": "Wolves\u2019 Julen Lopetegui unhappy at Liverpool\u2019s longer rest before FA Cup tie", "date_published": "2023-01-05 12:00:20+00:00", "description": "<ul><li>Wolves visit Anfield with two days\u2019 fewer to prepare</li><li>Manager wants new midfield faces after Traor\u00e9 injury</li></ul><p>Julen Lopetegui has questioned the fairness of Liverpool having two extra days to prepare for Saturday\u2019s FA Cup third-round tie after bemoaning Wolves\u2019 congested schedule.

It\u2019s this perception of the Stooges founder and \u201cGodfather of punk\u201d that\u2019s most cemented in the public consciousness. In recent years, though, the now 75-year-old singer has seemed on a mission to do anything but rock with his shirt off: he turned unlikely jazz crooner for 2009\u2019s <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13084-preliminaires/\">Pr\u00e9liminaires</a>, sang Edith Piaf and Beatles covers in French on 2012\u2019s Apr\u00e8s and echoed his superlative 1970s David Bowie collaborations on 2016\u2019s Josh Homme-helmed <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21586-post-pop-depression/\">Post Pop Depression</a>.

On his last solo album, 2019\u2019s quietly reflective <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/iggy-pop-free/\">Free</a>, he recited poetry by Lou Reed and Dylan Thomas \u2013 although it\u2019s hard to tell whether he kept a shirt on while doing so.</p><p>All of this makes it slightly eyebrow-raising that, at 75, Pop has suddenly returned to harder rocking. When many of his contemporaries are dead or mining their hits in order to continue touring stadiums, rock\u2019s eternal free spirit promises \u201cmusic made the old-fashioned way\u201d, which will \u201cbeat the shit out of you\u201d. His choice of musical foil for this endeavour is one Andrew Watt, the Grammy-winning super-producer whose recent clients have included Miley Cyrus, Morrissey and Elton John. It doesn\u2019t seem the most obvious fit, although Watt\u2019s pedigree with legacy rockers includes Ozzy Osborne\u2019s recent return-to-form solo albums, and he has been highly enthusiastic about working with Pop, a \u201ctrue fucking icon\u201d. As executive producer, co-writer, guitarist and pianist, Watt has made Iggy Pop\u2019s music sound contemporary but not at the expense of his inimitable voice and character.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/05/iggy-pop-every-loser-review-atlantic-gold-tooth-19th-solo-album\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/jan/05/channel-4-privatisation-plans-formally-abandoned", "title": "Channel 4 privatisation plans formally abandoned", "date_published": "2023-01-05 11:59:49+00:00", "description": "<p>Culture secretary Michelle Donelan reverses proposals set out under predecessor Nadine Dorries in Boris Johnson\u2019s government  </p><p>Plans to privatise Channel 4 have been formally abandoned, ending years of threats to the broadcaster that cost the government millions of pounds and were opposed by the vast majority of the media industry.</p><p>The culture secretary, Michelle Donelan, said Channel 4 was a \u201cBritish success story and a linchpin of our booming creative industries\u201d and therefore <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/jan/04/culture-secretary-recommends-dropping-channel-4-privatisation-plans-say-reports\">should not be sold</a>.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/jan/05/channel-4-privatisation-plans-formally-abandoned\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jan/05/edin-dzeko-napoli-first-loss-internazionale-serie-a", "title": "Dzeko serves up Napoli\u2019s first loss as Inter leave no scraps in midweek feast | Nicky Bandini", "date_published": "2023-01-05 11:45:29+00:00", "description": "<p>Edin Dzeko\u2019s header proved decisive as the Serie A leaders started 2023 by seeing their lead at the top cut to five points</p><p>The midseason World Cup interruption felt that little bit longer to many Italian football fans, left without a team to cheer for, so Serie A\u2019s organisers opted for total immersion on its return.

How could he send him off with memories to savour?</p><p>It was a strange Christmas in the Diamond household, because for the first time in 23 years as a parent, my family wasn\u2019t complete. My 18-year-old son Charlie was spending it with his girlfriend and pals 3,000 miles away on the other side of Canada, so he was away for three weeks. This made me sad, for me, but also happy for him that he is mature enough to make these decisions. One of the aims of parenting is to get your kids into a position where they want to leave home and are able to do so, and my son is a man now.</p><p>So, we had a Charlie Diamond Christmas before he left. Whatever he wanted to do, we would do.

January is for future-facing resolutions. March is for spring cleaning \u2013 mental as well as physical. September is about re-engaging with work, perhaps seeing it differently it after a break. The guiding principle is that clinical psychology isn\u2019t just for fixing dysfunctional situations; you can also use it to improve functional ones. If you feel a bit off-kilter but not quite bad enough to spend hundreds of pounds on therapy, Maddox\u2019s tips and tricks from the consulting room could be for you. Not only do the book\u2019s modest claims make it likable, but the fact that it isn\u2019t trying to sell you some pumped-up, perfect version of yourself has the effect of making it seem trustworthy too. </p><p>A Year to Change Your Mind was written during the pandemic and is suffused with an air of staying calm while the world is having a freakout. Maddox feels like a solid companion. She self-discloses, but not too much \u2013 just enough to let you know that the person behind all the sensible advice has had a hard time too. She alludes to the hardcore problems she confronts in her work with young people in hospital settings, not to set up an us-and-them hierarchy of suffering, but to show what we can learn from people who face serious battles with their inner and outer circumstances. It\u2019s easy to see how these people might benefit from Maddox\u2019s insight and kindness. She doesn\u2019t show off at all \u2013 you can just deduce from her manner on the page that she\u2019s someone you\u2019d want on your team in a crisis. </p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/05/a-year-to-change-your-mind-by-dr-lucy-maddox-review-a-way-through\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/05/delta-airlines-union-wages-record-profits", "title": "Delta workers accuse airline of \u2018culture of fear\u2019 amid attempts to unionize", "date_published": "2023-01-05 11:00:18+00:00", "description": "<p>Workers face stagnant wages and short staffing despite the airline enjoying soaring profits coming out of the pandemic</p><p>Workers at Delta Air Lines are <a href=\"https://teamster.org/2022/11/delta-air-lines-workers-organize-with-teamsters-afa-and-iam/\">currently holding </a>union organizing drives, citing tough working conditions in the US airline industry in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and stagnant wages despite the airline making hefty profits.</p><p>The unions are in the process of collecting a majority of union authorization cards to merit a union election with the National Mediation Board, announcing a joint collective effort several weeks ago.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/05/delta-airlines-union-wages-record-profits\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/05/second-cabinet-minister-chris-heaton-harris-says-twitter-account-hacked", "title": "Second cabinet minister says Twitter account hacked", "date_published": "2023-01-05 10:54:02+00:00", "description": "<p>Northern Ireland secretary Chris Heaton-Harris says sorry after account posts \u2018deeply unpleasant stuff\u2019</p><p>A second cabinet minister has said they fell victim to hackers and was forced to apologise after their Twitter account posted a series of offensive tweets about race, sexuality and gender identity.</p><p>Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, said others temporarily gained access to his account and posted some \u201cdeeply unpleasant stuff\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/05/second-cabinet-minister-chris-heaton-harris-says-twitter-account-hacked\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/jan/05/keir-starmer-labour-sticking-plaster-politics-rishi-sunak-uk-politics-latest", "title": "Keir Starmer attacks Westminster\u2019s \u2018sticking plaster politics\u2019 and promises \u2018real change\u2019 in major speech \u2013 UK politics live", "date_published": "2023-01-05 10:51:45+00:00", "description": "<p>Latest updates: Labour leader says he plans to move away short-term decision making </p><p><strong>Starmer</strong> says voters looked at Labour again in 2022.

It\u2019s still dark, and there is no traffic to contend with, but I feel as if I could nod off at any moment. I arrive at the hospital, a large regional hospital in the east of England, and put on my uniform \u2013 a shapeless blue polycotton tunic with ill-fitting trousers and a pair of old running shoes. I walk on to the ward at 7am to find the night team still busily rushing around. The night has been terrible, they say \u2013 patients have been up and down constantly.</p><p>I glance at the staffing board. The orthogeriatric ward, for elderly people with fractures, has a capacity of 28 patients, spread across bays and side rooms. For staffing purposes, the ward is split into two roughly equal halves. On my half of the ward, there is a nurse and two healthcare assistants \u2013 I\u2019m one of them \u2013 to help with basic patient care. I feel the tension in my shoulders dissipate slightly as I see that I\u2019m due to work with a friendly and capable colleague, and I feel today might not be as bad as yesterday.
