<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunDontWalk">run by
default</a>: it's faster, why wouldn't you?  I think this is also a
good approach to apply in real life, at least over short distances.
It saves you time and it's a bit of exercise.  Over pretty much any
distance short enough that I'm not going to break a sweat I'll run.

I've done some of this most of my life (I can still hear my middle
school principal shouting to stop running in the
hallway&#8212;<i>Jeeeeff-reeeey!</i>) though over the last five years or
so I've pushed myself to do it <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/running-and-optimizing">more</a> <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/weight-strategies">consistently</a>. The more I do it the
easier it gets, and the shorter commutes become.

But probably not more than 30% of people, though?

(Prompted by a coworker talking about the inconvenience of an 8min
distance between two buildings at work that I think of as a 2-3min
distance.)
