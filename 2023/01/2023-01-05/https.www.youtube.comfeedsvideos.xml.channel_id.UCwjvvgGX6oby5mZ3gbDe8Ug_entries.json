Previously we analyzed that the bodies incinerated in one city, Beijing alone, were about 4,000 or so per day. Now, except for a few high-ranking officials who can be cremated alone, the rest are all mixed together with two or three bodies at one go. So the daily death toll in Beijing alone is already around 10,000, not to mention that so many crematoria around China are at full capacity, on the edge of collapsing. \nSo is this all a natural phenomenon? Are there more secrets behind it? \n\nHave questions? Do you have something to share with us about China?
