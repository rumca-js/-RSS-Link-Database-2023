Tito claimed on the Bubba the Love Sponge radio show that Anna Paulina practices witchcraft and has slept with Rep. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/matt-gaetz-abortion-protest" target="_blank">Matt Gaetz</a>. </p><p>The letter read in part, "You said that Ms. Luna (a devout Christian) practices witchcraft. You are hereby demanded to publicly and immediately retract each and every defamatory statement you made about Ms. Luna on the show. Because you do not have the ability to distribute your retraction widely on your social media, you are demanded to apologize and retract your statements on the <em>Bubba the Love Sponge Show</em> or by making a retraction and apology video that you send to me that Ms. Luna will distribute via her social media.”</p><p>Tito claimed he heard the rumors from Paloma Zuniga, a Hispanics for Trump associate. According to <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/rep-anna-paulina-luna-fights-rival-michael-tito-over-witchcraft-accusation" target="_blank">The Daily Beast</a> and Tito, Zuniga said Anna Paulina "puts spells on people." </p><p>Anna Paulina also posted this video to her Twitter, showing a reporter who followed her out of the Capitol and bombarded her with questions over the witchcraft and sexual allegations. She said, "When you’re a woman who stands up to the swamp, you are sexually harassed leaving your office, accused of having sex with members, being a witch, and more lies. This is why we must drain the swamp. This is not journalism. Is this how female reps are treated?"</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

Braddock allegedly told an activist not to support Anna Paulina because he had access to assassins.

## Warner Bros Reportedly Open to Ezra Miller, Accused of Grooming a 12-Year-Old,  Returning as The Flash

	It looks like we may need a little more of that "cancel culture" than previously thought.
</p><p>
<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ezra-miller-variety-victim" target="_blank">Variety</a> reported that Warner Bros. executives are open to Ezra Miller returning as The Flash: "Given that Miller has stayed out of trouble since beginning mental health treatment in the summer, some executives are amenable to continuing with the actor as the world-saving speedster after 'The Flash' bows on June 16. Aquaman,” “Shazam!,” “Blue Beetle” and Gunn’s “Peacemaker” series for HBO Max all could have a place at the table."
</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cWarner Bros. Discovery executives reportedly open to Ezra Miller continuing as \u2018The Flash\u2019 after release of the film on June 16. \n\n\ud83d\udd17: https://t.co/OQZ4se1E9M\u201d</div> — Pop Crave (@Pop Crave)

</blockquote>
<p>
	As a quick refresher, last year, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ezra-miller-parents-legal" target="_blank">Ezra Miller</a> was charged with disorderly conduct and harassment after screaming at some Hawaiians in a karaoke bar,  arrested on a second-degree assault charge for throwing a chair at a woman's head, and, of course, was accused of grooming an 18-year-old girl since she was twelve.
</p><p>
	 The two met in North Dakota when Miller was 23 and Tokata was twelve. Court documents filed by the parents of Tokata Iron Eyes claimed that Miller gave their underage daughter Marijuana, LSD, and alcohol, and even confiscated her driver's license, car keys, and bank card. The parents also believe Miller left bruises on her body.
</p><p>
	Tokata has denied being groomed or abused by Miller.
</p><p>
	Last June, a mother and her 12-year-old nonbinary child were <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/06/16/protection-order-granted-for-12-year-old-against-ezra-miller-after-cult-claims/" target="_blank">granted</a> a protection order against Miller after their family claimed Miller menaced them. Miller allegedly got into a fight over the cultural appropriation of the term "tribe" and his assertion of the Rastafarian roots of the game Parcheesi. Sounds like a completely normal fellow to me!
</p><p>The possibility of Miller returning to the franchise following these controversies has left fans quite flabbergasted, with one simply writing, "isn't he wanted by the FBI?"</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

## Watch: Tasteless CNN stooge invokes Damar Hamlin's cardiac arrest to attack GOP over Kevin McCarthy drama

One, he is communicating and the VERY FIRST THING he wanted to know is if Bills beat the Bengals.

The other is CNN dickhead John King invoking Hamlin to attack Republicans over a debate.</p><p>Hamlin <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/damar-hamlin-buffalo-bills-charity" target="_blank">went into cardiac arrest</a> after a football collision. While <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/espn-prayer-damar-hamlin" target="_blank">America prayed</a>, medical personnel rushed to perform CPR on the field. John King tried to draw a comparison between that and *checks notes* a Congressional debate about rules.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Disgusting: CNN invokes Damar Hamlin's cardiac arrest to warn against GOP lawmakers.<br />"Imagine those two doctors that we just listened to who treated, and all of the people on the field who treated the Buffalo Bills player if they said, 'no, [I don't want to function as a team]'" <a href="https://t.co/y1xbrSjLu6">pic.twitter.com/y1xbrSjLu6</a><br />— Nicholas Fondacaro (@NickFondacaro) <a href="https://twitter.com/NickFondacaro/status/1611098978195591189?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>Imagine those two doctors that we just listened to who treated, and all of the people on the field who treated the Buffalo Bills player if they said, 'no, [I don't want to function as a team].</blockquote><p>Imagine you eating a bag of dicks.

</p><p>To the extent any member of congress is on "a team," it's not with the other 434 people in the room with them. It's with their constituents. That is what the "rebels" are fighting for. They feel the best way to represent their "team" is by making sure they have the tools to do what's best for their "team." They also believe Kevin McCarthy is not the guy. Agree or disagree, but nothing they are doing is irrational. Not to mention, this is how Congress is supposed to be.</p><p>More importantly, regardless of how corporate media content creators like CNN try to hype things up, NOTHING GOING ON IN CONGRESS IS LIFE OR DEATH. ZERO. It's a freaking debate. It's heated and feels like a neverending debate. As I write this, we are on round nine of voting. But it's a debate. It's not cardiac arrest.</p><p>It's sad because I thought John King was one of the non-douchebags working at CNN. Whoops.</p><p><p>

## Joy Behar, called the 'dumbest woman on TV,' suggests GOPers and straight men are brain-damaged from too much football

<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cThe dumbest woman on TV, Joy Behar, says only 45% of Americans believe tackle football should be legal and most of those people are heterosexual men and conservatives. First, this poll is bullshit, second, the left wing is coming for football. Get ready:\u201d</div> — Clay Travis (@Clay Travis)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/ClayTravis/status/1610754866443612161">1672868861</a>
</blockquote>
<p>This could quite honestly be payback for all the times we've suggested The View may have brain damage, without ever touching a football. But I digress. <br /></p><p>The <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/03/220330103204.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> she's referring to comes from Ohio State University and surveyed about 4,000 adult volunteers from all 50 states. It's true that 45% said tackle football was inappropriate, but <em>for kids. </em>Pro football is America's favorite sport by far, garnering about 17.1 million views per game. </p><p>Behar also somehow missed that Black and lower-income Americans had more positive views of youth tackle football: "Black Americans and those with no more than a high school education were not as negative about tackle football for kids as were white people and the college-educated. Higher-income adults were more likely to not support youth football."</p><p>The lead author said this is likely due to football being a way for the children of less-advantaged families to get ahead in society, and potentially even land a college scholarship. Sounds like our pal Joy might need to check her white cisgender female heterosexual non-obese able-bodied privilege. </p><p>This also sounds like it could be the start of the left's war on football. Clay Travis made some great predictions for the future of woke football on Twitter: </p><p><br /></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cPrediction: In the years ahead, female cheerleaders will become unacceptable on far left wing in this country. Then it will spread rapidly. Good looking, fit women cheering for men will become targets because they perpetuate the patriarchy. Y\u2019all think I\u2019m crazy, bookmark this.\u201d</div> — Clay Travis (@Clay Travis)

What a perfect opportunity to attack your political opponents!</p><p>The Buffalo Bills <a href="https://twitter.com/BuffaloBills/status/1611021908849352704" target="_blank">gave an update on Hamlin this morning</a>, saying he has shown remarkable improvement and appears to be neurologically intact, which is great news. </p><p><p>

<p>So why are these terrible, evil, Republican narcissists refusing to vote for McCarthy? Lauren Boebert says he rejected a proposal that would have given him enough votes. The proposal included a border security and term limits bill.  McCarthy attempted to secure the 218 votes needed by agreeing to some proposals from the House Freedom Caucus, but ultimately, it wasn't enough. </p><p>Boebert also said they asked for the Republican Study Committee’s budget to be put forward, which would balance in seven years, but Kevin McCarthy said no. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rumble">

</p><p>Boebert and her colleagues have come under fire for failing to provide an alternative candidate to McCarthy who could garner 218 votes. Boebert even name-dropped Trump on the House floor, who apparently told her to knock it off. She also sparred with Sean Hannity and said she will not withdraw. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>And Elon Musk got in on the conversation today, tweeting that McCarthy should be Speaker. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Since the House Freedom Caucus doesn't have another viable candidate, it looks like McCarthy will likely end up being Speaker. But it may not hurt to let him stew a bit. Hopefully, he'll come around on some of their terrorist demands, like securing the border of our country and maybe not allowing <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nancy-pelosi-applause-line" target="_blank">geriatric politicians</a> to remain in Congress until they literally can no longer speak or perform basic daily tasks. But who knows, that could be far too radical for our principled Republican leaders.  </p><p><p>

## Watch: Cardi B goes off on anti-inflation rant that is refreshingly based

And a good point delivered to an apolitical audience of fans rarely exposed to good points matters.</p><p>Quick backstory.

Not unlike how she did <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/cardi-b-russia-ukraine" target="_blank">with the Ukraine-Russia skirmish</a>.</p><p>Left-wing and/or apolitical celebrities having the sudden realization of how economics works is a good thing.
