I think this is also a\ngood approach to apply in real life, at least over short distances.\nIt saves you time and it's a bit of exercise.  Over pretty much any\ndistance short enough that I'm not going to break a sweat I'll run.\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nI've done some of this most of my life (I can still hear my middle\nschool principal shouting to stop running in the\nhallway&#8212;<i>Jeeeeff-reeeey!</i>) though over the last five years or\nso I've pushed myself to do it <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/running-and-optimizing\">more</a> <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/weight-strategies\">consistently</a>.
