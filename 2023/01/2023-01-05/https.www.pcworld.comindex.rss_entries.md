<p>HP announced the new consumer-friendly Dragonfly Pro line and, while they look like very svelte and capable machines, the Windows version has me scratching my head in deep confusion. If you look closely at the image below, you&rsquo;ll notice a unique set of hotkeys vertically flanking the right side of the keyboard. These keys are designed to draw up your camera, account info, and so on. The key that baffles me the most is the tech support one (aka 24/7 concierge support) because, according to this <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/4/23537317/hp-dragonfly-pro-chromebook-laptop-price-specs-features&amp;xcust=2-1-1447633-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">article on The Verge</a>, you have to pay extra for it.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="HP Dragonfly Pro" class="wp-image-1447637" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Untitled-design-8.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">HP</p></div>



<p>The concierge key is designed to put you in touch with an HP expert that can help with troubleshooting issues, repairs, and so on. The idea itself is fine and dandy, as I&rsquo;m all for customer support. However, I don&rsquo;t like that you have to pay for it in the first place. It also renders the key useless if you&rsquo;re not paying for the service. Essentially, the hotkey just takes up unnecessary space on the keyboard. It can&rsquo;t be remapped, either. There will likely be a free trial period for this service, but there&rsquo;s no pricing info available yet. It&rsquo;s not all doom and gloom, though. The hardware is pretty nifty, although there&rsquo;s no Intel offerings just yet.</p>



<p>The Dragonfly Pro comes equipped with an AMD Ryzen 7 7736U CPU, AMD Radeon integrated graphics, up to 32GB of RAM, and up to 1TB of SSD storage. The 14-inch display has a resolution of 1920&times;1080 and a maximum brightness of 400 nits. For connectivity options, it features two USB4 40Gbps ports and one USB 3.2 Type-C port. The specs really aren&rsquo;t too shabby. On paper, it looks like it should deliver strong performance. This laptop will also be offered in Ceramic White or Sparkling Black.</p>



<p>The HP Dragonfly Pro will become available later this spring, but there&rsquo;s no word on pricing just yet. HP will reveal this information when it gets closer to the release date.  </p>

## Qualcomm will build satellite service into Android phones this year

<p>Qualcomm has announced Snapdragon Satellite, which will connect select Snapdragon-powered premium smartphones to the Iridium satellite network for emergency texting in the second half of 2023.</p>



<p>What this means is that Android smartphones will be able to duplicate and expand upon <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/11/emergency-sos-via-satellite-available-today-on-iphone-14-lineup/&amp;xcust=2-1-1447817-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Emergency SOS</a>, Apple&rsquo;s satellite service that allows iPhone 14 models to text back and forth with emergency services. </p>



<p>It appears, for now, that Snapdragon Satellite will be limited to the same &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; texting as Emergency SOS offers, which will be extremely handy for hikers or simply those who are driving or living in rural areas. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.cnet.com/tech/tech-industry/james-kim-died-of-hypothermia-autopsy-reveals/&amp;xcust=2-1-1447817-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">CNET editor James Kim died in 2006</a> when he tried to hike 10 miles through snowy Oregon mountains after he and his family were unable to call for help because of poor cell service. (Qualcomm notes that you&rsquo;ll need a &ldquo;clear view of the sky&rdquo; to enable the feature.)</p>



<p>Qualcomm said at CES that the new capability would be tied to next-gen smartphones in &ldquo;select regions,&rdquo; which use the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 Mobile Platform. It will eventually expand to other platforms, including laptops and IoT devices, Qualcomm said. Snapdragon Satellite is planned to support 5G Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN), as NTN satellite infrastructure and constellations become available, for branded services that will vary by carrier and device maker.</p>

## Try this free Microsoft app before spending $500 on Iogear’s new KVM switch

<p>One of the more interesting products that we&rsquo;ve seen at CES 2023 is the Iogear GCMS1922 &mdash; a dual-port KVM switch that attempts to convince you to pay $529.95 to connect a pair of 4K DisplayPort computers using a single keyboard and mouse. We&rsquo;d remind you that you can use an existing no-cost software utility to save yourself that same amount of money.</p>



<p>You can still control a pair of laptops via a docking station by plugging in a Thunderbolt or USB-C cable into either computer. But the 2-Port 4K Dual View DisplayPort Matrix KVMP, as Iogear calls it, is designed to have two PCs on the same desk, with a pair of displays shared between them. The GCMS1922 includes both &ldquo;extension mode&rdquo; &mdash; spanning your PC&rsquo;s output across two displays &mdash; as well as matrix mode, which assigns one monitor to each display. Those are handy features. </p>



<p>The selling point, though, is &ldquo;crossover switching,&rdquo; which allows you to simply move your mouse between displays. In this mode, the GCMS1922 allows you to control the left-hand PC on the left-hand display, automatically switching to control of the entirely separate right-hand PC by moving your mouse &ldquo;across&rdquo; the display. Why do this? In case you have a work laptop on one display, and a personal laptop on the other.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Iogear GCMS1922 KVM switch" class="wp-image-1447900" height="799" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GCMS1922_2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Iogear</p></div>



<p>We&rsquo;d remind you, however, that there are a number of solutions already in the market that can save you substantial amounts of money by choosing them instead. In 2018, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407999/hands-on-how-one-mouse-can-control-multiple-pcs-with-microsofts-mouse-without-borders-app.html">Microsoft debuted Mouse without Borders</a>, a small utility app that not only allows you to do the same thing (provided both computers can be accessed via Bluetooth or WiFi). Mouse without Borders is now called<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35460&amp;ranMID=24542&amp;ranEAID=*l6kYCuH720&amp;ranSiteID=.l6kYCuH720-lk.jqXfYklwYs6j3uH6lcQ&amp;epi=.l6kYCuH720-lk.jqXfYklwYs6j3uH6lcQ&amp;irgwc=1&amp;OCID=AID2200057_aff_7593_1243925&amp;tduid=%28ir__xfekwkhzqkkf6iy3iw0m3jzxou2xcihratwsavgs00%29%287593%29%281243925%29%28.l6kYCuH720-lk.jqXfYklwYs6j3uH6lcQ%29%28%29&amp;irclickid=_xfekwkhzqkkf6iy3iw0m3jzxou2xcihratwsavgs00&amp;xcust=2-1-1447873-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow"> Microsoft Garage Mouse without Borders</a>, but it&rsquo;s still available directly from Microsoft. We admittedly haven&rsquo;t used the app in some time, but it could do something Iogear&rsquo;s KVM switch couldn&rsquo;t &mdash; copy information from one PC to the other. (Iogear executives say that feature is coming.)</p>



<p>Logitech also offers its <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407853/logitech-mx-master-2s-review-with-flow-software.html">Flow software that connects the older MX Master hardware</a> as well as the latest <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Master-Advanced-Wireless-Mouse/dp/B07XC2FWD1?th=1&amp;xcust=2-1-1447873-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">MX Master 3 mouse</a>, though you&rsquo;ll pay $100 or so for the privilege of dedicated hardware. </p>



<p>Why buy the Iogear GCMS1922? For one, because your work PC might not allow unauthorized apps to be installed, or it might be hidden behind a VPN. Iogear&rsquo;s KVM can also mix audio from both PCs over the same headphone jack. Otherwise, however, always keep on the lookout for free solutions that can save you from shelling out for dedicated devices. </p>

## Razer’s newest soundbar tracks your head for 3D audio

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Soundbars are sort of a niche for PC gaming, as most will prefer a high-quality bookshelf set or a pair of headphones. But Razer&rsquo;s making a case for the all-in-one form factor with some surprising new tech. The Leviathan V2 Pro, announced at CES, looks like it&rsquo;s trying to be someone&rsquo;s idea of a convergence device thanks to a built-in camera flanked by infrared sensors. But, in fact, it&rsquo;s tracking the user&rsquo;s head location, the better to deliver THX-powered 3D audio. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Razer leviathan V2 pro hero image" class="wp-image-1446738" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Hero.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Razer</p></div>



<p>It&rsquo;s a novel approach, to be sure, especially since Razer&rsquo;s press info claims the Leviathan V2 Pro can convert both standard stereo audio and surround sound audio into this unique delivery system via its five forward-facing drivers. In addition to the usual Razer goodies (yes, it does have Chroma RGB), the set includes dedicated controls right up top with a handsome chamfered volume knob and a USB-C interface. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Leviathan V2 pro camera and infrared sensors" class="wp-image-1446740" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Leviathan-V2-Pro-2023_SG-6.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">razer</p></div>



<p>There&rsquo;s no HDMI &mdash; this is most definitely a <em>PC gaming </em>speaker, even though it includes a dedicated subwoofer. One concession to practicality is a 1/8&Prime; output port for your headset for those times when you&rsquo;d rather not rattle your walls with gunshot sounds. The V2 Pro is considerably bigger and beefier than the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.razer.com/gaming-speakers/razer-leviathan-v2/RZ05-03920100-R3U1&amp;xcust=2-1-1446722-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">non-pro Leviathan V2</a>, so it shouldn&rsquo;t be a surprise that it&rsquo;s also much pricier at $399.99. You&rsquo;ll be able to buy it next month. </p>

## See CyberPower’s insane ‘breathing’ Kinetic PC case with your own eyes

<p>Last year at CES, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/562598/cyberpowers-new-breathing-kinetic-pc-looks-insane.html">CyberPower&rsquo;s Kinetic Series PC</a> turned heads with a front panel full of mechanical wizardry. At first glance, the case looked as if it were breathing&mdash;its geometric vents automatically opened and closed, rippling with the same kind of futuristic sci-fi vibe you&rsquo;d find in a movie.</p>



<p>At the time, CyberPower estimated that the case would become available in fall of 2022, but that reality never materialized. Now the Kinetic 360V has appeared once again at CES 2023, with renewed promises of its coming launch. It&rsquo;s so unique and fascinating we had to see it again.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>As you&rsquo;ll see in our video from the show, this time around we get more of the practical details about how the case works&mdash;a promising sign, as it means that such everyday matters are settled. (But really, you should watch to also take another gander at how those ports open and close in response to system temps. It&rsquo;s just so neat.)</p>



<p>Plans for cost sound similar to last year&mdash;the case will run under $250. As for availability, you&rsquo;ll be able to configure a pre-built system from CyberPower with the Kinetic 360V starting in the second quarter of 2023.</p>



<p>As cool CES cases go, this one ranks right up there with the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/411607/ibuypowers-snowblind-case-will-make-your-pc-look-insane-for-a-very-low-price.html">iBuyPower Snowblind</a>. Do you <em>need</em> a case like this for good airflow? Heck no. Is it totally understandable that you would want one anyway? Heck yes. And if all goes as expected, we can all put our hands on one in just a few months. Yaaaasss.</p>

<p>The PCWorld team is live from the ground at CES 2023 in Las Vegas and they&rsquo;ve got the scoop on the latest CPUs. In the video below, executive editor Gordon Mah Ung and contributor Keith May give us the rundown on the holy trinity: AMD, Nvidia, and Intel. </p>



<p>According to Gordon, the most exciting bit of news from Intel concerns the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1435904/intel-launches-13th-gen-mobile-core-chips-with-endurance-gaming.html">13th-gen HX processors,</a> as they provide a significant bump in power from the 12th-gen iterations. The jump is from eight performance cores and eight efficiency cores to eight performance cores and a whopping 16 efficiency cores. That&rsquo;s a total of 24 cores in a laptop (!!!).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Another bit of exciting news is the announcement of the long-awaited <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444835/amd-launches-fastest-gaming-processors-with-even-more-v-cache.html">AMD Ryzen 7000 series processors with X3D</a>. The top tier processor is the Ryzen 9 7950X3D, which boasts 16 cores and up to 5.7 GHz. AMD claims that this generation of processor has a 13 percent improvement in performance in <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> and a 24 percent bump in <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>. No word yet on the pricing, but we&rsquo;ll likely get that information sooner rather than later.</p>



<p>Nvidia, meanwhile, launched the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444726/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-review.html">terribly priced GeForce RTX 4070 Ti graphics card</a>&mdash;but the introduction of new <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1445469/nvidia-unleashes-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-rtx-40-series-laptops-and-more.html">RTX 40-series gaming laptops</a> powered by the company&rsquo;s new Ada Lovelace architecture is something to get excited about.</p>

<p>One of the most appealing CPUs of last year for gamers was AMD&rsquo;s Ryzen 7 5800X3D thanks to its novel 3D V-cache technology. At CES 2023, AMD&rsquo;s back with an even more bodacious Zen 4-based follow-up: the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444835/amd-launches-fastest-gaming-processors-with-even-more-v-cache.html">Ryzen 9 7950X3D</a>. Gordon got the chance to chat with AMD&rsquo;s director of Product Management Scott Stankard to get the details about this new pixel-pushing flagship chip. </p>



<p>In fact, the 7950X3D is just one of three new chips announced with 3D V-cache and the most powerful with 16 cores. AMD also announced 12 and eight core versions for more budget builds: the Ryzen 9 7900X3D and Ryzen 7 7800X3D, respectively. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Even the least powerful of these chips is showing a 20-30% improvement over the 5800X3D in terms of raw framerates, which is pretty freakin&rsquo; great for a single-gen bump. The top-of-the-line 7950X3D is showing a considerable margin of improved performance versus Intel&rsquo;s current i9 flagship, in both games and specific productivity tasks, at least according to AMD&rsquo;s press info. </p>



<p>12 and 16 core chips aren&rsquo;t going to give absolutely incredible boosts in gaming specifically, but they&rsquo;re there for those users who want an everything machine that can handle top-tier multitasking at the same time. The extra L3 cache that makes these chips &ldquo;3D&rdquo; is placed on one of the two core chiplet dies, allowing half the cores to focus on gaming performance while the other half of the processor handles background tasks and &ldquo;bursts&rdquo; of high-clock applications. </p>

<p>Calling all gamers! If you&rsquo;re on the hunt for a gaming monitor with a ridiculously high refresh rate, you&rsquo;re in luck. Amazon&rsquo;s currently selling the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LCNJGMP&amp;xcust=2-1-1447477-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Asus ROG Swift PG259QNR gaming monitor for $299.99</a>, which is a savings of $99.01 and <em>welllllllllll </em>below the $799 this monitor debuted at when it launched in 2021. Not only does it have a 360Hz refresh rate, but it&rsquo;s also VESA wall mountable and offers a diverse selection of ports.</p>



<p>The 24.5-inch IPS ROG Swift has a refresh rate of 360Hz, a resolution of 1920&times;1080, a response time of 1ms, and an aspect ratio of 16:9. That means you can expect impossibly smooth visuals as well as a vivid picture. Our executive editor Brad Chacos <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393646/tested-how-nvidia-reflex-can-make-you-a-better-esports-gamer.html">tested this very panel</a> when it came out and said that &ldquo;the almost tactile smoothness of a 360Hz refresh rate can&rsquo;t be overstated. From games to mousing around the desktop, everything runs like butter, and Asus&rsquo;s hardware and software polish is top-notch&hellip;This thing rocks.&rdquo;</p>



<p>For connectivity options, it has one HDMI, one DC-IN, one DIsplayPort V1.4, two USB 3.0, one Nvidia Reflex Latency Analyzer-compatible USB port, and one headphone jack. Essentially, the Nvidia Reflex Latency Analyzer port measures how quickly your display refreshes after a mouse click so you can optimize your hardware setup. It&rsquo;s handy for the sorts of folks who are in the market for a 360Hz panel to begin with. The display also comes with a deck mount kit, which allows you to clamp the monitor to the edge of your desk. </p>



<p>This is a fantastic monitor for competitive gaming, and one that we highly recommend and use in real life. Ours cost hundreds more at the time however. If you&rsquo;re into competitive gaming, don&rsquo;t miss out on this killer deal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What should I buy? What&rsquo;s good?&rdquo; are the two questions our readers ask us and what we try and answer. AMD&rsquo;s new mobile processor naming scheme makes those questions nearly impossible to quickly answer and, frankly, it&rsquo;s ridiculous that consumers should be asked to even try to figure it out on their own.</p>



<p>Five separate mobile processor families. Four different processor architectures. Four different manufacturing processes. A mix of graphics technologies from the last several years. Differing I/O and memory offerings. When it takes several paragraphs just to lead readers into what AMD is announcing in the mobile Ryzen space, something has gone wrong.</p>



<p>For years, AMD, Intel, and others have signaled the &ldquo;good-better-best&rdquo; designation through the familiar numerical designations at the beginning of the product description. Most consumers understand that a Core i3 or a Ryzen 3 will underperform a Core i7 or Ryzen 7 and that Core i9 chips and Ryzen 9 processors represent the priciest, most powerful processors available. But manufacturers understand that enthusiasts want additional details, but without the need to consult something like <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1445760-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Intel&rsquo;s ARK database</a>, for example. So yes, descriptive model numbers can work.</p>



<p>In 2018 and 2019, Intel began introducing its own model numbers or processor numbers with its 10th-gen Core, Ice Lake. Intel didn&rsquo;t try to do too much. The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/397829/intel-10th-gen-ice-lake-chips-specs-features-pricing-availability.html">decoder we published in our Ice Lake intro story</a> showed that the numbers signaled the family name, processor generation, power level, and graphics level. Consumers could still instinctively figure out which technology generation was being referred to and the relative performance of the chip within Intel&rsquo;s lineup.</p>



<p>AMD? It&rsquo;s taken a well-ordered hierarchy, smashed it to bits, swept it all together, smeared glue all over the fragments, and set it upon store shelves for you to figure out. It was right to play it straight when <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1063208/amd-mobile-ryzen-naming-scheme.html">AMD first rolled its new schema in September</a>, but for me at least the verdict is in: this is crap.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img alt="AMD Ryzen 7000 Mobile Series overview" class="wp-image-1445463" height="602" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Overview-architecture.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>It&rsquo;s not that AMD offers so many different families (series) of mobile Ryzen processors, it&rsquo;s that the significant differences between them are well-hidden.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">AMD</p></div>



<p>I&rsquo;m not going to argue that AMD is being deliberately deceptive, but tell me how you&rsquo;d feel if you bought a Ryzen 7020 laptop at what you thought was a great price, only to find out that it used processor technologies that were three generations out of date. Or that the Ryzen 7045 (which isn&rsquo;t that different than a Ryzen 7020, right?) was AMD&rsquo;s very best. Would you feel any better knowing that the Ryzen 7030 uses processor technology from the beginning of 2021, a <em>six</em>-year-old graphics core, but that the Ryzen 7040 family uses AMD&rsquo;s very latest CPU technology, its very latest GPU technology, and even a special AI coprocessor as well?</p>



<p>And how would you even find that information out? AMD&rsquo;s top-of-the-line Ryzen 7045 series includes the Ryzen 7945HX, 7845HX, 7745HX, and 7645HX. There&rsquo;s not a &ldquo;Seven-zero-something-something&rdquo; chip in the entire processor family, and it&rsquo;s insane that consumers (or even journalists!) would be expected to correlate the two. </p>



<p>AMD did tell us in September that the new processor/model numbers correlate to the processor tech. The 70<strong>4</strong>0 series uses Zen <strong>4</strong> and the 70<strong>35</strong> series uses Zen 3+ (Zen <strong>3.5</strong>, get it?). But it&rsquo;s not fair to consumers to remember that, then somehow parse the differing core counts and graphics technologies as well as the other technologies. If you need a cheat sheet when buying a laptop, you&rsquo;ve failed.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s not even worth mentioning how AMD attempts to slice up its product segments by suffix, either. Nobody is going to try and understand that a U-series chip traverses the hierarchy of mainstream thin-and-light laptops, premium thin-and-lights, and whatever an &ldquo;elite ultrathin&rdquo; is&mdash;and the HS family does too, except for&hellip;See? Even chip nerds are bored already.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD Ryzen 7000 Mobile Series platform" class="wp-image-1445459" height="618" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Overview-platform.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>It&rsquo;d hard to even make heads or tails about what this slide signifies.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">AMD</p></div>



<h2 id="its-probably-too-late-to-fix">It&rsquo;s probably too late to fix</h2>



<p>What AMD began realizing several years ago is that it could win in two ways. First, delivering performance on par or better than Intel, especially when you factored in the power of its integrated GPUs. Second, by simply delivering those laptops to reviewers like PCWorld, our perception could be passed along to our readers. (There was a time when just simply reviewing a Ryzen-powered laptop was a challenge, however good those laptops might be.)</p>



<p>But AMD is <em>not</em> the dominant player in the laptop space and has never been. Laptop sales have plunged precipitously, in part because consumers bought tons of them during the pandemic. Now? They have quite enough, thank you. Intel also stole share from AMD during the third quarter, so that AMD&rsquo;s share is down around sixteen percent.</p>



<p>Adding complexity to the shopping process is not the answer for anyone. Yes, the Ryzen 3/Ryzen 5/Ryzen 7/Ryzen 9 hierarchy is still in place, but it&rsquo;s been undercut by this new nomenclature. Is a Ryzen 7 7840 HS better than a Ryzen 5 7645HX? If the average consumer&rsquo;s reaction is &ldquo;How the hell should I know?!,&rdquo; they&rsquo;ll likely move on. </p>

## LastPass hacked: How to export and protect your passwords

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>LastPass is no stranger to data breaches. It&rsquo;s suffered several high-profile leaks, with the most recent (and alarming) incident happening just last year. When news first broke in August, the developer assured everyone that customers were unaffected. But in a complete reversal, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1419901/lastpass-got-hacked-again-and-this-time-your-data-got-taken.html">the company&rsquo;s December updates were grim</a>&mdash;customer data had been taken after all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re feeling like you want to leave the service, you can hardly be blamed. In this latest breach, not only was personally identifying information like billing addresses, telephone numbers, and IP addresses stolen, but vault data as well. Most damning: Some of that vault data was unencrypted.</p>



<p>The good news is that exporting your data is quick and relatively straightforward. You get the entire vault in a single file that you can then use to upload to a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407092/best-password-managers-reviews-and-buying-advice.html">new password manager</a>.</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s how to export your passwords from LastPass&mdash;and how to do securely. Plus, what you should do afterward to ensure the safety of all your online accounts.</p>



<h2 id="how-to-export-your-lastpass-passwords">How to export your LastPass passwords</h2>



<p>Getting your passwords out of LastPass is actually very easy. More complicated is ensuring the exported file remains secure. LastPass exports in either CSV and XML file formats, and those file types aren&rsquo;t encrypted.</p>



<p>You don&rsquo;t want your passwords downloaded as plain text&mdash;even if you delete the file, it can be recoverable on an unencrypted drive. And many people haven&rsquo;t encrypted the drives on their PC.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="LastPass Exported Vault Data Sample - CSV file" class="wp-image-1445939" height="795" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/lastpassexportC.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Your exported data from LastPass will be saved to an unencrypted file. (A sample CSV document is pictured here).</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>The less complex method is to download the file to a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/device-encryption-in-windows-ad5dcf4b-dbe0-2331-228f-7925c2a3012d&amp;xcust=2-1-1445758-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">drive fully encrypted by Windows</a>, then permanently deleting it as soon as you&rsquo;re done importing your info elsewhere. (Leaving it in the Recycling Bin means the file is available and unencrypted whenever you&rsquo;re logged into your computer.) This is not a bulletproof method, as you can recover the data while logged into your PC, but it&rsquo;s a decent middle ground.</p>



<p>If you can tolerate a little more effort, I recommend <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/549444/how-to-encrypt-files-in-windows.html">creating an encrypted folder using VeraCrypt</a>, then downloading exported vault data to that location. It acts like a safe for the file. Your data only becomes available when the container is unlocked. When you&rsquo;re done, just delete the whole set while locked; if the container&rsquo;s password is never shared, the valuable info inside should remain secure.</p>



<p>Once you have your security precautions set, follow these steps to get your data out of LastPass, either via the web interface or the browser extension. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Note: </strong>If you&rsquo;re using a free account that&rsquo;s tied to mobile devices only, you should be able to export via the web. If not, a workaround is to start a paid trial, so that you temporarily get multidevice access.</p></blockquote>



<h3 id="how-to-export-from-lastpass-via-the-browser-extension">How to export from LastPass via the browser extension</h3>



<p><strong>Step 1: Access your account settings</strong></p>

<ul><li>Choose <em>Fix a problem yourself</em>.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Step 3: Export your vault items</strong></p>

<p>Your file can now be imported into a new password manager (either another cloud-based service or software installed to your computer). The process should be straightforward, but if you run into any issues, you can look up your new service&rsquo;s help pages for instructions.</p>



<h3 id="how-to-export-from-lastpass-via-the-web-interface">How to export from LastPass via the web interface</h3>

<ul><li>Log into the email address associated with your account. Open the email from LastPass and click on the <em>Continue export</em> link within. A browser tab should open, saying that the export is ready.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Step 4: Enter your login info to begin download</strong></p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="LastPass export - password input" class="wp-image-1445775" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/lastpassexport6.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<ul><li>Go back to <em>Advanced Options &gt; Export</em>. To begin the download, enter your user name and password.</li></ul>

Anyone with access to the file can see all of your passwords. For a secure way to download the file, see the notes at the start of this section.</p></blockquote>



<p>You can now import this file into a new password manager (be it another cloud-based service or a piece of software installed to your computer). It should be a straightforward process, but if you run into difficulties, your new service should have help pages with instructions.</p>



<h2 id="youre-not-done-yet-unfortunately">You&rsquo;re not done yet, unfortunately</h2>



<p>Usually, leaving a password manager for another one is simple. You export your passwords from the old service, import the info into your new service, and then go back to your life.</p>



<p>Ditching LastPass because of its breach makes matters more complicated. Because hackers have your vault data, your master password is the only thing standing between them and access to your accounts. To ensure your security, you&rsquo;re best off changing the passwords in your vault.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hopefully you had a strong random master password, which will make brute forcing entry into the vault very difficult. But there&rsquo;s no way around this one if you want to be sure you&rsquo;re safe. You can&rsquo;t change your LastPass master password and be done&mdash;the vault data captured is linked to the master password you had at the time of the hack. Updating it now won&rsquo;t help.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="5 Password-Manager f&uuml;r PC, Mac und Mobile" class="wp-image-1154237" src="https://bilder.pcwelt.de/3891448_original.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" /><figcaption>A painful truth: The only way to get out safe from LastPass is to also change all of your passwords. Yes. All of them. &#128577;</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">istockphoto.com/ManuelSousa</p></div>



<p>With hundreds of passwords a part of our daily lives, this task is no quick feat. Our recommendation? Work in graduated steps:</p>



<ol><li>Move to the new password manager</li><li>Immediately change all of the passwords for critical services&mdash;banks and other financial institutions, tax preparation, government programs, etc. Anything that could be ruinous if someone got hold of those accounts.&nbsp;</li><li>Work your way through the remainder of your passwords, starting with those that have more sensitive info stored (i.e., physical addresses, birth dates, credit card numbers). Now&rsquo;s a good time to also wipe that info from websites; keep it in your password manager instead.</li></ol>



<p>You want to do this <em>after</em> you leave LastPass, especially if you&rsquo;re concerned about remaining security vulnerabilities the company has yet to detect. This breach is not LastPass&rsquo;s first&mdash;and given the company&rsquo;s history, likely not its last, either.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(Whether LastPass is that much better at transparency, has that much more difficulty maintaining security, or is just a bigger target in general is a question to be answered another time.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whatever you do, don&rsquo;t abandon password managers all together. Security online is imperfect, and so the solutions for it are also imperfect&mdash;but some systems are much more flawed than others. Reusing passwords, using weaker passwords, writing them down in a notebook&mdash;these won&rsquo;t keep you safe. You can find a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407092/best-password-managers-reviews-and-buying-advice.html">good password manager</a> (and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/709052/6-common-reasons-people-dont-use-a-password-manager-and-why-theyre-wrong.html">a system of use</a>) that works for you.</p>

<p>CES 2023 is a very, very good year for PC monitors. Both OLED and Mini-LED&mdash;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/560224/oled-vs-mini-led-the-pc-displays-of-the-future-compared.html">the displays of the future</a>&mdash;are just on the cusp of mainstream adoption and, as a result, every monitor maker has launched a salvo of both mid-range and premium options that use these new display technologies. In fact, I&rsquo;d argue the monitor space is now even more exciting than televisions.</p>



<p>From super-ultrawide form factors to folding panels, the monitors of CES 2023 are a wild bunch. Here are the 10 most eye-catching displays we encountered.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Further reading:</strong> <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1445432/youre-going-to-need-a-bigger-backpack-laptops-are-large-and-in-charge-at-ces-2023.html">Powerful laptops are large and in charge at CES 2023</a></p></blockquote>



<h2 id="lg-ultragear-27gr95qe-b">LG Ultragear 27GR95QE-B</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="lg-ultragear-27-oled" class="wp-image-1446873" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/lg-ultragear-27-oled.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith/IDG</p></div>



<p>The <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-27gr95qe-b&amp;xcust=2-1-1446853-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">LG Ultragear 27GR95QE-B</a> was technically released prior to CES 2023, yet it&rsquo;s clearly the most important monitor at the show. Why? Because it&rsquo;s the debut monitor for LG&rsquo;s new 27-inch, 1440p, 240Hz OLED panel.</p>



<p>This panel, also found in several other monitors on this list, will have incredibly wide appeal. 1440p resolution is high enough to look sharp, yet won&rsquo;t <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/416006/the-best-graphics-cards-for-pc-gaming.html">melt your GPU</a> the moment you dare to launch <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. The panel&rsquo;s refresh rate is ideal for gaming and feels ultra-responsive on the windows desktop.</p>



<p>But the most important spec? The price. At $999.99, the LG Ultragear 27GR95QE-B isn&rsquo;t exactly affordable&hellip;but it&rsquo;s much closer than OLED monitors of the past. This is an OLED monitor you can buy without feeling ashamed to admit how much you spent on it. Probably.</p>



<h2 id="acer-predator-x27u">Acer Predator X27U</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="acer-predator-x27u" class="wp-image-1446871" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/acer-predator-x27u.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith/IDG</p></div>



<p>Acer&rsquo;s entry into the mainstream OLED arena is the Predator X27U. It&rsquo;s a 27-inch, 1440, 240Hz OLED monitor that uses the same panel found in the LG Ultragear 27GR95QE-B and, as a result, looks equally gorgeous. The Predator X27U also quotes a maximum peak brightness of 1000 nits and a color gamut covering 98.5 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut.</p>



<p>This monitor even delivers a feature far too rare among gaming displays: <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/612470/you-should-buy-a-usb-c-hub-monitor-heres-what-you-need-to-know.html">USB-C</a>. It has one USB-C port with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and up to 90 watts of Power Delivery. This adds versatility and is particularly important for content creators and professionals considering the Predator X27U as a budget alternative to pricey &ldquo;pro&rdquo; OLED monitors.</p>



<p>The Acer Predator X27U will hit retailers in Q2 of 2023 at $1,099.99.</p>



<h2 id="asus-rog-swift-pg27aqdm">Asus ROG Swift PG27AQDM</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="ROG Swift OLED PG27AQDM_L" class="wp-image-1446869" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ROG-Swift-OLED-PG27AQDM_L.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Asus</p></div>



<p>Asus&rsquo; is often among the quickest to jump on new monitor technology, and CES 2023 is no exception. The ROG Swift PG27AQDM is one of several monitors to pack LG&rsquo;s hot new 27-inch, 1440p OLED panel. It promises incredible contrast, a peak brightness of 1000 nits, and a color gamut that spans 99 precent of DCI-P3. There&rsquo;s also support for enhanced refresh rates of up to 240Hz.</p>



<p>But it&rsquo;s the design, not the display panel, that sets the ROG Swift PG27AQDM apart from competitors. Its aggressive styling and top-notch build quality promises a premium experience worthy of the monitor&rsquo;s premium price. Asus also makes vague claims that its &ldquo;custom heatsink&rdquo; will offer superior thermal performance. I&rsquo;ll be eager to see if that translates to an improvement in image quality.</p>



<p>Speaking of which&mdash;Asus hasn&rsquo;t revealed a price tag for the PG27AQDM yet. Given that LG&rsquo;s OLED monitor retails at $999.99, however, it&rsquo;s likely to land above $1,000.</p>



<h2 id="asus-rog-swift-pro-pg248qp">Asus ROG Swift Pro PG248QP</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Swift Pro pg248qp" class="wp-image-1446865" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ROG-Swift-Pro-PG248QP_-Adjustable-stand.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Asus</p></div>



<p>While most premium monitors are just now upgrading to 240Hz, Asus&rsquo; esports-oriented ROG Swift Pro PG248QP&rsquo;s 24-inch 1080p IPS screen can <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1446541/face-melting-500hz-monitors-are-a-thing-now-my-body-is-ready.html">hit a blistering 540Hz</a>. This incredible speed puts a new frame on-screen everyone 1.85 milliseconds. Provided you&rsquo;re playing a game capable of hitting 540 frames per second, of course. The monitor also supports Nvidia G-Sync and Nvidia Reflex Analyzer to ensure smooth frame pacing and the lowest possible latency.</p>

<p>The ROG Swift Pro PG248QP also surprises with an adjustable stand that has two retractable &ldquo;claws.&rdquo; They can be retracted to take up less space on your desk. Asus&rsquo; says this feature targets esports players who like to play as close to the monitor as possible, but it could be useful for anyone with a small desk.</p>



<p>Competitive PC gamers can expect to see this monitor arrive in Q2 2023. Asus hasn&rsquo;t announced pricing.</p>



<h2 id="lg-oled-flex">LG OLED Flex</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="lg-oled-flex" class="wp-image-1446868" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/lg-oled-flex.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith/IDG</p></div>



<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/916686/corsairs-new-oled-monitor-transforms-from-flat-to-curved.html">Corsair&rsquo;s 45-inch flexible Xeneon Flex</a> offers the best of flat and curved-screen displays, but it has a downside: you have to flex it yourself. Manually. Like, with your muscles. LG&rsquo;s OLED Flex takes a different approach, using a built-in motor to do the flexing for you. The monitor can shift from curved to flat, or some position in-between, with a touch of the bundled remote.</p>



<p>The LG OLED Flex isn&rsquo;t an ultrawide monitor, which makes it less immersive than <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1439692/best-ultrawide-gaming-monitors.html">those stretched-screen alternatives</a>, but it does offer 4K resolution and a refresh rate of 120Hz. It also has several special restricted display space modes that emulate a 32- or 27-inch screen, adding versatility for situations where the large display size isn&rsquo;t desired. Personally, I find first-person shooters a bit stomach-churning on big screens, so I&rsquo;d probably use these modes for <em>Halo </em>and <em>Overwatch.</em></p>



<p>Pricing and availability for the United States hasn&rsquo;t been revealed.</p>



<h2 id="lenovo-thinkvision-p27-pz30-and-p32-pz30">Lenovo ThinkVision P27-pz30 and P32-pz30</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="lenovo-thinkvision-32-pz30" class="wp-image-1446864" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/lenovo-thinkvision-32-pz30.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Lenovo</p></div>



<p>Lenovo&rsquo;s business-like ThinkVision monitors are often unexciting, but the ThinkVision P27-pz30 and P32-pz30 are an obvious exceptions. These 4K IPS monitors pack a Mini-LED backlight with 1,152 dimming zones. This is top-shelf for modern Mini-LED monitors (aside from Samsung&rsquo;s Odyssey line), providing excellent contrast and extreme bright highlights in HDR content. Both monitors are VESA DisplayHDR 1000 certified and claim a maximum peak brightness of 1,200 nits.</p>



<p>These monitors also support USB-C connections and provide up to 140 watts of power of USB-C power delivery, which is enough to handle most laptops that support USB-C charging and adds a bit of futureproofing (most current laptops don&rsquo;t support USB-C charging over 100 watts, but it&rsquo;s likely to become popular over the next few years).</p>



<p>Lenovo says the 32-inch model will be priced at $1,599 (the 27-inch model&rsquo;s MSRP hasn&rsquo;t been announced). That&rsquo;s a big price drop over prior Mini-LED monitors with 1,152 dimming zones. The only catch? It won&rsquo;t be available until August.</p>



<h2 id="samsung-odyssey-oled-g9-49-inch">Samsung Odyssey OLED G9 49-inch</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Samsung Odyssey G9 OLED" class="wp-image-1446867" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/samsung-odyssey-oled-g9.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith/IDG</p></div>



<p>Samsung&rsquo;s flagship 49-inch super-ultrawide returns to CES 2023 with a big new upgrade: a QD-OLED panel. The new Odyssey OLED G9 promises all of the perks of other OLED monitors including a nearly infinite contrast ratio, a refresh rate up to 240Hz, low pixel response times, and a broad color gamut. The prior Odyssey Neo G9, which had a Mini-LED backlight, was already a stunner, so it&rsquo;ll be interesting to see how the new OLED model compares.</p>



<p>The Odyssey OLED G9 also adds Samsung&rsquo;s Smart Hub features including support for streaming apps, such as Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Hulu, plus Samsung Gaming Hub, which supports <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/810011/xbox-cloud-gaming-review.html">Xbox Cloud Gaming</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/630335/geforce-now-review.html">Nvidia GeForce Now</a>. Conveniently, Nvidia will soon add <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1445469/nvidia-unleashes-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-rtx-40-series-laptops-and-more.html">support for ultrawide screens to GeForce Now</a>: not enough to make the most of the Odyssey OLED G9&rsquo;s super-ultrawide format, but a step in the right direction.</p>



<p>Pricing and availability remain under wraps, unfortunately.</p>



<h2 id="samsung-odyssey-neo-g9-g95nc">Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 (G95NC)</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="CES 2023 monitors hero " class="wp-image-1446870" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/samsung-odyssey-neo-g9.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith/IDG</p></div>



<p>Does a 49-inch super-ultrawide still feel a bit small? Well, Samsung has just the thing for you: the new <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1445207/samsungs-biggest-ultrawide-monitor-yet-will-bust-your-back-and-your-wallet.html">Odyssey Neo G9, a 57-inch monster</a> that measures four and a half feet in width. It&rsquo;s big, it&rsquo;s curved, and it&rsquo;s the last word in monitor immersion.</p>



<p>Size aside, 2023&rsquo;s Odyssey Neo G9 also impresses with its &ldquo;dual 4K&rdquo; resolution of 7,620 x 2,160. It has a Mini-LED backlight and is VESA DisplayHDR 1000 certified, meaning it can hit a maximum brightness of up to 1,000 nits. Despite its resolution, the monitor will still provide a maximum refresh rate of 240Hz. The monitor&rsquo;s extreme resolution and refresh rate requires a ton of video bandwidth, so it includes support for the latest DisplayPort 2.1 standard.</p>



<p>Once again, pricing and availability remains to be seen&mdash;but it&rsquo;s sure to be very, very expensive.</p>



<h2 id="acer-predator-x45">Acer Predator X45</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1441401/acers-curvy-predator-x45-is-the-ultrawide-oled-to-beat.html">Acer Predator X45</a> is the company&rsquo;s take on LG&rsquo;s new 45-inch OLED panel, which is also found in the Corsair Xeneon Flex and LG Ultragear 45GR95QE-B. Indeed, the Predator and Ultragear monitors are extremely similar. Aside from sharing the same LG OLED Panel, with 3,440 x 1,440 resolution and 240Hz maximum refresh, they also have an identical (and aggressive) 800R curvature. These are big, beautiful displays only a few inches smaller than Samsung&rsquo;s Odyssey OLED G9.</p>



<p>For me, though, the Predator X45 has one little extra that sets it apart. USB-C. The Predator X45, like the Predator X27U, has a USB-C port with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and up to 90 watts of USB Power Delivery. This offers added versatility and the chance for a one-port connection with modern laptops.</p>



<p>The Acer Predator X45 will arrive in Q2 of 2023 at $1,699.</p>



<h2 id="msi-meg-342">MSI MEG 342</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="msi-meg-342" class="wp-image-1446863" height="516" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/msi-meg-342.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="800" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">MSI</p></div>



<p>The MSI MEG 342 is an alternative take on the popular <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/624305/alienware-aw3423dw-review-quantum-dot-oled-makes-rival-monitors-feel-obsolete.html">Alienware AW3423DW ultrawide</a> that dominates <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/813301/best-gaming-monitors.html">PC World&rsquo;s list of the best gaming monitors</a>. It&rsquo;s a 34-inch ultrawide with a QD-OLED panel, 3,440 x 1,440 resolution, and a refresh rate of up to 175Hz. While I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to view this one first-hand, I expect MSI&rsquo;s version will deliver image quality to rival Alienware&rsquo;s top-notch ultrawide.</p>



<p>Of course, you might be wondering: Why buy the MSI instead? In truth, they are very similar, and the winner may often come down to whichever ends up on sale at the lowest price. Still, MSI does throw in an RGB light sync feature called Glow Sync. The Alienware also include RGB lighting, but it&rsquo;s more subdued.</p>



<p>The MSI MEG 342&rsquo;s pricing and availability remain unannounced.</p>

## Lenovo’s new color e-ink laptop might be worth buying

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>There have been <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398551/lenovos-thinkbook-plus-adds-a-secondary-e-ink-display-to-keep-you-focused.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">a few attempts</a> to combine a conventional laptop form factor with easy-on-the-eyes (literally!) e-ink technology more commonly seen in Kindles and other e-readers. But Lenovo may have finally cracked it with its latest attempt, the ThinkBook Plus Twist. That mouthful of a name hides a design that combines old and new elements for something that&rsquo;s striking&hellip;and perhaps even practical. </p>



<p>The Twist uses a 2-in-1 form factor with a screen that rotates on a central 180-degree hinge, a design that&rsquo;s fallen out of favor since Lenovo&rsquo;s own Yoga designs became dominant. But spinning around the screen lets the user choose between the primary display&mdash;a 13.3-inch, 2.8K OLED touch panel that&rsquo;s no slouch on its own&mdash;and the 12-inch e-ink panel on the rear. Not only is this front-lit display far less taxing to view, it&rsquo;s in full color, still something of a novelty for e-ink panels of any size. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Thinkbook plus twist with stylus" class="wp-image-1444652" height="768" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/06_ThinkBook_Twist_Gen_4_Hero_Tablet_Mode.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Lenovo</p></div>



<p>Lenovo is quick to point out the advantages of using the e-ink panel: longer stretches of working with less eye strain, and allegedly, a considerable power savings on the laptop&rsquo;s battery. Thanks to the rotating hinge, either the main OLED or the e-ink panel can be used in conventional laptop mode or in reverse, for easy access via the included stylus. (Which, yes, allows for drawing and taking notes on the e-ink side, too.) </p>



<p>More traditional charms of the ThinkBook Twist include 13th-gen Intel processors, maximum 16GB DDR5 memory, 1TB of 4th-gen SSD storage, and Wi-Fi 6E. We&rsquo;ve yet to get our hands on the design, so it remains to be seen how practical a color e-ink display is for full work or browsing. We&rsquo;ll have to wait until June to find out, when the ThinkBook Twist will launch for $1,649.</p>

## The YogaBook 9i packs a radical dual-screen design
 - [https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444656/the-yogabook-9i-packs-a-radical-dual-screen-design.html](https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444656/the-yogabook-9i-packs-a-radical-dual-screen-design.html)

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Lenovo&rsquo;s new YogaBook 9i isn&rsquo;t the first time we&rsquo;ve seen someone try to cram two screens into a laptop, with the second where the keyboard usually sits. But it might be the most earnest yet, and the most likely to actually succeed as a niche form factor. Chalk it up to the brand positioning&mdash;right at the top of Lenovo&rsquo;s most stylish consumer line&mdash;and a considerate design that allows the laptop to perform to its strengths. </p>



<p>The most eye-catching and radical feature of the YogaBook 9i is its ability to stand on its own as a dual-screen setup, with <em>both </em>13-inch OLED screens visible in landscape mode, the detachable keyboard sitting beneath it, and an origami-style stand propping it up. The sight is a bit bizarre, but anyone who&rsquo;s grown reliant on a dual-monitor workstation will instantly see the advantage. While this isn&rsquo;t likely to be a popular choice for, say, working on a cross-country flight, it means you can leave the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1363856/this-cute-lil-monitor-attaches-to-the-top-of-your-laptops-screen.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">portable USB monitor</a> behind for dual-screen productivity in your hotel room. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Yogabook 9i with keyboard" class="wp-image-1444664" height="1200" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/05_Yogabook_9i_Hero_AIO_A-2048x2048-1.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Lenovo</p></div>



<p>Similar to the folding screen on the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394141/the-ultra-mobile-lenovo-thinkpad-x1-fold-changed-how-i-work-from-home.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">ThinkPad X1 Fold</a>, the laptop&rsquo;s keyboard can rest on the bottom screen, with the remainder of the panel devoted to either touchpad or widget display. You can also use it in any of the normal 2-in-1 configurations, presenting a slideshow or video on the opposite screen, or with both screens vertical and side-by-side, either held like a book or propped up on the included stand. There are a lot of options, all supported by an included stylus and a series of multi-finger gestures for managing the screens and windows. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Yogabook 9i with in standard laptop mode" class="wp-image-1444667" height="855" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/08_Yogabook_9i_Hero_Front_Facing_Lef-2048x2048-1.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Lenovo</p></div>



<p>Underneath the appealing &ldquo;Tidal Teal&rdquo; colorway (reminds me of my old Game Boy Color!), the laptop offers an Intel Core i7-U15 processor with integrated Iris X graphics, 16GB of memory, and either 512GB or 1TB of SSD Gen-4 storage. Lenovo&rsquo;s usual camera setup, with an IR sensor for Windows Hello and a shutter for privacy, are included. Lenovo claims up to 10 hours of video playback on both screens with the brightness at 150 nits, or 14 hours if you use just one screen, with a more typical 7 hours of life in a standard workload. Ports are triple USB type-C, with no variation. </p>



<p>The YogaBook 9i (or Yoga Book 9i, Lenovo uses both names in its press materials) will launch in June, starting at a hefty $2,099. That&rsquo;s pricey, even for a top-of-the-line Yoga, but its double OLED screens do give it added value. </p>

## AMD unleashes Ryzen 7000 laptop CPUs with drastically different architectures

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>AMD launched its Ryzen 7000 family of mobile processors at CES 2023 with a family spread across four different processor architectures&mdash;and with a new AI effort, Radeon XDNA, ushering in a future driven by artificial intelligence.</p>



<p>Recall last September when <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1063208/amd-mobile-ryzen-naming-scheme.html">AMD introduced its new processor naming scheme</a>. Now, that formula is more important than ever to decode the five Ryzen 7000 Mobile series&mdash;the Ryzen 7045, Ryzen 7040, Ryzen 7035, Ryzen 7030, and Ryzen 7020&mdash;and the Zen 4, Zen 3+, Zen 3, and Zen 2 processor architectures spread between them. AMD also refers to them by their platform, too: the U-series chips for thin-and-light notebooks between 15 and 28 watts, the Ryzen HS series for 35W to 45W thin enthusiast notebooks, and the Ryzen HX series for 55W ultra enthusiast notebooks.</p>



<p>AMD&rsquo;s new mobile offerings are headlined by &ldquo;Dragon Range,&rdquo; the &ldquo;extreme laptop gaming CPU&rdquo; that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/697301/amd-announces-2023-extreme-gaming-laptop-cpu-dragon-range.html">AMD actually pre-announced last year</a>. &ldquo;Our mission statement last year was we want to lead with thinner, lighter, more power efficient, more performant laptop designs,&rdquo; Don Woligroski, an AMD&nbsp;senior product manager, said in a briefing with reporters. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s still true. The real big change this year is we&rsquo;re also focusing on new technologies to kind of really change the user experience.&rdquo;</p>



<p>AMD is continuing to bet big on performance and battery life as its selling points. Though AMD&rsquo;s share of the mobile PC processor market fell to about 16 percent during the third quarter of 2022, AMD&rsquo;s eager to regain lost ground. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1435904/intel-launches-13th-gen-mobile-core-chips-with-endurance-gaming.html">Intel has launched its own 13th-gen mobile Core chips at CES, </a>including AI technologies as well. Here&rsquo;s what each of AMD&rsquo;s product families has to offer&mdash;and how you&rsquo;ll know if you&rsquo;re actually buying AMD&rsquo;s latest and greatest.</p>

<p>In a recorded briefing for reporters, AMD published a summary of the new Ryzen 7000 series of mobile processors. Only the top two tiers&mdash;the Ryzen 7045 and the Ryzen 7040 series&mdash;use AMD&rsquo;s latest Zen 4 processor architectures. The others are based on combinations of the mobile Zen 3+ architecture, (<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/562347/amd-ryzen-6000-brings-6nm-rdna-2-and-zen-3-to-laptops.html">launched this past January</a>), the mobile Zen 3 (<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393920/amd-launches-ryzen-5000-mobile-processors-for-laptop-gaming-and-productivity.html">launched two years ago</a> in January 2021), and the Zen 2 architecture, part of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398840/ryzen-4000-cpus-amd-zen-2-laptops.html">2020 Ryzen 4000 mobile Ryzen lineup</a>. AMD is using different process technologies for each of these families, as well.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD Ryzen 7000 Mobile Series overview" class="wp-image-1445463" height="602" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Overview-architecture.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">AMD</p></div>



<p>Those numerical processor designations will form the foundation of the new chips. Just keep in mind that the generic &ldquo;series&rdquo; descriptions aren&rsquo;t actually product names: the Ryzen 7040 series includes the Ryzen 9 7940HS, the Ryzen 7 7840HS, and the Ryzen 5 7640HS, which aren&rsquo;t implied by the &ldquo;7040&rdquo; name at all, really.</p>



<p>But if you&rsquo;re buying a laptop, you&rsquo;ll also see a few letters tacked on at the end of the processor&rsquo;s name. One of these suffixes, &ldquo;U,&rdquo; should be familiar to laptop buyers, as that typically signals the lowest end of the lineup. Intel uses &ldquo;U&rdquo; to denote a tablet processor, and both companies have begun using &ldquo;H&rdquo; to indicate a higher-end chip. That&rsquo;s the case, here, too: HS chips indicate &ldquo;elite ultrathin&rdquo; notebooks, while the &ldquo;HX&rdquo; suffix is reserved for the best of the best: the &ldquo;extreme&rdquo; gaming and creator notebooks.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD Ryzen 7000 Mobile Series platform" class="wp-image-1445459" height="618" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Overview-platform.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">AMD</p></div>



<p>AMD is still using its Ryzen 3, Ryzen 5, Ryzen 7, and Ryzen 9 designations, too, to let you know the good-better-best-<em>really</em> best hierarchy. Is it all overkill? Probably, but at least AMD is making an effort to try and tell you what to buy. Just make sure you have an article like this handy when you go shopping.</p>



<h2 id="amd-ryzen-7045-mobile-series-premium-power">AMD Ryzen 7045 Mobile series: Premium power</h2>



<p>AMD&rsquo;s new &ldquo;Dragon Range&rdquo; processor is its best and brightest, featuring almost all of its latest technologies. Though AMD didn&rsquo;t call it out as such, the chip family seems designed for an external CPU, leaning heavily on a high-end core count (16 cores, 32 threads) and just a pair of last-gen RDNA2 graphics units instead. Though AMD is separately announcing its latest desktop Ryzen chips with performance-enhancing V-Cache, the 7045 chips include a relatively massive 80MB of cache memory, far more than the other mobile series.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img alt="AMD Ryzen 7045 Mobile Series " class="wp-image-1445462" height="599" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Ryzen-7045-series-overview.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>AMD&rsquo;s flagship 7045 series of mobile Ryzen chips is aimed at the extreme content and productivity segment.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">AMD</p></div>



<p>The 7045 series includes four chips, which will begin shipping inside laptops in February. AMD announced that four laptops (the Alienware m16 and m18, the Asus Strix, and the Lenovo Legion) will include the 7945HX.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Ryzen 9 7945HX</strong> (pictured at top): 16 cores/32 threads, 2.5GHz base clock/5.4GHz turbo; 80MB cache; 55-75W+ TDP</li><li><strong>Ryzen 9 7845HX:</strong> 12 cores/24 threads, 3.0GHz base clock/5.2GHz turbo; 76MB cache; 45-75W TDP</li><li><strong>Ryzen 7 7745HX:</strong> 8 cores/16 threads, 3.6GHz base clock/5.1GHz turbo; 40MB cache; 45-75W TDP</li><li><strong>Ryzen 5 7645HX:</strong> 8 cores/12 threads, 4.0GHz base clock/5.0GHz turbo; 38MB cache; 45-75W TDP</li></ul>



<p>From a performance standpoint, AMD is promising an 18 percent performance improvement on the Cinebench benchmark using its single-thread test, versus the last-generation <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amd.com/en/products/apu/amd-ryzen-9-6900hx&amp;xcust=2-1-1444850-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Ryzen 6900HX</a> (8 cores, 16 threads, 4.9GHz turbo clock), and a 78 percent increase on the option to use all of the available threads. AMD is also promising a hefty performance increase over Intel&rsquo;s 12th-gen mobile Core chips. (Though Intel just announced its 13th-gen mobile Core chips, they weren&rsquo;t available for testing.)</p>

<h2 id="amd-ryzen-7040-mobile-series-meet-the-new-xdna-ryzen-ai-engine">AMD Ryzen 7040 Mobile series: Meet the new XDNA Ryzen AI engine</h2>



<p>AMD&rsquo;s Ryzen 7040 Mobile series of processors is noteworthy for two things: AMD&rsquo;s other new mobile Ryzen family to offer the Zen 4 architecture, and the debut platform for XDNA, AMD&rsquo;s new Ryzen AI engine architecture. If you&rsquo;re in the market for the latest in AMD Ryzen technology, the 7040 series may be your best bet: It offers Zen 4, the leading-edge 4nm process, DDR5/LPDDR5 support, USB4, and a hefty dozen RDNA3 GPU cores integrated within it.</p>



<p>The three chips within the family are all designed for &ldquo;elite ultrathin&rdquo; laptops, and carry the HS designation. Laptops using these new chips will begin shipping in March.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Ryzen 9 7940HS:</strong> 8 cores/16 threads, 4.0GHz base clock/5.2GHz turbo; 40MB cache; 35-45W TDP</li><li><strong>Ryzen 7 7840HS:</strong> 8 cores/16 threads, 3.8GHz base clock/5.1GHz turbo; 40MB cache; 35-45W TDP</li><li><strong>Ryzen 5 7640HS:</strong> 6 cores/12 threads, 4.3GHz base clock/5.0GHz turbo; 38MB cache; 35-45W TDP</li></ul>



<p>AMD chose to compare its new 7040 series chips to the Intel Core i7-1280P, as well as the Apple M1 Pro, in terms of content creation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-jetpack-image-compare"><div class="juxtapose"><img alt="AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS mobile productivity" class="image-compare__image-before" height="1159" id="1445560" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Ryzen-7840HS-productivity.png" width="2239" /><img alt="AMD Ryzen 9 7940HS mobile productivity" class="image-compare__image-after" height="1162" id="1445561" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Ryzen-7940HS-productivity.png" width="2179" /></div></figure>



<p>The most interesting new addition to the 7040 series is XDNA, which, for now, will be the only AMD Ryzen processor to feature the new XDNA architecture. AMD sees XDNA in the same light as RDNA: decades ago, the CPU performed sound and graphics calculations. Over time, those functions migrated to discrete logic blocks, with graphics eventually partitioned off into the GPUs and graphics cards we see today. AMD sees AI evolving somewhat in the same vein, as a function that can be offloaded to a dedicated engine.</p>



<p>According to Nick Ni, senior director for AI and the computing markets for AMD, AMD already attacks AI at the enterprise and server space with cards like the AMD Alveo V70, which provides AI functionality that can use connected cameras to recognize the potential for auto accidents or anticipate hospital patients falling when impaired. Closer to home, AI is used in both smartphone cameras for portrait mode, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1346280/microsofts-new-surface-pro-9-hides-an-arm-option-and-cool-features.html">Windows Studio Effects for Windows on Arm PCs</a>, and, potentially, AI art, though <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/916785/creating-ai-art-local-pc-stable-diffusion.html">those functions currently run on the GPU</a>. Like other AMD GPUs, XDNA is just a scaled-down version of the AI inferencing technology found in the V70.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD XDNA Ryzen AI" class="wp-image-1445565" height="633" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/AMD-Ryzen-AI.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>AMD&rsquo;s Ryzen AI will be built into the Ryzen 7040 Series.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">AMD</p></div>



<p>AMD is remaining somewhat vague about the advantages of AI in current PCs. However, AMD Ryzen AI, which runs on top of the XDNA architecture, can run up to four concurrent AI streams at once, and is 50 percent more responsive than the AI engine built into the Apple M2. The multi-stream AI engine should deliver 35 percent more responsiveness than a single AI engine, AMD said.</p>



<p>Executives said that the XDNA architecture that makes up Ryzen AI is actually an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array), logic that was acquired as part of AMD&rsquo;s $35 billion acquisition of Xilinx in 2020. Though analysts told PCWorld that they believe the FPGA is actually fixed-function, the advantage of an FPGA is that it can be reconfigured after it&rsquo;s been shipped.</p>



<p>&ldquo;In a market that is inevitably going to drive toward AI solutions, you can see the potential for <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1424575/chatgpt-is-the-future-of-ai-chatbots.html">ChatGPT</a> and Dall-E, and those are just two things that can change how AI can be leveraged,&rdquo; said Don Woligroski, an AMD&nbsp;senior product manager, in a briefing with reporters. &ldquo;And make no mistake, AMD sees that. This is a very early time in the game, and this is only going to get more pervasive.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Is AI important for your next PC? Not now, probably. But eventually? It seems likely.</p>



<h2 id="ryzen-7035-7030-and-7020-mobile-series-mainstream-ryzen-laptops">Ryzen 7035, 7030, and 7020 Mobile series: Mainstream Ryzen laptops</h2>



<p>AMD&rsquo;s Ryzen 7035 Mobile series will be aimed at mainstream laptops, where AMD has historically somewhat struggled. Technically, these chips will ship into &ldquo;premium thin and light&rdquo; laptops, and you&rsquo;ll see a decent mix of AMD&rsquo;s latest technologies here: the Zen3+ architecture on a 6nm process, with DDR5/LPDDR5, 12 older RDNA2 GPU cores, and USB4 technology. </p>



<p>&ldquo;AMD owns battery life and Windows x86 laptops,&rdquo; Woligrowski said as he introduced the new processors. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anybody would argue against that right now. We have the best, the best longevity and true mobile solutions.&rdquo;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD Ryzen 7035 Mobile gaming benchmarks" class="wp-image-1445595" height="580" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Ryzen-7035-mobile-gaming.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>AMD&rsquo;s betting on the integrated graphics inside the Ryzen 7 7735U and other members of the Ryzen 7030 Mobile series handily trouncing Intel&rsquo;s older chips.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">AMD</p></div>



<p>However, AMD isn&rsquo;t disclosing the actual members of the 7035 Mobile series, besides the fact that the Ryzen 7 7735U exists. We know that the family will offer up to 8 cores and 16 threads, with &ldquo;battery life the competition can only dream of,&rdquo; according to the company&mdash;but without too many specifics. AMD is claiming that the 7035 series will offer 15 percent longer video playback than the 12th-gen Intel mobile Core i7.</p>



<p>The Ryzen 7030 series will launch inside of mainstream thin-and-light laptops. AMD isn&rsquo;t disclosing anything about this family, either, save for one entry&mdash;the Ryzen 7 7730U&mdash;and the fact that it will use the Zen 3 architecture on a 7nm process, with eight &ldquo;Vega&rdquo; integrated graphics cores. (Yes, Vega, which <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/411470/radeon-vega-revealed-5-things-you-need-to-know-about-amds-cutting-edge-graphics-cards.html">debuted about six years ago in 2017</a>.)</p>



<p>Still, AMD is positioning the Ryzen 7 7730U as one that will clearly outperform the 12th-gen Core i7-1265U, as shown in AMD&rsquo;s own benchmark estimates, below. AMD is also announcing that the company will ship an AMD Ryzen Pro version of the 7030, as well.</p>

## AMD’s V-Cache-infused Ryzen 7000 X3D chips claim gaming supremacy

<p>AMD is launching the Ryzen 7 7800X3D desktop processor at CES 2023 with V-Cache as the world&rsquo;s fastest gaming processor&mdash;and it&rsquo;s not even the fastest processor in its new family of chips.</p>



<p>In February, AMD will begin shipments of the Ryzen 9 7950X3D, the very similar Ryzen 9 7900X3D and the Ryzen 7 7800X3D, pairing a fast processor core with gobs of performance-enhancing cache. Following the launch of the $449 (and now significantly discounted) <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/701130/tested-the-ryzen-7-5800x3ds-astonishing-performance-shows-how-far-amds-ryzen-has-come.html">Ryzen 7 5800X3D</a> in June, the new processors move the X3D lineup into what should be the AM5 socket architecture, increasing power from 105W to 120W as a consequence.</p>



<p>But the increased power consumption accompanies massive improvements across the board.  Yes, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D includes eight cores and 16 threads, the same as the older Ryzen 7 5800X3D. But boost clocks shoot up to 5.0GHz, a 500MHz increase. And look out for not one but two Ryzen 9 processors: the Ryzen 9 7950X3D includes 16 cores, 32 threads, and a boost speed of 5.7GHz, which simply blows the prior generation out of the water.</p>



<p>The selling point of the X3D product line, however, is the inclusion of V-Cache. By bundling a massive amount of level-3 cache within the SOC package, AMD&rsquo;s processors can avoid having to search for key data in the relatively slower main memory. The top-end Ryzen 9 7950X3D includes 144MB of cache, a cool 50 percent more than the Ryzen 7 5800X3D, though it will only be available on a single chiplet that an app or game can remain pinned to if it needs the extra cache. </p>



<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t need to boost that high in order to get that game performance because there&rsquo;s so much memory on the chip,&rdquo; said Don Woligroski, an AMD&nbsp;senior product manager, in a briefing with reporters. The chips aren&rsquo;t overclockable, either.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD Ryzen 7xxx with V-Cache" class="wp-image-1444845" height="617" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Primary-chip-shot-maybe.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>A summary of AMD&rsquo;s new Ryzen chips with V-Cache.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">AMD</p></div>



<p>Below you&rsquo;ll find a summary of AMD&rsquo;s three new X3D Ryzens. However, AMD hasn&rsquo;t formally released the base clock of the Ryzen 7 7800X3D quite yet.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Ryzen 9 7950X3D:</strong> 16 cores/32 threads; 4.2GHz base clock/5.7GHz turbo; 144MB of cache</li><li><strong>Ryzen 9 7900X3D:</strong> 12 cores/24 threads; 4.4GHz base clock/5.6GHz turbo; 140MB of cache</li><li><strong>Ryzen 7 7800X3D:</strong> 8 cores/16 threads; 4.x GHz base clock/5.0GHz turbo; 104MB of cache</li></ul>



<p>AMD is positioning their new chips as ideal for both gaming as well as content creation, but <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/633599/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-amds-new-ryzen-7-5800x3d-processor.html">as we pointed out earlier</a>, the additional cache doesn&rsquo;t quite make as much difference in non-gaming applications. Woligroski noted, however, that you&rsquo;ll see a significant improvement in gaming where the games are CPU-limited, including popular e-sports games such as <em>League of Legends.</em></p>



<p>We&rsquo;ve included the performance data AMD provided below:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-jetpack-image-compare"><div class="juxtapose"><img alt="AMD Ryzen 7xxx with V-Cache" class="image-compare__image-before" height="1276" id="1444842" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/7800X3D-gaming-perf.png" width="2260" /><img alt="AMD Ryzen 7xxx with V-Cache" class="image-compare__image-after" height="1231" id="1444844" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/7950X3D-gaming-perf.png" width="2215" /></div><figcaption>Estimated gaming performance for the AMD Ryzen 7800X3D and 7950X3D, respectively, provided by AMD.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The performance of these new Ryzen X3D chips vary significantly when put to work on non-gaming tasks. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD Ryzen 7xxx with V-Cache" class="wp-image-1444843" height="590" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/7950X3D-content-creation-perf.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Content-creation performance of the Ryzen 9 7950X3D.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">AMD</p></div>



<p>AMD hasn&rsquo;t released the pricing of these new X3D chips. You can probably expect them to be more expensive than a &ldquo;generic&rdquo; Ryzen thanks to all of that additional V-Cache. But by how much? For that, we&rsquo;ll have to wait and see. Until then, here&rsquo;s a peek under the hood of the Ryzen 9 7950X3D. If you look closely you can even see the cache!</p>

<p>AMD announced three affordable new 65W desktop Ryzen processors at CES 2023, continuing to bundle them with a stock cooler to save buyers money.</p>



<p>The Ryzen 9 7900 will join the Ryzen 7 7700 and the Ryzen 5 7600, AMD said, as the new entrants to the Ryzen 7000 family. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/918007/amd-launches-ryzen-7000-with-big-performance-and-low-prices.html">AMD announced the premium Ryzen 7000 family</a> last August, with the 7600X, 7700X, 7900X, and the 7950X, designed for gaming and other high-performance applications. Those chips ranged from $299 to $699, justified by <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1074246/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-review.html">the massive performance that the Ryzen 7950X offered</a>.</p>



<p>AMD&rsquo;s new chips are designed for tighter budgets, with pricing ranging from $229 to $429 instead. Not only is the company offering a processor with less expensive alternatives, but the new Ryzens are outperforming the Ryzen 5xxx generation by a substantive amount, both in terms of content creation as well as gaming.</p>



<p>Here are the details of the new processors. All are rated for 65W, use the AM5 platform, and are overclockable. They also use AMD&rsquo;s Zen 4 architecture and are fabricated on a 5nm process technology.</p>



<ul><li><strong>AMD Ryzen 9 7900</strong>: 12 cores / 24 threads, up to 5.4GHz turbo, <strong>$429</strong></li><li><strong>AMD Ryzen 7 7700</strong>: 8 cores / 16 threads, up to 5.3GHz turbo, <strong>$329</strong></li><li><strong>AMD Ryzen 5 7600</strong>: 6 cores / 12 threads, up to 5.1GHz turbo, <strong>$229</strong></li></ul>

<p>AMD is touting considerable performance advantages over the previous generation, but it&rsquo;s also making a notable comparison against Intel&rsquo;s 13th-generation Core chip as well. AMD claims that its new Ryzen 5 7600 offers equal or better performance than the Core i5-13600K, but at roughly half the power&mdash;65W vs 125W.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s not clear whether AMD&rsquo;s performance estimates are using its in-box stock coolers, but we can assume so.</p>

<p>Check out how AMD claims that its new Ryzen 7000 desktop processors compare against its earlier chips in the slides below. While AMD is obviously selecting some of its most advantageous performance benchmarks as points of comparison, these results still show off strong generation-over-generation gains. </p>



<p>Remember, if these results aren&rsquo;t strong enough for you, AMD also announced its latest Ryzen 7000 processors with V-Cache, which will increase performance even further.</p>

<p>AMD&rsquo;s midrange Ryzen 7 7700 is typically a top choice for value, along with the Ryzen 5 series.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear, however, how prices will be affected over time. Recent reports have suggested demand for desktops remains strong and has increased, while laptop demand has plunged. That could keep the price of the Ryzen 7 7000 from falling too far, too fast.</p>

<p>The gaming benchmarks AMD published for the Ryzen 5 7600 suggest that the chip will perform strongest in CPU-bound games. But content creation seems to take advantage of the new chip&rsquo;s capabilities.</p>

<p>Not to be outdone by Nvidia, AMD&rsquo;s graphics business opened CES with four new mobile RDNA3 GPUs, along with upgrades to the accompanying graphics technologies.</p>



<p>AMD launched the Radeon RX 7600M XT and RX 7600M, both GPUs pegged at improving 1080p gaming on laptops. The complementary Radeon RX 7770S and RX 7600S are aimed at thin-and-light laptops with up to 100W of power consumption. AMD also announced two upcoming software technologies: HYPR-RX, a master control of sorts to enable all of AMD&rsquo;s gaming features, as well as SmartShift RSR, which will help balance upscaling technology on supported laptops. </p>



<p>Whereas <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1445469/nvidia-unleashes-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-rtx-40-series-laptops-and-more.html">Nvidia announced the RTX 4090/4080 GPUs</a> for laptops without much accompanying detail, AMD did a bit better. Still, we&rsquo;re left wondering on some of the key details. </p>



<p>AMD announced the last-gen <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394643/amd-announces-three-radeon-rx-6000m-gpus.html">Radeon RX 6600M, 6700M, and 6800M in May 2021</a>. The RX 6600M included 8 compute units/ray accelerators, 8GB of GDDR6 memory, a game clock of 2,177MHz, 128-bit memory interface, and 32MB of Infinity Cache. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD Radeon RX 7600M XT specs" class="wp-image-1445741" height="700" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/7600M-specs.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">AMD</p></div>



<p>All we know about the RX 7600M XT and RX 7600M is that they&rsquo;re a step up to the RDNA3 architecture. The RX 7600M XT includes 8GB of GDDR6 memory across a 128-bit memory bus, with 32 TFLOPS of FP32 power. The RX 7600M offers the same memory and bus width, with 28 TFLOPs instead. However, we don&rsquo;t know the number of compute units/ray accelerators, nor the game clock. (In the RX6600M, they were 28 CUs and 2,177MHz, respectively.)</p>



<p>From a performance standpoint, however, there are some clear advantages: the 7600M XT is 26 percent faster across popular gaming titles, according to AMD. AMD is also claiming that the 7600M XT is faster than both the RTX 3060 8GB and 12GB variants, as well.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-jetpack-image-compare"><div class="juxtapose"><img alt="AMD Radeon RX 7600M XT gaming" class="image-compare__image-before" height="1225" id="1445746" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/RX7600M-XT-gaming-1.png" width="2417" /><img alt="AMD Radeon RX 7600M XT gaming" class="image-compare__image-after" height="1208" id="1445745" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/7600M-XT-gaming-2.png" width="2370" /></div><figcaption>AMD compared the RX7600M XT to both its own 6600M as well as Nvidia&rsquo;s desktop GeForce RTX 3060.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Meanwhile, the RX 7700S and 7600S have similar designs; they too are both offered with 8GB of GDDR6 memory and a 128-bit memory bus. The RX 7600S includes 28 32-bit TFLOPS, while the 7700S can perform 32 TFLOPS.</p>



<p>The new mobile GPUs will be built into the Alienware M18 and M16, the Asus TUF Gaming A16, the Emdoor APX970 and AG958GP, and the IP3 ARN37A.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD Radeon RX 7700S 7600S" class="wp-image-1445742" height="721" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/RX7700S-specs.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">AMD</p></div>



<p>Naturally, AMD believes that its new GPUs offer substantial advantages in thin-and-light laptops. AMD compared the new GPUs to the older 6700S.</p>



<p>Interestingly, all four of the new GPUs consume the same die space and use the same process technology.</p>

<h2 id="new-software-enhancements-en-route">New software enhancements en route</h2>



<p>All four GPUs will include support for AV1 hardware encode and decode, AMD noise suppression, and content-adaptive machine-learning and AI visual analysis to help preserve text, according to Aaron Steinman,&nbsp;senior manager of Radeon product management at&nbsp;AMD.</p>



<p>Three additional software technologies are worth noting. In the first half of 2023 AMD will ship SmartShift RSR, a technology that will free discrete GPU resources but offloading any upscaling calculations to the APU, Steinman said. AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) will launch a 3.0 version that will offer enhancements like better upscaling and fluid motion frames. Finally, AMD Software will support HYPR-RX, a one-button control that combines Radeon Anti-Lag, Radeon Boost, Radeon Super Resolution, and more, Steinman said &mdash; flipping on HYPR-RX will turn these features on, too. They&rsquo;ll be available sometime in the first half of 2023, AMD said.</p>
