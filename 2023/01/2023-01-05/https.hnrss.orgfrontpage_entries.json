All services no longer show the stranger accessing them - with the exception of YouTube.<p>The actions I've taken multiple times (as instructed by Google support):\n- Changed my Google account's password\n- Revoked all \"devices I trust\" under my 2FA settings\n- Logged out of all devices in the \"Your Devices\" list<p>This did force me to log back in on my own devices (phone, TV), but I still see new videos that the stranger watched in my YouTube history.\nThis has been happening for weeks.<p>Google support walked me through these steps and then gave generic \"make sure your password are strong\" article links, but of course, refuse to escalate this.<p>If you wish, you can view the support transcripts here (I admittedly got a little short during the 2nd conversation, which I regret):\nhttps://pastebin.com/GypwBPFj<p>---<p>Some details:<p>- The videos in my view history are in Arabic, so I know it's the stranger who watches them<p>- I know the stranger has access through my old TV because I saw their activity on all apps I had installed on my TV, and I saw my old TV signed in from a distant city under \"Your Devices\" list</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a

with real books", "date_published": "2023-01-05 16:18:39+00:00", "description": "<p>Hi HN,<p>We\u2019re Elizabeth, Catalin, and Tom - the founders of Ello (<a href=\"https://www.helloello.com\">https://www.helloello.com</a>). Ello is an AI-powered app that mimics the one-on-one interaction of a reading tutor by listening to, encouraging, and coaching kids grade K-3 as they read out loud from a real book.<p>We posted on HN back in 2020 when we launched Trustle, a company designed to pair families with dedicated experts in child development. We learned from that experience that parents don\u2019t want a consultant, but they do want actual help with specific challenges\u2014one of the biggest being reading.<p>Prior to COVID, 65% of 4th graders in the U.S. were reading behind level. The most recent National Assessment of Educational Progress report revealed that reading levels have dropped even further, to the lowest level since 1992. These disheartening statistics reinforce something we learned during our time at Trustle\u2014of all the pain points parents face in raising children, reading can often be one of the most critical yet most difficult to address, especially if the child doesn\u2019t like to read.<p>In an effort to help reverse this trend, we used advances in speech recognition - driven by self-supervised learning - to create a virtual experience designed to provide effective reading support. It's no substitute for attention and coaching from a caring adult, which is obviously what kids really need, but unfortunately that is not always available.<p>If every child had consistent access to 1:1 reading support and every parent or caregiver had the time, language skills, and confidence to help their children learn to read with no outside assistance, then there would not be a need for a technical solution.  Unfortunately, we know not every child has this access, and many parents are looking for extra support. That's why we've built Ello.<p>If you look at a great teacher or parent working with a child, they are talking to each other. Ello uses a speech recognition model that listens to what a child is saying and provides the appropriate phonics based coaching, as well as commentary and help. As a child reads across the page of a physical book, the Ello app tracks the child\u2019s progress and picks up when they miss a word or get a word wrong and then steps in just like a good reading coach would.<p>One criticism that we\u2019ve heard since launching is that we are trying to replace the sacred role of a parent teaching their child to read. We say, \u201cNot at all!\u201d. Ello can serve as a resource for every type of parent without being a \u201creplacement\u201d, which is impossible in any case.<p>We\u2019ve had most success with children who are reluctant readers.  Ello provides a fun environment to practice reading without the pressure of an adult watching you. We\u2019ve seen kids who flat out refuse to read start to enjoy reading in a short period of time.<p>We are highly privacy oriented; unlike most apps relying on speech tracking we can work completely on device with no internet and no audio data shared back with us.<p>We launched in early in 2022 and have come a long way since then. The model works like this: we mail customers five books and a prepaid return shipping label every month. At the end of the month you mail the books back or keep as many as you want for an additional $5 apiece, and then we mail you next month\u2019s box. Our reading specialists help determine the appropriate reading level for every child and make sure that we are sending books to match. Right now we support roughly K through 3rd grade, although Ello can be effective for some Pre-K kids as well.<p>We know there are many parents on HN, including those with young children. We would love to hear about your experiences and needs around your children\u2019s reading journeys and your perspective on how something like Ello might help. Or, if you\u2019re in the US, give us a try (we are only in the US as we ship physical books right now, but are launching a digital only version in the first half of this year and then will be available more broadly) - you can get a free month with code ellohacker. And of course we welcome any feedback, questions, and ideas!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a

"date_published": "2023-01-05 00:55:54+00:00", "description": "<p>I am sure most of you noticed the trend, but a lot of folks online, from influencers on twitter/instagram/tiktok to CEOs of some companies who were big on crypto, web3 (I never understood what that even means) now switched completely to AI/ML with the popularity of DALL-E/ChatGPT.<p>Me and some of my colleagues are fairly active on the MachineLearning subreddit and we've been getting a lot of unsolicited dms to collaborate in a breakthrough ML/AI project. The conversations start something like this: https://imgur.com/a/z6GUTGc Yup, you guessed it, they have the idea and we have to implement it. They don't even have the dataset. One guy proposed my friend that he has a startup idea to use GPT-model to let people talk to their pets and that it should be 'fairly easy' to finetune from an existing model.<p>I am already fairly tired of seeing all the ChatGPT stuff on my socials, and I am not looking forward to another few years of more low effort/low quality stuff in peak of inflated expectations phase. I love GPT, I have many pipelines where I actively use it, but I also see the potential where people will abuse it, in every form from  increased spam, personalized phishing, etc. Imagine scammers calling your grand parents not with an non-native accent anymore - heck maybe with your own voice (which in my head is fairly easy to do - get someone's family tree, call the grandkid using a model fine-tuned on some local accent, perhaps of the opposite gender and engage them in a conversation - use the voice clips to finetune another model and then call their parents/grandparents to get money, heck even the transcript for the scam interaction can be auto-generated). I am a first-generation college student, and getting my parents to use a smartphone has itself been a challenge - there's no way I can teach them to identify sophisticated scams. I bracing myself and not looking forward for all of this to come.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34254377\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34254377</a></p>\n<p>Points: 21</p>\n<p># Comments: 4</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/01/ftc-cracks-down-companies-impose-harmful-noncompete-restrictions-thousands-workers", "title": "FTC Cracks Down on Companies That Impose Harmful Noncompete Restrictions", "date_published": "2023-01-05 00:38:43+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/01/ftc-cracks-down-companies-impose-harmful-noncompete-restrictions-thousands-workers\">https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/01/ftc-cracks-down-companies-impose-harmful-noncompete-restrictions-thousands-workers</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34254183\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34254183</a></p>\n<p>Points: 64</p>\n<p># Comments: 13</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}], "source": {"url": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Hacker News - frontpage"}}
