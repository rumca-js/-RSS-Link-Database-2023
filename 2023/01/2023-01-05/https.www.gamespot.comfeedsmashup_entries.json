Since then, his daughter Stephanie McMahon has stepped up to be co-CEO of the company, alongside Nick Khan, while his son-in-law Paul \"Triple H\" Levesque has taken creative control over the company's product. That could all be changing, though, as McMahon is reportedly plotting a return.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">According to a new report from the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/vince-mcmahon-plots-return-to-wwe-11672952709\">Wall Street Journal</a>, McMahon is looking to return to the company's board of directors and bring allies with him to the board in the form of former WWE co-presidents and directors Michelle Wilson and George Barrios. Per the WSJ, the move is to seek a sale of the company. Currently, McMahon has the voting majority in the company due to the stock he owns.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As the WSJ explains, McMahon has let the board know he intends to use his voting power to elect himself, Wilson, and Barrios to the board. Previously, the board had turned down McMahon's efforts to return. It's also worth noting that the three returning would mean three current directors would have to vacate their roles, though there's no word on who that would be.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vince-mcmahon-plotting-wwe-return-to-sell-the-company-report/1100-6510355/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/videos/ps5-shortage-is-over-according-to-playstation-gamespot-news/2300-6460327/", "title": "PS5 Shortage Is Over, According To PlayStation | GameSpot News", "date_published": "2023-01-05 21:31:00+00:00", "description": "<img height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1574/15746725/4083153-news0105_v0.jpg\" width=\"480\" /> So you want a PS5, huh?

But a closer look at the game itself appears to reveal the answer: The Underworld battle pass is still set to expire on January 10, but a look at the Season Hub reveals February 14 as the new end date for Season 3--over a month before its planned expiration date.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The fact that Season 3's end date has changed while the Underworld battle pass's expiration date has remained the same suggests that a third Season 3 battle pass may be on the way. This also occurred at the end of Season 2, when a third, much shorter battle pass was released to keep players occupied until the beginning of Season 3.

However, it features a limited roster of characters. There are seven heroes to choose from: Ramattra, Junker Queen, Reinhardt, Roadhog, Pharah, Widowmaker, and Lucio--each of whom has a divine version of their ultimate ability. These divine ultimate abilities last longer than the normal versions and provide special buffs to the other abilities of each character. For example, Reinhardt can pin up to three enemies at once with his charge and, if he hits them into a wall, he heals, for 20 seconds after using his ultimate. While Widowmaker's ultimate is active, any enemy that looks at her while she is scoped turns to stone.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">There are 18 challenges related to the Battle for Olympus event, rewarding battle pass XP, titles, voice lines, and the Legendary Winged Victory Mercy skin, which was previously available during the Summer Games event in previous years.

But what they did have was a sheer volume of mainstream, accessible content that it could cycle in and out every month.</p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"[Various] Sign up for Amazon Prime Video\">    <div class=\"buylink__container\">                                                                                                                                                                                               <div class=\"buylink__item\">                  <div class=\"buylink__image-container clickable\">                                            <img alt=\"\" class=\"buylink__image\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1591/15918215/3807447-primevideo.jpg\" />                                 <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/offers/ref=atv_dp_signup_3p_bb?tag=gs-buybutton-20&amp;ascsubtag=[subid_value]&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\"></a>                              </div>                   <div class=\"buylink__text\">                      <p class=\"buylink__title text-bold\">                        <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/offers/ref=atv_dp_signup_3p_bb?tag=gs-buybutton-20&amp;ascsubtag=[subid_value]&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\">Sign up for Prime Video</a>           </p>                                                       <p class=\"buylink__deck\">                          <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/offers/ref=atv_dp_signup_3p_bb?tag=gs-buybutton-20&amp;ascsubtag=[subid_value]&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\">Prime offers a 30-day free trial, and you can cancel anytime.</a>             </p>                                              </div>                  <div class=\"buylink__links\">                                                                                                                                                          <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/offers/ref=atv_dp_signup_3p_bb?tag=gs-buybutton-20&amp;ascsubtag=[subid_value]&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\">See Prime Video at Amazon</a>                     </div>                         </div>                     </div> </div></div><p dir=\"ltr\">And action movies, in particular, are a great way to draw eyes to a platform. They have mainstream appeal; they get at our base, common instincts for violence, retribution, and survival. And although they may not have the critical acclaim of, say, period dramas or indie comedies, action movies are inherently cinematic, in a way that those films are not. A proper action scene prioritizes angles and shots. It demands panning, tracking, and tilting--all the kinetic stuff that can only exist in film and cannot be reproduced in any other medium. A great action movie exists in a class of its own.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Here are 20 of the best action movies currently streaming on Amazon Prime--an eclectic mix of established classics and modern classics alike.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. Patriot Games</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4079105-1.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Starring: </strong>Harrison Ford, Anne Archer</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Director(s): </strong>Phillip Noyce</p><p dir=\"ltr\">You can't go wrong with a Harrison Ford classic, especially one where Ford plays Tom Clancy hero Jack Ryan. When an IRA terrorist named Sean Miller escapes custody, he seeks revenge on Ryan's family. Ryan must track Miller down and put him away, this time for good. Ford emotes in every frame; he's a father on a mission to protect those he loves at any cost.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. Train to Busan</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4079106-2.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Starring: </strong>Gong Yoo, Jung Yu-mi</p><p><strong>Director(s): </strong>It is a zombie action movie, at its base level. But on a deeper level, it's a story of a man who takes responsibility for his life and becomes a good father to his daughter. Fast zombies are terrifying in a more urgent, immediate way than their slow, plodding predecessors, and the sprinters in <em>Train to Busan</em> exist in a class of their own.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. Fist of Fury</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4079107-3.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Starring: </strong>Bruce Lee</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Director(s):</strong> Lo Wei</p><p>Also known to audiences as <em>The Chinese Connection</em>, this is Bruce's second lead film. He plays a kung fu student who seeks revenge against the Japanese karate school he suspects of murdering his master. Come for Bruce's undeniable magnetism; stay for the incredible nunchuck fight sequence.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. Road House</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4079108-4.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Starring: </strong>Patrick Swayze</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Director(s): </strong>Rowdy Herrington</p><p dir=\"ltr\">It's an '80s classic starring Patrick Swayze as a handsome bouncer with an epic mullet who protects a small town from big business corruption. Road House falls into the 'so bad it's good' category and knows not to take itself too seriously. And the action is great; the punches and kicks are nothing fancy, but they always look like they hurt.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4079109-5.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Starring: </strong>Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler, Viggo Mortensen</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Director(s): </strong>Peter Jackson</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The middle chapter of Peter Jackson's original Middle-earth trilogy is the strongest of the three, and the Battle of Helm's Deep is one of the finest battles ever committed to film. It took 120 days and 20000 extras to film, and it lasted 40 minutes of screentime.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. Once Upon A Time in China</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4079110-6.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Starring: </strong>Jet Li, Yuen Biao, Rosamund Kwan</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Director(s): </strong>Hark Tsui</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Director Hark Tsui viewed Guangdong, near the fall of the Qing Dynasty, as a Wild West of sorts, and he framed Chinese folk hero Wong Fei-Hung as its Sergio Leone-inspired protector\u2014standing up for the common man in the face of foreign threats. This movie brought Jet Li to mainstream audiences, and two more Hark-Tsui-directed sequels followed in its wake.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. Star Trek: Into Darkness</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4079111-7.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Starring: </strong>Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Benedict Cumberbatch</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Director(s): </strong>J.J. Abrams</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The highest grossing Star Trek film is also widely disliked by the core fanbase. But although it may not be the best Star Trek film, it is an exceptional sci-fi action film. Director J.J. Abrams knows how to create a crowd pleasing set piece, and the climactic sequence, where the Enterprise crew saves the ship from crashing into Earth, is edited beautifully, and showcases how everyone did their part to prevent total disaster.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>8. No Time to Die</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4079112-8.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Starring: </strong>Daniel Craig, L\u00e9a Seydoux, Rami Malek, Lashana Lynch</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Director(s): </strong>Cary Joji Fukunaga</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Daniel Craig's lasting outing as Bond pits him against terrorists who have manufactured a DNA-targeting nanobot. This is an older Bond who comes out of retirement for one last mission. He's putting it all on the line; there are only so many times that one can risk life and limb before the odds catch up.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>9. The Tomorrow War</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4079113-9.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Starring: </strong>Chris Pratt, Yvonne Strahovski, J. K. Simmons</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Director(s): </strong>Chris McKay</p><p dir=\"ltr\">A big budget Amazon Original, this movie envisions a future where present-day citizens are drafted to fight a future war against hostile aliens. It's got a great message, and our heroes shift their focus from winning the war in the future to preventing the future war in the present.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>10. World War Z</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4079114-10.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Starring: </strong>Brad Pitt</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Director(s): </strong>Marc Forster</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This zombie movie swaps out creepy, atmospheric horror for high-budget, high-octane action thrills. The zombies have a bizarre hive-mind psychology, climbing, trampling and scaling each other with utter lack of humanity. The destruction of Israel is a particularly nasty highlight; it only takes a single breach for civilization to go to hell.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>11. The Commuter</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4079115-11.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Starring:</strong> Liam Neeson</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Director(s): </strong>Jaume Serra</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Liam Neeson, who had one of the most unexpected, late-career resurgences as an action hero, stars as a former NYPD officer, who gets unwittingly sucked into a criminal conspiracy while riding the train home. The movie wrings every bit of suspense out of its premise, and the train slowly descends into chaos and outright violence.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>12. The Protege</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4079116-12.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Starring: </strong>Michael Keaton, Maggie Q, Samuel L. Jackson</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Director(s):</strong> Martin Campbell</p><p dir=\"ltr\">It's a revenge tale, starring Maggie Q as a contract hitwoman who sets out to kill the people who killed her mentor (Samuel L. Jackson). Largely relegated to supporting roles in the past, Maggie Q makes a wonderful action lead in this movie. The more we see of her moving forward, the better.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>13. Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4079117-13.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Starring: </strong>Skip Stellrecht, Eddie Frierson, Lia Sargent</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Director(s):</strong> Gisaburo Sugii</p><p>If you've only seen the Jean-Claude Van Damme version of <em>Street Fighter,</em> then you owe it to yourself to see the superior animated movie. The action centerpiece is the Chun-Li versus Vega fight, which begins when the Spanish Ninja infiltrates Chun's apartment and attempts to kill her.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>14. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4079118-14.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Starring: </strong>Chow Yun Fat, Michelle Yeoh, Zhang Ziyi</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Director(s): </strong>Ang Lee</p><p>This movie was the West's first exposure to the <em>wuxia</em> genre. It's a dramatic epic and a love story, where the plot stands on equal footing to the balletic action. Its popularity was groundbreaking at the time; never before had a foreign language film performed so well in the United States.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>15. Man on Fire</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4079119-15.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Starring:</strong> Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning, Christopher Walken</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Director(s): </strong>Tony Scott</p><p>In the early 2000's, Denzel Washington began taking on gritty anti-hero roles\u2014most notably, in <em>Training Day</em>, where he played a corrupt LAPD detective, and in this movie, where he played an embittered CIA agent on a quest for brutal, sadistic revenge. It's liberating for Denzel to play, and it's uncomfortable for us to watch.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>16. Wrath of Man</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4079120-16.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Starring: </strong>Jason Statham</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Director(s): </strong>Guy Ritchie</p><p>Action director Guy Ritchie made his name by directing lean, darkly funny action thrillers. But in <em>Wrath of Man</em>, he dialed down the laughs and made something grimmer and more tense, with a heist subplot and a couple of perfect twists.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>17. Drunken Master</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4079121-17.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Starring: </strong>Jackie Chan</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Director(s): </strong>Woo-Ping Yuen</p><p>An archetypal Jackie Chan action comedy, the original <em>Drunken Master</em> casts Chan as Wong Fei-Hung, the real life martial artist and physician who became a folk hero after the fall of the Qing Dynasty. It popularized the obscure martial arts discipline of Drunken Boxing, which Chan turned into his signature style.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>18. Robocop</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4079122-18.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Starring: </strong>Joel Kinnaman, Gary Oldman, Samuel L. Jackson</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Director(s): </strong>Jose Padilha</p><p dir=\"ltr\">A remake of the original 1987 film, Robocop is about a Detroit police detective who, after being injured in the line of duty, is rebuilt with a cyborg body to fight crime. What was once a sci-fi 'what-if' is slowly gaining real-life relevance, as police and military begin incorporating drones and cybernetic dogs into their departments.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>19. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4079123-19.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Starring: </strong>Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Director(s): </strong>Francis Lawrence</p><p>The second <em>Hunger Games</em> book/movie ups the stakes by having prior Hunger Games winners fight other prior Hunger Games winners. The paranoia and fear in the first film are replaced with something more strategic and twisted; which of these 24 experienced killers can rise to the top? And how can Katniss possibly survive this time?</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>20. Samaritan</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4079124-20.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Starring: </strong>Sylvester Stallone</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Director(s):</strong> Julius Avery</p><p>Samaritan is the latest in a series of postmodern superhero films, starting with M. Night Shymalan's <em>Unbreakable</em> in 2000<em>. </em>A troubled kid suspects that his neighbor is a superhero\u2014long thought to be dead\u2014and tries to recruit him to defeat a dangerous criminal gang.</p></h3></p><br />", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jeremy-renner-shares-photo-and-video-revealing-his-injuries-after-major-snowplowing-accident/1100-6510233/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Jeremy Renner Shares Photo And Video Revealing His Injuries After Major Snowplowing Accident", "date_published": "2023-01-05 13:43:00+00:00", "description": "<p><strong>[UPDATE 3] </strong>A video released by Renner from the ICU shows Renner having a \"spa day\" with his sister and mother. </p><div><blockquote align=\"center\" class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\">A \u201cnot no great\u201d ICU DAY, turned to amazing spa day with my sis and mama\u2764\ufe0f.

The OLED screen retains all of LG's excellent picture quality, but all the data and video that it displays is beamed directly to it from a wireless transmitter box. You'll still need a power supply for the LG M3, but you won't have to worry about a rat's nest of cables behind your TV.</p><p>That box contains all the standard input ports that you'd find at the back of a typical TV, and sends video and audio signals wirelessly to the LG M3. The company says that the box is capable of real-time video and audio transmission at up to 4K 120Hz and is designed to create a cleaner and distraction-free viewing environment for users. To ensure zero lag, LG says that it has developed an algorithm that instantly identifies the optimal transmission path.</p><figure style=\"width: 1280px;\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4082795-lg-2.jpg\"><img alt=\"Good luck finding a wall big enough for the LG M3.\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4082795-lg-2.jpg\" /></a><figcaption>Good luck finding a wall big enough for the LG M3.</figcaption></figure><p>The box can be located up to 30 feet away from the TV, and comes with three HDMI ports for gaming, as well as an antenna for TV, USB ports, optical digital out, and an ethernet port. The end result is a TV that exists purely as a screen, which can allow for simpler installations and a more minimalist appearance. If 97 inches is too big for your home, the M3 will also be available in 83- and 77-inch configurations.
