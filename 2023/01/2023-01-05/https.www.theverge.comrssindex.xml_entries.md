  <p id="Ni5fS9">A deluge of storms is dumping serious amounts of rain across notoriously dry California. Even so, this week’s downpours are still nowhere near enough to pull the state out of its intense years-long drought. </p>
<p id="KoMRTe">A bomb cyclone is working its way across the state today, flooding homes and roads and knocking out power for hundreds of thousands of residents. Officials <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/sfchronicle/status/1610723207744454661">warned</a> it could be the worst storm to crash into California in years — even though it’s just one in a series of storms to pass through in the span of a couple weeks.</p>
<p id="aQ9cdn">It all comes on the heels of a long dry stretch for the Golden State. 2022 marked the end of the <a href="https://water.ca.gov/News/News-Releases/2022/Oct-22/New-Water-Year-Begins-Amid-Preparations-for-Continued-Drought">driest three-year period</a> for the state on record.

  <p id="nDMmsX">The Federal Trade Commission is looking to ban noncompete clauses in employment contracts, which companies put in place to prevent employees from going to work for competitors or leaving to start similar businesses. On Thursday, the regulator <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/federal-register-notices/non-compete-clause-rulemaking">issued a notice of proposed rulemaking</a>, saying that the clauses hurt innovation and “decrease competition for workers,” which leads to lower wages overall.</p>

  <p id="yiXZ1j">Razer and Verizon co-announced the pricing for the 5G-enabled Edge gaming handheld during CES 2023. It’s launching on January 26th for $359.99 when you add it as a new tablet line to your account. With an installment plan, Verizon says the math works out to $10 per month for 36 months. This pricing is available for a limited time, but a timeframe wasn’t provided by Verizon, so we’ve followed up to find out. The retail price for the 5G model is $599.99, which is $200 more than the Wi-Fi-only model. </p>

  <p id="Y5PC8L">The Android Auto look and feel has evolved greatly since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/26/8659671/android-auto-in-car-system-review-smartphone-hyundai-sonata">we reviewed it in 2015</a>, but <a href="https://blog.google/products/best-of-Android-to-improve-your-drive">now its biggest update is starting to roll out to all users</a>, introducing a split-screen UI that can let you see more things at once. Keeping the map on screen while also adding one or two other panes makes it a bit more like Apple’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18693555/apple-ios-13-carplay-interface-update-hands-on-test-review">current approach to CarPlay</a>, and Google says its focus is on creating a “more personal, easy-to-use experience from behind the wheel.”</p>
<p id="bOnOgB">Wherever the inspiration comes from, I appreciate it.

<p id="WboD5q">Starting this year, the companies will begin the work to construct hundreds of new hubs, which will include more than 2,500 DC fast charging plugs.

Spectricity is debuting its new S1 multispectral sensor at CES 2023, and it could be headed to smartphones on store shelves sooner than later.</p>
<p id="16j2fM">Standard camera sensors are limited to using certain bands of the visible spectrum — red, green, and blue. The S1, which is designed to complement the main camera system, can gather much more data, including in the near-infrared range. The company says this results in better color reproduction and more accurate skin tones, and it has big aspirations for this technology: CEO Vincent Mouret says he expects <em>all</em> smartphones to incorporate it “within the...</p>

  <p id="AMksW7">Nvidia’s latest RTX 4070 Ti graphics card goes on sale in the US and across Europe today. The “unlaunched” 12GB RTX 4080 is now the RTX 4070 Ti, with a $799 starting price point. That price, although still high, is key for this new GPU. AMD’s $899 Radeon RX 7900 XT <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23538558/nvidia-rtx-4070-ti-review-gpu-graphics-card-benchmark-test">beats Nvidia’s RTX 4070 Ti in many titles at both 1440p and 4K</a>, so the $100 price difference really has to hold.</p>
<p id="xZOqrr">Nvidia had planned to launch the RTX 4070 Ti as an $899 12GB RTX 4080 version. The company faced widespread criticism over pricing and how much more powerful the 16GB RTX 4080 was. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/14/23404595/nvidia-rtx-408-12gb-unlaunch">Nvidia admitted in October</a> that “having two GPUs with the 4080 designation is confusing,” before saying it was pausing the launch of the 12GB RTX 4080.</p>

The ATH-M50xSTS comes with a 3.5mm headphone jack and XLR microphone connector (with a one-fourth-inch adaptor in the box), while the ATH-M50xSTS-USB has a USB-A connector and USB-C adaptor in the box. But the most important spec is that both headphones use the same 45mm drivers that have made the M50X headphones so popular across the internet. </p>

Apple describes the new “digital narration” feature <a href="https://authors.apple.com/support/4519-digital-narration-audiobooks">on its website</a> as making “the creation of audiobooks more accessible to all,” by reducing “the cost and complexity” of producing them for authors and publishers. </p>
<p id="tXsBXy">The feature represents a big shift from the current audiobook model, which often involves authors narrating their own books in a process that can take weeks and cost thousands for a publisher.

  <p id="R9B2XB">AMD is bringing its RDNA 3 graphics architecture to laptops this year. The chip giant is promising RTX 3060-level desktop graphics on the latest laptops featuring its new Radeon RX 7600M XT GPUs. That’s games like <em>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla</em> running at 100fps at 1080p, <em>Borderlands 3</em> hitting 106fps, and <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider </em>reaching 142fps.</p>
<p id="KPHgu4">At the top end, AMD will offer laptop manufacturers the Radeon RX 7600M XT or RX 7600M. The RX 7600M XT has 32 teraflops of performance paired with 8GB of GDDR6 memory. The RX 7600M has 28 teraflops of performance with 8GB of GDDR6 memory. Both discrete GPUs are built on the RDNA 3 architecture and a 6nm process and will support AV1 encode and decode.

  <p id="GgjsW3">AMD is bringing its impressive 3D V-Cache technology to its Ryzen 7000 desktop processors. Starting in February, the Ryzen 9 7950X3D, 7900X3D, and 7800X3D will all start shipping with some big promises of PC gaming and productivity gains. AMD could be about to regain the PC performance crown it lost to Intel’s Core i9-13900K just a few months ago.</p>
<p id="2E2y1x">There’s reason to be excited if you’re just about to build a PC gaming rig. AMD’s first desktop chip to use its 3D V-Cache technology, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22856151/amd-ryzen-7000-desktop-cpu-5nm-next-gen-zen-4-release-date-ces-2022">the Ryzen 7 5800X3D</a>, outclassed its own Ryzen 5900X and Intel’s 12th Gen Core i9-12900K last year for PC gaming. Even against the Core i9-13900K, it held its own in a number of games.</p>

<p id="A85uW6">The potential star of the show is the “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/3/23056024/amd-dragon-range-zen-4-extreme-gaming-laptop-cpu-ryzen">Dragon Range</a>” Zen 4 Ryzen 9 7945HX, which has 16 cores and 32 threads, frequencies of 2.2-5.4 Ghz, 80MB cache, and 55-75 watt TDP. I repeat — 16 cores in a laptop. These aren’t Intel’s little efficiency cores. These are 16 full Zen cores in a laptop’s chassis. </p>

  <p id="H6Jql8">The PlayStation 5 shortage is finally over — at least according to Sony. “Everyone who wants a PS5 should have a much easier time finding one at retailers globally, starting from this point forward,” said Jim Ryan, the company’s gaming boss, <a href="https://youtu.be/UVMcjxW68Bc?t=3423">during its CES presentation</a>. The company also announced that it’s sold around 30 million consoles at this point. That’s around 5 million more than the last time it <a href="https://sea.ign.com/news/192049/playstation-5-has-passed-25-million-units-sold-sony-producing-more-than-expected">released sales numbers in November</a>.</p>
<p id="N4wzfx">It’s been a long time getting to this point; the PlayStation 5 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review">launched in November 2020</a>, and it wasn’t until August 2022 that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/19/23312949/ps5-console-restock-playstation-5">we declared it “almost easy to buy.”</a> For most of the console’s life, getting one required you to be either very lucky, relatively on-the-spot with drops, or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22771984/ps5-restock-xbox-best-buy-walmart-amazon-subscription">willing to pay...</a></p>
