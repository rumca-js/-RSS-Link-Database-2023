Throughout spells at Dundee United, Rangers, Everton, Newcastle and Everton again, the fearsome striker enjoyed hero status, scored some memorable goals, and got himself in several on- and off-field scrapes, seemingly managing to do so without so much as a single public utterance. This refusal to stand in front of a microphone may have had its origins in a court conviction for an on-field incident that even nowadays would merit little more than a red card and certainly not the three-month stretch in the Big House handed down by a Scottish beak. Not entirely unreasonably, Big Dunc felt he had been the victim of a stitch-up and there were plenty who agreed with him.</p><p>That photo of Jacob Murphy waving off Duje Caleta-Car after his red card (yesterday\u2019s News, Bits and Bobs, full email edition) made me think: why stop there? Next time the opposition receive a red card, maybe the other team can form a guard of (dis)honour, all wave and clap as the disgraced red-carder departs the pitch, walking off on a hastily-deployed red carpet, to the sound of a 21-gun salute from canons specially deployed on top of the stand, as the floodlights flash from white to red, and Nelson Muntz\u2019s trademark \u2018ha-haaaa\u2019 played on a loop. Maybe a quick entry in the \u2018How Far Can I Kick a Drinks Bottle\u2019 competition sponsored by a betting company on the way out too, complete with officials in white coats with tape measures? And if they take an age arguing with the ref about the decision, have an opera singer stroll out to the middle of the pitch and sing the national anthem. All six verses.

Fifteen years later, I saw Sofia Coppola\u2019s film adaptation, and my instant messenger avatar became Kirsten Dunst, picking petals from a daisy, stained pink by sunset. Along with many girls in my high school, I wasted hours with digital cameras trying to capture the same dreamy aesthetic as the movie. We held bougainvillaea flowers and posed by stinking suburban lakes, hiding behind our hair, always disappointed by the results that turned out too bright, too childlike, too true.<strong> </strong></p><p>The book soon got passed around the more committed, easily-influenced-by-Tumblr girls. Although I grew up in Orlando, and the novel is set in the suburbs of mid-70s Detroit, where I have never been, the landscape felt so intensely familiar that I read it for the first time as though remembering it. I fell even more deeply in love with the five Lisbon sisters \u2013 blonde, long-haired and beloved by the boys across the street, who narrate the novel from a distance. I was as quick as the boys to believe the girls were angels: beautiful, tragically cool. I didn\u2019t realise then, but I shared a viewpoint, not with the sisters as I hoped, but with the boys who never got near them. Dumb with longing, we all completely missed the point.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/26/the-virgin-suicides-at-30-why-im-obsessed-with-this-dark-dreamy-novel\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-UK", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jan/26/sound-of-the-underground-royal-court-london", "title": "Sound of the Underground review \u2013 magnificent explosion of mesmerising drag", "date_published": "2023-01-26 12:05:46+00:00", "description": "<p><strong>Royal Court, London</strong><br />A plot to kill RuPaul for dragging drag into the mainstream, followed by song and dance numbers, fires up an exhilarating show with breathtaking costumes, radical politics and filthy humour</p><p>It takes some time for Travis Alabanza\u2019s show about the underground drag scene to set alight.

During 2018, the area surrounding South Africa\u2019s second largest city suffered months of dwindling rainfall. Dams were unable to replenish themselves at the rate its inhabitants required. Water was rationed. Businesses shut. The situation even called for its own grim version of the Doomsday Clock: hour by hour, the city ticked ever closer to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2018/feb/03/day-zero-how-cape-town-running-out-water\">Day Zero</a>, marking the end of its fresh water supply.</p><p><a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1593030/Terra_Nil/\">Terra Nil</a>, the video game that Alfred has been developing since 2019, is a response to these terrifying events. Dubbed a \u201ccity-builder in reverse\u201d, it foregoes the consumption and expansion of genre classics such as Civilisation and SimCity to paint a picture of environmental restoration. Starting with arid desert, it\u2019s up to the player to rewild a landscape using various technologies \u2013 a toxin scrubber, for example, or a beehive. At light-speed, and with eye-massaging flushes of emerald green and azure blue, the environment transforms into lush vegetation. Terra Nil\u2019s simplicity is as beautiful as its visuals, offering the satisfaction of a colouring book while doling out a clear-eyed critique of environment-wrecking extraction.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jan/26/can-video-games-change-peoples-minds-about-the-climate-crisis\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-UK", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jan/26/good-early-years-teaching-may-boost-earnings-of-children-in-england-study", "title": "Good early years teaching may boost earnings of children in England \u2013 study", "date_published": "2023-01-26 09:30:01+00:00", "description": "<p>Study reports one in 40 primary schools in England produce entire classes likely to earn more than their peers</p><p>Never mind getting a place at Oxbridge \u2013 a child\u2019s future earnings can be significantly improved by the quality of their teachers at the age of four, according to new research.</p><p>The researchers used Department for Education (DfE) databases to connect adults\u2019 earnings to the reception classes attended.

Just how much damage is this doing?</p><p>It was a Labour spokesperson who said the prime minister was behaving \u201clike an A-list celeb\u201d, after Rishi Sunak made his third trip by private jet in 10 days. Last week, he flew from London to Blackpool in a 14-seat RAF jet \u2013 a 230-mile journey that would have taken about three hours by train. The week before, he did the same to Leeds, which he could have done in two and a half hours by train, but which wouldn\u2019t have looked nearly so glamorous \u2013 to go by the ludicrous photograph of him looking important and being saluted as he boarded the aircraft.</p><p>Private planes are up to 14 times more polluting, per passenger, than commercial planes and 50 times more polluting than trains, according to a report by Transport &amp; Environment, a European clean transport campaign organisation. \u201cIt goes against the fact that the government has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/24/net-zero-by-2050-in-england-and-wales-equals-extra-2m-years-of-life?ref=upstract.com\">committed to net zero by 2050</a>,\u201d says Alice Ridley, a spokesperson for the Campaign for Better Transport. \u201cThey have said they want to see more journeys by public transport, walking and cycling. Taking a private jet is extremely damaging for the environment, especially when there are other alternatives that would be far less polluting and would also be cheaper.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/26/flying-shame-the-scandalous-rise-of-private-jets\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-UK", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/26/warming-europe-ski-resorts-photo-essay-satellite-images-winter-lack-of-snow", "title": "In stark contrast: the warming of Europe\u2019s ski resorts \u2013 photo essay", "date_published": "2023-01-26 06:00:51+00:00", "description": "<p>Comparison of satellite images from start of 2023 and those from last winter shows unprecedented lack of snow</p><p>We take a look at several European ski resorts comparing the snow cover this winter at the start of the year with that of last season.
