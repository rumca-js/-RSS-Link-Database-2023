There will be &quot;no new costs&quot; for drivers, the administration says. The initiative would build on the city's plans to electrify its own fleet.</p><p>Adams didn't detail how this transition would take place. <em>The Verge</em><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/26/23573100/nyc-uber-lyft-electric-mayor-adams-2030\">notes</a> that the Taxi and Limousine Commission, which already regulates NYC ridesharing, would likely be responsible for implementing the EV strategy.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>At least some companies are already onboard with the idea. Uber &quot;applaud[s]&quot; Adams' plan, according to a statement, while Lyft says it's &quot;excited&quot; to work with the city.

They also have programs in place to encourage EV adoption across the US, such as <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/uber-rents-tesla-evs-to-drivers-131556170.html\">Uber's rentals through Hertz</a> as well as <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/lyft-ev-incentives-bundle-194254704.html\">Lyft's incentives</a>.

EVs are currently more expensive than their combustion engine counterparts, and workers may have trouble affording them even if the maintenance costs are ultimately lower. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/chevy-blazer-equinox-ev-teaser-184112130.html\">EV prices are declining</a>, but it may be a while yet before they're truly affordable to a driver base struggling to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nyc-court-blocks-uber-and-lyft-driver-pay-raise-205406394.html\">improve pay</a>.</p><p>There's also the question of infrastructure.

It would pass \u2014 if only just. In a <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4335905\">newly published</a> study, University of Minnesota law professors had ChatGPT produce answers for graduate exams at four courses in their school. The AI passed all four, but with an average grade of C+. In another <a href=\"https://mackinstitute.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Christian-Terwiesch-Chat-GTP.pdf\">recent paper</a>, Wharton School of Business professor Christian Terwiesch found that ChatGPT passed a business management exam with a B to B- grade. You wouldn't want to use the technology to impress academics, then.</p><p>The research teams found the AI to be inconsistent, to put it mildly. The University of Minnesota group noted that ChatGPT was good at addressing &quot;basic legal rules&quot; and summarizing doctrines, but floundered when trying to pinpoint issues relevant to a case. Terwiesch said the generator was &quot;amazing&quot; with simple operations management and process analysis questions, but couldn't handle advanced process questions. It even made mistakes with 6th grade-level math.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>There's room for improvement. The Minnesota professors said they didn't adapt text generation prompts to specific courses or questions, and believed students could get better results with customization. At Wharton, Terwiesch said the bot was adept at changing answers in response to human coaching. ChatGPT might not ace an exam <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cnet-corrected-41-of-its-77-ai-written-articles-201519489.html\">or essay</a> by itself, but a cheater could have the system generate rough answers and refine them.</p><p>Both camps warned that schools should limit the use of technology to prevent ChatGPT-based cheating. They also recommended altering the questions to either discourage AI use (such as focusing on analysis rather than reciting rules) or increase the challenge for those people leaning on AI. Students still need to learn &quot;fundamental skills&quot; rather than leaning on a bot for help, the University of Minnesota said.</p><p>The study groups still believed that ChatGPT could have a place in the classroom. Professors could teach pupils how to rely on AI in the workplace, or even use it to write and grade exams. The tech could ultimately save time that could be spent on the students, Terwiesch explains, such as more student meetings and new course material.</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/hive-ransomware-doj-fbi-disruption-193249866.html?src=rss", "title": "DOJ says it disrupted a major global ransomware group", "date_published": "2023-01-26 19:32:49+00:00", "description": "<p>The US Department of Justice has spent months infiltrating and disrupting the Hive ransomware group, the agency <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-department-justice-disrupts-hive-ransomware-variant\">announced</a> on Thursday.

The Cybertruck poses unique challenges, however. Its signature cold-rolled steel body is said to be extra-tough, but also requires manufacturing techniques not normally used for cars.

This precise moment, frozen between horrific brutality and a comforting embrace, captures the essence of the <em>Dead Space</em> remake. As a fan of the 2008 game, playing the new <em>Dead Space</em> is a cozy experience, even amid all the terror, death and gore. Hell, <em>because of</em> these factors. The <em>Dead Space</em> remake is big, beautiful and better than the original, while maintaining the magic that made the first game an instant classic. Turns out, great game design is timeless.</p><p>Man, EA used to make some good games. <em>Dead Space</em> came out at the height of EA\u2019s golden era, a year after the first <em>Mass Effect </em>and a month before <em>Mirror\u2019s Edge</em>, and it defined the sci-fi horror genre in a way that persists today. <em>Dead Space</em> was the game that introduced HUD-less horror environments, incorporating health and ability meters into Isaac\u2019s suit, rather than displaying static indicators over every scene. The remake uses the same immersion system, alongside a pop-up inventory that doesn\u2019t interrupt gameplay. Stores and upgrade benches are scattered around the USG Ishimura, the main ship where the nightmare unfolds, powered by credits and nodes that players find while slicing their way through the monsters onboard.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"931e4f36b63641d282e81d111d7e2159\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>In the remake, the Ishimura is a maze of twisting metal corridors and locked rooms, and it\u2019s bursting with secrets. I found myself checking every corner for glowing boxes to stomp on or shiny bits of ammo and credits, and my exploration was often richly rewarded. Never too<em>&nbsp;</em>rich, though \u2014 asset management underscores the game\u2019s tension, and Isaac is constantly at risk of running out of ammo, stasis energy, oxygen or health. He\u2019s always vulnerable in some way. In an action-horror game, this feeling is paramount.</p><p>Isaac has his classic arsenal of improvised and scavenged weapons, including the plasma cutter, disc ripper and flamethrower, but with some modern updates. The secondary mechanism on the flamethrower, for instance, deploys a wall of fire rather than an explosive orb, and it\u2019s an ultra-satisfying way to cut off encroaching hordes. Shooting the necromorphs\u2019 long limbs will always be more powerful than a headshot; stomping on mutant corpses still releases goodies (and any lingering player frustration), and the stasis ability remains a critical tool in managing enemies, temporarily freezing them in place. Kinesis is incredibly useful as well, allowing Isaac to pick up and hurl objects at any time, with unlimited duration.</p><figure><img alt=\"Isaac Clarke, the protagonist of Dead Space, aims his weapon at a necromorph that is standing, menacingly silhouetted against a harsh light on a space ship.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/db7f1510-9d1b-11ed-b6bb-d6cf35fd344a\" style=\"height: 1080; width: 1920;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">EA Motive</div></figure><p>Isaac gains new weapons and abilities at a rapid pace, and these tools flow into each other smoothly during locked-room combat scenes. Players are able to approach fights in a variety of ways and swap strategies on the fly \u2014 though <em>stasis, shoot, stomp</em> is always a valid approach. Save and refill stations are positioned generously throughout the environments, while ammo and health drops tend to appear <em>right</em> when they\u2019re needed. In general, it doesn\u2019t feel like the game mechanics are working against you \u2014 that\u2019s only the murderous mutant space monsters.</p><p>Aside from significant graphical improvements, the single biggest enhancement in the <em>Dead Space</em> remake is the addition of zero-gravity flight. This mechanic opens up the game in a way that feels authentic to the source material \u2014 as if this is what developers wanted to do back in 2008, but hardware limitations made it impossible. In the original, Isaac leapt from surface to surface in zero-gravity, but now he floats and soars freely through these scenes with boosters on the soles of his boots. While flying, he can shoot, freeze and fling objects at enemies in any direction.&nbsp;</p><p>Boss fights and large-scale puzzles are dynamic in zero-G, and flying changes some sections of the game drastically. Isaac\u2019s final fight against the Leviathan (a big tentacle blob) is now a fast-paced, no-oxygen, in-literal-space event with three turrets, requiring a combination of kinesis, mid-flight strafing and shooting skills. In the original <em>Dead Space</em>, this fight has Isaac firing on the tentacles from a gunner seat inside the Ishimura. There\u2019s no denying, the remake does it better.</p><section><img alt=\"Isaac Clarke, the protagonist of Dead Space, stands under a spotlight in a dark, dingy corner of a spaceship.\" class=\"e2ehero-url\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/b63f99e0-9d1c-11ed-99b9-8278a17d92a7\" /></section><p><em>Dead Space</em> is bloody and beautiful from start to finish on PlayStation 5. The game includes full voice acting, expanded narrative arcs, fresh mechanics, new puzzles and no loading screens (just a few suspiciously long tram rides that developers at Motive claim exist purely to <em>increase the tension</em>).&nbsp;</p><p>Only a couple of sections in my playthrough came close to tedious. More than halfway through the game, I was grabbed by a giant tentacle and had the wrong weapon equipped to shoot its glowing weak point. It took half a dozen deaths for me to properly swap guns and land enough shots to end the sequence. This felt unfair and deflating after an entertaining and challenging boss fight. However, I'm happy to say this was my largest gripe with the remaster \u2014 despite minor hiccups like this one, <em>Dead Space</em> is a master class in action-horror game design.&nbsp;</p><p>There\u2019s a surprising amount of restraint to this remake: EA updated the right things in the right way, while avoiding the baggage of modern AAA games. You\u2019ll find no procedural generation here, no open world, no way to communicate with other players, not even a HUD; just a limited set of skills and a spaceship filled with violent, half-dead, long-limbed monsters.</p><p>Playing the <em>Dead Space</em> remake feels like snuggling into a cozy sweater made out of bloody, infected flesh and razor-sharp bone fragments. It\u2019s scary, yes, but in a way that makes you laugh after jumping in fright. It\u2019s a lot like being spooked by a friend \u2014 or, maybe, getting hugged by a necromorph.</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/apple-studio-display-lowest-price-amazon-144611783.html?src=rss", "title": "Apple's Studio Display drops to a record low price at Amazon", "date_published": "2023-01-26 14:46:11+00:00", "description": "<p>If you like the thought of the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-studio-display-review-mac-monitor-154504997.html\">Apple Studio Display</a> but balk at its official price tag, the monitor might be worth a second look.

And while the amount of engineering and tech that went into the Steam Deck is certainly impressive, Valve's mission to make a portable and affordable PC for gaming on the go means there's plenty of room in the handheld space for something with a bit more giddyup \u2014  which brings us to the Ayaneo 2.</p><h2>Design: Like a Steam Deck, but fancier</h2><p>While the Ayaneo 2 doesn\u2019t deviate too much from the Steam Deck's basic blueprint, right from the get-go it's also apparent that this thing isn't some cheap knock-off either. It features a big 7-inch 1920 x 1200 LCD display with strong brightness (just under 400 nits in our testing) that's flanked by an Xbox-style controller layout. There are also handy buttons on each side for opening menus or functioning as shortcuts, along with some more customizable controls crammed in on top that by default serve as left and right mouse clicks. Even the power button has a built-in fingerprint sensor, which is a welcome bonus not available on the Steam Deck.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"a5ec800bbc3b45d39edaf77e5a7d9198\"></div><p>One of the things that impresses me the most is Ayaneo's attention to detail. The whole setup feels well-built. The PC's case is smooth and sturdy and has a very reassuring heft. In front, there's a single sheet of glass that goes across the face of the system (with cutouts for the joysticks and buttons), which gives it a slick, streamlined appearance. The company even went out of its way to ensure that there aren't any visible screws. Though if you do want to get inside, there's an included pick you can use to pry off the little covers on each side. Just be careful so you don't mess up the finish like I did.</p><p>Among other premium upgrades compared to the Steam Deck, the Ayaneo 2 sports magnetic hall sensor joysticks and shoulder triggers that feel crisp and snappy. There\u2019s basically no dead zone, unlike what you get with Valve\u2019s handheld. But my favorite thing about the Ayaneo 2\u2019s design is that its touchscreen doesn't have any bezels, and almost looks elegant.</p><p>Finally, while I don't think either machine is truly pocketable, the Ayaneo 2 is definitely the more compact of the two. The Steam Deck measures nearly a foot across (11.7-inches) versus a more manageable 10.4-inches for the Ayaneo 2.</p><h2>Ports and accessories: So many options</h2><figure><img alt=\"Unlike the Steam Deck, the Ayaneo 2 features a total of three USB-C ports, two of which can be used for charging. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/72c86220-9cfc-11ed-b57f-f754c996f639\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Another quality that elevates the Ayaneo above its rivals is a wealth of ports. Not only do you have a 3.5mm audio jack and a microSD card slot for expandable storage, you also get three USB-C ports, two of which can be used for charging. That flexibility came in handy more often than I expected, because it gave me the freedom to plug in a power cable to either the top or bottom, which makes it easier to keep the cord out of the way no matter how you're holding the system.</p><p>On top of that, while Ayaneo makes a dock for its handhelds, because there are three USB-C ports along with two USB-A adapters in the box, you don't really need to buy one at all. Even without any additional dongles or hubs, you still have enough connectivity to plug in a mouse, keyboard and an external display, so it's really easy to use this thing as a standard PC in a pinch. And if that wasn't enough, Ayaneo even includes a charging brick, a couple of international power adapters, a USB-C cable and an extra set of screw covers.</p><h2>Performance: Zen3 makes a big difference</h2><figure><img alt=\"The Ayaneo 2 features a handy QuickTool that makes it easy to adjust things like performance and fan settings, but it could use a little more quality control, as certain options like the one for resolution can be a bit hit-or-miss.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/99c687d0-9cfc-11ed-b5be-f367ee4c0445\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>The other major advantage the Ayaneo 2 holds over the Steam Deck is raw performance. While Valve worked with AMD to create a custom chip based on the company's Zen2 architecture, the Ayaneo 2 sports a newer Ryzen 7 6800U chip built on the Zen3+ platform. That's a jump in processing power that you can really feel.</p><p>In benchmarks, the Ayaneo 2 scored 4,282 on 3DMark's Wild Life Extreme test, which is comparable or slightly better than what we've seen from similarly-priced laptops like the Surface Laptop 5 (3,848) or the XPS 13 Plus (3,505). And when gaming, the Ayaneo 2 is between 25% to 40% faster than the Steam Deck depending on the title. In <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider </em>on high settings at 800p, the Ayaneo 2 averaged 54 fps versus 40 fps for the Steam Deck. And when I increased the game\u2019s resolution to take advantage of the Ayaneo 2's full HD+ screen, it still managed to pump out a playable 35 fps at 1920 x 1200 ( in <em>SotTR)</em>, despite pushing nearly twice as many pixels. It's a similar story in <em>Elden Ring</em>, where the Ayaneo 2 hovered around 55 fps in 800p at medium settings, compared to 48 fps for the Steam Deck, or at 40 fps at 1200p.</p><h2>In use: A more luxurious way to game on the go</h2><figure><img alt=\"Thanks to its Ryzen 7 6800U chip, the Ayaneo 2 can deliver strong framerates even at 1920 x 1200. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/dc8838c0-9cfc-11ed-b566-deb5ef3ea43a\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Ok ok, enough about the design and specs, what is this thing actually like to use? Well, in short, the Ayaneo 2 addresses some of my biggest complaints about the Steam Deck, but in a smaller, more compact and better-performing chassis. Its screen is way brighter, more colorful and higher-res making everything look sharper too. And thanks to its Ryzen 7 6800U CPU, you can get similar framerates with the Ayaneo 2 at 1920 x 1200 versus 800p for the Steam Deck. I should also mention that, while the Valve's portable PC tops out with just 512GB of onboard storage, the Ayaneo 2 can be specced with up to a 2TB SSD, while still having a microsD card slot (with a neat protective cover) for extra room if you want it.</p><p>The Ayaneo 2's control setup is excellent too. That's because even without built-in touchpads, like you get on the Steam Deck, you can still easily navigate Windows 11 using the left stick, which doubles as a way to move your mouse cursor. Sure, that means you're probably not going to want to play <em>Civilization 6 </em>or an RTS on the Ayaneo 2, but even with more optimized controls, those games still feel clunky on the Steam Deck. Ayaneo's magnetic hall sensors in the analog sticks and shoulder triggers also deliver an incredibly responsive experience. And while I wouldn't call it a quiet system, when its fans spin up the whir isn't nearly as loud or annoying as what I get from my Steam Deck. (Note: For what it's worth, my Deck has the slightly whinier sounding Huaying fan.)</p><figure><img alt=\"The really emphasize its streamlined design, the Ayaneo 2 has little faceplates that cover up its external screws. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/eacb4bb0-9d11-11ed-bf25-2e34470229de\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>That said, there are still more than a few awkward aspects about the Ayaneo 2. The first is that Windows 11 is kind of annoying to use with touch controls, though simply booting into Steam's Big Picture mode lets you sidestep much of that. Second, while I appreciate the included Ayaspace app, which serves as the company's consolidated game launcher and performance monitoring tool, the user experience feels a bit unpolished.</p><p>Changing the system's resolution from the AyaQuickTool window was often hit-or-miss. On top of that, when I installed an update to the AyaSpace app, its language setting reverted back to Chinese. That\u2019s not a huge pain to fix, but I'd rather be playing games than diving through menus repairing something that shouldn't have changed. Then there are other little quirks like its weak rumble motors and not knowing what makes the lights underneath the joysticks change colors. That\u2019s because aside from a couple of short quick-start manuals, Ayaneo doesn\u2019t provide much documentation for the device, so you\u2019re kind of on your own when it comes to figuring out the system\u2019s more hidden features. (There\u2019s a link to a FAQ doc in the AyaSpace app, but the whole thing is in Chinese, so it's not much help for many of us in the west.)</p><figure><img alt=\"The bottom of the Ayaneo 2 features one USB-C port, a microSD card slot (with a small protective cover) and a pair of surprisingly decent stereo speakers. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/2816abe0-9d12-11ed-bc5f-da2e0fba48b2\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Now I should note that the company says it\u2019s already working on a second version of the AyaSpace app, and in the month I've had the system, there have been multiple patches, so it's clear the company is committed to improving the situation. Still, while the Ayaneo 2's specs are top-notch, some of its software still feels like a work in progress.</p><p>However, a lot of the Ayaneo 2's weak points are made up for by the fact that it runs Windows, which means almost every game just kind of works. Don't get me wrong, I have a huge appreciation for what Valve is trying to do with SteamOS and for Linux gaming as a whole, but even with thousands of games that have been verified to run on the Steam Deck, there are thousands more that aren't (and in some cases, may never run right). With the Ayaneo 2, you simply have a lot more confidence that the next game you buy won't have issues when you boot it up.</p><p>And now let me turn things over to my colleague James, who has been testing out the Ayaneo 2\u2019s emulation capabilities.</p><h2>James' retro corner</h2><figure><img alt=\"For those who aren't a fan of the white model, the Ayaneo 2 is also available in black. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/feff1210-9d7f-11ed-b5ff-7ad26d3fca04\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">James Trew</div></figure><p>It would be decadent to recommend buying something like the Ayaneo 2 as an emulation-first device. But, it's worth talking about its performance here as it really does expand the potential library of games. Of course, if you want to rip ROMs from games you already own, you'll need to figure that side out yourself.</p><p>Obviously, with the power to run some fairly demanding PC games, the Ayaneo 2 will be more than capable of running everything up to the 5th or 6th generation of consoles without too much trouble. You'll be able to go beyond this, but with mixed results. <em>Skate 3</em> on the PS3, for example, runs on the Ayaneo 2 at 60fps with almost no special configuration.<em> The Last of Us</em>, on the other hand, was only able to muster between 13-23fps, with the odd flicker above and below that.</p><figure><img alt=\"The Ayaneo 2 has lights behind its joysticks that change colors from blue to red depending on the situation, though due to a lack of documentation, it's not always clear why.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/a0029790-9d12-11ed-bd7f-50f68c47d502\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Theoretically, you can almost come right up to the present day, with some industrious YouTubers getting Nintendo Switch games to run with varying levels of success. Of course, for now at least, this is the limit but if you had a library of old games and were hoping they might have a second life on the Ayaneo 2, the answer is that, unsurprisingly, it's a very capable emulator that benefits from built-in controls (which saves a surprising amount of meddling around).</p><h2>Battery life: Could be better</h2><p>One of the few shortcomings of the Ayaneo 2 is its battery life. That's because when compared to the Steam Deck which typically lasts three to four hours on a charge (depending on the title), the Ayaneo 2's longevity is closer to two or three. That said, you can adjust the power draw of the system if you want to improve energy efficiency, but in the end, this is the price you pay for increased performance.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><figure><img alt=\"The Ayaneo 2's much brighter, more colorful and higher-res screen is almost worth the added cost all on its own.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/78484dd0-9d12-11ed-9eeb-be3be0d65c35\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>As I look back, I still think the Steam Deck was one of the most important gadgets of 2022. Putting premium laptop specs with great controls and surprisingly good battery life in a handheld PC that starts at just $400 is an unbeatable deal. But for people who want something a bit more premium, the Ayaneo 2 has a lot to like. It's got a cleaner, more compact design with a way better screen. Its joysticks and buttons also feel tighter and more luxurious. And on the inside, it's got a significantly more powerful chip that not only delivers solid performance at FHD+, [the decision to go] with Windows instead of Steam OS also means much wider game compatibility. Unfortunately, with the cheapest version of the Ayaneo 2 starting at around $850, you're also paying a premium for all those fancy upgrades. But if you've been searching for something that is essentially a Steam Deck Pro, the Ayaneo 2 is it.</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/amazon-blink-wired-floodlight-camera-now-available-140027946.html?src=rss", "title": "Amazon's Blink Wired Floodlight Camera is now available for $100", "date_published": "2023-01-26 14:00:27+00:00", "description": "<p>One of Amazon's home security companies, Blink, unveiled its first wired floodlight camera during the e-commerce giant's fall event last year.

We will release the results and share more after it happens,&quot; he added. We may never know how the &quot;robot lawyer&quot; will fare in court, though, because a few days later, Browder announced that DoNotPay is postponing its court case after he received threats of jail time from state bar prosecutors if he goes through with his plan.&nbsp;</p><p>The CEO told <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/01/25/1151435033/a-robot-was-scheduled-to-argue-in-court-then-came-the-jail-threats\"><em>NPR</em></a> that multiple state bar associations had threatened his company, and one even said he could be imprisoned for six months. He told the media organization: &quot;Even if it wouldn't happen, the threat of criminal charges was enough to give it up. The letters have become so frequent that we thought it was just a distraction and that we should move on.&quot; While the State Bar of California refused to talk about DoNoPay's situation, it told <em>NPR</em> that it has a duty to investigate potential instances of unauthorized law practice.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Browder originally created DoNoPay as a free AI-powered chatbot that can help you draft letters and fill out forms for various legal matters. The company's &quot;robot lawyer&quot; is powered by several AI text generators, including ChatGPT and DaVinci, re-trained to know the law. A defendant using the technology in court would have worn smart glasses to record the court proceedings, as well as a headset that would give the AI a way to tell them what to say.&nbsp;</p><p>As <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ai-robot-lawyer-artificial-intelligence-do-not-pay/\"><em>CBS News</em></a> said in a previous report, though, the tech isn't legal in most courtrooms. Also, in some states, all parties must consent to being recorded. That's why of the 300 cases DoNotPay looked at, only two were viable candidates. In the end, Browder decided to put off the company's court ambitions and to focus on using AI to help people with issues related to consumer rights, specifically lowering medical bills, cancelling subscriptions and disputing credit reports, among others.</p><p><em>NPR</em> said, however, that the CEO is still hoping that artificial intelligence could eventually help people in the courtroom. &quot;The truth is, most people can't afford lawyers. This could've shifted the balance and allowed people to use tools like ChatGPT in the courtroom that maybe could've helped them win cases,&quot; he told the organization.</p><div id=\"f2813e94f07947a6a597f4101b4f55fc\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Specifically, lowering medical bills, cancelling subscriptions, disputing credit reports, among other things, with A.l.
