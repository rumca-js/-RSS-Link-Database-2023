<p>As the war continues to slowly escalate, the question remains, how does this end?</p><p>These tanks aren’t going to help end the war anytime soon. Hopefully, they are intended to build up Kiev’s negotiating position and this might encourage the Kremlin to rethink its extreme war aims, thus moving this war toward a negotiated endgame. But the Ukrainians are likely to see the decision as a Western endorsement of their aim of beating Russia definitively on the battlefield. This works against diplomacy and tends to draw the war out. </p><p>Christopher S Chivvis is a senior fellow and director of the Carnegie Endowment’s American statecraft program</p><p>Matthew Duss is a visiting scholar in the American Statecraft program at the Carnegie Endowment.
