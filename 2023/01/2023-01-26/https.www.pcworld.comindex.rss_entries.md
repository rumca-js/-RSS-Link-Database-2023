<p>Yesterday&rsquo;s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-Et8r1413Y&amp;xcust=2-1-1485054-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Developer Direct presentation</a> was a bit of a staid affair. Another <em>Minecraft </em>spinoff, another <em>Forza</em>, another <em>Elder Scrolls Online</em> expansion, and another preview for vampire shooter <em>Redfall</em>. But there was one standout. <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> is a pop-rock breath of fresh air, a rhythm-based beat-em-up with all the color and attitude of a post-<em>Pokemon </em>kid&rsquo;s anime. And you can play it&hellip;right now, on PC and Xbox. And it&rsquo;s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/hi-fi-rush/9nftc552k3gj&amp;xcust=2-1-1485054-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">launching immediately on Xbox Game Pass</a>. Huh. </p>

</div></figure>



<p><em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> comes from Tango Gameworks, a Japanese studio best known for <em>The Evil Within</em> and <em>Ghotswire: Tokyo</em>. The studio&rsquo;s horror pedigree is deep, with <em>Resident Evil</em> director Shinji Mikami serving as studio founder and, yes, producer for this game. But if you&rsquo;re expecting anything dark or frightening from <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, you&rsquo;re in for something far more shocking than a zombie hiding in a locker. It&rsquo;s is a frenetic beat-em-up in every sense of the word, where you smash cel-shaded robots and bounce around a cartoon world to the rhythm of a power rock soundtrack. </p>



<h2 id="a-beat-em-up-in-every-sense">A beat-em-up in every sense</h2>



<p>You play Chai, a protagonist who fell right out of a 2000s-era Fox Kids show. This aspiring rockstar has had his arm replaced with a cybernetic trash collector after volunteering for experimental surgery at one of those giant, cartoonishly evil companies that seem to populate the Borderlands universe. When the surgery <em>also </em>implants his off-brand iPad into his chest, Chai gains the power to see the pulse of the world around him, wield a Flying V made out of trash a la Quick-Draw McGraw, and power up his attacks by smashing on the beat. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>You can button-mash all you want, but Chai will only strike his foes on the beat</p></blockquote></figure>



<p><em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> alternates between basic platforming sections, populated with a bunch of moving platforms and predictably breakable crates, and boxed-off combat arenas filled with robots for you to musically pummel. The latter is where the gameplay shines, giving you a wide selection of tools to wreak rhythmic destruction. You can button-mash all you want, but Chai will only actually strike his foes on the beat: either one beat for the light attack or two for the heavy. You can move, jump, dash, and grapple to your enemies with a little more freedom, but the attack restriction means that most of the gameplay is locked into the beat of the background music. You&rsquo;ll gain points by striking in time, but won&rsquo;t lose anything if you miss it &mdash; you&rsquo;ll just do less damage and gain fewer style points than you might have. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Hi-Fi Rush: &quot;BOOM&quot; combat" class="wp-image-1485270" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/BOOM-Hi-Fi-rush.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Bethesda Softworks</p></div>



<p>It&rsquo;s a combat system that&rsquo;s both stylish and forgiving, at least on the default difficulty level. It&rsquo;s hard to mess things up too badly even in the over-the-top boss fights. That&rsquo;s especially true once you unlock combo attacks with your Scooby gang of support characters, who can break through shields or soften up impenetrable armor when temporarily summoned. Super attacks and combos make the screen burst into even more vibrant life &mdash; and justify the game&rsquo;s seizure warning. </p>



<h2 id="platforming-sections-slow-to-a-crawl">Platforming sections slow to a crawl</h2>



<p>If only the basic enemies had as much variety as your arsenal of attacks. In the first three or four hours of gameplay, I exclusively fought remixed robots in closed-off boxes, with no environmental hazards or arena variation. The bosses offer a bit of a change of pace (literally, since they get remixed versions of licensed songs from bands like Nine Inch Nails and The Black Keys), but also display a depressing lack of imagination. The first big boss is &mdash; stop me if you&rsquo;ve heard this one before &mdash; a giant robot that smashes you with its fists, at which point it shows a weak point for you to wail on. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Hi-Fi rush giant robot boss 2" class="wp-image-1485263" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Hi-Fi-rush-giant-robot-boss-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Bethesda Softworks</p></div>



<p>The platforming sections in between combat are likewise uninspired. You&rsquo;ll bounce and zip around a 3D world that looks gorgeous, but plays like a licensed Pixar game from the PlayStation 2. Every new ability unlock effectively boils down to &ldquo;press button to continue,&rdquo; and the jumping physics (which propels you forward at a walking pace and not a bit faster) make actual traversal a chore. </p>



<h2 id="whats-the-difference-presentation">What&rsquo;s the difference? Presentation! </h2>



<p>That might sound like I&rsquo;m not having fun with<em> Hi-Fi Rush</em>. But I am. Despite the easy combat and the iffy platforming, the game is just bursting with so much personality and <em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy2zB8bLSpk&amp;xcust=2-1-1485054-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">prrrrrr</a><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy2zB8bLSpk&amp;xcust=2-1-1485054-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">rresentation</a></em> that I can&rsquo;t help but smile while playing it. The primary colors of the characters and environments constantly punch your eyeballs in a refreshing change from the cyan-and-pink color pallet indie gaming seems to have been stuck on for the last few years. It&rsquo;s enabled and artfully enhanced by cel-shading that makes the whole game look like a cartoon. </p>



<p>And the animation. Good grief. Absolutely everything in <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> bounces to the beat of the music, from the enemies to the backgrounds to Chai and his robot cat-slash-Bluetooth speaker. It has that same kind of visual heartbeat as <em>Cuphead</em>, but with design from a modern cartoon instead of a hundred-year-old Fleischer short. He stomps his trainers to the beat while running around the environments, and taps and snaps his fingers (with an Adam West Batman-style &ldquo;SNAP&rdquo; onomatopoeia appearing) even while at rest. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>It has that same kind of visual heartbeat as <em>Cuphead</em></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>The visuals and music combine for a pop-punk feeling of joy that&rsquo;s impossible to deny, even if the gameplay itself isn&rsquo;t innovative. If you don&rsquo;t find yourself bobbing your head in time to the music after a level or two, you might have to look out for Old Man Trouble. The quippy dialogue is also a bit flat &mdash; again, like <em>Borderlands</em> without the swearing &mdash; but the voice acting is competent enough that it doesn&rsquo;t get grating. </p>



<h2 id="thank-goodness-its-on-game-pass">Thank goodness it&rsquo;s on Game Pass</h2>



<p>Hi-Fi Rush is <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1817230/HiFi_RUSH/&amp;xcust=2-1-1485054-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">$30 on Steam</a> and the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/hi-fi-rush&amp;xcust=2-1-1485054-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a>. And based on the first three hours, I&rsquo;d hesitate to recommend it at that price, unless you&rsquo;re a big fan of either kid&rsquo;s anime or rhythm games. But publisher Bethesda is now firmly in Microsoft&rsquo;s family (at least <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-lawsuit-could-reportedly-attempt-to-delay-bethesdas-microsoft-sale/&amp;xcust=2-1-1485054-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">if the courts don&rsquo;t force a breakup</a>), so the game has instantly landed on Xbox Game Pass. As a freebie for subscribers, or even a reason to spend $10-15 on a one-month ticket to the library, it&rsquo;s more than justified. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Hi-Fi rush: robot cat" class="wp-image-1485330" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/hifi-rush-cat.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Bethesda Softworks</p></div>



<p>I should also point out that the game runs great, much more so than you might expect from a title that launches on PC and Xbox at the same time. It animates smooth as butter on my RTX 3070 desktop, and supports my ultrawide monitor&rsquo;s 21:9 resolution without complaint. After playing several iffy cross-platform releases &mdash; looking at you, <em>Elden Ring </em>&mdash; it&rsquo;s a nice change of pace. </p>



<p><em>Hi-Fi Rush </em>might not be breaking new ground in any area, but its presentation and personality are so appealing that I find it hard to care. Give it a try if you have Game Pass, or bookmark it for the next time you re-up your subscription. </p>

## Here’s how to fix your NAS if Windows 10 or 11 broke its functionality

<p>Network-attached storage is great until it isn&rsquo;t. When access to your files suddenly goes down, the fixes sometimes can be time-consuming, especially when related to a failed disk.</p>



<p>Fortunately, that&rsquo;s not necessarily the case if you&rsquo;ve <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1448683/windows-8-1-support-ends-january-10-secure-your-pc.html">just moved from Windows 8.1</a> (or older) to a newer version of Windows. If you&rsquo;re encountering an error when trying to access your NAS over your home network, a file-sharing protocol issue is likely the problem. Some older NAS units use <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/file-server/troubleshoot/detect-enable-and-disable-smbv1-v2-v3?tabs=server&amp;xcust=2-3-1473155-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Server Message Block v1.0</a> as their network file sharing protocol&mdash;but Microsoft eventually <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/file-server/troubleshoot/smbv1-not-installed-by-default-in-windows&amp;xcust=2-3-1473155-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">disabled it by default for security reasons</a> in Windows 10. The policy also carried over to Windows 11.</p>



<p>You can get around this incompatibility in a few ways, depending on your NAS&rsquo; manufacturer. The most ideal option is applying a software update that enables support for SMB v2 or higher, but not all vendors added this support. If that&rsquo;s the case, you can try enabling NFS, an alternative protocol, in both your NAS&rsquo; management interface and in Windows.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage center"><figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img alt="The &quot;Turn Windows features on or off&quot; options window" class="wp-image-1473156" height="616" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/windowsfeaturesonoff.png" width="413" /><figcaption>To enable SMB v1 in Windows 10 or 11, open the Start Menu or the search menu, then type &ldquo;windows features&rdquo; and choose <em>Turn Windows features on or off</em>.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>If neither of these solutions work, as a last-ditch option, you can turn SMB v1 support back on&mdash;but you&rsquo;ll also introduce your PC to notable security risks. (You can read more about them in this clear and impassioned <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/storage-at-microsoft/stop-using-smb1/ba-p/425858&amp;xcust=2-3-1473155-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">explanation of those risks</a> from a Microsoft employee.) SMB v1 is old and weak enough against threats in Windows 11, Microsoft is in the process of removing the support all together. If you <em>really</em> want SMB v1, you&rsquo;ll have to seek out and install the files manually.</p>



<p>Should you find yourself in a position where only SMB v1 will work and are a security-minded person, unfortunately, your best solution is going to be upgrading your NAS and investing time into that data migration. But hopefully you&rsquo;re not in this boat and can instead focus your energy on <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/702039/10-tiny-windows-tips-to-power-up-your-pc.html">nifty things you can do</a> in your new version of Windows.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been waiting for Microsoft&rsquo;s DirectStorage&mdash;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398899/microsoft-xbox-series-xs-directstorage-velocity-architecture-windows.html">the backbone of the Xbox Series X&rsquo;s ultra-fast storage technology</a>&mdash;to come to Windows for <em>years</em> now. After being <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/623036/microsoft-releases-directstorage-the-future-of-fast-loading-pc-games.html">released to developers last spring</a>, it&rsquo;s finally here, sinking its deep optimized-storage hooks into Square Enix&rsquo;s <em>Forspoken</em>, which released this week to middling reviews&hellip;and no review copies for PC reviewers. Ominous. So is the lightning-fast load-free future of PC gaming finally here?</p>



<p>Definitely maybe? <em>Forspoken </em>indeed sports some damned impressive loading times, but it&rsquo;s unclear how much of a difference DirectStorage itself makes in this game if you already have a fast NVMe SSD. <strong>Update: </strong>It also appears that DirectStorage can lower your overall frame rate by roughly 10 percent in <em>Forspoken</em>, at least in the configuration tested. Read that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1485079/microsoft-directstorage-slashes-the-rtx-4090s-speed-by-10-in-forspoken.html">separate report here</a>.</p>



<p>First, the good news. As spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.neowin.net/news/nvme-demand-could-shoot-up-as-microsoft-directstorage-in-forspoken-is-seen-working-its-magic/&amp;xcust=2-1-1484183-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Neowin</a>, several users report achieving blisteringly fast load times on the PC. (Since PC review copies weren&rsquo;t provided, user reports are key in these early days.) Twitter user <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/BlooHook/status/1617940784875175937&amp;xcust=2-1-1484183-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">BlooHook</a> loaded all of <em>Forspoken</em>&rsquo;s benchmark scenes in under two seconds, as measured by the game. Impressive!</p>

It&rsquo;s <em>cool</em>!</p>



<p>But there are questions about whether those are the result of DirectStorage, or if <em>Forspoken</em> simply has ultra-fast loading times to begin with. On the r/hardware subreddit, user <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/10kipjx/comment/j5sprfa/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3&amp;xcust=2-1-1484183-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">skipan</a> noticed that the game only loads instantly when you&rsquo;re continuing from the most recent save. &ldquo;It seems they are &lsquo;cheating&rsquo; by preloading the most recent save file in the start screen,&rdquo; skipan said. &ldquo;I get instant load on the most recent one and a loading screen on older ones. Thats actually useful for the player experience but for benchmarking you should load an older save.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Skipan helpfully uploaded the following YouTube video showing the difference in load times after saving at the exact same spot twice, seen below:</p>

<p>As far as BlooHook&rsquo;s two-second load times go, our own Adam Patrick Murray was playing around with the <em>Forspoken </em>benchmark last night and reports he saw similar results on a system with a fast NVMe drive&mdash;but he&rsquo;s running Windows 10. Microsoft says DirectStorage will run on both Windows 10 and 11, with ostensible optimizations in the newer OS, but Square Enix says <em>Forspoken</em>&rsquo;s DirectStorage support only applies to Windows 11.</p>



<p>Finally, we have one reviewer report, and it paints a less rosy picture. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://wccftech.com/forspoken-pc-benchmark-test-checking-out-frame-rate-and-load-times-for-the-first-directstorage-game/&amp;xcust=2-1-1484183-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Wccftech</a> benchmarked <em>Forspoken</em>&rsquo;s loading times on an advanced gaming rig (Intel Core i7-12700KF, 16GB of DDR4 RAM, GeForce RTX 4090, WD Black SN850 NVMe SSD) and encountered good, but not stellar results. Several scenes loaded in under two seconds, but the longest took 7.5 and 9.5 seconds.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The average load time (not provided by the benchmark, so we calculated it manually) is 4.30 seconds, which is not what we hoped from DirectStorage compared to the one-second loads available on PS5,&rdquo; the site reports.</p>



<p>Square Enix&rsquo;s Sunil Godhania took to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/1680880/discussions/0/3766732716817835011/&amp;xcust=2-1-1484183-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">the Steam forums</a> yesterday to say that &ldquo;By running a NVMe SSD drive, loading time may finish within 1~2 seconds. With SATA SSD it may take about 10 seconds,&rdquo; though he did note that the &ldquo;loading time may vary depending on other hardware configurations and the storage devices in use.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So what&rsquo;s really going on here? Is DirectStorage supercharging NVMe load times on Windows 10 and 11 alike despite Square Enix&rsquo;s claim of Windows 11 exclusivity? Is the game just so well-optimized that it loads lightning-quick on Windows 10 even without official DirectStorage support? How much do your PC&rsquo;s specs matter? That Wccftech rig certainly is ferocious.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ll need to investigate deeper and see DirectStorage implemented in more games to know for sure, especially as other PC users report that the game is <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.pcgamer.com/forspokens-pc-port-is-another-fine-square-enix-mess/&amp;xcust=2-1-1484183-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">a bit of a technical mess</a>. (There&rsquo;s a <em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1680880/Forspoken/&amp;xcust=2-1-1484183-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Forspoken</a></em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1680880/Forspoken/&amp;xcust=2-1-1484183-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow"> demo available</a> if you want to try it yourself.) A couple things seem clear, however. First, <em>Forspoken </em>has damned impressive load times no matter what, especially when resuming from your last save, and we want to see more of that regardless of the cause. And second, no matter what&rsquo;s going on with DirectStorage here, PC gamers <em>definitely</em> want to be gaming on an NVMe SSD rather than a SATA drive these days if at all possible.

<p>Samsung recently announced the launch of the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://videocardz.com/press-release/samsung-unveils-odyssey-neo-g7-43-its-first-4k-144hz-quantum-mini-led-gaming-monitor&amp;xcust=2-1-1485006-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Odyssey Neo G7</a>, which is a flat mini-LED gaming monitor. If you&rsquo;re wondering what all the hullaballoo is about, listen up. Mini-LED monitors are a fantastic choice for gaming because there&rsquo;s hardly any burn-in issues, the image quality is simply superb, and their eye-searing brightness can&rsquo;t be matched. However, they tend to be very expensive and hard to find. </p>



<p>That might be changing soon, though. Not only does the Odyssey Neo G7 tout a crystal clear 4K resolution, but there&rsquo;s also a plethora of cool smart features that really personalize the whole experience. Let&rsquo;s dive in.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Further reading: </strong><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/560224/oled-vs-mini-led-the-pc-displays-of-the-future-compared.html">OLED vs. Mini-LED: The PC displays of the future, compared</a></p></blockquote>



<p>The 43-inch Odyssey Neo G7 has a resolution of 3840&times;2160, a maximum refresh rate of 144Hz, and a response time of 1ms. It has AMD FreeSync Premium Pro support, which helps reduce stuttering and input latency. Although we haven&rsquo;t gotten our hands on this model yet, given the specs, we suspect this monitor will deliver nothing but a lovely picture and buttery smooth visuals. This could be a fantastic monitor for competitive gamers in which every second matters. The smart features are cool, too. </p>



<p>The smart features are cool, too. According to manufacturer, the Samsung Gaming Hub2 is an &ldquo;all-in-one game streaming discovery platform that allows instant access to games from partners such as <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/810011/xbox-cloud-gaming-review.html">Xbox</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/630335/geforce-now-review.html">Nvidia GeForce Now</a>, with no downloads or storage space requirements.&rdquo; That sounds pretty rad. You can also gain access to smart TV apps like Prime Video, Netflix, and more. </p>



<p>The Odyssey Neo G7 will become available to purchase in the first quarter of 2023 and seems like it has a pretty good shot on cracking our roundup of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/811315/best-monitors-2.html">the best monitors available</a>. No word on pricing yet, though.</p>

## Microsoft DirectStorage slashes the RTX 4090’s speed by 10%

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s long-awaited (perhaps-revolutionary) <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1484183/microsofts-lightning-fast-directstorage-tech-finally-arrives-on-pc-with-perplexing-results.html">DirectStorage technology finally arrived on the PC</a> this week in <em>Forspoken</em>. Initial testing reports showed encouraging yet mildly perplexing results, with some sections of the game loading in under two seconds flat and continues from your last save point being virtually instantaneous. Yes please! But it appears there&rsquo;s a tradeoff: Your in-game frame rates decrease by about 10 percent.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s what the team at Germany&rsquo;s PC Games Hardware discovered while putting the <em>Forspoken </em>benchmark through its paces at 4K resolution. The publication used a set testing rig consisting of a Core i9-12900K and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html">Nvidia&rsquo;s ferocious GeForce RTX 4090</a>, then ran the benchmark from a PCIe 3.0 NVMe SSD, a PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD, and finally a SATA SSD. The SATA SSD doesn&rsquo;t support DirectStorage, which requires an NVMe drive.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>The end result? The SATA drive delivered the highest average frame rate to the tune of 83.2 frames-per-second. The NVMe drives each averaged roughly 75 fps, a significant 9.64 percent speed reduction. On the positive side, the 1 percent and 0.2 percent frame rates remained consistent across all three drives, so DirectStorage didn&rsquo;t affect <em>Forspoken</em>&rsquo;s moment-to-moment smoothness.</p>



<p>One of DirectStorage&rsquo;s key features is decompressing game assets on your graphics card rather than your processor, so it makes sense that overall performance is impacted in some way. Still, a 10 percent frame rate reduction is eye opening. That&rsquo;s roughly comparable to the jump between an RTX 3080 and 3090, though in real-world terms, the difference between the SATA setup and the NVMe setups were just 8 frames-per-second.</p>

<p>These results aren&rsquo;t necessarily universal, however. The RTX 4090 is by <em>far</em> the most powerful graphics card on the market and PC Games Hardware only tested at 4K resolution. Performance scaling could change at lower resolutions or on different GPUs with different architectures and memory configurations. (Square Enix did not send out PC review copies, only PlayStation 5 codes, so PC publications are still scrambling to test the new technology.)</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s also a bit of an open question if <em>Forspoken</em> is an appropriate champion for Microsoft&rsquo;s ultra-fast new storage tech. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/forspoken-ps5-vs-pc/&amp;xcust=2-1-1485079-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Reviewers</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.pcgamer.com/forspokens-pc-port-is-another-fine-square-enix-mess/&amp;xcust=2-1-1485079-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">users</a> agree that the game is a technical mess on the PC. With no other DirectStorage games to compare results to, who knows if it&rsquo;s working to its fullest abilities here?</p>



<p>One thing seems clear, though. There ain&rsquo;t no such thing as a free lunch. DirectStorage may drastically reduce loading times under the right circumstances, but offloading that work to the GPU has consequences elsewhere. It&rsquo;ll take a lot more testing (and games with DirectStorage support) to fully wrap our heads around everything Microsoft&rsquo;s forward-looking storage technology has to offer.

## Mad genius creates IDE-powered 2.5-inch SSD

<p>A compact car that runs on a coal boiler. A cell phone that only allows you to text via Morse code. And a modern, multi-terabyte 2.5-inch SSD that connects to a motherboard with an IDE interface. What do all these things have in common? They&rsquo;re perfectly plausible technology combinations that you&rsquo;d need to be a little crazy to actually build. But the last one is now a reality, at least a theoretical one.</p>



<p>For those of our readers who might not be able to buy their own alcohol yet: IDE stands for Integrated Drive Electronics. Also known as Parallel-ATA, it&rsquo;s a 40-pin connector we used to connect hard drives and disc drives to motherboards before SATA (Serial-ATA) came along. If you were building or upgrading PCs from around 1990 to 2005, you know the wide, floppy ribbon of an IDE cable well: it made desktop case cable routing a headache. </p>



<p>Github user &ldquo;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://github.com/dosdude1/2.5-inch-ide-ssd&amp;xcust=2-1-1484999-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">DosDude1</a>&rdquo; (spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.tomshardware.com/news/enthusiast-builds-diy-25-inch-ide-ssd-for-retro-pcs&amp;xcust=2-1-1484999-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Tom&rsquo;s Hardware</a>) remembers IDE fondly. Or perhaps they don&rsquo;t, and they&rsquo;ve designed an IDE interface for a modern storage controller out of pure necessity. Either way, if you have a Silicon Motion SM2236 controller, a bunch of NAND flash storage modules, and a bit of soldering and programming skill, you can create your own 2.5-inch SSD that connects with an IDE-equipped motherboard. </p>



<p>The speed of your flash storage (up to 2 TB of it, if you max out the four 512GB connections) will vastly bottleneck the IDE connection, which tops out at 133 megabits per second. That&rsquo;s about one-fifth the speed of a modern SATA III connection, which is also about the same difference between SATA III and a speedy NVMe M.2 drive (3.5 Gbps). But hey, if you absolutely need to run<em> Red Alert II </em>on period-accurate hardware, aside from insanely fast storage, here&rsquo;s your chance. </p>

<p>Specialized Windows Hello biometric webcams that both log you in to your computer and make you look great on video calls are undeniably useful work-at-home accessories. And now, in 2023, they&rsquo;re much easier to find. </p>



<p>Why buy a Windows Hello webcam? A <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393756/1080p-webcam-buying-guide.html">top 1080p webcam</a> helps you look your best in video calls in Microsoft Teams or Zoom. But Microsoft&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2953512/hands-on-with-windows-10s-windows-hello-it-just-works.html">secure-login Windows Hello system </a>uses facial recognition technology to log in Windows 10 or Windows 11 in a split second without the need to enter a password every time you log on to your PC. It makes sense people would want to pair a&nbsp;desktop PC or laptop&nbsp;with a Windows Hello-compatible webcam in order to get its convenient security benefits.</p>



<p>Windows Hello webcams from Dell and Logitech top our list, but the good news is that there are Windows Hello webcams available for well under $100. Most include premium features such as 1080p resolution, making them a top choice for a new PC webcam.</p>



<p>Below, we&rsquo;ve listed several Windows Hello webcams that we recommend, though we&rsquo;ve trimmed several that simply don&rsquo;t live up to what our preferred webcams offer.  Want more information? We&rsquo;ve included a buying guide and a FAQ after our best Windows Hello webcam picks. You can also review our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393756/1080p-webcam-buying-guide.html">1080p webcam buyer&rsquo;s guide</a> for recommendations of webcams without Windows Hello support.</p>

<p>Logitech&rsquo;s Brio is often the default choice for a solid Windows Hello webcam. It still ranks highly among premium webcams, primarily because it&rsquo;s one of the few autofocusing webcams that captures in 4K resolution. Windows Hello comes along for the ride. The Brio includes a ton of features to make you look great, and its Windows Hello support will log you in in a snap. The MSRP is $199.99, but you can often find it for much less (hurray, competition!). That is, when this popular camera isn&rsquo;t sold out.</p>

<p>For many, Logitech&rsquo;s Brio 4K Ultra HD will be overkill. But a legion of devoted fans also consider it to be the gold standard for PC webcams, with or without Windows Hello.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It offers a ton of features:&nbsp;HDR, auto-focusing, digital zoom (up to 5X), framing, brightness, saturation, and more. Unusually, the WB7022 is neither fixed-focus, nor does it offer a fixed field of view (FOV). Dell&rsquo;s AI framing crops the image to keep your face centered, and you have the option of configuring the field of view from 90 degrees, 78 degrees, and down to a narrow 65 degrees. Dell applies HDR, temporal, and spatial noise reduction to help you look your best.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no mic (Dell uses your laptop instead) and a magnetic privacy shutter that clips on. See our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3622908/dell-ultrasharp-4k-webcam-price-specs-features.html">story on&nbsp;Dell&rsquo;s WB7022</a>.</p>

<p>Honestly, many of you will probably buy this Windows Hello webcam and simply not miss the more expensive alternatives. About the only feature you may miss in this 1080p, 30fps webcam is autofocus capability, and most fixed-focus webcams are tuned for the average distance (in the HelloCam&rsquo;s case, between 12.4 and 47.2 inches) that someone sits from their laptop or display.  The field of view is a relatively narrow 90 degrees.</p>

<p>This webcam ships with both noise-cancelling mics as well as auto-exposure capabilities, which should leave you looking and sounding professional on your next Zoom call or Teams meeting. There&rsquo;s a privacy cover, too, for when this webcam is not in use. Interestingly, the privacy shutter is software-controlled, but the lens cover is orange &mdash; in other words, it should be obvious when your camera can and can&rsquo;t see you. NexiGo does require its utility software to be installed.</p>

<p>You may consider the USB-A to USB-C cable a bit finicky and short, but that&rsquo;s a small knock on an otherwise solid value. The cable can also be replaced.</p>

<p>Elecom is a Japanese brand, and this Amazon-stocked webcam is relatively bare-bones &mdash; but it&rsquo;s clearly the lowest-priced Windows Hello webcam on the list. Surprisingly, it offers 1080p functionality, but don&rsquo;t be surprised if the image quality is a bit less than expected. Still, for under $50 this is a great deal for those who want to secure their PC with Windows Hello.</p>

<p>The Elecom webcam is a 1080p, fixed-focus, 80-degree wide angle webcam, recording at 30fps. The single mic includes echo and noise reduction. The cable length of the included cable is just four inches or so, so you may need to swap it out with a longer option. The included webcam cover also covers the IR sensor, too, so you&rsquo;ll need to uncover it every time you use it.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-look-for-in-a-windows-hello-webcam">What to look for in a Windows Hello webcam</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/422745/hands-on-with-windows-10s-windows-hello-it-just-works.html">Windows Hello dates back to 2015</a>, and the introduction of Windows 10 running on Microsoft&rsquo;s Surface hardware. It replaces the need to type your password to log in every time you sit down at your desk, providing a speedy yet secure compromise to secure your PC.</p>



<p>Typically, Windows Hello is associated with depth-camera technology, which recognizes the various contours of your face, identifying you and only you.  (A normal webcam doesn&rsquo;t understand that it&rsquo;s looking at a 3D image.) The image is then compared with a reference image which is stored during setup. The process itself is fast: It takes just a second or two for a Windows Hello webcam to recognize you, verify your identity to the PC it&rsquo;s connected to via a USB cable, and log you in. Windows Hello can also read your fingerprint with a separate Windows Hello fingerprint reader, but these webcams are all you need.</p>



<p><strong>1080p:</strong> The resolution of the webcam matters. Most laptops still ship with 720p webcams, and a higher-resolution webcam will make you look better than your colleagues.</p>



<p><strong>Fixed-focus versus autofocus:</strong> A worthwhile but not critical feature, autofocus will keep you in focus if you move back and forth, walk around the room, or so on. Fixed-focus webcams usually work just fine for normal use.</p>



<p><strong>Auto-exposure:</strong> Most webcams will adjust their exposure for the available lighting, but superior webcams will do so in a way that makes you look well-lit and not a webcam zombie.</p>



<p><strong>Noise cancellation:</strong> Running a fan in the background? Are the neighbors mowing their lawn or blowing their leaves away? A good noise-cancelling webcam with a mic will filter out these background noises.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>The webcam, a USB cable to connect it to your PC, and a desktop or laptop with Windows 10 or Windows 11 are all you need. We&rsquo;ve never seen a webcam that uses a proprietary USB cable, so you can always spend a few dollars and buy a longer one if for some reason if it&rsquo;s too short.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>After buying a webcam, make sure you have a Windows 10 or Windows 11 PC. Connect the webcam to the PC via the USB cable and that should be all you need for basic webcam functionality. (Some webcams require you to install their utility software to function, however.) In the Windows 10 or Windows 11 Settings menu, search for &ldquo;Set up face sign-in.&rdquo;  Then click the &ldquo;Facial recognition (Windows Hello)&rdquo; menu.</p>



<p>When that screen appears, you&rsquo;ll need to add a PIN or password as a backup. Be sure that your PC is using your webcam (though it should by default). Windows Hello setup requires simply looking at the screen while the webcam looks at you and records your image.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>In general, yes. You shouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about a rebellious teen holding up a photo they snapped of your face and logging in. Just be sure to secure your PC by logging out or setting a timeout function if you get up from your PC and walk away. </p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>That can happen, over time. A beard (or lack of one), new glasses, a big hat, or something else that obscures your face can interfere with Windows Hello. You can always go to (on Windows 11) <em>Settings&gt; Accounts &gt; Sign-in options</em> and &ldquo;improve recognition&rdquo; &mdash; the phrase Windows uses for updating what you look like to your PC.</p>

## I bought a pre-built desktop gaming PC and I’m not sorry about it

<p>OK, so, hear me out. I purchased a pre-built gaming desktop tower instead of building a PC from scratch and I don&rsquo;t regret it one bit. Certain PC building enthusiasts will balk at my decision, but the entire process from purchasing the desktop to setting it up in my home office was incredibly easy. I had just moved into a new house at the time, and the convenience of a pre-built tower was just too good to pass up. </p>



<p>When you&rsquo;re living out of boxes and everything is out of order, the last thing you want to do is deal with a bunch of loose hardware parts. If you&rsquo;re still not convinced, hold onto your seats. I&rsquo;m still going to convert you! <em>Cue villainous laughter&hellip;</em></p>



<h2 id="pre-built-gaming-pcs-are-relatively-affordable-and-easy-to-set-up">Pre-built gaming PCs are (relatively) affordable and easy to set up</h2>



<p>Buying a PC is serious business. Building one from the ground up is even more serious. Although there&rsquo;s a bunch of useful how-to guides available on the Internet, there&rsquo;s a lot that can go wrong. You could accidentally warp the pins on your CPU, or you could assemble the parts incorrectly. Personally, I&rsquo;m not willing to take the risk. I enjoy tinkering with hardware to a certain extent, but I&rsquo;m not entirely confident in my assembly skills and I&rsquo;m fine with that. I&rsquo;d rather leave it to professionals.</p>



<p>Pre-built gaming towers offer peace of mind. The parts inside these PCs have been assembled and tested by professional builders. I purchased a pre-built rig from <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://nzxt.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1481326-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">NXZT</a> and it was quick to ship. It also worked beautifully the moment I turned it on. Aside from plugging in my peripherals and moving my files over, I didn&rsquo;t have to do much else. Pre-built prices aren&rsquo;t too bad, either.</p>



<p>I ended up getting the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://nzxt.com/product/starter-pro&amp;xcust=2-1-1481326-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">NZXT Starter PC Pro</a>, which was $1,149. The Starter PC series comes in three configurations, with the lowest tier model costing $949. Those prices are reasonable, especially for starter machines. NXZT&rsquo;s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://nzxt.com/collection/streaming&amp;xcust=2-1-1481326-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Streaming Series</a> line of PCs are much more powerful and heavier on the wallet. </p>



<h2 id="pre-built-pc-warranties-and-service-support-are-worth-it">Pre-built PC warranties and service support are worth it</h2>



<p>When it comes to pre-built PCs, you&rsquo;re paying for the warranty and service support as well as the hardware. NXZT includes a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://nzxt.com/legal/warranty&amp;xcust=2-1-1481326-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">warranty period</a> of two years, which begins the day you receive your machine. It covers any defects with labor or components. So, if you wind up with a wonky machine, NXZT will repair, replace, or refund at their discretion. </p>



<p>As for service support, I was pleased with the live chat function and found that my questions were answered in a timely and thorough manner. My PC works just fine, so I never had to reach out by phone, but I did find the Frequently Asked Questions page to be extremely helpful. The company also offers free lifetime technical support. </p>



<h2 id="why-i-chose-nzxt">Why I chose NZXT</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Ashley's NZXT desktop tower" class="wp-image-1483999" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Untitled-design-13.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Ashley Biancuzzo</p></div>



<p>When I was browsing for a prebuilt desktop tower, I knew I wanted a rig that could handle games like <em>Final Fantasy XIV Online, Phasmaphobia, and Warhammer: Vermintide 2.</em> In terms of graphics power, those aren&rsquo;t the most demanding games in the world, but I play all three on a regular basis and I&rsquo;m more of a casual gamer anyway. Like I mentioned earlier, I purchased the Starter PC Pro model, which is the highest tier configuration in this particular series. </p>



<p>The Starter PC Pro comes equipped with an Intel Core i5-11400F CPU, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of NVMe SSD storage. That&rsquo;s more than enough power for my needs, which include casual gaming and productivity work. I decided to go with a NZXT machine after having read a handful of positive reviews. Plus, the website is clean and super easy to navigate. Trust me, you don&rsquo;t want to be in a state of confusion when you&rsquo;re trying to pick out a gaming PC. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>I purchased a pre-built gaming desktop tower instead of building one from scratch and I don&rsquo;t regret it one bit</p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 id="ok-but-what-are-the-downsides-or-pre-builts">OK, but what are the downsides or pre-builts?</h2>



<p>Pre-built machines aren&rsquo;t the easiest to upgrade. Unfortunately, with NXZT&rsquo;s Starter PC series, you can&rsquo;t mix and match the components, either. You get what you get and you don&rsquo;t get upset (or maybe you do). Building your own machine can be cheaper in the long run, which is super rad&hellip; as long as you know what you&rsquo;re doing. If you&rsquo;ve never assembled a PC before, better to play it safe, as mistakes will cost you hundreds of dollars down the road.</p>



<h2 id="so-do-you-go-for-it">So, do you go for it?</h2>



<p>Hell yeah, you go for it! If you&rsquo;re short on time and don&rsquo;t feel confident enough in your assembly skills, a pre-configured machine is the way to go. The plug-and-play aspect is awesome and they&rsquo;re generally more affordable up front. I absolutely adore my pre-built rig and wouldn&rsquo;t trade it for anything. That said, buying a pre-built means you&rsquo;re stuck with limited configurations. At the end of the day, there&rsquo;s no <em>wrong </em>decision here. It really boils down to your lifestyle and comfort level. Happy gaming, folks.</p>

<p>In the grand scheme of potential privacy concerns, email privacy is perhaps the most personal.</p>



<p>Getting unwanted messages in your inbox can feel like a major breach of trust, and knowing senders can see a record of everything you&rsquo;ve opened and clicked can feel downright creepy.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s worth getting familiar with all the ways you can protect your email privacy. From resistance against email tracking to masked email addresses that hide your identity, here are some of my favorite free tools you can use right now:</p>



<h4 id="ironvest-for-all-purpose-email-masking">Ironvest for all-purpose email masking</h4>



<p>Masked email is a way to hide your email address without having to maintain a separate email account for junk. Instead of handing out your actual email address, you can provide an alias that forwards to your regular inbox.</p>



<p>This approach is perfect for retail sites that offer coupons in exchange for your email address, political campaigns that never leave you alone after donating, and any other site you don&rsquo;t fully trust to treat your inbox with respect. It can also help you get extra free trials from services that require a unique email address.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Ironvest masked emails" class="wp-image-1477178" height="418" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ironvest2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>My masked email tool of choice is <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://ironvest.com/personal&amp;xcust=2-1-1477176-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Ironvest</a> (formerly known as Abine Blur), as it lets you set up an unlimited number of aliases for free from any web browser or mobile device. The sender only sees the masked email (which looks like &ldquo;<a href="mailto:gx2bhfw3155w@opayq.com">gx2bhfw3155w@opayq.com</a>&ldquo;), and you can disable or delete these addresses on Ironvest&rsquo;s website. Doing so prevents the sender from ever being able to contact you again.</p>



<p>One caveat: Ironvest&rsquo;s browser extension for&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blur/epanfjkfahimkgomnigadpkobaefekcd?hl=en&amp;xcust=2-1-1477176-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Chrome</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/donottrackplus/&amp;xcust=2-1-1477176-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Firefox</a>&nbsp;is great for generating masked addresses directly inside web sign-up forms, but it also includes a lot of superfluous features. After installing it, click on the extension, then click <em>Settings &gt; Settings for All Sites</em> and disable what you don&rsquo;t need. (I only use it for masked email, and rely on other extensions like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1339204/why-i-switched-to-bitwarden-for-my-password-manager.html">Bitwarden</a>&nbsp;for passwords and&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://ublockorigin.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1477176-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">uBlock Origin</a>&nbsp;for ad blocking.)</p>



<h4 id="anonaddy-for-on-the-fly-email-addresses">Anonaddy for on-the-fly email addresses</h4>



<p>While Ironvest is a valuable resource, it&rsquo;s not perfect. Generating new email addresses is a pain on phones, where you have to the company&rsquo;s mobile app, and the service is of little help when someone asks for your email address out in the real world.</p>



<p>For those situations, I&rsquo;ve started turning to&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://anonaddy.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1477176-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Anonaddy</a>&nbsp;instead. Just like Abine Blur, it can generate masked email addresses that forward to your real address, but it also lets you make up new addresses on the spot without an app or extension.</p>



<p>Let&rsquo;s say you sign up for Anonaddy with the username &ldquo;joeshmoe.&rdquo; If you&rsquo;re out shoe shopping and the store asks for an email address in exchange for a coupon, you can use an address like &ldquo;shoes@joeshmoe.anonaddy.com.&rdquo; Or, if you wanted a free trial to Starz that didn&rsquo;t use your regular email, you could sign up with &ldquo;starz@joeshmoe.anonaddy.com.&rdquo;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Anonaddy masked emails" class="wp-image-1477179" height="178" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/anonaddy.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Anonaddy</p></div>



<p>Crucially, you don&rsquo;t have to set these addresses up in advance. Instead, Anonaddy will forward mail from any address that ends with &ldquo;@joeshmoe.anonaddy.com,&rdquo; so you can invent new masked addresses on the fly with practically no effort&mdash;even offline.</p>



<p>The downside to this approach is that anyone who knows your nickname could also generate new email addresses on your behalf, and the only way to stop them would be to delete your account and set up a new one. For that reason, I&rsquo;d only use Anonaddy with businesses that are unlikely to scrutinize individual addresses.</p>



<h4 id="stopping-email-snooping">Stopping email snooping</h4>



<p>With marketing emails, newsletters, and even some individual email apps, it&rsquo;s possible for the sender to track whether you&rsquo;ve opened their messages. This can sometimes lead to more unwanted email and targeted advertising, and it&rsquo;s also just unnerving to know that someone can look over your personal reading habits.</p>



<p>In my experience,&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://trockerapp.github.io/&amp;xcust=2-1-1477176-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Trocker</a>&nbsp;is the best anti-tracking browser extension for Gmail, Outlook.com, and Yahoo Mail. It works consistently and is regularly updated by the developer, plus its code is open source.</p>



<p>Gmail users might also consider&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://simpl.fyi/&amp;xcust=2-1-1477176-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Simplify Gmail</a>, an extension that provides a suite of enhancements for Gmail&rsquo;s desktop site, including tracker blocking. It does, however, require a $24 per year subscription. If you&rsquo;re using Apple Mail on MacOS,&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://apparition47.github.io/MailTrackerBlocker/&amp;xcust=2-1-1477176-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">MailTrackerBlocker</a>&nbsp;offers the same level of protection, as it uses Simplify&rsquo;s open-source block list.</p>



<p>Just be aware of the limitations with these blockers: None of them work on mobile, so you won&rsquo;t get tracking protection while reading email on your phone. Some third-party mail apps such as&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.twobird.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1477176-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Twobird</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://mail.edison.tech/&amp;xcust=2-1-1477176-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Edison</a>&nbsp;have tracker blocking built in, but otherwise the only workaround is to&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://jarednewman.com/sendy/w/WD4bLNlO2zevWYsbDbLY892w/tRmzmhWmUerL5et995r892AA/892LLWWxf8FoX4KwhUhWOx892A&amp;xcust=2-1-1477176-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">turn off images in email by default</a>.</p>



<p>Also, none of these methods will prevent senders from&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.fastcompany.com/90657377/apple-and-duckduckgo-email-privacy-link-tracking&amp;xcust=2-1-1477176-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">tracking which links you click on</a>. The best you can do to prevent this kind of tracking is hover or long-press on a link and look for signs of tracking in the address&mdash;it&rsquo;ll usually include a jumble of random characters&mdash;and avoid clicking if you don&rsquo;t trust the source.</p>



<h4 id="what-about-duckduckgo-and-apple">What about DuckDuckGo and Apple?</h4>



<p>The idea of email privacy is catching on, as larger companies offer their own tools to limit data collection by senders.</p>



<p>Apple, for instance, now registers emails as opened if you enable Mail Privacy Protection in iOS or MacOS, essentially leaving senders with useless data. It also offers a masked email service, called&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.imore.com/how-use-hide-my-email-iphone-and-ipad&amp;xcust=2-1-1477176-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Hide My Mail</a>, that will be included with all paid iCloud storage plans.</p>



<p>DuckDuckGo offers similar combo in its&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://duckduckgo.com/app&amp;xcust=2-1-1477176-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">mobile apps and browser extension</a>. With <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://duckduckgo.com/email/&amp;xcust=2-1-1477176-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">DuckDuckGo Email Protection</a>, you get a permanent duck.com email address that forwards messages to your real address, stripping out trackers along the way. You can also create masked duck.com emails so that the sender never learns your true address.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="DuckDuckGo Email Protection " class="wp-image-1477181" height="827" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/duckduckgotracking.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>Both solutions have their downsides, though. Apple&rsquo;s anti-tracking tool requires you to use its own Mail app, and its masked email service requires an Apple device to manage.</p>



<p>Similarly, DuckDuckGo&rsquo;s mobile app and browser extension require you to use the company&rsquo;s search engine. If you&rsquo;d rather use another search engine such as Google or Brave, DuckDuckGo&rsquo;s email features may be more trouble than they&rsquo;re worth.</p>



<p>Good thing there are plenty of alternatives you can use instead.</p>
