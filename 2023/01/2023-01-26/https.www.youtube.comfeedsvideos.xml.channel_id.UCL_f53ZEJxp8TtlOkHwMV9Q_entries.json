They go in-depth on the state of China\u2019s totalitarian regime, Vladimir Putin's plans for the war with Ukraine, the growing unrest under Iran\u2019s iron fist, the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine, and how a push for American optimism is necessary to best face these emboldened challengers on the world stage.\n\nWalter Russell Mead is a writer, professor, and academic, focusing his efforts on international policy and affairs. He is the James Clarke Chace Professor of Foreign Affairs and Humanities at Bard College and taught American foreign policy at Yale University. Mead has worked as a columnist for publications such as The Wall Street Journal and was editor at large for The American Interest. His books include \u201cMortal Splendor,\u201d \u201cSpecial Providence,\u201d \u201cPower, Terror, Peace and War,\u201d \u201cGod and Gold,\u201d and most recently \u201cThe Arc of a Covenant.\u201d\n\nDr Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh\n\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nHallow: \u200b\u200bTry Hallow for 3 months FREE: https://hallow.com/jordan\n\nShopify: Get a $1/ month FREE trial with full access to Shopify's entire suite of features: https://shopify.com/jbp\n\n\n- Links -\n\nFor Walter Russel Mead:\n\nThe Arc of a Covenant (Book): https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/112763/the-arc-of-a-covenant-by-walter-russell-mead/ \n\nWalter Russell Mead on the Washington Post: https://www.wsj.com/news/author/walter-russell-mead \n\nHudson Institute: https://www.hudson.org/experts/1038-walter-russell-mead \n\n\n- Chapters -\n\n(0:00) Coming up\n(1:20) Intro\n(2:48) A basic framework of world politics\n(6:10) China, wealth without morality\n(9:35) Challenging Anglo-American dominance \n(11:15) Crazy 80 percent of the time\n(15:30) China is falling behind\n(19:00) Biden, messaging, and Taiwan\n(20:25) Xi Jinping, another Mao\n(24:00) Tightening uniformity of power\n(26:45) Losing faith in Chinese manufacturing\n(31:25) Economic liberalization, political dark age\n(33:30) Marxism: capitalism is exploitation\n(36:00) Admiration of inequality\n(39:00) Vladimir Putin is not a Communist\n(44:30) Intrinsic worth and quasi-fascism\n(47:00) Ukraine, goal of the war\n(51:35) Normalcy in war, changing landscapes\n(55:30) The nature of Iran\u2019s current regime\n(1:00:00) Iran and Israel, the Persian Gulf\n(1:02:30) Circumventing Palestine\n(1:06:55) Mark Twain, God-forsaken land\n(1:09:00) The Palestinian claim\n(1:13:20) When the facts are open to question\n(1:14:40) Christian Evangelism and the Zionist movement\n(1:16:35) Demographics of modern Israel\n(1:20:15) Stalin and Jewish independence\n(1:24:19) Netanyahu: goals and outcomes\n(1:27:14) Defense budgets, technology, and arms races\n(1:29:25) The Tower of Babel, Globalism vs. Localism\n(1:31:18) The Abraham Accords\n(1:33:00) Oil profits will not last\n(1:35:55) Democrats and Saudi Arabia\n(1:41:20) Why America is soft on Iran\n(1:43:48) The reason for optimism\n\n\n\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}], "source": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q", "title": "Jordan B Peterson"}}
