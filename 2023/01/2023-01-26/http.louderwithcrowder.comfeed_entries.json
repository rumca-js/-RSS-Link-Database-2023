This time, it's over \"book-banning.\" </p><p>Florida is requiring all curriculum and reading material to be vetted according to standards set by the Florida Department of Education. This will inevitably lead to the exclusion of some books deemed inappropriate. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/don-lemon-reparations\" target=\"_blank\">Don Lemon</a> was beside himself at this news. He told Poppy Harlow, \"It feels like the 1950s all over again, with book banning.

This is outrageous ... it's just ridiculous.\"</p><p>Lemon went on to say that \"this isn't about a [parent's] voice in education\" and called that argument a \"red herring\" because there are lots of uncomfortable topics in school books, like Nazism. Poppy decried that teachers can be charged with a third-degree felony if they violate the law </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cCNN's @DonLemon on Florida: \"It feels like the 1950s all over again, with book banning.

Surely, Don Lemon's extreme distress must mean Florida is trying to prevent kids from reading about crucial parts of history, like Hitler or slavery...right? </p><p>Oh no. It bans pornography. </p><p>The Florida education standards <a href=\"https://www.kplctv.com/2023/01/26/book-ban-underway-teachers-fear-prosecution/\" target=\"_blank\">require</a> lesson materials to be \u201cfree of pornography and material prohibited under state statute, suited to student needs and their ability to comprehend the material presented, appropriate for the grade level and age group for which the materials are used and made available.\u201d</p><p>So...the kids are still learning about Hitler, still learning about slavery, and African American history...just no porn. Seems reasonable to me. But I have some questions for Don.  </p><p>What's even more disturbing is, some Florida schools are so worried about violating this law, they've shut down all classroom libraries and covered the totally-porn-free books with paper. I have some questions for those schools, as well. </p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!

I still recall look of awkwardness on her face because it was inappropriate to discuss personal political views with students. Even when asked a simple question about current events.</p><p>1992 is a bygone era. As is 2021, where teachers at least had the sense not to advertise their indoctrination on social media. Now it's 2023 and teachers believe it's their right to exploit your five-year-old by pushing their political agenda on them instead of teaching things like sight words. The teachers and their allies act as if they're NOT the ones who are assholes in this situation.

Perhaps New Yorkers love abortion Medusa watching over their every moment. </p><p>The statue is called \"NOW\" because, according to Sikander, it was needed...now.

That drama queen claims <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kevin-mccarthy-reporter\" target=\"_blank\">Speaker Kevin McCarthy</a> is <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/eric-swalwell-blasts-kevin-mccarthy\" target=\"_blank\">trying to get them killed</a> by *checks notes* saying they aren't grown-up enough to handle vital intelligence. Schiff is more of a basic b*tch whining on social media. Bored with Twitter, he joined TikTok.</p><p>Correct. A guy whining he was kicked off of the House INTELLIGENCE committee signed up for TIKTOK, owned by...you know.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">WATCH: Congressman Adam Schiff posts a TikTok video after being removed from the House Intelligence Committee <a href=\"https://t.co/Dw4CjBwqxY\">pic.twitter.com/Dw4CjBwqxY</a><br />\u2014 Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DailyCaller/status/1618408468771409920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 26, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Set aside the usual summary where Rep.

And how he lied claiming he saw the intelligence that proved Russian collusion, even though he was told it didn't prove Russian collusion. I know that you know all that.</p><p>To whine about no longer receiving US Intelligence, he signs up for an app...OWNED BY COMMUNIST CHINA. <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tiktok-joe-rogan\" target=\"_blank\">THAT SENDS ALL HIS PERSONAL DATA TO COMMUNIST CHINA</a>.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"a55c3\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32907665&amp;width=980\" />\n</p>\n<p>State and federal governments are banning TikTok from being used on government-issued phones over the whole \"communist China\" thing. Colleges are banning it over the whole \"communist China\" thing as well. Yet Adam Schitt, who used to be CHAIRMAN of the House INTELLIGENCE Committee, signed up for TikTok to whine about no longer receiving intelligence. He could have used Instagram or Snapchat. He went with the app guaranteed to send all his data to Chinese commies.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"c16f5\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32907683&amp;width=980\" />\n</p>\n<p>I know, at least to a degree, McCarthy kicked Schitt off as revenge for Nancy Pelosi kicking republicans off of committees for bitterly partisan reasons. Don't get me wrong, I'd be cool if revenge was the only reason for yeeting democrats. But maybe the reason Rep. Schitt doesn't get to see any more Intelligence is due to his overwhelming lack of intelligence.</p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!

I do this as a service to YOU, the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website reader. You know when you see Britney Spears trending you're going to be curious. Instead of scrolling through \"why is Britney Spears trending?\" tweets and TikToks of that God-awful song she did with <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-elton-john\" target=\"_blank\">Elton John</a>, let me save you the trouble. Britney is trending because her stans called the cops on her.</p><p>She deleted her Instagram account and they were concerned. So they called LAPD to do a welfare check. And livestreamed it.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">These are the \u201cfans\u201d that called the cops on Britney because she deleted her Instagram account.. y\u2019all know what to do! <a href=\"https://t.co/aBGVyiA8Dk\">pic.twitter.com/aBGVyiA8Dk</a><br />\u2014 KingSpears (@godkneebitch) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/godkneebitch/status/1618299971199201280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 25, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>According <a href=\"https://www.tmz.com/2023/01/26/britney-spears-911-call-welfare-check-annoyed-fans-delete-instagram/\" target=\"_blank\">to TMZ</a>, Spears was left \u201cannoyed\u201d after the unexpected visit. She understands how deeply her fans care about her and her well-being and wasn\u2019t totes surprised fans got the cops involved. Still, it was an inconvenience. </p><p>These stans weren't the only ones who called the cops because they were worried and couldn't even. It also wasn't the only recent Britney drama. She was out for dinner with husband Sam Asghari, who walked out when the singer looked, quote, \"manic.\" Also, prior to deleting her Instagram, she announced on the app she was changing her name to River Red.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"56a1a\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32907567&amp;width=980\" />\n</p>\n<p>Drama has been following Britney all over for the past few years. She lashed out when she discovered <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/britney-spears-catholic-church\" target=\"_blank\">she had to be Catholic to get married in a Catholic church</a>. Haters called her racist when she accused Kevin Federline of <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/britney-spears-racist\" target=\"_blank\">smoking too much weed just like all those rappers</a>. Then there was that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears_conservatorship_dispute\" target=\"_blank\">whole conservatorship with her father thing</a>, which I never understood and don't care to learn about now.</p><p>If nothing else, Britney still has obsessed fans who care about her. Obsessed fans who, in 2023, are still obsessed with her for some reason. I'd understand it more if they were obsessed over Taylor Swift or Cardi B., both of whom are still happening. But to each their own.</p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!
