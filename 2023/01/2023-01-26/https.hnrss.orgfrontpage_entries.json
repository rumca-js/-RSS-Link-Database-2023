I was tired of dragging boxes around on a canvas. You may have seen knotend around here before when I wrote an initial blog post [1] about why I wanted a new kind of flowchart editor. Thank you to everyone who has given me feedback here on HN!<p>Since that blog post I\u2019ve been working hard to get to a v1 which I\u2019m showing now. You can use the free version without having to sign up for an account. I would love your feedback!<p>What makes knotend different is two main things: 1) The nodes are constrained to a grid which enables a keyboard-centric experience for selection and navigation, and 2) there\u2019s autolayout so each time you add a node, the graph automatically lays itself out and places each node in a cell.<p>In the future I\u2019ll be working on supporting more complex editing actions, linking graphs together, collaboration, and more.<p>Please drop your feedback below, reach out on twitter [2], or email scott@knotend.com.<p>[0] <a href=\"https://www.knotend.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.knotend.com</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https://www.scottantipa.com/why-knotend\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.scottantipa.com/why-knotend</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ScottyAntipa\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://twitter.com/ScottyAntipa</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34533218\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34533218</a></p>\n<p>Points: 17</p>\n<p># Comments: 6</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34532983", "title": "Tell HN: IBM and SAP are cutting thousands of jobs", "date_published": "2023-01-26 15:35:04+00:00", "description": "<p>IBM (IBM) announced the cuts Wednesday, saying they were related to the previously announced spinoff and sale of two business units.

The restructuring will cost between \u20ac250 million ($272 million) and \u20ac300 million ($381 million); the company\u2019s shares were down 3.3% in Frankfurt.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34532983\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34532983</a></p>\n<p>Points: 45</p>\n<p># Comments: 11</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-cause-of-depression-is-probably-not-what-you-think-20230126/", "title": "The cause of depression is probably not what you think", "date_published": "2023-01-26 15:31:55+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-cause-of-depression-is-probably-not-what-you-think-20230126/\">https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-cause-of-depression-is-probably-not-what-you-think-20230126/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34532927\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34532927</a></p>\n<p>Points: 66</p>\n<p># Comments: 75</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-01-25/ibm-layoff-3900-workers-still-hiring", "title": "IBM to cut about 3,900 workers while still hiring in \u2018higher growth\u2019 areas", "date_published": "2023-01-26 15:01:00+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-01-25/ibm-layoff-3900-workers-still-hiring\">https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-01-25/ibm-layoff-3900-workers-still-hiring</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34532437\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34532437</a></p>\n<p>Points: 24</p>\n<p># Comments: 4</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://katedowninglaw.com/2023/01/26/an-ip-attorneys-reading-of-the-stable-diffusion-class-action-lawsuit/", "title": "An IP Attorney\u2019s Reading of the Stable Diffusion Class Action Lawsuit", "date_published": "2023-01-26 14:57:33+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://katedowninglaw.com/2023/01/26/an-ip-attorneys-reading-of-the-stable-diffusion-class-action-lawsuit/\">https://katedowninglaw.com/2023/01/26/an-ip-attorneys-reading-of-the-stable-diffusion-class-action-lawsuit/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34532378\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34532378</a></p>\n<p>Points: 11</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://quitesimple.org/page/fun-gentoo-shuffle-rop-gadgets", "title": "Fun with Gentoo: Why don't we just shuffle those ROP gadgets away?", "date_published": "2023-01-26 14:57:02+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://quitesimple.org/page/fun-gentoo-shuffle-rop-gadgets\">https://quitesimple.org/page/fun-gentoo-shuffle-rop-gadgets</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34532373\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34532373</a></p>\n<p>Points: 6</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://nsidc.org/learn/ask-scientist/how-thick-is-sea-ice", "title": "How thick is sea ice and how do we know?", "date_published": "2023-01-26 14:56:17+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://nsidc.org/learn/ask-scientist/how-thick-is-sea-ice\">https://nsidc.org/learn/ask-scientist/how-thick-is-sea-ice</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34532358\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34532358</a></p>\n<p>Points: 4</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34532295", "title": "Tell HN: Confluent laying off 8% of staff", "date_published": "2023-01-26 14:51:31+00:00", "description": "<p>It hasn't been posted publicly but staff recieved an email from the CEO this morning announcing that 8% of staff have been cut in a \"restructuring\".

We're starting with a tool to catch UI bugs in web applications with zero-effort from developers.<p>How it works: Insert a single line of JavaScript onto your site, and we record thousands of real user sessions. We then replay these sessions on head and base commits of PRs, take screenshots at key points, and diff those screenshots to catch visual regressions before they hit production. We employ novel techniques to eliminate flakes. You can watch a 60-second demo at [meticulous.ai](<a href=\"http://meticulous.ai/\">http://meticulous.ai/</a>).<p>We are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor, Palantir and Google, and have previously led 100+ engineer organizations at these companies. We just raised $4m, and are backed by some of the best founders and technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub), Scott Belsky (CPO Adobe), Calvin French-Owen (founder Segment), Jared Friedman (YC partner and former CTO of Scribd) and a bunch of other incredible folks.<p>Catching visual regressions is just the start. There is an entire category of products to build on top of replay. This ranges from catching exceptions to revealing the performance impact of frontend code.<p>We want to change the way the world develops software, and influence software approaches for decades to come.<p>We are seeding a London office and hiring an onsite (few days per week) founding engineer to join our team of four.<p>You will have autonomy in building out this technology, but here are a few problems you might work on:<p>- Build a distributed system to concurrently replay thousands of sessions, such that a developer gets a result in seconds.<p>- Speed up the replay of sessions in a way that retains determinism.<p>- Derive algorithms to detect sessions that cover differing code paths and edge cases, and ignore sessions that are too similar.<p>- Help build out a team of world-class, highly collaborative, software engineers.<p>As founding engineer, you get to shape the company, and build the culture and technology from the ground up.<p>What we look for:<p>In a sentence: Technically brilliant, delightful to work with, combined with a self-awareness and strong desire to improve. We also want to make sure everyone is highly supportive of each other; we win as a team.<p>We're currently only looking to bring on folks with senior level skill sets and 5+ years of industry experience. You should have strong web fundamentals and a deep love for software engineering. Maybe you enjoy programming books like Clean Code, Designing Data Intensive Applications, Pragmatic Programmer etc. or enjoy hacking on interesting side projects. You value transparency and candid feedback, and are motivated by a strong desire to become the best engineer you can be.<p>You can read about our values here <a href=\"https://sumptuous-lungfish-609.notion.site/Meticulous-values-ab2b90d3324447d58f0720481081c9a6\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://sumptuous-lungfish-609.notion.site/Meticulous-values...</a><p>You will be given the space and time to up-level yourself as an engineer in terms of conferences, reading, or whatever you think will be most valuable. We will also set you up with mentorship, if you desire it, from top engineering leaders (folks running 100-engineer organizations at the world's leading tech companies).<p>You\u2019ll get to work alongside some of the best engineers there are, break new ground solving truly novel CS problems and deliver something that transforms how software is built.<p>If this sounds interesting, please reach out to me at gabe [at] meticulous [dot] ai with \u201cHN\u201d in the subject line and 2-3 sentences about what you find interesting about Meticulous and your resume/LinkedIn/GitHub.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34530631\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34530631</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://dariusforoux.com/blogging-not-dying/", "title": "Blogging is not dying anytime soon", "date_published": "2023-01-26 10:45:26+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://dariusforoux.com/blogging-not-dying/\">https://dariusforoux.com/blogging-not-dying/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34530103\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34530103</a></p>\n<p>Points: 31</p>\n<p># Comments: 11</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://apps.web.maine.gov/online/aeviewer/ME/40/766753f1-f9c7-4dc5-9a5c-fe0f3ff51c06.shtml", "title": "PayPal Data Breach Notification", "date_published": "2023-01-26 10:40:26+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://apps.web.maine.gov/online/aeviewer/ME/40/766753f1-f9c7-4dc5-9a5c-fe0f3ff51c06.shtml\">https://apps.web.maine.gov/online/aeviewer/ME/40/766753f1-f9c7-4dc5-9a5c-fe0f3ff51c06.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34530067\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34530067</a></p>\n<p>Points: 37</p>\n<p># Comments: 10</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34530052", "title": "Ask HN: What would be your stack if you are building an MVP today?", "date_published": "2023-01-26 10:37:49+00:00", "description": "<p>Specifically the backend.
