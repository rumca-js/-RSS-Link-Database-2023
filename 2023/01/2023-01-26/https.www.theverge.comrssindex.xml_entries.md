The updated program promises that more Ford owners nationwide can get access to complimentary pickup and delivery of their vehicles, as well as mobile repair options.</p>
<p id="xHC5hB">Mobile services from Ford won’t operate from a central location, though. It will still be up to dealerships to offer remote services and to choose what services to provide at a customer’s home or business. Ford is, however, lending dealers a hand to get the services up and running. “We’ve been working with multiple teams at Ford to offer our customers more ways to personalize vehicle service,” stated Ford National Dealer Council...</p>

<p id="4IEF76">The change was minor — Twitter hadn’t suddenly switched to a serif font or anything like that. But a quick Twitter search showed that I wasn’t the only one who <a href="https://twitter.com/webster/status/1618592685304209408">noticed the shift</a>, and my co-workers did, too.</p>
<p id="DdOS8L">It’s unclear why Twitter changed the font, and the company didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. (It has dissolved its press office, so I’m not expecting one.) And the company hasn’t posted anything on <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport">@TwitterSupport</a>, where it’s shared a lot of recent product updates. </p>
<p id="1k5IoN">However, some have speculated that Twitter changed the font to make it easier to spot impersonators. Molly White, the author of <a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/">Web3...</a></p>

Tom might have ruined the Roy sibling’s plans for a calculated takeover of the family business, but in the first trailer for <em>Succession</em>’s quickly approaching upcoming fourth season, it’s clear that the fight’s far from over.</p>

  <p id="Ktg0BE">Uber Eats is introducing a feature that will tell you how much of your personal information a courier has access to throughout the delivery process. The feature, called “View as Delivery Person,” is meant to “provide consumers with additional transparency and peace of mind,” especially after potentially awkward or uncomfortable encounters, according to Zach Singleton, Uber’s head of privacy and equity product.</p>
<p id="NMIyS4">The idea is that the Uber Eats app will show you what information a delivery person has about you before they pick your food up, while they’re making the delivery, and afterward. The basic gist, according to Singleton, is that they’ll only have an approximate delivery location until they actually pick up your order. In most cases,...</p>

FaceTime <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gear/how-to-use-facetimes-magic-eye-contact-feature-in-ios">can do it</a>. Microsoft Teams <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/5/23011228/microsoft-windows-11-eye-contact-automatic-framing-background-blur">can do it</a>.

<p id="obaP9J">This tech comes with a bunch of interesting questions, of course. Like: is constant unbroken eye contact good or a bit creepy? Are these tools useful for people who don’t naturally like eye contact?

But I can’t think of many that are as calm and soothing as biking around the end times in <em>Season: A Letter to the Future</em>.

It makes the apocalypse almost <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/27/23523251/cozy-games-animal-crossing-stardew-world-of-warcraft-dragonflight">cozy</a>.</p>

  <p id="Hc3XMV">Smartphone shipments have dropped nearly 20 percent year-over-year during the recent holiday period, as consumer demand softens amid inflation and economic uncertainties.  It’s the “largest-ever decline in a single quarter,” <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS50146623">according to IDC</a>, and it contributed to 2022 having the lowest annual shipment of smartphones since 2013.</p>
<p id="soEO7B">While there were still 1.21 billion smartphones shipped in 2022, shipments during the all-important holiday quarter were actually down from the previous quarter for the first time ever. “We have never seen shipments in the holiday quarter come in lower than the previous quarter,” says Nabila Popal, research director at IDC. “However, weakened demand and high inventory caused vendors to cut back drastically on...</p>

  <p id="BKolsg">Tesla’s long-anticipated Cybertruck won’t be seeing full volume production until 2024, Elon Musk said during the company’s fourth quarter earnings call today.</p>
<p id="j45Km3">During the call, Musk was asked whether the forthcoming vehicle would meet <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/20/23272045/tesla-cybertruck-delivery-middle-next-year-q2-earnings">a mid-2023 production target</a> that was set in Q2 last year. Musk cagily confirmed that Cybertruck manufacturing would start “sometime this summer,” but concluded that mass production of the polarizing pickup won’t start until next year. “I always try to downplay the start of production,” Musk said. “It increases exponentially, but it is very slow at first.”</p>
<p id="VxL3yn">Cybertruck was originally <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20975475/tesla-cybertruck-announcement-musk-electric-truck-pickup-features-range-price-release-date">announced in 2019</a> to widespread interest, but has seen its production delayed several times.
