<p>In the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dead-space/">Dead Space</a> remake, we're still no closer to figuring out what exactly <strong>Peng treasure</strong> is, but you'll want to find it like before to earn yourself not just 30,000 credits, but also the "There's Always Peng!" Achievement / Trophy. The Peng treasure isn't located in the same spot where you can find it in the original 2008 game, so even if you already think you know where it is, you may come up empty-handed. Here's where to find the Peng treasure in the Dead Space remake. </p><p><strong>This guide contains some story spoilers</strong>.</p><h2>Dead Space remake - Peng treasure location</h2><p>The Peng treasure can be found in Chapter 11 of Dead Space. That might sound familiar, as that's the chapter in which you would've found it in the original game, too. However, this time it's in a different place, so don't quit reading just yet. </p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-space-remake-where-is-the-peng-treasure/1100-6510917/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Twelve games are leaving PlayStation Plus Extra in February, including Metro: Exodus and Saints Row The Third Remastered.</p><p>Metro: Exodus presents an open world spin on the bleak, post-apocalyptic first-person shooter. Saints Row The Third Remastered revisits the absurd crime epic. Other notable titles leaving include puzzler The Turing Test, open world crime classic Grand Theft Auto: Vice City - Definitive Edition, and eerie adventure Whispering Willows. If you want to check out any of games leaving, you'll have to do it before the beginning of next month, or February 21, depending on the specific title.</p><p>The basic tier of PlayStation Plus, Essential, lets players access online multiplayer, download free games every month, exclusive discounts, and cloud storage. This month's free games are Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, Fallout 76, and Axiom Verge 2. Extra is the middle tier of PlayStation's revamped online service, which allows players to access a set of downloadable titles. This month, PS Plus Extra added Life Is Strange and its prequel, Before The Storm, as well as Back 4 Blood and Devil May Cry 5: Special Edition. The highest tier, Premium, lets players download and play retro titles, stream PS3 games, as well as all the features of the lower tiers.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-twelve-games-leaving-playstation-plus-extra-in-february-2023/1100-6510916/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## New Report Claims Valve's Structure And Work Culture Is Hostile To Diversity

<p>A new report alleges Valve leadership blocked internal diversity efforts and halted the company from making a statement on Black Lives Matter. Interviews with current and former employees elaborate on Valve's famously unconventional structure and how that structure can prevent diverse hires and outright political stances.</p><p>YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9aCwCKgkLo">People Make Games</a> interviewed 16 current and former employees of Valve, trying to get to the bottom of the gaming giant's opaque worker culture and decision-making. The video then explores Valve's worker culture and its effect on the diversity of the company. On paper, Valve has a structureless system, without literal bosses or managers and one in which employees can make their own decisions. Valve also uses its own stack-ranking system, by which employees evaluate each other's performance and, in an undisclosed way, shape the year's salary and bonus for each employee.</p><div>          </div><p>Multiple interviewees claimed the company has a lack of diversity, even by the standards of the often homogeneous games industry. One former worker claimed that more contractors and lower-level employees were women and/or people of color. She said, "While I was there, there was never more than one female programmer at the company." More women work in HR and finance, but also are locked into more defined roles and so cannot experience the workplace freedom that Valve touts.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-report-claims-valves-structure-and-work-culture-is-hostile-to-diversity/1100-6510857/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Ubisoft is reportedly working on two Far Cry games. One will be a single-player experience, while the other will be a multiplayer-based game.</p><p dir="ltr">This is according to an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sources-far-cry-7-and-far-cry-multiplayer-in-development-at-ubisoft/">Insider Gaming</a> report that claims the unannounced Far Cry game was originally meant to be one game until Dan Hay, the former franchise executive director for Far Cry, left Ubisoft to work at Blizzard Entertainment. The report goes on to say that the single-player project is now being referred to as Project Blackbird, and the multiplayer Far Cry is being called Project Maverick, with Ubisoft Montreal being heavily involved in both games.</p><p dir="ltr">Although not much is known, the report suggests that Project Maverick will be set in the Alaskan wilderness and is set to be an extraction-based looter-shooter.

## Destiny 2 Lightfall Could Connect Some Dots About The Vex

<p>Guardians and allies in the Solar System are gearing up for the inevitable return of The Witness and dealing with Cabal Shadow Legion forces in Destiny 2's upcoming Lightfall expansion. Recently, players have worked to revive the massively powerful Rasputin AI Warmind, an action that has even intrigued the Vex. We've also begun to learn more about how the Vex are not the hivemind we believed them to be--the radio message of Osiris telling Elsie about the Aberrant Vex moving away from the consensus revealed how Vex factions don't share ideals or goals. We've known the Vex to be combative and experimental Radiolarian-filled robotic species, and Elsie describes in <a href="https://www.ishtar-collective.net/records/clovis-brays-logbook-missing-pages">Clovis Bray's Logbook lore</a> that the "indifferent and curious" Vex will try to reshape the universe in every way they can, but there's more to it.</p><p dir="ltr">Based on the radio message, the Vex featured in the Neomuna Environment trailer, and what looks like the Vex network Nexus reminiscent of Season of the Splicer, it's clear the Vex will continue to be key in the upcoming story. GameSpot asked narrative designer Liz Baker and senior narrative designer Nikko Stevens during a group interview if the forthcoming story will highlight different Vex motives.</p><p dir="ltr">"The Vex are something we've talked about a lot, especially between you and I, Nikko, with Spire of the Watcher tower," Baker said. "There's a lot of interesting stuff with the Vex and their somewhat enigmatic goals." Adding, "I don't think you're wrong to sense that what's in the trailer is going to come up in the story."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lightfall-could-connect-some-dots-about-the-vex/1100-6510907/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dead-space/">Dead Space</a> has been made whole once again. In fact, in the form of the Dead Space remake, it's arguably more than whole, with EA Motive bringing to life the game's classic atmosphere while adding new side missions, voice work for the lead character Isaac Clarke, and more. Naturally, that leaves players wondering how long it takes to best the Dead Space remake, as the answer is not likely what it was way back in 2008. Here's what you need to know about the campaign, chapter list, and side missions.</p><h2>How long is Dead Space remake?</h2><p>Dead Space (2023) retells the classic story from 2008 in a way that is largely faithful. Therefore, if you were only to stay on the critical path, the campaign would take you approximately 12-15 hours. The story is split into 12 chapters, just as it was before, though several optional side missions are introduced, which will extend playtime for completionists or curious players.</p><p>It's also worth noting that there is a New Game Plus mode that unlocks after you've hit the end credits at least once. For players who want to see the game from every angle, Impossible difficulty, which disables saving of any kind and restarts from the beginning on death, will take longer, with something more like 15-20 carefully treaded hours seeming more realistic.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-long-to-beat-dead-space-remake-chapter-list-and-new-side-missions-explained/1100-6510912/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is projected to earn $120 million over its four-day opening weekend in the US. This would be the largest opening for the franchise so far.</p><p>This projection comes from a <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/01/ant-man-the-wasp-quantumania-hits-tracking-with-120m-projected-u-s-debut-its-all-about-kang-1235241780/">Deadline</a> report, which cites industry sources. If the prediction is accurate, Quantumania will be the third biggest opening ever on Presidents' Day Weekend, behind Black Panther, at $241.1 million, and Deadpool, at $152.1 million. That would also be the biggest opening for the Ant-Man films generally, as Ant-Man opened at $57.2 million in 2015 and Ant-Man and the Wasp opened at $75.8 million in 2018. For the record, those are all US, not worldwide, figure</p><p>The leap in revenue makes sense, as Quantumania is the first Ant-Man movie to act as a tentpole for the MCU, launching the mega film franchise's fifth phase.

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4091477-doompatrol.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">All good things come to an end. Then again, so do bad things. If you need proof of that, take a look at the list of TV shows canceled every single year. In 2022, over 100 shows were either canceled or announced as ending. Some of them were excellent; others weren't so great and met their ends early. Now, in 2023, cancellations by networks and streaming services are off to a massive start.</p><p dir="ltr">With the year still young, plenty of TV shows are already meeting their end. Some, like Vampire Academy, failed to attract the audience to necessitate a second season. Meanwhile, long-running shows like Mayans, Titans, and Doom Patrol have announced they are entering their final seasons.</p><p dir="ltr">It can sometimes be hard to keep up with which shows have gotten the axe. Luckily for you, GameSpot has your back. Take a look below at all of the shows canceled or announced as ending in 2023 so far below. We will continue to keep this updated as the fates of more shows are announced throughout the year. And while you're at it, take a look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-110-tv-shows-canceled-or-ending-in-2022/2900-3928/">everything canceled in 2022</a>, as well as a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-20-netflix-tv-shows-canceled-in-2022/2900-3977/">special look at what Netflix cut last year</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Don't be sad your favorite shows are leaving us--be glad you had them in the first place. And given that a lot of these are on streaming services, be glad you can continue watching them over and over again until your eyes bleed Hopefully, they don't get pulled at some point.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. 1899 (Netflix)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4091462-1899_s1_e3_00_38_54_03.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Premiered on: November 17, 2022</p><p>Canceled after 1 season.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2.

<p dir="ltr">GoldenEye's watch theme has become an indelible part of the legacy of the game, immortalized in internet memes and YouTube compilations. However, the track--which plays whenever the player pauses the game--sounds a little different in the Switch version of the game, as revealed by a clip that Nintendo of America posted. Co-composer Graeme Norgate noticed the subtle omission on social media.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Missing some sounds there guys, hope this isn't the final version. <a href="https://twitter.com/grantkirkhope?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">@grantkirkhope</a></p>  — Graeme Norgate (@Norgans) <a href="https://twitter.com/Norgans/status/1618615259530678280?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">January 26, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Compare the above clip to the below YouTube video, which is the original track from the Nintendo 64.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">As spotted by ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/music-tracks-in-the-switch-version-of-goldeneye-are-missing-instruments-samples.679864/">Lady Bow</a>, the track is missing a pitched-down cymbal sample (a sonar-like sound) that's used in several tracks in the game, and the snare is also missing reverb.

<p dir="ltr">Following the news that post-apocalyptic zombie game The Day Before is receiving an eight-month delay, developer Fntastic has clarified that the delay was planned before the trademark dispute.</p><p dir="ltr">Yesterday, January 25, Fantastic <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-day-before-delayed-to-november-2023-amid-trademark-dispute-and-legal-issues/1100-6510837/">released a statement</a> announcing that its upcoming title had to be delayed due to a trademark issue. According to Fntastic, a private individual trademarked the name The Day Before in the US prior to the developer, leading to the game being blocked on Steam. According to a new statement from Fntastic provided to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-day-before-devs-say-delay-was-planned-before-trademark-dispute">IGN</a>, this delay was planned before the trademark dispute.</p><p dir="ltr">"We planned to move the game's release before and plan to announce it with [publisher] Mytona in a 10-minute gameplay video. And then you all know what happened. So to be on the safe side, to ensure there are no more transfers, we, along with the publisher, chose November 10. That is a safe date, given the trademark dispute." This is the second delay the game has received, the first being when it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/open-world-zombie-mmo-the-day-before-delayed-to-2023-switches-to-unreal-engine-5/1100-6503148/">switched to Unreal Engine 5 last year</a>.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-day-before-was-going-to-be-delayed-even-without-the-trademark-dispute-says-developer-fntastic/1100-6510902/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvels-midnight-suns/">Marvel's Midnight Suns</a>' first DLC hero and missions are now available with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-midnight-suns-deadpool-dlc-gets-a-january-release-date-and-a-new-trailer/1100-6510707/">Deadpool The Good, The Bad, and The Undead DLC</a>. Deadpool is the first of four announced DLC heroes coming to Midnight Suns. Like many of the other heroes available in the game, Deadpool will need to be recruited before he can join you on your crusade against Lillith. Here's where and how you can access Deadpool in Marvel's Midnight Suns.</p><h2 dir="ltr">You need Deadpool's buddy Spider-Man first</h2><p dir="ltr">If you haven't played through Marvel's Midnight Suns or have started a new game plus run, you will need to play for a few hours before you can recruit Deadpool. Specifically, <strong>you need to beat the Spidermaaaans mission</strong>, recruit Spider-Man to the team, and wait for him to become comfortable enough with the rest of the Midnight Sun's to remove his mask and reveal his secret identity. Once you have completed that mission Deadpool's first mission will be available.</p><p dir="ltr">If you are picking up a save after this point, the game won't notify you that the mission is available, but it will be. Head over to the Mission Table and navigate to New York. Here, you can find the <strong>A Man of Culture Deadpool story mission</strong>, which will start you down the path to unlock Deadpool and complete his series of missions. Deadpool is the first of four announced DLC packs coming to Marvel's Midnight Suns in 2023, with Venom, Morbius, and Storm all coming later, each with their own set of missions and challenges.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-midnight-suns-how-to-start-the-deadpool-dlc/1100-6510901/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Shazam! Fury Of The God's Second Trailer Ups The Ante With Helen Mirren And A Drake Remix

<p dir="ltr">Warner Bros. has given us another look at Shazam! Fury of the Gods ahead of its postponed March 17 release date and it has… a trailer-specific remix of Drake's Started From the Bottom.</p><p dir="ltr">Shazam! Fury Of The Gods was initially meant to come out last month, though did suffer from a delay to March, and now with this second trailer we have more of an idea of what to expect from the sequel. While the first trailer offered some of that familiar goofy aloofness from the first film, this second trailer has upped the drama factor a touch.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">For one, it seems like Freddy Freeman is being taken out of the running, as Hespera (Helen Mirren) uses a magic stick of some kind to take his power. Hespera is joined by Kalypso, dubbed the sisters of Atlas, who aren't very happy that the Shazam family have supposedly taken their god-like powers. The second trailer does make it seem like a number of the kids lose their powers, though Freddy seems like the big one to lose out.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shazam-fury-of-the-gods-second-trailer-ups-the-ante-with-helen-mirren-and-a-drake-remix/1100-6510897/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Driven by pastel views and a Studio Ghibli-like take on existentialism, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/season-a-letter-to-the-future/">Season: A Letter To The Future</a> is a reposeful illustration of how memories define who we are. The new IP from the team that worked on 2018's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/darwin-project/">Darwin Project</a> follows a young woman named Estelle who leaves her home for the first time to meet other people and document moments for the future before a mysterious cataclysm washes everything away. It's an indie adventure that provokes creativity with a film camera and a bicycle tour that steadies the heart with immersion, so here's how long it actually takes to beat Season.</p><p>For more tips, keepsakes, and polaroids, read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/season-a-letter-to-the-future-review-the-meditation-game/1900-6418020/">Season review</a>.</p><h2>How long is Season: A Letter To The Future?</h2><figure style="width: 2887px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1749/17491727/4090983-season-estelleathome.jpg"><img alt="Season is all about moments and memories." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1749/17491727/4090983-season-estelleathome.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Season is all about moments and memories.</figcaption></figure><p>Season is a third-person atmospheric adventure game <strong>that will take you 8-12 hours to beat</strong>.

<p>According to a new report, Netflix's Stranger Things was 2022's most-streamed TV series in the US. Nielsen data shared by <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/stranger-things-2022-most-streamed-tv-show-1235310226/">The Hollywood Reporter</a> said the show racked up 52 billion minutes of viewing during 2022.</p><p>The uptick in viewership was no doubt fueled by the release of Season 4 in May.

A new gameplay trailer highlights how players can take on the creature with various weaponry.</p><p dir="ltr">For starters, there's the Claw Blade. This appears to be similar to the dual blades in the Monster Hunter franchise, but in Wild Hearts, there are a lot more aerial acrobatics going on with the weapon.

It's massive like a rocket launcher, featuring different ways to blast the Golden Tempest.

## Dead Space Remake Review - Hits The Marker

<p dir="ltr">14 years is a long time in the video games industry, yet it still doesn't feel like quite long enough for EA’s Dead Space. The original 2008 game is a modern classic that holds up exceedingly well by today's standards. There's very little that feels dated about its design, and the strategic dismemberment that forms the basis of its combat still offers a unique and gory thrill that's yet to be replicated. The remake's leap in graphical fidelity breathes new life into its stifling horror, but public discourse has centered on whether it really needs to exist in the first place. That might be a cynical viewpoint, but it's no less valid. And after reaching the end credits myself, I'm still not entirely convinced it needs to either, yet I'm extremely happy it does. Remaking Dead Space in 2023 may not feel especially necessary, but EA Motive has crafted a game that manages to improve upon its excellent progenitor in a variety of ways--even if only marginally so.</p><p dir="ltr">These improvements begin with its story, which has been expanded via a number of alterations to both its characters and storytelling. The basic beats that make up the original game's narrative remain intact, starting with your fateful arrival on the USG Ishimura. After responding to a distress signal, you find the hulking planet cracker-class ship floating lifelessly above the planet of Aegis VII. Once on board, things take a familiar sharp turn downhill, but now once-silent protagonist Isaac Clarke has been given a voice to react appropriately. I'm generally not a fan of silent protagonists, although there's always a danger of vocal characters being overly chatty, especially in a horror game where atmosphere and tension are so delicate. Thankfully, that's not the case here, and Isaac's newfound agency makes him feel less like a simple tool to be ordered around. Actor Gunner Wright reprises the role after bringing Isaac to life in Dead Space's sequels, so there's a level of continuity here that's also reflected in other aspects of the remake's design.</p><p dir="ltr">Much of the script has been rewritten to accommodate Isaac's speech, and the tale it weaves is still engaging. The church of Unitology--a cultish religious sect that plays a significant role in the Dead Space universe--is much more prominent this time around, especially early on. Characters mention the infamous church in a way that feels natural, discussing the sect before they're aware of just how substantial its impact will be on future events. Kendra Daniels--one of Isaac's colleagues and your main point of contact throughout the game--has also been rewritten in a manner that elevates the remake. Previously she was prickly and leaned into some needlessly antagonistic behavior, but she's now been transformed into an empathetic character, which pays off down the line in a more effective way than before.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dead-space-remake-review-hits-the-marker/1900-6418021/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>After starting a globetrotting world that saw scores of people succumb to karmic justice via the helping hand of one barcoded assassin, IO Interactive's recent trilogy of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hitman-3-to-become-hitman-world-of-assassination/1100-6510247/">Hitman games now exist under one roof</a>. The World of Assassination collection spans all the locations that were visited in Hitman 1-3, ranging from a scenic racing circuit in Miami to the bustling markets of Marrakesh</p><p>Hitman 3 owners will be able to access content from the previous two games through the Access Pass system, which will be a free upgrade on all platforms. If you haven't yet played any of the Hitman games, you'll be able to dive into The World of Assassination via a new $70 bundle that is now available. This bundle includes Hitman: Game of the Year Edition, Hitman 2, and Hitman 3, while the $30 World of Assassination Deluxe Pack completes the entire collection with the rest of the outstanding DLC such as the Seven Deadly Sins campaign and the sniper challenge maps.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hitman-3-new-rocky-level-arrives-in-july-freelancer-mode-coming-later-in-2022/1100-6503142/">Freelancer mode</a> has also gone live in Hitman, and essentially turns the game into a roguelite experience as Agent 47 tracks down a dangerous cabal of international criminals. Unlike the regular Hitman experience in which you have all the unlocked tools of the trade ready to use, you'll need to plan your approach to taking out targets. Players will have to build and maintain an arsenal of gear, choose what to bring with them, and potentially lose their loadout in a mode that IO describes as an independent experience.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hitman-3-has-officially-been-renamed-adds-new-freelancer-mode/1100-6510886/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hogwarts-legacy/">Hogwarts Legacy</a> is one of 2023's most-anticipated games. Fans have been waiting a while for it, and following multiple delays, it's finally set for release on February 10. The game's upcoming release has been overshadowed in part by Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling's comments about transgender issues. Game director Alan Tew responded to the concerns people have about the game given the backdrop and context surrounding its release.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-developers-respond-to-controversy">Speaking to IGN</a>, Tew said Hogwarts Legacy isn't unlike other games that Avalanche Software developed previously, in that every game poses challenges to its developer. Tew said it was important to the developers that Hogwarts Legacy feels like the game Harry Potter fans might have dreamed of years ago, long before Rowling made any comments about sex and gender.</p><p>"I think for us there are challenges in every game we've worked on. This game has been no different. When we bumped into those challenges, we went back and refocused on the stuff that we really care about. We know our fans fell in love with the Wizarding World, and we believe they fell in love with it for the right reasons," he said. "We know that's a diverse audience. For us, it's making sure that the audience, who always dreamed of having this game, had the opportunity to feel welcomed back. That they have a home here and that it's a good place to tell their story."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-dev-responds-to-controversy-but-doesnt-mention-jkr/1100-6510887/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><h2>Marvel Movie Multiples: 20 Actors Who Have Played More Than One Marvel Character</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4083943-5-chris-evans-human-torch.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">The Marvel Cinematic Universe began with Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk back in 2008. However, movie adaptations of Marvel Comics go back much further than that, including a 1944 Captain America serial and live-action TV movies for Spider-Man and Doctor Strange. That means that while the MCU is only 15 years old, Marvel-based cinema is closer to 80. In that time, a number of actors have played more than one Marvel character across different series--sometimes concurrently, while other times we've seen an actor play one character, only to take on another, years later.</p><p dir="ltr">The performances also vary in size, with actors sometimes playing bit parts before moving onto superstardom or getting their superhero cinema career going in fits and starts. Josh Brolin dominated 2019 Marvel movies by playing both Infinity Saga villain Thanos and Deadpool 2 antagonist Cable at the same time. Fan-favorite actor Idris Elba played a role in the poorly-received Ghost Rider sequel before going on to the slightly meatier Heimdall in Thor. Vincent D'Onofrio is best known for playing Wilson Fisk in the Daredevil Netflix series, but his first Marvel role was grandfathered in through purchases of smaller labels--keep reading to find out what it is. Everyone knows that Ryan Reynolds had a false start as Deadpool in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, but fewer people remember that he played Hannibal King in Blade: Trinity.</p><p>What's clear is that it's not unheard of for a single actor to play a variety of characters in Marvel Comics lore. As for who's done it and how many roles they've played, we've mapped out every actor to play multiple Marvel characters. Take a look below and see how many of them you know about. After you check out this list, head over to our other Marvel actors gallery to see <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/9-mcu-characters-that-were-recast/2900-4465/">which Marvel <em>characters </em>have been played by more than one actor</a> due to recasting.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. Josh Brolin - Cable &amp; Thanos</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4083944-1-josh-brolin-cable.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>2018 was a busy year for Josh Brolin, who is already a busy guy. He was the primary antagonist in not one but two Marvel movies, as two different characters, owned by two different studios. Within just a couple of months of each other, Fox's Deadpool 2 and Marvel's Avengers: Infinity Warhit theaters, both doing huge numbers for their respective studios. In Infinity War, Brolin played Thanos as he executed his plan to erase half of all life across the entire universe--for its own good. In Deadpool 2, meanwhile, things are a bit more personal but no less comic book-y, as Brolin played Cable, a man from the future who has traveled back in time to kill a younger version of Firefist, the man that would later kill his family.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. Ryan Reynolds - Deadpool, Crappy Deadpool, and Hannibal King</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4083945-2-ryan-reynolds-deadpool.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Also from Deadpool 2 is Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool, star of the first two Deadpool films and the upcoming Deadpool &amp; Wolverine picture. What Ryan and Marvel fans alike would prefer to forget, though, is the first time he played Deadpool. Reynolds joined the cast of X-Men Origins: Wolverine as Wade Wilson, who would be given mutant powers later in the movie. In what might be the most "pre-MCU" comic book movie move, though, the filmmakers thought that it might be okay to take the character nicknamed "the Merc with a Mouth" and literally <em>remove his mouth</em>. And also he had eye lasers? It would take only another seven years and a demo tape that Reynolds himself definitely didn't leak for him to bring the character to life the way he and the fans both wanted. Even earlier than that, in 2004, Reynolds appeared in Blade Trinity as Hannibal King.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. Mahershala Ali - Cottonmouth &amp; Blade</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4083946-3-mahershala-ali-cottonmouth.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">While he hasn't debuted as Blade yet, actor Mahershala Ali is set to follow in the steps of Wesley Snipes, who played the character in 3 early comic book films. This will be his second appearance in a Marvel property, though. His first came in Season 1 of the Marvel-Netflix collaboration Luke Cage. There, he played crime boss Cornell "Cottonmouth" Stokes, an early standout villain in the Defenders series of shows, and one of the few that could really stand alongside Vincent D'onofrio's Wilson Fisk in terms of dramatic performance and quietly menacing demeanor.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. Alfre Woodard - Mariah Dillard &amp; Miriam Sharpe</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4083947-4-alfre-woodard-mariah.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>Alongside Ali in Luke Cage was Alfre Woodard, who played Cottonmouth's sister, Mariah Dillard, through both seasons of the show, a woman willing to do whatever it takes to survive and thrive following the death of her brother in Season 1. Her other role is more of a cameo--in Captain America: Civil War, she plays a woman whose son was killed during the battle of Sokovia, and helps to convince Tony Stark to side with the Sokovia Accords.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. Chris Evans - Captain America &amp; Johnny Storm</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4083943-5-chris-evans-human-torch.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Evans, one of Hollywood's Top Chrises (see also Hemsworth, Pine), is best known these days for his role as Captain America in three Captain America films and four Avengers films; the role certainly played into his recent crowning as People's Sexiest Man Alive. Probably not contributing to the role was his turn as Johnny Storm, also known as the Human Torch, in two Fantastic Four movies released by Fox.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. Michael B Jordan - Killmonger &amp; Johnny Storm</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4083948-6-michael-b-jordan-human-torch.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Evans isn't the only actor to start out with a disappointing turn as Johnny Storm. Michael B. Jordan stepped into the role of Sue Storm's adopted brother in Josh Trank's critically-panned superhero film Fantastic Four in 2015. His Marvel redemption came more quickly, though, as he had to wait just 3 years to play Killmonger in Black Panther, who is regarded by many MCU fans as one of the very best villains in a series of films with literally dozens of villains.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. Kenneth Choi - Jim Morita &amp; Principal Morita</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4083949-7-kenneth-choi-morita.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">While many of these dual castings seem like a matter of pure chance or someone not paying attention, this one was planned for. Kenneth Choi's Jim Morita fought alongside supersoldier Steve Rogers in World War II. Almost 80 years later, his descendant, Principal Morita told Peter Parker to chill out and stay in line. Behind the Principal sits a photo of Jim. This is an awesome way to bring a little bit of that MCU interconnectivity in for eagle-eyed viewers to latch onto.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>8. Idris Elba - Heimdall &amp; Moreau</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4083950-8-idris-elba-moreau.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Idris Elba is one of the best-loved actors around these days thanks to movies like The Losers and shows like Luther. Unfortunately, Marvel wasted his talents not once but twice. The Thor movies would try to do better by him as the series went on, especially in Thor: Ragnarok, but the reality is that he was mostly there to open doors for Thor Odinson's adventures and to answer his calls for help from wherever. That's bad enough, but Elba--who seems like a great actor with sometimes terrible taste--joined the cast of Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance, the second Nicholas Cage-led Ghost Rider film. There, he played a drunken monk, but not the Jackie Chan kind. He's always a joy to see in any movie, but this isn't the "good" kind of Nicholas Cage movie.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>9. Vincent D'Onofrio, technically - Edgar the alien &amp; Wilson Fisk</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4083951-9-vincent-donofrio-fisk.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Did you know that Men In Black is a Marvel comic? In the most technical sense, anyway--Aircel published Men in Black, and then Malibu bought Aircel, and in 1994 Marvel bought Malibu. By the time the Men in Black movie came out in 1997, then, it counted as a Marvel comic. The film features D'Onofrio as an alien cockroach using the body of a guy named Edgar, and D'onofrio does some excellent physical comedy in the movie.</p><p dir="ltr">It was not until 2015, though, that he would become a Marvel icon. The incredible first season of Daredevil introduced us to the first live-action version of Wilson Fisk, the Kingpin, and gave him a deep inner life guided by noble, misguided ideas, and simmering rage. Even 7 years later, he's still one of the best-loved live-action Marvel villains, and fans rejoiced when he appeared in Hawkeye in 2021.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>10. Rebecca Romijn - Mystique &amp; Joan</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4083952-10-rebecca-romijn-mystique.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Many of these stories are glow-up tales, where an actor played a Marvel character in a crappy movie, and then joined the MCU and made a splash. This is not one of them. Rebecca Romijn joined the cast of 2000's X-Men as Mystique, the shape-changing mutant who acted as Magneto's infiltrator. Romijn had hellishly bad make-up sessions for that movie, but she was a major player in it. In 2004, she was a supporting cast member in Tom Jane's Punisher film, where her role was to patch up the drunken Frank Castle and be unloved by him. Tom Jane is enjoyable as the Punisher, but much of the rest of the movie--including the material Romijn was given to work with--leaves something to be desired.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>11. Jon Favreau - Foggy Nelson &amp; Happy Hogan</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4083953-11-jon-favreau-happy-hogan.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Before Mighty Ducks alumnus Elden Nelson stepped into the shoes of Foggy Nelson for the Netflix Daredevil show, Jon Favreau played the character alongside Ben Affleck's version of Matt Murdock. Favreau was starting to make waves on the other side of the camera around this time, with the now-classic holiday movie Elf debuting in the same year as Daredevil. Favreau began to shift more to directing than acting and helped kick off the MCU with the 2008 Iron Man. In essence, he was one of the very first MCU characters as Happy Hogan, Tony Stark's driver/head of security/best buddy/Spider-Man babysitter, and he played the role in a variety of MCU movies up until 2021's Spider-Man: No Way Home, where Dr. Strange's spell erased Peter Parker's identity from his memory. There's no word yet if he'll be reprising the character further, but with Tony dead and Peter effectively erased, Happy may have moved on from the Superhero Concierge business.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>12. Gemma Chan - Minn-Erva &amp; Sersi</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4083954-12-gemma-chan-sersi.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Gemma Chan first joined the MCU as Minn-Erva in Captain Marvel. There, the writers reimagined the Kree geneticist as a tactical sniper. For some reason. Minn-Erva didn't make it to the end of the movie, though, and that opened Chan up for Chloe Zhao to cast her as Sersi in the Eternals. Unfortunately for all that movie's ambition, it ended up falling pretty flat as a result of having too many characters and too much history to wade through, and Chan's Sersi struggled to stand out among the ensemble.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>13. Evan Peters - Quicksilver and Ralph Bohner</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4083955-13-evan-peters-quicksilver.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">While Taylor-Johnson moved from playing Wanda's dead brother to getting his own movie, Evan Peters joined the MCU to play a prank on viewers. Peters played Quicksilver, the same character as Taylor-Johnson, in X-Men: Days of Future Past, Apocalypse, and Dark Phoenix, though in these movies he was a mutant like all of the other X-Men, instead of an infinity stone experiment. He has some iconic scenes as Quicksilver thanks to some assistance from a very good visual effects team. When he appeared as Wanda's "brother" in the 2020 show WandaVision, it seemed like the MCU was making the X-Men movies a canonical part of the MCU, kicking the doors open to the multiverse. Instead, Peters wasn't actually playing Wanda's brother. He was just Ralph Bohner, an actor whose name sounds like a part of human anatomy. Many fans got the joke, loving the idea that it was all a big prank, while other fans took the joke deadly seriously and felt manipulated.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>14. Laurence Fishburne - The Silver Surfer and Goliath/Bill Foster</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4083956-14-laurence-fishburne-bill-foster.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Laurence Fishburne was one of the primary <em>ant</em>-agonists in Ant-Man and the Wasp. There, he played Hank Pym's old colleague, Dr. Bill Foster. Foster held a grudge against Pym, and was trying to help the daughter of another former colleague escape her quantum-shifting condition. 11 years earlier, though, he had his first Marvel adventure as the voice of the Silver Surfer in Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer. Physical actor Doug Jones provided the bodywork for the character, as he's done in so many other movies, while Fishburne's deep voice gives the Silver Surfer the ethereal quality needed for the intergalactic traveler.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>15. Doug Jones - "Joey" and The Silver Surfer</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4083957-15-doug-jones-silver-surfer.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">While Fishburne lent his voice to the shiny spaceman in Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, Doug Jones was, again, the character's physical form. He had a <em>technical</em> Marvel role before that, though, in 2002's Men in Black II, where he played Joey. Jones' contributions to this picture were not as notable as his contributions to Fantastic Four (or any of the many Guillermo del Toro movies he's made a huge impression in). The bigger surprise here is that, with how many comic book and genre films he's appeared in, Rise of the Silver Surfer is his only substantial Marvel appearance. Outside of Marvel, he's appeared in the first two Hellboy films, the Flash and Arrow tv series, and lots of other genre films.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>16. Kate Mara - U.S. Marshal and Sue Storm</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4083958-16-kate-mara-sue-storm.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">While Kate Mara's second Marvel outing was undoubtedly higher profile than her first, it's hard to call it an upgrade. Mara first appeared in 2007's Iron Man 2, where she played an unnamed U.S. Marshal. That's about the time when her star began to rise and she started appearing more frequently and in more substantial roles. Her next Marvel role wouldn't be part of the MCU, though. Instead, Mara took on the role of Susan Storm in 2015's critically panned Fantastic Four movie, directed by Josh Trank. The less said about that movie, the better.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>17. Olivia Munn - Chess Roberts and Psylocke</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4083959-17-olivia-munn-psylocke.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Munn's journey with Marvel isn't that different from Mara's. Munn appeared in Iron Man 2 as reporter Chess Roberts, who is covering the Stark Expo in that movie. At least she gets a name, right? In 2016, Munn joined X-Men: Apocalypse as Psylocke, a mutant who can form psychic blades. Her look was the rare comics-perfect transition from page to screen, though like Fantastic Four, the movie, in general, was poorly received by critics and moviegoers alike.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>18. Ray Stevenson - Frank Castle and Volstagg of the Warriors Three</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4083960-18-ray-stevenson-punisher.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Stevenson first appeared in 2008's Punisher: War Zone as Frank Castle, the third actor to step into the role after a forgettable turn by Dolph Lundgren and a much better--but still flawed--film starring Tom Jane. Roger Ebert called the movie "one of the best-made mad movies" he'd ever seen. Later, Stevenson joined the cast of Thor as Volstagg, of Lady Sif and the Warriors Three, and appeared in Thor: The Dark World and Thor: Ragnarok after that.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>19. Patton Oswalt - Blade Trinity, Agents of SHIELD, and MODOK</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4083961-19-patton-oswalt-shield.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Geeky comedian Patton Oswalt has found his way to Marvel in a variety of ways. Aside from his legendary Parks &amp; Rec rant that has him filibustering the imagined culmination of the Infinity Saga, involving Star Wars and the X-Men, he's popped up in at least 3 Marvel properties. He found continued employment on ABC's Agents of Shield as the Koenig brothers. As Eric, Billy, Sam, Thurston, and their grandfather Ernest, he appeared in ten episodes of the series. Most recently, he starred as MODOK, the Mechanical Organism Designed Only for Killing, on Hulu's series of the same name. The project seems to have been Hulu's attempt at replicating the success of HBO Max's Harley Quinn. The show didn't get much attention and only lasted for ten episodes. In that time though, it managed to accrue a long list of comedy names in its cast list, including Sam Richardson, Beck Bennett, Ben Schwartz, Melissa Fumero, Jon Hamm, Bill Hader, Alan Tudyk, Nathan Fillion, Whoopi Goldberg, Brian Posehn, Chris Parnell, and Eddie Pepitone.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>20. Stan Lee: Bus passenger and delivery guy and store clerk and cosmic being and…</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4083962-20-stan-lee-every-character.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">You didn't think we were going to leave out Stan the Man, did you? For as many Marvel movies as actors like Chris Evans and Hemsworth have been in, they can't begin to even match the late comic legend's record in terms of sheer appearances. Stan Lee appeared in every MCU movie up through Avengers: Endgame. Even before that, he appeared in Marvel live-action adaptations as far back as 2000's original X-Men film.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />

<p>Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul, the stars of AMC's Breaking Bad, are reprising their characters for a Super Bowl commercial, and a new teaser has been revealed.</p><p>Cranston and Paul, who played Walt and Jesse on the show, are getting back together to promote the snack PopCorners. In the new teaser, Walt is munching down on a bag as Jesse tries to start the RV/meth lab. The teaser pays homage to the Season 2 Episode 9 scene where Walt and Jesse are trapped in the desert due to Jesse mistakenly leaving the key in the ignition and thus draining the battery. If the RV interior looks very much like how you remember it, that's because it's the same exact interior set used on the AMC show years ago.</p><div>          </div><p>Walt and Jesse will be joined by the Breaking Bad character Tuco Salamanca (Raymond Cruz) in the Super Bowl ad for PopCorners, which is owned by PepSiCo. The TV spot is directed by none other than Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan, <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/breaking-bad-super-bowl-commercial-popcorners-1235502826/">according to Variety</a>.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/see-bryan-cranston-and-aaron-paul-reprise-breaking-bad-characters-in-super-bowl-teaser/1100-6510883/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Season: A Letter To The Future Review - The Meditation Game

<p dir="ltr">Some games demand a specific kind of real-life setting to really be absorbed. Horror games beg for the lights off and headphones on, while co-op games are often more enjoyable when played together on a couch rather than online. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/season-a-letter-to-the-future/">Season: A letter to the future</a> requires its own special circumstances--a calm, peaceful environment--and if you can provide that, you'll find in it a special stillness, a pensive story, and a memoir from a fantasy land worth experiencing.</p><p dir="ltr">Sometimes the language of open-world games is obvious, especially if you've played a few of them. Excitingly, Season doesn't feel like such a game, as its approach to gameplay and story are fresh and largely disinterested in giving you boxes to check. You play as Estelle, a young woman who sets off to observe and record a part of her world on the precipice of a new season. In this unnamed world, which is like ours but also definitely is not ours, a new season doesn't mean just a change in temperature; it means a total rebirth of the state of things. The game is deliberately unclear regarding exactly why, when, or how seasons emerge, and it seems at least sometimes they are influenced by people rather than natural things that happen to those people. Seasons seem to be more defined by the particular circumstances of a society--the breakout of war or widespread sleep, for example--more than they are snow days or fallen foliage.</p><p dir="ltr">For Estelle, it's important to document the outgoing season as all will be lost when the new season begins, even as no one seems sure what that season will usher in itself. For the people of Tieng Valley, a lush farming village that's largely been evacuated due to an imminent dam collapse, the beginning of the season may even be a matter of life and death. Equipped with a camera, audio recorder, scrapbook, and bicycle, Estelle treks into the valley to interview the last remaining locals, capture the state of the vista in its final days, and reflect on things like memory, community, and grief. These, and other themes, are delivered through thoughtful monologues and conversations that allow for players to insert themselves in the story.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/season-a-letter-to-the-future-review-the-meditation-game/1900-6418020/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Respawn Unveils New DDoS Protection For Apex Legends

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/">Apex Legends</a> developer Respawn Entertainment has announced a new feature that's sure to please players around the globe: DDoS protection. The announcement was made on Twitter, and included a request for player feedback.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Predator, Master, and Diamond <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayApex?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">@Playapex</a> players, this one's for you:<br /><br />We've just rolled out DDOS protection for Diamond through Predator lobbies.

This is somewhat disappointing news for players who aren't Ranked Mode die-hards, but the announcement tweet's request for feedback and reference to the "ever-evolving" nature of protecting Apex Legends from bad actors suggests future changes may be on the horizon.</p><p dir="ltr">Apex has been the target of several DDoS attacks in the past. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/two-apex-legends-players-banned-for-ddos-attack-on-xbox/1100-6489418/">Two Xbox players were banned</a> in March 2021 after being identified as the source of an attack, with Respawn <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/respawn-takes-huge-steps-in-fighting-apex-legends-ddos-cheaters/1100-6492289/">making an announcement</a> later that summer to assure players that new avenues were being pursued to protect the game from future attacks.

<p>Weapon focusing is set for a big overhaul once Destiny 2's Lightfall expansion goes live, and in a new post, developer Bungie has detailed how you'll be able to get your hands on some of the best loot in the game. Commander Zavala, who players usually visit to stock up on Strike bounties and rewards earned from leveling up his vendor rank, will have a bigger role to play in Season 20 as he will offer the ability for players to focus Vanguard weapons and armor.</p><p><a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/season-20-legacy-focusing">According to Bungie</a>, Vanguard engrams will be a virtual currency and will live exclusively on the Rank Progress bar on Commander Zavala. With Umbral engrams being retired, Vanguard Engrams will be made available and can be focused into either Vanguard armor or Vanguard weapons. although individual pieces of gear must have been acquired at least once prior to being available for focusing.</p><p>For Season 20, Zavala will offer the Photosuede armor set and the following Vanguard weapons:</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/weapon-focusing-in-destiny-2-lightfall-will-see-plenty-of-legacy-gear-return/1100-6510877/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Destiny 2: Lightfall Will See Umbral Engrams Retired

<p>A lot of big changes are coming to Destiny 2 next month when the Lightfall expansion arrives, as well as hundreds of smaller tweaks that'll have a big impact on the game's economy. Bungie detailed more of these extensive changes in a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/season-20-legacy-focusing">blog update</a>, which will see Umbral engrams retired, new focusing options for gear across the board, and most importantly for fashionistas, the return of armor shaders that have been unavailable for quite some time.</p><p>Umbral engrams have been a regular part of the Destiny 2 economy for several seasons now, but from Season 20, these will no longer drop in the game. These engrams have usually obtained as a reward when completing various activities or a random drop from enemies, and have been used to acquire weapons and gear from the seasonal world loot pool since Season 11. Bungie says that seasonal content will transition to seasonal engrams being used, and any Umbral engrams that you have in your inventory after Season 20 starts can be decrypted by Master Rahool in the Tower.</p><p>Ada-1, the vendor who first appeared in the Black Armory DLC and later moved into the Tower, will also see her role changed once Lightfall goes live. While she currently offers armor synthesis bounties that reward players with transmog materials upon her completion, her role as an armor mod vendor is coming to an end. With Lightfall making armor mods free to all players as part of a more focused build-crafting push, Ada-1 will have a rotating stock of armor shaders for sale.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lightfall-will-see-umbral-engrams-retired/1100-6510876/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
