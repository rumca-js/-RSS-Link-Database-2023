<p>Expectation and reality seem to have aligned in north London, giving Mikel Arteta’s side a sense of unstoppable momentum</p><p>Sunday in London and all you can see is fumes: hot breath on cold air and vape smoke and dope smoke and steam rising from sweaty heads and a hype they can finally believe in. Of course Eddie Nketiah is delighted and of course Oleksandr Zinchenko is delighted, but have you ever in your life seen such happy unused substitutes? Sunday in London and it doesn’t matter whether you’re in the back row pressed against the stained glass, or so close you can grasp the hem of the preacher’s garment. Everyone in this congregation gets saved in the end.</p><p>The post-Christmas Emirates is a different place to what it was pre-Christmas. There’s a swagger and an arrogance here now, the sweet spot where old certainties meet new stirrings. And they no longer ask, they demand. Even the sticky periods are waited out with measured impatience rather than dull dread. OK, Marcus Rashford. Nice header, Lisandro Martínez. But what time do we actually <em>win</em>?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jan/22/arsenal-strut-past-manchester-united-with-unmistakable-aura-of-champions">Continue reading...</a>

## Helen Graham’s secret ingredient: sumac

<p>Bubala’s executive chef on the powdered sour berry that works with sweet and  savoury dishes</p><p>Sumac is a sour berry. It’s dried and ground into a ruby red powder. I discovered it at [London restaurant] the Palomar when I first started cooking there. The head chef at the time was using it in sweet and savoury dishes. There would be sumac marshmallows and meringues and sumac and lemon tarts but we would also add it to a fattoush salad. It’s used in a lot of Middle Eastern cookery to add a sour tangy flavour.</p><p>I use it in addition to lemon juice because it gives a different level of tang and you can create layers of flavour. I add it to salad dressings and pesto. I’ve used it in a sorrel and pumpkin seed pesto, as sorrel has a very similar flavour profile. Whiz up sorrel, parsley, toasted pumpkin seeds, olive oil, sumac, lemon juice and maple syrup, and use it to dress fresh crunchy things like a kohlrabi and apple slaw. It’s great with fruit – especially red berries like roasted strawberries; I roast them with sugar, lemon juice and sumac. Toss it with red onions and lemon juice and serve it on the side of falafel with tahini. Sumac cuts through rich dishes beautifully. My palate loves sour flavours so I can go quite hard with it but for someone who is new to it, I would suggest a sprinkle and see how you go.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/22/helen-grahams-secret-ingredient-sumac">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For four years, Victoria Fiore follows bright, personable Entoni, at the mercy of Italy’s new law concerning children from organised crime families</p><p>Plenty of documentaries capture the spirit of their subjects; far fewer get fully under the skin of the world that they inhabit. Victoria Fiore’s remarkable debut film, shot over four years in Naples, is one such picture. Boasting extraordinary access and lithe, instinctive cinematography that captures the unpredictable energy and distinctive dialect of the neighbourhood, it focuses on a streetwise kid, Entoni. Unruly and mischievous, Entoni dreams of movie stardom but his fate is linked to his family history: his chain-smoking grandmother, Dora, has ties to organised crime. This places him on the radar of the Italian authorities, who, in response to rising youth crime, have introduced a policy stating that kids deemed to be “at risk” can be removed from families with mafia links. Using a combination of verité and poetic reconstructions, Fiore paints a sobering portrait of a bright, personable kid whose destiny is preordained.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/22/nascondino-hide-and-seek-review-victoria-fiore-remarkable-documentary-about-a-naples-street-kid">Continue reading...</a>

Songs such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODrVofka54">Supermodel</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrsbfrFPATs">Gossip</a> deal with the interesting local customs, while Timezone is a hefty ballad about singer Damiano David calling someone “every hour” so he can tell them he’s “losing [his] mind”. Pop uber-producer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/25/were-not-made-to-be-famous-max-martin-the-powerhouse-of-pure-pop">Max Martin</a> is somewhat inevitably on hand to make sure the album gleams even harder than this sharp, lurid foursome do on their own.</p><p>Unfortunately, <em>Rush!</em> is also a record that dashes about trying to tick all the boxes, with Måneskin’s English-language songs far outnumbering the Italian ones. And even though David can be perceptive and nuanced in a foreign tongue – Bla Bla Bla is a minimal new wave banger whose pithiness should not be confused with simplicity – he has a lot to get off his chest in his mother tongue. The caustic, almost rapped La Fine confirms that success is a Pandora’s box, while the gravelly glam-grunge of Il Dono Della Vita imagines returning “the gift of life”. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/22/maneskin-rush-review-less-haste-more-speed-for-italys-glam-rockers">Continue reading...</a>

## Kick the Latch by Kathryn Scanlan review – straight from the horse trainer’s mouth

<p>Despite its minimalist style, the American writer’s experimental novel tracking the life of a would-be jockey in the midwest is brimming with life</p><p>Fiction – so close to lying – has always been a suspicious enterprise, not least to those undertaking it: from the elaborate frame narratives of the 18th century (all those found texts and epistolary novels) to the research expeditions of Victorian realists to the autobiographical turn of the present, authors have long found ways to avoid seeming to make things up, or what Rachel Cusk once called the “fake and embarrassing” business of “making up John and Jane and having them do things together”.<br /><br />US writer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/06/the-dominant-animal-by-kathryn-scanlan-review-40-dark-and-unsentimental-tales">Kathryn Scanlan</a> has some especially crafty workarounds up her sleeve. One of her previous books, <em>Aug 9 – Fog</em> (2019), comprised sentences repurposed from the diary of a stranger. Her new book, <em>Kick the Latch</em>, is a kind of ghosted memoir drawn on conversations with Sonia, a horse trainer from the midwest, taking the form of a few dozen reflections and vignettes that range in length from three pages to just 15 words, as she looks back on her life and work from childhood deep into middle age.<br /><br />It opens with an eight-line reminiscence in which we learn Sonia was born in 1962 with a dislocated hip, a setback overcome within the course of the paragraph (“Ended up I could walk”), quietly sounding the keynote of a book in which trauma is never allowed to become definitive. Fending for herself in a poor neighbourhood while her largely offstage parents make rent, she wants to be a jockey from an early age, learning to ride at weekends on a horse hired by the hour: “Once, on my birthday, I got to rent him for five hours straight.”</p><p>By her teens she’s spending summers working at stables in exchange for lodging, learning “about feeding and conditioning and interval training and selective breeding and line breeding and hoof care, anatomy”. The reader learns, too: about, say, how the lungs of a racehorse are liable to fill with blood on the track, and how to stop it happening without falling foul of a dope test. Or how easily hooves shatter: “Galloping, a horse spends a lot of his time suspended in the air… When a foot lands, there’s a thousand pounds of pressure held up by that one thin leg, that little hoof the size of a handheld ashtray.”<br /><br />Sonia, a girl in a world of men, tells us she is “known as the Coca-Cola kid, because everyone wanted to buy me a drink, get me drunk, but I’d ask for soda instead.” She’s 17 when a jockey breaks into her trailer and rapes her at gunpoint; she says nothing because she doesn’t want to risk losing the career she wants. “The guy sobered up, I knew him, I seen him every day, I knew exactly who it was, it was bad, but anyway, I survived. I cut my hair real short after that.”<br /><br />It’s far from the book’s last bout of violence, but in all sorts of ways <em>Kick the Latch</em> refuses to follow the paths we might expect. Names waft through the text unglossed, adding to a heady sense that these are real people, not characters. Although there’s much tenderness as the book follows the highs and lows of Sonia’s subsequent career, including a late left turn into prison work, the overall toughness of the narration – sinewy, matter-of-fact, neither glib nor maudlin – seldom fails to jolt the reader. When an accident leaves a newly wed pal paralysed, she says: “The husband dumped her, of course. He dumped her right away.”<br /><br />Scanlan has been praised in the US by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/nov/27/lydia-davis-i-write-it-the-way-i-want-to-write-it">the experimental writer Lydia Davis</a> and her techniques resemble Davis’s own strategies for avoiding invention by using found text. But in its emotional impact, her artfully artless minimalism most recalls <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/may/18/a-brief-survey-of-the-short-story-lucia-berlin">Lucia Berlin</a>, another great writer of women and work.

<p>The writer, who is stricken in hospital after an accident, gave us real characters, not stereotypes</p><p>We had been messaging each other on Boxing Day, trying to fix a date for a drink. Then all went silent. I assumed that Hanif Kureishi was too busy enjoying himself in Rome.

<p><strong>Sundance film festival:</strong> Kristen Roupenian’s nuanced internet-breaking story of modern dating is uneasily turned into a more literal horror</p><p>As utterly inescapable as Kristen Roupenian’s viral, pop culture-piercing New Yorker short story <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/12/11/cat-person">Cat Person</a> was in 2017, it didn’t seem like an obvious fit for any form of adaptation – a button-pushing speed-read that was as popular as it was self-contained. It told the story of a 20-year-old female student who briefly dates a schlubby, unreadable guy in his mid-30s (who may or may not have cats) in a way that many found instantly, uncomfortably, relatable. It was messy and uneasy and ultimately rather chilling as briefly dating someone can often be.</p><p>Its success was such that more was sought, insisted upon even. Its author got a book deal (a collection of short stories that landed with a bit of a thud) and sold a spec script (for Gen Z whodunnit Bodies Bodies Bodies, which was ultimately almost entirely rewritten). Cat Person was bought for extension as a movie, regardless of fit. Almost six years after it appeared online, it’s arriving at Sundance as something of a curio, a reminder of an online moment more than anything else. The question of “Remember Cat Person?” is almost immediately replaced with “How did they turn Cat Person into a movie?” which then warps into “Why did they turn Cat Person into a <em>thriller</em>?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/22/cat-person-review-viral-short-story-becomes-violent-big-screen-thriller">Continue reading...</a>
