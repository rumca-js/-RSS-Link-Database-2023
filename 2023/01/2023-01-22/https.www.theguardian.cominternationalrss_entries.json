Boasting extraordinary access and lithe, instinctive cinematography that captures the unpredictable energy and distinctive dialect of the neighbourhood, it focuses on a streetwise kid, Entoni. Unruly and mischievous, Entoni dreams of movie stardom but his fate is linked to his family history: his chain-smoking grandmother, Dora, has ties to organised crime.

One of her previous books, <em>Aug 9 \u2013 Fog</em> (2019), comprised sentences repurposed from the diary of a stranger. Her new book, <em>Kick the Latch</em>, is a kind of ghosted memoir drawn on conversations with Sonia, a horse trainer from the midwest, taking the form of a few dozen reflections and vignettes that range in length from three pages to just 15 words, as she looks back on her life and work from childhood deep into middle age.<br /><br />It opens with an eight-line reminiscence in which we learn Sonia was born in 1962 with a dislocated hip, a setback overcome within the course of the paragraph (\u201cEnded up I could walk\u201d), quietly sounding the keynote of a book in which trauma is never allowed to become definitive. Fending for herself in a poor neighbourhood while her largely offstage parents make rent, she wants to be a jockey from an early age, learning to ride at weekends on a horse hired by the hour: \u201cOnce, on my birthday, I got to rent him for five hours straight.\u201d</p><p>By her teens she\u2019s spending summers working at stables in exchange for lodging, learning \u201cabout feeding and conditioning and interval training and selective breeding and line breeding and hoof care, anatomy\u201d. The reader learns, too: about, say, how the lungs of a racehorse are liable to fill with blood on the track, and how to stop it happening without falling foul of a dope test. Or how easily hooves shatter: \u201cGalloping, a horse spends a lot of his time suspended in the air\u2026 When a foot lands, there\u2019s a thousand pounds of pressure held up by that one thin leg, that little hoof the size of a handheld ashtray.\u201d<br /><br />Sonia, a girl in a world of men, tells us she is \u201cknown as the Coca-Cola kid, because everyone wanted to buy me a drink, get me drunk, but I\u2019d ask for soda instead.\u201d She\u2019s 17 when a jockey breaks into her trailer and rapes her at gunpoint; she says nothing because she doesn\u2019t want to risk losing the career she wants. \u201cThe guy sobered up, I knew him, I seen him every day, I knew exactly who it was, it was bad, but anyway, I survived. I cut my hair real short after that.\u201d<br /><br />It\u2019s far from the book\u2019s last bout of violence, but in all sorts of ways <em>Kick the Latch</em> refuses to follow the paths we might expect. Names waft through the text unglossed, adding to a heady sense that these are real people, not characters. Although there\u2019s much tenderness as the book follows the highs and lows of Sonia\u2019s subsequent career, including a late left turn into prison work, the overall toughness of the narration \u2013 sinewy, matter-of-fact, neither glib nor maudlin \u2013 seldom fails to jolt the reader. When an accident leaves a newly wed pal paralysed, she says: \u201cThe husband dumped her, of course. He dumped her right away.\u201d<br /><br />Scanlan has been praised in the US by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/nov/27/lydia-davis-i-write-it-the-way-i-want-to-write-it\">the experimental writer Lydia Davis</a> and her techniques resemble Davis\u2019s own strategies for avoiding invention by using found text. But in its emotional impact, her artfully artless minimalism most recalls <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/may/18/a-brief-survey-of-the-short-story-lucia-berlin\">Lucia Berlin</a>, another great writer of women and work.
