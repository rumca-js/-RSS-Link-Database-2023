I started using dictation for entering text on my phone and computer
when my wrists </span>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/wrist-issues">suddenly went really bad</a>,
but while my wrists are enough better that I can often type there are
still a lot of cases where I dictate. Even people whose wrists are
fine would benefit from trying it out:



<p>

</p>

<ul>

<li><p>It can be about as fast as typing on a real keyboard, which is
great on a phone. I'm very good at swiping, but I can dictate
faster.

</p></li>
<li><p>On Android, at least, it does a good job even in noisy
environments as long as I hold the phone close to my mouth. I can also
speak very fast, faster than I can compose my thoughts, and it will
still understand me. It even understands whispering!

</p></li>
<li><p>I like having it as an option for composing thoughts,
especially when I'm having trouble <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/focus">focusing</a>. Sometimes it turns out I'm not in a good
headspace for typing ideas out, but talking them through out loud
works.

</p></li>
<li><p>If your wrists do start hurting someday, being able to easily
give them a break by switching some things to dictation can help them
recover faster and make you less likely to hurt yourself. I suspect if
I had been used to dictating as needed in 2020, I wouldn't have gotten
to where I had to stop typing for a couple years.

</p></li>
</ul>



<p>

There are some downsides, however:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<ul>

<li><p>The dictation built into Android isn't great with punctuation, and I
often have to go back and fix things.

</p></li>
<li><p>The error rate, in general, is higher. For note taking or casual
texting where errors are no big deal this is less of an issue, but in
dictating this post there were several places I needed to go back and
fix something.

</p></li>
<li><p>Because mistranscriptions look more plausible than typos I'm
more likely to have errors that make it all the way through to
posting: the mistakes are less likely to stand out as obviously wrong.

</p></li>
<li><p>Fixing dictation errors is a little more annoying than when typing
because you have to switch modes.

</p></li>
<li><p>I like my dictated style slightly less than typed: it's just a bit
too wordy. This makes it more important to go back over dictated posts
looking for things to cut.

</p></li>
<li><p>The dictation built into Mac isn't very good, and it's terrible
unless I have a microphone <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/wired-headsets-for-video-calls">right next to my
mouth</a>. If I want to dictate longer things (ex: this post) I'll
dictate them on my phone and then edit on the computer.

</p></li>
<li><p>I occasionally find myself saying "comma" or "semicolon" when
talking to people.

</p></li>
</ul>



<p>

Still, I do think most people would benefit from trying it out,
especially on the phone.  It takes a little getting used to, but
mostly you talk and it writes things down.  On Android it's just a
matter of tapping the little microphone on the on-screen keyboard:
