Shockingly, the FBI and DOJ did absolutely nothing for months, while simultaneously <a href="https://www.heritage.org/crime-and-justice/commentary/fbi-justice-department-twist-federal-law-arrest-charge-pro-life" target="_blank">arresting</a> pro-life activists for protesting outside abortion clinics. Hard to believe, I know. </p><p>But last week, the FBI finally announced it's seeking information on some of the attacks. The bureau is now offering a $25,000 reward to sources who can provide details on the attacks. It said it can investigate the crimes as potential acts of domestic violent extremism, Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (FACE Act) violations, or violent crime matters. </p><p>In a statement, FBI Director Christopher Wray said, "Today’s announcement reflects the FBI’s commitment to vigorously pursue investigations into crimes against pregnancy resource centers, faith-based organizations, and reproductive health clinics across the country."</p><p>The attacks under investigation include nine on pro-life facilities and one on  Planned Parenthood. Photos of the attacks are shown below the statement, and nearly all feature a crisis pregnancy center or another type of pro-life facility. So it's pretty clear the majority of these attacks were <em>not</em> on pro-abortion facilities.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"></div><p>Well, MSNBC's <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/andrea-mitchell-pro-life" target="_blank">Andrea Mitchell</a> decided to ignore that crucial point, and instead reported the FBI is investigating terrorism exclusively on pro-abortion facilities. She asked former Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards, "What about the issue, Cecile, of what the FBI is calling domestic terrorism? They are offering $25,000 rewards for any information on recent attacks against ten reproductive health care clinics. How concerning are these attacks and the implications for the women, the emotional stress on women and health care workers?”<br /></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>
<p>Richards responded by claiming Republicans have created a "bounty hunter system" and perpetuated fear around women getting abortions. Oddly enough, there was no mention of fear felt by the crisis pregnancy centers that were firebombed. Must've been an honest mistake! MSNBC would <em>never</em> lie to push a narrative...</p><p><p>

## Very catholic Nancy Pelosi had priests perform an exorcism on her home after her husband was attacked by a nudist

The attacker was David DePape, a nudist activist and illegal immigrant from Canada. </p><p>The details of the attack have become very muddied. But strangest of all, NBC News pulled a report for not meeting its "reporting standards." I'm honestly most surprised that NBC has any journalistic standards whatsoever. </p><p>The deleted report stated that Pelosi opened the door for police and did not declare an emergency. Instead, he apparently walked back towards DePape, who was holding the hammer he eventually struck Pelosi with. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cNBC reported new details re: Pelosi attack:\n\n- Pelosi answered door, didn't "declare an emergency or try to leave his home," instead walked toward the assailant\n\n- Pelosi & DePape were in house for 30 minutes before police arrived\n\nThen NBC deleted this video from all platforms.\u201d</div> — Steve Krakauer (@Steve Krakauer)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/SteveKrak/status/1588583451858718720">1667582784</a>
</blockquote>
<p>Personally, I would choose to walk away from a nudist assailant wielding a hammer. But that's just me. </p><p>Since this all unfolded, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nancy-pelosi-snaps-reporter" target="_blank">Nancy Pelosi</a> <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/01/21/nancy-pelosi-summons-priests-to-exercise-home-of-evil-spirits/" target="_blank">reportedly</a> had priests perform an exorcism on the house. Pelosi's daughter, Alexandra, explained the event to the New York Times: "I think that weighed really heavy on her [Nancy's] soul I think it really broke her. Over Thanksgiving, she had priests coming, trying to have an exorcism of the house and having prayer services."</p><p>However, the pastor of Nancy's local parish, Father Arturo Albano, said his staff did not perform an exorcism on Pelosi's home. Pelosi could have sought help from outside her parish since San Francisco Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone banned her from receiving Holy Communion over her support for baby murder. </p><p>I'm not sure how much an exorcism could do to ward off nudist hammer attacks. That seems like a very worldly, twenty-first-century problem. But Father Vincent Lampert, exorcist for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Indianapolis, said an exorcism could help ward off any presence of evil that may linger in a home after a violent attack has occurred. </p><p>Hopefully, the exorcism worked and Pelosi and her husband enjoy a hammer-attack-free rest of their lives. The only spirits lingering in the Pelosi home should be vodka. Lots and lots of vodka. </p><p><p>

## 'Run for President': America's governor Ron DeSantis works the crowd at the Kansas City Chiefs game and fans love him

Things didn't work out as the Jags lost to the Chiefs. DeSantis would have preferred a Jaguars victory so he could then travel to Buffalo next week and watch them lose there (Go Bills).</p><p>It wasn't a total waste of a trip. The Jags kept it competitive for a while. I'm sure the Governor had some BBQ. Also, there is this video of Kansas City fans excited about meeting him and encouraging him to run for President of the United States. A thought I'm sure has never crossed the governor's mind.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">For those of us gauging how much appeal Ron DeSantis might have among Republicans, it’s interesting how many KC fans in KC (at the Jags game) appear to know who he is; one guy encourages him to run for president <br /><br /> <a href="https://t.co/jB49jIKh48">pic.twitter.com/jB49jIKh48</a><br />— Marc Caputo (@MarcACaputo) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarcACaputo/status/1617149616092323841?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 22, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>While a broad coalition of conservatives has been encouraging Ron DeSantis to run for president, the governor has given no indications that he is considering a run himself. Other than having a book come out <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-book" target="_blank">that is half autobiographical/half policy</a>, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-inauguration" target="_blank">all the speeches he's given lately</a>, and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-tread-gas-stove" target="_blank">his constant going to war with the current president</a>. But that could all be coincidental. As is using his home team playing in the NFL Playoffs as an excuse to travel to a state that happens to be in a swing state.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="2d2af" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32885778&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>The last few GOP primary polls that have been released show <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-divided-gop" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a>, the one person who has announced his candidacy, with a big lead ahead of rumored names who have not announced their candidacy yet. Whatever DeSantis is planning to do, I'm sure he has his own timeline planned out. The smart play would be to work on his time and not be forced into a rushed decision.</p><p>Some of us are just impatient.</p><p><p>

## Watch: Hilaria Baldwin brings back fake Spanish accent to yell at reporters chasing husband Alec (who killed a woman)

There was controversy some years back over her faking being Spanish, which the Boston native claimed she never did even though it wasn't a Boston accent she was speaking with.  She had dropped the accent for a while. But the media appears to have gotten her Spanish-Bostonian up.</p><p>Quick recap. Alec was recently charged with manslaughter <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joy-behar-alec-baldwin-excuse" target="_blank">for killing cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of "Rust."</a> This isn't the first time Hilaria has addressed <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/hilaria-baldwin-instagram" target="_blank">how difficult Alec killing a woman was for her</a> or <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/alec-baldwin-post-reporter" target="_blank">yelling at the media for it</a>. But she sounded a lot less Spanish then.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Hilaria Baldwin speaks out about cameras following her family after her husband Alec Baldwin was charged with involuntary manslaughter. <a href="https://twitter.com/NEWSMAX?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@NEWSMAX</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Baldwin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Baldwin</a> <a href="https://t.co/YNgHywNmZu">pic.twitter.com/YNgHywNmZu</a><br />— Mike Carter (@MikeCarterTV) <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeCarterTV/status/1616451693595557890?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>In defense of the Boston native who was born in Boston, Alec killing a woman aside we can all agree the media are vultures. Leave their kids alone. Because you and I know damn well at least one reporter is going to say something to the kids attempting to get an understandably angry reaction from Alec. We can find common ground that the media suuuuuucks.</p><p>Now let's get back to LOLing about the fake accent.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">I think we should give more credit to Hilaria for her dedication when it comes to faking her accent. I’ve never been committed to anything this much in my life <a href="https://t.co/6Da0CQtJrI">pic.twitter.com/6Da0CQtJrI</a><br />— erb (@bentleyliz2) <a href="https://twitter.com/bentleyliz2/status/1616528590203396096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Hilaria was first called out for faking being Spanish by the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/hilaria-baldwin-spanish" target="_blank">New York Times in 2020</a>. Hilaria said at the time "The things I have shared about myself are very clear. I was born in Boston. I spent time in Boston and in Spain. My family now lives in Spain. I moved to New York when I was 19 years old and I have lived here ever since."</p><p>She insists she wasn't pretending to be Spanish. Though, we can't say the same for Alec Baldwin who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBtggYMNfqo" target="_blank">impersonated the fake Spanish accent </a>his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyizpfuvmmA" target="_blank">wife allegedly didn't have during multiple media appearances</a>. That Alec is always causing problems for her.</p><p>Let's be honest. The Baldwin family has other concerns than Hilaria's cultural appropriation right now. It's just funny.</p><p><p>
