  <p id="8OK8jm">Quordle, the word-solving game that emerged at the height of Wordle’s popularity, has been acquired by Merriam-Webster, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/20/wordle-clone-quordle-acquired-by-merriam-webster/">as first reported by <em>TechCrunch</em></a>. The game now lives directly <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/games/quordle/#/">on Merriam-Webster’s website</a>, rather than on its own.</p>
<p id="2PRwk4">“I’m delighted to announce that Quordle was acquired by @MerriamWebster,” <a href="https://twitter.com/quordle/status/1616445746949279754?s=20&amp;t=KmfWeYXy8wqLLh71hzASs4aaRr5ufEsEq9qdLzsL_w0">a post on Quorlde’s Twitter account</a> reads. “I can’t think of a better home for this game. Lots of news features and fun to come, so stay tuned!”</p>
<p id="VhAm8T">Quordle is just one of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2022/1/11/22877996/wordle-spoofs-alternatives-letterle-sweardle-queerdle">many spinoffs that tried to piggyback</a> off of the success of Wordle, which had users <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/22881995/wordle-emoji-results-auto-generated-tell-a-story">posting their scores across Twitter</a> and competing with friends to solve the word of the day with the least guesses. </p>

  <p id="Z7UDhi">After years of dealing with Joy-Con drift and no satisfactory answers from Nintendo, we may finally have our solution. A company called Gulikit created a set of <a href="https://www.gulikit.com/productinfo/945307.html">Switch joystick replacements</a> that promise to banish stick drift once and for all (via <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gulikit-hall-effect-stick-nintendo-switch-joycon-drift-1850007363"><em>Gizmodo</em></a>)<em>.</em></p>
<p id="R8IkZn">If you’re a Switch owner, you’re probably well-acquainted <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained">with Joy-Con drift</a>, which creates annoying false inputs even when you’re not touching the thumbsticks. It’s been a problem ever since the Switch came out and still hasn’t been fully fixed in the new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review">OLED model</a> (although <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22715467/nintendo-joy-con-drift-never-fixed-switch-oled">Nintendo says it’s made some “improvements”</a>). While you can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/23/20707849/nintendo-will-reportedly-fix-joy-con-drift-for-free-even-out-of-warranty">send your Joy-Cons away for a free repair at Nintendo</a> (or just buy a new set), the sticks will inevitably start drifting again.</p>

## The third-party apps Twitter just killed made the site what it is today

  <p id="to4ro1">The age of great third-party Twitter clients may be over. After Twitter <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/13/23553161/third-party-twitter-clients-apps-outage-twitterific-tweetbot">cut off their API access</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/19/23562947/twitter-third-party-client-tweetbot-twitterific-ban-rules">changed its rules</a> to bar apps that compete with its own, The Iconfactory has announced that it’s <a href="https://blog.iconfactory.com/2023/01/twitterrific-end-of-an-era/">discontinuing Twitterific</a>, Fenix has <a href="https://twitter.com/fenix_app/status/1616577597042728961?s=20">been pulled from app stores</a>, and Tapbots has <a href="https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/">posted a memorial for Tweetbot</a>. It’s a loss for all the people who used the apps and, almost certainly, a loss for Twitter itself.</p>
<p id="Bvr1hZ">As many people have pointed out over the past week, third-party clients helped make Twitter the platform it is today, innovating parts of Twitter we take for granted and, in the early days, helping form the company’s very identity. They’ve also acted as a safe haven from unwanted changes, helping to keep people tweeting when they were...</p>

  <p id="VuyzGO">Apple’s working on a MacBook Air and iMac with an M3 chip built using the more efficient 3-nanometer fabrication process, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-01-22/why-apple-brought-back-the-homepod-and-launched-m2-pro-m2-max-macbook-pro-mini-ld7hrh3y?cmpid=BBD012223_POWERON&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_term=230122&amp;utm_campaign=poweron&amp;sref=ExbtjcSG">according to a report from <em>Bloomberg</em>’s Mark Gurman</a>. While it’s not clear when the two upgraded devices might launch, Gurman expects the M3 chip to arrive later this year or early next year.</p>
<p id="qc2YmL">Gurman first <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/26/23183875/apple-gearing-up-launch-flood-new-devices-this-fall-m2-chip-macbook-iphone-14-watch-series-9">hinted at this in June of last year</a>, noting that Apple’s working on an M3-equipped 13-inch MacBook Air, 15-inch MacBook Air, and a new iMac. At the time, he added that the M3 chip could appear as early as this year, but that hasn’t happened.</p>
<p id="WqPvhs">Instead, Apple included the new M2 Pro and M2 Max chips with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/17/23553739/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-m2-pro-max-price">lineup of MacBook Pros</a> it announced earlier this month, and also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/17/23387288/apple-mac-mini-m2-pro-price-release-date-specs-features">added an M2 Pro chip to the Mac Mini</a>.
