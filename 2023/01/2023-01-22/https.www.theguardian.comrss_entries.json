Is it too elitist or too populist? Should it showcase music or include drama, poetry and debate too? Does it \u201csuperserve\u201d an elderly, upmarket, predominantly white audience in the south of England? Is it a shrine to the past or a beacon to the future?<br /><br />These arguments have rumbled on for decades, and will fill the in-tray of Radio 3\u2019s new \u201ccontroller\u201d, to use the corporation\u2019s time-honoured but now rather fusty job title. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/mediacentre/2023/sam-jackson-new-bbc-radio3-controller\">Sam Jackson</a> is a former managing editor of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/06/classic-fm-25th-anniversay-john-suchet-sam-jackson\">Classic FM </a>and Smooth Radio, but the anti-populists should relax \u2013 that won\u2019t mean wall-to-wall ambient music on Radio 3. \u201cRadio 3 is unlike any other station: a network delivering ambitious, unique content, with live classical music at its core,\u201d Mr Jackson insists. <br /><br />The station\u2019s aficionados may be few in number, but they are remarkably sharp-elbowed and would storm Broadcasting House if there was any sign of drivetime-style dumbing down. That phrase \u201cdumbing down\u201d has been the bugbear of controllers from Nicholas Kenyon in the early 1990s on. No one has ever properly defined what it means, and it has become a barrier to developing Radio 3 and growing its audience. Music critic and commentator <a href=\"https://www.normanlebrecht.com/\">Norman Lebrecht</a> has argued that Mr Jackson\u2019s predecessor, Alan Davey, oversaw \u201ceight years of <a href=\"https://slippedisc.com/2022/09/just-in-bbc-drops-head-of-classical-music/\">dumbing down\u201d</a> during his tenure, but that is unfair. Mr Davey kept the ship afloat at a time of financial stringency and the marginalisation of classical music within British cultural life. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/21/were-too-darned-modest-about-we-do-radio-3-boss-alan-daveys-typical-day\">wanted to create </a>a station that thrived on ideas and discussion, but faced pushback from colleagues within the BBC who thought that would make it too similar to Radio 4.<br /><br />Mr Jackson\u2019s appointment has been largely welcomed, though having another white male as controller \u2013 the latest in an unbroken line since the Third Programme morphed into Radio 3 in 1967 \u2013 reportedly <a href=\"https://slippedisc.com/2023/01/breaking-bbc-radio-3s-new-controller-is/\">caused some anguish</a> at the BBC. He arrives at a time of instability at the station. Budgets are shrinking and Radio 3 is vulnerable because its cost-per-listener is so high. Broadcasting concerts, running orchestras and choirs, and putting on the Proms are expensive \u2013 \u00a360m a year, five times more than Radio 6 Music, which attracts 2.5 million listeners a week. Radio 3 suffered a startling fall in listenership in <a href=\"https://www.rajar.co.uk/docs/2022_09/National%20Stations%20Q3%202022%20-%20Clean.pdf\">the most recent quarter</a>, and if that is repeated this year it really will be in trouble. The planned move of more of the station\u2019s staff, including the entire leadership team, <a href=\"https://radiotoday.co.uk/2021/03/more-bbc-radio-stations-to-relocate-out-of-london/\">to Salford </a>as part of the ongoing \u201clevelling up\u201d of the BBC is also causing turbulence.<br /><br />Poisoned chalice or an opportunity for Mr Jackson to bring a fresh vision to the BBC\u2019s cultural standard-bearer? At a time when the Arts Council\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/19/england-opera-cutting-funding-eno-levelling-up\">tin-eared approach to opera</a> has reduced the sector to a mixture of rage and impotence, with music education <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/22/the-guardian-view-on-music-education-not-an-optional-extra\">more undervalued</a> than ever, despite evidence of its <a href=\"https://nafme.org/excitement-equity-exploration-music-education-in-finland/\">benefits in other countries</a>, and with the BBC itself <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/01/the-guardian-view-on-the-bbc-more-important-than-ever\">under assault</a>, the UK needs Radio 3 to be flourishing, confident and agenda-setting. Definitely beacon rather than museum. The station\u2019s new controller will be judged on whether he can renew its sense of purpose, and appeal to an audience with no interest in tired old cliches about dumbing down. What matters in music \u2013 and culture generally \u2013 is not the division between pop and posh, but between good and bad, inspired and insipid.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/22/the-guardian-view-on-radio-3s-new-leader-a-tough-challenge-ahead\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-UK", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/22/manchester-police-appeal-for-information-a-year-after-killing-of-kennie-carter", "title": "Fresh appeal and reward posted on anniversary of death of Kennie Carter, 16", "date_published": "2023-01-22 17:57:56+00:00", "description": "<p>Parents of boy stabbed in Manchester urge people to \u2018do the right thing\u2019 as police offer \u00a350,000 reward</p><p>The parents of a 16-year-old boy who was stabbed to death in Manchester have urged anyone with information to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d as police announced a \u00a350,000 reward on the anniversary of his killing.</p><p>Joan Dixon and Glen Carter said they \u201ccan\u2019t move on\u201d until the person who stabbed \u201ccheeky chappy\u201d Kennie Carter on 22 January last year is brought to justice.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/22/manchester-police-appeal-for-information-a-year-after-killing-of-kennie-carter\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-UK", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2023/jan/22/us-womens-marches-50th-anniversary-roe-v-wade-live", "title": "Women\u2019s marches take place across country on 50th anniversary of Roe v Wade \u2013 live", "date_published": "2023-01-22 17:49:18+00:00", "description": "<p>More than 200 events in 46 states to protest supreme court decision that struck down the federal right to an abortion in US</p><p>Hello Guardian live blog readers, we are currently covering several developing news events and this blog is going to keep you appraised on the women\u2019s march now underway in Washington, DC, and some other places in the US. </p><p>And US vice president Kamala Harris is speaking in Tallahassee, Florida, in a major speech to mark what would have been the 50th anniversary of the Roe v Wade decision by the US Supreme Court in 1973 that afforded the federal right to an abortion in America.</p><p><strong>At more than 200 Women\u2019s March events</strong> in 46 states, demonstrators are lamenting the Supreme Court\u2019s decision that now leaves it to individual states to decide on whether to make abortion legal for themselves.

In isolation, a \u201cthinking of me?\u201d text with a kissing face emoji, or the way he drapes his arm over her like a cape, or his chiding to raise her professional ambitions, could seem like affection.

Simon never hits her, a point which Alice uses to discount the seriousness of her situation to her two best friends. \u201cBut he doesn\u2019t hurt me though,\u201d she insists to Tess and Sophie (Wunmi Mosaku), who too slowly realize the extent to which Simon\u2019s yawning insecurities and possessiveness have erased Alice\u2019s sense of self and autonomy. The film smartly prioritizes effect over cause, resisting the trap of litigating just how toxic Simon\u2019s behavior was nor the escape hatch of \u201cit wasn\u2019t that bad.\u201d We see snippets of his manipulations but mostly how it manifests in Alice: the way she obsessively buffs her body into near hairlessness, recites ominous facts about sugar, rehearses a lie about seeing her friends to escape his judgement, treats sex as responsibility rather than pleasure. The way she expunges a flirty waiter\u2019s number from a napkin like she\u2019s bleaching blood, lest Simon find it in the trash can.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/22/alice-darling-showing-emotional-abuse-on-screen\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-UK", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/22/ageing-planet-the-new-demographic-timebomb", "title": "Ageing planet: the new demographic timebomb", "date_published": "2023-01-22 09:00:34+00:00", "description": "<p>India is about to overtake China as the most populous country, but as birthrates fall we\u2019re facing life in a greyer world.

That could of course mean drinking fewer glasses of your usual tipple, but it could also mean finding wines that have significantly lower alcohol in the first place. There are plenty of lighter wines that pre-date the current no-low fashions: wines that have lower alcohol as a function of the conditions and grape varieties and the stylistic ambitions of the winemaker rather than any conscious effort to reduce the abv. Wines such as that great burst of sweetly muscat-grapey frothy joy that is Moscato d\u2019Asti from Piedmont in northwest Italy, as exquisitely represented here by Ceretto\u2019s ebullient 5.5% abv example.</p><p><strong>Tesco Finest Steep Slopes Riesling QbA, Mosel, Germany 2021 (\u00a37, <a href=\"https://www.tesco.com/\">Tesco</a>) </strong>Another classic region that has long specialized in naturally low-alcohol wines is the Mosel Valley in Germany. This is riesling country, and it\u2019s that variety\u2019s naturally steely acidity that makes a light and technically off-dry wine such as Moselland Riesling Kabinett 2021 (\u00a310.95, <a href=\"http://tanners-wines.co.uk/\">tanners-wines.co.uk</a>) \u201cfeel\u201d dry in the mouth \u2013 the acidity \u201cdisguises\u201d the sugar so that you don\u2019t really notice the sweetness, just the succulent stone fruit and the refreshing lively feel. The wine has presence enough to feel as if it has more than its 8% alcohol, too, and that barely perceptible sugar is actually very good for matching with dishes with a little chilli spice. Over the past couple of decades, the fashion in Mosel and other regions of Germany is to ferment more of the natural sugar into alcohol and make drier styles. But even these are scarcely heavyweights in the alcohol department: Tesco\u2019s great value Steep Slopes with its lime-candy raciness clocks in at a relatively modest 11.5% abv.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/22/great-wines-to-make-the-most-of-damp-january\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-UK", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/22/ask-philippa-perry-im-single-about-to-turn-40-and-fear-i-will-self-destruct", "title": "I\u2019m single, about to turn 40 \u2013 and fear I will self-destruct | Ask Philippa", "date_published": "2023-01-22 06:00:28+00:00", "description": "<p>You\u2019re successful and do control and logic well \u2013 but it\u2019s time to dare yourself dream and listen to your body</p><p><em><strong>The dilemma </strong>Although I only look about 30, I am about to turn 40 and I am worried I am going to self-destruct.
