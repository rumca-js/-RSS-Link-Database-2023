Even people whose wrists are\nfine would benefit from trying it out:\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p>It can be about as fast as typing on a real keyboard, which is\ngreat on a phone. I'm very good at swiping, but I can dictate\nfaster.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>On Android, at least, it does a good job even in noisy\nenvironments as long as I hold the phone close to my mouth. I can also\nspeak very fast, faster than I can compose my thoughts, and it will\nstill understand me. It even understands whispering!\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>I like having it as an option for composing thoughts,\nespecially when I'm having trouble <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/focus\">focusing</a>. Sometimes it turns out I'm not in a good\nheadspace for typing ideas out, but talking them through out loud\nworks.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>If your wrists do start hurting someday, being able to easily\ngive them a break by switching some things to dictation can help them\nrecover faster and make you less likely to hurt yourself. I suspect if\nI had been used to dictating as needed in 2020, I wouldn't have gotten\nto where I had to stop typing for a couple years.\n\n</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nThere are some downsides, however:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p>The dictation built into Android isn't great with punctuation, and I\noften have to go back and fix things.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>The error rate, in general, is higher. For note taking or casual\ntexting where errors are no big deal this is less of an issue, but in\ndictating this post there were several places I needed to go back and\nfix something.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>Because mistranscriptions look more plausible than typos I'm\nmore likely to have errors that make it all the way through to\nposting: the mistakes are less likely to stand out as obviously wrong.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>Fixing dictation errors is a little more annoying than when typing\nbecause you have to switch modes.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>I like my dictated style slightly less than typed: it's just a bit\ntoo wordy. This makes it more important to go back over dictated posts\nlooking for things to cut.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>The dictation built into Mac isn't very good, and it's terrible\nunless I have a microphone <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/wired-headsets-for-video-calls\">right next to my\nmouth</a>. If I want to dictate longer things (ex: this post) I'll\ndictate them on my phone and then edit on the computer.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>I occasionally find myself saying \"comma\" or \"semicolon\" when\ntalking to people.\n\n</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nStill, I do think most people would benefit from trying it out,\nespecially on the phone.  It takes a little getting used to, but\nmostly you talk and it writes things down.  On Android it's just a\nmatter of tapping the little microphone on the on-screen keyboard:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/android-keyboard-button-for-dictation-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"983\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/android-keyboard-button-for-dictation.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid02NneXtotZ5uEPcQabCDuPR7Lp2S2MMufg82C8WhjR1Q5XV4pppM2yJaBFv6ktjEbel\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/109735290218614818\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}], "source": {"url": "https://www.jefftk.com/news.rss", "title": "Jeff Kaufmann"}}
