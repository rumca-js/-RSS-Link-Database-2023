<p>Protesters mark 50 years since landmark decision that protected abortion rights nationwide</p><p>Thousands of protesters gathered across the United States to protest the end of the federal right to abortion – marching on the the 50th anniversary of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/roe-v-wade">Roe v Wade</a> supreme court decision that made abortion a constitutional right in 1973, but which was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/24/roe-v-wade-overturned-abortion-summary-supreme-court">struck down</a> last year.</p><p>At more than 200 Women’s March events in 46 states, demonstrators condemned the court’s decision, which leaves it up to individual states to decide whether to protect, ban or restrict abortion rights.

<p>Presence of five English sides appears positive for Steve Borthwick but Warren Gatland may have more to smile about</p><p>The Six Nations is just around the corner and there is mounting evidence to suggest it will be even more cutthroat than ever. The Champions Cup is not a surefire guide to Six Nations supremacy but it is a timely gauge of the prevailing mood in certain nations. Some of this weekend’s results, not least, not least victories <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/20/leicester-ospreys-european-rugby-champions-cup-match-report-rugby-union">for Ospreys</a> and Edinburgh over Leicester and Saracens respectively, would suggest that cross-border margins continue to shrink.</p><p>At first glance the presence of five English sides, three apiece from Ireland, France and South Africa and one each from Wales and Scotland in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/european-rugby-champions-cup">Champions Cup</a> last 16 might seem encouraging for the new England head coach Steve Borthwick, who will be keen to see plenty of English-qualified players contesting big games for their clubs in early April.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/22/composition-of-champions-cup-last-16-offers-clues-to-six-nations-supremacy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Dramatist and screenwriter whose best-known stage play, Alpha Beta, is a scorching study of marriage and morality</p><p>As a passionate lover of football, in particular of Liverpool FC, Ted Whitehead, who has died aged 89, would have readily admitted that his career as a writer was a game of two halves. In the first, under the name EA Whitehead, he was an admired stage dramatist who wrote a number of scorching studies of the sex war for the Royal Court theatre including, in 1972, Alpha Beta starring <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/08/albert-finney-obituary">Albert Finney</a> and Rachel Roberts. In the second half he became a prolific writer of TV drama whose output included adaptations of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/04/fay-weldon-obituary">Fay Weldon</a>’s The Life and Loves of a She-Devil and The Cloning of Joanna May, as well as contributions to long-running series such as Cracker.</p><p>While brilliantly acted by Finney and Roberts, Alpha Beta went beyond the study of two trapped individuals to offer a critique of working-class morality, western European monogamy and the restrictive influence of Catholic dogma. Perhaps confirming DH Lawrence’s argument that marriage is more of a duel than a duet, the play showed its lasting power when revived by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/jun/26/alpha-beta-review-as-shocking-as-anything-on-the-london-stage">Finborough theatre in 2015</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jan/22/ted-whitehead-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It was a game to evoke memories of the time when these two clubs had a rivalry that defined English football as well as the destination of the Premier League title; a shuddering collision that was surely the best watch of the season so far.</p><p>Roy Keane in the tunnel; Keown versus Van Nistelrooy; brawls; flying pizza. It all felt like a part of it again because, for the first time in a long while, the fixture had a relevance to the championship race. As it always was, it was incident filled from first to last, tackles flying, tempers flaring. And, when it was all over, Arsenal had taken an adrenaline-fuelled step towards their first title since 2004.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/22/arsenal-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## Eileen review – Anne Hathaway transfixes in off-kilter thriller

<p><strong>Sundance film festival:</strong> the Oscar winner gives a pitch-perfect turn in an adaptation of Ottessa Moshfegh’s hit novel that doesn’t push its weirdness far enough</p><p>There’s a fantastically well-measured performance from Anne Hathaway in the strange, if not quite strange enough, thriller Eileen, an adaptation of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/01/eileen-ottessa-moshfegh-review-random-act-violence">Ottessa Moshfegh’s Booker prize-shortlisted novel</a>. She’s an actor who doesn’t always find her sweet spot, admirably trying to show extensive range for a star of her high wattage, yet often not proving to be the right match for her material, big swings frustratingly filed away as big misses.</p><p>Hathaway has an outsized energy that can jar with roles that require a performer who can more convincingly, quietly disappear, and so in Eileen, where her character Rebecca is exploding into the drab world of 1960s Massachusetts as a glamorous, and potentially dangerous, bombshell, it’s a match-up that feels like kismet. Her arrival is a ground-shifter for bored 24-year-old Eileen (Thomasin McKenzie) whose life consists of caring for her cruel alcoholic father (a horribly believable Shea Wigham, a sterling character actor long overdue for more attention), controlling her sexual desire and working a thankless job as a secretary at a juvenile facility. When Rebecca joins the staff as a psychologist, Eileen, like the men surrounding her, is unable to stop staring, a sudden flash of colour in an otherwise muted world.</p><p>Eileen premiered at the Sundance film festival and is seeking distribution</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/22/eileen-review-anne-hathaway-thriller-sundance-film-festival">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Last week’s decision not to commit western tanks against Russia will be seen in Moscow as proof of European weakness</p><p>As Sherlock Holmes once pointed out, something that does not happen can be as significant as something that does. Friday’s meeting of defence ministers at Ramstein in Germany had been billed as the moment when the western allies, Germany above all, would finally commit the battle tanks that Ukraine has been demanding. It didn’t happen. As our own <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/20/ukraine-germany-leopard-2-tanks-ramstein">weekend report</a> delicately expressed it, Germany declined to take a decision.</p><p>Although tanks dominated the headlines, a lot of military <a href="https://www.ifw-kiel.de/publications/kiel-working-papers/2022/the-ukraine-support-tracker-which-countries-help-ukraine-and-how-17204/">commitments</a> came out of Ramstein. A US package, worth $2.5bn, includes fighting vehicles, air defence and rockets. Nine other allies gave more support, too, including tanks from the UK. These are the latest steps in the gradual extension of western military support and hardening of attitudes. They are a recognition that the spring will be decisive and that Ramstein will shape the military outcome.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/22/the-guardian-view-on-germany-and-ukraine-a-fateful-hesitation">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on Radio 3’s new leader: a tough challenge ahead | Editorial

<p>Besieged by cuts, falling audiences and rows about ‘dumbing down’, BBC radio’s classical music flagship is small but still vitally important</p><p>Radio 3 is a relatively small station – 1.7 million weekly listeners, just <a href="https://www.rajar.co.uk/listening/quarterly_listening.php">3% of the UK adult population</a>, at the last count – but it generates big arguments. Is it too elitist or too populist? Should it showcase music or include drama, poetry and debate too? Does it “superserve” an elderly, upmarket, predominantly white audience in the south of England? Is it a shrine to the past or a beacon to the future?<br /><br />These arguments have rumbled on for decades, and will fill the in-tray of Radio 3’s new “controller”, to use the corporation’s time-honoured but now rather fusty job title. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/mediacentre/2023/sam-jackson-new-bbc-radio3-controller">Sam Jackson</a> is a former managing editor of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/06/classic-fm-25th-anniversay-john-suchet-sam-jackson">Classic FM </a>and Smooth Radio, but the anti-populists should relax – that won’t mean wall-to-wall ambient music on Radio 3. “Radio 3 is unlike any other station: a network delivering ambitious, unique content, with live classical music at its core,” Mr Jackson insists. <br /><br />The station’s aficionados may be few in number, but they are remarkably sharp-elbowed and would storm Broadcasting House if there was any sign of drivetime-style dumbing down. That phrase “dumbing down” has been the bugbear of controllers from Nicholas Kenyon in the early 1990s on. No one has ever properly defined what it means, and it has become a barrier to developing Radio 3 and growing its audience. Music critic and commentator <a href="https://www.normanlebrecht.com/">Norman Lebrecht</a> has argued that Mr Jackson’s predecessor, Alan Davey, oversaw “eight years of <a href="https://slippedisc.com/2022/09/just-in-bbc-drops-head-of-classical-music/">dumbing down”</a> during his tenure, but that is unfair. Mr Davey kept the ship afloat at a time of financial stringency and the marginalisation of classical music within British cultural life. He <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/21/were-too-darned-modest-about-we-do-radio-3-boss-alan-daveys-typical-day">wanted to create </a>a station that thrived on ideas and discussion, but faced pushback from colleagues within the BBC who thought that would make it too similar to Radio 4.<br /><br />Mr Jackson’s appointment has been largely welcomed, though having another white male as controller – the latest in an unbroken line since the Third Programme morphed into Radio 3 in 1967 – reportedly <a href="https://slippedisc.com/2023/01/breaking-bbc-radio-3s-new-controller-is/">caused some anguish</a> at the BBC. He arrives at a time of instability at the station. Budgets are shrinking and Radio 3 is vulnerable because its cost-per-listener is so high. Broadcasting concerts, running orchestras and choirs, and putting on the Proms are expensive – £60m a year, five times more than Radio 6 Music, which attracts 2.5 million listeners a week. Radio 3 suffered a startling fall in listenership in <a href="https://www.rajar.co.uk/docs/2022_09/National%20Stations%20Q3%202022%20-%20Clean.pdf">the most recent quarter</a>, and if that is repeated this year it really will be in trouble. The planned move of more of the station’s staff, including the entire leadership team, <a href="https://radiotoday.co.uk/2021/03/more-bbc-radio-stations-to-relocate-out-of-london/">to Salford </a>as part of the ongoing “levelling up” of the BBC is also causing turbulence.<br /><br />Poisoned chalice or an opportunity for Mr Jackson to bring a fresh vision to the BBC’s cultural standard-bearer? At a time when the Arts Council’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/19/england-opera-cutting-funding-eno-levelling-up">tin-eared approach to opera</a> has reduced the sector to a mixture of rage and impotence, with music education <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/22/the-guardian-view-on-music-education-not-an-optional-extra">more undervalued</a> than ever, despite evidence of its <a href="https://nafme.org/excitement-equity-exploration-music-education-in-finland/">benefits in other countries</a>, and with the BBC itself <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/01/the-guardian-view-on-the-bbc-more-important-than-ever">under assault</a>, the UK needs Radio 3 to be flourishing, confident and agenda-setting. Definitely beacon rather than museum. The station’s new controller will be judged on whether he can renew its sense of purpose, and appeal to an audience with no interest in tired old cliches about dumbing down. What matters in music – and culture generally – is not the division between pop and posh, but between good and bad, inspired and insipid.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/22/the-guardian-view-on-radio-3s-new-leader-a-tough-challenge-ahead">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Sundance film festival:</strong> We Are Lady Parts creator Nida Manzoor’s initially refreshing film follows two sisters torn apart by impending marriage but a big swing is taken that sinks what follows</p><p>Polite Society, the feature debut from British writer-director Nida Manzoor, traffics in several familiar lanes: the coming-of-age high school comedy, a Bollywood movie, the light gravity-bending and slo-mo shots of a martial arts flick. Its particular flavor, however, is immediately distinctive and winning – at least at first. The 104-minute film from the creator of the TV series We Are Lady Parts has one of the most refreshing first halves of a comedy that I’ve seen, with a promising set-up: genuine sibling concern over what an older sister’s engagement means for their bond and creative dreams, crossed with a teenage girl’s capacity for self-centered fantasies.</p><p>The younger sister in question is Ria Khan, played by delightful newcomer Priya Kansara, a London-based Pakistani Muslim girl who dreams of becoming one of Britain’s top stuntwoman (in one of the film’s more successful bits, Priya’s unanswered feelings-dump emails to Britain’s actual top stuntwoman double as both voiceover and diary.) She’s close to Lena (Umbrella Academy’s Ritu Arya) in the spiky, secret-language way of two sisters against the world – Lena, recently returned home after dropping out of art school, will protest and spar with Ria but ultimately still films the amateur stunt videos for Ria’s YouTube channel, to the gentle chagrin of their more traditional career-seeking parents (Shobu Kapoor and Jeff Mirza).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/22/polite-society-review-sundance">Continue reading...</a>

While <em><a href="https://themurdercapital.lnk.to/gigisrecovery">Gigi’s Recovery</a></em> isn’t always bursting with the joys of spring – a first draft was rejected for being “fucking depressing” – it extends their post-punk palette brilliantly beyond the monochrome grief and pain of their 2019 debut. Piercing the gothic gloom are new textures that broaden and deepen their sound, hinting at the big music of U2 and Simple Minds without losing the youthful, bug-eyed intensity that’s long abandoned those bands.</p><p>Ethel and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NQddPqfIpI">Return My Head</a> are the pick of the singles, fizzing, constantly promising something very exciting is about to happen, then delivering. James McGovern’s aching croon comes into its own on quieter moments such as love ballad Belonging, while the band tilt at new standards of excellence with grandly reflective The Lie Becomes the Self and the huge, indelible title track. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/22/the-capital-gigis-recovery-review-superlative-downbeat-rock-thrills-ethel-return-my-head">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From haunted dolls to horror films, there is a big appetite right now for fear-as-fun.

Rebekkah Sexual Spirit (“her vessel is missing an arm … she says she does not care”) has been snapped up, but you can get Maggie (“NOT A TOY”; “a vast mass of dark energy”; “can make you feel very unwell” – all of which sounds like me on an average Tuesday) for £225. You know the kind: horror movie trope dolls with smooth porcelain faces and blank eyes – absolutely terrifying. The first one startled me so much I twitched, accidentally clicked “buy” and had to carefully navigate backwards to save myself. Then I went back and looked at more.</p><p>Why? They gave me that prickly, uncomfortable feeling: nasty but compelling. I’m not a thrill-seeker (except the thrill of racing the bin out as the lorry rounds the corner), but I’ve become quite enamoured of creepy recently.

## ‘To hell with being sweet and affable’: Leila Farzad on acting, pain and speaking her mind

<p>After years of waiting impatiently in the wings, Leila Farzad has finally landed her first starring role – a ‘callous and cold’ police officer. Here, she talks about Iranian pride, PMT and what she owes I Hate Suzie</p><p>In the television show <em>I Hate Suzie</em>, Leila Farzad’s character, Naomi, argues the life-changing benefits of PMT. It’s the moment of Permanent Mega Truth, she says – a brief window every month when a woman’s real feelings are revealed. The stoic veil lifts. Huge problems become clear. We realise we must leave our job or relationship. Or… we wait for it to pass and go back to pretending everything is fine.</p><p><em>I Hate Suzie</em> is a brutal, funny, raw series, starring and co-created by Billie Piper, about a celebrity whose life is upended when her phone is hacked. (Photos of her having sex with a man who isn’t her husband appear online. Everything falls apart.) Farzad’s big break came when she was cast in the role of Piper’s agent. When I tell her I think of the PMT line regularly – at least once a month – she grins. “I’m there right now,” she says. She closes her eyes and sighs, as if she’s just opened a meditation app. “I’m sweating, I’m not sleeping, my sense of smell is heightened. The smell of my cat’s diarrhoea was so bad it literally woke me from my sleep,” she laughs. She tells me she’s an overs-sharer, though she doesn’t need to; she freely lists the symptoms of her polycystic ovary syndrome and bends her arms backwards to demonstrate the hypermobility that means she’s banned from performing yoga. There’s the daily battles of her raging IBS, too. Ah, a comrade. I tell her I have Buscopan, the antispasmodic IBS relief medicine, in my bag. I’ve uttered the secret password of our people. She nods, knowingly. “You get it. Never trust a fart.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/22/leila-farzad-on-acting-pain-and-speaking-her-mind-better">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As the domain of human potential is staked by the powerful older, it’s not unreasonable to imagine beauty standards may one day shift too</p><p>Is the modern mind out of step with the modern pace of ageing? Two recent incidents – one personal and one as glittery as Hollywood’s award season – provoke consideration of such a question.</p><p>In the first; a middle-aged acquaintance is alarming friends with his accelerating attempts to youthify. He<strong> </strong>recently got a little Botox jab to iron out an ageing wrinkle between the eyes. This received many compliments, but then<strong> </strong>came a touch-up of some crow’s feet that were bothering him. After that was some jaw sculpting, because the temptation to erase the weathering of his features was not reduced by his procedures but encouraged by them. Now he’s had something done to his nose, and his mouth, and added dental veneers. Compliments have been replaced with public silence and private fraught concern.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/23/the-fetishisation-of-youth-might-be-undergoing-a-makeover-when-has-ageing-ever-looked-this-fun">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Royal Academy, London</strong><br />The pick of Manhattan’s Hispanic Society Museum &amp; Library, including masterpieces by Goya, El Greco and Velázquez, have been loaned to the UK for an unmissable show</p><p>Halfway through this magnificent exhibition hangs a portrait by Goya so famous it has its own nickname – <em>The Black Duchess</em>. It shows a fiercely intelligent woman standing outdoors in a romantic landscape dressed in crackling black lace. Her eyes flash, her sash blazes scarlet, the yellow and gold of her bodice burn like flames through the lace.</p><p>The Duchess of Alba is as beautiful as she is haughty. One hand on hip, she points down with the other to some words written in the sand beneath her feet. Solo Goya – Only Goya. Is it a pledge of love, or an imperious summons, as if the artist should kneel before her? He puts himself, and us, on eye level with her gilded slippers. The duchess was his patron and friend, and perhaps more. What the portrait – and its subject – meant to him may remain forever undisclosed but Goya never let the painting go. It was with him until his death.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jan/22/spain-and-the-hispanic-world-review-royal-academy-london-hispanic-society-museum-and-library-new-york-treasure-trove-takes-a-trip-goya-el-greco-velazquez">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Ustinov Studio, Theatre Royal Bath<br /></strong>The Hollywood star is on top form opposite Dougray Scott in Edward Albee’s classic tale of a marriage gone sour</p><p>Edward Albee’s first short play, <em>The</em> <em>Zoo Story</em>, premiered in Germany in a double bill with Samuel Beckett’s <em>Krapp’s Last Tape</em> in 1959. Albee admired Beckett and shared his taste for the absurd, along with a love of music hall and vaudeville. <em><a href="https://www.theatreroyal.org.uk/event/whos-afraid-of-virginia-woolf/">Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</a></em> is a grotesque expansion of the familiar comic double act, given an absurdist twist and pummelled to fit a classic, naturalistic set-up: the unfulfilled marriage. Director Lindsay Posner deploys these influences effectively through the dynamics of the play, especially via the rhythms of the dialogue (even though, on a pre-press night, tempos occasionally faltered).</p><p>George and Martha have finessed their patter over 23 lacerating years of wedded blistering. Their young guests, Nick and Honey, become the unwitting fall guys to the older couple’s private routines, and unwilling audience to an excoriating exposition of a relationship in which love is indistinguishable from hate. As their early-hours, alcohol-fuelled encounter develops, though, the boundaries between the couples become blurred. Are Nick and Honey the image of what George and Martha once were? Are George and Martha are the prediction of what Nick and Honey will become or, terrifyingly, of what any of us might become if we settle for a life based on illusions?</p><p><a href="https://www.theatreroyal.org.uk/event/whos-afraid-of-virginia-woolf/">At the Ustinov Studio, Theatre Royal Bath until 11 February</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jan/22/whos-afraid-of-virginia-woolf-ustinov-studio-theatre-royal-bath-review-elizabeth-mcgovern-cracks-the-whip-dougray-scott-lindsay-posner">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Until last year, Roe made it more possible for women’s lives to be determined by their choices, not merely by their bodies</p><p>If the supreme court hadn’t overturned it last June, undoing a longstanding precedent and inflicting untold harm to women’s well-being and dignity, Sunday 22 January would have been the fiftieth anniversary of Roe v Wade.</p><p>Over those 50 years, Roe changed American life dramatically. Abortion became a routine part of life, a resource people planned their lives around having. In contrast to its political controversy, abortion in the Roe era was – as it is now – aggressively common.

<p>On the 20th anniversary of his bestseller, Nigel Slater tells how it all began … and how it went to stage and screen</p><p>Toast is 20. But the memoir that chronicled my childhood (cooking, eating, crying, and a few other “ings” a wiser author might have left out) started life as neither book, film nor stage play, but as an article in the <em>Observer</em>.</p><p>I was unsure about the idea. A request for a piece about the food I had grown up with. Did my editor know that my childhood had been a catalogue of sliced white bread, Jacobs’ Cream Crackers and Sugar Puffs? That I refused to eat any meat that wasn’t roast chicken or a lamb chop and any vegetable save frozen peas? I pondered how a story whose gastronomic highlights were arctic roll and butterscotch Angel Delight would go down with the readers. Surely the food of my father’s childhood, where his broke single mum brought him up on bread and dripping and soup made from bones begged from the butcher, might produce a better story.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/22/nigel-slater-how-his-memoir-toast-became-a-phenomenon">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I felt like a failure because I found breastfeeding so painful but visual art helped me make sense of my experience</p><p>Mythical mothers, divine mothers and royal mothers. Ancient clay statuettes of pregnant women and contemporary explorations of birth. As an art historian of 20 years, I’ve seen a lot of representations of motherhood. And from Renoir’s wholesome portraits of his wife nursing their son to countless versions of the Madonna and Child, many of these images depicted blissful breastfeeding scenes. A few years ago, with my new baby asleep on my chest and unable to relax into sleep myself, I began obsessively searching for historical fragments of mothering lives – because I felt as if I was failing and needed something to tether myself to.</p><p>When I decided to get pregnant, I already knew I wanted to breastfeed. Other parents decide it’s not for them – a decision I respect now more than ever – but it was how I pictured my motherhood. I carried these idealised artistic representations of breastfeeding with me into antenatal classes, where I watched a woman hold a doll to a knitted boob and made notes on the best feeding positions. In these classes, we were never told about formula milk or preparing bottles or about how we might feel if our feeding hopes didn’t go as planned.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/22/when-i-struggled-with-breastfeeding-ancient-images-of-motherhood-helped-me-feel-less-isolated">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A golden onion soup and a luxurious couscous dish to warm the soul in the bleak midwinter</p><p>I usually take my time cooking onions, leaving them to do their thing in oil or butter until they are soft and golden. Not a task to hurry if you want them truly sweet and amber-hued. This week I needed to cook them differently – soft enough to crush between finger and thumb, but not browned – for a pale and calming soup to enjoy on a cold day.</p><p>I sliced the onions and added them to the pan with celery and leafy twigs of thyme and bay. The heat was kept at a moderate level and the onions and aromatics puttered away quietly, cooking at a whisper rather than a sizzle. They were stirred every 5 minutes or so, their edges taking on the palest yellow colour without a hint of brown. The strong onion notes were softened further with a little cream, then given a smoky note with speck, torn into thick ribbons to dunk into the ivory depths of the soup.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/22/nigel-slaters-recipes-for-cream-of-onion-soup-and-clementine-and-lemon-tarts">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Almeida; Donmar Warehouse, London<br /></strong>Paul Mescal, Patsy Ferran and Anjana Vasan captivate in Rebecca Frecknall’s headlong take on Tennessee Williams. And Lillian Hellman’s 1941 call to arms resonates anew</p><p>This <em>Streetcar</em> is transporting. The casting of Rebecca Frecknall’s production guaranteed <a href="https://almeida.co.uk/whats-on/a-streetcar-named-desire/10-dec-2022-4-feb-2023#open-calendar">a sellout</a>, and has produced three bewitching performances: Paul Mescal in the part that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/jul/04/features.review1">Brando</a> and his T-shirt played in the 1951 movie, alongside Patsy Ferran, stepping in late for an injured <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/dec/08/almeida-theatre-cancels-performances-of-a-streetcar-named-desire-as-actor-withdraws">Lydia Wilson</a>, as Blanche, and Anjana Vasan as sister Stella. Yet the central triumph is Frecknall’s ability to find the pulse of Tennessee Williams’s 1947 play. Confusion and desire are not embodied in a single performance: they sweep the stage, pushing the action along.</p><p>Frecknall has been most acclaimed for her massive production of <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/dec/19/cabaret-playhouse-review-eddie-redmayne-jessie-buckley-best-of-enemies-young-vic-james-graham-trouble-in-mind-national-theatre">Cabaret</a> </em>(still running at the Playhouse).

<p>The chair of the Conservative party has had to cough up millions of pounds he owed in tax after a dispute with HMRC over an offshore family trust</p><p>I was extremely surprised last week to learn that the Tory chair, Nadhim Zahawi, who famously <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/10/nadhim-zahawi-admits-taxpayers-electricity-stables">used public money to warm the stables of his chilly horses</a>, had finally tasted the fist of justice. Last year, Zahawi said: “I’ve always declared my financial interests and paid my taxes in the UK.” In fact, it seems, Zahawi has had to cough up millions of pounds he owed in tax after a dispute with HMRC over an offshore family trust. Last week, his spokesperson said of his boss: “He is proud to have built a British business that has become successful around the world.” The spokesperson said this when asked whether Zahawi was paying millions to HM Revenue and Customs. The answer is the answer to a different question, a British question admittedly, but one that was not asked.</p><p>When asked a question, politicians, you can’t just say any words as a reply. There has to be some relationship. Is it any wonder examination standards declined so sharply when Zahawi was education secretary. “Explain how Adolf Hitler justified the annexation of the Sudetenland.” “Sartana is coming so trade your pistols for a coffin.” Will that do?</p><p>Stewart Lee’s shows <em>Snowflake</em> and <em>Tornado</em> are available <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m001bvpn/stewart-lee">on BBC iPlayer</a>. <em><a href="https://www.stewartlee.co.uk/live-dates/">Basic Lee</a></em><a href="https://www.stewartlee.co.uk/live-dates/"> tour dates are booking now</a>.

The blessing also came as a responsibility after my mother died [in 2010]. There was a vacuum created by a great artist who had taken up a lot of room in my life, for better or worse.

## Alice, Darling and the importance of showing emotional abuse on screen

<p>The new film starring Anna Kendrick is one of the few visual narratives to deftly handle the insidious effects of an emotionally abusive relationship</p><p>If not guided by an ominous score and a remarkable lead performance of brittle, jittery anxiety, it might take you a third of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/sep/12/alice-darling-review-anna-kendrick-drama">Alice, Darling</a>, a new film starring Anna Kendrick as a woman in an emotionally abusive relationship, to realize something is wrong. Alice’s relationship with Simon (Charlie Carrick), a thirtysomething Toronto-based artist with a suave British accent, could seem innocuous on a clue-by-clue basis. In isolation, a “thinking of me?” text with a kissing face emoji, or the way he drapes his arm over her like a cape, or his chiding to raise her professional ambitions, could seem like affection. The tell is in Alice’s frayed hair – barrel-curled into, as her friend Tess (Kaniehtiio Horn) puts it, an outdated Gossip Girl coif and, from the very first scene, nervously pulled into matted clumps.</p><p>Alice, Darling, directed by Mary Nighy from a script by Alanna Farris, is the rare film to depict the battering of the psyche, let alone one which deftly and accurately depicts the corrosive, insidious effect of coercive control absent the evidence of physical abuse. Simon never hits her, a point which Alice uses to discount the seriousness of her situation to her two best friends. “But he doesn’t hurt me though,” she insists to Tess and Sophie (Wunmi Mosaku), who too slowly realize the extent to which Simon’s yawning insecurities and possessiveness have erased Alice’s sense of self and autonomy. The film smartly prioritizes effect over cause, resisting the trap of litigating just how toxic Simon’s behavior was nor the escape hatch of “it wasn’t that bad.” We see snippets of his manipulations but mostly how it manifests in Alice: the way she obsessively buffs her body into near hairlessness, recites ominous facts about sugar, rehearses a lie about seeing her friends to escape his judgement, treats sex as responsibility rather than pleasure. The way she expunges a flirty waiter’s number from a napkin like she’s bleaching blood, lest Simon find it in the trash can.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/22/alice-darling-showing-emotional-abuse-on-screen">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The revered philosopher John Rawls had it right: most citizens believe that the government has an obligation to create a just society</p><p>In September 1931, 1,000 sailors in the British Atlantic fleet engaged in open revolt, refusing to put to sea from the port of Invergordon – one of the very few mutinies in our naval history. Sailors from all ranks were protesting against proposed general pay cuts of 10%, but also at the unfair decision to cut by 25% the wages of junior ratings and those joining after 1925 – part of the then National Government’s doomed attempt to deal with the Depression, balance the national budget and stay on the gold standard.</p><p>That attempt backfired spectacularly. The 25% cut might have been rescinded to get the fleet back to sea – even the admirals conceded that it was unfair – but international investors concluded that, after a decade of government efforts to force down real wages to make British business competitive, the limit had been reached. Britain could not compel its workforce into the financial straitjacket of ever lower real wages, imposed by trying to tie sterling to the price of gold. The run on the pound proved unstoppable. Five days later, Britain gave in to reality and was forced off the gold standard.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/22/this-attempt-to-cut-the-pay-of-public-servants-offends-a-basic-british-sense-of-fairness">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Growing plants without soil is easier than you think – and means you can appreciate the architecture of the roots. Here’s how…</p><p>Hydroponics is one of those growing techniques that seems to be capturing people’s imagination at the moment – fuelled perhaps by the slew of CGI images showing futuristic vertical farms atop skyscrapers that are flooding social media these days. Fortunately, you don’t have to have an engineering degree or be the owner of a glass-covered penthouse to try this out for yourself. Here’s my beginner’s guide to home hydroponics.</p><p>This growing technique can be as simple or complicated as you want it to be, but at its heart is the basic fact that plants do not need soil to grow. In fact, generally speaking, all that soil provides for plants is a source of moisture, air and minerals – roughly in that order. Dispensing with soil means you can grow plants without any growing media whatsoever, in clear glass vases, orbs or bowls.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/22/time-to-dip-a-gardening-toe-into-quirky-hydroponics">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Research shows that working fewer hours can be far more productive. Richard Godwin clocks on to find out if it’s true</p><p>I have been meaning to write about the miracles of the four-day week for a while now. Ever since I started working a four-day week last August, in fact. This was prompted by a change in childcare arrangements (our two-year-old, Aubrey, started his own four-day week at nursery) and an upping of my wife’s work commitments. We all thought it best that I should take charge of him on Fridays. Having heard friends hymn their own four-day weeks (“It revolutionised Sundays,” said a friend who had taken Mondays off to look after his boys), I thought the arrangement would suit my right-on, pro-feminist, climate-conscious, kind-of-had-it-with-constant-deadlines sensibility rather well.</p><p>And indeed, our first Friday was a triumph. I acquired a child seat for my bike and we pedalled from Bristol to Bath and back in the late-summer sunshine, rehearsing the arguments from key post-capitalist works, such as <em>Inventing the Future</em> by Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams, and <em>Utopia for Realists</em> by Rutger Bregman, which posit less work as a solution to all manner of 21st-century ills.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/22/work-less-live-more-is-it-time-to-end-the-five-day-week">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The first and presumably last Briton ever to lead European foreign policy gives us a glimpse of an approach – more collaboration, less alpha male showboating – now sadly lost</p><p>In February 2014, Catherine Ashton flew to Kyiv to hold talks with Ukraine’s embattled president, Viktor Yanukovych. For four years, she had been the European Union’s top envoy. As its first ever high representative for foreign affairs and security, Ashton was used to dealing with crises. Her in-tray included Iran’s nuclear programme; a rumbling dispute between Serbia and Kosovo; and natural disasters around the world, from an earthquake in Haiti to the tsunami in Japan.</p><p>This one was precipitated by Yanukovych’s decision to pull out abruptly from an association agreement with the EU. It prompted thousands of protesters to set up camp in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/apr/08/architects-revolt-kiev-maidan-square-ukraine-insurrection">Maidan</a> – Independence Square – in the centre of Kyiv. They spent weeks demonstrating in the cold. Lurking in the background was a spectre: Russia. Or, more accurately, Vladimir Putin, a chilly and “unsmiling” leader with a “deep sense of grievance”. Over the years she got to know him well.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/22/and-then-what-by-catherine-ashton-review-colourful-insider-account-of-european-diplomacy">Continue reading...</a>

## Babylon review – Damien Chazelle’s messy, exhausting tale of early Hollywood

<p>Despite star wattage from Margot Robbie and Brad Pitt, ​the ​La La Land​ director’s ​overcooked portrait of a nascent Tinseltown is more hysterical than historical</p><p>In the opening act of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/07/damien-chazelle-first-man-interview-flag-donald-trump-la-la-land">Damien Chazelle</a>’s hyperventilating, splashboard portrait of early Hollywood, an elephant shits explosively straight on to the screen, covering us in a veritable sewage farm of sloppy excreta. Over the next three hours (believe me, it feels longer) we’ll be treated to a man chomping down on live rats in the bowels of hell, a giant alligator snapping at the heels of subterranean revellers to the monkey/chimp refrain of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aba_Daba_Honeymoon">Aba Daba Honeymoon</a>, and a rattlesnake sinking its fangs into Margot Robbie’s neck before having its head cut off with a knife. We’ll also get to watch an actor pee on a Fatty Arbuckle-style partygoer (“Playtime with potty time!”) and see Robbie projectile-vomiting all over someone’s nice suit, extravagantly despoiling a Klikó rug in the process. All this is delivered in shrieking, hyperactive tones that make Baz Luhrmann’s <em>Moulin Rouge!</em> look like one of the slower works of Hungarian auteur <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/may/26/bela-tarr-turin-horse">Béla Tarr</a>. Subtle it is not. Nor is it good.</p><p>The story (if that word can be used to describe a succession of over-choreographed set pieces strung together by interstitial date markers and bouts of screaming) follows silver-screen dreamers Manuel “Manny” Torres (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/13/babylon-breakout-star-diego-calva-i-owe-this-role-to-margot-robbie-something-happened-between-us">Diego Calva</a>) and Nellie LaRoy (Robbie) as they ascend the greasy pole to stardom in the foundational days of motion pictures. Nellie wants to become a star (“You don’t <em>become</em> a star, honey. You either are one or you aren’t”), while Manny longs to be in the movie-making business in <em>any </em>capacity, from shovelling shit at glitzy parties, to becoming a fixer for matinee idol Jack Conrad (Brad Pitt) and assuming uncertain positions at a studio (when asked if he’s “a producer”, he replies that he is an “<em>executive</em>”).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/22/babylon-review-damien-chazelle-margot-robbie-brad-pitt-messy-exhausting-tale-of-early-hollywood">Continue reading...</a>

<p>How to make the barely there look work for you. Plus, a great retinoid serum and lush hair treatments</p><p>Three weeks into January and applying makeup still feels laborious. Hence easy and natural is ideal. That said, “natural” is totally subjective; for some, natural is a full face of maquillage – contouring, powder, falsies, the works. For those with a minimalistic outlook, here’s the tip. A foundation or concealer that feels and – when applied – looks like skin, an elevated, grownup lip balm that you can use sans mirror, a mascara that gives you full, thick lashes in seconds (Sculpted by Aimee is phenomenal) and a highlighter to dot on your cheekbones so you don’t look as dull as January.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Byredo Lip Balm</strong> £40, <a href="https://www.cultbeauty.com/">cultbeauty.com</a> <br /><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Sisley Stylo correct Concealer</strong> £46, <a href="https://www.net-a-porter.com/en-gb/">net-a-porter.com</a><br /><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Lancôme Teint Idole Ultra Wear Care &amp; Glow Foundation</strong> £30, <a href="https://www.lancome.co.uk/">lancome.co.uk</a> <br /><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Rare Beauty Positive Light Silky touch Highlighter</strong> £28, <a href="https://www.sephora.co.uk/">sephora.co.uk</a> <br /><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Sculpted by Aimee My Mascara</strong> £17, <a href="https://sculptedbyaimee.co.uk/">sculptedbyaimee.co.uk</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jan/22/a-natural-look-to-brighten-winter-days">Continue reading...</a>

No, I am a person quite tied to dry land, and cosiness, and a lack of eels scraping my shins, but I applaud those who did it. Those brave enough to jump straight into lakes, whether for exercise, their mental health, their headaches or their Instagrams. You always knew who was a wild swimmer, because they would tell you, frequently. And I’d applaud until my palms stung, because this was a feat of endurance and bravery so far beyond my own pathetic limits that they might as well have jumped into an active volcano rather than the local pond.

<p>Three decades after his photographs of a family in Blackpool came to symbolise the deprivation of post-Thatcherite Britain, Craig Easton caught up with the now adult children</p><p>In 1992, <a href="https://www.craigeaston.com/">Craig Easton</a> was commissioned by the French newspaper <em>Libération</em> to take photographs to illustrate a story on the idea of the British “underclass” – what the Tories of the time called “something for nothing” society. Easton spent some time with Mandy and Mick Williams and their family in Blackpool. Mick had lost his job as a removals man and he and his wife and six children had subsisted for years on benefits in a temporary hostel. The pictures of the Williams children became emblematic of the deprivation of post-Thatcherite Britain.</p><p>Easton wondered over the years what became of the family. He first tried to track the children down in 2005 and eventually caught up with them a decade later, mostly still living in the north-west. Katrina, pictured here at her wedding reception in 2018, was four when Easton first photographed her with her siblings.

Here his deputy talks about continuing his fearless anti-corruption work – and why she won’t give up hope of his release</p><p>Two years ago this week, the leader of the Russian opposition, Alexei Navalny,<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/17/alexei-navalny-to-fly-into-moscow-in-challenge-to-putin"> flew into Moscow</a> knowing that he faced certain arrest and imprisonment. It was an extraordinary act of courage and leadership. He had only just recovered from an attempt on his life after collapsing on a plane poisoned with what was later found to be the nerve agent novichok.

<p>As Belarus’s democratically elected president is tried for treason in absentia, she demands deeper sanctions on the brutal regime</p><p>A show trial carries with it a noxious whiff of Soviet times and in the case of Belarus, a country trapped by its past, the allusion is wholly appropriate. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, elected president in 2020 in a contest stolen by Belarus’s dictator, Alexander Lukashenko, was accused of treason by a court in Minsk last week. Her <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/belarus-puts-exiled-opposition-leader-trial-treason-charges-2023-01-17/">trial is a sham</a> and a farce. The opposition leader is one among countless victims of an illegitimate rogue regime that oppresses its people and threatens the security of Europe.</p><p>Lukashenko, in power since 1994, has long been notorious for his authoritarian rule. But the situation has steadily deteriorated since the huge pro-democracy protests three years ago that nearly brought him down. Belarus now holds about 1,500 political prisoners. Tsikhanouskaya is not among them; she is being tried in absentia. But many others are less fortunate, including her husband, Sergei Tikhanovsky, whom she replaced as opposition leader after his arrest. He was later <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2021/12/14/sergei-tikhanovskaya-the-husband-of-belarus-opposition-leader-svetlana-given-18-year-jail-">jailed</a> for 18 years.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/22/observer-view-belarus-rogue-regime-relationship-russia">Continue reading...</a>

Words like “blunt” and “austere” are never likely to make hearts tremble. As if Climat should care. Only restaurants dependent on passing trade need worry about their lip-glossed looks, and right now nobody is coming here accidentally. Climat, open for only three weeks the night I visit, is every kind of hot. Manchester is a big bustling city, but faced by a new venture that everyone agrees is doing all the good things in all the right ways, it behaves like the sweetest kind of village.

## Great wines to make the most of ‘Damp’ January

<p>Many people have tried their hand at Dry January with mixed results, but lower-alcohol and lighter wines are also worth considering</p><p><strong>Ceretto Moscato d’Asti DOCG, Italy 2021 (from £18, <a href="http://harrogatefinewinecompany.com/">harrogatefinewinecompany.com</a>; <a href="http://heritagecellars.co.uk/">heritagecellars.co.uk</a>; <a href="https://rdwines.shop/">rdwines.shop</a>) </strong>Having dealt over the past couple of weeks with drinks for Dry January, this week I’m looking at wines for people who are doing a month of drinking less, rather than no, alcohol – an event that I’m assured by various authoritative sources (OK, by a string of enthusiastic PRs) has come to be known as Damp January. That could of course mean drinking fewer glasses of your usual tipple, but it could also mean finding wines that have significantly lower alcohol in the first place. There are plenty of lighter wines that pre-date the current no-low fashions: wines that have lower alcohol as a function of the conditions and grape varieties and the stylistic ambitions of the winemaker rather than any conscious effort to reduce the abv. Wines such as that great burst of sweetly muscat-grapey frothy joy that is Moscato d’Asti from Piedmont in northwest Italy, as exquisitely represented here by Ceretto’s ebullient 5.5% abv example.</p><p><strong>Tesco Finest Steep Slopes Riesling QbA, Mosel, Germany 2021 (£7, <a href="https://www.tesco.com/">Tesco</a>) </strong>Another classic region that has long specialized in naturally low-alcohol wines is the Mosel Valley in Germany. This is riesling country, and it’s that variety’s naturally steely acidity that makes a light and technically off-dry wine such as Moselland Riesling Kabinett 2021 (£10.95, <a href="http://tanners-wines.co.uk/">tanners-wines.co.uk</a>) “feel” dry in the mouth – the acidity “disguises” the sugar so that you don’t really notice the sweetness, just the succulent stone fruit and the refreshing lively feel. The wine has presence enough to feel as if it has more than its 8% alcohol, too, and that barely perceptible sugar is actually very good for matching with dishes with a little chilli spice. Over the past couple of decades, the fashion in Mosel and other regions of Germany is to ferment more of the natural sugar into alcohol and make drier styles. But even these are scarcely heavyweights in the alcohol department: Tesco’s great value Steep Slopes with its lime-candy raciness clocks in at a relatively modest 11.5% abv.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/22/great-wines-to-make-the-most-of-damp-january">Continue reading...</a>

<p>You’re successful and do control and logic well – but it’s time to dare yourself dream and listen to your body</p><p><em><strong>The dilemma </strong>Although I only look about 30, I am about to turn 40 and I am worried I am going to self-destruct. The real issue, though, is that turning 40 feels like doors are about to close. Professionally, I am successful. I do a hard, responsible job. I know I am good at what I do. The “but” is that I am single. I have never had any children and the only romantic relationship I have had in the past decade was with someone who would not commit to me. I can’t countenance internet dating; that’s not a value judgment on what anyone else wants to do, but it isn’t for me. I feel like I am open to meeting people, but having lost the most recent years of my life to the pandemic, the scope of possibilities for this seems minuscule.</em></p><p><em>I have always had an issue with wanting something without knowing the particulars. I was never a child who “dreamed” of a wedding. If I met someone I liked, I might want to date them, but all through my early adulthood when my peers wanted a boyfriend, I don’t remember sharing their thought process – unless we were talking about a specific person. Similarly, the question, “Do you want children?” and even “Do you want a partner?” is unanswerable to me unless I know the circumstances.</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/22/ask-philippa-perry-im-single-about-to-turn-40-and-fear-i-will-self-destruct">Continue reading...</a>

<p>So many people claim to ‘know’ the royal family that they take sides accordingly</p><p>I almost passed Catherine Bennett’s article by, so fed up have I become with the outpourings of blind condemnation that have been the norm (“<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/14/prince-harry-has-left-the-zoo-so-why-is-he-being-treated-like-a-caged-animal">Prince Harry has left the zoo. So why is he being treated like a caged animal?</a>”, Comment). It was an eye-opener to find a journalist analysing the book without a preformed judgment that one side is wholly right and the other wholly wrong. Instead, there was a straightforward look at what Harry’s book, <em>Spare</em>, tells about being inside the royal family. They have a life so far removed from the ordinary experience that it is incredible so many believe they truly “know” the character of individual royals and are prepared to die in a Twitter or Facebook ditch defending them.</p><p>What is most strange is that Catherine Bennett’s observations are so obvious, and should have been so to everyone.

<ul><li>Clash of bitter British middleweight rivals ends in shock</li><li>Referee stopped fight after Smith landed flurry of blows</li></ul><p>Liam Smith stopped Chris Eubank Jr with brutal and clinical authority in the fourth round of their middleweight contest in Manchester on Saturday night. His decisive victory, after an initially competitive and intriguing bout, settled the simmering animosity between the two men and has earned Smith the right to engage in far more prestigious fights. While no title was at stake in this domestic showdown between two fierce local rivals, Smith knew that a fourth defeat in his 37th bout would have been devastating for his future prospects. Eubank Jr, who is a year younger at 33, looked dazed and stricken beneath the percussive fists of Smith.</p><p>Pinned in his own corner early in the shockingly decisive round, Eubank Jr was caught by a blurring flurry of blows which culminated in a left hook and a cuffing right which sent him crumpling to the canvas. He was on his haunches, his right glove trying desperately to gain a grip on the ropes so that he could haul himself back to his feet. When he managed to get up Eubank Jr staggered drunkenly towards the referee, Victor Laughlin, but he was clearly hurt and confused. He spread his hands, questioningly, while Laughlin counted. It was as if he was asking the referee why he was still shouting: “Six … seven … eight.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/22/liam-smith-stuns-chris-eubank-jr-with-fourth-round-stoppage">Continue reading...</a>
