<p>The humble honeybee hasn’t had an easy go of things recently. Between climate change, habitat destruction, pesticide use and attrition from diseases, one of the planet’s most important pollinators has seen its numbers <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/06/19/733761393/more-bad-buzz-for-bees-record-numbers-of-honey-bee-colonies-died-last-winter"><ins>decline dramatically in recent years</ins></a>. All of that bodes poorly for us humans. In the US, honeybees are essential to about one-third of the fruit and produce Americans eat. But the good news is that a solution to one of the problems affecting honeybees is making its way to farmers.</p><p>This week, for the first time, the US Department of Agriculture <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230104005262/en/First-in-Class-Honeybee-Vaccine-Receives-Conditional-License-from-the-USDA-Center-for-Veterinary-Biologics">granted conditional approval</a> for an insect vaccine. A biotech firm named Dalan Animal Health recently developed a prophylactic vaccine to protect honeybees from American foulbrood disease. The drug contains dead Paenibacillus larvae, the bacteria that causes the illness.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Thankfully, the vaccine won’t require beekeepers to jab entire colonies of individual insects with the world’s smallest syringe. Instead, administering the drug involves mixing it in with the queen feed worker bees eat. The vaccine then makes its way into the “royal jelly” the drones feed their queen. Her offspring will then be born with some immunity against the harmful bacteria.</p><p>The treatment represents a breakthrough for a few reasons.

However, after identifying the protein that prompts an immune response in bees, researchers <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjODEzYWUzOS03ZDU4LTQxY2ItYWM2Ni1hZDgzMDYwNmNlZWYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAxOC8xMi8yMy9zY2llbmNlL2JlZS12YWNjaW5lLWhvbmV5YmVlLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijc4N2E1MGM4LTNiYTQtNDY0NS04NjAwLWRmOTBmMzNjMDAzMSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAb6VV0d68wCQoZrsmV_FuGVeQI3MAbZKHIPjWBcpgSmw&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2018%2F12%2F23%2Fscience%2Fbee-vaccine-honeybee.html"><ins>realized</ins></a> they could protect an entire hive through a single queen. The vaccine is also a far more humane treatment for American foulbrood. The disease can easily wipe out colonies of 60,000 bees at once, and it often leaves beekeepers with one choice: burn the infected hives to save what they can.</p><p>Dr. Annette Kleiser, the CEO of Dalan, told <em>The Times </em>the company hopes to use the vaccine as a blueprint for other treatments to protect honeybees. “Bees are livestock and should have the same modern tools to care for them and protect them that we have for our chickens, cats, dogs and so on,” she said. “We’re really hoping we’re going to change the industry now.”</p>

<p>Elon Musk has asked a federal judge to move his upcoming Tesla shareholder trial out of San Francisco. Per the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-technology-austin-san-francisco-business-91117a5a281927b4e3511e6244b78372"><ins>Associated Press</ins></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-reportedly-cuts-alex-spiro-232831688.html"><ins>Alex Spiro</ins></a>, the billionaire’s personal lawyer, filed the request late Friday, less than two weeks before the trial is scheduled to kick off on January 17th. Musk’s legal team argues “a substantial portion” of the potential jury pool in San Francisco is likely to hold a bias against Musk due to recent media coverage criticizing his actions at Twitter and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-reportedly-lays-off-part-of-global-content-moderation-team-182048288.html"><ins>seemingly never-ending layoffs at the company</ins></a>. Musk has asked to move the trial to Texas, which has been home to Tesla headquarters since late 2021.</p><p>The class action lawsuit involves “false and misleading” statements Musk made in 2018 when he said he was considering taking Tesla private at $420 per share.  Musk’s now-infamous “<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1026872652290379776?s=20&amp;t=bI5TaM4bx9Dnc3ZFSwjp9w"><ins>funding secured</ins></a>” tweet landed the billionaire in trouble with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, eventually leading to a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-16-elon-musk-sec-settlement-approved-by-judge.html"><ins>$40 million settlement</ins></a> with the agency. The shareholders involved in the suit <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-funding-secured-tweet-misleading-shareholder-lawsuit-205058441.html">won an early victory</a> last spring when federal judge Edward Chen concluded that Musk had “recklessly made the statements with knowledge as to their falsity.” The upcoming trial will determine whether Musk’s tweet affected the automaker’s stock price and if he should be held accountable for potential damages.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“Musk’s concerns are unfounded and his motion is meritless,” Nicholas Porritt, one of the lawyers representing Tesla shareholders, told the Associated Press. “The Northern District of California is the proper venue for this lawsuit and where it has been actively litigated for over four years.” On Saturday, Judge Chen told the two sides he would hear Musk’s request on January 13th.</p>

## Twitter has reportedly laid off more of its global content moderation team

<p>In what has become a monthly occurrence at Twitter, the company has cut more of its workforce. On Friday night, Twitter reportedly laid off “at least a dozen” workers across its Dublin and Singapore offices. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-07/elon-musk-cuts-more-twitter-staff-overseeing-content-moderation?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a>, the casualties include Analuisa Dominguez, the company’s former senior director of revenue policy. The outlet reports that Twitter also cut workers responsible for handling the company’s misinformation policy, in addition to a handful of employees involved with the platform’s global appeals process and state media program.</p><p>Ella Irwin, Twitter’s head of trust and safety, confirmed the company recently laid off more staff but disputed the teams impacted by the cuts. “It made more sense to consolidate teams under one leader (instead of two) for example,” she told <em>Bloomberg</em>, adding Twitter eliminated roles in areas where the company didn’t see enough “volume” to justify the talent expenditure. She also said Twitter increased staffing at its appeals department and would continue to have a head of revenue policy.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On November 21st, shortly after issuing his <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-hardcore-twitter-ultimatum-111506466.html"><ins>“extremely hardcore” ultimatum</ins></a> to Twitter employees, Elon Musk <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-done-with-job-cuts-blue-verified-062148989.html"><ins>reportedly said</ins></a> the company wouldn’t fire or lay off any more workers during an all-hands meeting. While the scale of Twitter's subsequent layoffs hasn’t matched those that came shortly after Musk’s takeover, the company has cut staff despite the billionaire’s pledge. The company let go of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-has-reportedly-laid-off-more-of-its-infrastructure-team-192330953.html"><ins>part of its infrastructure division</ins></a> halfway through last month. One recent estimate by <em>The Information</em> puts the company’s headcount at around 2,000 employees or a little over a quarter of what it had before Musk’s purchase.</p>

## Apple’s long-rumored mixed reality headset could finally debut this spring

<p>After years of development, Apple’s long-rumored augmented and virtual reality headset is nearly ready. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-01-08/when-will-apple-launch-the-reality-pro-mixed-reality-headset-apple-2023-devices-lcnfzkc7?sref=10lNAhZ9">According to <em>Bloomberg’s</em> Mark Gurman</a>, the company plans to announce the device sometime this spring ahead of its annual WWDC conference in June. In a sign that a launch is finally on the horizon, Apple has reportedly shared the headset with a handful of high-profile software developers, giving them a first look at its new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-xros-mixed-reality-headset-130532613.html"><ins>“xrOS” software</ins></a>. After announcing &quot;Reality Pro&quot; in the spring, Gurman expects Apple to release the device in the fall.</p><p>The final sprint to get the headset out the door will impact the rest of Apple’s 2023 product lineup. On the software front, the next version of the company’s iOS operating system is likely to ship with “fewer major changes than originally planned” due to Apple reassigning software engineers to the xrOS team. “The same goes for macOS 14,” Gurman adds. Apple’s hardware plans are even less thrilling. The company has no updates of “of note” planned for its iPad, Apple Watch and audio lines. Gurman says new iPad Pro models with OLED displays are on the way, but those likely won’t arrive until 2024. He warns the upcoming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-reportedly-developing-new-pro-display-xdr-monitor-194353294.html"><ins>Apple Silicon MacPro</ins></a> will be “another disappointment.” The forthcoming desktop will reportedly feature the same design as its 2019 predecessor, and you won’t be able to upgrade the computer’s RAM on your own due to the architecture of Apple’s M-series chipsets.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The only bright spots in an otherwise dull release schedule could be a new 15-inch MacBook Air and the iPhone 15. Of the latter, Gurman says the entire iPhone 15 line will feature Apple’s new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/all-iphone-15-models-will-reportedly-feature-dynamic-island-cutouts-222957434.html">Dynamic Island feature</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphones-switch-usb-c-comply-eu-charger-law-075020117.html"><ins>USB-C charging</ins></a>. The Pro models will also include new titanium frames and haptic volume buttons.</p>
