## The Kardashians: Billion Dollar Dynasty review – who knew that Kim was once the face of a toilet?

<p>This talking head-filled two-part tale of fame for fame’s sake profiles the reality TV family – leaving plenty of space for cynicism when it comes to their more questionable moments</p><p>Who is Kim Kardashian? It can’t be a wholly ridiculous question, since it’s difficult to give a simple answer about what she does for a living, and in any case plenty of people really do not know. Kardashian is one of the world’s biggest celebrities, but she emerged at a time when social media and multichannel TV fractured and compartmentalised pop culture, making it possible to be super-famous without having an effect on those who don’t actively engage. A pithy primer might be needed, then, and Channel 4’s two-part documentary The Kardashians: Billion Dollar Dynasty provides one.</p><p>We start with the 16-year-old Kardashian in a home movie, proclaiming that she will one day be famous. This is a story of fame for its own sake. Kardashian isn’t a singer or an actor, and although she has had millions of pictures taken of her, she’s not a model – instead she’s one of those 21st-century celebs who is famous for being themselves. The template for that career was set by the hotel-empire heiress Paris Hilton, for whom a young Kardashian worked as a personal assistant: archive footage shows Hilton posing for paparazzi with Kardashian, somewhat more glamorous than the average PA, making sure she’s also in the shot.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/08/the-kardashians-billion-dollar-dynasty-review-channel-4">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Just as it seemed Leeds United were staring at another early FA Cup exit to file with the rest of them, the teenage substitute Sonny Perkins equalised deep into second-half stoppage time to earn a replay against 10-man Cardiff City. Leeds’s recent history in this competition is ignominious at best – they headed out at this stage in each of the five previous seasons – and at half-time they trailed to goals by Jaden Philogene and Sheyi Ojo.</p><p>Leeds replied through the substitute Rodrigo, who would later see a penalty saved by Jak Alnwick, the spot-kick awarded after Joel Bagan’s deliberate handball prevented a goal. The Cardiff defender received a red card for his actions. However 18-year-old Perkins, on only his second senior appearance for the club, eased the Leeds pain by converting from close range in injury time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/08/cardiff-city-leeds-united-fa-cup-third-round-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Why was this rising to an astounding 80% of young people by the time they reached 18? Is Instagram wrecking mental health, or is it TikTok?</p><p>Others argued that social media may be the gravity, but something more immediate had caused the crash. The rise in acute psychological distress – far higher in girls than boys – is observed in a <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/news/2022/nov/almost-half-young-people-report-mental-health-problems">study</a> comparing 2021 with 2007: suicidal ideation among one in 10 girls aged 16, self-harm at almost a quarter.

## Alcarràs director Carla Simón: ‘I have feelings for Spanish culture and Catalan culture’

<p>Inspired by her own rural upbringing after her parents both died, the Barcelona‑born film‑maker’s latest movie won the top prize in Berlin for its vivid portrayal of Catalonia’s peach farmers</p><p>The films of Catalan writer-director Carla Simón could almost – <em>almost</em> – serve as tourist ads for the life bucolic. In her 2017 debut, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jul/14/summer-1993-review-moving-childhood-loss">Summer 1993</a></em>, a young girl discovers the countryside for the first time, while her follow-up, <em>Alcarràs – </em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/17/women-dominate-berlin-film-festival-as-alcarras-wins-golden-bear">which won the Golden Bear</a>, the top prize at the 2022 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/berlinfilmfestival">Berlin film festival </a>– is set on a peach farm, where children run wild between multigenerational family meals in the sun. Yet, joyous as Simón’s two features are, they are built on a hard foundation of bitter reality. In <em>Alcarràs</em>, a story underpinned by the challenges faced by farmers across Europe, the Solé family lives under immediate threat of eviction, while <em>Summer 1993</em> is based on Simón’s own experience as a child after the death of both her parents.</p><p>Even so, Simón’s stories brim with the hope carried by new generations – the main theme now in her own life. In London late last year, the director whose full name is Carla Simón Pipó is cheerfully wide awake despite the recent birth of a son, Manel, then three and a half months. Simón, who speaks Catalan-accented perfect English, wears a crisp, sober business suit matching the formality of a meeting room in a distinctly corporate West End hotel; Manel occasionally comes into view outside the wall’s glass panel, wheeled to and fro by his father.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/08/alcarras-director-carla-simon-i-have-feelings-for-spanish-culture-and-catalan-culture">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Antonio Banderas plays a jaded career criminal with a softer side in a film that limps between Miami sleaze cliches</p><p>Antonio Banderas stars as Cuda, a jaded career criminal, recently released from prison, who is paired with a young professional fighter turned hired muscle in the employ of Kate Bosworth’s vampy lady mob boss. Your crime movie cliche bingo card should already be half full on the strength of the first sentence of this review, even before I reveal that Cuda, despite a lifetime of inflicting pain on people, also has a conscience and a soft heart when it comes to vulnerable teenage girls who remind him of his estranged daughter. It’s thuddingly predictable stuff that limps through a plot involving nefarious sex traffickers, treachery and a liberal smearing of Miami sleaze.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/08/the-enforcer-review-antonio-banderas-thuddingly-predictable-thriller">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Laura Galán excels as the tormented victim of three mean girls in her village in Carlota Pereda’s striking feature debut</p><p>The real moments of horror in this caustic adolescent character study don’t play out when the blood is flowing. More uncomfortable than the glimpses of physical torture are the extended scenes of mental torment, in which Sara (Laura Galán, impressive) is persecuted, to her face and in the combat arena of social media, by three mean girls in her village in rural Spain. The film’s title refers to the girls’ nickname for Sara, but their taunting goes far beyond name-calling. So when she witnesses the abduction of her bullies by a bearded stranger who previously dropped her a crumb of kindness, her first instinct is to leave the girls to their grisly fates.</p><p>There’s an atmospheric, unsavoury oiliness to the cinematography and an uncomfortable tussle of sympathies – director Carlota Pereda shows real promise as a genre film-maker.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/08/piggy-review-carlota-pereda-laura-galan-atmospheric-spanish-teen-horror">Continue reading...</a>

Here, she explains how she overcame her fear</p><p>I never thought I’d kiss a cat. Or like them, or be in a room with them. Cats, to me, were evil and unpredictable. A classic projection, if ever I saw one, of fear manifesting as dislike. Intense fear.

My home was my safe place. No cats allowed. For some years they asked for a cat, on and off. Eventually, the “why we should get a cat” lists started getting toilet-roll long and I started thinking, maybe we can get a kitten. Kittens are cute. I started watching videos.

<p>Despite the best efforts of Olivia Colman and cinematographer Roger Deakins, the director’s first solo writing effort is uneven</p><p>There are plenty of themes swimming around in Sam Mendes’s sprawling, uneven <em>Empire of Light</em>, but few coherent ideas linking them. Set in the 1980s, in the kind of pursed-lipped and sanctimonious British seaside town that wears its former glory like a long outdated party frock, the film awkwardly slings together mental health issues and racially motivated violence, then ties it up with a rather glib point about the unifying power of cinema.</p><p>Olivia Colman plays Hilary, a troubled front-of-house manager at a seafront picture palace, who forms a romantic bond with a much younger employee (Micheal Ward). Colman is a phenomenal talent and Ward shows potential, but even so, the relationship between them struggles to convince as anything more than a plot device. This is the first film that Mendes has directed from his own screenplay (he had a co-writing credit on <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/12/1917-review-sam-mendes-first-world-war-ww1-unblinking-vision-one-shot">1917</a></em>), and for all its visual flair, courtesy of veteran cinematographer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/aug/22/the-big-picture-a-moment-of-downtime-by-cinematographer-roger-deakins">Roger Deakins</a>, there’s little to suggest that Mendes has the writing chops to match his directing skill.</p><p>In cinemas from 9 January</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/08/empire-of-light-review-sam-mendes-olivia-colman-sprawling-love-letter-to-cinema">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Tom Hanks’s cranky widower may tread well-worn ground​, but the neighbourly kindness that saves him is life-affirming</p><p>A Hollywood remake of the glumly life-affirming 2015 Swedish box-office hit <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jul/02/a-man-called-ove-review-black-comedy-with-hefty-feelgood-factor-rolf-lassgard-bahar-pars">A Man Called Ove</a></em>, which was itself based on a bestselling novel, <em>A Man Called Otto</em> taps into a seemingly unquenchable audience appetite for stories of cantankerous grumps redeemed by the healing embrace of community. The picture stars an uncharacteristically abrasive Tom Hanks as Otto, a short-fused widower who crankily micromanages everything in his street, and also his own multiple suicide attempts. The arrival of new neighbours – heavily pregnant Marisol (Mariana Treviño), her useless husband and their kids – interrupts Otto’s plans to rejoin his recently departed wife.</p><p>If there’s one thing even more attractive than the sweet embrace of death, it’s the opportunity to demonstrate the correct way of doing stuff. Everything from parallel parking to dishwasher maintenance falls under Otto’s self-appointed remit. It’s formulaic stuff that makes heavy weather of its flashbacks (Hanks’s son Truman struggles as the younger Otto). But just as Otto is worn down by the warmth and generosity of Marisol, so all but the most dogged of sceptics will be charmed by the message of the redemptive power of small acts of kindness and plastic containers full of tamales.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/08/a-man-called-otto-review-tom-hanks-formulaic-but-charming-grumpy-old-man-movie">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An alien invasion forces humanity to reinvent itself in an ambitious, cinematic thriller that tackles the weightiest issues of our age</p><p><em>Cold People</em> is Tom Rob Smith’s fifth novel, but in the years since his bestselling debut, <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/child-44-9781471175176">Child 44</a></em>, he has also developed a parallel award-winning career as a screenwriter, and the influence of a more visual form is subtly felt throughout this cinematic speculative fiction about the future of humanity.</p><p>The premise is classic disaster movie territory, almost to the point of cliche: an alien invasion threatens to wipe humanity from the face of the Earth. The planet’s population is given 30 days to relocate to Antarctica, which will become a vast reservation for the remnants of the species; there they will either die out or adapt, depending on their willingness to work together. But the alien overlords are not the focus of Smith’s interest here; they are no more than a device to effect this revolutionary reinvention not only of human society, but of humanity itself.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/08/cold-people-by-tom-rob-smith-review-a-chilling-vision-of-a-new-society">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In an extract from his new book, the Observer columnist describes how substituting ethnic superiority with ‘cultural difference’ has allowed traditional racism to seep back into the mainstream. How can we get out of the box of racial thinking?</p><p>‘The Negro is not. Any more than the white man.” So wrote Frantz Fanon, the Martinique-born revolutionary and intellectual, in his 1952 masterpiece, <em>Black Skin</em><em>, White Masks</em><em>.</em> He was making an argument about the illusory character of racial categorisation. And, yet, more than 70 years after Fanon wrote those lines, they still feel unsettling, as if they are a challenge not just to racialisation but also to our identity, our very being. That they should do so exposes the deeply conflicted relationship we still possess with race.</p><p>We live in an age in which in most societies there is a moral abhorrence of racism, albeit that in most, bigotry and discrimination still disfigure the lives of many. We also live in an age saturated with identitarian thinking and obsessed with placing people into racial boxes. The more we despise racial thinking, the more we seem to cling to it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/08/racism-rebranded-how-far-right-ideology-feeds-off-identity-politics-kenan-malik-not-so-black-and-white">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Oven-fresh treats for a breakfast to linger over</p><p>Few things galvanise the appetite quite like a pre-breakfast walk on a winter’s morning. Returning home, newspaper and loaf of bread in hand, it is then that the hob is lit, the coffee is on and the kitchen table becomes the best place in the world. If there are guests around, there will be something more than a bacon sandwich on our plates. Sometimes, there may be the plump little fish cakes I made this week. Crisp golden cushions of smoked fish and mashed potato, good for breakfast or supper, eaten with a jar of zappy pickles on the side.</p><p>The recipe is useful in that you can make it the day before, patting the cakes into rounds and leaving them in the fridge overnight. I use prepared fillets to save the pernickety task of tugging out the fine bones that lurk down each side of a whole kipper. Time is saved, but I rather miss not seeing the shimmering gold, silver and black of the splendid, opened-out smoked fish.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/08/nigel-slaters-recipes-for-breakfast-muffins-and-kipper-cakes-with-dill-sauce">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Research shows both long-term gains for children who attend preschool and women who need support to take up jobs</p><p>Childcare is back in the news, thanks to Liz Truss lamenting Rishi Sunak’s decision to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jan/04/liz-truss-urges-rishi-sunak-not-to-ditch-her-childcare-reforms">dump her childcare proposals</a> – including the scrapping of staff-child ratios for nurseries. But there are deeper reasons for childcare’s increasing role in our policy debates. Rising female employment requires more childcare and a Conservative party nervous about relying on older voters occasionally turns to a childcare policy offer for the squeezed middle aged. After all, subsidising childcare is more manageable than buying every angry millennial a house.</p><p>Research supports the idea that a focus on childcare can deliver dividends. A <a href="https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/138/1/363/6701924">new paper</a> examines what happened to 4,000 four-year-olds in Boston, Massachusetts, where a lottery determined who got a publicly funded preschool place at the turn of the millennium. Comparing those who did/didn’t get in, researchers find lasting impacts: those attending were more likely to graduate from high school and 18% more likely to immediately enrol at university, driven by improved behavioural outcomes, not better test results. It’s boys who mainly benefit, which matters when <a href="https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/data-and-analysis/student-characteristics-data/population-data-dashboard/">far fewer men than women have been going to university</a> since the mid-1990s.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/08/childcare-is-important-but-quality-and-quantity-decide-who-benefits-most">Continue reading...</a>

Her family lost the farm, she pawned her wedding ring and spent time in jail.

Now, <em>Strays</em> adds heady organ grooves and hypnotic southern rock to her band’s considerable chops.

<p>While the decisions cannot undo abortion bans in the 13 states they exist, it could make a huge difference where the right is protected</p><p>This week, the federal government announced two decisions designed to improve abortion access in the US.

<p>Two high school murder mysteries, one all-female detective agency, and an audacious heist on the Titanic</p><p>The year kicks off with a clutch of excellent debuts for young adult readers. In Ravena Guron’s <strong><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/this-book-kills-9781803705415">This Book Kills</a></strong> (Usborne), British-Indian scholarship student Jess Choudary finds herself under suspicion of murder at her elite boarding school. Wealthy classmate Hugh Henry Van Boren is found dead in the woods, the crime scene set up to look like a scene from one of her short stories. Jess’s hunt for the real killer reveals the dark side of privilege, pairing boarding school drama with deliciously plotted Agatha Christie-style mystery. This one will be catnip for fans of Holly Jackson and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/08/one-of-us-is-next-karen-m-mcmanus-review">Karen M McManus</a>.</p><p>There’s more high school murder in <strong><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/promise-boys-9781035003150">Promise Boys</a></strong> (Macmillan, February), from American writer Nick Brooks. Urban Promise Prep is a very different kind of school, claiming to transform “roughneck” boys into upstanding young men to avoid the outcomes typical of their Washington DC neighbourhood. When the authoritarian principal is violently killed on the school site, three boys become the prime suspects. Told from numerous perspectives, this smart, tense thriller takes a sharp look at how American society treats boys of colour.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/08/young-adult-books-roundup-reviews">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The deranged politics driving the US Freedom Caucus and Tory anti-Europeans can only lead to one outcome: a death spiral for both</p><p>It is a commonplace that today’s Conservative party has become an ungovernable rabble – a group of factional sects unfit to govern, with too many in the party and among its media supporters careless of effective government as a matter of principle. What else can be said of a party that has delivered three prime ministers and home secretaries, four chancellors and health secretaries and five education secretaries in one calendar year? What is less explored is the deeper ideological source of this phenomenon.</p><p>An important clue came last week with the spectacle of newly elected Republicans in the House of Representatives <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/06/kevin-mccarthy-republican-wins-house-speaker">taking 15 votes over five days</a> to elect candidate Kevin McCarthy as House speaker, the second most important role in the US constitution after the president. No speaker and the House cannot function – no swearing in of members, committee chairs or passing of laws. Business was frozen as McCarthy made an incredible <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/02/kevin-mccarthy-speaker-republicans-hardliners-house">series of concessions</a> on House procedures and his power as speaker to the “Freedom Caucus” of ultra rightwingers to win their votes.

<p>We spend a lot of time worrying about the skin on our faces, but the skin on our bodies needs as much care. These 10 great products will get you started</p><p>It’s amazing how much attention we pay to our faces – cream, masks, exfoliators, toners, serums, cleansers – and then we pretty much ignore everything below the neck. Which makes no sense in winter. Perhaps it’s because our bodies – certainly on this side of the hemisphere – are rarely on show. But here’s the not so new newsflash: the skin on our bodies is just as important as that on our faces. As we age, we produce less collagen, which means the skin loses elasticity and plumpness in the same way that it does on our face. It also regenerates more slowly, making it more susceptible to dullness. Regularly buffing/exfoliating will combat this – and if a body scrub is too messy, simply add a shower oil to a body brush or mesh sponge and massage it over. You can get away with this every other day, but moisturising should be daily. Sorry, I know moisturising your body every single day sounds tedious, but once you get into the routine it will take all of two minutes. It’s a small price to pay for your skin feeling and looking healthier. And, come summer, you won’t be that person who disrobes only to discover the skin on their body looks nothing like the glowing, well-hydrated version on their face. As someone once told me, summer bodies are made in the winter…</p><p><strong>1. Gisou Honey-infused Body Oil </strong>£40, <a href="https://uk.gisou.com/">uk.gisou.com</a> <br /><strong>2.

## Rishi Sunak v Keir Starmer: battle of the speeches revealed the critical choice facing Britain | Andrew Rawnsley

<p>The fundamental differences of belief between the two party leaders are much more important than their superficial similarities</p><p>Some people look from Sir Keir Starmer to Rishi Sunak and ask: what’s the difference? They are damned as carbon-copy “socialists” by the hardliners of the right, among whom anyone more moderate than Jacob Rees-Mogg is regarded as a <a href="https://www.cityam.com/brexit-opportunities-minister-jacob-rees-mogg-i-would-refuse-to-serve-in-socialist-rishi-sunaks-cabinet/">traitor to authentic conservatism</a>. On the wilder shores of the left, where anyone more moderate than Jeremy Corbyn is a betrayer of the true faith, Starmer v Sunak is dismissed as a choice between two Tory prime ministers. It is not just ideological zealots who see them as identikit centrists. Some more sensible folk can be heard wondering whether there’s really that much to choose between them.</p><p>This is partly because the prime minister and the leader of the opposition do have more in common than two-syllable surnames which begin with an S. Neither has been in politics all that long, both having only become MPs in 2015, and that inexperience sometimes shows. Both were recruited to rescue their parties from the toxic legacy of a catastrophic predecessor. Both are well-manicured men who never appear with a hair out of place or a speck of fluff on their well-tailored suits. Looking professional matters to them. Both believe that attention to detail and being on top of issues are more important qualities than the ability to deliver a snappy phrase, enthuse a crowd or concoct a lie. It is arguable which of them has the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/oct/23/if-tory-party-brings-back-boris-johnson-fit-only-for-straitjacket">greater contempt</a> for Boris Johnson.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/08/rishi-sunak-v-keir-starmer-battle-of-the-speeches-revealed-the-critical-choice-facing-britain">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Advocates attack president’s failure to uphold campaign pledges ahead of first visit to southern border since he took office</p><p>Under pressure to address a surge of migrants at the US-Mexico border, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden">Joe Biden</a> announced a far-reaching crackdown on migrants seeking asylum last week, expanding the use of a controversial public health measure known as Title 42 to restrict people from Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti and Venezuela from illegally entering the US, while offering those legally seeking relief a new pathway to America.</p><p>Before the president’s first trip to the US-Mexico border since he took office in 2020, immigration advocates condemned the Biden administration’s decision to expand Title 42 as disheartening and a failure to uphold his campaign promises. They took some solace in the creation of a legal pathway to asylum for those in four countries, but still, for them, Biden’s actions were not enough – they leave out other migrants, and the parole program is beset by requirements that impose significant barriers to migrants without access to resources, perpetuating inequities within the US immigration system.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/08/biden-us-mexico-border-title-42-migrants">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Planning to sail across the world – or re-watch all nine seasons of The Office? I know which I’d prefer</p><p>New year, new you? No thank you. I plan – and perhaps you’ll join me – to embrace the oldest me I can find. Improvements, upgrades, in a cost of living crisis? Are you <em>joking</em>? In a time when simply staying warm and fed is a struggle, we’re expected to add <em>value</em>? We’re expected to tone our bodies and refine our minds when the weather is horrid and the trains are off and the tap water tastes like violence? And God, honestly, who has the time, especially when time itself is unreliable, sometimes a viscous fluid that runs slowly through the days, other times it transforms into a rolling dice, likely to tumble very fast before getting stuck behind a sofa. Change… it’s not for me.</p><p>Instead, I will try digging into the very guts of me, the laze and the slime, the most awful honesties and grim-witted shames. I will wallow there for a while, in a bath of my own soups. Isn’t this, in fact, what people want when they employ anti-ageing products? Or invest in plastic surgery and fillers? Aren’t they trying to see themselves again? To journey back in time and reunite with their truest selves, who nine times out of 10, they recall as looking like a 26-year-old trust-fund manager with big naturals? Our true self, our authentic self, is hidden (we’re encouraged to believe) by our jowls or cankles, or the soft belt of flesh that sits over our jeans. It’s compromised by the back passage of time. To this, I object.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/08/new-year-new-you-but-why-when-the-old-you-is-perfect-as-it-is">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Danielle Deadwyler’s nuanced performance as the mother of Emmett Till, the black teenager murdered by southern racists, is the pivot of Chinonye Chukwu’s stirring real-life drama</p><p>An awards-worthy performance from Danielle Deadwyler (who stole the show in 2021’s <em>The Harder </em><em>They Fall</em>) lends a passionate heart to this solidly engrossing and still contemporary historical drama set in 1955 and dedicated “to the life and legacy of Mamie Till-Mobley”. Revisiting the true story of the mother turned activist whose battle for justice proved a cornerstone of the emerging American civil rights movement, director and co-writer Chinonye Chukwu treads a fine line between display and discretion, laying bare brutal truths without alienating a wide audience (the British Board of Film Classification’s advice for this 12A movie warns only of “disturbing images, upsetting scenes, moderate threat”). The fact that the Emmett Till Antilynching Act was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/29/emmett-till-anti-lynching-act-biden-signs">passed into US law last year</a> makes the subject matter all the more timely.</p><p>We open in sunny pastel tones that will gradually fade into darkness, and the harmonious singalong sounds of doo-wop that mutate into a nightmarish scream – a recurrent motif. Mamie (Deadwyler) and her 14-year-old son, Emmett (Jalyn Hall), are driving through Chicago, a metropolitan city where underlying racism is largely hidden beneath a veneer of civility. Emmett is due to visit relatives in Mississippi, a prospect that terrifies Mamie. “I don’t want him seeing himself the way those people are seen down there,” she tells her mother, Alma (Whoopi Goldberg, who also co-produces), while instructing her son to “be <em>small</em> down there”. Yet Emmett, a gapped-toothed bundle of naive enthusiasm, is unprepared for the strictures of the segregated south, and soon falls foul of murderous thugs who come calling after dark. “It wasn’t just two white men with guns that night,” says the guilt-racked preacher uncle Moses (John Douglas Thompson), from whose house Emmett is taken. “It was every white man who’d rather see a Negro dead than breathing the same air as him.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/08/till-review-chinonye-chukwu-danielle-deadwyler-wrenching-civil-rights-drama">Continue reading...</a>

No one knew about <em>I’m </em><em>a Fan</em>, which was basically DIY; that list, which everyone pays attention to, legitimised a book that didn’t have the machine behind it.”<br /><br />That’s one job of lists like this, and it’s part of why we spend every autumn hawk-eyed over publishing schedules and trade announcements, buried in bind-up copies and PDFs in our quest for literary gold. But the only thing that ever counts is what is on the page: outsider or insider, if we think you’re bringing out a great first novel (and you’re in the UK or Ireland), a place on the list is yours. The class of 2023 includes a writer on an Emmy-winning Netflix show and a book publicist with a 20-year career at the heart of the trade.<strong><br /><br /></strong>We’ve ushered nearly 80 authors into the spotlight since 2014, from Sally Rooney to Douglas Stuart – one of only 20 men ever to have made the cut, incidentally. (We’ve got five more men this year – for anyone wondering “where are the new male hotshot novelists?”, as one newspaper asked a couple of years ago, you can call off the search.) In 2017 we questioned the scarcity of eligible black and minority ethnic writers; that’s changed, yet you may still wish to consider – as one of our current picks does – whether class limits opportunity (it would hardly be a shock if it did, given a recent Glasgow University study found that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/06/writers-earnings-have-plummeted-with-women-black-and-mixed-race-authors-worst-hit">median author income has sunk to £7,000</a>).<strong><br /><br /></strong>But while arguments can and should rage,<strong> </strong>let’s toast the craft and graft of another 10 outstanding new writers whose subjects and styles are as diverse as their paths into print, which happen to involve Stormzy in one case and the renowned <em>London Review of Books </em>editor Mary-Kay Wilmers in another. From the turmoil of same-sex desire in Victorian England to the funny side of getting divorced in your 20s; from the trials of manhood in recession-hit Belfast to a genre-bending coming-of-age saga from Nigeria by way of Norwich: all are among the sundry riches to be found here. Whether historical or autobiographical, intimate or epic, comic or tragic or all of the above – not least in the case of one frankly uncategorisable novel about nothing less than the end of the world – here’s to yet another year of excellent reading. <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/anthonycummins">Anthony Cummins</a></strong></p><p><strong>We are going through a very difficult time in Nigerian history.

<p>Steve Perryman recalls win in a remarkable 1985-86 season as his old club face league leaders in the FA Cup</p><p>Arsenal will feel the Kassam Stadium’s winter chill. It is open-cornered, lacks a stand at its west end and on a rough evening the cold can rattle the bones. Were Karl Robinson’s Oxford United not such a slick, highly principled outfit at their best, it would fit the cliche of an FA Cup leveller. But it has nothing on the rickety old Manor Ground and its slope where an earlier iteration of Monday night’s tie brought one of the side’s finest hours.</p><p>“We were the sort of team who would hunt you down,” says Steve Perryman, who arrived from Spurs to offer a calm, controlled head in Oxford’s midfield for the later part of the 1985-86 season.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/08/unhappy-memories-for-arsenal-at-oxford-uniteds-old-manor-ground">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘An empty feeling’: Masters snooker begins under cloud amid suspensions

<p>Two Chinese players have been removed from the draw but Shaun Murphy believes those remaining ‘can turn the tide’</p><p>It is more than a decade since the late Willie Thorne described match-fixing in snooker as “endemic” after revealing he had been offered money to fix a match during his playing career. Allegations of corruption on the baize are nothing new, as evidenced by Thorne’s claims, plus suspensions for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/25/stephen-lee-match-fixing-guilty">Stephen Lee</a> and John Higgins in recent years. Snooker has shown it will get tough when it counts.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/may/02/john-higgins-snooker-scandal">Higgins’s suspension in 2010</a> after he admitted breaching betting rules – the then world No 1 was cleared of match-fixing but found guilty of lesser charges – prompted the sport to set up an integrity unit to stamp out corruption. But on the eve of its most prestigious invitational tournament, snooker finds itself in the midst of a fresh crisis.</p><p>The Masters, one of snooker’s triple crown events, begins on Sunday in London under a cloud. Ten Chinese players have been suspended by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) as an investigation into alleged match-fixing continues. On Tuesday, the world No 9, Zhao Xintong, became the highest-profile player <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/03/zhao-xintong-and-zhang-jiankang-suspended-from-world-snooker-tour">to join that list</a>.<br /><br />Zhao and the 2021 Masters champion, Yan Bingtao, have been removed from the draw while eight other professionals from China – Zhang Jiankang, Liang Wenbo, Lu Ning, Li Hang, Zhao Jianbo, Bai Langning, Chang Bingyu and Chen Zifan – are also suspended. The allegations remain exactly that at present but the image this projects of snooker at its elite level is far from healthy. One player being investigated would be worrying. Ten? That arguably casts a shadow over the sport like never before.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/08/masters-snooker-suspensions-chinese-players">Continue reading...</a>

<ul><li>South Africa ends day five on 106 for 2, drawing Third Test in Sydney</li><li>Australia claim series 2-0 after victories in Brisbane and Melbourne</li></ul><p>South Africa’s lower order was instrumental to securing a draw in the third Test in Sydney, after the visitors resumed their first innings on 149 for six on the fifth morning. While Australia’s bowlers were eventually able to dismiss them for 244, short by 21 runs of avoiding the follow-on, that did not come until after lunch and left South Africa only 47 overs to survive. They did so on a surface that had its challenges but was still largely good for batting, with play called off with five overs to spare and South Africa on 106 for 2.</p><p>After watching the first two Tests from the sidelines, it was off-spinner Simon Harmer who took a chance with the bat to press his claim for first-choice status. Resuming alongside Marco Jansen on a day that finally dawned sunny and warm after days of rain, the tall fast bowler was only interested in defence, adding one run in an hour before being dismissed. Harmer though defended well while keeping the scoreboard moving, nullifying the short ball from Australia’s fast bowlers by calmly playing grounded pull shots for singles. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/08/south-africa-hang-on-to-deny-australia-series-sweep-as-sydney-test-ends-in-fighting-draw">Continue reading...</a>

## The Shards by Bret Easton Ellis review – an inspired fever dream of a book

<p>A teenage Bret and his uber-privileged friends cruise around 80s LA while a serial killer stalks the city in a gleefully meta return to form by the author of American Psycho</p><p>The shocks come fast in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/breteastonellis">Bret Easton Ellis</a>’s first novel in 13 years: <em>The Shards </em>is prefaced by a sweetly sincere – or is it? – thank you note from the notoriously misanthropic author “for your support over the past four decades… I’m more appreciative than you’ll ever know”. The story proper begins with the audacious ruse of “Bret Easton Ellis” looking metafictionally back across time at the defining events that befell him and his friends in the autumn of 1981, during their final year in high school. Bret acknowledges the “prince-of-darkness literary persona” readers ascribe to him as “the man who wrote <em>American Psycho</em>”, but insists that “had never been the intended pose”. What follows, we gather, is to be the origin story of a lifelong shadow.</p><p>A pleasingly slippery, impish author, Ellis uses all the up-to-date autofictional techniques to far more exciting effect than, say, Ben Lerner’s superficially tasteful and objectionably dull novel <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/05/the-topeka-school-ben-lerner-review">The Topeka School</a></em>. A devotee of genre shlock, he characteristically weaves a lurid serial killer plotline into his high school <em>Künstlerroman</em>. <em>The Shards </em>reads like a Karl Ove Knausgård novel spliced with a Dario Argento movie.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/08/the-shards-bret-easton-ellis-review-metafiction-1980s-los-angeles">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Fancy staying in a mansion or lakeside pad for absolutely nothing? Sign up as a housesitter and the place is yours in return for pet care and plant-watering duties</p><p>My partner Nick and I spent last Easter at a farmhouse in a Cotswolds village. We read books, enjoyed lunches on the terrace and took long walks along footpaths between the canary-yellow rapeseed fields. With an aga, original art works and an en suite bathroom with claw-foot bath, this limestone mansion would have cost thousands to rent – especially in the Easter holidays. But we stayed for free, in return for looking after the owners’ friendly cocker spaniels, a long-haired cat and the children’s hamster, while the family went skiing in the Alps.</p><p>We landed this amazing break through <a href="https://www.trustedhousesitters.com/">Trusted Housesitters</a>, a website that matches owners with sitters worldwide (membership £99 for a year). <a href="https://www.housesittersuk.co.uk/">House Sitters UK</a> offers a similar service, but covers only this country (£29 a year). Unsurprisingly given the state of the economy, companies offering housesitting services are reporting a boom this year.

<p>Ian Macdonald spent months in the 80s at an ironworks on the north coast, shortly before its closure, and captured the dignity of a shared way of life</p><p><a href="http://ianmacdonald.co.uk/">Ian Macdonald</a> took this picture of the canteen women at a blast furnace plant in Redcar, on the north-east coast of England, in 1983. He had been “embedded” at the ironworks for several months, following the shifts of a particular group of men at the plant. He didn’t take so many pictures in the canteen, but this is among his favourites – the cover image of the catalogue of his prints in a new exhibition of his work at the <a href="https://flowphotographic.gallery/ian-macdonald/">Flow Photographic Gallery</a> in London.</p><p>Talking about it, he recalls the freedom of that moment at the end of the women’s day, the chairs stacked, the floors mopped; that delicious brief licence to have a gossip and a laugh before heading home to kids and husbands and problems. Macdonald has always loved impressionist paintings, and you can maybe see some of that in the way the light falls on the teapots and crockery and the women’s easy smiles, the gestures of listening and half listening. That shared intimacy was part of a way of life that Macdonald had grown up with. “There was a dignity,” he says, “and it was about recognising that.”</p><p><a href="https://flowphotographic.gallery/ian-macdonald/">Ian Macdonald: Process, Environment and the Print</a> is at the Flow Photographic Gallery, London NW10 until 30 April</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jan/08/the-big-picture-tea-time-at-a-redcar-canteen-ian-macdonald">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘The umbrella of love and kindness carries on’: Actor Rory Kinnear on death, fairness – and playing scrabble with Judi Dench

<p>As he takes on his latest role as a northern community hero, Rory Kinnear talks about the traumatic early deaths of his father and sister – and the bittersweet joy of playing Tory MPs</p><p>In 2011, a Burnley businessman named Dave Fishwick established a lending company, Burnley Savings and Loans Limited. The 2008 financial crash had deprived the area of opportunity; small businesses were struggling to make ends meet. Fishwick, who grew up poor in Burnley, but who later set up a successful minivan business, began loaning money to locals, often people he knew by name. “It’s quite antediluvian in a way,” says the actor Rory Kinnear. “All the people he lends money to, he wants to meet them, see what they’re about.” Kinnear recently visited BSAL’s only branch, on a Burnley high street. “There’s a safe in the basement,” he says, incredulous. “Most of it is handwritten.”</p><p>Kinnear was in Burnley on a reconnaissance trip. When we meet, in a north London café that is blaring an up-tempo bossa nova playlist – an antidote to the December cold – it is to discuss his new film, <em>Bank of Dave</em>, in which he plays a lightly fictionalised version of Fishwick. “There was something about his tenacity of spirit and purpose,” Kinnear says, “as well as him being equally filled by rage and goodwill.” Rage at the banks, whose greed he loathed. Goodwill towards the people of Burnley, Fishwick’s people, whom he’d seen repeatedly passed over despite their promise and diligence. Fishwick’s father had worked two jobs to provide for the family. “That was Dave’s baseline,” Kinnear says. “You work <em>really</em> hard. But when you don’t see the benefits of that work flowing back through your community, when the success of the rest of the country doesn’t seem to trickle down, to use the phrase du jour, when you’re not treated fairly, or when you have the perception of not being treated fairly, that nobody gives a shit about you – that binds you as a community.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jan/08/actor-rory-kinnear-interview-bank-of-dave">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Equality has spawned a masculinity crisis, goes the theory.

<p>As the PM tries to move on from ‘perma-crisis’, agitated former ministers promise big trouble ahead</p><p>Senior Tories are warning Rishi Sunak that he is enjoying the “calm before the storm”, with his own MPs already plotting to tackle him over immigration and a beleaguered plan to secure “Brexit freedoms”.</p><p>The prime minister spent Saturday attempting to show his commitment to easing the crisis in the NHS – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/04/sunak-vows-to-be-steady-hand-on-tiller-but-are-his-pledges-all-sleight-of-hand">one of the five pledges</a> he made in his new year’s speech – by holding a summit with health services figures.

<p>Observe your critical voice to put distance between it and you – and remember that the most attractive women are those who carry themselves with pride</p><p><em><strong>The dilemma </strong>How can I be less self-conscious and less full of self-hatred about my untoned, middle-aged, sagging body when unclothed? This means I’m inhibited in many ways and avoid activities where I need to show my arms and, worse, my legs or my belly. I dread having to wear a swimming costume, even though I do enjoy swimming. It also means I don’t feel comfortable being naked with my partner during sex. It even affects which positions we take – I can’t bring myself to be on top as I feel so ashamed of my sagging belly and breasts.</em></p><p><em>I walk a lot, I go to yoga, I do Pilates and other classes several times a week, and love what my body can achieve in these classes. I’m almost 60 and have a good diet (no meat, plenty of fish, pulses, fruit and a wide range of vegetables). I am about 2st overweight and have struggled with this most of my life.</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/08/ask-philippa-perry-i-hate-my-ageing-body-why-do-i-look-at-myself-with-disgust">Continue reading...</a>

Recent Sundays have been in Australia, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and London, too. Wherever I am, Sunday is often a day off. I spend most of my time under the comforter in a hotel room, watching Netflix and drinking peppermint tea.</p><p><strong>And at home?</strong> Sleep, mostly. And hanging out with the kids in Atlanta. There’s always a schedule if they’re around: movies, sports, bowling… I’ve got an alley in my basement, that helps. Even then I’m not in the kitchen.
