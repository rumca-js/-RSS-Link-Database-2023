John McCain was the \"good\" Republican in 2008. Something I remember first hand, because McCain is one of the reasons I first became interested in politics. He was also my first introduction into who and what the media actually is. McCain was the \"good\" Republican in 2008 that the GOP had to nominate to stick it to the radical, far-right, talk radio choice... Mitt Romney. Let that one percolate. Then recap what happened four years later.</p><p>Within 48 hours of McCain getting the nomination, the media coverage was all about his age, his expensive shoes, and demanding he drops everything he was doing to call out any single person at a rally who made have said something mean about Barack Obama. Or held up a critical sign.</p><p>WaPo doesn't want Larry Hogan as the future of the GOP. They want him as a reliable stooge to attack anyone right-leaning on demand and to make things easier for the democrats.</p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!
