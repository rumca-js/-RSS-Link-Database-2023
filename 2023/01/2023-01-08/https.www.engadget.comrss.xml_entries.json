Between climate change, habitat destruction, pesticide use and attrition from diseases, one of the planet\u2019s most important pollinators has seen its numbers <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/06/19/733761393/more-bad-buzz-for-bees-record-numbers-of-honey-bee-colonies-died-last-winter\"><ins>decline dramatically in recent years</ins></a>. All of that bodes poorly for us humans. In the US, honeybees are essential to about one-third of the fruit and produce Americans eat.

A biotech firm named Dalan Animal Health recently developed a prophylactic vaccine to protect honeybees from American foulbrood disease.

Instead, administering the drug involves mixing it in with the queen feed worker bees eat. The vaccine then makes its way into the \u201croyal jelly\u201d the drones feed their queen. Her offspring will then be born with some immunity against the harmful bacteria.</p><p>The treatment represents a breakthrough for a few reasons.
