  <p id="5d2lOQ">Elon Musk has asked a judge to move an upcoming trial for a shareholder lawsuit out of San Francisco, citing concerns that the jury may have a bias against him, as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/07/elon-musk-attorneys-aim-to-move-trial-from-california-to-texas-citing-local-negativity.html">reported earlier by CNBC</a>. In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23566796-elon-musk-trial-location">a Friday filing</a>, Musk requests that the judge relocate the trial to West Texas due to the “local negativity” in the Bay Area surrounding Elon Musk and his businesses, preventing a fair trial.</p>
<p id="LGpJ2r">The shareholder class action lawsuit, which accuses Musk of manipulating Tesla’s stock, stems from the billionaire’s now-infamous 2018 tweet that claimed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/7/17661178/tesla-elon-musk-private-420-share-considering">he had the “funding secured”</a> to take Tesla private. Tesla’s stock <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/08/teslas-chaotic-year-after-musks-funding-secured-tweet.html">reached extreme highs and lows</a> in the weeks following the tweet, and resulted in a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/29/17918252/elon-musk-tesla-sec-securities-fraud-lawsuit-settlement-fine-penalty">$40 million fine from the Securities and Exchange...</a></p>

  <p id="x3PP4K">Apple’s getting ready to launch its long-rumored mixed reality headset this spring, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-01-08/when-will-apple-launch-the-reality-pro-mixed-reality-headset-apple-2023-devices-lcnfzkc7">a report from <em>Bloomberg</em>’s Mark Gurman</a>. The company’s reportedly planning to reveal the device ahead of the Worldwide Developers Conference in June and will start shipping it this fall.</p>
<p id="0dQmu2">The headset, which could <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/14/23404307/apple-headset-mixed-reality-rumor-iris-scanning-payments-login-biometric-authentication">cost as much as $3,000</a>, is expected to provide both virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) experiences using Apple’s new xrOS operating system. Gurman says Apple has already shown off the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/28/23326041/apple-trademark-filings-reality-branding-virtual-ar-vr-mixed-headset">Reality Pro-branded device</a> to “a small number of high-profile” developers so they can start creating third-party apps for it.</p>
