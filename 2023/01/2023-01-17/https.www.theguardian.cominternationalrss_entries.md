## Turn Every Page: a peek into Robert Caro and Robert Gottlieb’s long creative relationship

<p>In a new documentary directed by Gottleb’s daughter, the 50-year partnership between the acclaimed author and the renowned editor is examined</p><p>The director Lizzie Gottlieb was hosting a birthday party for her father, the renowned editor Robert Gottlieb at her Brooklyn brownstone when she struck up a conversation with one of the many guests. “A lovely older gentleman came up to me and said, ‘What do you think of the Barclay’s Center on Flatbush Avenue and how do you think it’ll affect the neighborhood?’ I started spouting completely uninformed, random opinions.” Mid-sentence, she came to a realization. “It was Robert Caro, and I was talking to him about New York City infrastructure.”</p><p>As one of the most respected living authors of the written word, 87-year-old Robert Caro has actually only authored six books, from The Power Broker, his 1974 opus about New York City planner Robert Moses to an epic, and still unfinished, series focusing on the life of President Lyndon Baines Johnson (more on that later). It’s a body of work that shines a stark spotlight on power; from the thirst some have for it, how they obtain it, and how the world – and the powerless at large – are shaped by their whims. As a result of his scrupulous and exhaustive research, vivid storytelling and poetic prose, Caro has become a cult figure. The latest facet of his lore is the new documentary Turn Every Page. Directed by Lizzie, it zeroes in on Caro’s creative relationship with his 91-year-old editor, Robert Gottlieb, who also happens to be Lizzie’s father.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/17/turn-every-page-documentary-robert-caro-robert-gottlieb-long-creative-relationship">Continue reading...</a>

## The Harbinger review – lockdown horror makes neat use of Covid-19

<p>Writer-director Andy Mitton inventively mashes up pandemic panic and supernatural danger to make a potent, truly creepy package</p><p>Horror as a genre is especially well suited to stories about isolated people in claustrophobic spaces. So it was kind of inevitable there would be a glut of features along those lines made during the most locked-down periods of the Covid-19 pandemic, when safety measures restricted cast and crew sizes as well as location use. And yet few of the resulting movies even mention Covid, let alone address the abundant anxieties and fears surrounding it all. Writer-director Andy Mitton’s simply executed feature – apparently shot in 2021 but set in the more dangerous, pre-vaccine months of 2020 – inventively mashes up pandemic panic and supernatural danger to make a potent, truly creepy horror package, garnished with naturalism and sly, strategic moments of humour. There are flaws, sure, and logical lacunae here and there, but it lingers in the memory long after the final credits roll.</p><p>Protagonist Mo (Gabby Beans, terrific) is snugly set up in a bubble with her father (Myles Walker) and brother (Ray Anthony Thomas) in a snow-lapped corner of upstate New York while the pandemic rages in the cities beyond. Out of the blue she gets a call from an old college friend, Mavis (Emily Davis, also excellent), who has no one else to turn to for help. Mavis is suffering from horrific nightmares which she struggles to wake up from even though she knows she’s dreaming and tries to self-harm to break the spell. Mo feels she owes Mavis a solid because of a good deed she did Mo years ago, so Mo risks travelling to Queens to stay with Mavis in an apartment block where every cough heard through the walls and ambulance heard in the distance foretells doom.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/17/the-harbinger-review-lockdown-horror-makes-neat-use-of-covid-19">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I do my best to relax her but now we only have sex when she initiates it</p><p><strong>My wife believes</strong><strong> it is her right to bring home all her work frustrations</strong><strong> and dump them on me. When she is stressed</strong><strong> she has no desire for sex</strong><strong> and we only have sex when she initiates it. I have discussed </strong><strong>th</strong><strong>is one-sidedness with her many times. </strong><strong>I’ve done things to help bring down her stress (massages, pampering, catering to her needs</strong><strong>) but these only help a little</strong><strong>. I am at the stage where I </strong><strong>feel numb and indifferent. What can I do?</strong></p><p>The state of a couple’s general relationship directly affects their sexual relationship, and the case of you and your wife illustrates that exactly. You are going overboard in trying to soothe and please her, but this is not attacking the root cause of her stress and is causing you to resent her. Stress in itself is likely to lower sexual desire, and this is compounded by her bringing those work frustrations home. It is reasonable to share problems with a partner and expect him to at least listen, but when it becomes too much of a burden, it’s time to set boundaries. Insist that she find self-soothing mechanisms for her stress, and take steps to help reduce her workload so that you are not bearing the brunt of it all. Numbness and indifference are symptoms of depression, which in itself can negatively affect a person’s sexual response.

<p>He held Mercury’s hand in hospital, retrieved Lennon from a cocaine escapade with David Bowie, and was upbraided by Keith Richards for smoking a joint. Now the Zelig of the music world is looking back</p><p>On the wall of Tony King’s flat in north London, there is a beautiful signed Andy Warhol print of Marilyn Monroe. There’s another inscription on the back, in a scrawl immediately familiar to anyone with a passing knowledge of the Beatles: “To Tony with love, from one of your problems, love John.”</p><p>An abashed Lennon gave it to him after a particularly raucous night in Los Angeles in the mid-1970s: drunk and furious after an altercation with Phil Spector during the recording of what became his 1975 album Rock ’n’ Roll, Lennon had smashed up the house where he was staying. King, who was essentially managing him at that point, arrived to find windows broken, gold records shattered and the singer attempting to pull a palm tree out of the ground. He intervened and ended up pinning Lennon to the ground: “I never knew you were so strong, dear,” Lennon quipped.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/17/tony-king-on-life-with-john-lennon-elton-john-and-freddie-mercury">Continue reading...</a>

## The Breakdown | Borthwick, Gatland and Jones have to pedal hard in new jobs – and quickly

<p>The coaching trio have no time to experiment as the race towards this year’s Rugby World Cup enters its final stages</p><p>It used to be said that preparing for the 2023 Rugby World Cup was a gradual process. People liked to paint it as a painstaking four-year project, with an emphasis on steady incremental gains. Then everyone panicked. England, Wales and Australia have new head coaches with blank (ish) sheets of paper and there is an Old Testament feel to what happened just weeks ago.</p><p>Because, suddenly, the marathon is a flat-out mass sprint. The three unions in question are banking on the ability of, respectively, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/19/steve-borthwick-england-rugby-union-head-coach-replace-eddie-jones">Steve Borthwick</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/05/warren-gatland-returns-to-wales-rugby-union-as-head-coach-with-wayne-pivac-sacked">Warren Gatland</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/16/eddie-jones-wallabies-coach-rugby-world-cup-2023-australia-dave-rennie-sacked">Eddie Jones</a> to accelerate their teams from 0-60 mph quicker than you can say Top Gear.

## Jack review – talking-penis comedy is coy with the knob gags

<p>Jack the talking penis introduces the ‘human male’ to whom he is attached. And so begins a juvenile student comedy that isn’t very comical</p><p>The penis has got a mind of its own, or so it’s said. Taking that idea one further, this juvenile low-budget British comedy gives a penis a voice, too. And a name: Jack. The thing is, if you go to the bother of giving a speaking role to a penis in a comedy, it really does need to be a funny talking penis, and poor Jack gets only a handful of so-so gags.</p><p>At the start of the film, Jack (voiced by director Pelayo de Lario) introduces us to his “human male”. This is Charlie (Luke Rollason), a third-year university student living at home with his mum and dad in suburban London. Charlie is desperate for a girlfriend (“Danny DeVito’s hairy left testicle pulls more than you,” jokes a mate). Charlie’s major crush is Canadian student Barbie (Angela Sant’Albano). But she thinks he’s gay following a spectacularly unhilarious misunderstanding. The acting in places feels comparable to a deodorant advert.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/17/jack-review-talking-penis-comedy-pelayo-de-lario">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s workers’ ability to maximise disruption that determines industrial power, rather than keeping people happy</p><p>On Boxing Day, I was informed by a relative that the sympathy he’d once had for the RMT union had evaporated after its decision to hold rail strikes over Christmas. My relative understood his change of heart to be of grave significance for the trade union. Prolonged disruption had turned people like him away, he warned, and that would cost the union dearly.</p><p>His position – that the outcome of an industrial dispute is in large part determined by the presence or absence of public support – is repeated <a href="https://www.thesocialreview.co.uk/2023/01/08/how-important-is-public-opinion-to-national-strikes/">throughout coverage</a> of the current wave of strikes.

<p>The pioneering electro, soul and jazz funk night united Black and white kids, bucked superstar DJ culture – and rivalled the Haçienda</p><p>For Sheffield’s music scene, 1985 was a year of change. Jarvis Cocker fell out of a window trying to impress a girl with a Spider-Man impression. Hospitalised and in a wheelchair, he had a lyrical epiphany that would change the fate of Pulp from cult outsiders to Britpop’s finest. Industrial-funk outfit Chakk signed a major deal and used the money to build FON studios, which produced countless hit records and effectively led to the birth of Warp Records.

<p>Fans have vented their frustration with banners and asked the players to show passion, but what will their efforts achieve?</p><p>I’ve been particularly enjoying the protest banners. Everton is a furious club right now, its fans and its ownership in open warfare, a mixture of rage and desperation and powerlessness. And yet for some reason all this anger seems to express itself in perfect, playful rhyming couplets. “Everton were magic, Kenwright is tragic.” “A football giant owned by a clown, all you’ll achieve is taking us down.” “A chairman who won’t let go, an under-qualified CEO.”</p><p>Only Everton fans, you feel, can capture an existential cry for help with the levity of a child’s nursery rhyme. I don’t propose to analyse the metre and scansion of the Everton banners in too much detail, but on some level I wonder whether the jauntiness of the medium is a subconscious counterpoint to the opacity and obfuscation of the Everton board, with their woolly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/14/everton-southampton-premier-league-board-safety-security-threat">“Official Statements”</a>, their anonymous briefings to favoured journalists, the intentionally imprecise messaging.

<p>Mauvignier sustains an almost unbearable tension as villagers in rural France stumble into a bloodbath</p><p>Only two of French writer <a href="https://fitzcarraldoeditions.com/authors/laurent-mauvignier">Laurent Mauvignier</a>’s 12 previous novels have appeared in English: <em>The Wound</em> (2015), about the Algerian war of independence, and <em>In the Crowd</em> (2008), which followed four groups of characters en route to Brussels ahead of the 1985 European Cup final between Liverpool and Juventus, drawing grisly voltage from the reader’s foreknowledge of the Heysel stadium disaster.<br /><br />Although Mauvignier’s new novel, <em>The Birthday Party</em>, deals wholly with fictitious events in the present day, its remorseless narrative logic likewise has us reading from behind our hands, as we watch its ensemble cast stumble into catastrophe. Patrice, a farmer in a remote French hamlet, has driven to the nearest town to stock up for an after-work celebration for his wife, Marion, turning 40; their daughter, Ida, is on her way home from school to get cake ready with an elderly neighbour, Christine – whose dog we’ve just witnessed being butchered by intruders who are about to take them both hostage.</p><p>Four hundred pages of agony remain. Our compulsion is basic but extreme: why is this happening? And what’s going to happen next? Amid the moment-by-moment dread emerges a knotty tale of two obscurely connected families, one superficially happy, the other luridly dysfunctional, as the pressure-cooker scenario brings the buried secrets of Marion’s premarital life – arson, abuse, murder – bubbling to the surface.</p><p><em>The Birthday Party</em> by Laurent Mauvignier, translated by Daniel Levin Becker, is published by Fitzcarraldo Editions (£16.99).

<p>A poet in Buenos Aires takes up teaching at a tough school and tries to protect his students in Diego Lerman’s cliched, if well-acted, tale </p><p>For all that it’s tremendously shot and vehemently acted, this movie from Argentinian director Diego Lerman – about a substitute teacher – is weirdly unsatisfying in terms of the story it has to tell: contrived, cliched, with secondary characters sketched in and a perfunctory and somewhat truncated car-chase climax.</p><p>Lucio (Juan Minujín) is a divorced poet and critic in Buenos Aires who winds up having to take a substitute teaching job in a tough inner-city school teaching literature to glowering kids (one of whom, inevitably, is a supernaturally talented rapper). Lucio’s dad, nicknamed “The Chilean” and played by the veteran Chilean actor Alfredo Castro, is a local community worker and cafe owner with connections to the mayor. Lucio’s dad is also a fierce enemy of a local drug-dealing mobster called El Perro, who reportedly has political ambitions of his own, and the Chilean employs Dylan (Lucas Arrua), a likable, smart kid from Lucio’s class, in his kitchen.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/17/the-substitute-review-contrived-inspiring-teacher-narrative-fails-test">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I was privileged to host international travellers wishing to work in exchange for lodgings but tighter entry rules have made it impossible</p><p>When I first heard about Workaway it sounded too good to be true, and perhaps in some ways it was: a website on which travellers could exchange their skills for free accommodation sounded like something that only happened in dreams. Perhaps that’s what appealed to me about it – the triumph of community over cash.</p><p>When I moved to a ramshackle Somerset cottage without enough skills to do the renovations myself, or money to pay tradespeople, I turned to Workaway for help.

<p>By demonising refugees, the home secretary causes divisions that can lead to tragedy. We must not forget the lessons of the past</p><p>At 83 years old, my going viral on the internet is the last thing I would have expected, but a video of me confronting the UK home secretary, Suella Braverman, at an event on Friday has so far been viewed more than 5m times. For a long time, I have listened in horror to the language used by many politicians to demonise certain groups in this country. As a child survivor of the Holocaust, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/14/suella-braverman-wont-apologise-to-holocaust-survivor-for-calling-migrants-invasion">I had to speak out</a>.</p><p>Let me tell you why. Next week, on 27 January, we commemorate one of the worst atrocities committed in human history. The theme for this year’s <a href="https://www.hmd.org.uk/">Holocaust Memorial Day</a> is “ordinary people”. This might seem a strange choice; after all, most of us would assume that it would require a population of inhuman monsters to enact a genocide.

Whether you’re worried about supplements, expense or food aversions, here’s everything you need to know</p><p>We all know why veganism is a good idea: it is better for the planet and can be better for our health, while animals shouldn’t be exploited to feed and clothe us. Each step towards the invention of good vegan cheese makes it slightly easier to make the switch.
