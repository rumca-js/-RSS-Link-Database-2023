<p>Getty Images, one of the power players in the stock-image market, is suing the owner of AI art tool Stable Diffusion for copyright infringement&mdash;a case that could help determine the limits of what AI art can legally generate.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/17/23558516/ai-art-copyright-stable-diffusion-getty-images-lawsuit&amp;xcust=2-1-1475597-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">unearthed by The Verge</a>, Getty is suing Stability AI, maker of Stable Diffusion, in a London court, claiming that Stability AI infringed the rights of copyright owned or represented by Getty Images. &ldquo;Getty&nbsp;Images&rsquo; position that Stability AI unlawfully copied and processed millions of images protected by copyright and the associated metadata owned or represented by Getty&nbsp;Images absent a license to benefit Stability AI&rsquo;s commercial interests and to the detriment of the content creators,&rdquo; Getty said in a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://newsroom.gettyimages.com/en/getty-images/getty-images-statement&amp;xcust=2-1-1475597-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">statement</a>.</p>



<p>In essence, Getty is claiming that Stability AI is benefiting from training its model on images published by Getty to the internet, without compensation. Getty images are published to the internet with a visible watermark; licensed images have the watermark removed. Getty said that Stability AI did not seek a license to use Getty&rsquo;s images. </p>



<p>What the suit will help establish is what an AI model can do with images that it finds on the public internet, especially those that are copyrighted. &ldquo;We think similarly these generative models need to address the intellectual property rights of others, that&rsquo;s the crux of it,&rdquo; Craig Peters, the chief executive of Getty Images, told The Verge. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;re taking this action to get clarity.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interestingly, Getty is not suing OpenAI, the creator of the original Dall-E and Dall-E 2 models, which used 400 million pairs of images and captions scraped from the internet&mdash;but without detailing who owned them. Instead, the company is suing Stability AI, the developer of the Stable Diffusion model that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/916785/creating-ai-art-local-pc-stable-diffusion.html">allows you to develop AI art </a>on your own PC. (Stable Diffusion is also available as a cloud hosted service on DreamStudio.ai.) The company does not explicitly say where it trained its model, but <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://dreamstudio.com/stablediffusion/&amp;xcust=2-1-1475597-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">notes</a> that generated images via Stable Diffusion 2 include an invisible watermark to label them as AI generated.</p>



<p>Conceivably, a ruling against Stability AI would block AI models from using copyrighted images without a license&mdash;either forcing Stability AI and other developers to pay licensing fees, or otherwise just eliminate copyrighted images from their training models. This would eliminate a significant number of training images from Stability&rsquo;s models, perhaps degrading the model&rsquo;s output. On the other hand, it would preserve the copyright of Getty and presumably those who had created their own, unique, copyrighted art.</p>



<p>The arguments made by both sides will presumably boil down to the concept of <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use&amp;xcust=2-1-1475597-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">fair use</a>, an idea, originated in U.S. law, which permits limited use of copyrighted material without having to first acquire permission from the copyright holder. It&rsquo;s a somewhat murky argument that tries to limit copyright to the benefit of the public, permitting parodies of copyrighted work but essentially outlawing musicians from sampling snippets of other artists without their permission. It also allows computer code to be reverse engineered. </p>



<p>However, since the suit is being filed in the UK, it will be tested against the UK&rsquo;s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_dealing_in_United_Kingdom_law&amp;xcust=2-1-1475597-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">&ldquo;fair dealing&rdquo; doctrine</a>, a version of &ldquo;fair use,&rdquo; but one which is less permissive. Once infringement is proven, the possible defense falls into one of three exceptions: where the use is for the purposes of research or private study, where it is to allow for criticism or review, and where it is for the purpose of reporting current events, according to Wikipedia. It also factors in how much of the copyrighted materials have been used.</p>



<p>Artists like Andy Warhol may emerge as central figures in the case. Warhol, a popular pop artist who died in 1987, was famous for taking established images&mdash;Campbell&rsquo;s soup cans or a photo of Marilyn Monroe, for example&mdash;and appropriating them into his own work.  Warhol&rsquo;s <em>Marilyn Diptych</em> took a Warner Bros. publicity still of Monroe, colorized it, and published it as his own work. According to Kate Donohue&rsquo;s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://journals.library.columbia.edu/index.php/lawandarts/announcement/view/112&amp;xcust=2-1-1475597-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">essay</a> in <em>The Columbia Journal of Law &amp; the Arts</em>, Warhol&mdash;and after his death, his foundation&mdash;was sued by artists arguing that Warhol had taken their photographs and adapted them under his own name. He settled with many of them. </p>



<p>Under the U.S. doctrine of fair use, the question would be whether Warhol&rsquo;s work was &ldquo;transformative&rdquo; enough to slide through the fair use loophole, and whether the point of AI art is transformative by nature. In the UK, however, Stability AI may have a more limited defense. Either way, it&rsquo;s likely that the UK court will help decide what AI art can and cannot do with copyrighted works, helping define that future of AI in the arts.</p>

<p>Recently, I played the ever-loving crap out of a city-building game called <em>Farthest Frontier</em>. It wasn&rsquo;t long before I started feeling shooting pains along the length of my mouse hand. Like most people, I use a standard run-of-the-mill PC mouse. There&rsquo;s nothing real special or ergonomic about it. However, after days of hand cramps and sharp pains, I started looking into vertical mice. If you&rsquo;re not sure what they are, join the club. I had no idea up until a week or so ago. Let&rsquo;s venture down this rabbit hole together then.</p>



<h2 id="so-what-the-heck-is-a-vertical-mouse">So, what the heck is a vertical mouse?</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Anker vertical mouse" class="wp-image-1471453" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Untitled-design-9-6.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Anker</p></div>



<p>Vertical mice are designed to keep your hand in a more natural position, which reduces strain on your wrist. It stands upright and the buttons and scroll wheel are located on the side instead of the top. This encourages you to move your elbow instead of your wrist. Many of them even include a DPI button that changes the mouse speed. Interestingly enough, vertical mice have been around since 1994. Who knew?</p>



<p>They were invented by Jack Lo, who came up with the design after experiencing pain from using a traditional mouse. The &ldquo;handshake design&rdquo; helps eliminate any arm twisting. It took him a long while to license his invention, though. Microsoft even rejected him at one point. After finding a contract manufacturer in Asia to help him produce his product, his first vertical mouse, the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://evoluent.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1471403-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Evoluent VerticalMouse</a>, was finally released in late 2002.

<h2 id="vertical-versus-flat">Vertical versus flat</h2>



<p>So, what are the benefits of using a vertical mouse over a horizontal one? A vertical mouse puts your hand in a neutral handshake position. Essentially, it allows you to use the mouse with your forearm instead of your wrist. This position also prevents you from turning your wrist, which reduces pressure on the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.osmosis.org/answers/median-nerve#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20median%20nerve,hand%20and%20digits%20(fingers).&amp;xcust=2-1-1471403-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">median nerve</a>. It&rsquo;s supposed to lessen muscle soreness and arm pain, especially if you&rsquo;re doing a lot of scrolling. It may even help those who suffer from <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/carpal-tunnel-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20355603#:~:text=Carpal%20tunnel%20syndrome%20is%20caused,in%20the%20hand%20and%20arm.&amp;xcust=2-1-1471403-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">carpal tunnel syndrome</a>.</p>



<p>Most people use flat mice. I&rsquo;ve been using one since I was tall enough to reach a computer desk. That said, now that I&rsquo;m in my mid-thirties, I&rsquo;m noticing a lot of discomfort after using one for long periods of time. Unlike the vertical variety, you operate a flat mouse by moving your wrist and not your forearm. Frequently twisting your arm and using the scroll wheel in a repetitive fashion can result in hand pain and discomfort. I&rsquo;m no medical doctor, but having experienced this kind of pain firsthand, I can tell you it really sucks.</p>



<h2 id="should-you-buy-one">Should you buy one?</h2>



<p>That&rsquo;s entirely up to you! If you&rsquo;re experiencing a lot of pain and hand cramping from a flat mouse, then picking up a more ergonomic peripheral just makes sense. I&rsquo;m not going to stop playing the heck out of those city-builder games anytime soon, so I might as well pick up a vertical mouse for those marathon gaming sessions of mine. I&rsquo;m not getting any younger (boo) either and I don&rsquo;t want to be in pain every day. If a vertical mouse is the potential solution to that problem, then maybe it&rsquo;s high time I give it a whirl. PCWorld editor Alaina Yee <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/782535/logitech-lift-review.html">gives high marks to the Logitech Lift vertical</a>, which comes in both right- and left-hand options. I&rsquo;ll start there. </p>

## Keychron adds wireless to its awesome Q-series boards

<p>Kechron&rsquo;s Q-series keyboards are shockingly good, not just in and of themselves, but in terms of value versus the usual super-premium designs. Check out <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/823922/keychron-q5-mechanical-keyboard-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">one of</a> <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1364305/keychron-q8-review-a-quality-keyboard-for-the-ergo-riche.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">our reviews</a> for more details, but to sum it up: awesome aluminum construction, huge amounts of customization, plenty of layout options, and wide-open programming with VIA and QMK. The one thing the line has been missing is wireless powers. Today, Keychron addresses that lack with the Q1 Pro. </p>



<p>Keychron has been making wireless boards for years, of course, mostly separate from its high-end designs. But it says that it&rsquo;s finally cracked how to keep a stable wireless connection through several pounds of milled aluminum. Visually identical to the current, wired-only Q1 keyboard, the Q1 Pro preserves its popular 75% layout, programmable dial, the dual-gasket mount, and hot-swappable key switches. The only fundamental change to the design is replacing the metal switch plate with a polycarbonate one for &ldquo;more flex&rdquo; (and possibly better wireless signal in an otherwise all-metal box).</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Keychron Q1 Pro wireless keyboard " class="wp-image-1474547" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/keychron-Q1-pro.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Keychron</p></div>



<p>Speaking of wireless, the design includes Bluetooth 5.1 for quick connections to up to three devices and a 4000mAh battery that should last for months if you turn off the RGB lighting. In Bluetooth mode, the polling rate is 90Hz, but if you need something faster for your Counter-Strike matches, plug in the USB-C cable for 1000Hz and N-key rollover capabilities. </p>



<p>The Q1 Pro is <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/keytron/1826960830?ref=5kivu7&amp;token=5c07c270&amp;xcust=2-1-1474545-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">launching today as a Kickstarter project</a>, as is Keychron&rsquo;s wont. Deliveries will go out in April, which is also when the keyboard will be available for direct purchase. Barebones (no switches or keycaps) versions start at $179 with the fully-assembled version topping out at $199 (with a slight discount for Kickstarter early birds). Color options include black, aluminum, and white, with cyan, purple, and orange accent keys, respectively. </p>



<p>Expect Keychron to roll out wireless &ldquo;Pro&rdquo; models for its other Q keyboards in the future, assuming sales are solid. </p>

## Stadia’s parting gift is a Bluetooth controller upgrade

<p>The bell tolls for Google&rsquo;s Stadia streaming game service, which <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1338418/rip-stadia-google-gives-up-its-game-streaming-ghost.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">shuts its servers down tomorrow, January 18th</a>. Google has already begun refunding Stadia players for their purchases on the digital platform, just over three years after its official launch. But dedicated players who invested in Stadia hardware &mdash; what little there is for the cloud-based service &mdash; have a surprise coming. The official Stadia controller, previously restricted to direct Wi-Fi connections, is getting a Bluetooth upgrade. </p>



<p>This is a bit confusing. See, the Stadia controller connects directly to a Wi-Fi access point instead of a console or PC, in order to reduce latency on the cloud service. It&rsquo;s possible to use it with a direct USB connection, too, which turns it into a wired PC controller. But despite having Bluetooth hardware on its wireless chip, Google never actually enabled Bluetooth connections, making the controller&rsquo;s utility for other platforms limited. </p>



<p>According to an official post on the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://community.stadia.com/t5/Stadia-General/A-Gift-from-the-Stadia-Team-amp-Bluetooth-Controller/m-p/85936#M34875&amp;xcust=2-1-1474549-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Stadia community forum</a> (via <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://9to5google.com/2023/01/13/stadia-controller-bluetooth-support/&amp;xcust=2-1-1474549-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>), Google will make a tool available later this week to update the controller with Bluetooth connections enabled. Presumably, this will make it compatible with the usual unbranded, generic Bluetooth controller standard, widely-used by Windows and Android &mdash; compatibility with specific game consoles might be trickier. The Stadia controller, which uses a PlayStation-style layout, has been well-received since the launch of the game service. </p>



<p>Not so for Stadia itself. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/797253/google-stadia-review-2.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">From the very start</a>, Google&rsquo;s well-earned reputation for shutting down services even when they were popular was a sword of Damocles hanging over the game streaming platform. A relatively small selection of games made it hard to recommend for anyone who already had a PC or console, and a lack of all-you-can-eat library options let competition from Nvidia&rsquo;s GeForce Now and Microsoft&rsquo;s Xbox Game Pass steal Google&rsquo;s thunder. </p>

<p>Intel&rsquo;s newest 13th-generation CPUs like the i9 13900K bring with them a refreshed set of Z790 motherboards. Intel is looking to flex one big advantage over its AMD competition: DDR4 and lower platform costs overall.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here comes the MSI Z790 Edge WiFi DDR4, promising to fulfill that very promise. With a unique silver design to differentiate it from the usual &ldquo;motherboard&rdquo; aesthetic, it looks pretty good, too. The features are there to back it up such as fast USB ports and plenty of M.2 slots.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ll go over the specs, features, performance, and design aesthetics. Should it be on your list of motherboards to pair with your freshly acquired CPU? Let&rsquo;s find out!</p>



<h2 id="msi-z790-edge-wifi-ddr4-the-specs">MSI Z790 Edge WiFi DDR4: The specs</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI Z790 Edge Wifi DDR4" class="wp-image-1447995" height="688" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2022-11-21-at-5.38.25-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The MSI Z790 Edge WiFi DDR4 comes with a pre-installed I/O shield.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>The MSI Z790 Edge WiFi DDR4 has a few of its specs listed right in its name: WiFi is standard, and DDR4 is the RAM type. The latter is important, because DDR5 has had higher initial costs and diminishing performance returns in many cases&mdash;so those looking to save a buck can reuse a DDR4 kit or pick up one cheap.</p>



<p>You&rsquo;ll also be able to use Intel&rsquo;s 12th-generation Alder Lake CPUs such as the 12600K&mdash;with equal support for Intel&rsquo;s newer 13th-generation as well.</p>



<p>The unboxing experience is no-frills, but that&rsquo;s to be expected with an MSRP of $369. Most of the fancy packaging comes with a much higher price tag&mdash;think MSI Godlike models. You&rsquo;ll get the standard included accessories such as a WiFi antenna, cable stickers, and SATA cables. The I/O shield is pre-installed, just like we love seeing!</p>



<ul><li>ATX form factor&nbsp;</li><li>Support for Intel 12th- and 13th-gen CPUs</li><li>16+1+1 Phase VRM with 90A Smart Power Stage</li><li>DDR4 RAM, dual channel up to 4 DIMMs up to 128GB</li><li>5x onboard M.2 slots (PCIe Gen 4)&nbsp;</li><li>2x PCIe 16x slot (1x is PCIe Gen 5)&nbsp;</li><li>HDMI and DisplayPort out&nbsp;</li><li>10 USB ports on back Including 20Gb/s&nbsp;</li><li>Intel 2.5GbE LAN</li><li>Intel Wi-Fi 6E&nbsp;</li><li>RGB headers for Mystic Light</li><li>7 SATA 6Gb/s ports&nbsp;</li><li>8 PWM fan headers&nbsp;</li><li>BIOS Flashback and Clear CMOS</li><li>Preinstalled I/O shield&nbsp;</li><li>Realtek 7.1 ALC 4080 audio&nbsp;</li><li>MSRP $369</li></ul>



<h2 id="msi-z790-edge-wifi-ddr4-features">MSI Z790 Edge WiFi DDR4: Features</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI Z790 Edge Wifi DDR4" class="wp-image-1447996" height="872" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2022-11-21-at-5.39.21-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>A $369 MSRP used to get you a lot further back in the day, but in today&rsquo;s ever increasing price landscape, costs are up. That&rsquo;s why the MSI Z790 Edge is an interesting choice&mdash;it brings next-generation performance of Intel&rsquo;s 13th-gen CPUs, while allowing some flexibility with DDR4. You can reuse your existing kit or pick up one cheaper than DDR5 on average for minimal performance loss.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You&rsquo;re not skimping on any features here, either. For both content creators and gamers, you&rsquo;re loaded with fast USB ports: 20Gb/s USB is here, and while we&rsquo;d love to see 40Gb/s USB4 or Thunderbolt 4, as commonly found on high-end units, the I/O is still very fast.&nbsp;</p>



<p>M.2 PCIe Gen 4 support is vast, with up to five available slots. Sure, you&rsquo;re not getting the PCIe Gen 5 theoretical speeds, but there aren&rsquo;t drives that can really take advantage of that currently anyway. SATA hard drive users can have up to seven SATA slots: Storage options are bountiful here.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s great to see MSI including some &ldquo;quality-of-life&rdquo; upgrades with screwless M.2 slots and the integrated I/O shield. Bravo!&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the networking side, Z790 gives you Intel&rsquo;s 2.5GbE LAN and Wi-Fi 6E, nothing to complain about here. If you&rsquo;re after 10GbE networking, you&rsquo;re going to have to step up to a much more expensive motherboard&mdash;but that&rsquo;s expected.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI Z790 Edge Wifi DDR4" class="wp-image-1447997" height="608" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2022-11-21-at-5.37.46-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The MSI Z790 Edge WiFi DDR4 has a decent number of PCIe slots including PCIe Gen 5.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>You do have two 16x PCIe slots for your GPU and other add-on cards, with the top slot being PCIe Gen 5. Be mindful of the slots as they can share PCIe lanes with the M.2 slots, some are from the CPU such as the top 16x, and some from the chipset.</p>



<p>You&rsquo;ll also have good audio connectivity in the back, with Realtek&rsquo;s ALC 4080 codec. Clear CMOS and BIOS Flashback buttons are there too, along with a &ldquo;Debug&rdquo; LED to diagnose issues. Overall, great features for the price!</p>



<h2 id="msi-z790-edge-wifi-ddr4-design">MSI Z790 Edge WiFi DDR4: Design</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI Z790 Edge Wifi DDR4" class="wp-image-1448000" height="583" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2022-11-21-at-5.40.01-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The silver accenting on the MSI Z790 Edge WiFi DDR4 is a bit muted, but looks really slick in a full build.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>The MSI Z790 Edge WiFi DDR4&rsquo;s design immediately jumps out at you: silver-ish, almost white looking in some lighting&mdash;and it makes for a very attractive motherboard. It&rsquo;s a refreshing change from the  more monochrome looks of most designs, and MSI adds some nice inlays and graphics to complete the look. It&rsquo;s a nice option for those looking to escape the typical build aesthetic.</p>



<p>Some of its cool looks also serve a functional purpose. The M.2 &ldquo;Frozr&rdquo; slot covers have thermal pads to keep them cool. We also appreciate how the battery is exposed, and not underneath dozens of screws and a cover&mdash;makes things easy when you have to swap it out!</p>



<p>You get RGB headers to take advantage of MSI&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mystic Light&rdquo; system, and the I/O shroud sports a nicely RGB&rsquo;ed MSI Dragon. Otherwise, the aesthetics are clean and straightforward.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI Z790 Edge Wifi DDR4" class="wp-image-1448001" height="885" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2022-11-21-at-5.38.18-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The <p>MSI Z790 Edge WiFi DDR4 backside.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>The board&rsquo;s backside is uneventful, but par for the price&mdash;reinforced backplates typically are found on more expensive models. The 16x slots on the front, however, do have what MSI calls &ldquo;Steel Armor,&rdquo; reinforcing them for heavy modern graphics card support.</p>



<p>The integrated I/O shield is a nice touch too&mdash;and makes for a very clean I/O area with clearly labeled USB ports and other connectivity. Overall, a functional and attractive design that differs from the usual options with its more silver-centric color scheme.</p>



<h2 id="msi-z790-edge-wifi-ddr4-performance-software-and-bios">MSI Z790 Edge WiFi DDR4: Performance, software, and BIOS</h2>



<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, DDR4 does fine! Of course, DDR5 will have the &ldquo;edge&rdquo; with its much faster kits available, but it&rsquo;s unlikely you&rsquo;ll ever notice the difference save in benchmarking. DDR4 is typically more than enough, even with the 13900K, and you&rsquo;ll save a buck too.</p>



<p>Speaking of the 13900K, that CPU will pair nicely with this motherboard, and its 16+1+1 VRMs. You&rsquo;ll likely be more limited by the cooling on the CPU itself before anything else, as these new hotrods run especially hot by design. The motherboard itself will be able to handle it, along with any other 12th- or 13th-gen CPU that you throw at it.</p>



<p>PCIe Gen 4 performance on the M.2 slots will also adequately handle even the top-class M.2 drives, as saturating PCIe Gen 4, not to mention Gen 5, is still a ways away. The M.2 &ldquo;Frozr&rdquo; slot covers will keep them cool, too. You&rsquo;ll still get a PCIe Gen 5 GPU 16x slot, however&mdash;which is superfluous as even the RTX 4090 is still only Gen 4.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you want to tweak things a bit, the MSI BIOS is nicely organized and gives you access to virtually any nuanced adjustments you&rsquo;d wish to make. Set XMP profiles for the DDR4, change boot drive order, update your BIOS, and various CPU tweaks. You can also choose to just let the motherboard do the automatic CPU control and simply set XMP&mdash;we&rsquo;d recommend at least that to get the most out of your DDR4.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI Z790 Edge Wifi DDR4" class="wp-image-1448002" height="743" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2022-12-23-at-1.22.19-PM-1.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>MSI Center BIOS software.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">MSI</p></div>



<p>Leaving the BIOS, we also have the new MSI Center software. It&rsquo;s an integrated approach to control various elements of your PC. You&rsquo;ll get Mystic Light RGB control over the motherboard itself and various peripherals, alongside driver software updates. You can also set fan curves and profiles with &ldquo;user scenario,&rdquo; and there&rsquo;s some hardware monitoring too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MSI is taking a similar &ldquo;all in one&rdquo; approach as Asus&rsquo;s Armoury Crate software. While motherboard software has always been a bit hit or miss in the past, it seems to be improving recently. For some important functions, we&rsquo;d still recommend either trusting the BIOS, or using dedicated third-party software such as for hardware monitoring.</p>



<h2 id="should-you-buy-the-msi-z790-edge-wifi-ddr4">Should you buy the MSI Z790 Edge WiFi DDR4?</h2>



<p>Coming in at $369, the MSI Z790 Edge WiFi DDR4 packs enough features and performance to please both gamers and content creators, and lacks very little in terms of what&rsquo;s expected at this price class. While we&rsquo;d like to see the DDR4 version cheaper, it still offers next-gen tech by way of the 13th-gen CPU support and PCIe Gen 5.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You&rsquo;ll appreciate the nice aesthetics, too. The silver design looks great and will appeal to those who want a departure from the usual drab monochromatic look. It can fit in nicely with either white- or silver-centric themed builds!&nbsp;</p>



<p>With plenty of USB ports and other I/O, not to mention a bevy of storage options with M.2 and SATA, it&rsquo;s a well-rounded package. Supporting all the way up to the mighty Intel i9 13900K, you&rsquo;ll be  set for performance here. </p>
