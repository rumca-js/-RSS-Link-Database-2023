The video features interviews with actors Pedro Pascal, Nico Parker, Bella Ramsey, and Merle Dandridge, as well as executive producers Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin. You can watch it below.</p><div>          </div><p>The video itself mostly goes over the plot and emotional beats of the pilot, with the actors and writers commenting on the action and showing off behind-the-scenes footage. For example, Nico Parker, who plays Joel's birth daughter Sarah, remarks on the series' use of practical effects, saying, \"you could really immerse yourself because it was all there in front of you.\" Craig Mazin remarks on the difficult position Nico Parker was in as a performer, saying, \"It was important for us to present the audience with a Sarah that we felt we could follow for the rest of the series.\"</p><p>Merle Dandridge, who also played Marlene in the original game, discuses growing into playing the role again. \"It's another thing to step in front of the camera and embody her with my own instrument. I had a couple of things on my side... I aged into her a little bit and I guess my deep passion and love for her.\" Though she didn't think that they would cast her, as soon as she heard about the show, she wanted in. In the video, she says, \"I don't remember when I first heard about [the show], but when I did I was like 'Mommy want that.'\"</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/go-behind-the-scenes-of-hbos-the-last-of-us-pilot-in-a-new-video/1100-6510645/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/one-piece-odyssey-review-filler-arc/1900-6418018/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "One Piece Odyssey Review - Filler Arc", "date_published": "2023-01-17 22:44:00+00:00", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">For decades, the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy and the Straw Hat Pirates have thrilled and enchanted readers and viewers across the globe. Turning such a beloved and long-running action-adventure series into game form has proven to be quite a challenge, with many developers stepping up over the years to try and gamify the magic that's made the One Piece anime and manga such a success, often to mixed results. One Piece Odyssey is the latest such attempt, and it takes the approach of transforming One Piece's dramatic battles into a turn-based RPG. While it does a solid job of getting the look and mood of the series down, One Piece Odyssey unfortunately offers little more than a very basic RPG adventure.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The game opens with the Straw Hat gang stranded on the mysterious island of Waford. Their ship, Thousand Sunny, lies in a wreck nearby and with no obvious way to repair it, the gang sets out exploring this wild new world. A strange young girl named Lim emerges and, fearful of the pirates, she removes all of the crew's strength and special powers. With the help of Adio, a rather suspicious adventurer who calls the island his home, the Straw Hats set out to recover their powers, learn the secrets of Waford Island, and escape to journey another day. Along the way, they'll also be able to relive the great adventures of the past.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"> </p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/one-piece-odyssey-review-filler-arc/1900-6418018/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/company-of-heroes-3-pc-preorders-are-discounted-right-now/1100-6510639/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Company of Heroes 3 PC Preorders Are Discounted Right Now", "date_published": "2023-01-17 21:45:00+00:00", "description": "<p>You can preorder Sega and New Relic\u2019s upcoming strategy game <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/company-of-heroes-3-digital-premium-edition\">Company of Heroes 3</a> at a discount through Fanatical--and if you act fast, you can even get extra coupon codes or a bonus free game with your purchase.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The deal brings the Company of Heroes 3 <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/company-of-heroes-3\">digital Launch edition</a> down to $52.79 (normally $60), and the <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/company-of-heroes-3-digital-premium-edition\">digital Premium edition</a> to just $70.39 (normally $80).

Indeed, Dungeons &amp; Dragons' dominance of the market is so complete that you could argue that most D&amp;D players don't even realize that there is an alternative--similar to Pokemon and its imitators.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">However, in recent weeks, D&amp;D brand owner Wizards of the Coast has done nearly all it can to incense and repulse the players and partners that support it--and according to one <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/dungeons-dragons-wizards-hasbro-ogl-open-game-license-1849981136\">report</a>, it apparently took a wave of canceled subscriptions to finally convince the company to reverse course. So, what was the source of the conflict, and why were so many loyal D&amp;D fans ready to jump ship to lesser-known competitors like Pathfinder and 13th Age? As usual, it has to do with money and market dynamics, and for a lot of D&amp;D players, it might be a case of too little, too late.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Humble beginnings</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">When Dungeons &amp; Dragons was introduced in 1974, it was the world's first commercially available tabletop role-playing game, and it made the most of that head start. While some things have changed over the years, D&amp;D has always enjoyed a massive slice of the market, and its 5th edition (now almost a decade old) has seen the largest boom of popularity in the hobby's venerable history. Late last year, when Wizards of the Coast announced the follow-up to 5e, titled \"One D&amp;D,\" some fans worried that Wizards would take a more proprietary approach to licensing third-party D&amp;D content in order to drive more revenue to parent company Hasbro.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-dd-world-is-on-fire-right-now-and-wizards-of-the-coast-can-only-blame-itself/1100-6510643/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-buy-slashes-prices-on-games-laptops-tvs-and-more/2900-4584/", "title": "Best Buy Slashes Prices On Games, Laptops, TVs, And More", "date_published": "2023-01-17 21:32:00+00:00", "description": "<p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1702/17023653/4087376-callisto%282%29.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Best Buy always seems to be offering hundreds of items at a discount, but this week is a bit more special than most.

This event includes multiple arcade modes, including Capture the Flag and Bounty Hunter.

There is the regular version and a blitz version, with the blitz mode featuring closer spawn points for the flags, making for a faster version. There is also a competitive version of the mode that was added at the start of the week and will be available for the rest of Season 2, letting players enjoy an intense version of Capture the Flag where they can climb the competitive ranks.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The other arcade mode is the free-for-all Bounty Hunter mode. The first person to record a kill gets a bounty placed on their head. While you have the bounty on you, you gain additional points for getting kills, but you are visible to all other players on the map. If you kill the person with the bounty on them, it gets transferred to you. As with previous events, there are challenges based on these arcade modes, with the legendary Kkachi Echo skin available as a free reward.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-year-of-the-rabbit-event-all-skins-twitch-drops-and-arcade-modes/1100-6510640/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-is-celebrating-the-lunar-new-year-with-a-new-event/1100-6510641/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Overwatch 2 Is Celebrating The Lunar New Year With A New Event", "date_published": "2023-01-17 20:46:00+00:00", "description": "<p>Blizzard has announced a Lunar New Year event for <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/\">Overwatch 2</a>.

Earlier in January, Ubisoft canceled <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-surprised-by-lackluster-sales-of-mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope/1100-6510517/\">several unnamed projects and delayed Skull and Bones yet again</a>.

Delays in combination with lower sales have put the company in a bad financial spot. CEO Yves Guillemot sent an email to Ubisoft staff, which was obtained by <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-skull-bones-delay-assassins-creed-far-cry-cuts-1849975925\">Kotaku</a>. In the email, Guillemot urged employees to work hard and be frugal. He said, \"Today more than ever, I need your full energy and commitment to ensure we get back on the path to success. I am also asking each of you to be especially careful and strategic with your spending and initiatives, to ensure we\u2019re being as efficient and lean as possible.\"</p><p>In response, the Ubisoft Paris chapter of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SolInfoJeuVideo/status/1615263954955116546/photo/2\">Solidaries Informatique released a statement</a>. Solidaries Informatique is a trade union, encompassing several tech companies in France. The statement claims that Guillemot's words urge employees to give into \"managerial pressure\" and work \"overtime.\" It also hints at the future possibilities of layoffs, studio closures, and salary cuts.

Both follow-ups maintained that navel-gazing tone, commenting on and subverting as many sequel and trilogy tropes as possible.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">And then it was over, or so we thought. But Craven and writer Kevin Williamson released the quite good Scream 4 in 2011, this time going after remake and reboot conventions with a plot that paralleled the original film while still taking things in a new direction. After Craven died in 2015 it seemed like the series might have actually ended for good, but in 2022 we got a fifth film from Devil's Due directors Tyler Gillet and Matt Bettinelli-Olpin. It was one of the best movies in the series, it performed well at the box office despite a simultaneous streaming release, and Scream 6 was put on the fast track.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/scream-6-latest-trailer-casting-announcements-and-everything-we-know/1100-6510622/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/julia-louis-dreyfus-really-wants-to-do-some-fighting-in-the-mcu/1100-6510623/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Julia Louis-Dreyfus Really Wants To Do Some Fighting In The MCU", "date_published": "2023-01-17 17:53:00+00:00", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">After making her surprise MCU debut in Falcon and The Winter Soldier, TV icon Julia Louis-Dreyfus (Seinfled, Veep) is beyond stoked for her role in the upcoming Thunderbolts.

It's the follow-up to Fire Emblem: Three Houses, and while it doesn't have all of that game's social connection elements or three separate campaigns, it introduces a new element in the form of Emblems--ghost-like manifestations of Fire Emblem heroes from other worlds. This pays homage to the series' long history, and impacts both the story and gameplay in big ways. So how long can you expect this latest anime-inspired adventure to last?</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">How long is Fire Emblem Engage?</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">There are dozens of main story chapters in Fire Emblem Engage, along with several Paralogues. Many of these Paralogue missions focus on unlocking the Max Bond Level for your Emblems after defeating them in combat, and will become available as the story progresses. In our experience, completing the full story campaign and all of the Paralogue missions will take roughly 50 hours.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">However, that estimate can vary greatly depending on your settings. For example, the 50-hour estimate is based on playing on Normal difficulty with Classic battle settings--which includes perma-death for your units. That will naturally make you more cautious than playing on Casual battle settings, in which units who fall in battle leave to \"rest\" and are restored for the next battle. Classic may also prompt you to try a battle several times until you make it out with all your favorite fighters intact. And of course, a player set to Normal difficulty will probably breeze through faster than one set to Hard or Maddening.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fire-emblem-engage-how-long-to-beat/1100-6510617/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/mandalorian-season-3-trailer-breakdown-easter-eggs-references-and-so-many-droids/2900-4582/", "title": "Mandalorian Season 3 Trailer Breakdown: Easter Eggs, References, And So Many Droids", "date_published": "2023-01-17 16:57:00+00:00", "description": "<p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4087194-0.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>It's been a long time since we hung with Mando, as the previous season of the show wrapped up more than two years ago<a href=\"https://youtu.be/RCN6eRVav5k?t=21\">.</a> But don't worry because The Mandalorian Season 1 returns to Disney+ on March 1. The critically-acclaimed Star Wars series recently revealed its <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-mandalorian-rides-once-again-in-new-trailer-for-season-3/1100-6510602/\">first trailer for the upcoming episodes</a>, and boy oh boy, it's a lot to take in.</p><p>Mando (Din Djarin) is working together with numerous other Mandalorians, some we've seen before and some that are brand-new to the series. He'll be travelling to new worlds and meeting new people--as well as reuniting with fan-favorites on the series like Greef Karga--who doesn't love Carl Weathers?</p><p>Season 3 of Mandalorian will seemingly pick up after the events of The Book of Boba Fett Season 1--as the latter half of that show certainly felt like The Mandalorian Season 2.5. The latest episodes of Mando will feature Predro Pescal as the titular Mandalorian, the aforementioned Weathers, Amy Sedaris, Katee Sackhoff, Emily Swallow, and Giancarlo Esposito. Reportedly, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/christopher-lloyd-joins-mandalorian-season-3-report/1100-6501736/\">Christopher Lloyd has also joined the cast</a>.</p><p>Going through the new trailer, there are a lot of references to other elements of the Star Wars Universe, as this season seemingly brings nomadic Mandalorians back to their home planet, with the hopes of taking it back--again. Additionally, there's a lot of familiar droids here as well and maybe even a few Easter eggs you missed.</p><p>Below, you'll find a breakdown of the first Mandalorian Season 3 trailer, and everything we saw that gives us a better idea of what the new episodes will be about when they arrive on <a href=\"https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/1804712/564546/9358?u=https://www.disneyplus.com/&amp;subid1=subid_value&amp;sharedid=gamespot\">Disney+</a> on March 1.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. Mandalorians united</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4087195-1.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>\"Our people are scattered, like stars in the galaxy. What are we? What do we stand for?\" Mando says this as we see a group of Mandalorians together--seemingly new members of the group we have yet to see on the series.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. Helmet colors</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4087196-2.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-mandalorian-episode-3-easter-eggs-and-referenc/2900-3230/\">We've talked about this before</a>. The color of your armor has significant meaning in Mandalorian culture. There is one person with an orange helmet. That means they have a lust for life--no, not the Iggy Pop song. They want or have achieved freedom in some way.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">There are also two Mandalorians in white helmets. This is actually an Imperial political movement called Cin Vhetin, a group that wanted the Empire forces off of Mandalore. They were violents and considered to be terrorists by the Empire and even Imperial supporters on their own planet. The white indicates purity or a fresh start.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">We also see some other colors which have meaning in Mandalorian culture: green (Duty), red (honoring a parent), and gold (vengeance).</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. New planet, same type of protocol droid</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4087197-3.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Mando and Grogu are on a new planet, checking things out. And if you look in the background, you'll see a 3PO-series protocol droid--yes, the very same that C-3PO is. This is considered an older droid, as these models were built during the Invasion of Naboo--so during The Phantom Menace. These droids were created to be translators and are fluent in over 6 million forms of communication.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. Another familiar face</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4087198-4.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Briefly, we see a creature in a tree, and if it looks familiar it's because the species has appeared in another movie--Return of the Jedi. This is a Kowakian monkey-lizard, and in the Star Wars universe, they're treated as pets, even though they are very intelligent and capable of using tools--or weapons. The most notable one of these species is Salacious B. Crumb, who lived in Jabba's palace.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5 More notable droids</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4087199-5.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">On the left, behind Mando, is an astromech droid, an R5-unit to be more specific. They're used in spaceships as co-pilots, essentially.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">On the right with the two light-up eyes is an EV-series supervisor droid. The most notable one of these was EV-9D9, who worked in Jabba's palace, then found itself working as a bartender on Tatooine in a previous season of Mandalorian.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. Mandalore</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4087200-6.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Mando mentions he's headed to Mandalore, to be forgiven for his transgressions. We then see a destroyed structure. For years and years, Mandalore has been a battleground. There's been multiple civil wars, the Imperial occupation, and much civil unrest. Things haven't been peaceful there in quite some time.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. Podracing droid</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4087201-7.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">We've seen these droids plenty of times. It's a DUM-series droid. They were designed to maintain and repair podracers and other ships.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Of course, we also see the return of Peli Motto, played by Amy Sedaris.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>8. Based on the original C-3PO</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4087206-untitled-2.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The droid in this ship is an RQ protocol droid. It's purpose is to help people. The design of this character was based on the original concept for C-3PO, created by Ralph McQuarrie.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>9. Every droid in the book</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4087202-8.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Ok, so that's hyperbole, as it's not every droid. However, in this shot, we do see some B-1 series battle droids (Roger, Roger), some R2 astromech units, an RA-7 protocol droid (the one in black), a different RQ protocol droid, and a few others we couldn't place--although the bartender could be an updated EV-series supervisor droid.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>10. Death Watch</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4087203-9.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>When you see a bunch of Mandalorians in blue armor, there's a good chance you're looking at members of Death Watch. Bo-Katan Kryze was one of the lieutenants of this group, which were against the pacifists running Mandalore during a period of time. Death Watch was considered a terrorist group and wanted to take over Mandalore. At one point, they were aligned with Darth Maul. Then Death Watch became a resistance group, trying to help the people on the planet regain their freedom.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>11. Paz Vizsla</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4087204-10.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Voiced by Jon Favreau, and seen in previous seasons, Paz is a member of the Children of the Watch, Mandalorian religious zealots who were a spin-off of the Death Watch group on Mandalore</p></h3></p><br />", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-january-2023-12-new-games-available-now/1100-6510479/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "PlayStation Plus Game Catalog For January 2023: 12 New Games Available Now", "date_published": "2023-01-17 16:57:00+00:00", "description": "<p>The PlayStation Plus Game Catalog has been updated with 12 new games.

A new trailer shows off the narrative side of the game, with familiar faces from other Romance-themed games like Dynasty Warriors making an appearance.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">According to the trailer, the conflict of the game revolves around a substance called \"Elixir,\" which could be used to awaken sleeping dragons across Han-era China.

While it didn't dramatically shake up the combat, its ambitious multi-campaign structure swung for the fences. It only seemed natural that Nintendo and developer Intelligent Systems would build off Three Houses' success. While Fire Emblem Engage certainly builds on the deep and rewarding tactical combat, the predictable story and repetitive side activities feel like a step backward for the long-running series.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Fire Emblem Engage follows a more traditional structure than Three Houses\u2019 calendar-based progression. Your time is split between the tactical turn-based combat the series is known for and a hub-like area where you can interact with other characters and outfit your units with weapons and equipment. While there are multiple missions available to you at any given time, the story sticks to a linear structure as you plot a course around the map. There are no major story decisions, and apart from a couple characters found in optional paralogue chapters, everyone will recruit the same characters at the same time.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This traditional structure isn't inherently a bad thing. Some of the best games in the series follow this narrative style, and Engage's presentation and narrative are more polished thanks to its focused design. But this approach also puts the story in a brighter spotlight and, unfortunately, the extra polish doesn't hide the predictable and meandering plot, which overall falls flat.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fire-emblem-engage-review-rings-of-power/1900-6418017/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-makes-player-morale-a-game-mechanic-in-an-intriguing-way/1100-6510583/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty Makes Player Morale A Game Mechanic In An Intriguing Way", "date_published": "2023-01-17 14:00:00+00:00", "description": "<p>To an extent, all types of action games are a fight between your stubbornness to continue and the seemingly insurmountable challenge in front of you. Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty simply makes that sensation--your inherent determination to keep going--into its core mechanic using an in-game system to tie its challenge to your character's morale. It's an interesting idea, though I do worry it might lead to frustration much later into the game when the challenge of encounters likely increases.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Developer Team Ninja's upcoming action-RPG sees you play as a nameless soldier battling their way through a fantastical interpretation of the Three Kingdoms period, reimagining one of the bloodiest eras in China's history with the likes of demons and divine beasts. At the start of the game, you customize your character's appearance and decide what combat style they use. I almost went with Fire--which sees you armed with a large sword and is designed for going all-out on offense--but couldn't pass up on Water. Armed with twin shortswords and geared toward stealth? Yes, please.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Your style of combat will determine which spirit attacks you'll have access to, as well. Going with Water grants you spirit attacks that help you surprise enemies by, for instance, creating icicles that launch at an unsuspecting foe or going invisible and making it harder for enemies to notice you. Using spirit attacks depletes your spirit gauge, which can be filled by attacking enemies at close range, encouraging you to always get up in the grill of whatever you're fighting. Fights are intense and regularly over quite quickly--with no shield to speak of, your best chance of success is dodging or deflecting an enemy's strikes and then overwhelming them with melee and spirit attacks until they're stunned.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-makes-player-morale-a-game-mechanic-in-an-intriguing-way/1100-6510583/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/woo-hoo-the-simpsons-hit-and-run-soundtrack-has-appeared-on-multiple-streaming-services/1100-6510599/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Woo-hoo!
