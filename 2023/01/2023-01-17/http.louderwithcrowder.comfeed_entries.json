It's her money, and her kids need to go out and earn their own way. Osmond has been entertaining since 1973 when she was only 14, and unlike others haven't had any problems with the IRS. I'm sure it is quite a sizable chunk of change her kids aren't getting a dime of.</p><p><a href=\"https://nypost.com/2023/01/16/marie-osmond-why-im-not-giving-my-kids-any-money/\" target=\"_blank\">When you hear her explanation</a>, it makes all the sense in the world. An inheritance does nothing but breed laziness and entitlement.</p><blockquote>Honestly, why would you enable your child to not try to be something? I don\u2019t know anybody who becomes anything if they\u2019re just handed money. To me, the greatest gift you can give your child is a passion to search out who they are inside and to work.</blockquote><p>Osmond went on to say it's HER money that she worked hard for. She plans to, quote, \"spend it all and have fun with my husband.\"</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"9b2a0\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32857807&amp;width=980\" />\n</p>\n<p>It's a difficult balancing act. Parents work all their lives and want to leave their kids with something when they go. Then their kids work to make their own lives. In the case of Marie Osmond who has made so much, leaving her kids even a little something means they wouldn't have to work a day in their life.  We've seen what that breeds in children of <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/search/?q=celebrity\" target=\"_blank\">celebrities</a>.</p><p>I remember <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/conor-mcgregor-floyd-mayweather-race\" target=\"_blank\">Conor McGregor having similar concerns</a>. His kids are never going to want for anything, but he wants to make sure they know about all the hard work that went into building that when McGregor started his fighting career on welfare. Though I get the feeling when McGregor's kids are old enough and the old man starts lecturing them about work...</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"022c9\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32858054&amp;width=980\" />\n</p>\n<p>Plus, if Marie Osmond DID give her kids an inheritance, the IRS would come around and demand at least half of it. Better to just buy them real expensive gifts.</p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!

It's all part of some \"Steal a Kia\" challenge on the <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tiktok-joe-rogan\" target=\"_blank\">communist Chinese-owned social media platform TikTok</a>. The algorithm shows Chinese kids doing <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tiktok-andrew-schulz-app\" target=\"_blank\">cool engineering and science sh*t</a> in China.

And the fact that woke culture seeks to overturn that is a new form of racism that we must all oppose.</blockquote><p>This is the Don Henley moment that gets down to the heart of the matter:</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"4b898\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32856549&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><blockquote>And the only thing that wokeness has to offer in exchange is to brainwash bright, young minds like you to believe that you are victims.
