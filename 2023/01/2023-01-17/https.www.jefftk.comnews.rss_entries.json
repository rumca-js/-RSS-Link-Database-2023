The ad industry has historically thought that\nit was. For example, the <a href=\"https://iabeurope.eu/tcf-2-0/\">IAB's\nTCFv2</a>, the standard protocol consent popups use to talk to ad\nnetworks, categorizes ad fraud detection <a href=\"https://iabeurope.eu/iab-europe-transparency-consent-framework-policies/\">under\n\"Special Purpose 1\"</a>, with users having \"No right-to-object to\nprocessing under legitimate interests\". On the other hand, based on\npoints 52 and 53 of the <a href=\"https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/cnil/id/CNILTEXT000046768989\">recent\nMicrosoft ruling</a> I would predict that French regulators would rule\nthat since users do not visit sites to see ads, sites cannot claim\nthat they have a legitimate interest in using personal data to attempt\nto determine whether their ads are being viewed by real people.\n\n<p>\n\nThis is not settled; among other things the Microsoft ruling was\nprimarily considering ePrivacy which is stricter on some points. But I\nthink it's more likely than not that when we get clarity from the\nregulators it will turn out that the kind of detailed tracking of user\nbehavior necessary for effective detection of ad fraud is not\nconsidered to be within a publisher's legitimate interests.\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nThere was some informed pushback on this, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@hugo@mastodon.xyz/109652754082599760\">from\nHugo\nRoy and Michael Kleber</a>: a <a href=\"https://hroy.eu/\">privacy\nlawyer</a> and a <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@Log3overLog2@mathstodon.xyz\">privacy\nengineer</a>.  This has definitely pushed me in the direction of\nthinking I've misunderstood the situation and it's more likely that\nthe conventional ad industry interpretation is correct.  Which would\nbe a good thing in my book: as I said at the end of my post I do think\nad fraud detection should be permitted without user opt-in.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nBut I did want to write more about why I had, and to some extent still\nhold, the view I did.  As Hugo referenced, fraud detection is\nspecifically called out in the GDPR as a legitimate interest:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\nThe processing of personal data strictly necessary for the purposes of\npreventing fraud also constitutes a legitimate interest of the data\ncontroller concerned.\n<br />\n&#8212;<a href=\"https://www.privacy-regulation.eu/en/recital-47-GDPR.htm\">Recital 47</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nThe main way I could see a decision preventing the continued operation\nof economically effective ad fraud detection is that a court might\nrule that the status quo involves collecting too much. Ad fraud\ndetection looks something like collecting every signal you can and\nthen looking for patterns that distinguish people from bots.  How do\nyou know if a signal will be useful?  Start logging it and feed it\ninto the analysis.  A company might have trouble convincing a court\nthat they really need all this data, especially when there's\ncollection they can't justify in terms of current utility.  But if\nthis gets limited to where you can only collect what you can show is\nimmediately useful, and don't have a way to learn from real traffic\nwhat new signals you might want to be logging, then more and more bots\nwill get around detection.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nA secondary way I could see a decision like this happening is if a\ndata protection agency decided that, while a publisher has a\nlegitimate interest in preventing itself from being defrauded by the\nuser, it doesn't have a legitimate interest in (delegating) collecting\ndata to demonstrate that it is not defrauding its advertisers.  Yes,\nthere is a sense in which the data collection is for the purpose of\npreventing fraud, but it's essentially the publisher preventing\nthemself from committing fraud. A court could draw a distinction\nbetween intrusion into an individual user's privacy for the purpose of\ndetermining whether that individual user is defrauding the publisher,\nbut not for the purpose of determining whether there's fraud happening\nbetween the publisher and the advertiser, which the user has nothing\nto do with.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThis is speculation: can we use a prediction market to get a better\nestimate?  The one I made earlier on the <a href=\"https://manifold.markets/JeffKaufman/will-the-github-copilot-litigation\">GitHub\nCo-pilot litigation</a> seems to be going well so far, so here's <a href=\"https://manifold.markets/JeffKaufman/does-the-gdpr-ban-ad-fraud-detectio\">another\nmarket</a>:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nBefore the comments from Roy and Kleber I would have put this at ~65%;\nnow I'm at ~45%.  But if you think I'm wrong, take my (play) money!\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid02w9RNnFAv5XS1KKobdSJBpAuA46wDv9VHFwsWCyEcBFLHJrVCAncGESDgukNvkUwal\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://lesswrong.com/posts/mvFBxbhfXcdkXRNAP\">lesswrong</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/109705887759211573\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}], "source": {"url": "https://www.jefftk.com/news.rss", "title": "Jeff Kaufmann"}}
