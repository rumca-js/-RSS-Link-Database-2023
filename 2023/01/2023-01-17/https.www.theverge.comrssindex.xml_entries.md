<p id="lWacoN">The video, which Tesla CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/789019145853513729">tweeted a link to</a> saying that “Tesla drives itself,” shows a Tesla driving and parking itself, avoiding obstacles, and obeying red and green lights.

The change won’t happen automatically; it’s a manual process that can’t be reversed.

  <p id="8TUee8">Google’s Stadia Controller Bluetooth support tool is <a href="https://stadia.google.com/controller/">now live</a>, allowing all Stadia controllers to connect to PCs and other devices with Bluetooth Low Energy. Google’s tool to update Stadia controllers works over the web using Chrome, so it should work for both Windows and macOS users without the need to download an app.</p>
<p id="cRH1Dq">The tool itself will disable the proprietary Wi-Fi connectivity on the Stadia Controller and replace it with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) instead. That means if you want to use Stadia for one final time today or tomorrow, you’ll need to wait to run the update, as it’ll disable the controller’s connectivity with Google’s servers.</p>

  <p id="xVvaYP">Google is reportedly working on a location tracking tag to compete with the likes of Apple’s AirTags and Tile trackers, according to developer (and reliable leaker) Kuba Wojciechowski. Wojciechowski discovered references that indicate Google is working on support for locator tags in Fast Pair — Google’s method for quickly pairing nearby Bluetooth devices — and <a href="https://twitter.com/Za_Raczke/status/1615062461744549888">claims in a Twitter thread</a> that Google is developing its own first-party tracker to use with the feature (seen via <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/google-developing-galaxy-smarttag-competitor/"><em>Sammobile</em></a>).</p>
<p id="D2eXui">The tracker, according to Wojciechowski, is codenamed “Grogu” (the name of the baby Yoda character from the Star Wars series <em>The Mandalorian</em>) alongside the alternate names “GR10” and “Groguaudio,” and is currently being developed by the Google Nest team....</p>

These include a size of 1/1.3” and 0.6-micrometer (μm) pixels. It’s been announced just weeks before the Galaxy S23 Ultra is widely expected to be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/25/22900900/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-february-date-time-s22">unveiled on February 9th</a>.</p>
<p id="WByzSJ">Samsung has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22653558/samsung-isocell-hp1-gn5-200-megapixel-camera-sensor-announced">producing 200-megapixel sensors for years</a>, but so far it’s yet to include such a high resolution sensor on its own flagship smartphones. Last year’s Galaxy S22 Ultra, for example, included a 108-megapixel sensor for its main camera, but its new sensor almost doubles the resolution.
