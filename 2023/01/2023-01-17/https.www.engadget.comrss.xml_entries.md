<p>Microsoft could announce wide-sweeping layoffs within the next few days. The possibility of the tech giant laying off a significant part of its workforce was first reported by <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL25ld3Muc2t5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9taWNyb3NvZnQtdG8tYXhlLXRob3VzYW5kcy1vZi1qb2JzLWluLWxhdGVzdC1jdWxsLWJ5LXRlY2gtZ2lhbnQtMTI3ODg5MTYiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImIwZDRkNGYyLTViMGItNDA3Mi1iZWRiLTMxMGViOWEwMTg0NiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAa0Cw6_NBZKUuf4zI18GM8reURcDAa13CKqL8MR-6ANA&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.sky.com%2Fstory%2Fmicrosoft-to-axe-thousands-of-jobs-in-latest-cull-by-tech-giant-12788916"><em><ins>Sky News</ins></em></a> and later corroborated by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-17/microsoft-to-cut-jobs-in-engineering-divisions-this-week?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a>. <em>Sky </em>put the number of the cuts at approximately five percent of the company‚Äôs 220,000-person workforce or about 11,000 employees total. <em>Bloomberg</em> said it couldn‚Äôt find out the scale of the layoffs but reported they would affect ‚Äúa number of engineering divisions‚Äù and that they‚Äôre set to be ‚Äúsignificantly larger‚Äù than other rounds of job cuts undertaken by Microsoft over the last year.</p><p>A Microsoft spokesperson told Engadget the company does not comment on rumor and speculation. If the 11,000 figure is accurate, it would equal the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-mass-layoffs-facebook-111406126.html"><ins>11,000 jobs</ins></a> Meta eliminated last year and fall short of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-expanded-job-cuts-18000-102059372.html"><ins>18,000</ins></a> positions Amazon expects to cut once the retailer is done with its far-reaching layoffs. In any case, Microsoft seemingly finds itself on a familiar trajectory. The company saw <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-q3-2021-earnings-report-pandemic-204921611.html"><ins>profits soar</ins></a> during the first two years of the pandemic, and it tried to capitalize on the moment by going on a hiring spree, <a href="https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/microsoft-satya-nadella-remote-onboarding.html"><ins>adding 50,000 employees</ins></a> over that same time frame. But as recently as this past October, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella warned of imminent belt-tightening due to worsening macroeconomic conditions. ‚ÄúWe're focused on helping our customers do more with less, while investing in secular growth areas and managing our cost structure in a disciplined way," he told investors and analysts at the time. He‚Äôll likely have more to say about Microsoft's current position when the company <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2023/01/10/microsoft-announces-quarterly-earnings-release-date-54/"><ins>announces its second-quarter earnings on January 24th</ins></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Google has released the online tool it promised to enable Bluetooth support on the Stadia controller. This gives the cloud-streaming gamepad a second life, so owners can use it with PC, iOS or Android devices, preventing the platform‚Äôs central accessory from becoming a glorified paperweight. Stadia will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-shutting-down-stadia-162704135.html">shut its doors for good</a> on Wednesday at 11:59 PM PT.</p><p>Owners of the Stadia controller can visit this <a href="http://bit.ly/3iG0nCr">web-based tool</a> to unlock Bluetooth. The process is quick, simple and easy to follow. First, you‚Äôll need to connect your controller to your computer using a USB-C cable and ensure it‚Äôs charged to at least 10 percent. Then, you can open the tool in Chrome and follow the website‚Äôs instructions.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Google announced in September that it would shut down its cloud gaming service. It <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-stadia-refunds-explained-170036646.html">refunded</a> all game and hardware transactions starting in November, and several game studios stepped in to assist with porting progress. For example, IO interactive <a href="https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-3-stadia-carryover/">released</a> a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hitman-players-can-port-their-save-data-from-stadia-to-other-platforms-111303512.html">promised </a>Progression Carryover tool for <em>Hitman </em>players, and Ubisoft is offering <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-stadia-pc-games-free-transition-shutdown-202026044.html">free PC copies</a> of its games purchased through Stadia.</p><div id="7cd53b97746e4c5ab6ca800b59e46d32"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Stadians, you can now update your Stadia Controller‚Äôs firmware to enable Bluetooth Low Energy connections. <br /><br />Find the update tool here: <a href="https://t.co/o0iU2x0NsV">https://t.co/o0iU2x0NsV</a><a href="https://t.co/SxzUYJyRrh">pic.twitter.com/SxzUYJyRrh</a></p>‚Äî Stadia ‚òÅÔ∏èüéÆ (@GoogleStadia) <a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleStadia/status/1615411505838624773?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 17, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>I dusted off my Stadia controller to test out the tool. After half an hour of charging (it had been in a box for two years), I connected it to my MacBook, fired up Chrome and had no problems completing the process. After finishing, you can hold down the Stadia button and the ‚ÄòY‚Äô button to pair it with compatible devices.</p><p>The Bluetooth tool disables the controller‚Äôs WiFi, required for Stadia gameplay, so you may want to wait until after the closure if there's a chance you‚Äôll want to play one last time. You could even seize the opportunity to try the <em>Worm Game</em> Google released last week as a<a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-stadia-controller-bluetooth-unlock-214830717.html"> ‚Äúthanks‚Äù to its loyal users</a>.

<p>Last September <a href="https://www.engadget.com/getty-images-ai-generated-content-ban-153337930.html">Getty Images banned the inclusion of AI-generated works</a> in its commercial database over copyright concerns. On Tuesday, <a href="https://newsroom.gettyimages.com/en/getty-images/getty-images-statement">Getty Images announced</a> that it is suing Stability AI, maker of the popular AI art tool Stable Diffusion, in a London court over alleged copyright violations.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;It is Getty Images‚Äô position that Stability AI unlawfully copied and processed millions of images protected by copyright and the associated metadata owned or represented by Getty Images absent a license to benefit Stability AI‚Äôs commercial interests and to the detriment of the content creators,&quot; Getty Images <a href="https://newsroom.gettyimages.com/en/getty-images/getty-images-statement">wrote in a press statement</a> released Tuesday. &quot;Getty Images believes artificial intelligence has the potential to stimulate creative endeavors.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;Getty Images provided licenses to leading technology innovators for purposes related to training artificial intelligence systems in a manner that respects personal and intellectual property rights,&quot; the company continued. &quot;Stability AI did not seek any such license from Getty Images and instead, we believe, chose to ignore viable licensing options and long‚Äëstanding legal protections in pursuit of their stand‚Äëalone commercial interests.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>The details of the lawsuit have not been made public, though Getty Images CEO Craig Peters told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/17/23558516/ai-art-copyright-stable-diffusion-getty-images-lawsuit"><em>The Verge</em></a><em>, </em>that charges would include copyright and site TOS violations like web scraping. Furthermore, Peters explained that the company is not seeking monetary damages in this case so as much as it is hoping to establish a favorable precedent for future litigation.</p><p>Text-to-image generation tools like Stable Diffusion, Dall-E and Midjourney don't create the artwork that they produce in the same way people do ‚Äî there is no imagination from which these ideas can spring forth. Like other generative AI, these tools are trained to do what they do using massive databases of annotated images ‚Äî think, hundreds of thousands of frog pictures labelled &quot;frog&quot; used to teach a computer algorithm what a frog looks like.&nbsp;</p><p>And why go through the trouble of assembling and annotating a database of your own when there's an entire internet's worth of content there for the taking? AI firms like Clearview and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-lawsuit-data-scraping-facebook-instagram-voyager-labs-180139048.html">Voyager Labs</a> have already tried and been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uk-fines-clearview-ai-75-million-for-illegally-scraping-images-105018980.html">massively, repeatedly fined</a> for scraping image data from the public web and social media sites. An <a href="https://waxy.org/2022/08/exploring-12-million-of-the-images-used-to-train-stable-diffusions-image-generator/">independent study conducted last August</a> concluded that a notable portion of Stable Diffusion's data was likely pulled directly from the Getty Images site, in part as evidenced by the art tool's habit of recreating the Getty watermark.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

The company had already <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-valhalla-creative-director-misconduct-151932648.html">fired key managers</a> accused of misconduct, but others remained in place.</p><p>The call to action joins a growing labor movement across the gaming world.

That's on top of a gradual turn away from the long hours of crunch time that have often defined game development. Eidos' Quebec studios <a href="https://www.engadget.com/eidos-montreal-sherbrooke-4-day-work-week-184509137.html">started four-day weeks</a> in 2021, and talent has sometimes left to form independent studios where <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-co-founder-launches-game-studio-011048138.html">crunch is forbidden</a>. Simply put, employees are no longer willing to accept the status quo.</p>

If you've been curious about automated floor cleaning, but were waiting for a good deal, now might be a great time to see whether a robot vac is for you. We've tested a number of these machines over the years and this model is our current "best overall" pick in our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html">budget robot vacuum guide</a>.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>What really sets the Roomba 694 apart from other budget vacuums is the easy-to-use app. While the unit has three physical buttons that allow you to start, stop and dock the unit, you'll mostly be controlling it through the app via a WiFi connection and your smartphone. After following the setup instructions, you can  set schedules so the vac runs regularly and keeps your floors clean with minimal input on your part.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The 694 can run for 90 minutes on hard floors, but we got about half that using the vac on a mixed landscape of carpet and tile. It automatically returns to the dock when the battery runs low, so it can handle larger homes with a pit stop to recharge. We found the Roomba 694 did a good job picking up dirt and debris, but it did get tripped up if charging cables were left on the floor. Getting those out of the way and emptying the unit when it's full are two of the times you'll need to physically interact with the unit. Keep in mind that this one doesn't come with extra brushes, you'll need to order them when the time comes.&nbsp;</p><p>If you want to interact with your robot vac even less frequently, you could opt for a self-emptying model, like the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOTROWUhUTUYvcmVmPW94X3NjX2FjdF90aXRsZV8xP3NtaWQ9QVRWUERLSUtYMERFUiZwc2M9MSZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1nZC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNzg1NTUyOWYtYTllZC00YTJhLThjOTItMTZjZjkyZGI3ZGQ5In0&amp;signature=AQAAATIxw_LyQPr1Z7BOYwOV6QzmiUqIq38j0xfOtoO3hY1k&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB094NYHTMF%2Fref%3Dox_sc_act_title_1%3Fsmid%3DATVPDKIKX0DER%26psc%3D1">iRobot Roomba j7+</a>.

## 2022 saw smartphone shipments drop to 10-year lows

<p>PC makers weren't the only ones who <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pc-shipments-record-decline-221737695.html">dealt with a grim 2022</a>. Canalys <a href="https://canalys.com/newsroom/global-smartphone-market-Q4-2022">estimates</a> that smartphone shipments tanked 11 percent year-over-year, making it worst annual performance in a decade. The fourth quarter was worse ‚Äî shipments fell 17 percent compared to the end of 2021. That was also the worst fourth quarter of the past 10 years, according to analysts.</p><p>Most industry heavyweights had a tough time, too. Apple and Samsung were the only two major brands to gain market share in 2022, growing to 19 and 22 percent respectively. Chinese rivals Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo all shrank. It won't surprise you to hear that Apple overtook Samsung in the last quarter (the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-14-pro-max-review-dynamic-island-useful-always-on-display-battery-life-camera-test-sample-pictures-130020449.html">iPhone 14 family</a> was brand new, while the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s-22-review-sprucing-up-a-solid-foundation-151522033.html">Galaxy S22</a> was relatively old). However, it was still a record high ‚Äî Apple claimed 25 percent of the market in the fall where Samsung had 'just' 20 percent. Higher-end brands held steady, in other words.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You might already know why the market went south. The combination of a tough economy and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-expects-iphone-14-shipments-to-be-delayed-by-covid-restrictions-in-china-061204861.html">supply problems</a> hurt demand and created shortages. Even if you could afford your dream smartphone, you might have had a difficult time finding it. That led companies to run sales and otherwise go to great lengths to entice customers and clear out unsold stock.</p><p>Don't expect 2023 to be much better. Canalys predicts that the smartphone space might only grow slightly at best. China's re-opening is poised to help, but researchers only believe the effect will be noticeable toward the second half of the year. If that proves true, phone makers may still end up fighting for your attention with aggressive promos.</p>

## Starbucks will offer nationwide DoorDash delivery by March

<p>DoorDash and Starbucks plan to expand their delivery partnership to all 50 US states by March this year, the companies <a href="https://doordash.news/merchant/starbucks-and-doordash-set-to-expand-delivery-partnership-nationwide/"><ins>announced Tuesday</ins></a>. Following a pilot that began last year in Atlanta, Houston and Sacramento (and later expanded to Seattle, Portland and New York City), people in North California, Texas, Georgia and Florida can now turn to DoorDash when they want a Starbucks coffee delivered to them.</p><p>According to Starbucks, it will offer 95 percent of the items found on in-store menus through DoorDash. You can also customize your order just like when you order in person. The app allows you to specify whether you want syrup in your drink, your milk preference and your choice of expresso roast. DoorDash also promises prompt delivery of coffee orders but stops short of a specific guarantee. DashPass customers won‚Äôt need to pay additional delivery fees to get their pumpkin spice latte orders to their door. For everyone else, DoorDash‚Äôs standard delivery and service fees apply.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Uber Eats has offered nationwide delivery of Starbucks orders <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-22-starbucks-uber-eats.html"><ins>since 2019</ins></a>, making the timing of the DoorDash expansion somewhat puzzling. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/03/the-delivery-market-is-coming-down-from-its-pandemic-highs/"><ins>By all accounts</ins></a>, the era of massive growth delivery firms saw during the first two years of the pandemic has come to an end. Between the easing of lockdown restrictions in many jurisdictions and cost of living increases, fewer people are using delivery apps.</p>

## What happens when smart bulbs meet dumb software?

<p>The official Philips Hue app sucks.</p><p>You'd think that, being the oldest name in the smart lighting world, Philips would have the best app on the market. More than a decade of iterative improvements and a mature hardware world would see the app rise proudly above its competitors. Sadly for me, and every other Hue user, the company seems to have fallen asleep behind the wheel.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>(Yes: I know that Philips Lighting rebranded itself as Signify, but let‚Äôs not confuse matters here.)</p><p>I picked up a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-10-29-philips-hue.html">Hue starter kit</a> and some additional <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-03-28-philips-hue-app-controlled-lighting-family-add-three-new-members.html">Lux bulbs</a> back in 2013, and was very impressed with the setup for at least ten minutes. It very quickly became one of those gadgets that only really got used to show the power of your smart home to visitors. And they rather quickly tired of my ability to change my living room lights from white to purple, and back again. In fact, I mostly used the bulbs as glorified dimmer switches, which wasn‚Äôt enough to justify the high cost of the initial investment.</p><p>At some point, the app started insisting I replace the v1 (round) Bridge for the v2 (square) model. And I bristled, already feeling aggrieved that Hue was all mouth and no trousers, I resented having to pay when the existing system worked perfectly well. Especially since I <em>could</em> have used that money to buy more Hue bulbs and further lock myself into Philips‚Äô ecosystem.</p><p>No tears were shed when the Bridge eventually got smashed by one (or both) of my kids when I was out of the room. I decided, in a tiny flurry of COVID-19 lockdown-induced <em>Marie Kondo-ing</em>, that I‚Äôd toss the box into the trash and be done with it. After all, it was broken, and changing the color of my bulbs did not spark the joy I was expecting, not to mention the fact that Philips <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-tv-philips-hue-light-sync-app-signify-220026147.html">loves to charge a lot of cash</a> to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-08-31-philips-hue-entertainment-lights-movies-games-music.html">sync your lighting to a movie playing on your TV</a>.</p><p>Last month, my wife asked me why we weren't able to use Hue any more, and I explained the situation. She asked how much it would cost to fix it, and found a sealed, unused, second generation Bridge available on Facebook Marketplace for half the price at retail. So we snapped it up, obviously making the usual security checks about buying second hand IoT gear before plugging it into our network.</p><p>That was, however, when the troubles began, since you can‚Äôt just sign in to your existing Hue account, hook it up to the new Bridge, and be done. Nobody at Philips seems to have imagined that it might be worthwhile building out the ability to revive an account tied to a dead bridge. In fact, there‚Äôs no way to connect anything without a fresh login, and the bulbs themselves are tied to the old one. The app also doesn‚Äôt provide any way to hard reset a bulb, or in fact do anything beyond leave you staring at a splash screen.</p><p>For about half an hour, I did wonder if I‚Äôd just wasted some cash on a new Bridge but never to get things working again. I felt a frustration, a powerlessness, the sort that comes when you‚Äôre locked and bolted out of a building at 2am in an unfamiliar city and your phone‚Äôs out of charge. My login wouldn‚Äôt work, because my bridge wasn‚Äôt connected to the internet. A new login won‚Äôt even acknowledge the presence of the expensive hardware all over my house. My hands got very itchy.</p><p>This is the kicker: I‚Äôm not the first person to learn how bad Philips‚Äô software development is, because there‚Äôs a whole army of third-party Hue apps out there. Much in the same way that charity is an indictment on behalf of the state, the depth and breadth of Hue apps available is a massive critique on Philips‚Äô lackluster app development. You‚Äôre paid to do this, and there‚Äôs no available function in the app to be able to fix what could be a fairly common problem.</p><p>I opted to use <a href="https://huelights.com/">Hue Lights</a>, one of many independent apps that offered the ability to hard reset a bulb. All I had to do was bring each bulb close to the bridge (you‚Äôll need a lamp handy), turn it on, and hard reset each unit individually. Then I could reconnect them to the new bridge and, as if by magic, could then start using them with the official Hue app. Not that, I‚Äôll be honest, I really want to. Because this third-party, very simple app has more power than the official Philips app and it‚Äôs easier to use. If you haven‚Äôt tried it, I heartily recommend that you do. At least until Philips gets its act together.</p>

## Meta's Oversight Board calls for more inclusive rules on adult nudity

<p>Meta's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/oversight%20board/"><ins>Oversight Board</ins></a> has overruled the company's takedowns of two <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/instagram/"><ins>Instagram</ins></a> posts showing a transgender and non-binary couple with bare chests and covered nipples. One of the images was posted in 2021 and the other last year. In the captions, the couple discussed trans healthcare. The posts noted that one of them planned to undergo gender-affirming surgery to create a flatter chest and that the duo was fundraising to pay for the procedure.</p><p>However, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/meta/"><ins>Meta</ins></a> took down the posts for violating its rules on <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/sexual-solicitation/"><ins>sexual solicitation</ins></a>. The Oversight Board says that moderators reviewed the images multiple times after user reports and alerts from automated systems. The couple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-oversight-board-covid-19-misinformation-advice-132031395.html"><ins>appealed Meta's decisions</ins></a> to the company and the Oversight Board. Meta determined that removing the posts was the incorrect call and restored them, but the board looked into the dual cases all the same.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Oversight Board overruled Meta's original takedown decisions. It determined that the removal of the images was not in line with the company's &quot;community standards, values or human rights responsibilities&quot; and that the cases underline core issues with Meta's policies.</p><p>The board wrote that Meta's directives to moderators on when to remove posts under the sexual solicitation policy is &quot;far broader than the stated rationale for the policy or the publicly available guidance.&quot; It claimed the discrepancy causes confusion for moderators and users. Meta itself has noted that this approach has led to content being incorrectly removed.</p><p>In addition, the board called out the inherently restrictive binary perspective of the <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/adult-nudity-sexual-activity/">adult nudity and sexual activity community standard</a>. It notes that the rules, as things stand, generally don't allow Meta's users to post images of female nipples, though there are exceptions for things like breastfeeding and gender confirmation surgery.</p><p>&quot;Such an approach makes it unclear how the rules apply to intersex, non-binary and transgender people, and requires reviewers to make rapid and subjective assessments of sex and gender, which is not practical when moderating content at scale,&quot; the board wrote. It called the current rules &quot;confusing&quot; and noted that the extensive exceptions (which also allow for images related to protests and breast cancer awareness) &quot;often convoluted and poorly defined.&quot; As such, the board claimed, the policy is not workable in practice.</p><p>&quot;The board finds that Meta‚Äôs policies on adult nudity result in greater barriers to expression for women, trans and gender non-binary people on its platforms,&quot; <a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/1214820616135890-oversight-board-overturns-meta-s-original-decisions-in-the-gender-identity-and-nudity-cases/"><ins>an Oversight Board blog post reads</ins></a>. &quot;For example, they have a severe impact in contexts where women may traditionally go bare-chested, and people who identify as LGBTQI+ can be disproportionately affected, as these cases show. Meta‚Äôs automated systems identified the content multiple times, despite it not violating Meta‚Äôs policies. Meta should seek to develop and implement policies that address all these concerns.&quot;</p><p>The board recommended that the company modify its rules on adult nudity and sexual activity to include &quot;clear, objective, rights-respecting criteria&quot; so that everyone is &quot;treated in a manner consistent with international human rights standards, without discrimination on the basis of sex or gender.&quot; It urged Meta to review the policy to determine if it protects users against the non-consensual sharing of images and whether other rules need to be tightened on that front. Moreover, it called on Meta to align its guidance to moderators with the public rules on sexual solicitation to minimize errors in enforcing the policy.</p><p>‚ÄúWe welcome the board‚Äôs decision in this case. We had reinstated this content prior to the decision, recognizing that it should not have been taken down,&quot; a Meta spokesperson told Engadget. &quot;We are constantly evaluating our policies to help make our platforms safer for everyone. We know more can be done to support the LGBTQ+ community, and that means working with experts and LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations on a range of issues and product improvements.‚Äù</p><p>In public comments on the case (<a href="https://oversightboard.com/attachment/574162714231347/">PDF</a>), several people criticized Meta for the original decisions, claiming that there was nothing sexually explicit about the images. One user called on Meta to bring in LGBTQIA+ human rights specialists and establish policies to protect trans, non-binary and other LGBTQIA people from harassment and unfair censorship. Another called out Instagram for a double standard, accusing the platform of permitting images in which nipples are covered only by body tape while removing others where they're covered by pasties (patches that cover nipples and areolae).</p><p>One person noted that the couple &quot;have helped me accept myself and help me understand things about myself,&quot; noting that content shared on the account is &quot;very educational and useful.&quot; The comment added that &quot;there is nothing sexual about their nudity and them sharing this type of picture is not about being nude and being provocative.&quot;</p>

## Arturia turns the MiniFreak into a standalone soft synth

<p>When Arturia launched the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-minifreak-digital-synth-review-weird-161551334.html">MiniFreak</a>, it also promised that a plugin version, MiniFreak V would also be available soon. Originally it was only available to those who purchased a hardware MiniFreak, but now it's being offered to anyone who wants access to the dual digital sound engines and 22 oscillator modes without eating up any more physical space in their studio.</p><p>MiniFreak V brings all of the features of the hardware synth to your computer, save for the analog filters. Instead the V version gets modeled analog filters. Arturia has long history of delivering excellent emulations of analog hardware, so this isn't a cause for concern. The software version even has the same limitations, like six-voice polyphony. So if you've been tempted by the MiniFreak, but haven't pulled the trigger yet, this is an excellent way to take it for a test drive.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You still get a robust mod matrix, customizable LFO curves, two LFOs per voice, four lanes of modulation sequencing, a 64-step sequencer and 10 effects with three slots. It doesn't quite have the raw power of Arturia's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-pigments-4-soft-synth-vst-free-update-160036317.html">Pigments</a>, but it does have a number of features that lacks ‚Äî most notably those nearly two dozen oscillator modes.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to putting the power of the MiniFreak in your DAW, the V version can also sync with the hardware instrument. So you can control it straight from your computer.

## 'The Last of Us' is HBO's third largest debut of the streaming era

<p>If you enjoyed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-last-of-us-season-one-hbo-review-080135969.html">HBO's take on <em>The Last of Us</em></a>, you're far from alone. WarnerMedia has <a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/us/media-release/series-premiere-hbo-drama-last-us-draws-47-million-viewers-sunday-night">revealed</a> that the video game adaptation racked up 4.7 million viewers on conventional and streaming TV for its January 15th premiere, making it HBO's third largest debut of the streaming era. Only the <em>Game of Thrones</em> spinoff <em>House of the Dragon</em> rated higher with a crowd topping 9.9 million, and <em>Boardwalk Empire</em>'s 4.81 million-viewer launch from 2010 (when HBO Go arrived) was only slightly stronger.</p><p><em>The Last of Us</em> &quot;nearly doubled&quot; the audience for <em>Euphoria</em>'s season two opener, WarnerMedia says. While it's not yet clear how well the game series will fare in the long term, the company notes that Sunday night viewing for an HBO show tends to account for 20 to 40 percent of the total gross viewership per episode.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The strong initial performance isn't surprising. On top of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hbo-full-the-last-of-us-trailer-playstation-naughty-dog-163002901.html">long hype campaign</a>, <em>The Last of Us</em> has well-known names (including Pedro Pascal, Bella Ramsey and <em>Chernobyl</em> creator Craig Mazin) as well as the benefit of an established fan base from Naughty Dog's game franchise. Include HBO Max availability and a good early critical response and there were many people willing to tune in.</p><p>It's too soon to say if <em>The Last of Us</em> will be the most popular game-based TV series to date. It has to compete with successes like Netflix's League of Legends series <a href="https://www.engadget.com/riots-arcane-is-the-first-streaming-series-to-win-an-animated-emmy-award-095847137.html"><em>Arcane</em></a>, among others. However, the initial viewing data suggests this bet on a lavish production has paid off for everyone involved. In that light, it's easy to see why Sony was willing to commit to TV shows for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-horizon-god-of-war-gran-turismo-tv-shows-netflix-amazon-playstation-144132163.html">God of War and Horizon</a>. As with rival shows like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/halo-tv-review-paramount-plus-171705080.html"><em>Halo</em></a>, this is a chance to expand interest in a franchise to many more people.</p>

## What we bought: Topre‚Äôs Realforce keyboard is totally impractical, but I can‚Äôt go back

<p>There are two points I want you to take away from this article. The first: An overwhelming majority of people do not need to pay $300 for a keyboard. Easy enough. But I‚Äôm about to wax poetic about one particular $300 keyboard that has made my life better, and I don‚Äôt want it to be mistaken for a universal endorsement. There are several perfectly competent keyboards available for a tenth of this price, and many excellent models ‚Äì some would even say ‚Äúpremium‚Äù ‚Äì are available for as little as $100. You have to be a particularly warped kind of consumer, one who has invested too much time in forums populated by eternally unsatisfied keyboard enthusiasts, to take this sort of plunge.</p><p>And yet!</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>I am incredibly privileged to be able to test and write about tech products for a living, but it‚Äôs exactly those two things ‚Äì using a bunch of products, and doing a bunch of writing ‚Äì that led me to buy <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9SZWFsZm9yY2UtTGltaXRlZC1LZXlib2FyZC1GdWxsLUl2b3J5L2RwL0IwN0s5Q0g1V1M_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZnYtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImY2NDQ2NTRkLTFhNTEtNDgzOC05MGE3LTE5YzQ2MmMzOTZkYyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQNBwyZv73Ss-a-giXyqtNCDp0Mm3Y9o6FOwvoJCM1KC&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FRealforce-Limited-Keyboard-Full-Ivory%2Fdp%2FB07K9CH5WS">Topre‚Äôs Realforce R2 PFU</a> keyboard a few years back. I‚Äôve tested several keyboards for work over the years, from compact and mobile-focused options to all sorts of mechanical models. Many of these were great for the right person, but none of them totally fit my needs as someone who has to spend most of the week typing and editing. Some had keys that didn‚Äôt travel enough, some were too fast, some were too loud ‚Äì either in noise and RGB-addled design ‚Äì some felt too slick to the touch.</p><p>Taste in <em>keyboard feel</em> is fully subjective, but, as with food or art, the more you obsess over it, the more in tune with your preferences you become. Topre keyboards have had something of a cult following for a long time now, so after not <em>totally </em>meshing with the various mechanical (<a href="https://www.cherrymx.de/en">Cherry</a>, <a href="https://switchandclick.com/kailh-switches-a-comprehensive-guide/">Kailh</a>, Razer, Logitech, et al.) and non-mechanical keyboards I had used over the years, I dipped into my savings and talked myself into believing I‚Äôd be converted as well. There are <a href="https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_list&amp;c=850">various Realforce models</a> ‚Äì plus a handful of keyboards that use Topre switches but aren‚Äôt sold by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topre">Japanese firm</a> itself ‚Äì but, as someone who uses the number pad, I decided to go all the way with the <a href="https://fujitsuscannerstore.com/cg01000-290301/">full-size R2 PFU</a>.</p><p>You don‚Äôt have to know <em>how </em>a Topre keyboard works to enjoy one, but I‚Äôll try to explain. For most, mechanical keyboards sit at the top of the keyboard pleasure food chain, with membrane or <a href="https://deskthority.net/wiki/Rubber_dome">rubber dome</a> keyboards all the way at the bottom. Topre‚Äôs electrostatic capacitive switches exist <em>kind of</em> between the two, but really in their own realm off to the side. They do use <em>a </em>rubber dome, but not in the same, simple way as many cheaper/laptop keyboards. They also don‚Äôt work like mechanical switches, which slide <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-mechanical-switches-for-gaming/#section-cherry">particularly-shaped</a> pieces of plastic and metal against each other to create a distinct feel with each keypress.</p><figure><img alt="A diagram showing how Topre's electrostatic capacitive keyboard switches are designed." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/fe0a7b90-928c-11ed-b359-8fbe9a8978fe" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Topre</div></figure><p>Instead, a <a href="https://www.realforce.co.jp/en/features/">Topre switch has</a> a conical spring inside its rubber dome and a special capacitive sensor underneath the spring. At a certain point as the spring is compressed, the sensor recognizes that the switch has been actuated electrically and registers the keypress. The rubber dome component provides most of the key‚Äôs tactile feel and resistance, but there‚Äôs more going on under the hood in a Topre switch than there is in a simpler rubber dome switch, which must be physically ‚Äúbottomed out‚Äù for a keypress to register.</p><p>What does all of that actually mean? That‚Äôd be my second point: Topre switches are a joy.</p><p>Touch typing on the Realforce R2 PFU is consistently smooth and satisfying. It‚Äôs fast enough but not too fast. Each press requires just enough force and returns just enough even resistance to give my fingers a distinct, bouncy response but not fatigue them over hours of work. Fully pressing a key here has a noticeably softer ‚Äúlanding‚Äù than you‚Äôd get on a typical mechanical keyboard. (My particular model has 45g switches, but there are also options with heavier 55g switches or switches with varying weights for different keys.)</p><p>This Realforce uses Topre‚Äôs ‚Äúsilenced‚Äù switches, which aren‚Äôt dead silent, but have a <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy55b3V0dWJlLmNvbS93YXRjaD92PXc2Zmp2RldQVFVRIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmNjQ0NjU0ZC0xYTUxLTQ4MzgtOTBhNy0xOWM0NjJjMzk2ZGMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZuMuNWTb68T69wmpwH4CpkpWkcJE5q8CPD-0W3MRm9S&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dw6fjvFWPTUQ">pleasingly muffled sound</a> that doesn‚Äôt call attention to itself and is still far quieter than most mechanical keyboards. With my wife and I working out of the same one-bedroom apartment for the past three years, being able to keep the noise down has been a necessity. With this, I don‚Äôt need to sacrifice a richer typing feel in the process. That said, many Topre owners enjoy the more pronounced but still mellow <em>thock </em>sound of the non-silenced versions of these switches.</p><p>The Realforce is also just a well-made piece of hardware. The keycaps have a matte PBT finish that feels durable and avoids virtually all finger grease. The lettering is cleanly legible, and after years of use the dye has shown zero sign of smudging. The keys at the bottom of the board are gently sloped upward in a way that makes them easier to locate without looking. None of the keys feel loose, and there‚Äôs no ‚Äú<a href="https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/terms.php?t=Ping">pinging</a>‚Äù sound that you might get if you slam down on a cheaper mechanical board.</p><figure><img alt="A look at the silenced 45g switch used in Topre's Realforce R2 PFU Limited Edition keyboard." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/8533bce0-929b-11ed-a8cf-1f0caefb506d" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>The outer casing is made of plastic, but it‚Äôs thick and smooth, and it doesn‚Äôt creak as you press down. (It can flex a <em>little</em> if you go out of your way to squeeze the sides of the board, but there‚Äôs no real reason to do that in the first place.) The kickstands on the back are tightly wound in place, and the whole board has a robust sense of heft that keeps it firmly in place. Topre says each switch can survive 50 million keystrokes, which is lower than the ratings for some mechanical switches but still enough to last decades. And while the ivory-and-gray finish of my model won‚Äôt fly with everyone, I dig the more professional, ‚Äò80s IBM-style aesthetic. I don‚Äôt need showy RGB lighting to signify to myself that I enjoy video games.</p><p>On the feature side, this model can also swap between three different actuation points ‚Äì the idea being that a shorter actuation distance will result in faster key presses for tasks like gaming. I‚Äôve barely messed with that, though, as the default setting has given the right balance between speed and accuracy. All of this is still perfectly serviceable for casual gaming, and it comes with <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/-n-key-rollover-nkro-definition,5751.html">n-key rollover</a>, meaning it‚Äôll recognize any new keypress regardless of how many keys you may already be holding down at once.</p><p>There are still many reasons to not get a Topre keyboard. This particular model has nothing in the form of backlighting, for one. Its USB-A cable isn‚Äôt detachable, and it only has one kickstand setting. Realforce keyboards generally aren‚Äôt compatible with most third-party keycaps, either, so your customizations are far more limited than most mechanical keyboards. And, hello, they usually <a href="https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_list&amp;c=79&amp;sortby=price:asc&amp;show=100">cost between $220 and $300</a>. The fact that these switches are relatively complex, not in super-high demand and manufactured (and tested) by one company in Japan almost guarantees a high premium.</p><p>I also have to note that the Realforce R2 family of keyboards I‚Äôm talking about here is technically outdated, as Topre <a href="https://www.realforce.co.jp/en/products/index_master_mac.html">introduced</a> a <a href="https://www.realforce.co.jp/en/products/index_master_win.html">newer R3 series</a> several months ago. As of this writing, however, those are still not easily available in the US. For now, the R2 models carry all the same general benefits and downsides but are more readily in stock. Broadly recommended third-party models like the <a href="https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&amp;p=6182">Happy Hacking Keyboard</a> are still around as well.</p><p>Regardless, any Topre keyboard is a niche device, best suited for enthusiasts who regularly spend long stretches typing and are willing to pay a premium for it to feel consistently pleasant. For better or worse (for my bank account), that‚Äôs me. I can‚Äôt say it was the most responsible purchase, but the Realforce has made years of work a little more soothing and subtly luxurious, one keypress at a time. If you find yourself in a similarly wanting state, it‚Äôs worth finding a way to try one out.</p>

## Samsung expands self-repair program to include S22 and Galaxy Book devices

<p>Samsung expanded its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-ifixit-self-repair-program-available-launch-date-134634384.html">self-repair program</a> for Galaxy devices today, adding the latest flagship smartphones and, for the first time, PCs. As you may remember, the initiative is a team-up with iFixit, which provides tools and online self-repair guides.</p><p>Starting today, you can order repair kits for the 15-inch models of the Galaxy Book Pro and Galaxy Book Pro 360. Supported PC repairs include the display, battery, touchpad, case (front and rear), power key with fingerprint reader, and rubber foot. Additionally, Samsung added the Galaxy S22, S22+ and S22 Ultra kits. It supports repairs for the display assemblies, rear glass and charging ports for those phones.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The newly supported models join the program‚Äôs initial lineup of the Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21 and Galaxy Tab S7+. The new kits still include a free return label to help you send used parts to Samsung for recycling. All the new kits are available starting today.</p><figure><img alt="A person&#x002019;s hand holding a tool, repairing an opened-up iPhone on a blue mat." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/3923ed40-9361-11ed-a375-e2d8151b67ea" style="height: 844; width: 1500;" /><figcaption>Apple‚Äôs Self Service Repair program</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>While <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-self-service-repair-release-date-122332505.html">Apple's program</a> covers more components (including cameras and SIM trays), it also requires you to rent or buy a separate toolkit and talk with someone on the phone to complete the process. With Samsung's kit, you only need to buy the part and follow the instructions.</p><p>Samsung frames its self-repair program as being about convenience and the environment ‚Äî and it can be beneficial for both of those things. But the elephant in the room is Right to Repair legislation on federal and state levels. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-york-right-to-repair-law-kathy-hochul-184654713.html">New York</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/motor-vehicle-data-question-1-081059455.html">Massachusetts</a> have passed laws mandating self-repair programs, while the White House has also pushed for it. In 2021, President Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/07/09/executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/">ordered</a> the FTC to tackle ‚Äúunfair anti-competitive restrictions on third-party repair or self-repair of items‚Äù in the farming and technology industries. So although Samsung‚Äôs and Apple‚Äôs programs are good for consumers, it‚Äôs a stretch to think this would happen without the threat of government legislation.</p>

The rollout will begin in London this month, and will reach hubs like Amsterdam and Paris as soon as 2023. Rates and other details will be available in "due course," Uber says.</p><p>The companies first teamed up in late 2021, when Hertz pledged to offer <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-rents-tesla-evs-to-drivers-131556170.html">up to 50,000 Tesla rental EVs</a> to Uber drivers in the US. Last spring, Hertz said it would add as many as 65,000 Polestar EVs to its fleet within five years. The rental car agency claims its Uber partnership in North America has been successful ‚Äî almost 50,000 drivers have rented Tesla vehicles so far.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Both firms see the European expansion as key to furthering their goals. Uber says it plans to be a "zero-emissions platform" in London by 2025, and completely electric in Europe and North America by 2030. Hertz, meanwhile, has set out to offer "one of the largest" EV fleets worldwide.</p><p>Neither brand may have much choice, however. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-04-uk-ban-petrol-diesel-hybrid-cars-2035.html">The UK</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/eu-member-countries-agree-ban-sale-of-gas-powered-cars-2035-140035763.html">European Union</a> intend to ban sales of new fossil fuel cars by 2035, and the EU agreement also demands cutting new car emissions by 55 percent from 2030. Many automakers operating in Europe, like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-will-only-sell-electrified-vehicles-in-europe-by-2030-113015462.html">Ford</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volvo-will-go-all-electric-by-2030-and-move-all-sales-online-091653396.html">Volvo</a>, expect to drop combustion engines by 2030. Uber and Hertz will have to adopt EVs in the next several years, and these rentals could help ease the transition for drivers who can't justify buying the technology at this stage.</p>

The MacBook Pro models can now run up to 22 hours ‚Äî the longest ever on a Mac, Apple claims. And as rumored, it now supports WiFi 6E, which delivers up to twice the connection speeds of the previous generation. Another new feature is an HDMI port that supports 8K up to 60Hz for the first time and 4K displays up to 240Hz. As before, it comes with three Thunderbolt 4 ports for high-speed connection to peripherals, an SDXC card slot and MagSafe 3 charging.</p><p>They use the same Liquid Retina XDR displays as the 2021 models ‚Äî not the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-touchscreen-macbook-pro-232631704.html">rumored touchscreens</a>, which aren't expected until 2025.

<p>Sony and Canon are locked in a pitched battle for the full-frame mirrorless camera market, and Canon‚Äôs latest salvo is the $2,500 EOS R6 II. It‚Äôs not just a key rival to Sony‚Äôs like-priced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a7-iv-mirrorless-camera-review-163026066.html">33-megapixel A7 IV</a>, but gives Canon the opportunity to rectify overheating flaws in the otherwise excellent EOS R6.</p><p>The new 24-megapixel sensor promises more resolution and image quality than the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canon-r6-review-almost-perfect-140051632.html">20-megapixel R6</a>. It also offers faster shooting speeds, improved 4K video specs, an improved viewfinder and more. The competition in this category is getting tough, though. Panasonic also recently announced the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fujifilm-x-h2s-mirrorless-camera-review-123049866.html">$2,000 Lumix S5II and $2,200 S5IIX</a>, its first cameras with phase-detect hybrid autofocus.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="75d40e5f6d5c480098bf963fb678bcf9"></div><p>I saw the R6 II last last year in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canon-eos-r6-mark-ii-hands-on-040031374.html">prototype form</a>, but I‚Äôve now got my hands on the final version. Can it keep up with the competition, and are the overheating issues solved? I tried it in a variety of shooting situations to find out.</p><h3>Body and handling</h3><p>Canon has experimented with the controls of past cameras, introducing things like a touch bar, but users didn‚Äôt like it. Fortunately, the R6 II uses Canon‚Äôs tried and tested form factor, with buttons, dials and the joystick right where you‚Äôd expect to find them. The grip is big, comfortable and has a rubber-like material, giving a sure hold with no discomfort even after a day‚Äôs use.</p><p>There are a few welcome changes over the R6, though. The power switch is now at right for easier access, with a ‚Äúlock‚Äù setting that prevents accidental control activation (you can specify which controls to lock out).</p><p>Canon also introduced a dedicated photo and video switch. Flipping it changes all the settings for each button, as well as the main and quick menus. If you flip from photos to video, though, it uses whatever is set on the mode dial (M, S, A, P, etc.), so you have to remember to change that. All other settings, though, remain separate.</p><p>As before, it has a fully-articulating 1.62-million dot display that makes the R6 II useful for vlogging, selfies, etc. And Canon has updated the EVF from 2.36-million to 3.67-million dots, matching the A7 IV and getting rid of one of my biggest complaints about the original R6. It‚Äôs not quite as sharp as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fujifilm-x-h2s-mirrorless-camera-review-123049866.html">5.76-million dot EVF on the X-H2S</a>, for instance, but it‚Äôs relatively sharp and fast with a 120 fps refresh rate.</p><p>Where the R6 had a single fast UHS-II card slot and a slower UHS-I slot, the R6 II now has two UHS-II slots. Unlike the A7 IV or Panasonic GH6, though, it lacks any kind of a CFexpress card slot which does affect burst speeds and video capture options.</p><p>It uses the same LP-E6NH battery as before, but endurance is up significantly from 510 shots max on the R6 to nearly 760 on the R6 II. I‚Äôve taken well over 2,000 shots in a day (with a mix of electronic and mechanical shutter), and shot video for nearly two hours.</p><p>Naturally, it has microphone and headphone ports, along with a ‚Äúnext-generation‚Äù 21-pin digital interface at the hot shoe (Canon has shown images with the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=95276f3c-7b79-4c1e-803f-981cd9f7a968&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=B%26H+Photo+Video&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5NTI3NmYzYy03Yjc5LTRjMWUtODAzZi05ODFjZDlmN2E5NjgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmhwaG90b3ZpZGVvLmNvbS9jL3Byb2R1Y3QvMTY3OTY1MC1SRUcvdGFzY2FtX2NhX3hscjJkX2NfeGxyX21pY19hZGFwdGVyX2Zvci5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwZTJiN2I0Yy1mYTU0LTQ4ZWQtYTRhNy0yNjVmNzI2ZTU1YzUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYiakBKk3lLW6zzHHvxoDuJtisMdhkoQiuBNBc-ijPYr&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1679650-REG%2Ftascam_ca_xlr2d_c_xlr_mic_adapter_for.html">Tascam XLR2d-C</a> audio interface and its newly launched <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=95276f3c-7b79-4c1e-803f-981cd9f7a968&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=B%26H+Photo+Video&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5NTI3NmYzYy03Yjc5LTRjMWUtODAzZi05ODFjZDlmN2E5NjgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmhwaG90b3ZpZGVvLmNvbS9jL3Byb2R1Y3QvMTczMzIyNy1SRUcvY2Fub25fc3BlZWRsaXRlX2VsXzUuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMGUyYjdiNGMtZmE1NC00OGVkLWE0YTctMjY1ZjcyNmU1NWM1In0&amp;signature=AQAAAXGOPq_AKsmdK91c1Utzi7NZwOu34RdcIdk39O8NmjqM&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1733227-REG%2Fcanon_speedlite_el_5.html">Speedlite EL-5</a>). Sadly, it uses a fragile micro instead of a full HDMI port. That‚Äôs unfortunate considering the RAW video output, as micro HDMI cables (and ports) tend to be fragile and finicky.</p><p>In terms of connectivity, you can run the camera off the USB-C via the power delivery feature. It also offers Bluetooth 5 and 5GHz Wifi, and you can use it directly as a PC or Mac webcam over USB-C using the built-in industry-standard UVC and UAC video and audio drivers built into Windows and MacOS.</p><h3>Performance</h3><figure><img alt="Canon EOS R6 II mirrorless camera review" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/ecb71833-9273-11ed-bfbd-3f8418f0c259" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>As I saw in San Diego while shooting sports, the R6 II is fast. It can fire bursts at 12 fps with the mechanical shutter, which is already a touch faster than the A7 IV. However, switching to electronic mode brings that pace up to a frenzied 40 fps, making it the sportiest full-frame camera in this price category by far.</p><p>Using electronic mode means you‚Äôll shoot fewer shots though (it also impacts the quality, but more on that shortly). You can get about 75 compressed RAW/JPEG frames before the buffer fills, and fewer with uncompressed RAW. In mechanical shutter mode, by contrast, you can shoot around 1,000 compressed RAW/JPEG frames before it stops, or about 140 uncompressed RAW photos.</p><p>Speaking of the buffer, an interesting new feature is the Pro Capture mode. If you activate that setting and half press the shutter button, it will continuously record and store several seconds worth of photos in the buffer. Then, when you full-press the shutter button, you‚Äôll capture a few seconds of action that occurred right before you did so. The idea, of course, is that if you weren‚Äôt quite quick enough, you‚Äôll still get a shot.</p><p>Rolling shutter is well controlled, about half that of the original R6 and significantly less than the A7 IV, as you can see in tests performed by <a href="https://youtu.be/5bYz3nVl9l4?t=246">Gerald Undone</a>. I‚Äôd hesitate to use it for fast-moving sports at full-frame, but it‚Äôs very minimal in cropped 1.6x mode.</p><p>The Dual Pixel autofocus on the R6 II is also quicker and more reliable than the R6. Using it in single-point mode with no face/eye detection, it could keep up with the 40 fps burst speeds, missing just the odd shot. In 12 fps mechanical shutter mode, I rarely had a shot out of focus. In this aspect, it‚Äôs nearly on par with the EOS R3, which uses a stacked sensor.</p><figure><img alt="Canon EOS R6 II mirrorless camera review" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/ecb73f41-9273-11ed-affc-20830ada4590" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>There are 4,897 focus detect positions for photos and 4,067 for video, with up to 100 percent coverage depending on the lens. That means you can track subjects even at the edge of the frame. Selecting a subject is relatively easy using the multi-controller joystick or touchscreen.</p><p>On top of face and eyes, the R6 II can detect people‚Äôs bodies, plus animals and vehicles, including motorcycles, cars, trains and horses. It also comes with a new auto-select mode that lets the AI choose the subject type. It can also track user-selected subjects not in those categories.</p><p>While it can occasionally get confused by the background, the R6 II is good at locking onto human faces and eyes. It‚Äôs a bit less dependable for animals and other subjects. Tracking fast-moving subjects works well, though I had to dive into the settings to boost speeds for quicker movement. Touch to track works well if the subject is well defined, but isn‚Äôt as reliable as face tracking.</p><p>In general, autofocus is excellent and second only to Sony. As mentioned, I shot thousands of images per day at Canon‚Äôs shooting sessions (on a prototype camera), and most of them were in focus, with very little fiddling required on my part.</p><h3>Image Quality</h3><p>The new 24-megapixel sensor (neither backside illuminated nor stacked) is the biggest improvement in this camera, offering improved image quality, better low-light sensitivity and more. Images are of course sharper, but Canon has also boosted the dynamic range, allowing for improved image quality as well.</p><p>JPEGs have good levels of detail without excessive sharpening. Color accuracy is good and skin tones more pleasing than other cameras I‚Äôve tried recently. If you want to boost quality a bit but not shoot RAWs, you can also shoot using the 10-bit HEIF (high efficiency image file) format, which offers a wider color range and less likelihood of banding.</p><p>With an ISO range of 100-102400 (50 to 204800 expanded), the R6 II is actually better than the original R6 in low light, despite the extra resolution. I had no qualms about shooting at ISO 12800 using some light noise reduction, and even ISO 25,600 images were usable if I exposed correctly. Anything above that had low usability, however.</p><p>RAW images retain extra detail, especially in shadows. That makes images easier to edit should you underexpose them. It has perhaps a bit less dynamic range than Sony or Nikon full-frame cameras, but it‚Äôs still very good. Beware that dynamic range drops in electronic shutter mode, though, as the R6 II shifts from 14-bit to 12-bit capture ‚Äì so that extra speed does come at a slight loss in dynamic range.</p><section><img alt="Canon EOS R6 II sample images" class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/aa4e0402-9272-11ed-bede-a0413a4c60e0" /></section><h3>Video</h3><p>The EOS R6 II offers supersampled, full-frame 4K video all the way up to 60 fps. By contrast, the A7 IV and Panasonic‚Äôs S5 II both crop 60p video. Much like the A7 IV, 10-bit quality is available only in C-Log3 mode, with 8-bit in the regular video modes. That‚Äôs too bad, as regular 10-bit video provides extra headroom in shadows and highlights, without the hassle of applying LUTs or doing other color correction. All resolutions are available in 1.6X crop mode, with just a slight loss in sharpness.</p><p>You can do super slow mo in 1080p at up to 180fps, though the footage is barely usable. It‚Äôs more acceptable at 120fps, which still slows the action way down. And finally, you can shoot up to 6K in 12-bit ProRes RAW to an external <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAVWKuf8nqdM5MS9466YOgidAceoiAyTwP7GVE_jG7oEj&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAtomos-Ninja-Touchscreen-Recording-Monitor%2Fdp%2FB093QKY6Y9%2Fref%3Dsr_1_3%3Fcrid%3D35Q2QZV6283HH%26keywords%3Datomos%2Bninja%2Bv%252B%26qid%3D1673622479%26sprefix%3Datomos%2Bninja%2Bv%252B%252Caps%252C180%26sr%3D8-3%26ufe%3Dapp_do%253Aamzn1.fos.2b70bf2b-6730-4ccf-ab97-eb60747b8daf">Atomos Ninja V+</a> recorder. That delivers the best quality and easiest-to-edit video, if you don‚Äôt mind the hassle.</p><p>With the original R6, heating issues were a showstopper for many. You could shoot no more than 40 minutes of video at 4K 30fps, or 30 minutes at 60p. On top of that, you had to wait at least 10 minutes for it to cool down, and then you could only shoot for another 10 minutes or so.</p><p>Fortunately, those problems are largely gone. I shot supersampled 4K 30p video for nearly two hours until the battery died with no heating issues. In 60p supersampled mode, Canon says you can shoot for up to 50 minutes and get back to shooting again more quickly and for a longer time.</p><figure><img alt="Canon EOS R6 II mirrorless camera review" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/ecb71830-9273-11ed-b7f7-395f4ba7e599" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>Those numbers are actually conservative, as I was able to shoot 4K 60p for over an hour (albeit, in 50 degree F temperatures). If you start and stop 4K 60p capture, there are no problems. If you really need continuous 4K 60p video, get another camera, but otherwise overheating issues are largely gone.</p><p>Quality is excellent, with sharper video than the competition at 4K 60p. Dynamic range in CLog3 mode isn‚Äôt quite as good as Sony‚Äôs A7 IV or the Panasonic S5 II, though. Much of that is lost in shadows, so it‚Äôs better to slightly over than underexpose when shooting C-Log3. It‚Äôs nothing you‚Äôd notice for regular non-log video, though.</p><p>Low-light video is good at ISOs up to 6400 and you can get away with 12800 if you‚Äôre careful with exposure. If not, boosting shadows can create some serious noise. Still, it‚Äôs one of the better full-frame cameras in low light, making it useful for things like concerts or plays.</p><p>One unfortunate omission compared to rivals is the lack of easy-to-edit intra-frame (all-intra or ProRes) codecs. That makes it pretty much mandatory to convert to ProRes or another format afterward, as even fast editing systems don‚Äôt like LongGOP. Sony‚Äôs A7 IV, meanwhile, supports all-intra capture at up to 600 megabits per second, which is one reason it has a CFexpress Type A card slot.</p><p>Video autofocus is a strong point for Canon. With single-point autofocus for run and gun shooting, interviews and the like, I rarely had out-of-focus shots. Human face and eye-tracing is incredibly reliable for videos. It stays locked on the subject and keeps them in focus as they move, though again, Sony‚Äôs A7 IV is slightly quicker.</p><figure><img alt="Canon EOS R6 II mirrorless camera review" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/ecb71830-9273-11ed-adf7-e32ce62201ba" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>As with photos, it also offers reliable animal and vehicle tracking, with the same ‚Äúauto‚Äù mode that lets the camera‚Äôs AI choose the subject type. Overall, the R6 II is another reliable Canon camera in terms of video autofocus ‚Äì something I think is really important for most video shooters, especially vloggers or documentary filmmakers..</p><p>Canon beats all rivals in rolling shutter. It‚Äôs noticeably better than on the Sony A7 IV, even in fully-downsampled mode. In 1.6 crop mode, it‚Äôs barely detectable, even if you whip the camera around. Like bad autofocus, excessive rolling shutter can ruin shots, so for me this is another key feature.</p><p>In-body stabilization is fine for stationary handheld shots or small movements. Anything more can be jerky, even in enhanced digital IS mode, however. The R6 II is about the same as the A7 IV in this regard, but Panasonic‚Äôs new S5II has massively improved stabilization designed for video and looks like it will beat both cameras.</p><p>Finally, Canon has introduced a digital focus breathing feature, much like Sony has on the A7 IV. This allows you to ‚Äúrack‚Äù focus from one subject to another without either changing in size, by essentially using digital zoom to counteract the optical zoom.

The S5 IIx, coming in May, looks like a better mirrorless camera for video and it's less expensive at $2,200. And finally, if you‚Äôre willing to drop down to an APS-C sensor, the $2,500 X-H2S has a stacked sensor and better video chops, but slightly inferior autofocus. If you shoot both photos and video equally, I‚Äôd choose the EOS R6 II over all those models.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/willow/"><ins>Willow</ins></a>, a company that makes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/willow-launches-new-cord-free-smart-breast-pump-at-a-lower-price-123044520.html"><ins>smart breast pumps</ins></a>, is looking to make it easier for users to monitor and control their pumping sessions. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/willow-30-versus-elvie-smart-breast-pump-review-140030444.html"><ins>Willow 3.0</ins></a>, a wearable wireless pump, now has an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/apple%20watch/"><ins>Apple Watch</ins></a> companion app. As such, you won't necessarily need your phone to manage pumping sessions (though your iPhone will still need to be within 30 feet of both the pumps and your watch).</p><p>The app enables users to start and pause sessions, switch between stimulation and expression pump modes and adjust suction levels, all from their wrist. Your watch will also let you know when your last session ended, display your per-pump milk output in real-time and show the battery level of each pump.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>More than half of Willow users &quot;regularly use an Apple Watch and many want to control their pumps with their smartwatches,&quot; the company's CEO Laura Chambers said in a statement. Chambers added that Willow designed the app to give users more &quot;ease and control&quot; over pumping sessions. You'll need an Apple Watch Series 3 or above and at least watchOS 8 to use the Willow 3.0 app.</p>

## The Morning After: Wyoming wants to phase out new EV sales by 2035

<p>While other US states (and the rest of the world) inch towards goals of banning gasoline-powered cars, Wyoming is going in the opposite direction. The state‚Äôs legislature is considering a resolution that calls for a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wyoming-wants-to-phase-out-sales-of-new-e-vs-by-2035-200704042.html">phase-out of new electric vehicle sales by 2035</a>. Introduced on Friday, Senate Joint Resolution 4 has support from members of the state‚Äôs House of Representatives and Senate. The resolution says the state would need to build ‚Äúmassive amounts of new power generation‚Äù to ‚Äúsustain the misadventure of electric vehicles.‚Äù Its goal is to phase out the sales of EVs entirely by 2035. Yes, EVs.</p><p>In the proposal, a group of lawmakers led by Senator Jim Anderson says Wyoming‚Äôs ‚Äúproud and valued‚Äù oil and gas industry has created ‚Äúcountless‚Äù jobs and contributed revenue to the state. They add that a lack of charging infrastructure in Wyoming would make the widespread use of EVs ‚Äúimpracticable.‚Äù The legislation may partially be a political stunt, but Wyoming produced 85.43 million barrels of oil in 2021 ‚Äì it‚Äôs a crucial part of the state‚Äôs economy. But, Wyoming‚Äôs Carbon County also has one of the largest wind farms in the US.</p><p>‚Äì Mat Smith</p><p><em>The Morning After isn‚Äôt just a</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em> newsletter</em></a><em> ‚Äì  it‚Äôs also a daily podcast.

<p>Disney+ has released a new trailer for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-mandalorian-season-3-arrives-on-march-1st-063057873.html"><em>The Mandalorian</em></a> during the NFL Wild Card Game on ESPN and ABC Network. It shows Pedro Pascal's character Din Djarin and Grogu reunited and going on their next adventure. Din also reveals in the trailer that he's going back to the planet Mandalore in an effort to redeem himself after removing his helmet and showing his face to other people by the end of season 2. As revealed in previous episodes, Din is a member of the religious sect Children of the Watch that views removing one's helmet in the presence of others a serious transgression.</p><div id="a9ef481c000044c9989f915ab53e9677"></div><p>While Din is dealing with the consequences of his decision, the New Republic is struggling: &quot;There's something dangerous happening out there,&quot; Captain Carson Teva warned. &quot;And by the time it becomes big enough for you to act, it'll be too late.&quot; The trailer also shows Grogu exhibiting better control of the Force after leaving with Luke Skywalker in the previous season to train at his Jedi Temple.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Disney <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-mandalorian-season-three-trailer-190644043.html">released its first teaser trailer</a> for the show at last year's D23 Expo, showing us that everybody's favorite Star Wars family will indeed get reunited for season 3.

## Samsung unveils 200MP camera sensor that's likely to appear in the Galaxy S23 Ultra

<p>Samsung is continuing its &quot;more pixels is better&quot; mantra with the launch of its latest 200-megapixel (MP) sensor. The <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-introduces-the-200-megapixel-image-sensor-for-the-ultimate-high-resolution-experience-in-flagship-smartphones">ISOCELL HP2</a> is a relatively large (for a smartphone) Type 1/1.3 sensor (around 12mm diagonally) with a pixel pitch of 0.6 micrometers (Œºm) ‚Äî in between the 200-megapixel <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-isocell-hp1-200-megapixel-mobile-camera-sensor-100532406.html">HP1</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-latest-200-megapixel-smartphone-sensor-has-smaller-pixels-than-ever-082233655.html">HP3 sensors</a>. It offers more light gathering than past sensors along with new HDR features and will likely be used in Samsung's upcoming Galaxy S23 Ultra smartphone.&nbsp;</p><p>The HP2 uses something Samsung calls Dual Vertical Transfer Gate (D-VTG) technology. This essentially doubles the number of electrons available from each photo diode, &quot;boosting the pixel's full-well capacity by more than 33 percent,&quot; the company wrote. That means a pixel can hold more charge before saturating, reducing overexposure and improving color reproduction in bright light conditions.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As before, it can transform into either a 1.2Œºm 50MP or 2.4Œºm 12.5MP sensor by binding either four or 16 neighboring pixels, allowing for better performance in low light. It can shoot up to 8K 30 fps video in 50MP mode (up from 24 fps on the Galaxy S22) to minimize cropping while still allowing for sharp video. It also uses something called Smart-ISO Pro to capture 12.5MP HDR images and 4K HDR at up to 60 fps. And as before, each pixel acts as a focus agent to allow for quick autofocus, even in low-light situations.</p><p>Samsung's Galaxy S22 Ultra &quot;only&quot; had a 108MP sensor, with the 200MP HP1 chip used in other devices like the Motorola 30 Edge Ultra and Xiaomi 12T Pro. However, rumor has it that the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-plus-leaked-images-200038591.html">S23 Ultra will have a 200MP sensor</a>, and the HP2 fits the bill as it's already in mass production, Samsung said. The Galaxy S23 is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-unpacked-2023-galaxy-s23-event-230050182.html">set to be revealed</a> in just two weeks on February 1st, 2023.&nbsp;</p>

Microsoft says it's also adding access to ChatGPT, which it describes as a "fine-tuned version of GPT-3.5," to the service "soon."</p><div id="07873df2083441649671378840d74c8b"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">ChatGPT is coming soon to the Azure OpenAI Service, which is now generally available, as we help customers apply the world‚Äôs most advanced AI models to their own business imperatives. <a href="https://t.co/kQwydRWWnZ">https://t.co/kQwydRWWnZ</a></p>‚Äî Satya Nadella (@satyanadella) <a href="https://twitter.com/satyanadella/status/1615156218838003712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 17, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>The tech giant has been associated with OpenAI ever since it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-22-microsoft-invests-openai-azure-supercomputing.html">invested $1 billion</a> in the Elon Musk-founded startup back in 2019. This announcement comes shortly after reports were published that Microsoft is in talks to invest an additional $10 billion in the company. "These [AI] models are going to change the way that people interact with computers," Microsoft's head of AI platforms Eric Boyd previously told <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a6d71785-b994-48d8-8af2-a07d24f661c5"><em>The Financial Times</em></a> in an interview.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While OpenAI has been around for a while, it was recently thrust into the spotlight following ChatGPT's debut. The program has the ability to return long, coherent answers that aren't immediately recognizable as machine-generated responses. It was good enough to alarm educators, who expressed concerns that it could be used for cheating. Earlier this month, New York City public schools <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-openai-new-york-city-public-schools-ban-192608080.html">banned</a> ChatGPT from school devices and WiFi networks.</p><p><em>The Information</em> also previously reported that Microsoft was planning to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-reportedly-integrating-chatgpt-technology-into-bing-131502579.html">integrate the OpenAI software</a> powering ChatGPT into Bing. While it's still unclear what the software could do for the search engine, sources said it could enable Bing to return results in a format that's friendlier and easier to digest. ChatGPT is available for free at the moment, but OpenAI intends to make money off it in the future and has already <a href="https://www.engadget.com/openai-chatgpt-professional-paid-chatbot-143004442.html">opened a waitlist</a> for those interested in testing a paid version of the bot.</p>
