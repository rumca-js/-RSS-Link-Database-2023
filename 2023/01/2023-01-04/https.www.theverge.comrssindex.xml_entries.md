  <p id="GpplWB">TCL’s displays are in TVs, smartphones, and maybe in the near future, the metaverse, too. At least, the company wants to make the screen that gets you there. At CES 2023, the company is announcing its latest experiments with wearable displays, including a VR headset and mixed reality glasses. Plus, its personal display glasses, which have only been available in limited markets, are now heading for the US. It’s kind of a “cover-all-your-bases” strategy for whatever the future of display technology looks like.</p>
<p id="k0Owuj">The company’s NXTWear S glasses are the latest version of its wearable display — kind of like a TV contained in a pair of (sort of) ordinary-looking glasses. They aren’t AR or VR glasses; they plug into a device like your phone or...</p>

## TCL’s 2023 TVs have new branding and are gaming powerhouses

  <p id="obFman">TCL is overhauling its TV strategy for 2023 by ditching the company’s long-running 6-Series, 5-Series, and 4-Series branding in favor of two new lines: higher-end sets will be part of the Q-Series, while more value-focused TVs will fall under the S-Series. Within the two segments are six different models in all. </p>
<p id="WBHvvX">Let’s cover the best first, shall we? With its flagship QM8, TCL is promising double the peak brightness of its best Mini LED TVs from 2022 — and those were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22914122/tcl-6-series-google-tv-r646-review-mini-led">already fairly impressive in their own right</a>. Set to come in screen sizes between 65 inches and 98 inches, the largest QN8 packs in more than 2,300 dimming zones.

  <p id="vpOgKj">From the beginning, the Asus Zenbook was an attempt to beat Apple’s MacBooks at their own game — using knowledge Asus originally obtained while helping to build those laptops for Apple. Why do I bring that up? We’re wondering whether the new Asus ZenBook Pro 14 and 16X might give them a run for their money. </p>

  <p id="x5naEd">For some companies that sell gaming and creator-oriented laptops, glasses-free 3D has become a bit of a dream. Acer first tried it back in 2021. Its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22451850/acer-spatiallabs-3d-content-rendering-conceptd-7-pro">SpatialLabs technology</a>, which uses a combination of a stereo camera, optical lens, and real-time rendering technology to create decently realistic 3D images, has since made its way to a number of laptops, including the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/18/23093024/acer-predator-helios-300-glasses-free-3d-content-triton-se">Predator Helios 300</a> gaming rig.</p>
<p id="VtvDCr">This year, it’s Asus’ turn. The company has announced Spatial Vision, a “glasses-free (autostereoscopic) 3D OLED technology.” The screens are 3D, 3.2K, OLED, and 120Hz. In a similar manner to Acer’s tech, machines that support Spatial Vision will use a combination of a lenticular lens and advanced eye-tracking camera technology. They render...</p>

  <p id="f9YHSg">Asus has announced upgrades to its four TUF Gaming models: the F15, F17, A15, and A17. The devices have new processors and GPUs inside, but what’s especially good to see is that all four models now have a dedicated MUX switch supporting Nvidia’s Advanced Optimus technology.</p>
<p id="Kyuqs6">Previously, these models have included an MUX switch, which allows users to disable their integrated graphics, but not Nvidia’s feature for automatically turning it on and off. When the switch is on, instead of needing to route frames that a discrete GPU generates through its integrated GPU, a laptop will send them directly from the dGPU to its screen (as a desktop PC does). This will meaningfully impact battery power, so you wouldn’t want to do it if you’re out and...</p>

  <p id="fmx4gN">If you want a hockey puck of a computer to easily deploy on a desk or behind a monitor, you’ll find <em>plenty </em>on sale, from the Mac Mini to Intel’s bare-bones NUC. But Asus is adding a “why didn’t anyone think of that?” feature to its new Chromebox 5 this year: a built-in 15W wireless charger for your phone and / or earbud case.</p>
<p id="vuSZay">Okay, technically, someone <em>did</em> think of that before: <a href="https://techsterweb.com/2016/09/26/qi-lid/">you could buy an aftermarket wireless charging “lid” for some Intel NUCs</a>, and Intel even added the feature itself to <a href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/209692/intel-nuc-11-performance-mini-pc-nuc11paqi50wa.html">a few NUC</a>s.

But the laptop’s lightness doesn’t mean it’s super thin — it’s 0.67 inches thick, likely to fit all the ports on the sides of the device.

<p id="ge4nZI">But this year, MSI has decided to throw its hat in the ring. It’s just announced the new Stealth 14 Studio, which it’s boldly claiming is “the most powerful 14-inch gaming laptop.” That is a tough title to live up to, considering that the G14... exists (not to mention Razer’s Blade 14, which is also a strong, and sometimes even stronger, performer).</p>

  <p id="GW1oIj">There’s something wrong with the seemingly hundreds of laptops that have been birthed so far during CES 2023: almost none of them are translucent. Using a see-through design is proven [no citations found] to make more people want to buy a product because, for one, it looks cool, and two, the company must be pretty confident in its engineering handiwork to want to show it off like that.</p>
<p id="y6AiBR">The thing is, if a company uses translucent plastic on your gadget, it’s got to go for it 100 percent or go home. And that’s where MSI goes wrong.</p>

<p id="nfDutg">Citing “a further deterioration in economic conditions,” Sud told Vimeo staff that nearly every department and region of the company will see cuts. The majority of layoffs will occur in large departments like sales and research and development.</p>
<p id="gn0OrL">“We are entering 2023 with a more focused strategy to simplify Vimeo, and ultimately, our team size and composition needs to reflect that focus,” Sud wrote. “This reduction enables us to achieve our growth and profitability goals in a way that is far less dependent on the broader market, putting us in full control of our destiny.”</p>

  <p id="vDit4t">Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC) has fined Meta over its handling of user data, following hundreds of millions of dollars in similar fines and potentially putting parts of its ad business at risk. The DPC announced today that Meta must pay €210 million (around $222 million) for violating European Union privacy rules with Facebook’s practices, plus €180 million (around $191 million) over similar violations with Instagram.</p>
<p id="B7hST0">The fines stem from two 2018 complaints about how Meta — formerly Facebook — complied with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which went into effect that year.

  <p id="JIm2jh">Panasonic’s new cameras are finally making the leap to a new autofocus system, potentially putting them in line with the latest offerings from Sony, Canon, and Nikon. At CES, the company is announcing the Lumix S5II and its stealthy, blacked-out cousin, the S5IIx — a duo of 24-megapixel full-frame mirrorless hybrid cameras for both stills and video, due out in January for $1,999 and May for $2,199, respectively. Also announced alongside them is a $799 14-28mm f/4-5.6 S Macro lens, arriving in February.</p>
<p id="yckMgM">Unsurprisingly for Panasonic cameras, the S5II pair have a lot of video features, like 6K recording with real-time LUTs. This year, they ditch the dated and clunky contrast-detect autofocus for a new hybrid phase-detect system Panasonic...</p>

  <p id="Nk5Gyx">Samsung is starting off 2023 with a budget phone refresh, making some smart upgrades with the Galaxy A14 5G — at least on paper. The A14 will cost $199, which is $50 lower than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22810665/samsung-galaxy-a13-5g-a03s-android">the A13 5G’s list price</a>. Compared to its predecessor, it comes with a higher-res display and selfie cam while leaving many other core specs alone. Samsung will also offer up to four years of security updates and two OS version upgrades, which is a significant step up from the two or three years of security updates that are much more common at this price.</p>
<p id="eBayj3">The A14 5G has a MediaTek 700 chipset and 4GB of RAM, just like the A13. That’s fine — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22907086/samsung-galaxy-a13-5g-review-price-screen-specs">the A13 delivered good performance</a> with that combination, so Samsung isn’t trying to fix something that wasn’t broken.

  <p id="igQfvp">As 2023 begins, open up the most-downloaded charts for free apps on iOS and Google and you’ll find TikTok where it usually is: on top. The video-centric social app currently ranks No. 3 overall in both stores, trailing only a shopping app and mood diary (on Android) and a to-do app and video editor (on iOS). That video editing app is CapCut, by the way, and it is also developed by ByteDance; CapCut is an app for making TikTok videos.</p>
<p id="ukuXkm">Downloads are a crude metric for capturing an app’s cultural impact, but there’s no doubt that TikTok has retained its dominant position among social apps as the year begins. It’s the place where new trends are born, pop stars are minted, and young people spend a staggering share of their time.</p>

<p id="pFtYrv">While brushes may not sound as impressive as lidar mapping, AI-obstacle avoidance, or automatic emptying docks, a big problem with most robot vacuums is they have one small brush trying to pick up all the dirt.

<p id="OU1VeH">In my experience testing robot vacuums, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22997597/best-robot-vacuum-cleaner">Roomba’s superior cleaning power</a> is largely down to its dual rubber roller brush system that rotates in opposite directions to get up more grime and is less...</p>

  <p id="y4ICGr">HP has joined the list of companies making wireless earbuds and then sticking a screen on the charging case, with its announcement of the Voyager Free 60 Plus. Oddly, the company’s marketing the earbuds directly toward enterprise users rather than gadget heads, but we’ll get back to that in a bit. Let’s talk about that screen first.</p>
<p id="jvBfZz">It’s actually optional — the regular Voyager Free 60s come with a plain old charging case, which HP says will add 10 hours of talk time. The case for the Plus model, however, has an OLED touchscreen that lets you control music playback, volume, and settings, see your battery status, and accept or reject calls. </p>

  <p id="8YEhEI">For years, the HP Elite Dragonfly has been one of the most sleek, luxurious, and exorbitantly expensive business laptops you can buy. The new Dragonfly Pro is HP’s attempt to market those models to a broader, consumer-focused, and more price-conscious audience. There’s a Windows-based Dragonfly Pro, and there’s a Dragonfly Pro Chromebook, and while we don’t know the pricing yet, the hope is that they will be cheaper than their business counterparts.</p>
<p id="SPI8Cs">I spent a few minutes with the Dragonfly Pro Chromebook and the Dragonfly Pro, and they seem nice. They’re well-built and pretty-looking (and I’d be shocked if they weren’t, coming from HP). They come in black and white options. But the first thing you’ll probably notice is that the...</p>

  <p id="kMWIF1"><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/4/23009841/samsung-qd-oled-tv-s95b-preview">Last year’s S95B QD-OLED (quantum dot) TVs from Samsung</a> were an exciting shakeup for the consumer market and gave LG and Sony some long overdue competition. But the S95B series was limited to just 55-inch and 65-inch models — because those are the only TV sizes that Samsung Display manufactured QD-OLED panels for. It’s brand new technology, after all.</p>
<p id="nk8Bu7">But only a year later, we’re going bigger. Samsung’s just-announced S95C QD-OLED TV will add a larger 77-inch model in addition to the previous sizes. Every TV maker claims that consumers are increasingly opting for larger and larger sets, so this was the obvious thing to do as Samsung builds out its OLED reputation.</p>
<p id="RFkQo8">The <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/samsung-s95b-oled-tv-review-qn65s95b/">S95B was a superb TV</a>, and the QD-OLED panel marked a legitimate...</p>

  <p id="KAowWQ">Last year, Samsung radically shook up the TV market with the introduction of its first OLED model in many years. And it used a new QD-OLED (quantum dot) panel that produces superior color brightness compared to popular OLED sets from LG. </p>
<p id="ZqSH3U">2023 is going to be decidedly low key by comparison. Instead of introducing yet another flashy new TV to its portfolio, Samsung is focused on improving everything down the line. And most of the refinements in this year’s Neo QLED (Mini LED in Samsung parlance), QLED (standard LCD sets), and OLED TVs are centered around AI and enhanced picture processing. Things like a greater, more three-dimensional sense of depth, improved upscaling, and more. The hardware features you’d expect on premium models,...</p>

## Qi2: How Apple might finally harness MagSafe by giving it away

  <p id="4NNMXk">It’s safe to say that Apple’s MagSafe magnetic charging pucks for iPhone have not created the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/10/14/21515490/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-accessories-ecosystem">amazing snap-on accessory ecosystem we’d hoped</a>. Instead of freely allowing manufacturers to create gadgets that power and/or communicate with an iPhone, the company chose its traditional <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22690338/apple-iphone-lightning-ports-convenience-control-usb-c-eu-wireless-charging-mfi-magsafe">tight licensing stranglehold</a>. But this time, manufacturers realized they didn’t need to play Apple’s game, because the two main components of MagSafe — a Qi wireless charging coil and an array of magnets — were freely available. The result: a wide array of “MagSafe-compatible” accessories of varying quality.</p>
<p id="ngq2JZ">But now, Apple’s trying something different. With the blessing of competitors, Apple is about to change the Qi wireless standard <em>itself. </em>It’s contributing...</p>

## Samsung’s recall fix for overheating washers is a software update — and a dongle

  <p id="ATyuYd">As companies have announced smart appliance after smart appliance, some people (myself included) have questioned why on earth you’d want to connect something like a washing machine or refrigerator to the internet. Samsung, however, has come up with a very compelling, if admittedly niche, use case: the company <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/important-software-repair-announcement-for-recall-of-certain-samsung-top-load-washers/">announced in December</a> that it's issuing an over-the-air software patch as part of the recall for some top-load washing machines that “can short-circuit and overheat, posing a fire hazard.” </p>
<p id="lzqnpv">It’ll even send some customers a dongle in case their washers can’t connect to Wi-Fi.</p>

  <p id="cUwaXW">L’Oréal is no slouch when it comes to gadgets. Like Dyson, L’Oréal has been pushing the game in beauty tech for the past few years, announcing neat gizmos like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/14/18094903/loreal-uva-track-la-roche-posay-my-skin-uv-sensor-wearable-exposure-sun-uvb">wearable UV</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/6/18168205/loreal-my-skin-track-ph-sensor-measure-wearable-skincare-ces-2019">pH sensors</a>. This year is no different. For CES 2023, the company is announcing two makeup gadgets: Brow Magic, which uses AR to create and draw your perfect brow, and HAPTA, an accessible lipstick applicator prototype.</p>
<p id="WnOHY5">Brow Magic was developed with <a href="https://www.prinker.us/">Prinker</a>, which makes a temporary tattoo printer. Brow Magic works similarly. It’s got 2,400 tiny nozzles that can print up to 1,200 dots per inch. And when you think about it as a tattoo printer, it makes sense given popular brow procedures like <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/all-about-eyebrow-microshading">microblading and microshading</a> are also semipermanent tattoos.

  <p id="qfPtSp">Withings is generally known for its sleek smartwatches, but it also shows up at CES each year with ambitious health gadgets. Last year, it was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22855714/withings-body-scan-ekg-body-fat-fda-ces-2022">a smart scale</a> that could also take EKGs and segmented body composition readings. This year, it’s the U-Scan, an at-home, hands-free “urine lab” that you stick in your toilet. </p>
<p id="VyjMiR">Yes, you read that correctly.</p>
<p id="eVMnFw">The U-Scan consists of two parts: a reader and a replaceable cartridge. The reader itself is the part you pee on, while the cartridge is inside. It has a thermal sensor to differentiate between pee and toilet water as well as low-energy radars to detect <em>who</em> is urinating by identifying the movement and distance of your individual urine stream. In other words, the U-Scan only works with one person...</p>
