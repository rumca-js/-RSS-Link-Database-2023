Hello and welcome to TUESDAY NEWSDAY! Your number one resource for the entire weeks worth of VR news! This week we have a ton of pretty exciting pre- CES VR news from HTC Vive to new electrostiimulation gloves... just in general this is about to be a crazy week for the entire AR and VR industry.. But one of the most exciting things I caught wind of has to be either the fact that Meta is going to be focusing much harder on PCVR in the future as well as Quest 2 and standalone; but ALSO, some really interesting electrostimulation hydro gels that are in research. 

Sorry for the different mic this this video, I made it on the road!!
