<p>The Irish Data Protection Commission announced Wednesday that it would fine Meta Ireland a total of $413 million for breaches of the EU’s <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3202771/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-requirements-deadlines-and-facts.html">GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)</a> related to the company’s handling of personal information on Facebook and Instagram.</p><p>Under the GDPR, companies looking to process users’ personal information must do so under one of six identified legal bases, which include the consent of the user, necessity to the performance of a contract, and necessity to comply with a legal obligation. Meta, in response to the original user complaints filed under the GPDR in 2018, stated that it would rely on the “contract” justification, rather than the “consent” prong, as it had previously done. (The complaints argued that, by requiring users to agree to Meta’s use of personal information for ad targeting purposes, the company wasn’t offering users any real choice in the matter.)</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3684514/meta-hit-with-413-million-fine-in-eu-for-breaking-gdpr-rules.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>Apple is serious about sustainability, which is important if you want billions of smartphone users to move to wireless charging. That likely explains why it has put its MagSafe tech forward as a standard for use by others via the <a href="https://www.wirelesspowerconsortium.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Wireless Power Consortium</a> (WPC).</p><h2><strong>Apple’s MagSafe is all aboard the Qi2</strong></h2>
