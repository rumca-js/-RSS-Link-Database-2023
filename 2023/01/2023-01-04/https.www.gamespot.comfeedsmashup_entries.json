New GeForce 40 series laptops are up to three times more efficient than the previous set of laptops. The energy efficiency is in part because of how they ship with the lowest voltage GDDR6 memory yet and how the tri-speed memory control lets the GPU switch to lower-power memory states automatically.</p><p>With Ada Lovelace architecture, Nvidia DLSS 3, and fifth-generation Max-Q tech, 40 series laptops can provide four times faster performance.

With the release of Overwatch 2, Blizzard introduced a ton of changes to the competitive mode in an attempt to reduce toxicity in the community, and for the first season, it felt like the changes worked without causing too many problems. However, Season 2 of Overwatch 2 has shown cracks in the new systems, resulting in messy and lopsided matches.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">The current state of Overwatch 2 competitive</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">The main issue with Overwatch 2 competitive matchmaking is that players are consistently getting matched with and against players far outside of their skill range.

It can be hard for players to identify when this happens, since Blizzard stopped displaying player ranks in match with Overwatch 2 and players' career profiles are set to private by default. When matchmaking works correctly, this is fine, but when players are matched against players out of their skill range, it results in more toxicity in chat with players frustrated during their matches.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-competitive-matchmaking-is-a-mess-right-now/1100-6510298/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-2-and-modern-warfare-2-season-2-start-times-and-details/1100-6510296/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "CoD: Warzone 2 And Modern Warfare 2 Season 2 Start Times And Details", "date_published": "2023-01-04 18:18:00+00:00", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">A new season of Call of Duty is just around the corner, and the Season 2 update should bring more weapons, operators, and a new battle pass to both <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii/\">Modern Warfare 2</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20/\">Warzone 2</a>.

A renegade with a microchip on his shoulder, Silverhand stands at around 12 inches tall, has plenty of articulation, and comes with several accessories.</p><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://www.sideshow.com/collectibles/cyberpunk-2077-johnny-silverhand-sixth-scale-figure-hot-toys-907403\">See at Sideshow Collectibles</a> </div><p>Basically, if you ever wanted to own an older version of Ted \"Theodore\" Logan who happens to be grumpier, more lethal, and regularly cracks out <em>much better </em>hit singles, this could be the perfect figure for you.</p><p>Provided that you have $285--plus shipping--to spend on this collectible, that is. Is this an eye-watering sum for a highly detailed toy? Absolutely. Do I regret that I have to consume the cardboard that this figure arrived in because I deemed it to be more important than eating proper food for the next month? Not a chance.</p><p>Silverhand's appearance is dead-accurate to his video game version, you can swap out his bulletproof vest for a more laid-back band T-shirt, and you can strike several great poses with him. It's not an entirely perfect figure, with some elements that maybe feel a bit dated (explained below) when compared to more recent offerings from Hot Toys, but it's still a collectible that stands out on any shelf.</p><p>If you're interested in getting your silver hands on it, Sideshow Collectibles is still taking preorders for its upcoming full release.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4082635-silverhandht%2827%29.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Like every Hot Toys figure, there's a <em>lot </em>of extra plastic and padding to keep the figure secure during transit. You might want to have a small set of scissors on standby so that you can get all of that protective film off of Silverhand.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4082669-silverhand-2.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>You're mine now, Keanu. Forever and ever. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4082637-silverhandht%281%29.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>A weapon that John Wick himself would covet, Silverhand's Malorian Arms 3516 is a beast of a hand cannon that packs a heck of a punch inside of the game. It's worth grabbing in Cyberpunk 2077, as assembling Silverhand's signature look for V makes for a fun quest.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4082638-silverhandht%2824%29.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>While Johnny's vest doesn't look bad, it does suffer from a common problem with sixth-scale figures in that it has a slightly puffy look to it. The materials used also aren't entirely accurate to what is seen in Cyberpunk 2077--where it has a smoother finish and less obvious stitching--but you can remove it easily enough and display it with the rest of Johnny's accessories. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4082640-silverhandht%2825%29.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Just remember, that in the dark future of Cyberpunk 2077, to always have your band branding on everything you own. Even your protective clothing that you don just before you embark on a quest to burn a city to the ground.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4082639-silverhandht%2822%29.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>While the vest might be disappointing, Johnny's iconic prosthetic certainly isn't. It's not made from diecast materials, but the cybernetic limb sports a shiny finish, some battle damage, and plenty of small details. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4082641-silverhandht%285%29.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>What's a rock star without some trendy shades? Johnny's sunglasses can easily be placed on his head and will remain secure, and if you feel like recreating the iconic E3 2019 Cyberpunk 2077 trailer, there's even a hand that you can swap in that can hold his sunglasses. Just remember it's his cybernetic hand, not his regular human one.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4082642-silverhandht%286%29.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Want to take Johnny's vest off? That's easy enough. Just rip his head off, undo the velcro on the left side, and you're good to go. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4082643-silverhandht%289%29.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>And there you go, Johnny Silverhand in the rebel rocker flesh. The Samurai vest has a great print on it, and helps cover up most of the visible toy joints.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4082644-silverhandht%2821%29.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>You don't need too many accessories for your Johnny Silverhand, but Hot Toys has definitely included the <em>right </em>extras for this figure. Out of the box you'll get his signature gun, a bottle of liquor that is surprisingly still full, a wristband, sunglasses, Silverhand's dog tags, and a duffel bag that has several Samurai band patches on it. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4082645-silverhandht%2815%29.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>As for the guitar? It has actual strings, a sleek finish, and some amazing little details hidden on it. Just don't expect to start strumming a few bars from Samurai's Chippin' In hit single unless you have really tiny fingers. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4082665-silverhandht%2819%29.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>There's no shortage of hands to swap in and out for Johnny, and his display base looks great as well. It's your typical Hot Toys octagon base with a crotch-grabber stand to keep the figure secure, but it also has some delightful translucent effects around the base. According to rare console-collecting rules, this means that this base is automatically the <em>best </em>base.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4082646-silverhandht%2814%29.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Without the bulky vest on, Silverhand looks brilliant in his favorite band clothing. The figure has an impressive physique, and you're able to get a better look at the cybernetics implanted into the body of this renegade. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4082647-silverhandht%2812%29.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>For the arms, there's a decent amount of articulation, but nothing radical here. Hot Toys has experimented with figures that have a silicone layer on top of their frames, creating a more realistic appearance, although that approach does have its own drawbacks in terms of durability. More traditional plastic doesn't have that problem and you can leave the limbs in a dynamic pose without worrying about wear and tear, although you will notice the more visible joints. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4082648-silverhandht%284%29.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Likewise, with the pants, you'll want to make certain that your Silverhand is in an area where humidity isn't a problem. The synthetic leather that Hot Toys uses is great, but stressing out the fabric with exaggerated poses and warm climates can lead to it flaking over time.  </p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4082649-silverhandht%282%29.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>It's worth noting that Silverhand can do something that many Hot Toys figures are incapable of, and that's strike a sitting-down pose.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4082650-silverhandht%2810%29.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>And remember, stay excellent. </p></h3></p><br />", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/chris-evans-chris-pratt-more-show-support-for-jeremy-renner-after-accident/1100-6510297/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Chris Evans, Chris Pratt, More Show Support For Jeremy Renner After Accident", "date_published": "2023-01-04 18:04:00+00:00", "description": "<p>Days after Jeremy Renner's <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jeremy-renner-shares-photo-revealing-his-injuries-after-major-snowplowing-accident/1100-6510233/\">snow plowing accident</a>, in which the Oscar-nominated actor suffered severe trauma, his Marvel family and peers reached out to the star and lent their support and encouragement.

Fan developer Jonasz Osmenda apparently had the same idea, as they're working on a first-person remake of <a href=\"https://jonasz-o.itch.io/fallout2remake3d\">Fallout 2</a> that you can play for free right now.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Osmenda's project is a very faithful rendering of the game, taking the maps and enemies from the original and translating them into a classic FPS perspective. The result looks a lot like the early days of the FPS genre, with two-dimensional models walking through basic 3D maps \u00e0 la Doom. Unlike Doom, however, the game has the turn-based VATS system, and it's more of an RPG than a pure shooter, complete with hit points and action points.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Given that this is version 0.0.23 of the project, it's fair to say that this Fallout 2 FPS remake is in early days still. However, it's under active development, with four updates coming in the past month, and more maps likely on the way. Currently, you can explore Klamath and Arroyo, among others.
