It is a scary truth, one that each player faces before, during and after their career, yet we still pursue this dream to its sometimes bitter end. </p><p><em>RK Russell played three NFL seasons for the Dallas Cowboys and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</em></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/04/damar-hamlin-brotherhood-ryan-russell-essay\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jan/04/meta-dealt-blow-eu-ruling-data-opt-in-facebook-instagram-ads", "title": "Meta dealt blow by EU ruling that could result in data use \u2018opt-in\u2019", "date_published": "2023-01-04 16:38:54+00:00", "description": "<p>Irish regulator fines Facebook owner \u20ac390m after EU rejects argument for use of data to drive personalised ads</p><p>Meta has had a blow dealt to its business model by an EU decision that could force the Instagram and Facebook owner to ask users to \u201copt-in\u201d to having their data used for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/26/meta-earnings-report-facebook-stocks\">personalised ads</a>.</p><p>Ireland\u2019s Data Protection Commission (DPC) has fined <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/meta\">Meta</a> a total of \u20ac390m (\u00a3343m), after the EU\u2019s data authority rejected the company\u2019s argument that users agree to receive ads based on their personal data when they enter into a \u201ccontract\u201d with its social media platforms via the terms and conditions they sign.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jan/04/meta-dealt-blow-eu-ruling-data-opt-in-facebook-instagram-ads\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jan/04/stephen-colbert-late-night-recap-congress-mccarthy-speaker-votes", "title": "Colbert on speaker votes: \u2018Pure uncut Peruvian blue flake Schadenfreude\u2019", "date_published": "2023-01-04 16:36:32+00:00", "description": "<p>Late-night hosts discuss Kevin McCarthy\u2019s historic failure to be elected speaker of the House and George Santos\u2019s lies</p><p>Stephen Colbert\u2019s first monologue of 2023 coincided with the first day of the new Congress, in which Republicans took over the House and Kevin McCarthy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/03/kevin-mccarthy-house-speaker-vote-republicans\">tried and failed three times</a> to become its speaker. \u201cIt has been a day of pure uncut Peruvian blue flake Schadenfreude, watching the GOP stab each other in the throat,\u201d the Late Show host said. \u201cAnd tonight, I\u2019ll peel back the many layers of the stupidity\u201d in a segment titled \u201cAss Onion: A Kev\u2019s Out Mystery.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jan/04/stephen-colbert-late-night-recap-congress-mccarthy-speaker-votes\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/04/alan-rankine-the-associates-architect-of-indie", "title": "Alan Rankine was the maestro of the Associates\u2019 post-punk pop \u2013 and an architect of indie", "date_published": "2023-01-04 16:35:52+00:00", "description": "<p>As the multi-instrumentalist musical force behind the Scottish art-pop band, and later as a producer and label boss, Rankine was an adventurous, experimental, inspirational figure<br />\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/03/alan-rankine-of-the-associates-dies-aged-64\">Alan Rankine of the Associates dies aged 64</a></p><p>It starts with a constellation of synthesiser drones and a piano riff that sounds as if it\u2019s being played on crystal chandeliers, and ends with a sample of smashing cups.

Here, Wall Street statesman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/bernard-madoff\">Bernie Madoff</a> presides over his \u201crisk-less\u201d trading empire. The man is revered as a magician: a god of finance renowned for being \u201calmost all-knowing\u201d about the market. A warm family atmosphere exudes from his immaculate offices, up and down which Madoff is known to parade with a cigar clamped between his lips, swivelling a computer monitor back into position if he deems it an inch askew. No plants or photo frames are permitted on desks. The colour scheme, replicated in Madoff\u2019s private jet, must be adhered to like the man. Yes, it\u2019s true that he can be a brutal, controlling bully but he\u2019s also a kind, generous, brilliant family man. You get the drift. This is how the myths of such men are spun. Just once, on a serious documentary such as <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81466159\">Madoff: The Monster of Wall Street</a> (Netflix), I\u2019d love a talking head to say: \u201cHe wasn\u2019t an evil genius. He was a nasty, mediocre, morally bankrupt, dangerous arsehole.\u201d Maybe next time.</p><p>Two floors down is another business. Madoff\u2019s secret unregistered investment advisory firm, born in the early years of his career and dodgy from the outset. No trades take place here. Madoff takes the money, promises a return, then gives it to someone else. It\u2019s a Ponzi scheme, and by the time the game\u2019s up more than a decade later it\u2019ll be worth a staggering $64bn. Here, fake paper trails and computer systems are created by working-class high-school graduates groomed from a young age to do Madoff\u2019s dirty work. In stark contrast to the 19th floor, it\u2019s a mess of paper, mid-1980s computers, dot matrix printers, filing cabinets, and an area known as The Cage where, according to one anonymous ex-17th floor employee, \u201ceverything was going down\u201d. \u201cHoly shit,\u201d is a former FBI agent\u2019s response as they recall the moment in 2008 when his team stormed the building and the scale of the biggest criminal enterprise in the history of Wall Street was revealed. \u201cIt was like walking into a time warp.\u201d And yet everyone turned a blind eye, for decades.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/04/madoff-the-monster-of-wall-street-netflix-review-grubby-and-jaw-dropping-from-start-to-finish\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/04/calls-for-public-inquiry-into-abuses-at-manston-asylum-centre-kent-police-investigations-claims-assault", "title": "Calls for public inquiry into abuses at Manston asylum centre in Kent", "date_published": "2023-01-04 14:54:32+00:00", "description": "<p>Legal challenge comes as police confirm investigations into allegations of assaults by guards</p><p>Lawyers and human rights campaigners are calling for a public inquiry into abuse and other mistreatment at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/03/man-who-died-after-being-held-at-manston-asylum-centre-named\">Manston,</a> the controversial Kent processing centre for small boat arrivals, after it emerged that police were investigating allegations of assault.</p><p>A legal challenge calling for a public inquiry has been launched by Duncan Lewis solicitors amid claims from asylum seekers that ill treatment was \u201csystemic\u201d, that staff were involved in abuse and that there were significant failures of planning and management at Manston.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/04/calls-for-public-inquiry-into-abuses-at-manston-asylum-centre-kent-police-investigations-claims-assault\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/04/teacher-trump-maga-hat-free-speech-washington", "title": "Teacher wins free speech case after wearing Trump-themed hat to school", "date_published": "2023-01-04 14:52:12+00:00", "description": "<p>Eric Dodge wore Make America Great Again baseball cap twice but judge found no \u2018tangible disruption\u2019 to Washington school</p><p>A federal appeals court has ruled in favor of a former teacher in Vancouver, Washington, concluding that his wearing a hat supporting Donald Trump to school was protected speech under the first amendment.</p><p>Documents from the ninth circuit court of appeals show that Eric Dodge, a science teacher, brought the Make America Great Again baseball cap to an Evergreen Public Schools building twice before the 2019-2020 school year.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/04/teacher-trump-maga-hat-free-speech-washington\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/04/global-recession-investment-innovation-equality-productivity-policies", "title": "A global recession may be looming, but there is a way out of this rut  | Larry Elliott", "date_published": "2023-01-04 14:35:12+00:00", "description": "<p>Last century investment, innovation and greater equality led to a huge rise in productivity.

Titles slip, they get cancelled, the vision the developers sold us at E3 four years ago turns out to have been somewhat ambitious. Most of the people I know at game studios tell me that a project only truly comes together in the final couple of months of development, so that can often mean at least two years of flailing about with a design document, a game engine and a lot of motion capture footage.

But it is a history Jonathan Sperber handles with brio, summoning evidence from personal anecdotes and high theory, vignettes and statistics. In its range of themes and reconstructions, The Age of Interconnection invites favourable comparison with that other survey of the 20th century, Eric Hobsbawm\u2019s The Age of Extremes. Yet it is quite unlike it. Where the Marxist historian offered a sweeping narrative arc illustrating the relentless advance of capitalism, Sperber dispenses with a unifying theme altogether. It\u2019s a sign of the times: we\u2019ve lost faith in grand narratives, more\u2019s the pity. His framing sheds little light on his period. As every historian knows, all ages are ages of interconnection. </p><p>But what he loses in explanatory depth, he gains in intellectual breadth. Reading the book is a bit like watching a pentathlon. In lieu of fencing, riding, swimming, shooting and running, we have sections on the environment, economy, politics, society and cultural and intellectual life. It appears Sperber has taken Proust\u2019s dictum to heart: \u201cto write on everything to the point of exhaustion\u201d. The exhaustiveness verges on redundancy at times, as in his tortuous excursions on staphylococcus and streptococcus infections, and rocket velocity. Class in the 20th century \u201ctook the form of a hierarchy\u201d, he explains, as if to a Martian. </p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/04/the-age-of-interconnection-by-jonathan-sperber-review-a-breathless-race-through-recent-history\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/04/the-enforcer-review-antonio-banderas-adds-class-to-straight-to-video-throwback", "title": "The Enforcer review \u2013 Antonio Banderas adds class to straight-to-video throwback", "date_published": "2023-01-04 09:00:13+00:00", "description": "<p>The star presumably had one eye on the paycheque in this by-the-numbers thriller about a debt collector punching and shooting his way to bloody revenge</p><p>Antonio Banderas is a class act but there\u2019s only so much class he can reasonably be expected to supply.

When you dig down to the essence of modern rightwing politics, you\u2019re left with little else. This wasn\u2019t always the case. Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan offered clear, coherent visions of society, even if their worship of free markets delivered economic insecurity and stagnating living standards. While today\u2019s Tories and Trumpified Republicans remain committed to defending privileged interests, their driving ambition now seems to be deliberately provoking fury among the progressively minded, much to the delight of their supporters.
