Your number one resource for the entire weeks worth of VR news! This week we have a ton of pretty exciting pre- CES VR news from HTC Vive to new electrostiimulation gloves... just in general this is about to be a crazy week for the entire AR and VR industry.. But one of the most exciting things I caught wind of has to be either the fact that Meta is going to be focusing much harder on PCVR in the future as well as Quest 2 and standalone; but ALSO, some really interesting electrostimulation hydro gels that are in research. \n\nSorry for the different mic this this video, I made it on the road!!\n\nMake sure to be following my twitter and join my discord for some CES micro updates; I will also be posting behind the scenes footage and exclusive coverage on my Patreon!\n\nDiscord: \nhttps://discord.gg/thrill\nTwitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/Thrilluwu\nPatreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/Thrillseeker\n\nGames in the video:\nSong in the Smoke\nBonelab & Boneworks", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}], "source": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCSbdMXOI_3HGiFviLZO6kNA", "title": "Thrillseeker"}}
