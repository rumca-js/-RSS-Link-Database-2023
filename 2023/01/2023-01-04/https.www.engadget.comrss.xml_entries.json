The 11.1.4-channel speaker is capable of 1,170 watts of output with Dolby Atmos and DTS:X onboard for immersive 3D sound. Inside, there are 21 total drivers, six of which are upfiring. That half dozen is three times more than some companies offer, a decision JBL says is meant to make the most out of its MultiBeam spatial audio tech.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2020, JBL first debuted a soundbar <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-06-jbl-dolby-atmos-soundbar-detachable-speakers.html\">with detachable rear satellite speakers</a>. On the Bar 1300X those units pack in one upfiring speaker each and can last up to 10 hours on a charge (they charge when you reattach them to the main bar). Being completely wireless, you're free to position them wherever you like. They also double as Bluetooth speakers, both individually or a stereo pair. Once you remove the speakers, there are snap-on covers included as you'll expose side-pointing tweeters you'll want to protect. In terms of connection, there's one HDMI/ARC to connect to your TV and three additional HDMI inputs.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>During my demo, I was able to watch a chaotic chase scene from <em>Ready Player One. </em>With the rear speakers detached and situated behind me, I was impressed by how immersive the audio was from the 1300X. The footage was loud with lots going on, but the audio remained crisp and clear, and most importantly, the directional audio enhanced the viewing experience. There was also plenty booming bass from the 12-inch wireless subwoofer.&nbsp;</p><p>JBL's PureVoice is available across its entire 2023 lineup to enhance dialogue when other loud sounds are also part of a scene. This feature is impressive as well, boosting spoken words without taking away from everything else that's going on. The tech performs equally well on the $400 entry-level Bar 300 too, an all-in-one option that musters great immersive audio from a single speaker. The 300 is the one model in JBL's 2023 lineup that doesn't come with a sub, though it does have integrated woofers. The company says you can't add a wireless sub either as the Bar 300 isn't compatible with them even if you purchase it separately.&nbsp;</p><p>The $1,700 Bar 1300X, like the rest of JBL's new soundbars, will be available February 19th.</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/hisenses-ux-mini-led-tv-can-produce-2500-nits-of-peak-brightness-221515355.html?src=rss", "title": "Hisense\u2019s UX Mini LED TV can produce 2,500 nits of peak brightness", "date_published": "2023-01-04 22:15:15+00:00", "description": "<p>Once you get past the gimmicks, there\u2019s a common thread among the TVs announced at CES 2023.

According to the company, the chip is the key to what makes the UX special. With control over more than 20,000 Mini LEDs, 5,000 local dimming zones and the industry\u2019s first-ever 16-bit light control algorithm, the Hi-View Engine X allows the UX to produce smoother and more precise dimming and color effects. Hisense claims the UX can achieve three times the \u201cenvironmental contrast\u201d of an OLED TV, and two times the dynamic range. I\u2019ll note here Hisense didn\u2019t say what OLED TV it used as a benchmark. For a more definitive comparison, the company says the UX features a 150,000 to 1 contrast ratio.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Hisense promises the UX is no slouch in the audio department either. The TV incorporates a newly designed seven-speaker system that delivers more than 80 watts of power and Dolby Atmos spatial sound. Other notable features of the UX include support for Dolby Vision, WiFi 6E and AMD Freesync Premium Pro. When the TV ships, it will also include a built-in ATSC 3.0 tuner for those who want to catch broadcast television. Hisense did not announce pricing and availability details for the UX.

This premium set comes with a &quot;smart&quot; case that features a touchscreen display on the outside. That 1.45-inch LED panel gives you access to the core features of the JBL One app, including noise cancellation modes, EQ presets, volume and track controls. The display will also show you battery info for each earbud and the case individually, along with the current time. Those four items line the top while the other tools are available by swiping across screens.&nbsp;</p><p>The display turns on when you open the case or when you tap it, and then you unlock it with a swipe. As you might expect, the touchscreen automatically turns off after a few seconds and JBL has thrown in brightness and wallpaper customization for good measure. Another item the Tour Pro 2 case offers is message and social notifications, but the display doesn't actually show any text for those. It will just let you know you have something waiting.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The touchscreen case is on the larger side for a set of true wireless earbuds, but not drastically so. It's noticeably bigger than most of JBL's lineup, but definitely not the largest I've seen. Of course, the larger stature is understandable since the company needed more room to accommodate a bigger battery for the display. Despite the extra power consumption, JBL is still promising battery life you'd expect in active noise canceling (ANC) buds: up to 8 hours with it on, up to 10 with it off. Plus, the case offers wireless charging and the quick-charge feature gives you four hours of listening in 15 minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>JBL is touting the convenience of not having to look at your phone for the &quot;smart&quot; case with the Tour Pro 2. Of course, you'll still have to carry the case with you and you'll have to stay within Bluetooth range of your connected device. I think the concept could have potential, but I'll need to spend some time doing &quot;regular&quot; everyday things to properly gauge the utility. There are things available on the display that you can't access directly on the earbuds and that you will otherwise have to tap into JBL's app to change, so it could conceivably save you a few seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I'll have to wait until the $250 Tour Pro 2 arrives this spring to judge the audio quality as I wasn't able to do so during a brief CES demo. However, the company has a solid track record in that department so I expect its latest premium set will handle listening habits just fine.&nbsp;</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/dhs-portable-gunshot-detection-system-sds-security-privacy-200346563.html?src=rss", "title": "The Department of Homeland Security says it developed a portable gunshot detection system", "date_published": "2023-01-04 20:03:46+00:00", "description": "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/dhs/\"><ins>Department of Homeland Security (DHS)</ins></a> says its Science and Technology Directorate division has created a portable gunshot detection system with the help of a company called Shooter Detection Systems (SDS).

It sports a 16-inch, 3.2K OLED panel that has the ability to flip into 3D at the touch of a button. This feature, which ASUS calls Spatial Vision, uses eye-tracking and a lenticular lens to deliver two separate images to your eyes. That lets you view things like 3D models and movies with the same amount of depth that you'd expect from a typical 3D screen with glasses.</p><div id=\"9efd4e22b4e641c2885ef8470660a9e9\"></div><p>Now this isn't exactly new \u2014 Acer has been <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/acer-spatiallabs-stereoscopic-view-134520222.html\">hyping up its SpatialLabs technology</a> for years, which was most recently featured in a gaming notebook. ASUS appears to be following a similar path by focusing on professional users first. Aside from the ProArt StudioBook 16 3D OLED, Spatial Vision will also make its way to a slightly less premium   VivoBook Pro mode, which will hopefully cost less. Pricing details aren't available just yet, but you can expect to pay a great deal more than a typical 2D laptop.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Based on a brief demo with ASUS, Spatial Vision looked impressive on the StudioBook 16, though it took a few tries to get it working properly. It turns out ASUS's eye-tracking technology couldn't deal with a face mask easily, which makes me concerned about using this tech in a crowded office. Once I removed my mask though, I was able to view a variety of 3D models up close. When I moved my head side to side, the eye-tracking sensors rotated the models, almost as if they were physically in the room with me. I didn't get to try out any 3D gaming with the StudioBook, but it'll be interesting to see how shooters work with Spatial Vision.</p><figure><img alt=\"ASUS ProArt StudioBook 3D OLED\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/ad2a72d0-8ad9-11ed-bfbb-f0dcd72e59e4\" style=\"height: 1436; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Personally, I'm excited about the possibilities of glasses-free 3D while watching movies. I was able to see 3D cinema-like depth while viewing the trailer from <em>Avatar: The Way of Water</em>. It was a reminder that 3D can be more than a gimmick when done correctly. Unfortunately, Spatial Vision only supports one viewer at a time, but that's true of every glasses-free 3D solution. It's hard enough to track one person's eyes to keep perspective \u2014 adding more people is exponentially more difficult.</p><p>Beyond its 3D capabilities, the ASUS ProArt StudioBook 16 3D OLED looks like a premium workhorse laptop. It's powered by Intel's new 13th-gen HX CPUs, as well as NVIDIA's RTX 4000 graphics. It can fit up to 64GB of DDR5 RAM and 8TB of PCIe 4.0 SSD storage, and thankfully there are two user-replaceable slots for memory and storage. The ProArt's OLED screen can also reach up to 120Hz, which makes it useful for late-night gaming together with its NVIDIA hardware.</p><p>Even though Spatial Vision looks cool, it's still unclear if people actually want glasses-free 3D. I've talked to 3D artists who prefer having a VR headset nearby to fully explore their models, they don't see much value in getting a bit of depth right on their screens. But I don't blame ASUS, Acer and other companies for exploring the possibilities of this technology \u2014 when it works well, it looks absolutely magical.</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/asus-zenbook-oled-ces-2023-190025437.html?src=rss", "title": "ASUS' latest Zenbook Pro 16X OLED has more space to stay cool", "date_published": "2023-01-04 19:00:25+00:00", "description": "<p>Along with its gaming-focused laptops and models that offer 3D visuals without the need for glasses, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/asus/\">ASUS</a> had some upgraded general-purpose systems to show off at CES.

This allows ASUS to add a lightweight but durable finish that\u2019s not only harder than traditional anodized aluminum, because it doesn\u2019t require any strong acids or heavy metals during manufacturing, it\u2019s also more environmentally friendly.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"bfe5c1b555754ad793083e75a840c376\"></div><p>In person, the Zenbook 14X\u2019s ceramic finish feels great. It reminds me of the magnesium chassis Microsoft used on old Surfaces, except that it\u2019s even smoother and better at resisting fingerprints. The downside is that because this is the first time ASUS is using this process, the ceramic coating is only available in one color: sandstone. On the bright side, if you want something a bit more traditional, there\u2019s also a cheaper model with an aluminum finish in Inkwell gray.</p><p>Other updates on the Zenbook 14X include a slightly larger 14.5-inch OLED touchscreen, a faster 120Hz refresh rate and a taller 16:10 aspect ratio. And of course, performance is also getting a bump thanks to new 13th-gen Intel CPUs, support for up to 32GB of DDR5 RAM and even an optional RTX 3050 GPU from NVIDIA.

This led to a longer-than-usual training period, as NASA shelved human-crewed spaceflight for 21 months following Apollo 1. The crew spent many long hours studying the spacecraft's design and construction of the Apollo command and service modules (CSM) to help avoid a repeat tragedy, which could have been perilous for the astronauts and the program. Finally, the crew splashed down on Earth on October 22, 1968, after nearly 11 days in space. Apollo 7 further tested NASA\u2019s equipment and helped pave the way for Apollo 11, where the first humans walked on the moon.</p><figure><img alt=\"Four astronauts laughing and looking to the horizon in a 196\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/64624b80-8c4c-11ed-97fb-cd071b734432\" /><figcaption>Left to right: Walter Schirra, Donn Eisele, Walter Cunningham, Dr. Donald E.

Unfortunately, he also became an outspoken climate change denier. Speaking to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/larrybell/2013/08/06/a-conversation-with-apollo-astronaut-walter-cunningham-about-a-vital-need-to-restore-climate-science-integrity/?sh=54b819ae3345\"><em>Forbes</em></a> in 2013, Cunningham went through a laundry list of fossil-fuel industry talking points, framing modern NASA as an organization controlled by the media while claiming climate-change science was closer to demagoguery than fact.

We\u2019ve been in space now for over 40 years. The first 40 years of aviation, we went from just barely flying to jet transport, you know. And now, we haven\u2019t moved that far since we went into space. The days through Apollo will be remembered; there\u2019ll never be another time like that again.

And the best part is that when you want to hide your power level, because of the smoky plastic in front, the lightbar almost completely disappears when you turn off the LEDs. Thankfully, MSI hasn\u2019t messed around too much as you still get a huge 99.9-watt hour battery (the biggest power pack that you can bring on a plane), a physical webcam shutter and a new IR sensor that works with Windows Hello.</p><p>There\u2019s a healthy selection of ports too, including a full-size SD card reader, one Thunderbolt 4 jack, two USB 3.2 Type-C ports (one of which also supports USB-PD charging) and one USB 3.2 Type-A connector.

After reviewing the old Stealth 15 last year, I felt like the whole line needed a big revamp, and that\u2019s pretty much exactly what we're getting with the Stealth 14 Studio and Stealth 16 Studio. MSI designed a brand new chassis made from a magnesium-aluminum alloy, so it's both strong and light. Then MSI finished it off with two sweet new paint jobs: pure white and star blue.</p><p>On the inside, in addition to a range of 13th-gen Intel CPU and NVIDIA 40-series graphics, MSI added new vapor chambers to keep thermals in check. Meanwhile, just like the Raider, the new Stealth Studios also feature six-speaker audio, 16:10 displays and trackpads that are 33 percent larger than before. And despite their super slim dimensions \u2014 the Stealth 14 studio is just 9mm thick \u2013 MSI still found room to include a microSD card slot, which is great for quickly transferring photos or videos from your camera.</p><figure><img alt=\"To help deliver a super thin and light design, MSI created a new magnesium-aluminum alloy chassis for the new Stealth Studio 14 and 16. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/73a602c0-8a36-11ed-b633-28fa66997a03\" style=\"height: 1200; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">MSI</div></figure><p>As someone who likes laptops that can do a bit of everything without sacrificing portability, the Stealth 14 Studio looks like a really interesting addition to the growing number of 14-inch thin-and-light gaming notebooks.

The SC9 and SE6 are both equipped with Dolby Atmos, but while the former is a more premium-level device, the SE6 is compact all-in-one unit more akin to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sonos-beam-gen-2-review-dolby-atmos-soundbar-130024506.html\">Sonos' Beam</a>. We got out first look at both at CES along with some more info on each unit.</p><p>First, the SC9 is designed to work best with LG's OLED TVs \u2014 specifically the C series. The company has even designed a custom mounting bracket for its TVs so that the soundbar is attached to the display and not the wall. This means that if your television is on a swivel bracket itself, the speaker rotates with it pointing the sound in the same direction as the TV. And speaking of directional audio, LG has equipped the SC9 with three upfiring speakers \u2014 one more than a lot of soundbars offer. That should boost the speaker's Dolby Atmos and DTS:X capabilities.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"6fe0e74153494e399ff3e89757f9e06c\"></div><p>A few features for the SC9 are exclusive to LG TVs. Wow Orchestra syncs the display's speakers with the soundbar for the best audio experience and Wow Interface puts all of the SC9's sound settings on the TV for easy access. The company's Wowcast technology will let you connect to its TVs over Wifi, allowing you to ditch the wired connection if you see fit. In terms of wired connectivity, there are two HDMI ports: an HDMI/ARC for linking with the TV and one additional jack.&nbsp;</p><p>The LG SE6 is another proposition entirely. This compact unit still offers Dolby Atmos in a frame that's cloth wrapped and has softer, rounded edges. As you might expect, LG built the SE6 for people who have smaller spaces or simply want a smaller soundbar in front of their TV. It still offers HDMI/ARC connectivity with your TV with one additional HDMI port alongside. To further reduce any clutter, the SE6 doesn't come with a subwoofer like the SC9 does. However, it does support Wow Orchestra, Wowcast and most of the new features the company added to the more robust SC9.</p><p>LG hasn't announced pricing and availability yet, but we're likely to get that info sometime this spring.&nbsp;</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/meta-eu-fine-personalized-ads-163403318.html?src=rss", "title": "Meta fined $414 million in EU for requiring personalized ads", "date_published": "2023-01-04 16:34:03+00:00", "description": "<p>Meta is facing <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/meta-fined-265-million-euros-over-data-scraping-142937633.html\">yet another European Union fine</a>.

Meta has <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/facebook-warns-developers-ios-14-audience-network-172838009.html\">historically opposed</a> attempts to decline personalized ads, and predicted that Apple's App Tracking Transparency (which lets you ask apps not to track you) could cost it $10 billion in lost ad revenue last year.

Compliance issues first emerged during a safety and soundness examination that the agency conducted in 2020. Following that probe, the DFS ordered Coinbase to hire an independent consultant to review the compliance program and offer recommendations on how to improve in areas in which the agency felt the company was falling short. As a result, Coinbase adopted a plan to bolster its compliance program. However, following an investigation it began in 2021, the DFS determined that the program could not \"keep up with the dramatic and unexpected growth of Coinbase\u2019s business.\" Coinbase now has more than 100 million users worldwide.</p><p>The agency brought in an independent monitor in early 2022 to evaluate the state of the compliance program and work with Coinbase to address the issues \u2014 all while the investigation was ongoing. As part of <a href=\"https://www.dfs.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2023/01/ea20230104_coinbase.pdf\">the settlement</a>, the monitor will work with Coinbase for another year. The DFS can extend that timeframe at its discretion. The agency pointed out that Coinbase has started to address many of the issues and develop \"a more effective and robust compliance program\" under the eyes of the DFS and the monitor, though it noted that the company still isn't moving quickly enough to review older suspicious accounts.</p><p>Other crypto firms have faced penalties in recent months for allegedly violating financial regulations.

It said the system can compensate for \"even significant camera shake, approximately 200 percent more than conventional systems\" with select lenses.

The EVF resolution has been boosted to 3,680K dots compared to 2,360K on the last model, removing one of my biggest complaints.

It supports 4-channel audio via the same XLR microphone adapter, offers a variety video assist functions (wave form, vector scope, zebra, anti-flicker), Lumix Tether for remote USB shooting and wireless streaming via USB tethering (S5IIx only).&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, photography clearly isn't this camera's <em>raison d'etre</em>, but it does offer 7fps RAW shooting speeds in mechanical mode and 30fps in electronic mode with AFC enabled \u2014 up over four times compared to the previous model. And with the phase-detect AF, focus should be more accurate when shooting bursts, meaning fewer blurry photos.</p><p>That takes us to the most interesting part of these cameras, the pricing. The Panasonic S5II is going on sale this month $2,000, making it cheaper than rival full-frame models like the Sony A7 IV and Canon EOS R6 II \u2014 and it's no longer deficient in the autofocus department. While the S5II doesn't come with external RAW video, you'll be able to update to that feature in the future via a $200 firmware update. Panasonic also upped its native lens count to 14 with the launch of the Lumix S 14-28mm F4-5.6 Macro lens arriving in March for $800.</p><p>Meanwhile, the S5IIx will arrive in May 2023 for $2,200. It not only has has the RAW video, but also supports USB-C capture and live streaming, features the S5II will never have \u2014 for just $200 more.

At CES, the streaming device company announced that it'll be building its own smart TVs for the first time. When the Roku TV program debuted in 2014, it was a way for the company to bring its streaming software into TVs built by partners like TCL and Hisense. But now Roku is debuting it's own family of HD and 4K sets ranging from 24 to 75-inches, which are set to arrive in spring.</p><p>Value appears to be the key, as the company says the TVs will range from $119 to $999. That should help Roku's partners to rest easy \u2014 we've seen some sets like the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tcl-8-series-irl-miniled-4k-tv-143059594.html\">TCL Series 8</a> scale into premium $2,000 territory. The company isn't divulging many technical details around these TVs yet, but don't expect them to have some of the nicer features TCL and others are including, like super bright MiniLED panels. Still, Roku's sets may eat into the lower-end offerings from its partners.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img alt=\"Roku TV family breakdown\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/ed34cf30-8a19-11ed-a772-d09045159b0a\" style=\"height: 1200; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Roku</div></figure><p>Chris Larson, Roku's VP of retail strategy, tells Engadget that the company isn't trying to directly compete with existing partners, instead it wants to have a bit more control over how some Roku TVs are produced. For example, Roku is bundling its voice remotes with all of its new sets, even the cheap HD models (Select Series TV's come with the Roku Voice Remote, while Premium Series sets include the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/roku-express-4k-rechargeable-remote-130031381.html\">rechargeable Voice Remote Pro</a>) . That's something the company couldn't push partners to do, especially when it came to budget TVs.</p><p>Down the line, Larson says the new TVs will also bring Roku closer to component suppliers, like the companies behind screen panels and the chips that power smart devices. That could help the company &quot;drive innovation in the TV process.&quot; These new Roku TVs will work alongside Roku's existing home wireless speakers and other home theater equipment, just like partner offerings. But the company could potentially cook up some new features that are exclusive to its TVs \u2014 or at least, capabilities partners may not want to implement.</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-rtx-4070-ti-review-3090-ti-power-for-799-140001316.html?src=rss", "title": "NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti review: 3090 Ti power for $799", "date_published": "2023-01-04 14:00:01+00:00", "description": "<p>NVIDIA's new RTX 40-series GPUs are insanely powerful, but also wildly expensive. That's my big takeaway after reviewing the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-rtx-4090-review-gpu-unholy-amounts-power-130020430.html\">RTX 4090 </a>and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-rtx-4080-review-more-practical-4k-gaming-titan-140009349.html\">RTX 4080</a> \u2014 sure, they're fast, but who can justify spending over $1,000 on a video card? With the RTX 4070 Ti, which debuted at CES 2023, NVIDIA is offering a slightly more reasonable alternative. Starting at $799, it's still fairly pricey, but at least it's under $1,000. And best of all, it's in many ways better than last year's 3090 Ti, which initially cost a whopping $2,000.</p><p>After announcing two RTX 4080 cards a few months ago, NVIDIA surprised us all when it &quot;unlaunched&quot; the $899 12GB model. Given its much lower specs, there were plenty of complaints that it seemed a bit too expensive to be called a 4080. So now we've got the 4070 Ti at $100 less, with the same 7,680 CUDA cores and 12GB of GDDR6X memory that the 4080 was supposed to get. Sometimes, yelling at companies online gets results.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>If you've got a small case, the 4070 Ti may also be the first RTX 40-series GPU you can actually use. Both the 4080 and 4090 Ti were triple-slot behemoths \u2014 they took up a significant chunk of my fairly roomy mid-tower case \u2013 whereas the 4070 Ti just needs two. It also requires far less energy than either of those cards, since it can run with a 700-watt PSU and has a maximum power draw of 285W. (The 4080 requires a 750W PSU, while the demands an 850W unit.) NVIDIA says the 4070 Ti uses around 49 percent less power on average than the 3090 Ti.</p><p>Given where it sits alongside the RTX 4080, the 4070 Ti performed exactly as I expected. It clocked in around 20 percent slower in 3DMark's TimeSpy Extreme Benchmark, as well as the Geekbench 4 Compute test. It was also a full 30 fps slower while playing <em>Halo Infinite</em> in 4K with maxed out graphics settings. Now those numbers may sound disappointing, but I was <em>ecstatic</em> to see them. Sure, it's slower, but the 4070 Ti is actually keeping up fairly well with a card that's $400 more expensive (and in many cases, <em>far</em> more). That's something to celebrate!</p><p></p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>None</p></td><td><p>3DMark TimeSpy Extreme</p></td><td><p>Port Royal (Ray Tracing)</p></td><td><p>Cyberpunk</p></td><td><p>Blender</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti</p></td><td><p>10,624</p></td><td><p>14,163/66fps</p></td><td><p>4K RT DLSS : 78fps</p></td><td><p>7,247</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX</p></td><td><p>12,969</p></td><td><p>14,696/68fps</p></td><td><p>4K FSR RT: 57fps</p></td><td><p>2,899</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT</p></td><td><p>11,688</p></td><td><p>13,247/61fps</p></td><td><p>4K FSRT RT: 50fps</p></td><td><p>3,516</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>NVIDIA RTX 4080</p></td><td><p>12,879</p></td><td><p>17,780/82fps</p></td><td><p>4K DLSS RT: 84fps</p></td><td><p>9,310</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>NVIDIA RTX 4090</p></td><td><p>16,464</p></td><td><p>25,405/117.62 fps</p></td><td><p>4K DLSS RT: 135fps</p></td><td><p>12,335</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p>NVIDIA's DLSS 3 upscaling technology also proved to be incredibly useful once again. I reached a smooth 78fps in <em>Cyberpunk</em><em>2077</em> while playing in 4K with graphics ray tracing settings set to high. And if you need even more frames, you can always bump down to 1440p with DLSS 3, where I managed to reach 90 fps. The 4070 Ti also blew away the Radeon RX 7900 XT and XTX in Blender's benchmark, though that may have been due to unoptimized drivers on AMD's part.&nbsp;</p><section><img alt=\"NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti\" class=\"e2ehero-url\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/cf7569a0-8bea-11ed-9f37-cf81b070fcf5\" /></section><p>If you've got a 1,440p monitor running at 120Hz or more, the 4070 Ti is clearly the more sensible purchase in NVIDIA's new family. <em>Halo Infinite </em>hit 165 fps while maxed out in that resolution, and I saw 130 fps in <em>Control</em> was graphics and ray tracing settings cranked up. And, it's worth noting, I didn't encounter any of the odd driver instability that crashed my system multiple times with the Radeon RX 7900 cards. The 4070 Ti was also twice as fast as both of those AMD GPUs in <em>Control</em> while using DLSS 3 and ray tracing in 1440p and 4K.</p><p>The ASUS TUF 4070 Ti I reviewed retails for $849, but I ran it at the same stock speeds as other $799 cards. The GPU reached 76C after hours of benchmarking and gaming \u2014 that's not as low as the 70C and below temperatures I was seeing on the 4080 and 4090, but those cards also had far more elaborate cooling.</p><p>As impressed as I am by the 4070 Ti, every prospective GPU buyer should know that NVIDIA's 30-series GPUs are still great! And while they don't have DLSS 3, they still have excellent DLSS 2 upscaling. Best of all, they're falling in price now that another generation of cards have arrived. You can snag 3060s easily for less than $400, while I've seen 3070s falling below $600 regularly. I'm sure we'll see a 4060 card later this year, but if you're in a rush, don't look down on older hardware.</p><p></p><figure><img alt=\"NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/cf76c930-8bea-11ed-956f-60f6863a1ddd\" style=\"height: 1206; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>If anything, the RTX 4070 Ti is awful news for AMD. The Radeon RX 4700 XT and XTX are both faster GPUs in many benchmarks, but once you start enabling ray tracing, they practically crumble. And worst of all, they're $100 and $200 more, respectively. Personally, I'd rather the power of DLSS and the stability of NVIDIA's hardware and software, over the raw speed of those AMD cards.</p><p>While I miss the days of \u201creasonable\u201d video card prices under $500, the 4070 Ti still feels like a dose of sanity. Unless you\u2019re a high-level streamer or pro gamer, there\u2019s little reason to spend four figures on a video card. $799, though? That\u2019s doable. And if anything, it pushes the prices of other hardware down considerably. Even if you don\u2019t buy the 4070 Ti, we should all be thankful it exists.</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-reportedly-integrating-chatgpt-technology-into-bing-131502579.html?src=rss", "title": "Microsoft is reportedly integrating ChatGPT's technology into Bing", "date_published": "2023-01-04 13:15:02+00:00", "description": "<p>Microsoft's Bing search engine might soon become more attuned to users' needs and return results in a more human-like fashion.

Microsoft <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-22-microsoft-invests-openai-azure-supercomputing.html\">invested $1 billion</a> in OpenAI back in 2019, and more recent reports said it's in talks with the Elon Musk-founded startup for a follow-up investment. Now, <em>The Information</em> is reporting that Microsoft's initial investment included an agreement to incorporate some aspects of GPT into Bing.</p><p>OpenAI developed GPT as a language model that uses deep learning to generate human-like text responses. Late last year, it launched a program called <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/engadget-podcast-lensa-ai-avatar-images-chatgpt-133057497.html\">ChatGPT</a> that quickly skyrocketed in popularity due to its ability to return responses that seem like they were written by actual people. Educators <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/04/ai-bot-chatgpt-stuns-academics-with-essay-writing-skills-and-usability\">raised concerns</a> that it could easily be used for cheating, since those who tried the tool said they would've given its responses a good grade if a student claimed to have written them. ChatGPT is free for now, but OpenAI intends to charge for its use in the future.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>What GPT integration would mean for Bing isn't clear at this point. It doesn't have the capability to scrape the internet for results, so Microsoft will still use its own search engine technology. However, <em>The Information</em> said it could help Bing present results to users in a friendlier way. A source \"familiar with Bing's systems\" told the publication that Microsoft could use the technology to present search results as full sentence answers with the source for the information. If Bing suggests related queries to the original one, GPT could explain their relevance in a meaningful manner. The technology could help Bing suggest better keywords or key phrases to users, as well.</p><p>Microsoft could launch GPT integration as soon as this March,<em> The Information </em>says, so we might hear a confirmation of this report \u2014 along with more details, if it is indeed true \u2014 in the near future.&nbsp;</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/citizens-new-cz-smart-watch-uses-ai-to-determine-your-level-of-alertness-130530865.html?src=rss", "title": "Citizen's new smartwatch uses AI to determine your level of alertness", "date_published": "2023-01-04 13:05:30+00:00", "description": "<p>Citizen has announced its latest CZ Smart smartwatches that feature a built-in AI &quot;self-care advisor,&quot; the company said.

Adapted from the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-18-hp-elite-dragonfly-hands-on-sub-1-kg.html\">enterprise-centric Elite Dragonfly series</a>, the new Dragonfly Pro and Dragonfly Pro Chromebook are designed for consumers who are overwhelmed by specs. HP believes that for some people, having to choose from 30 different laptop configurations of RAM, storage and other options is a deterrent. For that reason, the Dragonfly Pro and Pro Chromebook come in preset configurations and you really only need to decide whether you want the Pro or the Chromebook (though for the Pro you can choose one of two preconfigured models).</p><p>Both notebooks have 14-inch screens, with the Chromebook for some reason featuring a higher resolution of 2,560 x 1,600. The Windows machine, meanwhile, runs at 1,920 x 1,200. Both systems are also fairly similar in size, measuring almost exactly the same, though the Chromebook is 0.2 pounds lighter.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Frankly, I was a little underwhelmed by the design of both new Dragonfly laptops. I\u2019ve grown used to the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-27-hp-elite-dragonfly-review.html\">sleek chassis, premium finishes and attractive design of the Elite Dragonfly</a> series, and the consumer models are just a little less refined. Put it this way: If the Elite Dragonfly devices were Hermes bags, then the Dragonfly Pro and Pro Chromebook are Michael Kors purses. Still good-looking, but not quite as high-end.</p><div id=\"93e2d58f50b24605a3769dc3b457728e\"></div><p>The two machines are different in quirky ways. For example, the Chromebook has an 8-megapixel webcam and has an LCD that gets as bright as 1,200 nits, while the Windows version packs a 5MP IR camera with a shutter and only goes up to 400 nits. The Pro also has a haptic trackpad and a fingerprint scanner, as well as Gorilla Glass on its screen.</p><p>The Chromebook doesn\u2019t have any of those, but it sports an RGB keyboard that offers customizable colors. Using HP\u2019s software, I could pick any shade on a spectrum or use the rainbow template, which is the only way to get the keyboard to show more than one color simultaneously.</p><p>HP also collaborated with Google on the Dragonfly Pro Chromebook\u2019s software to incorporate an element of the Material You UI from Android. Using the laptop\u2019s specific software, you can pick one of a selection of wallpapers and have the system determine what the image\u2019s dominant colors are. It will then generate some hues for you to set as the computer\u2019s color scheme.</p><figure><img alt=\"A person typing on a black HP Dragonfly Pro Chromebook. The keys are backlit in rainbow colors, and the screen shows the wallpaper selection page.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/60128390-8c03-11ed-bbfb-2e68aaab61b9\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford / Engadget</div></figure><p></p><p>While the Pro Chromebook comes with a 12th-generation Intel Core i5 processor, the Windows version exclusively uses AMD processors. In fact, HP worked with AMD on a custom Ryzen 7 chip for the Dragonfly Pro, using the chip maker\u2019s adaptive platform management framework to balance power consumption and speed boosts when necessary.</p><p>Possibly the most interesting feature of the Dragonfly Pro lies on its keyboard. Specifically, HP added a column of four hot keys to the right, offering shortcuts to a new control center, 24/7 dedicated tech support, camera settings and a programmable button. The control center is a portal containing various different settings that used to exist in separate HP apps, while the company is launching a support concierge service just for Dragonfly owners to answer questions specific to the series. These are staffed by actual people who HP says will have been trained on the Dragonfly Pro machines.</p><p>The camera settings button pulls up HP\u2019s as-yet-unnamed app that offers system-level controls over the feed that apps like Zoom, Meet or Teams receive. I was able to use the app to tweak the intensity of the background blur, compensate for low light or backlighting or keep a subject in frame. I was particularly impressed by the key framing tool that basically acts like a green screen to remove parts of the background. Since the software at the demo wasn\u2019t final, I can\u2019t vouch for its performance, and I didn\u2019t use it on an actual call.</p><p>Finally, the programmable key can be set up to launch an app like Excel or Outlook, or go straight to a website on the default browser or open a file or folder. There\u2019s no option to stack actions at the moment, so the usefulness of this button feels fairly limited. Still, it\u2019s nice to have an option for frequently used programs.</p><p>Both the Dragonfly Pro and Pro Chromebook's batteries should last up to 16 hours depending on how you use them, and support fast charge to get you to 50 percent in 30 minutes. The Dragonfly Pro and Pro Chromebook will be available this spring, and don't supplant the company's existing flagship Spectre series. HP hasn't shared pricing information yet, so we'll likely have to wait till closer to retail availability to find that out.</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/jbl-bar-series-soundbars-ces-2023-130016386.html?src=rss", "title": "JBL's 2023 soundbar lineup offers Dolby Atmos on all five models", "date_published": "2023-01-04 13:00:16+00:00", "description": "<p>When JBL debuted <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-06-jbl-dolby-atmos-soundbar-detachable-speakers.html\">its first Dolby Atmos soundbar</a> at CES 2020, the company did so in a unit with detachable rear surround sound speakers.

DTS:X joins Atmos for a second immersive audio option, powered by six upfiring drivers. Plus, Harman's MultiBeam tech works to enhance that spatial sound. Like the Bar 9.1 three years ago, the 1300X and the rest of JBL's 2023 soundbars that offer detachable rear speakers allow you to remove the ends of the soundbar to position wireless satellite units behind you. The 1300X also comes with a 12-inch subwoofer while the rest of the company's new lineup (except the Bar 300) come with a 10-inch wireless sub.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Both the Bar 1000 and Bar 700 have those detachable speakers and offer Atmos in 7.1.4- and 5.1.2-channel setups respectively. The Bar 1000 packs in four upfiring drivers while the 700 has two. And while the 880-watt Bar 1000 does offer MultiBeam to lend a hand with immersive audio, the 620-watt Bar 700 does not. The Harman tech is on the Bar 500 though, a 5.1-channel option that still supports Dolby Atmos despite a lack of upfiring drivers. And lastly, the Bar 300 in an all-in-one setup with integrated subwoofers.&nbsp;</p><p>JBL says all five soundbars have PureVoice, a feature that optimizes the audio for clear dialogue even when loud sound effects are also in use. The entire lineup features WiFi connectivity, JBL One app support and customizable EQ settings. All of them can be voice controlled via Alexa, Google Assistant or Siri and all five offer AirPlay 2, Alexa Multi-Room Music (MRM) and Chromcast built-in.</p><p>The company says all of its 2023 soundbars will be available on February 19th. When they are, you can expect to pay $1,699.95 for the Bar 1300X, $1,199.95 for the Bar 1000, $899.95 for the Bar 700, $599.95 for the Bar 500 and $399.95 for the Bar 300.&nbsp;</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/polys-voyager-free-60-might-be-the-coolest-earbuds-for-work-yet-130016200.html?src=rss", "title": "Poly\u2019s Voyager Free 60+ might be the slickest earbuds for work yet", "date_published": "2023-01-04 13:00:16+00:00", "description": "<p>There are so many wireless earbuds on the market it\u2019s gotten hard for a new pair to stand out, especially when it comes to enterprise-focused options. But Poly\u2019s Voyager Free 60+ buds may have just broken through thanks to a couple of innovative features.</p><p>Like many of its rivals, the Voyager Free 60+ features a true wireless design and comes with a Qi charging case. The stems of each bud supports touch controls for adjusting playback, while three mics and active noise cancellation help ensure both your voice and your audio sounds clear. However, where things get interesting is when you check out the display built into the case, which is only the second of its kind following the release of <a href=\"https://news.jbl.com/en-CEU/217264-smart-innovation-meets-ultimate-high-fidelity-audio-with-the-new-jbl-tour-pro-2-true-wireless-and-tour-one-m2-headphones\"><ins>JBL\u2019s Tour PRO 2</ins></a> buds back in August.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"795b0013384a481bb5f57f76b61f438d\"></div><p>By tapping and swiping on the display, you can quickly do things like adjust volume, toggle ANC, check battery status, switch between paired devices and more. This means you can leave your phone or laptop in your bag or pocket while you focus on your call. And with the Voyager Free 60+ capable of remembering up to eight different devices (with two being paired at the same time), multi-device management is a cinch.</p><p>However, my favorite thing about the Voyager Free 60+ is its broadcast mode. This allows you to use the included 3.5mm to USB-C cable to connect the case to an older device with a headphone jack (like when you\u2019re on an airplane), so you can watch movies during a flight without needing to carry a second set of headphones around. Sure, it\u2019s a bit of a niche situation, but for frequent travelers, it\u2019s a great way to streamline your luggage.</p><figure><img alt=\"The screen on the Voyager Free 60+'s charging case can be used to quickly adjust settings like volume, ANC, and more. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/85c9f430-8a5d-11ed-9afa-bb88dbfc19ff\" style=\"height: 1200; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Additionally, despite being made for the enterprise world, the Voyager Free 60+ sound great. Mids and highs are crisp and vibrant, and while I\u2019d like a bit more thump in lower tones, there\u2019s still more than an acceptable amount of bass. I also appreciate some of the smaller details like the inclusion of different-sized eartips and a bonus travel pouch that holds both the charging case and all of the earbuds\u2019 included accessories. You even get the ability to choose between a USB-A or USB-C dongle for simple pairing with a phone or laptop. And because the earbuds support dual-mode connectivity, you can also connect to devices via Bluetooth.</p><figure><img alt=\"By using the included 3.5mm to USB-C cable, you can plug older devices into the Voyager Free 60+'s case and use broadcast mode to send audio wirelessly to the earbuds. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/e294fd40-8a5d-11ed-be1d-c6fb88556d50\" style=\"height: 1200; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>The biggest challenge for Poly\u2019s Voyager Free 60+, though, is that priced at $360, it costs more than a lot of other high-end earbuds including the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/airpods-pro-review-second-generation-130048218.html\"><ins>AirPods Pro</ins></a> and the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-wf-1000xm4-review-160006474.html\"><ins>Sony WF-1000XM4</ins></a>. Now I should mention that there will be a slightly less expensive non-plus version of the Voyager Free 60 buds that come with a more traditional case without a built-in screen, but even these cheaper models will start at $299.99. So despite some fancy features that could be very useful for business travelers, unless you can sweet talk your company\u2019s IT department into upgrading your gadget kit, they might be hard sell when they come out sometime in March.</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/hyper-x-is-leaning-into-3-d-printing-for-its-next-wave-of-gaming-accessories-130010794.html?src=rss", "title": "HyperX leans into 3D printing for its next wave of gaming accessories", "date_published": "2023-01-04 13:00:10+00:00", "description": "<p>Last year HyperX broke into a new hardware category with its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/hyper-x-armada-25-hands-on-specs-price-release-no-stand-no-problem-101534103.html\"><ins>Armada monitors</ins></a>. But this year at CES the company is taking things in an entirely different direction with the introduction of its new 3D-printed gaming accessories.</p><p>With the HX3D line, HyperX is leaning on the 3D color printing capabilities of its parent company (HP) to create a new range of personalized peripherals that would be difficult to make with more traditional manufacturing processes. That said, HyperX is starting off small (both literally and figuratively), with its first product being a limited edition Cozy Cat keycap (which is compatible with most Cherry-style switches) that's slated to go on sale sometime in January for $19.99.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"82e237c0192746e698df2c756751a44b\"></div><p>Now unless you\u2019re deep into the mechanical keyboard community, $20 for a single keycap might seem like a lot. And it is. However, when compared to custom hand-painted keys that can go for between $50 and $100 (or more), HyperX\u2019s 3D-printed options don\u2019t seem quite as ridiculous while still offering a surprising amount of detail.</p><p>But the most exciting thing is that the company has already created a huge variety of other concept products including an entire line of animal-themed keycaps, mic stands, headphone faceplates and more. And after seeing them in person, I have to say the detail on some of the more intricate offerings is rather impressive. I\u2019m personally a fan of the dragon-themed headphone holder and the mic stand that looks like a cuter version of the mushroom people from <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p><figure><img alt=\"HyperX's first 3D-printed gaming accessory will be its Cozy Cat keycap, which will start at 19.99.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/3b9b9630-8a5c-11ed-afef-e956b4f8e44f\" style=\"height: 1200; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption>The Cozy Cat (center) will be HyperX's first 3D-printed key cap with potentially more on the way depending on demand.&nbsp;</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>The challenge for HyperX, though, is breaking into a new segment without much in the way of established characters or content. Because as adorable as the little cats, ducks and unicorns are, these accessories are more of a style play when compared to the company\u2019s more traditional products which largely compete on specs and features. Granted, HyperX may already have a small built-in fanbase thanks to its roster of sponsored ambassadors like Pokimane, Gordon Hayward and Daigo. But still, it\u2019s hard to say if this endeavor will be a boom or bust.</p><p>Alternatively, for people looking for more standard peripherals, at CES 2023 HyperX is also launching two new gaming mice and the company\u2019s first officially licensed Xbox controller. The new Pulsefire Haste 2 mouse is designed for FPS gamers who prefer a lightweight mouse for enhanced reaction times, and it\u2019s available in both wired and wireless models starting at $59.99 and $79.99.</p><figure><img alt=\"Some other 3D-printed concept products HyperX is testing out include customized mic and headphone stands. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/6d21a820-8a5c-11ed-bcf5-e955453131f6\" style=\"height: 1200; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption>Here are some other 3D-printed sample concepts HyperX is considering for future release.&nbsp;</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Both mice come with HyperX\u2019s 26K sensor that supports polling rates of up to 8,000Hz along with RGB lighting and customizable buttons. The main differences are that the wired version weighs a scant 53 grams while the wireless version comes in a bit heavier at 62 grams and features a battery life of up to 100 hours on a single charge. In some brief testing, I actually found the wired model to be so light that it threw off my aim, though that\u2019s almost certainly because I generally prefer mice with a bit more heft.</p><figure><img alt=\"In terms of more traditional products, at CES 2023 HyperX is launching wired and wireless versions of its Pulsefire Haste 2 mouse and its first officially-licensed Xbox controller in the Clutch Gladiate. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/a1b7e040-8a5c-11ed-b6bf-ec6f4a0b56cd\" style=\"height: 1200; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Meanwhile, for console gamers, HyperX\u2019s Clutch Gladiate controller doesn\u2019t offer much in the way of extra frills or features.

In hand, the Glaidate feels a touch smaller than Microsoft's first-party controller, and it\u2019s a bit lighter too because, unlike the standard model, HyperX\u2019s gamepad is wired-only. That said, I do enjoy the trigger locks in the back, which let you adjust the pull length of LT and RT from long to short when needed.</p><p>The Clutch Gladiate controller will be available first in March, followed by both versions of the Pulsefire Haste 2 mouse sometime in April.</p><p></p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/jbl-tour-pro-2-tour-one-m2-announced-130009195.html?src=rss", "title": "JBL debuts true wireless earbuds with a touchscreen 'smart' case", "date_published": "2023-01-04 13:00:09+00:00", "description": "<p>For its latest Tour Series true wireless earbuds, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/jbl-true-wireless-earbuds-lineup-ces-2022-130052913.html\">JBL</a> is taking an interesting approach to the wireless charging case.

DLSS 3 is a big reason for that \u2013 just like with the other 4000-series cards, it uses machine learning to generate entire frames, rather than the pixels DLSS 2 created.

The Stellantis brand is <a href=\"https://www.chrysler.com/chrysler-innovation.html\">debuting</a> a Synthesis cockpit concept at CES that previews what you can expect in next-generation electric vehicles. Most notably, the two-seat demonstrator is built around <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-drive-pilot-level-3-autonomous-video-220158620.html\">Level 3 self-driving</a> technology \u2014 that is, it assumes you'll have your hands off the steering wheel in limited conditions.</p><p>The 37.2 inches of infotainment display area provides the usual media and navigation controls, but is also designed to be useful when autonomous driving is active. You can participate in video calls, play games, sing karaoke or even create your own music.

A virtual assistant syncs your schedule, smart home and weather updates with the car. Synthesis can factor your calendar and charge status into your route, or turn the house lights on when you arrive home. The cockpit can learn your preferences, and recommend restaurants with good charging and parking spaces. Over-the-air updates promise easier improvements for both the cabin tech and the self-driving system.</p><p>Chrysler is also hopping on the trend of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/for-polestar-the-twos-are-anything-but-terrible-130059155.html\">eco-friendly interiors</a>. Both seats have vegetable-tanned covers with &quot;upcycled&quot; trim, while the instrument panel surface is made entirely from recycled plastics. Even the floor uses responsibly-sourced walnut, Chrysler says. The overall look was inspired by last year's Airflow EV concept.</p><p>It's not certain just when you'll see elements of Synthesis in Chrysler cars. However, the company previously said it would introduce its first EV in 2025 and provide a full portfolio in 2028.

Unveiled at CES 2023, the Fufuly is yet another anxiety-reducing cushion from the Japanese company, but this time featuring a gentle rhythmical pulsation as the main therapeutic tool. The idea is that when you're hugging a Fufuly, its life-like behavior stimulates your belly to induce slower and deeper breathing. Despite its thought-bubble shape (supposedly to evoke the image of a puff of air), the cushion felt more like a mellow creature dozing off in my arms. I even mistook the quiet mechanical noise as a cat's purr, to which CEO Shunsuke Aoki assured me this was purely a coincidence.</p><p>For this project, Yukai Engineering partnered with the University of Tokyo, which researched on the &quot;phenomenon of rhythmical synchronization between individuals or between individuals and objects&quot; as they interact with one another. Think how we usually feel calm when we're holding a baby or pet in our arms \u2014 it's all subconscious. &quot;Using the cushion for just 5 minutes can reduce users\u2019 stress levels and make them more alert,&quot; according to Aoki.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"51adc35f0fce4becbb7ae707cc7e163e\"></div><p>The Fufuly comes with three operating modes: you have the self-explanatory &quot;regular&quot; and &quot;deep&quot; modes to suit your calming needs, with the third mode based on common relaxation breathing techniques. Sadly, we couldn't change modes with the prototype on the show floor. Aoki added that his team already had the idea of a pulsating cushion around the same time as the Qoobo cat tail pillow, but in the end, they decided to develop the latter first.</p><figure><img alt=\"Lightony\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/0d9332d0-8bdc-11ed-bfff-94bc06033d46\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Richard Lai/Engadget</div></figure><p>Another new device shown off by Yukai Engineering was Lightony, a cute humanoid bedside lamp which literally nods off after a while.

The setup uses four bands, one around your chest, hips, knees and ankles, which give your digital avatar the ability to dance and high kick their way around.

The top plate, where you\u2019ll find the joystick and action buttons, can be flipped out of the way to free your hand up for other things. In the demo, a user can stop playing, flip the joystick over to the other side of their hand and drink from a can without having to remove their VR gear, or put it down on the floor.</p><p>As for pricing, Haritoria X Wireless will set you back $350, although there\u2019s no word yet on when it\u2019ll be available either in Japan or Stateside.

Like the rest of the Gram line, the Style is an impressively thin and light laptop for its size, with the 16-inch model coming in at 1.2kg (2.7 pounds). In fact, it's so light that the bicep curls and front raises I did using the laptop didn't feel like any work at all (weird flex, I know).</p><p>Speaking of flex, though, I did feel the 16-inch Style yield a little under my grip during the front raises, and it's worth reminding you that we've had issues with the build quality on <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-30-lg-gram-17-review-price-specs-big-screen-thin-light.html\">previous Grams</a>. Though nothing ever actually broke during our testing, in general Gram laptops have felt less premium than other ultraportables, and almost plasticky. The Style has what LG calls a &quot;glass design,&quot; and I use quotes because the entire laptop isn't actually made of glass. In fact, even after I picked it up, I couldn't tell what the back of the device was made of, and had to ask. While the base of the notebook is made from a nano-magnesium alloy, the lid and keyboard deck, where the iridescent finish is, are Gorilla Glass 3.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>That keyboard deck is also another highlight here. At first glance, it looks like there's nothing below the keyboard, but drag your finger across the surface and two LED lines light up to indicate the boundaries of the trackpad. When I tried doing that, I didn't even feel a difference between the touchpad and the rest of the deck \u2014 looks like LG took this &quot;hidden trackpad&quot; in a tactile sense as well. It's an interesting concept that might have aesthetic benefits, but I'm not sure it will appeal to those who rely on touch to figure out where the trackpad is.</p><p>The Style laptops also feature anti-glare OLED screens, which was so effective that I initially thought this was just a really bright and colorful LCD.

With the display and speaker combo, Samsung explains that Q-Symphony can leverage 22 total audio channels with the help of the processor inside one of the company's compatible televisions. The company says the Q990C can also &quot;pair acoustically automatically&quot; with its TVs so that the entire system is tuned for its best performance. When paired with a Samsung TV, the soundbar handles the dialogue while surrounding audio comes from the display's speakers. The company says this contributes to improved 3D audio.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img alt=\"Samsung HW-Q990C soundbar\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/1f167740-8bde-11ed-b6eb-943693cbf49d\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>To tailor the entire set to your living room or home theater, Samsung's SpaceFit calibration is onboard. The company explains that this technology leverages AI to adjust individual driver frequencies and gain levels to properly fill a room. A nighttime mode adjusts for low-volume listening, Adaptive Sound 2.0 uses AI to optimize audio and Game Pro 2.0 tweaks the settings for various genres. The HW-Q990C is also a SmartThings hub, offering voice control and the ability to change things inside the SmartThings app.&nbsp;</p><p>For more compact spaces, the HW-G60C is an all-in-one option that uses a combination of beamforming tech and virtualized Dolby Atmos to create a 3D feel. Samsung says this more compact unit can also be used as both computer speakers and a smart speaker thanks to echo-canceling microphones and bi-directional audio. HDMI/ARC, USB, AirPlay 2 and Chromecast connectivity are all here and there's customizable LED lighting and specific sound profiles for gaming. What's more, Samsung says a set of four microphones are tuned for chat by isolating voices, which the company explains will also help when summoning a virtual assistant.&nbsp;</p><p></p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/diver-x-vr-gloves-could-be-a-more-affordable-way-to-get-hands-on-in-the-metaverse-025324699.html?src=rss", "title": "Driver-X's gloves are a cheaper way to get hands on in the metaverse", "date_published": "2023-01-04 02:53:24+00:00", "description": "<p>There are two words that will make gamers of a certain age go weak at the knees: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Glove\">Power Glove</a>.

Now, the French health-tech company is making a foray into the world of medical analysis, building a device to scan people\u2019s urine. It\u2019s initially intended as a way of supporting decentralized clinical trials, the company hopes to offer it as a consumer health-tech device in the future. Say hello to U-Scan.</p><p>U-Scan is a pebble-shaped device that hangs from a plastic tab on the side of your toilet bowl, much like a deodorizer block. The hardware, 90mm in diameter, is intended to sit on the porcelain where most people\u2019s pee streams would land. There\u2019s a collection inlet at the lowest point, and a sensor will detect the presence of urine and trigger a pump you pull a small quantity into its body. From there, the sample is pumped into a microfluidic system which triggers a chemical reaction.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Sitting underneath the U-Scan itself will be a cartridge, which contains the specific test that you\u2019re looking for. The company has, so far, partnered with two medical centers in Europe to explore ways of discovering renal lithiasis and bladder cancer. It\u2019s hoped that the system will eventually be used to mass-screen for cancer markers and support medical studies.</p><p>In terms of the consumer units, the company has developed U-Scan Cycle Sync, designed to be used for period tracking. The idea is to provide detailed, regular testing to enable fine-grain cycle tracking without the need for calendar apps. As well as predicting your menstrual cycle, the system says it\u2019ll predict your ovulation window, hydration levels and nutrient levels.</p><p>The other is U-Scan Nutri Balance, which offers a \u201cdetailed metabolic guide to hydration and nutrition.\u201d This will look at your water balance, nutrient levels, fat metabolism and quantities of vitamin C found in your pee. Most crucially, you'll be able to monitor your ketone levels, as well as the pH of your urine, good for determining if you\u2019re eating a healthy enough diet.</p><p>When processed, the results of the tests are shared to a server over WiFi or Bluetooth, and then the cartridge will reset with a fresh test pod. The company says that U-Scan is sufficiently smart to distinguish different users, such as various family members in a home, and separate tests accordingly.</p><p>Withings has also said that its system conforms to the highest security standards, and that its data will always be held in France, in a GDPR-compliant setup. It says that U-Scan will run for three months before needing a recharge (over USB-C) and a replacement cartridge.</p><p>In terms of pricing, and availability, you\u2019ll expect that whatever date Withings says, it may be delayed due to regulatory approvals. The company says that U-Scan will be first made available in Europe at some point in Q2, 2023, with the Nutri Balance and Cycle Sync cartridges. A starter kit, with one reader and cartridge, will be priced at \u20ac499.95 ($530), while replacement cartridges are expected to cost \u20ac30 ($31).

Rather than inflating a sleeve around the top of your arm, you\u2019ll be able to monitor your blood pressure with a fingertip clip.

It's introducing a Smart Sprinkler Controller (shown below) that, in tandem with matching soil sensors, can automatically tweak watering schedules on a zone-by-zone basis. Your yard should only get the water it really needs \u2014 Moen claims it can reduce the water use of a typical home by 30 percent. Whether or not that's true, you'll probably appreciate the season- and weather-based adjustments that can save you from watering in the middle of a rainstorm.</p><p>You also won't have to rip up your lawn to get started. You only have to stick the sensors in the soil, where they can stay flush with the ground. You don't have to bury cables or watch <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/what-to-look-for-in-an-electric-lawn-mower-161536380.html\">where you're mowing</a>. The Sprinkler Controller attaches to your existing irrigation system within half an hour, and the sensors can be ready to go in less than five minutes.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img alt=\"Moen Smart Sprinkler Controller and Soil Sensor\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/f7674420-8ba8-11ed-bfff-441b4ab91385\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Moen</div></figure><p>Not surprisingly, Moen is using this as a chance to reel you into its broader smart home system. If you have the Flo Smart Water Monitor and Shutoff, you can watch out for leaks around the house without worrying that your sprinklers will shut off the home's water supply.</p><p>The initial outlay may be pricey. Moen will release the devices in early February, starting at $180 for an eight-zone controller and $235 for its 16-zone counterpart. Sensors will be available for $70 each, or $180 for a three-pack. However, the company is clearly betting that its system will cut your water bill enough to justify the expense, not to mention spare you constant manual adjustments to watering schedules. The sprinkler tech could also reduce your home's impact on the environment. That's particularly helpful in California and other regions where water conservation is frequently important.</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/volkswagen-unveils-its-upcoming-id-7-ev-sedan-at-ces-2023-005913547.html?src=rss", "title": "Volkswagen unveils its upcoming ID.7 EV sedan at CES 2023", "date_published": "2023-01-04 00:59:13+00:00", "description": "<p>Volkswagen's ID family of electric vehicles, which already includes the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/volkswagen-officially-unveils-its-id-buzz-ev-181057412.html\">highly-anticipated ID.Buzz</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/vw-2023-id4-pricing-release-date-165237007.html\">more sedate ID.4</a>, grew by one on Tuesday.
