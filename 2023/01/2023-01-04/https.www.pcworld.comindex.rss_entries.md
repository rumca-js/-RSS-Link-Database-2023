<p>LG unveiled the LG Gram UltraSlim laptop at CES and, boy, did it make a crater-sized impression on me. The 15.6-inch laptop weighs a jaw dropping 2.2 pounds. As for the width, it measures a mindblowing 0.43 inches, which is about as thin as a cell phone. However, according to this <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.laptopmag.com/news/i-held-the-worlds-thinnest-laptop-at-ces-2023-heres-why-the-lg-gram-ultraslim-blew-me-away&amp;xcust=2-1-1446620-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">article on LaptopMag</a>, the port side is a bit thicker at 0.49 inches. LG laptops are generally known for being both portable and powerful, but this is plain ridiculous and I mean that in the best way possible. Don&rsquo;t let the featherlight chassis fool you, though. It&rsquo;s packing some heat underneath the hood.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="LG UltraSlim laptop" class="wp-image-1446676" height="440" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/0-news-lg-gram-laptop-line-up-for-2023-revealed-includes-ultraslim-model-image1-sgviouyx72-jpg.webp" width="660" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">LG</p></div>



<p>The LG Gram UltraSlim comes with an Intel Core 13th-gen Raptor Lake chip, Intel Iris Xe graphics, up to 16GB of RAM, and up to 1TB of SSD storage. The 15.6-inch OLED display has a resolution of 1920&times;1080 and, according to LG, a maximum brightness of 400 nits. If that brightness number holds true, then you&rsquo;re in for a truly vibrant picture. This machine also has MIL-810H military certifications, which means it should be able to withstand bumps and minor falls. Just don&rsquo;t go throwing this thing around all willy-nilly. The hardware inside is indeed fragile.</p>



<p>I love tech that pushes design boundaries and the Gram UltraSlim certainly does just that. I&rsquo;m unable to unearth any availability or pricing information at this time, as I&rsquo;m not physically at CES in Las Vegas, but I reached out to LG for this information and will update this article accordingly.</p>

## ChatGPT’s astounding AI chatbot could be Bing’s next killer feature

<p>Microsoft may be preparing to launch a version of its Bing search engine that&rsquo;s powered by the ChatGPT AI chatbot, according to a new report.</p>



<p>The Information <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsoft-and-openai-working-on-chatgpt-powered-bing-in-challenge-to-google&amp;xcust=2-1-1446692-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">reports</a> that the feature could launch by the end of March. It&rsquo;s certainly plausible, given that <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://openai.com/blog/microsoft/&amp;xcust=2-1-1446692-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Microsoft invested $1 billion into OpenAI in 2019</a> &mdash; an investment which is looking and more and more perceptive as time goes on. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1424575/chatgpt-is-the-future-of-ai-chatbots.html">As we wrote last December</a>, ChatGPT looks like it could currently make the first two years of high-school essays meaningless. (You can <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://chat.openai.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1446692-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">try it yourself</a>, for free, to see if you agree.) ChatGPT doesn&rsquo;t just serve as a source of information, but can also construct longer essays and arguments supporting a thesis, as well as bringing in additional facts from outside sources. In that it differs from a traditional search engine, which usually strives to answer a simple question.</p>



<p>If Bing did implement a version of ChatGPT into its search engine, it would have another effect; instead of pointing users to third-party content, Bing would capture more of it on its own. Typically, a search engine aggregates knowledge from third parties, then links direct users to what hopefully is an authoritative source of information. But search engines including Bing and Google have quietly aggregated more and more information on the search results page itself &mdash; from shopping links to images to general information &mdash; robbing those other websites of traffic and revenue. </p>



<p>There&rsquo;s another difference. If you&rsquo;ve ever used a Google-powered smart speaker, you know that Google makes an explicit effort to source its information from a third-party site, naming the site in its response. ChatGPT has never done so, in our experience, and it&rsquo;s unclear if it would ever will. ChatGPT excels in taking an authoritative tone in answering questions, but its factual accuracy has been sometimes called into question, and it&rsquo;s never quite clear what or who is guiding its responses.</p>



<p>ChatGPT has iterated over time, and the latest <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes&amp;xcust=2-1-1446692-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">December version</a> of the chatbot seems to favor tighter, more concise responses rather than lengthier arguments. Asking the same question twice also generated the same response &mdash; which, too, is typical of a search engine, and not an <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/788422/how-to-get-started-with-ai-art-dall-e-mini-ai-dungeon-and-more.html">AI art service</a> which can use different seeds to produce different, interesting responses. All this could be in preparation for integration into a search engine&hellip;or not. </p>



<p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share/all/united-states-of-america#:~:text=%20%20%20Search%20Engines%20%20%20Percentage,%203.02%20%25%20%204%20more%20rows%20&amp;xcust=2-1-1446692-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">According to StatCounter</a>, however, Google has about 88 percent of the U.S. search engine market. Bing has just under 7 percent. Microsoft has already integrated AI art into the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1419066/microsoft-designer-is-almost-a-masterpiece-already.html">gorgeous Microsoft Designer app</a>. Turning Microsoft&rsquo;s savvy AI investment into a viable search upgrade seems like the logical next step.</p>

## These new Asus laptops may have the best display you’ve ever seen

<p>Asus has thrown the gauntlet down. OLED displays are regarded as the best display technology you can own. But 120Hz OLEDs? And 120Hz OLEDs with 3D capabilities? At CES, Asus announced new Vivobooks and Zenbooks with radical new displays that promise to be simply gorgeous.</p>



<p>Will Asus combine all three capabilities in one laptop? No, <em>two</em>. The Asus ProArt StudioBook 16 3D OLED (H7604 3D OLED), which will integrate a 16-inch &ldquo;3.2K&rdquo; 120Hz 3D OLED display as well as a host of other features. But it will <em>also</em> appear in the Asus Vivobook Pro 16X 3D OLED, a much more affordable and mainstream option. </p>



<p>In fact, virtually all of the laptops Asus will ship in 2023 will include an OLED display of some sort.</p>



<p>OLED technology is typically found on high-end TVs for dramatically improved visual quality. Budget TVs (and laptops) use an LED backlight, which lights up the entirety of the display, even when the display is supposed to be &ldquo;black,&rdquo; either during night scenes or just displaying a black background. OLEDs manage light at a per-pixel level, so when a pixel is supposed to be rendering a pitch-black scene, it can simply turn off entirely. That might not be that important during office work, but for creatives and for entertainment purposes, it matters.</p>



<p>The new 3D effects are enabled by a microscopic layer of lenticular lenses that are combined with an eye-tracking webcam mounted inside the laptop, Asus executives explained. 3D scenes are composed on the fly and matched to your position in front of the laptop. </p>



<p>&ldquo;Thanks to OLED displays, extremely low pixel transition times, and massive contrast, crosstalk between the left and the right eye image are reduced to minimum resulting in a surprisingly lifelike precise high contrast, color accurate, high refresh rate, 3D volumetric representation of any 3D objects,&rdquo; said Sascha Krohn, the director of technical marketing for Asus, in a briefing with reporters. &ldquo;The benefits of being able to instantly visualize 3D objects are helpful in a variety of scenarios from 3D content creation mechanical engineering, movies, games, and combining multiple 3d assets in what many now call the metaverse.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit like putting on a VR or AR headset but without putting on anything,&rdquo; Krohn added.</p>



<p>Asus is also adding a second-generation antimicrobial display to some of its laptops. The new Antimicrobial Guard Plus goes a bit further than the first-generation silver-ion coating Asus applied to a few of its 2022 laptops, which helped inhibit the growth of bacteria. The new coating is ISO 21702 and ISO 22196 tested, which inhibits the growth of flu, viruses, and bacteria. Asus tested the new coating against COVID, e.Coli, and staphylococcus (the source of staph infections).</p>



<p>Certain laptops will also ship with what Asus calls a Plasma Ceramization Coating (P.E.O.), which essentially adds a matte coating to what would normally be a shiny-smooth aluminum exterior.</p>



<p>Asus isn&rsquo;t revealing exactly when these new laptops will ship, or what their prices will be. But we do know some of their features, at least.</p>



<p><strong>Asus Zenbook Pro 16X OLED (UX7602): </strong></p>



<p>CES will mark the launch of (currently unannounced) new Nvidia mobile GPUs and new Intel mobile Core chips, and the new Asus Zenbook Pro 16X OLED will feature both. Most of Acer&rsquo;s Zenbook lineup for 2023 will actually be 14-inch laptops, but the Zenbook Pro 16X will include the massive 3.2K 120Hz (16-inch, 16:10) HDR OLED display with 500 nits of light output. An adaptive RGB color sensor will tailor the display to the output that the laptop &ldquo;sees&rdquo;.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-jetpack-image-compare"><div class="juxtapose"><img alt="Asus Zenbook Pro 16X OLED" class="image-compare__image-before" height="1080" id="1441743" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Zenbook-Pro-16X-OLED_UX7602_One-Pager.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1920" /><img alt="Asus Zenbook Pro 16X OLED" class="image-compare__image-after" height="3314" id="1441744" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Zenbook-Pro-16X-OLED_UX7602_Product-photo_07_NumberPad_Light-ps-crop.png" width="4760" /></div><figcaption>The Asus Zenbook Pro 16X OLED.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The entire chassis will be built around a CNC milled unibody design, just 16.9mm thin. Inside will be up to 32GB of LPDDR5X DRAM, up to a whopping 2TB of PCI 4.0 SSD storage (across four ports), and a 96Wh battery. You&rsquo;ll see four Thunderbolt 4 ports, a full HD IR camera, and the Asus haptic number pad that&rsquo;s now 84 percent larger, Asus said. The keyboard will use per-key RGB lighting. A pen will also be available, with up to 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity.</p>



<p>According to Krohn, Asus worked closely with Intel to create a custom &ldquo;Supernova&rdquo; CPU package that houses the CPU and the associated LPDDR5 DRAM on the same interposer, optimizing the power and ground connections to the motherboard and allowing Asus to push performance to 155W within the chassis. </p>



<p>The Asus 14-inch Zenbook lineup will also include the Zenbook Pro 14 Duo OLED (UX8402), an updated version of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394995/asus-zenbook-pro-duo-15-oled-ux582-review-a-3-000-laptop-like-no-other.html">Duo 15 OLED UX582</a>, an Editors&rsquo; Choice-award winning laptop, with the latest CPU and GPU hardware. It will also include the Zenbook Pro 14 OLED (UX6404) and the ZenBook 14X OLED (UX3404). The latter&rsquo;s viewing space has improved over the prior generation (14.5-inch vs 14-inch), and includes a 120Hz OLED panel and a new RTX 3050 GPU option.</p>



<p>The Asus Zenbook Pro 16X OLED (UX7602BZ) will be available in the second quarter for an undisclosed price.</p>



<p><strong>Asus Vivobook Pro 16X (K6604):</strong></p>



<p>The new Vivobook, however, does it one better. Building on the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/697179/asus-vivobook-pro-16x-oled-review-a-practical-creator-laptop-with-a-brilliant-display.html">VivoBook Pro 16X OLED that PCWorld reviewed</a> earlier this year, the new Vivobook Pro 16X includes the option of either a 3.2K (3,200 x 2,000) 3D OLED display at 120Hz or a simpler (and presumably cheaper) 2.5K 165Hz panel instead. Both offer 100 percent DCI-P3 color gamut coverage. Asus is boasting 88.6 percent screen-to-body ratio along with a chassis that&rsquo;s 21.9mm thick and weighs a somewhat chunky 4.2 pounds. The keyboard will be coated with the Antimicrobial Guard Plus coating, which will be ergonomically designed.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-jetpack-image-compare"><div class="juxtapose"><img alt="Asus Vivobook Pro 16 3D OLED" class="image-compare__image-before" height="720" id="1441742" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Vivobook-Pro-16X-OLED_One-Pager.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1280" /><img alt="Asus Vivobook Pro 16 3D OLED" class="image-compare__image-after" height="6016" id="1441745" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Vivobook-Pro_K66043D_07_Silver-1-ps-crop.png" width="8044" /></div><figcaption>The Asus Vivobook Pro 16X.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Asus isn&rsquo;t disclosing the CPU inside of the new Vivobook Pro 16X, but it will presumably be Intel&rsquo;s next-gen mobile chip, along with the next-gen Nvidia mobile GPU. Asus will build in its IceCoolPro thermal-management technology, presumably adding to the weight along the 90Wh battery. Up to 64GB DDR5 and 2TB of SSD storage will be included.</p>



<p>The 3D webcam will be rated at 1080p quality. This laptop will also include the Asus Dialpad, with a dial that will control the volume by default. Asus also says that the laptop includes a smart amplifier, which will be 3.5 times louder than usual.</p>



<p>The Asus Vivobook Pro 16X 3D OLED (K6604) will be available in the second quarter, Asus said.</p>



<p><strong>Asus ProArt Studiobook 16 3D OLED:</strong></p>



<p>The third flagship laptop from Asus will likely carry a premium price, as well. Again, the focus is on the display: a 16-inch 3.2K (3,200x 2,000)120Hz OLED panel with 3D capabilities and a 100-percent DCI-P3 color coverage. Here, Asus will use the ultra-high-end Core-HX platform from Intel, presumably its upcoming mobile processor, along with the latest Nvidia RTX hardware. Asus claims that the laptop can be driven with up to 150W of power, helped by &ldquo;liquid metal&rdquo; cooling and a quad-vent exhaust system. There&rsquo;s a 90Wh battery inside.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-jetpack-image-compare"><div class="juxtapose"><img alt="Asus ProArt StudioBook 16 3D OLED" class="image-compare__image-before" height="720" id="1441741" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/H7604-3D_One-Pager.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1280" /><img alt="Asus ProArt StudioBook 16 3D OLED" class="image-compare__image-after" height="6436" id="1441747" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ProArt-Studiobook-16-3D-OLED_H7604_Product-photo_2B_Mineral-Black_08-pscrop.png" width="9412" /></div><figcaption>The Asus ProArt Studiobook 16 3D OLED.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Here, the ports will shine: in addition to the pair of Thunderbolt 4 ports, Asus is claiming to be one of the first to offer SD Express 7.0 card support with 985MB/s speeds. HDMI 2.1 ports also appear.</p>



<p>There&rsquo;s more: Asus claims that the touchpad will be the first haptic touchpad, <em>and</em> offer stylus support for drawing. The Asus Dial can be either used to control volume or paired with the Asus ProArt Creator Hub utility as a launcher for popular apps.</p>



<p>The Asus ProArt Studiobook 16 3D OLED (H7604) will ship in the second quarter at an undisclosed price.</p>

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>After first being <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/704823/the-new-asus-500hz-gaming-monitor-is-the-worlds-fastest.html">teased at Computex</a> only to never appear in 2022, face-melting 500Hz monitors are actually a thing at CES 2023. As a self-confirmed sweaty tryhard, I am extremely here for it.</p>



<p>Competitive esports gamers adore faster GPU frame rates and faster monitor refresh rates because cranking those up can dramatically increase responsiveness. (There&rsquo;s a reason esports pros dial graphics settings back to Low even if it&rsquo;s ugly.) Until now, competitive monitors topped out at roughly 360Hz&mdash;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393646/tested-how-nvidia-reflex-can-make-you-a-better-esports-gamer.html">already a sublimely smooth experience</a>. But at CES 2023, the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://rog.asus.com/articles/gaming-monitors/rog-swift-pro-pg248qp-intro/&amp;xcust=2-1-1446541-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Asus ROG Swift Pro PG248QP</a> and aptly named <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/alienware-unleashes-worlds-fastest-refresh-rate-of-500hz-on-a-fast-ips-gaming-monitor-and-bolsters-aurora-r15-desktop-at-ces-2023-301709716.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1446541-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Alienware 500Hz Gaming Monitor (AW2524H)</a> finally broke the 500Hz barrier. Better yet, both of these 24.5-inch, 1080p displays include Nvidia&rsquo;s fantastic G-Sync and Reflex technologies for even more smoothness. <em>Yes</em>.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="500Hz monitor" class="wp-image-1446546" height="647" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/alienware-500hz.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Alienware</p></div>



<p>Some people swear that you can&rsquo;t feel a difference over 60Hz, but that&rsquo;s not true. I&rsquo;ve had a chance to speak with Nvidia&rsquo;s esports and display engineers about the topic in the past and they explained that to truly feel a monitor upgrade, you need to double the refresh rate. That&rsquo;s why upgrading from a 60Hz screen to a 120Hz display feels great in esports, while going from 120Hz to 144Hz feels the same. It&rsquo;s also why my 360Hz gaming monitor felt <em>so damned buttery smooth</em> moving from 144Hz. Like, incredibly, deliciously smooth.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, these drool-inducing new monitors probably won&rsquo;t mean much to <em>me</em> since 500Hz doesn&rsquo;t double up 360Hz, but it should make a difference to most gamers. If you&rsquo;re playing on a 144Hz or even a 240Hz display and want to unlock a totally new mind-blowing level of smoothness, these debut 500Hz G-Sync monitors should absolutely do the trick.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>If you&rsquo;re willing to blow obscene amounts of money on a monitor to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1439495/shipment-makes-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2s-worst-parts-fun.html">roll folks in <em>Call of Duty</em></a>, that is. Alienware hasn&rsquo;t announced pricing yet, but Asus told the Verge that the ROG Swift Pro PG24QP should cost $900. The Alienware will launch sometime this quarter while the ROG display hits the streets this spring.

<p><em>Editor&rsquo;s note: This article was amended on December 20, 2022 to reflect changes in pricing and options.</em></p>



<p>As of our latest look, iDrive remains the most comprehensive online backup and sharing service we&rsquo;ve tested. It&rsquo;s not the cheapest, but it&rsquo;s still affordable and comes with backup clients for nearly every PC and device, and is more than competent at local backup.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company also provides additional storage for syncing all your devices and PCs, allows sharing of files with anyone, and has the ability to back up to a local drive. See how well it compares to the competition in our big <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3211435/online-backup-we-test-the-best-services-from-backblaze-to-carbonite-mozy-and-more">online backup roundup</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Note: For more about data backup, see our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3235812/the-best-free-backup-software-and-services.html">best free backup software/services</a> and the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3201971/best-windows-backup-software.html">best Windows backup software&nbsp;</a>roundups.</em></p><p></p></blockquote>



<p></p>



<h2 id="idrive-plans-and-pricing">iDrive: Plans and pricing</h2>



<p>Believe it or not, iDrive still offers a free storage plan, which has increased from 5GB to 10GB since our last look at the service. As far as we&rsquo;re aware, it&rsquo;s the only free repository not associated with a mega corporation (Microsoft, Apple, Google, etc.) still in existence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>iDrive has three Personal plans that cover one user with unlimited computers and devices: a 5TB plan for $59.62 the first year (or $119.25 for two years), and $79.50 each year after; a 10TB plan for $74.62 the first year (or $149.25 for two years) and $99.50 each year after; as well as a 20TB plan that&rsquo;s $149.62 for the first year (299.25 for two years) and $199.50 after that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you enable the separate sync service, you get an equal amount of storage just for that task&mdash;no extra charge.</p>



<p>There&rsquo;s a new Team plan that scales from five users and computers for $99.50 per year to 500 users and computers for $19,999.50, all offering 1TB of storage per user. Those were also discounted at the same rate as the Personal plans at the time of this writing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Don&rsquo;t get completely caught up in the price-per-gigabyte game: The size of your essential data is probably a lot smaller than what&rsquo;s being offered by iDrive, unless you&rsquo;re into HDR and 4K.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="iDrive plans" class="wp-image-1441685" height="638" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/idrive.png" width="833" /><figcaption><p>iDrive plans as of December 2022.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">iDrive</p></div>



<h2 id="idrive-features">iDrive: Features</h2>



<p>Like its competitor <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3220525/carbonite-review-cleverly-integrated-online-backup.html">Carbonite Safe</a>, iDrive uses continuous data protection (CDP) rather than backing up on a set schedule. If you have a rapidly changing data set, it&rsquo;s nice to have files backed up as they change, not just periodically. iDrive also supports nearly every type of PC and device: Windows, OS X, Android, iOS, and various NAS boxes. Also nice are the snapshots, which make it easy to restore your PC to a particular point in time.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/04/idrive-2-100883527-orig.jpg"><img alt="idrive 2" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/04/idrive-2-100883527-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption>iDrive&rsquo;s online dashboard offers all the settings that the client offers. Including enabling/disabling continuous data protection (near real-time backup of changed files).</figcaption></figure></div>




<p>iDrive now features two local clients. The normal one allows access to all the options, and is nearly identical to iDrive&rsquo;s online dashboard. The other, iDrive Basic, is for those who just want to push a button and back up everything (assuming your plan has the space.)</p>



<p>iDrive will also handily duplicate your online backup to local storage. That allows you to painlessly maintain the Rule of Three: your original data, a copy, and a copy of the copy. Also, it&rsquo;s much faster to restore from a hard drive than from any online service.</p>



<p>iDrive also features iDrive Express, a two-way physical shipment service. Say you&rsquo;re walled off from the internet, or just in a very low-bandwidth location. Use iDrive&rsquo;s local backup function to back up your data to a storage device provided by the company, then ship it to them. It will get uploaded to your online account, and then updated by your local client thereafter. Or if you need to restore from a backup in hurry, iDrive will ship your data to you on an appropriate device. All within a week&rsquo;s time.</p>



<p>Personal customers get 3TB of data delivered to or fro for free&mdash;the first time. Team and Business users get three free deliveries. Subsequently, there&rsquo;s a $60 charge per use.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="should-you-use-idrives-backup-service">Should you use iDrive&rsquo;s backup service?</h2>



<p>iDrive offers the most comprehensive set of backup and backup-related features of any online service we&rsquo;ve tested, plus one of the simplest clients we&rsquo;ve seen for those who just want to back up with a minimum of fuss. That all the advanced features are available at the basic service level, makes iDrive less expensive than it might seem at first glance. Good stuff from a now venerable company in the online backup field.</p>



<p><em><strong>Editor&rsquo;s note:</strong> Because online services are often iterative, gaining new features and performance improvements over time, this review is subject to change in order to accurately reflect the current state of the service. Any changes to text or our final review verdict will be noted at the top of this article.</em></p>

<p>If you work at a desk job, you probably spend long stretches of time sitting down. Well, Acer wants to get you moving with the new eKinekt BD 3 Bike Desk. The bike turns the kinetic energy from pedaling into electric energy for charging your devices. As a remote worker that likes to stay active throughout the day, I find this bike to be both interesting and thrilling. Let&rsquo;s jump right into the details then,.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer kinetic bike" class="wp-image-1445806" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/eKinekt-BD-3-Lifestyle-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Acer</p></div>



<p>The bike/desk features two USB Type-A ports and one USB Type-C port, which allows you to charge multiple devices at once. The LCD display and companion app track information such as calories burned, workout duration, and so on. According to Acer, if you pedal for one hour at 60 RPM, the bike will generate 75 watts of power. This energy can then be used to charge laptops and other electronic devices. The bike also comes with a bag hook and a beverage holder. </p>



<p>Need to prioritize your work over exercising? No problem. This bike has two modes: Working Mode and Sports Mode. In Working Mode, the desk moves closer to the chair, allowing you to work in a more upright position. In Sports Mode, the desk moves away from you and gives you more room to lean in, like the way you&rsquo;d normally sit on a traditional bike. This means you can intensify your workout during lunch or downtime. </p>



<p>The eKinekt BD 3 Bike Desk will cost $999 and become available in June. </p>

## AMD confirms Radeon RX 7900 XTX overheating: What you need to know

<p>AMD&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1431755/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-radeon-rx-7900-xt-review-rdna-3.html">Radeon RX 7900 XTX</a> launched in mid-December offering a huge performance upgrade over its predecessor and more performance than Nvidia&rsquo;s pricier RTX 4080. But it&rsquo;s not all roses. Over the holiday break, a worrying number of users reported excessively high hot spot temperatures, hitting a whopping 110 degrees Celsius and slowing their GPU&rsquo;s performance. </p>



<p>After first stating that those are normal operating temperatures, AMD is now doing an about-face, admitting that at least some 7900 XTX reference cards suffered from a manufacturing defect that affects performance. Here&rsquo;s what the company told <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.hardwareluxx.de/index.php/news/hardware/grafikkarten/60063-hohes-temperatur-delta-nutzer-melden-temperaturprobleme-der-radeon-rx-7900-xt-x.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1446335-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Hardware Luxx&rsquo;s Andreas Schilling</a>, who has been investigating the issue:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&ldquo;We are working to determine the cause of the unexpected performance limitation of AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX graphics cards. Based on our observations to date we believe the issue is related to the thermal solution used in AMD&rsquo;s reference design and is occurring in a limited number of cards sold. We are working to resolve this issue for the affected cards. Customers experiencing this unexpected limitation should contact&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amd.com/en/support/contact-call&amp;xcust=2-1-1446335-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">AMD support</a>.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>



<p>Here&rsquo;s what you need to know about overheating Radeon RX 7900 XTX GPUs.</p>



<h2 id="why-are-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-gpus-overheating">Why are Radeon RX 7900 XTX GPUs overheating?</h2>



<p>We haven&rsquo;t covered this ordeal yet due to the holiday, but in a nutshell: Some Radeon RX 7900 XTX graphics cards are hitting excessively high temperatures. The tech press&mdash;especially German tech press&mdash;have been digging into the issue with noted overclocker Der8auer performing extensive tests on a reader-supplied 7900 XTX known to be affected. He concluded that the issues likely stemmed from an issue with the vapor chamber coolers in the reference models, a conclusion that AMD&rsquo;s &ldquo;issue is related to the thermal solution&rdquo; seems to confirm.</p>



<p>You can see his efforts in the video below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>It&rsquo;s unknown how widespread the problem is. On social media, more Radeon RX 7900 XTX owners than not seem to be having no thermal issues whatsoever, but <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.igorslab.de/en/amd-radeon-rx-7900xtx-reference-cards-mba-and-the-hotspot-multiple-batches-of-vapor-chamber-affected-the-replacement-begins/&amp;xcust=2-1-1446335-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Igor Wallossek&rsquo;s well-connected sources</a> claim it could affect several production batches. Wallossek says thousands of cards may need to be returned, both from DIYers and system builders.</p>



<p>Oof, if true. Those AMD jabs against Nvidia&rsquo;s melting power connectors sure feel awkward now. Fortunately, with AMD now acknowledging the issue, buyers of affected Radeon RX 7900 XTX cards should hopefully be able to have their GPUs replaced or refunded. Fingers crossed.</p>



<h2 id="which-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-gpus-are-affected-by-thermal-issues">Which Radeon RX 7900 XTX GPUs are affected by thermal issues?</h2>



<p>Only the reference-designed Radeon RX 7900 XTX is affected, including reference cards sold by partners like Sapphire, XFX, and so on. The issue is with the vapor chamber in that specific design. Custom Radeon RX 7900 XTX models aren&rsquo;t suffering from the same issues. The reference model for the step-down Radeon RX 7900 XT appear to be fine as well.</p>



<h2 id="how-do-i-know-if-my-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-is-overheating">How do I know if my Radeon RX 7900 XTX is overheating?</h2>



<p>If your card is stuttering or delivering less performance than intended, it&rsquo;s worth checking to see if your Radeon RX 7900 XTX reference card suffers from thermal defect issues. AMD&rsquo;s Radeon Overlay can help. Enable the &ldquo;GPU junction temperature&rdquo; monitoring option using <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/faq/dh3-038&amp;xcust=2-1-1446335-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">this guide</a>, then pull up the overlay and play some games for a bit. If you see it creeping up towards 110 degrees, you&rsquo;ll want to contact AMD using the link at the top of this article. (For reference, our Radeon RX 7900 XTX junction temps maxed out at 84 degrees.)</p>



<p>Be sure you&rsquo;re looking at the <strong>GPU Junction Temperature </strong>and not the standard <strong>GPU temperature</strong>, though. The junction temperature shows the hottest spot on the die. That&rsquo;s where you may see an issue, even if the standard GPU temps look peachy.</p>

It offers stagnant value at best and atrocious value at worst depending on how you look at it. We can&rsquo;t recommend the 4070 Ti unless Nvidia slashes the cost significantly. </p>
</div><h3 class="review-price" id="price-when-reviewed">Price When Reviewed</h3><p>$799</p>


<p>This review will be short and sweet. Nvidia&rsquo;s new $799 GeForce RTX 4070 Ti is a technically hobbled, drastically overpriced graphics card that costs $100 more than the higher-tier RTX 3080 did last generation. In exchange for that 14 percent higher price tag, you usually get 14 percent higher performance at 4K resolution, and around 20 percent at 1440p. </p>



<p>Depending on how you look at it, the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti offers stagnant-at-best value at similar prices to last generation, or a painfully steep mark-up over last-gen&rsquo;s already overpriced RTX 3070 Ti. It&rsquo;s a beastly card that can topple the previous RTX 3090 Ti flagship in many games, especially at 1440p resolution or when DLSS 3 swings into action, but at this chest-clutching price, we simply can&rsquo;t recommend it. In fact, we recommend avoiding it outright unless there are mammoth price reductions. </p>



<h2 id="geforce-rtx-4070-ti-specs-features-and-design">GeForce RTX 4070 Ti: Specs, features, and design</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="GeForce RTX 4070 Ti review" class="wp-image-1445643" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>



<p>The specs for the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti shouldn&rsquo;t surprise anyone, since it&rsquo;s the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1354391/nvidia-cancels-the-controversial-rtx-4080-12gb.html">&ldquo;unlaunched&rdquo; $899 RTX 4080 12GB</a> with a new name. Gamers (<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1071293/6-geforce-rtx-40-series-4090-4080-secrets-nvidia.html">and us</a>) called shenanigans on Nvidia initially giving this scaled-down GPU the same 4080 branding as the much more powerful 16GB RTX 4080, and shortly before AMD revealed its <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1431755/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-radeon-rx-7900-xt-review-rdna-3.html">Radeon RX 7900-series graphics cards</a>&mdash;which would&rsquo;ve made this GPU look silly at the same $899 price as the 7900 XT&mdash;Nvidia canceled its original launch plans. It&rsquo;s back with a lower price tag that&rsquo;s still unreasonably, uncomfortably high for what&rsquo;s being offered.</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s a recap of the RTX 4070 Ti&rsquo;s core specs:</p>

<p>Yes, the 4070 Ti&rsquo;s core count and memory capacity are drastically reduced versus the 4080&mdash;Nvidia made the right call (eventually) with its name change. But now that the name won&rsquo;t sow confusion amongst would-be buyers, the more concerning tweak revolves around the 4070 Ti&rsquo;s memory bus.</p>



<p>Wider bus lanes let you move data more effectively. Think of it like rush hour; a four-lane highway can keep traffic moving much faster than a single-lane dirt road. Bus width is an important factor for overall memory bandwidth, especially at higher resolutions where textures and ray tracing can gobble up memory <em>fast</em>.</p>



<p>The GeForce RTX 4070 Ti packs a pipsqueak 192-bit memory bus. By contrast, the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393472/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-founders-edition-review.html">RTX 3080</a>&mdash;which, again, was a higher-tier card that cost $100 less than the 4070 Ti&mdash;wielded a 320-bit bus, which is typical for a high-end GPU. Even the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394671/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-ti-review.html">already-pandemic-overpriced $600 RTX 3070 Ti</a> had a 256-bit bus. You had to go all the way down to the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394228/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review.html">$330 RTX 3060</a> to find an Nvidia GPU with a 192-bit bus last generation.</p>



<p>The new 4070 Ti offers 504GB/s of total memory bandwidth; the 3080 hit 760GB/s and the 3070 Ti offered 608GB/s, while the 3060 and its far slower GDDR6 non-X memory hit an appropriate 360GB/s.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="GeForce RTX 4070 Ti review" class="wp-image-1445645" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The Asus Tuf RTX 4070 Ti features an attractive backplate with plenty of airflow.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>



<p>It matters. Compared to the RTX 3080, the 4070 Ti&rsquo;s uplift in 4K gaming is measurably slower than its 1440p uplift. You can still play 4K games with everything cranked and still hit 60 frames per second without issue most of the time, but intentionally hobbling the 4K performance of a <em>freaking $799 graphics card</em> leaves a sour taste in the mouth. The 4070 Ti is tangibly slower than all other new-gen GPUs <em>and </em>the RTX 3080 in <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em> at 4K and 1440p resolutions, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if the neutered bus width factors into that. It would be more acceptable if this GPU costs hundreds of dollars less.</p>



<p>Fortunately, the RTX 4070 Ti is much more efficient than the 3080 was, rated for 285 watts of total graphics power compared to the 3080&rsquo;s 320W. It&rsquo;s faster, too. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html">Nvidia&rsquo;s new Ada Lovelace GPU architecture</a> impresses there. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The custom Asus Tuf 4070 Ti we&rsquo;re reviewing today&mdash;Nvidia isn&rsquo;t launching a Founders Edition version of this GPU&mdash;still uses the new 16-pin 12VHPWR connector, however, with an adapter included in the box. (<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1386084/nvidia-finally-responds-to-melting-rtx-4090-cable-controversy.html">Make sure you plug it in snugly</a>.) It&rsquo;s also a huge 3.25-slot graphics card despite the lower power draw. Asus otherwise did a fine job with Tuf, which features a striking industrial design, a dual-BIOS switch (we test at default), and not one, but <em>two </em>HDMI 2.0b connectors to go along with three DisplayPorts. Finding dual HDMI ports on a GPU is rare these days, and Asus only charges a $50 premium for this version of the Tuf&mdash;though, <em>again</em>, the RTX 4070 Ti is wildly overpriced to begin with.</p>

<p>Nvidia maintains its lead in terms of offering well-rounded features and capabilities that AMD simply can&rsquo;t match. The Radeon RX 7900 duo is tangibly faster than the 4070 Ti in terms of raw rasterization (read: traditional gaming) performance, but Nvidia&rsquo;s GPU holds a massive ray tracing performance advantage, bolstered by AI-powered DLSS and DLSS Frame Generation technologies. They&rsquo;re fiercely impressive. Generally speaking, Nvidia also thwomps AMD in CUDA support for machine learning tasks (duh), overall content creation prowess, and with other life-enhancing features like Nvidia Broadcast, Reflex, and Shadowplay. If you do more with your GPU than simply play games, or if you consider peak ray tracing performance a priority, target an Nvidia GPU.</p>



<p>Let&rsquo;s get to the games.</p>



<h2 id="our-test-system">Our test system</h2>



<p>We test graphics cards on an AMD Ryzen 5900X PC used exclusively for benchmarking GPUs. We now test with PCIe Resizable BAR (also known as Smart Access Memory on Ryzen systems) active, as most modern gaming PCs released in the last four years support the performance-boosting feature, either natively or via a motherboard firmware update. Nvidia also recommends turning on the optional &ldquo;Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling&rdquo; option in Windows to let the RTX 40-series stretch its legs to the fullest, so we&rsquo;ve made that tweak as well. Most of the hardware was provided by the manufacturers, but we purchased the storage ourselves.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re comparing Nvidia&rsquo;s $799 GeForce RTX 4070 Ti against all the modern GPUs released by both Nvidia and AMD thus far, as well as last generation&rsquo;s RTX 3080, 3080 Ti, and 3090 and Radeon RX 6900 XT. Time constraints prevented us from benchmarking the $600 GeForce RX 3070 Ti, the 4070 Ti&rsquo;s ostensible predecessor, but given this new card&rsquo;s jacked-up price point the RTX 3080 is a more honest comparison anyway.</p>

<p>In addition to turning on PCIe Resizable BAR by default, we&rsquo;ve also moved to a new set of games in our testing suite for this new generation. We test a variety of games spanning various engines, genres, vendor sponsorships (Nvidia, AMD, and Intel), and graphics APIs (DirectX 9, 11, DX12, and Vulkan), to try to represent a full range of performance potential. Each game is tested using its in-game benchmark, sanity checked by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/frameview/&amp;xcust=2-3-1444726-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Nvidia&rsquo;s FrameView tool</a>, at the highest possible graphics presets unless otherwise noted, with VSync, frame rate caps, real-time ray tracing or DLSS effects, and FreeSync/G-Sync disabled, along with any other vendor-specific technologies like FidelityFX tools or Nvidia Reflex. We&rsquo;ve also enabled temporal anti-aliasing (TAA) to push these cards to their limits.</p>



<p>We run each benchmark at least three times and list the average result for each test. Outside of esports, we&rsquo;ve limited our benchmarks to 4K and 1440p resolutions, as those are the natural fits for these juggernaut GPUs (despite the 4070 Ti&rsquo;s paltry bus width).</p>



<p>We&rsquo;re going to show these benchmarks without individual game commentary. In general, pay attention to how much faster the 4070 Ti is compared to the $100 cheaper 3080, and how the 4070 Ti gains more speed on the 3080 at 1440p than 4K. Also note how the similarly overpriced $899 Radeon RX 7900 XT outperforms the $799 4070 Ti by a significant amount across the board. We didn&rsquo;t have time to fully benchmark the 4070 Ti&rsquo;s ray tracing prowess, but included a chart showing <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>running with RT enabled (with DLSS and FSR both on, and off) to confirm that, yep, Nvidia&rsquo;s GPU architecture continues to blow AMD&rsquo;s ray tracing performance out of the water. It isn&rsquo;t even close.</p>

<h2 id="geforce-rtx-4070-ti-power-and-thermals">GeForce RTX 4070 Ti: Power and thermals</h2>



<p>We test power draw by looping the&nbsp;<em>F1 22</em>&nbsp;benchmark at 4K for about 20 minutes after we&rsquo;ve benchmarked everything else (to warm up the GPU) and noting the highest reading on our Watts Up Pro meter, which measures the power consumption of our entire test system. The initial part of the race, where all competing cars are onscreen simultaneously, tends to be the most demanding portion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This isn&rsquo;t a worst-case test; this is a GPU-bound game running at a GPU-bound resolution to gauge performance when the graphics card is sweating hard. If you&rsquo;re playing a game that also hammers the CPU, you could see higher overall system power draws. Consider yourself warned.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="GeForce RTX 4070 Ti review" class="wp-image-1445636" height="1199" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/power.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1183" width="1183" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>



<p>Despite being faster than the RTX 3080, the 4070 Ti consumes far less power both when idle and under load. Even if Nvidia isn&rsquo;t moving the needle in terms of value with the 4070 Ti, its efficiency is no doubt improving.</p>



<p>We test thermals by leaving GPU-Z open during the&nbsp;<em>F1 22</em>&nbsp;power draw test, noting the highest maximum temperature at the end.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="GeForce RTX 4070 Ti review" class="wp-image-1445632" height="1199" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/temps.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1183" width="1183" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>



<p>The custom Asus Tuf cooling design delivers absolutely frigid temperatures under full load. Overclockers could have a field day with this particular model. You hear some fan noise to achieve those impressive temperatures, but it isn&rsquo;t overly loud or annoying. I have no complaints about the Asus Tuf&rsquo;s overall thermal design.</p>



<h2 id="should-you-buy-the-geforce-rtx-4070-ti">Should you buy the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti?</h2>



<p>Please don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s a beast of a card that shows what Nvidia&rsquo;s stellar hardware and software engineers are capable of&mdash;but not that this eye-watering price.</p>



<p>In a vacuum, the $799 GeForce RTX 4070 Ti&rsquo;s rasterization performance underwhelms compared to the $899 Radeon RX 7900 XT except in ray tracing performance, but Nvidia&rsquo;s abundant software and feature offerings&mdash;Studio drivers, DLSS and Frame Generation, Broadcast, Reflex, CUDA, <em>et cetera</em>&mdash;can make that gap easier to swallow if you use your GPU for more than just gaming. In reality, the RTX 4070 Ti&mdash;like the RTX 4080 and Radeon 7900 XT before it&mdash;carry price tags that make their value stagnant at best and borderline insulting at worst.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="GeForce RTX 4070 Ti review" class="wp-image-1445644" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>



<p>At $799, the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti costs $100 more than last generation&rsquo;s stunning RTX 3080&mdash;<em>and</em> it&rsquo;s a lower-tier GPU. It&rsquo;s $200 more than the already-overpriced RTX 3070 Ti was. In exchange for that 14 percent price hike over the 3080, you usually get a stagnant 14 percent more performance than the 3080 at 4K, or roughly 20 percent faster speeds at 1440p. Nvidia cut the 4070 Ti&rsquo;s memory bus back to RTX 3060 levels which slows it down at 4K. That&rsquo;s flat-out unacceptable in a <em>$799 graphics card</em>.</p>



<p>Gamers are in a bad place. Nvidia and AMD&rsquo;s flagships, the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html">GeForce RTX 4090</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1431755/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-radeon-rx-7900-xt-review-rdna-3.html">Radeon RX 7900 XTX</a>, offer stunning performance gains over their predecessors for similar prices. But everything under those carry downright painful MSRPs compared to prior generations. Nvidia and AMD must still think we&rsquo;re in the midst of a pandemic with roaring cryptocurrency value. We&rsquo;re not. Miners were the ones buying graphics cards for painful, outrageous prices, not gamers. These graphics card costs are ludicrous.</p>



<p>Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX 4080 costs <em>$500 more</em> than the 3080 did. Gross. Rather than seizing the moment, AMD priced its feature-lacking Radeon RX 7900 XT at $899, when spec-wise it probably should&rsquo;ve been called the Radeon RX 7800 XT and priced a couple hundred dollars lower. But AMD&rsquo;s thirst for 7900 XT profit margins also allowed Nvidia to reintroduce the &ldquo;unlaunched&rdquo; disastrous RTX 4080 12GB with a new name and a price tag just $100 less than before. It&rsquo;s still extremely unappealing. You shouldn&rsquo;t have to pay <em>$800 dollars</em> for what&rsquo;s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/geforce-rtx-4070-ti/&amp;xcust=2-3-1444726-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">being actively marketed</a> as a 1440p graphics card in 2023, <em>especially</em> with its 4K performance being hobbled by the subpar memory bus.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Bah. It&rsquo;s like WOPR said in <em>WarGames</em>: &ldquo;A strange game. The only winning move is not to play.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Part of the reason why Nvidia and AMD are keeping prices so high is to move their stockpiled last-gen GPUs now that cryptocurrency has crashed, at carefully managed high prices. Nvidia in particular keeps trying to show the RTX 40-series as expensive options on <em>top </em>of the 30-series lineup, rather than the generational replacement it truly is&mdash;a worryingly anti-consumer business decision. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/826475/6-things-consider-buying-used-graphics-card.html">Buy a used graphics card instead</a> if you aren&rsquo;t going all-in on a 4090 or a 7900 XTX. You can find similarly performing GPUs like the Radeon RX 6800 XT and 6900 XT or the RX 3080 for hundreds of dollars less than Nvidia and AMD are charging for these wildly overpriced new offerings. We have <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/826475/6-things-consider-buying-used-graphics-card.html">tips to help you avoid buying a used lemon</a>.</p>



<p>And I&rsquo;m saying that despite being a guy who <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398069/should-you-buy-a-used-graphics-card.html">typically recommends that you avoid used graphics cards</a>.</p>



<p>Because paying <strong>$800</strong> for a hobbled, drastically overpriced 1440p-focused graphics card in 2023 ain&rsquo;t it. The launch of this new generation largely mirrors the RTX 20-series launch, where stagnant gen-on-gen value led to terrible sales and the introduction of an RTX 20 Super series shortly after to help kickstart matters&hellip;though that launch coincided with the release of AMD&rsquo;s excellent, sanely priced Radeon RX 5000-series. This generation, AMD seems content to ride the coattails of Nvidia&rsquo;s excessive pricing. Flagship GPUs shouldn&rsquo;t offer the best price-per-dollar value, and the rest of your stack shouldn&rsquo;t deliver performance that scales almost linearly with the pricing of last-gen models.</p>



<p>Discrete graphics cards sales just <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.tomshardware.com/news/sales-of-desktop-graphics-cards-hit-20-year-low&amp;xcust=2-3-1444726-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">hit a 20-year low</a>. Unless something drastic changes, like a modern introduction of Super series equivalents, releases like the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti and 4080 will likely only exacerbate the pain.</p>



<p>Not just pass, but hard pass. If you must buy a next-gen GPU around this price point, the Radeon RX 7900 XT is also atrociously priced but it&rsquo;s noticeably faster and comes with 20GB of memory, 8GB more than the 4070 Ti. If you need Nvidia features and must buy a 4070 Ti, I highly recommend the Asus Tuf model.</p>



<p>But we&rsquo;re in the midst of a strange game. Please don&rsquo;t buy either. Not at these prices.</p>

## Plugable telegraphs Thunderbolt’s future with a crazy new 4K dock

<p>Plugable&rsquo;s new 16-in-1 Thunderbolt 4 Quad Dock (TBT4-UDZ) doesn&rsquo;t support the upcoming next-gen Thunderbolt 5 spec. But at CES 2023, the company is very clearly signaling that it will with its new specifications.</p>



<p>The features of the TBT4-UDZ include support for four 4K displays, which is both ludicrous and quite likely not even possible with the current 40Gbps Thunderbolt 4 specification. After all, just two 4K displays can consume about thirty gigabits per second, plus a little more depending on the refresh rate and complexity of the image. So it&rsquo;s unlikely that this dock can power four 4K displays simultaneously, especially as it&rsquo;s built upon the Intel &ldquo;Goshen Ridge&rdquo; chipset, which allows just 40Gbps per second.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1356812/next-generation-thunderbolt-will-hit-80gbps-too.html">next-gen Thunderbolt specification</a>, however (likely to be called Thunderbolt 5) will support up to 80Gbps. That will easily allow four 4K displays, or (gulp) a 4K display running at 240Hz, or some additional combination of high resolution and high refresh rates. It&rsquo;s just not here yet, though we&rsquo;ll likely see it in 2023.</p>



<p>Otherwise, the TBT4-UDZ (Plugable&rsquo;s first official Thunderbolt 4 dock) includes some of the features we&rsquo;ve come to expect in our list of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393714/best-thunderbolt-docks-for-a-laptop-pc.html">best Thunderbolt docks</a>: a choice between HDMI and DisplayPort connections &mdash; or the ability to use both &mdash; along with 100W charging power. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/814540/plugable-tbt3-udz-thunderbolt-dock-review.html">The TBT4-UDZ is a cousin of the TBT3-UDZ, one of our Editors&rsquo; Choice-winning docks</a>. Plugable is among the manufacturers officially supporting 2.5Gbps Ethernet too, although the more bandwidth coming down the cable, the more congested that cable can be. You&rsquo;ll find four USB-A ports (two 5Gbps, two 10Gbps) and a UHS-II microSD/SD card slot.</p>



<p>The TBT4-UDZ will be released on Jan. 17 on Amazon for $299.</p>

<p>HyperX, HP&rsquo;s gaming peripherals team, announced the HX3D program ahead of CES. In a nutshell, this program is set to produce 3D-printed custom upgrades for gaming peripherals like keyboards and headsets. According to HP, the company will showcase these personalized keyboards, headsets, and mice at CES. The upgrades will become available to buyers in the coming months. HyperX also intends to collaborate with esports teams, influencers, game developers, and so on. Sounds pretty cool, right?</p>

<p>Basically, HyperX wants to dress up your gaming gear. From colorful keycaps to unique collectibles, the video above illustrates the kind of 3D-printed upgrades you can expect from the HX3D program. I could definitely see Twitch streamers decking out their gear for live streams. My husband digs this sort of thing too, as he regularly 3D prints parts for his Warhammer 40K collection. Is it cool? Absolutely. Is it necessary? Well, that&rsquo;s up for debate. I enjoy stuff like this, but I&rsquo;m probably in the minority here. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about you, but adorable keycaps make me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. While some folks may balk and say they&rsquo;re pointless or they&rsquo;re all fluff and no substance, I find myself often enjoying the little pleasures in life, and HyperX&rsquo;s limited edition Cozy Cat keycap is, quite literally, a little pleasure. The Cozy Cat keycap (pictured above), which was designed by the HyperX team, will be the first 3D-printed peripheral upgrade to emerge from the HX3D program and it&rsquo;s positively wonderful. </p>



<p>The Cozy Cat keycap will become available in January 2023. It&rsquo;ll cost a lofty $19.99.</p>

<p>Do you have a bad back? Well, I&rsquo;ve got difficult news&mdash; the future of tech no longer belongs to the thinnest, smallest PCs. On the contrary, laptop makers came to CES 2023 with thick rosters packed to bursting with 14-inch, 16-inch, and even 18-inch laptops.</p>



<p>This, for better or worse, is the new reality of laptop PCs. It&rsquo;s not great for posture, but good news for performance (and, perhaps, your eyes).</p>



<h2 id="meet-the-backbreakers">Meet the backbreakers</h2>



<p>It&rsquo;s a bit bizarre to watch PC laptops make an abrupt 180 and flee back towards girthy designs. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/473483/laptops_at_ces_2012_thinner_lighter_and_more_luxurious.html">Exactly 10 years ago, at CES 2012</a>, Intel responded to Apple&rsquo;s obsessively thin MacBook Air by going all-in on thin design for the Ultrabook concept. Many of today&rsquo;s most popular PC laptop sub-brands, including Dell&rsquo;s XPS and Asus&rsquo; Zenbook, originated in this swerve towards slim.</p>



<p>But those days are over. Modern high-performance CPU and GPU designs are once again demanding more power, not less, with each new generation. Increased competition between AMD, Intel, Nvidia, Apple, and Qualcomm (among others) has sent laptop core counts soaring well into the double digits. Laptop makers have had no choice but to build for larger, hotter hardware.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Predator Helios 18" class="wp-image-1445454" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/acer-predator-helios-18-two-views.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Acer</p></div>



<p>Take Acer&rsquo;s Predator Helios 18 as an example. This huge laptop offers one of four 18-inch display options: three IPS LCD variants, each weighing 6.97 pounds, and a top-tier Mini-LED monster that tips the scales at 7.17 pounds. All versions are over an inch thick, nearly 16 inches wide, and almost 13 inches deep.</p>



<p>This is what folks in the biz call &ldquo;an absolute unit,&rdquo; and Acer isn&rsquo;t alone. Asus and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444617/dells-new-gaming-laptops-offer-super-sized-screens-and-trendy-colors.html">Alienware</a>, among others, have also shown or teased bigger flagships, and Razer is rumored to have one as well. So, let&rsquo;s be clear: these <em>are</em> flagships, not gimmicks.</p>



<p>17-inch gaming laptops? Hah! That&rsquo;s so 2022.</p>



<h2 id="the-performance-justifies-the-size">The performance justifies the size</h2>



<p>The increasing size of flagship laptops isn&rsquo;t all bad. As mentioned, laptop CPU core counts are now in the double digits as often as not, while laptop GPUs have quickly adopted the latest features (like Nvidia&rsquo;s DLSS). That&rsquo;s good news for performance, especially in the apps that need it the most.</p>



<p>A typical laptop with an Intel Core i7-9750H, common to high-performance laptops sold through 2020, scored around 1,100 to 1,200 in the Cinebench R15 multi-core benchmark. New laptops with Intel Core i7-12700H processors,<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1372718/lenovo-legion-5i-review-cranks-nvidias-rtx-3060-up-to-11.html"> such as the Lenovo Legion 5i</a>, usually score 2,400 to 2,600 in that same test.</p>



<p>Today&rsquo;s laptops might seem designed with Godzilla as the target demographic, but they also outperform in absolute terms, achieving up to twice the performance (and sometimes more) as the best laptop sold a few years ago. And the Core i7-12700H, remember, is old news: the armada of dreadnoughts due to hit stores in 2023 will have<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1435904/intel-launches-13th-gen-mobile-core-chips-with-endurance-gaming.html"> Intel Core 13<sup>th</sup>-gen</a> and AMD Ryzen 7000-series processors.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Nvidia DLSS" class="wp-image-1445450" height="603" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/nvidia-dlss-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Nvidia</p></div>



<p>Gains in graphics performance aren&rsquo;t as impressive, but still improved. Ray tracing was widely available in Nvidia hardware a couple years ago, but most games with support were only enjoyable on top-tier gaming laptops with RTX 2080. Performance is still an issue today, but <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1445469/nvidia-unleashes-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-rtx-40-series-laptops-and-more.html">Nvidia&rsquo;s new RTX 40-series is far more capable</a> of presenting the feature alongside playable framerates, especially when Nvidia DLSS 2 or DLSS 3 are in use.</p>



<p>And these benefits are trickling down to mid-range price points. Even 2023&rsquo;s budget laptops, like the Acer Aspire 5 (soon available with Intel Core 13<sup>th</sup>-gen processors, starting at $549.99 in March), are workhorses that can handle the bulk of tasks anyone would throw at them. They can be used start a YouTube channel, code a breakout app, or manage every aspect of a business start-up. Even competent 1080p gaming is within reach with an upgrade to optional Nvidia RTX 2050 GPU.</p>



<h2 id="when-it-comes-to-displays-bigger-is-better">When it comes to displays, bigger is better</h2>



<p>A larger laptop isn&rsquo;t much fun to haul around an airport, but let&rsquo;s face facts: most people aren&rsquo;t traveling most of the time. Laptops are often used at home, on a desk or a couch, with only brief trips to a classroom, coffee shop, or conference center. These short jaunts make heft less of an issue and let owners enjoy a key benefit: bigger, better displays.</p>



<p>Move aside, 13-inch laptops: the 14-inch screens are finally ascending to their rightful throne. 15 inches? That&rsquo;s nice, I guess, but why settle for that when you can have 16? And, as mentioned, the biggest, baddest portable powerhouses rock 18-inch screens. Whip that thing out at your local Starbucks and, well, you&rsquo;re making a statement.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Legion 5i display" class="wp-image-1373876" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/lenovo-legion-5i-1-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>All joking aside (or was I even joking?), a bigger screen is better. It provides more useful display in productivity apps and more immersion in games and movies. It may even lead to less eye strain, as you&rsquo;ll have space to use larger font sizes in apps, or Windows itself. You won&rsquo;t find these simple, mundane perks on a press release, but they make a laptop more comfortable to use.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/436674/the-best-pc-laptops-of-the-year.html">The best laptops</a> are taking this a step further with upgrades to display resolution. 1080p is still the standard for budget laptops, but almost every laptop sold above $1,000 has pushed that aside in favor of 1440p and 4K, as well as some odd resolutions in between. They&rsquo;ve also transitioned from the 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio to the slightly taller 16:10 ratio, which is now the de-facto standard for many portable PCs. &nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>CES 2023&rsquo;s push towards plus-sized laptop is not a fad. The realities of modern computer hardware, and intense competition between the big-name chipmakers, guarantee that flagship laptops will stay big.&nbsp;So, buy a bigger backpack, check your posture, and enjoy the larger screen. Hefty laptops are here to stay.</p>
