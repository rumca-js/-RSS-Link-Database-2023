It's like a free stand-up show every day. Just don't think too hard about how this is the Leader of the Free World who's also in possession of the nuclear codes, or else you'll spiral into a deep depression from which you may never return. Small details aside, it's hilarious!</p><p>Earlier today, totally mentally competent President Biden visited a dilapidated bridge in Kentucky alongside Republican Senator Mitch McConnell to highlight his infrastructure accomplishments. His administration has allotted nearly $1 trillion for roads and bridges, broadband networks, and water projects in a plan spearheaded by Transportation Secretary <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/pete-buttigieg-tax-credit" target="_blank">Pete Buttigieg</a>. </p><p>While speaking in Kentucky, Biden referenced a  "phrase from his old neighborhood" about patches on jeans:</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cBiden: "I\u2019ll paraphrase the phrase of my old neighborhood: The rest of the countries, the world is not a patch in our jeans, if we do what we wanna do, we need to do."\u201d</div> — Greg Price (@Greg Price)

</blockquote>
<p>Such a beautiful and inspiring statement from ol' Scranton Joe.</p><p>At another point during his speech, Biden randomly began yelling about the recession "two years ago."</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cJoe Biden: "Think about why the recession got so bad two years ago."\n\nJoe Biden took office two years ago.\u201d</div> — Julio Gonzalez - juliogonzalez.com (@Julio Gonzalez - juliogonzalez.com)

<p>It's unclear what recession Biden is referring to since we've been assured by his administration that there is no recession. There has never been a definition of the term, recession. In fact, recessions actually don't exist at all.  Just like war is peace and freedom is slavery. It's common sense, man!</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cRECESSION:\n\nReporter: "Is the White House trying to change the common definition of a recession?"\n\nKarine Jean-Pierre: "We're seeing the strength of the economy and the labor market."\u201d</div> — Forbes (@Forbes)

<p>And finally, Biden also took the opportunity today to lament the recent years of divisive politics: <br /></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>He's actually not wrong here. The past few years have been quite politically divisive. I mean, remember when Trump gave that <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/what-are-maga-republicans" target="_blank">speech</a> from Hell about extremist Biden Democrats destroying the country?</p><p>Oh wait...</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Okay, well, what about when <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-inauguration" target="_blank">Governor Ron DeSantis</a> wanted to ban vaccinated individuals from polite society and called it a "pandemic of the vaxxed"?

<p>It's almost like the division Biden referenced has come exclusively from one side. But that's crazy talk!</p><p><p>

## 'All rocks are my friend': Lip reading 'expert' swears on God this is what AOC and Matt Gaetz were chatting about

No word on who the NKRs (Never Kevin Rebels) are going to nominate. They went with <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/byron-donalds-rescue-plan" target="_blank">Rep. Byron Donalds</a> for round five, which would have been dope. Though through the chaos, there were two odd conversations caught on camera. Social media influencer Rep. AOC speaking separately with <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/rep-paul-gosar-posts-series-of-tweets-to-spell-epstein-didnt-kill-himself" target="_blank">Rep. Paul Gossar</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/matt-gaetz-chip-roy-speaker" target="_blank">Rep.

Both of them. Social media influencer Rep. AOC in her side hustle as a congresswoman is on what is called the "far-left." Gosar and Gaetz (who is leading the rebels) are both on what is called the "far-right." We are to believe they should be hating each other. Yet there they were yucking it up as normal colleagues would. It was very off-putting.</p><p>It's also unclear what they could be talking about! No word on the Gosar/AOC conversation. But lip-reading expert "Bad Lip Reading" was able to pick up the AOC/Gaetz kibitz.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">What they were saying — trust me, I do this professionally. <a href="https://t.co/ni6TX3Hq6a">pic.twitter.com/ni6TX3Hq6a</a><br />— Bad Lip Reading (@BadLipReading) <a href="https://twitter.com/BadLipReading/status/1610463707049623553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>AOC: I've heard that the floor asked for shrubs to be out in the common areas?

</p>
<p>The funny thing is...with the GOP fighting each other, let's call it a style vs substance issue. "Substance" in this case would be issues and policies. "Style" is the rules and way we get to those issues. Rep. AOC, I would bet, agrees with Gaetz and Goasr on style. I'd bet she has the same issues with her party's leadership as Gaetz and the NCRs have with theirs.</p><p>She might <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/matt-gaetz-chip-roy-speaker" target="_blank">even join Gaetz on things like</a> a ban on Congress members trading individual stocks. Or a rule that bills should include only one subject. People on both sides who aren't entrenched incumbents would agree with those.</p><p><p><em>The Louder with Crowder Dot Com Website is <strong>on Instagram now!</strong> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lwcnewswire/" target="_blank">Follow us at @lwcnewswire</a> and tell a friend!</em></p></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-abortion-limits-psaki" target="_blank">Biden</a> has faced heavy criticism over the contradiction between his self-proclaimed Catholic faith and ardent support for abortion. The Catholic Catechism states that abortion is a mortal sin, or an act that “destroys charity in the heart of man by a grave violation of God's law; it turns man away from God." Joe Biden was denied Communion in South Carolina back in 2019 over his support for abortion. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nancy-pelosi-chronicle-pope" target="_self">Nancy Pelosi</a> was also denied Communion by the archbishop of San Francisco, Salvatore Cordileone. Cordileone said Pelosi was engaging in scandal by leading other Catholics astray from Church teaching and preferring her own judgment.</p><p>Pro-abortion, self-proclaimed Catholic politicians seem to be having an unfortunate effect on American Catholics. According to Pew Research, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/10/20/8-key-findings-about-catholics-and-abortion/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">56%</a> of Catholics believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases, despite this putting them at odds with Church teaching. That stat does fall once Mass attendance is taken into account. </p><p>Back in September, Karine Jean-Pierre was unable to answer whether or not Biden supports any limits on abortion at any point in pregnancy. Last year, Pope Francis <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/pope-criticizes-bidens-abortion-views-catholic-self-identity-incoherence" target="_blank">described</a> Biden's support for abortion as "incomprehensible" and advised the President to check his conscience. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cPeter Doocy asked Karine Jean-Pierre whether Biden supports ANY limits on abortion.\n\nKJP spends TWO WHOLE MINUTES filibustering, dodging, and refusing to answer the question.\u201d</div> — Townhall.com (@Townhall.com)

<p>However, Biden <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-pope-francis-told-good-catholic-amid-criticism/story?id=80769817" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">claimed</a> Pope Francis called him a "good Catholic" and to continue receiving Communion, and that the issue of abortion didn't come up at all during their unusually long 90-minute meeting. Yes, this was the same meeting where it was rumored Biden had a calamitous "bathroom accident" <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/did-biden-poop-his-pants-in-rome/" target="_blank">that "fact checkers" swear isn't true</a>.</p><p><p>

## Taliban is Reportedly ‘Worried’ About Andrew Tate and We Have Some Questions

They are worried about Andrew Tate and they are asking us if he’s free yet. They say westerners need Andrew Tate because we are oppressed by feminists.”</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>It's unclear how many members of the Taliban are enrolled in Tate's "How to Be a G" program. Perhaps this is where they learned some of their Alpha Male tactics, like preventing women from receiving an education or traveling more than 43 miles without a male escort. </p><p>Tate has actually expressed his fondest for the Taliban in the past:</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cGreat to meet @real_lord_miles\n\nEncompassing the true British spirit of adventure, returning home with stories to tell. \n\nVery interesting to hear the Taliban are fans of mine. \n\nTop G! Top G!\u201d</div> — Andrew Tate (@Andrew Tate)

<p>Ah yes, when discussing the Taliban, "family values" are absolutely the first two words that come to mind. That and beheadings. They go hand in hand, really. </p><p>Will we soon see Andrew Tate combatting western degeneracy alongside some of the world's most notorious terrorists? Only time will tell!</p><p>Tate’s arrest came after a bizarre interaction with climate activist <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/greta-thunberg-cop26" target="_blank">Greta Thunberg</a>, in which he randomly tweeted at her about the emissions of his 33 cars. After some back and forth, Tate replied with a video of himself in a robe and smoking a cigar. A pizza box was visible on the counter in front of him. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cThank you for confirming via your email address that you have a small penis @GretaThunberg \n\nThe world was curious. \n\nAnd I do agree you should get a life \u2764\ufe0f\u201d</div> — Andrew Tate (@Andrew Tate)

<p>Internet sleuths theorized the pizza box tipped off authorities to Tate’s location, as it is from a Romanian company. However, a Washington Post reporter has stated the pizza box is not what tipped off authorities. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cThe pizza box in Andrew Tate\u2019s video didn\u2019t lead to his detention, Romanian prosecutor\u2019s office told us.

<p>Tate gained popularity last year after he was <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/big-tech-banned-andrew-tate" target="_blank">banned</a> from almost all social media platforms. Meta stated his ban was due to violations of their policies on dangerous individuals and organizations and hate speech. Tate was banned from YouTube for similar policy violations, and actually got the boot from Twitter back in 2017 when he said women “bear some responsibility” for being sexually assaulted. Tate’s Twitter account was reinstated last November following Elon Musk's purchase of the platform. </p><p><p>

<p>Garcia wasn't able to be sworn in yesterday, as the House adjourned without selecting a new speaker. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/matt-gaetz-chip-roy-speaker" target="_blank">Kevin McCarthy</a> failed to get the required 218 votes, and a new speaker must be chosen before new members can be inaugurated. </p><p>In his Twitter bio, Garcia labels himself a Progressive, comic book nerd, and educator, along with the American and LGBTQIP+EEIP2S flags. He is the first openly gay immigrant in Congress. </p><p>His <a href="https://robertgarcia.com/what-im-fighting-for/" target="_blank">website</a> explains how his mother brought him to America "without the right immigration status." She was able to apply for permanent residency after progressive immigration laws were passed in the 1980s. </p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://fox40.com/inside-california-politics/congressman-elect-robert-garcia-on-his-priorities-for-congress/" target="_blank">Fox40</a>, he stated his main priorities in Congress are protecting "democracy," focusing on "facts" and "truth," and creating a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants in America.  Fingers crossed he'll be too distracted by all the cool comic books to get to that last part. </p><p><p>

## Watch: Jordan Peterson shows off that Big Tech drip in his new Twitter suit, complete with an Elon Musk tie

I was surprised to hear he would do Elon Musk like that. But Peterson has had <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jordan-peterson-rather-die-twitter" target="_blank">multiple issues</a> with <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jordan-peterson-twitter-elliot-page" target="_blank">the bird app</a> last year. I'm sure JP had his reasons. I doubt Elon would take it personally.</p><p>No, Jordan Peterson meant an actual suit inspired by Twitter. It has an Elon Musk tie and everything.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rumble">

</p>
<p>There is a custom suit company that made Peterson twelve suits for each of his 12 Rules for Life. When asked if he wanted a Twitter suit, Peterson responded "well, NOW I do." The Elon Musk tie is getting the bulk of the attention, but for me, it's the lining made up of Twitter comments that screams "Drip Gawd."</p><p>Some people are making fun. But I think the suit makes him look like a based Doctor Who.  Tell me you wouldn't love to see Peterson's adventures throughout all of space and time. </p><p>My only regret is that he didn't rock this suit BEFORE Elon took over. The meltdowns from Twitter 1.0 employees could have been turned into a renewable energy source. Some of them may have been too triggered to come out of their nap pods.</p><p>Elon Musk hasn't commented yet on Peterson's styin' and profilin'. Though he is interested in news that Peterson could lose his license to practice psychology unless he <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jordan-peterson-college-psycology" target="_blank">goes through social media re-eduction</a>.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">That is extremely concerning!<br />— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1610371188726931457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 3, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p><br /></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Please live-stream this on Twitter Spaces<br />— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1610416985250095109?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 3, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Jordan Peterson.

## Adam Schiff made such a ridiculous ask to get a journalist suspended from Twitter, even Twitter said 'we don't do that'

The latest edition comes from Matt Taibbi and is called <a href="https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1610394287992344576" target="_blank">Twitter and the FBI “Belly Button”</a>. The jist of it is that in 2020, everything was Russian disinformation, and everyone in the government expected Twitter to do something about it. And you can't talk about Russian disinformation without discussing the biggest purveyor of it, Rep. Adam Schiff.</p><p>If he wasn't <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/adam-schiff-view-steele-dossier" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">lying about Russia</a> (according to critics), he was <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/watch-adam-schiff-reads-from-ukraine-transcript-which-he-pulled-out-of-his-ass" target="_blank">lying about Ukraine</a> (according to critics). Anything to have an excuse to impeach Donald Trump. That was his main quest. It turns out from the Twitter Files, he had a side quest to get journalists suspended who he didn't like. Schiff wanted Paul Sperry, a journialst from Real Clear Investigations and the New York Post, suspended from the bird app. The claim was that he was spreading "what comes between P and R" conspiracies.</p><p>Schiff's ask was so ridiculous, not ever the commie-as-f*ck sympathizers as Twitter would oblige.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">28.“WE DON’T DO THIS” Even Twitter declined to honor Schiff’s request at the time. Sperry was later suspended, however. <a href="https://t.co/9PX2Zw5Nzj">pic.twitter.com/9PX2Zw5Nzj</a><br />— Matt Taibbi (@mtaibbi) <a href="https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1610394287992344576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 3, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Silly, Schiff. Had he gone through the FBI like a normal Democrat, he could have gotten Sperry yeeted. The reporter <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2022/08/23/paul_sperry_fbi_trump_raid_scif.html" target="_blank">was permanently suspended two years</a> later after reporting on the FBI raiding Donald Trump's house.</p><p>Of course, as Sperry says, “I have never promoted any ‘[between P and R] conspiracies.’ Ever. Not on Twitter. Not anywhere.” But Sperry was the guy who leaked the name of the "Ukraine whistleblower" at the center of the first impeachment of Donald Trump. Schiff was angry about that.</p><p>Adam Schiff has some explaining to do.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Hey <a href="https://twitter.com/RepAdamSchiff?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RepAdamSchiff</a>, what’s this?<br />— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1610412594375827458?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 3, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Or, he WOULD have some explaining to do if most of the corporate media didn't agree with him. Questioning Schiff on this would require their acknowledgment of the Twitter Files in the first place.</p><p><p>

## Speeches by Chip Roy, Matt Gaetz are MUST WATCH to understand why Kevin McCarthy is getting yeeted from becoming Speaker

Though, unlike liberal media, I'm not using "chaos" as a pejorative. Chaos is good if there is a reason behind it. And as you are about to hear from Matt Gaetz and Chip Roy, there are specific and understandable reasons WHY they are blocking Kevin McCarthy from becoming Speaker.</p><p>First, a mea culpa because I <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-inauguration" target="_blank">was a little too smug yesterday in "bothsidesing" how embarrassing everyone was</a>. I was distracted and not paying as close attention as I should have been. To be clear, Kevin McCarthy is a swamp creature who stands for nothing, and he's not entitled to deez nuts let alone to become Speaker of the House. The entitlement is what it boils down to. The Rebels want changes to the rules and to have actual debates on issues to affect change for the American people. The Only Kevins only want Kevin because it's his turn. And they're the side making things personal.</p><p>Which as <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/masks-chip-roy" target="_blank">Chip Roy</a> (who would be my pick for Speaker) says, it's strictly business.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Patriot <a href="https://t.co/fvsKLcodes">pic.twitter.com/fvsKLcodes</a><br />— Wade Miller (@WadeMiller_USMC) <a href="https://twitter.com/WadeMiller_USMC/status/1610386168365056001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 3, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>This place has to change. And the change comes from adopting rules in procedures that makes us actually have to do our job. Or it comes from leadership. And people ask me "well, what do you want?" I want the TOOLS or I want the LEADERSHIP to stop The Swamp from running over the average American every single day.</blockquote><p>Sentiment echoed by Rebel Leader Matt Gaetz.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WATCH?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WATCH</a> | Rep. <a href="https://twitter.com/mattgaetz?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@mattgaetz</a> says congress members were threatened to vote for Kevin McCarthy.<br /><br />“I’m not here to participate in some puppet show.. I don’t want to relive the Benghazi experience where it’s just theatre pretending to be oversight” <a href="https://t.co/V98Gg1ns61">pic.twitter.com/V98Gg1ns61</a><br />— El American (@ElAmerican_) <a href="https://twitter.com/ElAmerican_/status/1610335406263762944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 3, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>I'm not here to participate in a puppet show where we pass a bunch of messaging bills, send them to the Senate, watch them die, fail to use leverage, and fail to hold the Biden Adminstration accountable.</blockquote><p>And for all the criticism of Gaetz that he's doing this all for show, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/matt-gaetz-four-issues" target="_blank">he's also laid out four specific issues</a> both sides of the chamber can get started working on. A "ban on Congress members trading individual stocks" and a rule that "bills should include only one subject" would bring INSTANT and much-needed change.</p><p>It is 8:40 AM eastern as I'm writing this. By the time you are reading it, everything could have been worked out and we have a new Speaker of the House. It may even be Kevin McCarthy. Which...meh.</p><p>The fight may have been for naught. But there is NOTHING wrong with there being a fight to get there. This is how Congress is supposed to be. We're just not used to anything that isn't scripted and predetermined.</p><p><p>

## Watch: ESPN shocks audiences by leading a prayer for Damar Hamlin. Actual prayer. Not just a hashtag.

Mocking "thoughts and prayers" after a tragedy are Democrat's favorite pastime. We've even seen a woman in England <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/praying-arrested-silence" target="_blank">get arrested for praying in the "wrong" place</a>. People who pray are ignorant rubes who don't believe in The Science, according to people who then light their Anthony Fauci worship candles.</p><p>Yet when <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/damar-hamlin-buffalo-bills-charity" target="_blank">Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin</a> collapsed after having a wide receiver collide dead on with his chest, prayer was the first thing people turned to. Or, "hashtag prayer," at least. That wasn't enough for ESPN analyst Dan Orlovsky who did something you rarely see anyone do on TV. Pray. Not only pray OUT LOUD with WORDS, but also acknowledge the existence of God.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Dan Orlovsky didn’t just send off a ‘praying for Damar Hamlin’ tweet. <br /><br />He paused during NFL Live, bowed his head, and prayed.<br /><br />Powerful, brave, and genuine. 🙏 <br /> <a href="https://t.co/zj98W3EaSC">pic.twitter.com/zj98W3EaSC</a><br />— Mark Harris (@itismarkharris) <a href="https://twitter.com/itismarkharris/status/1610413310645501952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 3, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>God, we come to You in these moments that we don't understand. That are hard. Because we believe that coming to You and praying to You has impact. We're sad. We're angry. We want answers, but some things are unanswerable. We just want to pray. Truly come to You and pray for strength for Damar, for healing for Damar, for comfort for Damar. To be with their family and give them peace. If we didn't believe prayer worked we wouldn't ask this of You, God. I believe in prayer. We believe in prayer. We lift up Damar Hamlin's name in Your name. Amen.</blockquote><p>Amen.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">No sound.
