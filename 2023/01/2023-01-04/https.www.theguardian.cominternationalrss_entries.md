## Aston Villa and Ings peg back Wolves in battle of the Basque managers

<p>When Unai Emery and Julen Lopetegui last duelled on the touchline, in La Liga in September, their respective Villarreal and Sevilla sides could not be pulled apart and here the managers had to settle for another point, the Aston Villa substitute Danny Ings cancelling out Daniel Podence’s classy first-half strike. Emery and Lopetegui both hail from the Basque Country and were appointed to rescue missions in cooler climes at these Midlands rivals within 10 days of each other towards the end of last year.</p><p>Five minutes before kick-off Emiliano Martínez took to the pitch parading the Golden Glove award last seen covering his crotch on the winners’ podium in Qatar and soaked up the adulation from the Villa support after becoming the club’s first player to lift the World Cup.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/04/aston-villa-wolves-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## Harry Kane double sparks Tottenham’s rout of Crystal Palace

<p> Perhaps Tottenham have finally realised that they do not have to be 2-0 down before letting their talent shine. They have too much firepower to play such a restrained brand of football and when Harry Kane is in this kind of mood, so full of creativity and so hungry for goals, it is difficult to understand why Antonio Conte makes life at Spurs sound so wearisome.</p><p>Of course, whether this excellent performance alone will convince Conte that he can build at Spurs remains to be seen. Even so, this was better. Every Spurs player contributed, although none of it would have been possible without Kane, who sparked this rout of Crystal Palace with two goals at the start of the second half.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/04/crystal-palace-spurs-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Rhoda Kwan on the longing and guilt felt by many Hongkongers living the life of an exile in Taiwan</p><p>In April 2022, Hong Kong photographer <a href="https://substack.com/redirect/b1ffc631-1601-4782-8ab5-6bf657f686b7?j=eyJ1IjoiNWRmZzAifQ.ExrLOiq6G2s6acalXIlikeu-QQebv8fQhrmVqEVyPT0">Ko Chung Ming</a> exhibited his latest work in Dadaocheng, on one of Taipei’s oldest streets. Hanging from the ceiling of a small converted art space were 14 enlarged portraits of Hongkongers who had, out of fear of arrest or unwillingness to live in a diminished version of their city, fled to Taiwan, to start over.</p><p>Ko’s previous exhibition captured the wounds protesters had suffered at the hands of police in 2019. Skin split open and fused back together on jagged red lines; black crevasses burnt into flesh by teargas canisters. This new collection shows what happened after the teargas subsided, when authorities turned from the blunt force of police batons to a tyrant’s law. All 14 images were overexposed, erasing the subjects’ faces. The accompanying blurbs identified some of them only by descriptions of their former lives in Hong Kong, and their hopes for new ones in Taiwan.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/05/ripped-away-from-home-we-are-haunted-by-the-hong-kong-taken-from-us">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Barely a couple of months into his tenure as Southampton manager, Nathan Jones must be wondering whether time is already running out. The Saints’ sixth successive Premier League defeat – this one at the hands of their relegation rivals Nottingham Forest, who recorded a first away win of the campaign thanks to Taiwo Awoniyi’s first-half goal – left Southampton four points adrift at the foot of the table and staring down the barrel of relegation.</p><p>It was no less than Steve Cooper’s side deserved after a committed display that restricted their opponents to only a handful of opportunities on a dismal night for the home supporters. But while the victory Forest propelled out of the bottom three as they attempt to consolidate after last season’s promotion, Southampton’s fans – whose team have spent the last decade in the top flight – can only fear the worst on this evidence. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/04/southampton-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Pro football typically stops for nothing, with teams playing on despite grievous injuries. On Monday, things were different</p><p>In September 2008, the Kansas City Chiefs safety Bernard Pollard smashed helmet-first into the knee of Tom Brady as the New England Patriots quarterback heaved a long pass down the field. The collision, which did not draw a penalty, reduced Brady to a writhing heap and sidelined him for the rest of the season with a torn ACL. But most striking to the reigning league MVP was what came next. “They play the game without you,” <a href="https://www.si.com/more-sports/2009/05/26/tom-brady">he told Sports Illustrated</a>. “You’re like, ‘Wow. That’s really what it’s like.’”</p><p>The NFL manages its inherent brutality with constant reassurances that it’s very much on top of the situation – when a man goes down, the medical team descends to whisk him into a tent or the stadium bowels for an X-ray or painkiller jab. The next man steps in. The game goes on.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/04/damar-hamlin-injury-nfl-postpone-game">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The world’s biggest Christian church needs to revive the open, progressive spirit of Vatican II</p><p>The funeral of Benedict XVI, which takes place on Thursday in St Peter’s Square, will not, of course, be followed by the drama and intrigue of a papal conclave to elect a new pontiff. Having become the first pope to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/11/pope-benedict-xvi-resigns-age">resign</a> his office for 600 years, taking on the new title of pope emeritus, Benedict moved to the sidelines of the Roman Catholic church’s public life. For the most part, he spent the last decade in private prayer and reflection.</p><p>But as the Catholic church contemplates its future direction, it would be a mistake to view Benedict’s death at the age of 95 as anything other than a significant moment. Though the notion of “two popes” worked better as the title of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNty1-9cfBQ">film</a> than as a true description of Vatican reality, the politics of Benedict’s retirement have undoubtedly been fraught.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/04/the-guardian-view-on-catholicism-after-benedict-winds-of-change-blow-from-below">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Elon Musk’s misadventure with Twitter is not the main factor in the dramatic decline in value</p><p>Only part of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jan/03/tesla-shares-price-value-decline-elon-musk">the plunge in Tesla’s stock market value</a> can be pinned on Elon Musk’s misadventure with Twitter. Yes, selling a few tens of billions of dollars-worth of Tesla stock – far more than he signalled at the outset – to fund the purchase was bound to dampen the mood among investors in the back seat. And, yes, the distraction factor is serious; Tesla’s non-executive directors should be screaming at the boss to get back to the day job.</p><p>But the main cause of Tesla’s decline from a $1.2tn valuation to today’s £350bn is surely very simple: the stock was ludicrously overpriced in the first place. Investors were required to believe that revenues could keep rocketing for years and competitors’ attempts to catch up with electric vehicles would barely affect Tesla’s profit margins.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/jan/04/tesla-stock-has-only-plunged-to-a-less-ludicrous-level-as-competitors-catch-up">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Cheekily enjoyable chiller where a devastated girl seems saved by an eerily self-possessed robot companion – but all is not as it seems</p><p>Not a robot so much as a hi-tech Frankenstein’s monster, stitched together with bits of Robocop and Terminator, but cheekily enjoyable just the same. This is a sci-fi chiller co-written by horror experts Akela Cooper and James Wan and directed by Gerard Johnstone. M3gan, or Model 3 Generative Android, is an eerily self-possessed blond tweenage girlbot, voiced by Jenna Davis, a state-of-the-art toy from the near future developed as a personal passion project by engineer Gemma (Allison Williams, from Get Out and HBO’s Girls) to the exasperation of her highly stressed boss David, amusingly played by Ronny Chieng.</p><p>To be properly developed, M3gan needs to “pair” with a little girl owner; she needs to sync up with an actual human, to learn her owner’s speech patterns, behavioural traits and emotional needs, so she can be properly close with her. And Gemma doesn’t have anyone to fill that post – until her nine-year-old niece Cady (Violet McGraw) is orphaned after a car crash and comes to live with Gemma, who must furthermore honour her late parents’ wish that she is homeschooled. This poor little girl, utterly devastated by her mom and dad’s death and without any friends her own age in a new city, is an obvious candidate to be M3gan’s new pal.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/04/m3gan-review-girlbot-horror-offers-entertaining-spin-on-teenage-growing-pains">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We NFL players often will say we are willing to die for this game. But what happens when the price that we insist that we are eager to pay comes up for collection?</p><p>There is no question that football is one of the most violent sports in the world and that players, including myself, are aware of the risk we take to play the game that we love. Even at the young age of 30, I talk to my former teammates about my surgeries, broken bones and aches from my time in the NFL, as though my battle scars are medals of honor. The pride comes from achieving my dreams of playing at the highest level and understanding that I survived something few men can fathom. </p><p>The fans, the coaches and the executives will keep track of the scoreboard, statistics, wins, losses, championships, fantasy points and countless other factors. But after stepping away from the game, players often count the good days we have from the bad, the day-to-day tasks that we can no longer do versus the ones that we can, and the prescriptions we now depend on to live whole lives. It is a scary truth, one that each player faces before, during and after their career, yet we still pursue this dream to its sometimes bitter end. </p><p><em>RK Russell played three NFL seasons for the Dallas Cowboys and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/04/damar-hamlin-brotherhood-ryan-russell-essay">Continue reading...</a>

In between, the Associates’ Party Fears Two is five and a half sweeping minutes of art-pop perfection – a song commonly hailed for the vaulting, otherworldly vocals of mercurial singer Billy Mackenzie yet every bit as much a testament to the songwriting and musicianship of multi-instrumentalist Alan Rankine.</p><p>Formed by Mackenzie and Rankine between Edinburgh and Dundee in 1979, the Associates were genius architects of magical, muscular outsider anthems; a febrile cocktail of sex, drugs, chaos, breathtaking good looks and rampant creativity. For a fleeting period in 1982, they kissed the sky with three hit singles. As a producer, Rankine helped craft a shimmering swathe of 1980s music for artists including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/feb/24/cocteau-twins-10-of-the-best">Cocteau Twins</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/apr/09/new-band-cathode-ray?CMP=gu_com">Paul Haig</a> and the Pale Fountains.

<p>These games will not end well for the country. The stakes are huge</p><p>After a new session begins, the first order of business for the House of Representatives is to pick a speaker. For a century this has been a mere formality, with the party in power having enough organization and respect for the country to move swiftly on to other matters. But on Tuesday the Republican party broke this streak of basic competence, failing in three separate ballots to come up with the votes to install Kevin McCarthy, the presumed frontrunner, as speaker.</p><p>With the group of hard-right irreconcilables opposing McCarthy getting larger rather than smaller as the day went on, it quickly became clear that the wannabe speaker had no plan for breaking the deadlock. If he hoped that his opponents would eventually tire of symbolism and bow down to practical reality, he was mistaken – for a large group of Republican lawmakers, particularly those in the far-right Freedom Caucus, symbolism is the entire purpose of holding office.

<p>Novelist and screenwriter whose tales of women taking control of their own destinies included The Life and Loves of a She-Devil</p><p>The novelist Fay Weldon, who has died aged 91, was to an unusual extent the creation of her own extravagant imagination. A polemicist whose opinions shaped themselves around the plot of her latest book, a pragmatist who giggled her way through every sentence, she was mischievous and evasive, yet wilfully and wittily life-affirming. “I long for a day of judgment when the plot lines of our lives will be neatly tied, and all puzzles explained, and the meaning of events made clear,” she wrote in her rackety 2002 autobiography, Auto da Fay. “We take to fiction, I suppose, because no such thing is going to happen, and at least on the printed page we can observe beginnings, middles and ends and can find where morality resides.”</p><p>With these lines, Weldon gave a big wink to her future obituarists: catch me if you can, she appears to be saying – there is nothing you can write about me that I have not written about myself, and it is the storyteller who is in command of the meaning of events, insofar as there is one.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/04/fay-weldon-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Colonialism was born from the greed for spices and led to today’s globalised world.

<p>This pacy Netflix docu-series plays like a Hollywood thriller, with its trail of grimly fascinating testimonies and astonishing curveballs about the ‘financial serial killer’</p><p>It’s 1992 and business is booming on the 19th floor of the Lipstick Building in midtown Manhattan. Here, Wall Street statesman <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/bernard-madoff">Bernie Madoff</a> presides over his “risk-less” trading empire. The man is revered as a magician: a god of finance renowned for being “almost all-knowing” about the market. A warm family atmosphere exudes from his immaculate offices, up and down which Madoff is known to parade with a cigar clamped between his lips, swivelling a computer monitor back into position if he deems it an inch askew. No plants or photo frames are permitted on desks. The colour scheme, replicated in Madoff’s private jet, must be adhered to like the man. Yes, it’s true that he can be a brutal, controlling bully but he’s also a kind, generous, brilliant family man. You get the drift. This is how the myths of such men are spun. Just once, on a serious documentary such as <a href="https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81466159">Madoff: The Monster of Wall Street</a> (Netflix), I’d love a talking head to say: “He wasn’t an evil genius. He was a nasty, mediocre, morally bankrupt, dangerous arsehole.” Maybe next time.</p><p>Two floors down is another business. Madoff’s secret unregistered investment advisory firm, born in the early years of his career and dodgy from the outset. No trades take place here. Madoff takes the money, promises a return, then gives it to someone else. It’s a Ponzi scheme, and by the time the game’s up more than a decade later it’ll be worth a staggering $64bn. Here, fake paper trails and computer systems are created by working-class high-school graduates groomed from a young age to do Madoff’s dirty work. In stark contrast to the 19th floor, it’s a mess of paper, mid-1980s computers, dot matrix printers, filing cabinets, and an area known as The Cage where, according to one anonymous ex-17th floor employee, “everything was going down”. “Holy shit,” is a former FBI agent’s response as they recall the moment in 2008 when his team stormed the building and the scale of the biggest criminal enterprise in the history of Wall Street was revealed. “It was like walking into a time warp.” And yet everyone turned a blind eye, for decades.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/04/madoff-the-monster-of-wall-street-netflix-review-grubby-and-jaw-dropping-from-start-to-finish">Continue reading...</a>

## Booze is 10% ethanol, 90% marketing so maybe it's time to try Dry January

<p>Celebrity booze sponsorship has gotten ridiculous. Plus, studies show we can’t differentiate the taste of ‘good’ or ‘bad’ alcohol</p><p>I blame Gwyneth Paltrow, myself. The actor turned entrepreneur may not have been the first celebrity to launch a business empire, but the rise of Goop seems to have coincided with a craze for side hustles among the glitterati. Entertainers aren’t content with just entertaining any more – they’re all business moguls, too. Lil Nas X has a skincare line; Selena Gomez has a makeup brand; Jessica Alba has a baby product company; Kim Kardashian sells performance underwear.</p><p>While skincare has become a popular celeb business, the biggest grift is probably still booze. By one calculation, there were fewer than 40 celebrity-affiliated booze brands in 2018; now there are reportedly <a href="https://mag.sommtv.com/2022/09/celebrity-spirits/">more than 350</a>. I won’t list them all but, to give you a taste, Graham Norton is shilling wine, the Chainsmokers (remember them?) have a Tequila brand, Jamie Foxx has a bourbon, Cameron Diaz has launched a <a href="https://www.livekindly.com/cameron-diaz-vegan-wine-brand-avaline/#:~:text=Cameron%20Diaz%20just%20launched%20her,and%20founder%20of%20Versed%20Skincare.">“clean” wine brand</a> that is vegan-friendly.

So when a middle-aged man, <strong> </strong>fresh from a divorce, declared to me in our shared office in Beirut, “I’m only going to spend quality time with quality people. No more killing time with anyone for the sake of it,” a flicker suddenly twitched in my naive mid-20s brain.</p><p>It hit me right at a point of growing unease with my social surroundings.

<p>The big-money heist hit is fun and gripping – but it blows up the main rule of storytelling. Will being able to watch eight episodes in 40,320 random ways ever work?</p><p>If you are a certain type of viewer, the arrival of Netflix’s new drama Kaleidoscope will have filled you with excitement. That is because Kaleidoscope represents nothing less than a bold new vision of storytelling. There are eight episodes in total. Some are set before a heist, some after the heist and one episode concerns the heist itself. But here’s the thing: you can watch the episodes in any order you like. </p><p>There’s the (randomised) order that Netflix serves up, or any other order you can dream up on a whim. It’s a nice idea, isn’t it? After all, Netflix was the service that freed us from the shackles of linear scheduling, so it makes sense that it should now attempt to free us from the shackles of linear storytelling.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/04/kaleidoscope-the-netflix-heist-show-you-can-watch-in-any-order-you-like">Continue reading...</a>

## Artist Jenny Holzer: ‘Women are not horrible. We’re largely not the problem’

<p>For five decades, Holzer has used public spaces to make provocative declarations about politics and power. As she wins a major award, she discusses abortion rights, the climate crisis and her relative who was a witch </p><p></p><p>The Big Moose Deli &amp; Country Store, in the small town of Hoosick in Upstate New York, is nearly overwhelmed by its outsized red-lettered signs advertising cider doughnuts, maple syrup, souvenirs and a military discount. Two miles north is the farm where, since the 1980s, the artist Jenny Holzer has lived. She and her six-person team work inside a grey corrugated metal barn they refer to as “the warehouse”. Tucked tidily into a sloping hay field, it is indiscernible among the other barns along the same road: there is nothing to suggest it houses the work of one of the world’s most celebrated living conceptual artists.</p><p>This is apt. Although Holzer is one of the most recognisable figures in contemporary art, her work also bears a distinct anonymity. Her primary medium is text – writ large, flashing, scrolling, italicised, bolded, emphatic – which she uses to address the untruths espoused by governments, corporations and others in power who exploit truth for more power. Her best-known series is Truisms, which originated in posters Holzer hung in the streets of Manhattan in the late 1970s, often bearing provocative and charged declarations. Holzer has also<strong> </strong>painted them on <a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/63755">canvas</a>, engraved them into bronze and aluminium plaques and carved them into marble benches. Perhaps the most popular is the deadpan observation “ABUSE OF POWER COMES AS NO SURPRISE,” which glowed above Times Square in 1982.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jan/04/artist-jenny-holzer-women-are-not-horrible-were-largely-not-the-problem">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Astronaut who took part in America’s first successful manned space mission, Apollo 7, in 1968</p><p>On 11 October 1968, Walter Cunningham, who has died aged 90, and his fellow crew members, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/may/05/obituaries.spaceexploration">Wally Schirra</a> and Donn Eisele, became the first astronauts to fly in an Apollo spacecraft.

Their vehicle was Apollo 7, which Cunningham regarded as providing the first of the five highly successful “giant steps” – Apollos 8, 9 and 10 provided the next three – that culminated, 10 months later, with Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, from Apollo 11, making the first moon landing.</p><p>The first Apollo mission, Apollo 1, had ended catastrophically in January 1967 when its three crew members were incinerated during a launchpad rehearsal, and the following missions were unmanned. But by October 1968, while the US was convulsed with anti-Vietnam war and civil rights protests, Apollo 7 was orbiting faultlessly and the astronauts were testing modules for the moon landing. However, Apollo 7 was not a happy ship. “The only thing that wasn’t working smoothly was the crew,” observed their fellow astronaut Tom Stafford.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jan/04/walter-cunningham-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

Nearly 9 million people will participate in dry January this year, according to Alcohol Concern. The campaign, devised by the charity in 2013 to change drinking culture through<a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/article/27/5/929/4209886"> “social contagion</a>”, has boomed in popularity over the past decade, and points to a corresponding rise in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jul/01/sober-curious-alcohol-abuse">the sober curious</a> (people who drink less or not at all). But dig a little deeper behind the statistics and you will find a growing disparity between young and older people in attitudes towards alcohol.</p><p>According to Alcohol Concern, a quarter of people aged 18-34 are planning to abstain from drinking this month, compared with only 10% of people aged 55 and over. It is a similar picture for people who want to reduce their alcohol intake in 2023 – 40% of 18-34s as opposed to 20% of over 55s, despite the latter age group drinking twice as much as young people in a week. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/04/baby-boomers-dry-january-generation-drinking-booze">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Whether sad, fierce or downright murderous, these clairvoyant figures have enthralled writers from Sophocles to Charlotte Brontë and Hilary Mantel</p><p>At the end of his prophetic journey through hell, purgatory and heaven, Dante has a vision of a book. Standing in the presence of God, he sees “bound up with love together in one volume, what through the universe in leaves is scattered”. Here is a basic taxonomy then: God is a novelist. Human beings are His characters. Prophets are the readers.<br /><br />More often than not, the way that it works is that human beings come to despise prophets, just as you might come to despise someone who has read the story of your life and keeps trying to tell you about it while you’re in the middle of trying to live it.<br /><br />Thus it is hard to be a prophet. Prophets are havers of visions and bad dreams; they are difficult to be around.</p><p>Like gods, writers sometimes introduce prophets into their invented universes. When they do, the prophet takes up a special position between reader and character. They are messengers from beyond the back of the book. Because they are so like us – the readers of the books – and so unlike us at the same time, prophets are uncanny and scary. <br /><br />My book, <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-end-of-nightwork-9781783789528?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article">The End of Nightwork</a>, is about that most pointless and painful of things: the passage of time. In the book, the protagonist – Pol – is haunted by the influence of a 17th-century millenarian, called Bartholomew Playfere. Like all prophets, Playfere refuses to be part of his own time. Instead he becomes part of a future, a future that Pol coincidentally participates in.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/04/top-10-novels-and-stories-about-prophets-aidan-cottrell-boyce-the-end-of-nightwork">Continue reading...</a>

Some would simply stand, comatose, oblivious to my presence.

<p>It’s high time this former store-cupboard favourite made a comeback – but which recipe does it best?</p><p>Don’t laugh, but there was a point in my life when carrot and coriander soup seemed<a href="https://www.eater.com/22723189/espresso-martinis-nineties-nostalgia-trend-foods"> the height of culinary sophistication</a>, the rustic carton offering a thrilling glimpse of a world of possibility beyond chunky vegetable soup with its single sprig of curly parsley as garnish. Smitten, I ate the stuff almost every lunchtime for months, and then, as tends to happen with such obsessions, I went off it in the same way I did Archers and lemonade: abruptly and decisively.</p><p>Two decades later, however, I’ve fallen in love all over again – with carrot and coriander soup, anyway. Even given the rapid expansion of my palate in the intervening years, it remains an intriguing combination of flavours: the sweetness of the vegetable and the zestiness of the herb, with a simplicity that, in an era when even Cup A Soup comes in 15 different varieties, is almost quaint. These days, though, I prefer to make my lunch, rather than microwaving it. But what’s the best way to recreate the experience?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/04/how-to-make-the-perfect-carrot-and-coriander-soup-recipe-felicity-cloake">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Incoming bomb cyclone system threatens to wreak havoc in the drought-stricken state while doing little to alleviate its water woes</p><p>Millions of Californians are bracing for another soaking, as the next set of severe storms are forecast to hammer the state through the end of the week. In a stormy start to the year, where heavy rains and howling winds have already toppled trees and caused cascades down streets and hillsides resulting in wide-scale damage and one confirmed fatality, the incoming system is threatening to wreak even more havoc.</p><p>“We are expecting fairly widespread flooding impacts,” said Richard Bann, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center, noting that heavy snows across the Sierra Nevada range and strong winds could also pose problems for travel and safety. “It is really a multi-hazard event that will last perhaps the better part of two days.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/04/california-bomb-cyclone-storm-flooding">Continue reading...</a>

Georgia now boasts a highly engaged electorate that continues to turn out in record numbers election after election.</p><p>While various factors contribute to this, many in Georgia point to the state’s grassroots coalition, built over the last decade, that sought to register, engage and educate voters like never before.

## Unfinished Business by Michael Bracewell review – a melancholy glamour

<p>The cultural critic weaves a bleakly nostalgic tale of a middle-aged outsider stranded by dislocation and regret</p><p>At times during Michael Bracewell’s new novel the mood becomes so elusive, the change of scene so abrupt, that you start to wonder whether you’ve missed some vital bit of information a few pages earlier. It’s like bedtime reading: that absorption in the story just before you nod off, only to pick it up the next morning and wonder “Who’s this character?”, or “Did I know about that?” The tenor of Unfinished Business feels dreamlike, fragmentary, except that the writing is also exact and alert, anchored very particularly in time and place. Better known as a cultural critic, Bracewell hasn’t published a novel in 21 years. This is quite the comeback.</p><p>It focuses mainly on Martin Knight, a Prufrockian clerk in a dark suit, an office “lifer” who commutes from Hackney, east London, to the glass-and-steel canyons of the City to do a job he no longer understands. (Bracewell’s 1992 novel, The Conclave, featured a similar Martin at an earlier stage of life.) His reveries on the train carry him back to his suburban youth in 1970s Kent, public school, and the first stirrings of life as a wistful flâneur, smoking posh cigarettes from the Burlington Arcade and getting dressed up to the nines for cocktails at the Café Royal. He regrets not going to Oxford, instead finding himself “friendless” at college in Liverpool, an aesthetic snob who loftily dismisses his fellow students for their lack of style.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/04/unfinished-business-by-michael-bracewell-review-a-melancholy-glamour">Continue reading...</a>

It began with an Ashes series and a 50-over World Cup in New Zealand, but the highlight was surely a maiden appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. Only two Tests were played, though, so this team is an all-format XI – with a slight bias towards Test performances.

## The Age of Interconnection by Jonathan Sperber review – a breathless race through recent history

<p>This sweeping survey of the post-war period contains fascinating insights but lacks an organising principle</p><p>It takes chutzpah to write a synoptic history of the world in the second half of the 20th century, a period within living memory of the reading public. But it is a history Jonathan Sperber handles with brio, summoning evidence from personal anecdotes and high theory, vignettes and statistics. In its range of themes and reconstructions, The Age of Interconnection invites favourable comparison with that other survey of the 20th century, Eric Hobsbawm’s The Age of Extremes. Yet it is quite unlike it. Where the Marxist historian offered a sweeping narrative arc illustrating the relentless advance of capitalism, Sperber dispenses with a unifying theme altogether. It’s a sign of the times: we’ve lost faith in grand narratives, more’s the pity. His framing sheds little light on his period. As every historian knows, all ages are ages of interconnection. </p><p>But what he loses in explanatory depth, he gains in intellectual breadth. Reading the book is a bit like watching a pentathlon. In lieu of fencing, riding, swimming, shooting and running, we have sections on the environment, economy, politics, society and cultural and intellectual life. It appears Sperber has taken Proust’s dictum to heart: “to write on everything to the point of exhaustion”. The exhaustiveness verges on redundancy at times, as in his tortuous excursions on staphylococcus and streptococcus infections, and rocket velocity. Class in the 20th century “took the form of a hierarchy”, he explains, as if to a Martian. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/04/the-age-of-interconnection-by-jonathan-sperber-review-a-breathless-race-through-recent-history">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The star presumably had one eye on the paycheque in this by-the-numbers thriller about a debt collector punching and shooting his way to bloody revenge</p><p>Antonio Banderas is a class act but there’s only so much class he can reasonably be expected to supply. Taking what was presumably an attractive paycheque, Banderas stars in a movie whose essential personality could only be appreciated if Blockbuster Video were to be brought back to life, just for one week, so this could be placed in the straight-to-video bin next to every till.</p><p>Veteran screenwriter W Peter Ilff (who co-wrote Point Break) has dug this one out of his desk drawer and Australian adman-turned-film-maker Richard Hughes directs. Banderas plays ’Cuda (short for Barracuda), a careworn Miami debt collector and ex-con, working for Estelle (Kate Bosworth), scary club owner and mob boss. He is estranged from the teen daughter who despises him and, out of fatherly sadness and a denied protective instinct, he tries to befriend and protect vulnerable runaway Billie (Zolee Griggs), who is promptly kidnapped and trafficked into a horrendous cybersex dungeon. The only way ’Cuda can save her is with his other mentoring project: a young guy called Stray (Mojean Aria) who earns money bareknuckle fighting and helping ’Cuda collect debts. Together they uncover an awful secret connecting them to this grisly exploitative crime.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/04/the-enforcer-review-antonio-banderas-adds-class-to-straight-to-video-throwback">Continue reading...</a>

## The right thrives on bullying ‘snowflakes’. But who will vote for it when they grow old?  | Owen Jones

<p>Young people deprived of prosperity may represent the first generation that doesn’t grow more conservative with age</p><p>Spite. When you dig down to the essence of modern rightwing politics, you’re left with little else. This wasn’t always the case. Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan offered clear, coherent visions of society, even if their worship of free markets delivered economic insecurity and stagnating living standards. While today’s Tories and Trumpified Republicans remain committed to defending privileged interests, their driving ambition now seems to be deliberately provoking fury among the progressively minded, much to the delight of their supporters. It’s this tendency that led Donald Trump to denounce Mexicans as criminals and attempt to ban Muslims from entering the US; it’s the same tendency that drove the home secretary, Suella Braverman, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/suella-braverman-rwanda-dream-obsession-b2195296.html">to declare</a> that her “dream” and “obsession” was to see a flight transporting asylum seekers to Rwanda. Cruelty is precisely the point.</p><p>But this spite has found a particular target in younger British and American people, many of whom increasingly embrace progressive social values such as anti-racism and LGBTQ+ rights (granted, this relies on a generous definition of youth as millennials – while the oldest members of Generation Z are only in their mid-20s, the most senior millennials have now reached their early 40s). These generations have become a common enemy for the right. The feeling is mutual.

<p>Ellis’s first novel in 13 years brilliantly fictionalises the secrets and desires of his high school years and the birth of his dark literary persona</p><p>Each episode of Bret Easton Ellis’s <a href="https://www.patreon.com/breteastonellispodcast">long-running podcast</a> begins with a monologue – sometimes a review, sometimes a mildly provocative essay, pillorying the culture’s supposed new puritans. His opening in September 2020 felt different. For 20 years, Ellis said, he’d been haunted by a book he longed to write but was terrified to begin: a memoir of sorts, detailing “what happened to me, and a few of my friends, one year at the end of high school”. His last false start – a few rough pages written with “trembling hands”, half-numbed by tequila – triggered “an anxiety attack so severe that it sent me to the emergency room”.</p><p>Ellis’s delivery was so perfectly pitched that it took a few moments to register the blurring of form. This wasn’t a podcast monologue; it was the opening to his first new novel in 13 years, The Shards.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/04/the-shards-by-bret-easton-ellis-review-a-triumphant-return-to-form">Continue reading...</a>

<ul><li>Australia 147-2 after winning the toss</li><li>Play interrupted repeatedly by bad light and rain</li></ul><p>Australia had the better of a shortened day to open the third Test against South Africa, as Sydney’s traditional New Year cloud cover ensured only 47 overs were bowled. An early tea break was called for bad light, with rain to follow, leaving the score at 138-1, before four more overs late in the day finished at 147-2. Usman Khawaja and Marnus Labuschagne put on 126 of those in concert, with Khawaja ending on 54 not out and Labuschagne out from the last ball of the day for 79, having earlier survived a contentious umpiring decision.</p><p>Both teams rejigged their line-ups anticipating a turning surface. South Africa swapped pace bowler Lungi Ngidi for off-spinner Simon Harmer, while bringing in reserve wicketkeeper Heinrich Klaasen to bat at three after Theunis de Bruyn headed home early for the birth of his child. Josh Hazlewood replaced Scott Boland in the pace ranks, while Australia chose Ashton Agar not in an all-rounder’s position but as one of four bowlers in Mitchell Starc’s place, partnering Nathan Lyon as a second spinner.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/04/australia-on-top-as-weather-halts-play-on-first-day-of-third-test-with-south-africa">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Director Chinonye Chukwu tells the story of Emmett Till, the black 14-year-old tortured and lynched in 1955 Mississippi for supposedly whistling at a white woman, and his mother Mamie Till’s fight for justice</p><p>A sick feeling of dread propels Chinonye Chukwu’s powerful movie: dread at the racist violence about to happen, dread at the racist violence that is then threatened against those standing up against it. This film is about Emmett Till, the black 14-year-old tortured and lynched in 1955 Mississippi for supposedly whistling at a white woman, whose testimony at the subsequent murder trial was disputed. (The closing credits icily remind us that this woman is still alive.) It is also about the boy’s mother Mamie Till, and her courageous campaign for justice, which began with a laceratingly painful decision to have an open casket at her son’s funeral to show everyone the shocking truth.</p><p>Danielle Deadwyler plays Mamie Till, a calm, determined professional woman and single parent; Whoopi Goldberg has a cameo as her mother, Alma. Jalyn Hall plays Emmett as a smart, extrovert kid with an irrepressible puppyish enthusiasm: cheeky, but no more cheeky than many another teenagers, and mostly just naive. He is sent from his home town of Chicago to stay with family in Mississippi for the summer, with a stern warning from his mother to be careful around white people.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/04/till-review-a-powerful-portrait-of-courage-in-the-face-of-barbaric-racism">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Should we really be aiming to walk 10,000 steps a day, or drink two litres of water? Time to sift fact from fiction</p><p>It’s easy to think that science is constantly changing its mind on all things dietary and health-based – if you have never suffered headline whiplash from trying to keep up with whether or not wine is good for you, you probably aren’t paying attention. In fact, our collective understanding is getting more nuanced, with ever-emerging longitudinal studies and meta-reviews getting us closer and closer to the truth about what is good for our bodies. Here are some widely held beliefs and what science says now – so you can start making informed health decisions this year.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/04/truth-behind-10-of-the-biggest-health-beliefs">Continue reading...</a>
