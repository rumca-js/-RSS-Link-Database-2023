Is it because my handful of <em>Marvel Snap</em> friends and colleagues are afraid of the awesome power of my decks? Perhaps. Is it because it’s 2:30PM ET on a workday? Also very possible. But I’ve been waiting for this update <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23437497/marvel-snap-developer-design-interview-mobile-steam">since the developers told me about it months ago</a>, and after the tiny taste of it I’ve gotten so far, I <em>hunger</em> for more.</p>

It <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/19/23517250/anker-eufy-security-camera-answer">repeatedly deflected</a> while utterly ignoring our emails. So shortly before Christmas, we gave the company an ultimatum: if Anker wouldn’t answer why its supposedly always-encrypted Eufy cameras were producing unencrypted streams — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/20/23519772/anker-eufy-security-camera-statement-december-19-2022">among other questions</a> — we would publish a story about the company’s lack of answers.</p>
<p id="KqSKMe">It worked. </p>
<p id="xqXepj">In a series of emails to <em>The Verge</em>, Anker has finally admitted its Eufy security cameras<em> </em>are <em>not</em> natively end-to-end encrypted — they can and <em>did</em> produce unencrypted video streams for Eufy’s web portal, like the ones we accessed from across the United States <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/30/23486753/anker-eufy-security-camera-cloud-private-encryption-authentication-storage">using an ordinary media player</a>. </p>

<p id="qlXKDI">The tool, known as a classifier, is relatively simple, though you will have to have a free OpenAI account to use it. You just paste text into a box, click a button, and it’ll tell you whether it thinks the text is very unlikely, unlikely, unclear if it is, possibly, or likely AI-generated. </p>

While the calculation is specific to the SE Long Range RWD trim, the AWD version is no slouch, either, with a maximum range of 316 miles.</p>
<p id="BbGAKS">Compared to the similarly sized RWD version of Tesla’s Model 3, the Ioniq 6 SE Long Range RWD could go a whole 89 miles further based on the EPA estimates.

  <p id="R9XI2g">Discord is slowing down graphics card memory clocks on some Nvidia GPUs. A recent Discord update has introduced a bug that slows down memory clocks by up to 200Hz on some Nvidia models, including the RTX 3080 and RTX 3060 Ti. Nvidia says it’s working on a fix.</p>

If you notice your memory clocks are dropping by up to 200Hz, you can download a GeForce 3D profile manager and apply a fix early. The full details are <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5443/">available in an Nvidia support article</a>, but if you’re willing to wait, Nvidia says a fix will be sent to users’ PCs “via an over the air update at a later date.”</p>

It’s not the most original premise. But in <em>Talk To Me</em> — the directorial debut from brothers Danny and Michael Philippou, best known for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz_cDc_2arKIb6SlJoqFT0w">their YouTube channel</a> — it takes on a new urgency and ferocity with a story that races to its bloody, brutal conclusion without letting up.</p>
<p id="AwJbhu">The occult object in question is an embalmed hand that supposedly has the power to let people see, and be possessed by, the spirits of dead folk. The process is straightforward: you grab the hand, say “talk to me” to summon a random specter, and then say “I let...</p>

So you can look forward to a good show as well as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23574119/samsung-galaxy-s23-unpacked-event-galaxy-book-3">some very interesting devices</a>.

  <p id="jN8o5Y">Lenovo’s <a href="https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/smart-collaboration-solutions-standalone-thinksmart-view-plus/">new $2,345 ThinkSmart View Plus</a> is one part monitor, one part dedicated video conferencing display for Microsoft Teams. If you’re using it for the former, it acts like a standard all-in-one display. There’s a built-in 4K webcam (with support for auto-framing) above the 27-inch 1080p screen and a soundbar with two 5W speakers and four microphones below it. You can connect to the whole thing via USB-C, the connector of choice for a more civilized age.</p>
<p id="3plGOg">But the ThinkSmart View is perhaps more interesting when used as a standalone video conferencing device. Lenovo’s spec sheet says it’s running Android and powered by a Qualcomm processor. It offers native access to “Teams chat, calendar, and files, while also enabling workers to join...</p>

  <p id="hm2qqv">An AI startup that lets anyone clone a target’s voice in a matter of seconds is being rapidly embraced by internet trolls. 4chan users have been flocking to free voice synthesis platform ElevenLabs, using the company’s tech to clone the voices of celebrities and read out audio ranging from memes and erotica to hatespeech and misinformation. </p>
<p id="6tDBLb">Such AI voice deepfakes have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22672123/ai-voice-clone-synthesis-deepfake-applications-vergecast">improved rapidly over the past few years</a>, but ElevenLabs’ software, which seems to have opened up general access over the weekend, offers a potent combination of speed, quality, and availability — as well as a complete lack of safeguards. </p>

  <p id="kP289L">Logitech, perhaps known best for its personal computer accessories like the webcam I have used (and loved!) for nearly every workday for three years, is revealing an ambitious new prototype on Tuesday: an elaborately designed video chat booth it calls “Project Ghost” that’s designed to be a better space to have virtual conversations.</p>
<p id="AGJAVo">I understand if that description might make you think of Google’s Project Starline, another conceptual<strong> </strong>video chat booth. When Logitech first told me about Project Ghost, that’s where my mind went. And the core idea is similar: you’ll be able to sit in a booth and talk to a lifelike projection of another person who is in another place in a way that approximates an in-person conversation.</p>

  <p id="1rX0w2">Sony has reportedly reduced sales projections for the launch of the PlayStation VR2 after receiving fewer preorders than expected for the new virtual reality headset. As reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-31/sony-playstation-vr2-headset-pre-order-disappointment-leads-to-production-cut"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the Tokyo-based tech giant is allegedly halving its quarterly shipment forecast from two million units down to a million units in the run-up to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/2/23436550/sony-playstation-vr2-release-date-price-features-games">PSVR2’s release on February 22nd</a>.</p>
<p id="lbS7C4">PSVR2 preorders first went live back in November last year, but many stores continue to take orders without a waitlist despite the product’s launch date being less than a month away — a stark contrast compared to the launch of hardware like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440721/sony-ps5-pre-orders-day-one-mess">PlayStation 5</a> or the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21541535/oculus-quest-2-preorders-sales-developers-zuckerberg">Meta Quest 2</a> which struggled to cope with high consumer demand. </p>

In an internal memo, CEO Bob Bakish announced the company’s rebranding its Showtime channel as Paramount Plus with Showtime.</p>
<p id="mjFkY9">Paramount confirmed the change in <a href="https://twitter.com/paramountco/status/1620194548151361536?s=20&amp;t=Hclr8zqN_f9vRLGzwB_R4Q">a post on Twitter</a>, noting that the merger is “the natural next step in our evolution.” The company’s also planning to carry over “select” original content from Paramount Plus to the TV network, which could include shows like <em>Halo</em> and <em>Yellowstone </em>spinoff <em>1923</em>.</p>
<p id="Xc5F9S">Bakish says the move “brings uncertainty for the teams working on these brands and businesses” and that he’ll share more details in “the coming weeks.” </p>
