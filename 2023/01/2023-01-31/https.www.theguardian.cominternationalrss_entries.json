The Utah-based congregation, known for unveiling some of the most exciting and influential independent films over the last few decades, had made an inevitable retreat online because of the pandemic but this year saw a much-hyped return to in-person premieres (with a reduced digital component still), a major test for organisers and the industry at large.</p><p>So once again, the ski destination of Park City was teeming with Hollywood types, showing films and making deals, the festival traditionally viewed as a major marketplace, untethered properties leading to frenzied bidding wars. But while there was an increase in films and buzzy market titles, there was a notable decrease in A-listers. Stars such as Jennifer Aniston, Michelle Williams, Viola Davis, Paul Rudd, Keira Knightley, Steve Carell, Angelina Jolie, Scarlett Johansson and Jennifer Lopez have all donned beanies and headed to the mountains with new films in the past but this year was more subdued. Sundance, founded in 1978 as a home for daring and innovative independent films existing outside of the mainstream, had raised eyebrows over some of its recent scheduling decisions, such as opening the 2020 festival with Netflix\u2019s Taylor Swift documentary, arguably the furthest it could get from its mission statement. The streamer had started to dominate the festival in recent years, using it as a way to build hype for in-house films, but it was also notably quiet this year going in, another sign of a festival returning to its roots.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/31/hits-misses-and-deals-what-can-we-learn-from-this-years-sundance\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/31/liz-truss-conservative-growth-group-westminster", "title": "Liz Truss\u2019s growth agenda still haunting the corridors of Westminster", "date_published": "2023-01-31 20:08:01+00:00", "description": "<p>Conservative Growth Group rises out of ashes of shortest-serving PM\u2019s tenure, but Truss herself is keeping a low profile publicly</p><p>Political rehabilitation is a gruelling exercise: no more so than for Liz Truss, who was consigned to the history books as Britain\u2019s shortest-serving prime minister having shattered the Conservatives\u2019 mantel for careful stewardship of the economy.</p><p>But she is persisting, once again stalking the corridors of Westminster and keen to ensure her fiery campaign to \u201cgo for growth\u201d does not tank like the markets did in response to the mini-budget last September.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/31/liz-truss-conservative-growth-group-westminster\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/31/epa-blocks-alaska-mine-win-for-environmentalists", "title": "EPA vetoes Alaska mine to protect salmon in win for environmentalists", "date_published": "2023-01-31 18:53:05+00:00", "description": "<p>Move is a victory for the environment, economy and tribes of Alaska\u2019s Bristol Bay region, and is \u2018victory for science over politics\u2019</p><p>The US Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday in effect vetoed a proposed copper and gold mine in a remote region of south-west Alaska that is coveted by mining interests but that also supports the world\u2019s <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/business-alaska-fish-salmon-us-environmental-protection-agency-286968406aa8ebaff624ae3217d6884d\">largest sockeye salmon fishery</a>.</p><p>The move by the agency, heralded by Alaska Native tribes and environmentalists who have <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/business-alaska-us-environmental-protection-agency-congress-climate-and-environment-c56106641c9fe76494dc2fb10e0bda2b\">long pushed for it</a>, deals a potentially devastating blow to the proposed Pebble mine and comes while an earlier rejection of a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/alaska-fish-us-news-salmon-ae56d13668374533f5118815114c40dc\">key federal permit</a> for the project remains unresolved.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/31/epa-blocks-alaska-mine-win-for-environmentalists\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jan/31/less-clumpy-universe-may-suggest-existence-of-mysterious-forces", "title": "\u2018Less clumpy\u2019 universe may suggest existence of mysterious forces", "date_published": "2023-01-31 18:22:23+00:00", "description": "<p>Survey could mean there is a crucial component missing from so-called standard model of physics</p><p>One of the most precise surveys of the structure of the universe has suggested it is \u201cless clumpy\u201d than expected, in findings that could indicate the existence of mysterious forces at work.</p><p>The observations by the <a href=\"https://news.uchicago.edu/story/dark-energy-survey-releases-most-precise-look-yet-universes-evolution\">Dark Energy Survey</a> and the <a href=\"https://news.uchicago.edu/story/next-gen-camera-south-pole-telescope-takes-data-early-universe\">South Pole Telescope</a><em> </em>chart the distribution of matter with the aim of understanding the competing forces that shaped the evolution of the universe and govern its ultimate fate.
