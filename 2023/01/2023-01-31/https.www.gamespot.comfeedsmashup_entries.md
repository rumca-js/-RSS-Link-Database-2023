These are Xbox 360 games.</p><p>The removals will begin on February 7, 2023, Microsoft said in an <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/xbox-360/store/xbox-360-marketplace-update">Xbox Support page</a> spotted by <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1620495570879279105">Wario64 on Twitter</a>.

<p>After an uneven couple of years trying to build the next big cinematic universe, Warner Bros. is essentially hitting the reset key on the DC Universe and starting over from scratch with a small but focused slate of films and TV projects. Led by Co-Chairmen and CEOs of DC Studios, James Gunn and Peter Safran, the first ten DC Studios projects--five movies and five HBO Max TV series--are all set in the same universe and will see comic book icons star alongside a squad lesser-known anti-heroes, a con artist from the future, intergalactic cops, and Gotham's best vigilantes.</p><p>Matt Reeves will return to his Caped Crusader with a sequel to The Batman, and as previously announced, director Todd Phillips is reuniting with Joaquin Phoenix for Joker: Folie à Deux. These two films will be set in an Elseworlds continuity, existing outside of the bubble of the main continuity. "The DCU's a multiverse, but we’re going to be focusing on one universe from that multiverse," Safran explained via the <a href="https://www.dc.com/blog/2023/01/31/the-next-generation-of-dc-movies-and-tv-has-arrived">DC website</a>. "And if something isn't DCU, we're going to make that very clear. So, strictly adult fare like Todd Phillips' Joker, or kids animation like Teen Titans Go, we’re going to make it very clear that those are DC Elseworlds, just the same way that they do it in the comic books."</p><figure style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4093562-dcuniverse.jpg"><img alt="The new DC Universe" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4093562-dcuniverse.jpg" /></a><figcaption>The new DC Universe</figcaption></figure><p>While Superman and Batman are familiar faces who'll headline their own films, Gunn said the creative teams he's been working with are looking to shine a light on more obscure corners of the DC Universe. "Here at DC, we have Metropolis, Gotham, Themyscira, Atlantis, Bialya… This is the world that we’re creating," Gunn said. "We’re coming into a world where superheroes exist and have existed for some time in one form or another, and that's the universe. We are telling a big, huge central story that is like Marvel, except that I think we're a lot more planned out than Marvel from the beginning because we've gotten a group of writers together to work the story out completely."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dc-studios-announces-10-new-movies-and-tv-shows-prepare-for-chapter-1-gods-monsters/1100-6511036/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Fire Emblem Engage - Best Emblem And Class Combinations

<p>In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fire-emblem-engage/">Fire Emblem Engage</a>, you can pair your units with the Divine Rings, each containing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fire-emblem-engage-all-legacy-characters-explained/2900-4613/">Fire Emblem hero from past games</a>. There are no restrictions on this system, allowing you to equip the rings to any unit you want, creating some interesting and powerful combinations. While experimentation is a great way to discover new powerful pairs, here are a few of the best classes to match with each Divine Ring in Fire Emblem Engage. <strong>Since you can change your units into different classes, the recommendations won't include specific characters, but specific classes.</strong></p><h2 dir="ltr">Marth</h2><p dir="ltr">Marth is a sword wielder himself and many of his skills benefit sword wielders, both the inherited kind and the kind you get for having him paired with a unit. While any unit paired with Marth would gain his sword proficiency and be able to use one, his skills best match up with someone who is already great with a sword. This includes units like <strong>Divine Dragon, Swordmaster, Hero, Great Knight, Wolf Knight, and Successeur</strong>.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Celica</h2><p dir="ltr">Celica is a magic wielder, with her skills providing additional magic power and extra agility when wielding a tomb. Naturally, this means the Celica is best paired up with a magic-wielding class like <strong>Vidame, Sage, Mage Knight, and High Priest</strong>. Additionally, if you have a character with a high magic stat but no magic proficiency in their class, pairing them with Celica would allow them to wield tombs.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fire-emblem-engage-best-emblem-and-class-combinations/1100-6511040/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

One quest in particular tasks you with scanning a player with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-falcon-scout-explained-and-how-to-get-it/1100-6510653/">Falcon Scout</a> and collecting their schematic. In this guide, we'll tell you how to make that happen.</p><h2>How to scan players with a Falcon Scout and collect their schematic in Fortnite</h2><p>The first step to scanning players with a Falcon Scout will be, of course, finding and equipping one. These mechanical birds can be found on the ground, in chests, or in supply drops. If you want a higher chance of getting one, though, you'll want to land places that contain <a href="https://www.theloadout.com/fortnite/oathbound-chests">Oathbound Chests</a>, which includes anywhere on the map that has an autumn aesthetic (largely to the west and southeast sections of the map). You can also buy one from Rebel, the 18th NPC on the island this season, for 250 bars.</p><figure style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4087883-falcon-2.jpg"><img alt="Use the Falcon Scout to scan a nearby enemy, then grab the schematic they drop." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4087883-falcon-2.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Use the Falcon Scout to scan a nearby enemy, then grab the schematic they drop.</figcaption></figure><p>When you've found a Falcon Scout, get near an enemy and hide out somewhere, then use the scout. When you gain control of the bird, fly it near the enemy and use your scan ability to ping their location. Doing so will not only give you the ability to see them through obstacles for a short while, but it'll also cause them to drop a schematic on the ground during this particular quest.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-how-to-scan-players-with-a-falcon-scout-and-collect-their-schematic/1100-6511039/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Overwatch 2 Hero-Based Progression System Is In The Works

<p>A hero-based progression system for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/">Overwatch 2</a> is currently in the works. It's just one way Blizzard is looking to address feedback from players surrounding the game's second season, as detailed in a new Season 2 retrospective <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/23910163/">blog post</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard states it wants to make Overwatch 2 feel more rewarding. One way the game will do that is with a new hero-based progression system, which will "showcase the energy players put into playing each hero and mastering their different abilities." Unfortunately, that's about all there is in regards to details on the new system, with Blizzard noting that design work has begun on the system and that it is still in early stages of development.</p><p dir="ltr">Another way Blizzard will look to make Overwatch 2 more rewarding is allowing players to once again earn Legacy Credits come Season 3's launch. Credits have been unearnable since the launch of Overwatch 2, but moving forward, Blizzard will give out up to 1,500 Credits as part of the game's free battle pass, with an additional 500 Credits available to be earned for those who purchase the premium battle pass. Going hand-in-hand with this change is that "nearly" all epic and legendary skins from Overwatch 1 will be earnable year round, including seasonal event skins. The price of these skins will be lowered to 1,500 Coins or Credits.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-hero-based-progression-system-is-in-the-works/1100-6511034/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>It's that time of the Destiny 2 seasonal cycle where things are a bit more relaxed. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-season-of-the-seraph-guides-season-pass-gear-exotics/1100-6509713/">Season of the Seraph</a> is still active, but at this point in the season, there are only a handful of objectives to check off of your list.</p><p>For this week, there's definitely not that much to do. Iron Banner is back, but the focus with these seasonal objectives makes for some easy XP and Bright Dust gains. Simply focus on dealing Void and Stasis damage through your weapons or classes, keep a machine gun equipped, and cycle through Heist Battlegrounds to knock several challenges off in one go.</p><p>You can also tackle seasonal challenges at your own pace, as they'll only expire once the season concludes in February. If you decide to take a break from Destiny 2, you can always return and complete multiple challenges at the same time after a few weeks of rest.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-season-of-the-seraph-seasonal-challenges-guide-week-9/1100-6509714/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Co-CEO of DC Studios James Gunn announced Paradise Lost, a live-action television show about the Amazons of Themyscira aka Paradise Island, as part of the upcoming DC Universe slate. In a video describing upcoming film and television projects for the DCU, Gunn described Paradise Lost, "It's almost like Game of Thrones... but with all the inhabitants of Paradise Island."</p><p>Via this description the show will be a mystical drama, with massive battles and political intrigue. Themyscria has been a setting in live action DC films before, like in Wonder Woman and both versions of Justice League. Whether any of the actors who played Amazons in those films will return is unknown. It is also unclear what era the show takes place in, though the description would imply that the show takes place before most DCU projects.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Here are just a few of our plans.

<p>DC Studio co-head James Gunn has commented on the situation surrounding actor Henry Cavill and how he will not be returning to play Superman in the next film, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/superman-legacy-movie-announced-in-new-dc-slate/1100-6511015/">Superman Legacy</a>. At an event attended by <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/james-gunn-unveils-dc-slate-batman-superman-1235314176/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Gunn said Cavill was not the right fit for the story Gunn wanted to tell with the next Superman film.</p><p>"We didn't fire Henry. Henry was never cast," Gunn said. "For me, it's about who do I want to cast as Superman and who do the filmmakers we have want to cast. And for me, for this story, it isn't Henry."</p><p>Gunn said he is a fan of Cavill's and believes he is a "great guy." But unfortunately for Cavill, Gunn said the actor is getting "dicked around by a lot of people," including people who were formerly in charge of the DC movie universe. "But this Superman is not Henry, for a number of reasons," Gunn said.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/henry-cavill-was-not-fired-from-new-superman-movie-because-he-was-never-cast/1100-6511027/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The DC Universe is getting a reboot, with a huge slate of new movies and TV shows announced from co-chiefs Peter Safran and James Gunn.

<p>James Gunn and DC have unveiled their first big steps for the rebooted DC Universe (DCU) that will unfold across the next several years. But not every series is getting reset. Both The Batman 2 and Joker 2, according to Gunn, will continue and be clearly labeled as "DC Elseworlds." This allows DC to both reboot and reconnect its many sometimes disparate franchises while also still giving the necessary breathing room to some of its big successes in recent years.</p><p>In a video shared to Twitter, Gunn also named Teen Titans Go as another such Elseworlds project, and it may stand to reason that more will come to fruition in the future, though Gunn stressed that bringing the many heroes and villains under one proverbial roof is to be the focus.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Here are just a few of our plans.

It will help establish the new DCU, but it won't be a Superman origin story. Instead, Safran says, it will focus on Superman "balancing his Kryptonian heritage with his human upbringing." He also noted that the spirit of the film will be optimistic, saying that Superman is "kindness in a world that thinks of kindness as old-fashioned."</p><p>Right now Gunn is only attached to write, but Safran says he hopes Gunn "can be persuaded" to direct as well. (Gunn was next to Safran for this comment, but did not comment further.)</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/superman-legacy-movie-announced-in-new-dc-slate/1100-6511015/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

For almost 20 years, we've had Batman solo adventures, but that cycle breaks with Brave and The Bold, a Bat-family movie.</p><p>The new movie will feature a new Batman actor and for the first time since 1995, Robin, leaping to the big screen, but the boy behind the wonder this time around will be Batman's own son, Damien.</p><p>"It's a very strange sort of father-son story about the two of them," Gunn said, explaining that this Robin is definitely a murderer, which goes against everything that Batman stands for in his war against crime.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-gunn-announces-new-batman-movie-the-brave-and-the-bold/1100-6511018/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Destiny 2: Lightfall Trailer Shows Off New And Deadly Exotics

<p>Destiny 2's upcoming Lightfall expansion looks set to introduce some massive changes to the sci-fi sandbox, but if there's one constant in that game, it's that even the most powerful of primordial cosmic forces are no match for a gun. In a new trailer for Lightfall, Bungie has shown off some of the weaponry that you'll be able to wield. These range from new Exotic weapons built using the unique technologies of Neomuna to new armor pieces that amplify the powers of the new Strand subclass.</p><div>          </div><p>Similarly to Beyond Light when the Stasis subclass was introduced, a number of these weapons will have Strand-energy attributes. Final Warning is a Strand sidearm that fires seeker rounds and Abeyant Leap is Exotic leg armor for Titans that unleashes a swarm of seeking projectiles when a Barricade is activated. Warlocks can create a threadling to infest and attack enemies after destroying a tangle generated from their Strand abilities using the Exotic leg armor Swarmers. According to Bungie, tangles can be used by players using Strand to weave objects and creatures, or for other purposes tied to weapons.</p><p>Another weapon that looks terrific is the Stasis glaive Winterbite. This melee tool can freeze enemies on impact with frost orbs and leave them vulnerable to a follow-up attack. Void fans can use Deterministic Chaos to rhythmically weaken enemies, and Cyrtarachne's Facade gives Hunters extra protection and enhanced flinch resistance when they use their grapple ability.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lightfall-trailer-shows-off-new-and-deadly-exotics/1100-6510998/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Weak PS VR2 Preorders Leads To Large Production Cut - Report

<p dir="ltr">Sony's PS VR2 is launching soon, but it seems that the company is already tamping down expectations for its new VR headset. According to a new <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-31/sony-playstation-vr2-headset-pre-order-disappointment-leads-to-production-cut">Bloomberg report</a>, Sony has reduced sales projections by half for PS VR2, which releases on February 22, primarily due to preorders falling short of expectations.</p><p dir="ltr">The report suggests that Sony planned to have 2 million headsets ready for consumers this quarter, but has now reduced that production run to 1 million. It further states that Sony expects for ship around 1.5 million from April 2023 to March of 2024, but that those numbers may be adjusted upward or downward in response to demand.</p><p dir="ltr">The report also notes that most stores are still taking PS VR2 preorders without a wait list, which is not usually the case with in-demand tech items in 2023. Several analysts reviewed for the piece said that the headset's price of $549 is unattractive to consumers, especially at a time when the cost of living has increased in recent months.

<p dir="ltr">If you teared up during the third episode of HBO's The Last of Us, imagine experiencing 45 more minutes of waterworks from Bill and Frank's story. That's what happened to showrunner Craig Mazin when he watched the first director's cut of Sunday's installment of the show, titled Long, Long Time.</p><p dir="ltr">Mazin, who wrote the third episode, chatted with <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/01/the-last-us-interview-neil-druckmann-craig-mazin-nick-offerman-murray-bartlett-pedro-pascal-1235242560/">Deadline</a> about creating Bill and Frank's story with director Peter Hoar. Mazin explained that he knew the cast and crew nailed it after initially watching a two-hour cut of the episode for what ultimately got sliced down to 73 minutes.</p><p dir="ltr">"When they sent it to me, I think it was almost two hours or something like that," Mazin said. "So, I was like, oh, that's probably not good. And I sat down, but I'm like, 'OK, I'll watch the two-hour version of this episode.' And I cried so hard that at one point, I actually said out loud, 'Ow.' I mean, it hurt. I cried so hard; it hurt. And I thought, 'Well, if these guys can do this to me and I wrote this f**king thing, then I think it might work pretty well on other people."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/there-was-a-2-hour-cut-of-hbos-tlou-episode-3-i-cried-so-hard-it-hurt/1100-6511001/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Showtime Will Be Officially Renamed "Paramount+ With Showtime"

<p dir="ltr">Sorry, Showtime fans--one of the original titans of premium pay TV is no longer its own standalone service. Parent company Paramount announced this week that Showtime will now be integrated into the premium tier of the Paramount+ streaming service. The two-for-one service will be known by the catchy title "Paramount+ with Showtime," which was previously the name of a duo streaming bundle that included both services.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/showtime-renamed-paramount-plus-with-showtime-1235506843/">Variety</a>, this changeover will happen later in 2023. In a memo to staff, Paramount CEO Bob Bakish told employees that the rebrand would help the company "leverage our entire collection of content to drive deeper connections with consumers" as well as "driving stronger alignment across our domestic and international Paramount+ offerings." He further notes that international Paramount+ already includes Showtime under its umbrella.</p><p dir="ltr">The memo also suggests that cost-cutting measures will accompany the move, with Paramount "diverting investment" away from areas that "account for less than 10% of our views." Variety reports that at least one completed series that was set to debut on Showtime is offered to other platforms, hoping for a new deal. As Variety notes, it's likely that fears of a looming recession contributed to this move, with the hopes that the two merged services will lead to better operation efficiencies for the company overall.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/showtime-will-be-officially-renamed-paramount-with-showtime/1100-6510996/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
