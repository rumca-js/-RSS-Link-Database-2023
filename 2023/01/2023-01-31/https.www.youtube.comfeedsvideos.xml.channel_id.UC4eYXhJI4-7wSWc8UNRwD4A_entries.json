The brothers have roots in both Switzerland and Ecuador, and the time spent in those two very distinct cultures and geographies gives their sound a tempered European coolness, coupled with a warm, playful energy. From the opening strains of \u201cEl Bueno Y El Malo\u201d the brothers\u2019 turn behind the Desk is the perfect introduction to their music if you don\u2019t already know them \u2014 and a treat if you already do.\n\nThey weave intricate guitar lines over each other that intertwine to the point that if you close your eyes you can\u2019t tell where one begins and the other ends. With a slight touch of a digital loop pedal, Estevan even sneaks in an entire percussion section on bongo and cowbell on \u201cTres Hermanos.\u201d When my Alt.Latino co-host Anamaria Sayre and I interviewed them on the  podcast last year, I notice that they converse very much like they play: their comments intertwine and layer upon each other\u2019s in the same way they play in unison and against each other in songs like \u201cThunderbird\u201d and \u201cPueblo Man.\u201d \n\nSET LIST\n\u201cEl Bueno Y El Malo\u201d\n\u201cTres Hermanos\u201d\n\u201cThunderbird\u201d\n\u201cPueblo Man\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nAlejandro Guti\u00e9rrez: guitar, lap steel\nEstevan Guti\u00e9rrez: guitar, percussion\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nDirector/Editor: Kara Frame\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Maia Stern, Sofia Seidel\nAudio Assistant: Brian Jarboe\nProduction Assistant: Jill Britton\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Ashley Pointer\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #hermanosgutierrez", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDFY4vN8Xc", "title": "Noura Mint Seymali: Tiny Desk Meets globalFEST 2023", "date_published": "2023-01-31 01:00:18+00:00", "description": "For the third year, Tiny Desk concerts team up with globalFEST for a thrilling online music festival \u2014 Tiny Desk meets globalFEST.\n\nBob Boilen | January 30, 2023\nHosted by Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo, the series echoes globalFEST\u2019s live flagship event in spirit but is centered in the framework of the Tiny Desk concert series.
