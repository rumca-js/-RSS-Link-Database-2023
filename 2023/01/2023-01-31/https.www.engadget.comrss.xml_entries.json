Rode claims the 40mm dynamic drivers are designed for accurate frequency response with minimal distortion. The NTH-100M might be your pick if you want a neutral sound for editing podcasts and videos.

It\u2019s still portable enough to chuck into a backpack, but has an IP67 rating, 20+ hours runtime at mid-volume, dual woofers and tweeters pushing out 50-watts of 360-degree sound and moves into the bassier 50hz to 20kHz frequency range. It\u2019s available in black starting today and priced at $299.</p><p>The Middleton is being pitched as the new flagship for Marshall\u2019s portable Bluetooth speaker line and rightly so. Aside from the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-portable-bluetooth-speakers-133004551.html\">Tufton</a>, which isn\u2019t all that rugged and is significantly bigger, the Middleton is now one of the more powerful portables in the company\u2019s stable. It\u2019s the largest IP67 rated speaker they have on offer, measuring 4.3 x 9 x 3.75 inches, and one of the first to pump out sound from all four sides. It also ditches the rubber port stopper seen on other models, since the company has already waterproofed the components.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>As mentioned, the Middleton is rated for more than 20 hours of playtime on a single charge, at low to mid volume of course. I haven't had the chance to test this on full blast for long periods of time, but the charge does seem to hold up well. The speaker has three battery cells totaling 9,600mAh, and you can use the speaker as a USB-C power bank if needed. Also, if your charge is running low while you're jamming out, you can always use it while its charging.</p><p>The 360-degree sound is driven by two 15-watt woofers, two 10-watt tweeters and a pair of passive radiators that serve to pump music out of the smaller ends of this chunky rectangle. The output from this four-pound device is respectable and it handles low frequencies well. You also get the trademark Marshall sound that gives you a good dynamic range and provides significant depth to whatever sounds you're vibing on.</p><p>Just like the Emberton and Willen, the Middleton has a soft-touch exterior composed of 55-percent post-consumer recycled plastic and is 100-percent PVC free. It also has a carry strap you can easily fit your hand through. On the top, you\u2019ll find onboard controls that provide more hands-on adjustment than its siblings. There\u2019s a Bluetooth button (which doubles as the Stack Mode control) and a multi-use joystick for power on/off, volume control and track selection (forward or back). You also get bass and treble controls, which are a welcome addition and a first for one Marshall\u2019s speakers without physical knobs. The level indicator works in conjunction with most of the above. It displays battery level, but also indicates volume, bass and treble levels all with backlit red lighting.</p><p>This speaker is also the biggest model to support Marshall\u2019s Stack Mode feature. You can start a session using the Marshall Bluetooth app and pair with any other Middleton, Emberton II or Willen speakers using a double press of their Bluetooth buttons to join. It helps if you aren\u2019t already paired with speakers joining the session. Like most Bluetooth portables, two (or more) sound much better than one and a double dose of the Middleton sound is a pleasure. The company claims you can pair a good deal of compatible speakers together, having tested up to 60 at one time. I've &quot;stacked&quot; two Middletons, an Emberton II and a Willen which worked well \u2014 once I unpaired all but the main speaker from my phone, that is.</p><p>For reference, the UE Megaboom 3 (<a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9VbHRpbWF0ZS1FYXJzLU1FR0FCT09NLUJsdWV0b290aC1XYXRlcnByb29mL2RwL0IwN0REM1cxNTQ_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8taXYtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImM4ZGRkZjQxLTY5NDEtNDM1My05MWU1LWYxNWVmNTI5OTAwYyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAWWOdF-_vDC55bMlAUxv5_bQgue0qgJP2CrCXmwSDUw0&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FUltimate-Ears-MEGABOOM-Bluetooth-Waterproof%2Fdp%2FB07DD3W154\">$199</a>) is a good model for comparison in terms of scale, although it's been around for several years.

Music didn\u2019t stop you seeing, but it was taking up some tangible mental resources. But what if you had a way to immediately make the music more calming? Or to change that distracting string section? That, effectively, is the promise of Aimi\u2019s interactive music player app. It won\u2019t help you find a parking spot, though, you\u2019re on your own with that.</p><p>If the name Aimi sounds familiar, that\u2019s because its self-described \u201cgenerative music platform\u201d has been <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai-music-app-aimi-endless-playlists-130043129.html\">available online</a> for a while. What\u2019s new is the mobile app, launching in beta today with <a href=\"https://www.aimi.fm/app/beta\">5,000 slots open globally</a>. The mobile experience takes the endless mood-based music feeds from the Aimi website and adds the option to tweak them to your heart\u2019s content. It\u2019s not a full-bore music making app, more of a tailored soundtrack for when you want a certain vibe, or as Aimi calls them: Experiences. The basic app will be free, but unlocking the majority of those controls will cost $10 a month.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The app offers experiences with names such as Serenity, Flow, Electronica and Push. Each gives a clear hint at what the vibe is and there are 10 of them at launch. The slowest, Serenity, starts at 64 BPM and they ratchet up to Push\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/EDM/comments/3fr82n/discussion_why_128_bpm/\">time-honored</a> throb of <a href=\"https://djtechreviews.com/dj-tips/why-are-so-many-songs-128-bpm\">128 BPM</a>.</p><p>As a listener, you could just open one of the experiences, tap play and go about your business. The idea being that if what the app serves you up isn\u2019t quite what you wanted, you can mash the shuffle button and it\u2019ll reconfigure the track with new sounds and energy. Or maybe you liked it, so there\u2019s a thumbs-up option to tell it \u201cmore of this please.\u201d That\u2019s the most basic use case, which is also the extent of the free tier \u2013 but you can take it a few steps further with a subscription.</p><div id=\"b13ed7dcce914c21865d3d12b0b95ea7\"></div><p>For premium users, once you have an experience playing, swiping left will give much more detailed control. The first screen shows a cluster of circles, each one labeled after a musical part (Beats, FX, Bass and so on). Hold down one of these circles and, as long as it\u2019s active, it\u2019ll solo just that part. If you tap a circle, you\u2019ll enter a sub menu where you can adjust the volume of that part along with a shuffle option for just that element and more thumbs up/down.</p><p>If you swipe left one more time, you\u2019ll find a selection of sliders which can vary from experience to experience, but tend to include \u201cIntensity,\u201d \u201cProgression,\u201d \u201cVocals\u201d and \u201cTexture.\u201d It\u2019s here that you can tell the app to do things like add a little intensity, mix things up more often or deliver more/less vocals. The changes are usually quite subtle - it\u2019s more re-adjusting than remixing. These settings are remembered, too, so the next time you fire up that experience it\u2019ll be to your taste. Or, at least the taste you had the last time you listened to it.</p><p>All the music on offer here is of the electronic variety. And despite the relatively wide range of BPMs, there\u2019s definitely a thread that runs through them. That\u2019s to say, this isn\u2019t genre-hopping in the sense that you might want a Hip Hop vibe before moving over to some Indie and back to EDM. It\u2019s more like being at a large House club with different areas with different BPMs along with a few well-stocked chill out rooms.</p><p>According to the company, the musical loops in Aimi are created by a pool of over 150 artists including some big names like Carl Cox. Once the loops are fed into the platform, AI takes over to match the pitch, BPM and general vibe. Theoretically, you have an endless radio station of music you can interact with, and the library is set to keep growing over time. Let\u2019s hope that includes some other genres. Hip Hop and anything with a breakbeat would instantly provide a shot of different energy here, for example. Likewise, something on the more acoustic side of things would at least provide an option for those less into electronic music.</p><p>Generative music has seen an increase of interest in recent years as technology has developed enough to make it more fluid than just burping up clips that are in time and key. Mostly this has been focused on the headspace area, meditative apps, concentration soundtracks and so on. Aimi\u2019s main rivals here would include Endel ($15 a month) and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-23-the-science-behind-beats-to-study-to.html\">Brain.fm</a> ($7 a month).</p><p>While Aimi does occupy this space too, its emphasis on interactivity with its mood-based streams sets it apart. In fact, Aimi CEO, Edward Balassanian, sees it as a gateway for the musically curious. \u201cOne of the strengths of generative music is that we can use it to attract casual listeners with continuous music experiences and then introduce them to interactive music by letting them take ownership of their music experience.\u201d he told Engadget.</p><figure><img alt=\"Three screenshots of the Aimi music app side by side.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/d2eefd50-a0a1-11ed-8bd7-ddf8d7badf97\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Aimi</div></figure><p>This hints at a broader plan. Right now there\u2019s the linear player on <a href=\"http://aimi.fm/\">Aimi.fm</a> and the new interactive app launching today. In the future, there will also be Aimi Studio, which Balassanian says will be released this summer. \u201cOnce we get you hooked on interacting with music through our player, we want you to feel inspired to try making music using Aimi studio. Aimi studio will be offered in both basic and pro editions for everyone from aspiring amateurs to professionals.\u201d he added.</p><p>I\u2019m uncertain if this will appeal to users that use something like Note by Ableton or Maschine by Native Instruments. The actual amount of impact you can have on the music in Aimi is very limited as your effectively just giving nudges to the AI rather than being directly hands on. Likewise, the section of the app where you can solo parts isn\u2019t immediate, this means if you were hoping to remix on the fly DJ-style by cutting the bass and beats before dropping them back in on the next phrase, it\u2019s not really designed for that.</p><p>Likewise, sometimes you can find yourself distracted by the thing that\u2019s meant to help you focus. When I tried the \u201cFlow\u201d stream, the first \u201cidea\u201d it presented was actually a bit irritating to me, so it served the opposite purpose. Of course, I could shuffle it to something more agreeable, but the irony of being taken out of the moment, even if just temporarily, was not wasted on me.</p><p>To that end, it\u2019s hard to see where the interactive arm of Aimi excels, at least at launch. The genres, while varied, do overlap quite a bit. The control you have over the music is quite gentle in the scheme of things and feels more like fine-tuning than an actual creator tool. The core experience of listening to chill vibes is a great alternative to your tired Spotify playlist, but that part is free and has been available in some form for a while.</p><p>Balassanian says that even more experiences from more artists will be coming after launch and once the Studio app is released anyone will be able to make loops and upload them to the platform for users to enjoy. In the meantime, you can sign up for early beta access <a href=\"https://www.aimi.fm/app/beta\">here</a> and start configuring your own soundtrack today.</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/apple-homepod-review-2nd-generation-140040630.html?src=rss", "title": "Apple HomePod (2nd gen) review: A smarter smart speaker", "date_published": "2023-01-31 14:00:40+00:00", "description": "<p>When Apple debuted <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-13-apple-homepod-review.html\">the HomePod</a> in 2018, it was already late to the smart speaker game. Sure, the company has never been worried about tardiness, choosing instead to focus on being the best. Unfortunately, that wasn\u2019t the case with its first attempt. The HomePod sounded good, but lacked a lot of the basic functionality and voice assistant smarts the likes of Amazon and Google offered. Apple has spent the last five years improving both HomePod and HomePod mini, adding features like multi-room audio, multi-user support and an intercom tool.</p><p>In 2021, Apple <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-homepod-smart-speaker-014943611.html\">discontinued the original model</a> in favor of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-homepod-mini-review-140030652.html\">the $99 HomePod mini</a>. But now, the larger version is back with a familiar look, but lots of changes on the inside. Like the first, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-homepod-2023-announced-price-specs-141225333.html\">the new HomePod</a> (<a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3719d8d4-5edd-4817-998a-91f3229e7323&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Walmart&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNzE5ZDhkNC01ZWRkLTQ4MTctOTk4YS05MWYzMjI5ZTczMjMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FsbWFydC5jb20vaXAvQXBwbGUtSG9tZVBvZC0ybmQtR2VuZXJhdGlvbi1XaGl0ZS8yNjA4OTk1MjYwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkNzQ0YTJkNS05NTJiLTQ1YzUtYTYxMi1hMjA4ODE1NmI1M2YifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAeJ19Vv171FRsSRD3zpp0KRMApB5s0XeNqLCEKo2DLKP&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-HomePod-2nd-Generation-White%2F2608995260\">$299</a>) is best suited for those who\u2019ve committed to Apple\u2019s ecosystem. So if that\u2019s not you, I understand if you don\u2019t want to go any further. If it is, just know that the company has given its speaker a lot more tools than it had at launch five years ago, including more capable assistance from Siri and more smart home abilities. Plus, the second-generation HomePod is $50 cheaper.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h2><strong>A familiar design updated on the inside</strong></h2><p>If you were hoping for a wholesale redesign with the new HomePod, Apple undoubtedly disappointed you. However, there are some noticeable changes upon close inspection. First, the speaker\u2019s touch panel is now slightly recessed like the HomePod mini. On the original version, that panel sits flush with the top rim. When you trigger Siri, lighting for that panel now goes all the way to the edge too. Next, the power cord is now detachable. This means if you have an issue with that very necessary component, it should be easier to get a replacement (via Apple Care). If you have excellent vision, you might also be able to discern the 2023 model is 0.2-inches shorter at 6.6-inches tall (vs. 6.8 inches) if they\u2019re sitting side by side.</p><div id=\"a69874e0c3044121897aca0a246b4c43\"></div><p>On the inside though, Apple made a host of changes. Both versions have an upward facing woofer with a group of tweeters around the bottom. For the second-generation, Apple reduced the number of tweeters from seven to five, angling them slightly upward where previously they were almost perfectly side-firing. The company also cut the number of voice microphones from six down to four. And perhaps the most important change internally, Apple swapped the iPhone 6\u2019s A8 chip for the much more modern S7 \u2013 the silicon that powers the Apple Watch series 7.</p><h2><strong>Software and setup</strong></h2><p>Despite the lack of changes on the outside, the second-gen HomePod is a better speaker because Apple has been improving it and the HomePod mini over time. The company added <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-05-apple-homepod-in-stereo-multiroom-demo.html\">stereo pairing and multi-room audio</a> alongside AirPlay 2 a few months after launch of the first generation model. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-03-homepod-multiple-users.html\">Multi-user support and audio handoffs</a> were added in 2019 and the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ios-homepod-update-intercom-siri-maps-iphone-12-202035823.html\">intercom feature</a> arrived ahead of the HomePod mini in 2020. And in 2021, HomePod gained the ability to play <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-4k-homepod-tv-connected-audio-202408196.html\">any TV audio via an Apple TV 4K over eARC</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/homepod-mini-spatial-audio-apple-music-lossless-support-beta-210300048.html\">both spatial audio and Apple Music lossless streaming</a>. So many of the key features Apple is chatting up on the new HomePod are things it has been slowly adding since 2018. And many of which, I\u2019d argue, should\u2019ve been there from there from the start.</p><p>Everything you need to set up and control the HomePod is found in Apple\u2019s Home app. First, you\u2019ll need to add a new speaker like you would any other smart home device with this software, including assigning it a room or location in your home. The app allows you to set up Automations and Scenes along with configuring how you\u2019d like to interact with Siri.</p><figure><img alt=\"Apple Home app\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/c2371c90-a10a-11ed-b5fc-1306f4470b47\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>You have the ability to disable voice cues or the long press on the HomePod\u2019s touch panel in order to activate the assistant (both are enabled by default). You can also have the speaker light up and play a sound when using Siri \u2013 or do one or neither. The Home app will let you use Siri for Personal Requests too, where the speaker can recognize your voice for things like messages, calls and reminders so long as your iPhone is close by. The software allows you to disable the HomePod\u2019s intercom feature as well, should you prefer not to use that tool.</p><p>Like the first HomePod, the 2023 model is equipped with room calibration. This detects reflections off of walls and other surfaces to configure the sound for the best performance. The HomePod does this the first time you play music, but it isn\u2019t constant monitoring. Instead, like it did on the previous generation, the setup leverages an accelerometer to determine when it has been moved. If it has, the speaker will then reinitiate the room sensing process when music is played.</p><h2><strong>A smart home with Siri</strong></h2><figure><img alt=\"Apple HomePod (2nd gen) review\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/1a3c2400-a109-11ed-ac79-33a2389e9cf9\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>When we reviewed the original HomePod in 2018, one of our biggest gripes was with Siri\u2019s limited abilities. Sure the speaker sounded good, but the lack of polish with the voice assistant made it seem like a work in progress. Apple has done a lot to improve Siri over the last five years, so a lot of those issues with the original have been fixed.</p><p>First, the HomePod, like Siri on your iPhone, is capable of recognizing multiple users. Personal Requests can allow it to peek at your Calendar, Notes, Reminders, Messages, Find My and more when you ask. Plus, HomePod can give each member of your family (up to six people) their unique responses from certain iPhone apps. What\u2019s more, Siri can create recurring home automations without you having to pick up your phone and swipe over to the appropriate app.</p><p>Even with fewer microphones to pick up your voice, the new HomePod doesn\u2019t suffer any performance setbacks. It\u2019s just as capable as ever at picking out your voice even in a noisy room. And, while playing music with voice commands used to be limited to Apple Music, services like Pandora, Deezer and several others can now be controlled via Siri.</p><p>HomePod is also a smart home hub, easily pairing with HomeKit and Matter accessories. The new model is equipped with temperature and humidity sensing, and that info is displayed prominently in the Home app. Of course, you can use that data to create automations with other smart home devices. I don\u2019t have a compatible smart thermostat, but I was able to successfully trigger a smart plug once the HomePod detected a certain temperature in my living room.</p><p>Sound Recognition is arguably the most notable new feature that Apple is debuting with the new HomePod, but it\u2019s not ready yet. It can listen for smoke or carbon monoxide alarms and send a notification to an iPhone, iPad or Apple Watch. What\u2019s more, you\u2019ll be able to \u201ccheck in'' on what\u2019s happening via an audio feed or camera. Sound Recognition won\u2019t arrive until later this spring, so we\u2019ll have to wait to test it.</p><h2><strong>Sound quality</strong></h2><figure><img alt=\"Thanks to the work Apple has put in over the last five years, the second-gen HomePod is a much better smart speaker than its predecessor. The company has once again delivered stellar sound quality, though it can over emphasize vocals and dialog at times. However, expanded smart home tools and more room to grow shows Apple has learned from its stumbling first attempt. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/61b77751-a107-11ed-bff2-03180772f1c4\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Audio quality wasn\u2019t an issue with the first-gen HomePod and it\u2019s still great here. But like the first version, Apple\u2019s choice for tuning won\u2019t appease everyone. There\u2019s a continued emphasis on voice, so things like vocals in music or dialog on a TV show or movie take center stage. At times it\u2019s fine though, with some genres and content, it leads to a rather subpar experience.</p><p>Don\u2019t get me wrong, for the most part HomePod sounds outstanding, especially when you put it up against other smart speakers. The fact is many of those don\u2019t sound very good at all, so Apple continues its track record for making a device that has serious audio chops and smart features. <em>RTJ4 </em>has ample bass for its bombastic hip-hop beats while Sylvan Esso\u2019s <em>No Rules Sandy </em>gets enough low-end for its synth-heavy rhythms. Thanks to the HomePod\u2019s excellent clarity, detailed styles like bluegrass and jazz shine. Sometimes the bass is a little too subdued for metal (Underoath\u2019s <em>Voyuerist</em>) or full-band country (Zach Bryan\u2019s 2022 live album), and the vocals too forward, but overall, it sets the standard for smart speaker sound. And the HomePod only shines brighter as a stereo pair.</p><p>When you add the second HomePod in the Home app, the software asks you if you want to use them together. Once you tell it which side the additional unit is on (left or right), the app completes the setup for you, assigning the appropriate channel to each speaker. Now everywhere you previously saw a single HomePod icon, you\u2019ll see two, constantly reminding you of the stereo arrangement. The double speaker option is great for music.  On B\u00e9la Fleck\u2019s <em>My Bluegrass Heart</em>, the two-speaker arrangement adds a lot of dimensionality to each track. There was already a spatial element to the tunes, but dual HomePods heightens the sensation, making it seem like you\u2019re in the middle of the  musicians while they record each song.</p><figure><img alt=\"Thanks to the work Apple has put in over the last five years, the second-gen HomePod is a much better smart speaker than its predecessor.

Those aren\u2019t disabled just because you\u2019ve asked the streaming box to also send audio to a HomePod or two. TV audio with stereo pair is fine, but I can\u2019t see using a single unit for the same purpose. In a multi-room setup you might want to send the sound from a live event like the Super Bowl to a solo speaker, but having just one as your lone living room audio from a TV isn\u2019t a great experience. While the HomePod beams sound in all directions, with a single speaker it\u2019s clear the sound is coming from a fixed location \u2013 something that\u2019s a lot less noticeable with a pair or with a soundbar.</p><p>As is the case with vocals, dialog takes prominence with a HomePod and Apple TV. At times it can seem slightly muffled when watching things like live sports. Otherwise, there\u2019s good clarity, nice bass and great dimensional audio when streaming <em>Formula 1: Drive to Survive </em>or <em>Slow Horses</em>. But, honestly, if you\u2019re looking to improve your living room audio, a soundbar and sub is a better option. The driver arrangement in those speakers does a better job of filling a room completely and evenly.

If you'll recall, the Trump administration added the company <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-19-huawei-ceo-founder-ren-zhengfei-us-ban.html\">to the &quot;entity list,&quot;</a> making it ineligible from receiving exports from the US without a license. The US commerce department issued some companies like Qualcomm licenses to provide Huawei with American tech unrelated to 5G networks since then \u2014 Qualcomm, for instance, supplies Huawei with 4G chips for smartphones. But the government is reportedly looking to impose a total ban on the sale of American tech to the Chinese firm, and this expanded restriction is a step towards making that happen.&nbsp;</p><p>The US government adds companies to the entity list <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/06/24/2021-13395/addition-of-certain-entities-to-the-entity-list\">if it believes</a> they are involved in or &quot;pose a significant risk of being or becoming involved in, activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.&quot; It has previously accused Huawei of having deep ties with the Chinese government and warned allies that the 5G equipment it makes could be used to spy on other countries and companies. Huawei has repeatedly denied the accusation.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>It's not entirely clear why the US government is moving towards a total ban, if this report is indeed true, but the Biden administration seems to be taking a <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2022/12/02/biden-tougher-china-trump-former-morgan-stanley-chair-asia-stephen-roach/\">tougher stance on China</a> compared to its predecessor. Last year, it <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/arm-latest-chip-designs-china-us-uk-export-controls-100235667.html\">introduced new rules</a> that prohibit the export of powerful semiconductors that could be repurposed for military use, as well as chipmaking equipment, to China and Russia. One possible reason is that Huawei, <em>The Times</em> says, is backing projects that aim to build a semiconductor supply chain in its country that doesn't rely on imports. A former CIA official also told the publication that the government is probably looking to expand the existing export ban, because Huawei is a totally different company from when it was added to the entity list.</p><p>Huawei's focus back then was on 5G technology, but it has since changed gears to prioritize its enterprise and government businesses, including a cloud service, to survive the trade ban. Being added to the blacklist had a huge impact on Huawei's revenues in 2021, but company executive Eric Xu said the manufacturer was able to pull itself &quot;out of crisis mode&quot; in 2022 and expects to go back to &quot;business as usual&quot; this year. A total ban could very well put Huawei back into crisis mode, and it would likely affect the revenues of its US suppliers, as well. That said, the Chinese company might have some time to prepare, depending on when the export licenses that had already been issued will expire.</p><p>A commerce department spokesperson didn't confirm whether it has truly stopped issuing licenses to American firms, telling<em> The Times</em> that it &quot;continually assess[es] its policies and regulations.&quot; A source told <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-stops-provision-licences-export-chinas-huawei-ft-2023-01-30/\"><em>Reuters</em></a>, however, that US officials are in the midst of crafting new policies that would prohibit shipments to Huawei below the 5G level. The new restrictions would reportedly cover products and components related to 4G, WiFi 6 and 7, AI, as well as cloud and high-performance computing.&nbsp;</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/spotify-reaches-205-million-premium-subscribers-as-losses-mount-122503157.html?src=rss", "title": "Spotify reaches 205 million Premium subscribers as losses mount", "date_published": "2023-01-31 12:25:03+00:00", "description": "<p>Spotify just <a href=\"https://s29.q4cdn.com/175625835/files/doc_financials/2022/q4/Shareholder-Deck-Q4-2022-FINAL.pdf\">released</a> its Q4 earnings and announced that it now has 205 million premium subscribers, up 10 million from last quarter.

Well, it only took the internet a few days to start using the latter for vile purposes. The company has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elevenlabsio/status/1620032627075063811\">revealed on Twitter</a> that it's seeing an &quot;increasing number of voice cloning misuse cases&quot; and that it's thinking of a way to address the problem by &quot;implementing additional safeguards.&quot;</p><p>While ElevenLabs didn't elaborate on what it meant by &quot;misuse cases,&quot; <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy7mww/ai-voice-firm-4chan-celebrity-voices-emma-watson-joe-rogan-elevenlabs\"><em>Motherboard</em></a> found 4chan posts with clips featuring generated voices that sound like celebrities reading or saying something questionable. One clip, for instance, reportedly featured a voice that sounded like Emma Watson reading a part of Mein Kampf. Users also posted voice clips that feature homophobic, transphobic, violent and racist sentiments. It's not entirely clear if all the clips used ElevenLab's technology, but a post with a wide collection of the voice files on 4chan included a link to the startup's platform.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Perhaps this emergence of &quot;deepfake&quot; audio clips shouldn't come as a surprise, seeing as a few years ago, we'd seen a similar phenomenon take place. Advances in AI and machine learning had led to a rise in deepfake videos, specifically deepfake pornography, wherein existing pornographic materials are altered to use the faces of celebrities. And, yes, people used Emma Watson's face for some of those videos.&nbsp;</p><p>ElevenLabs is now gathering feedback on how to prevent users from abusing its technology. At the moment, its current ideas include adding more layers to its account verification to enable voice cloning, such as requiring users to enter payment info or an ID. It's also considering having users verify copyright ownership of the voice they want to clone, such as getting them to submit a sample with prompted text. Finally, the company is thinking of dropping its Voice Lab tool altogether and having users submit voice cloning requests that it has to manually verify.&nbsp;</p><div id=\"0797fde06ebc473685bdd0a0e7e47a74\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Crazy weekend - thank you to everyone for trying out our Beta platform.

The Korean tech giant has posted KRW 302.23 trillion (US$245.4 billion) in annual revenue, which is a new record high for the company, in its latest earnings report. But it has also reported an operating profit of KRW 43.38 trillion (US$35 billion) for all of 2022, down KRW 8.5 trillion (US$6.9 billion) <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-q4-2021-earnings-report-061144044.html\">from the year before</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;The business environment deteriorated significantly in the fourth quarter due to weak demand amid a global economic slowdown,&quot; the company explained. While the tech giant's Foundry business posted an increase in profit due to customer and application diversification, its semiconductor business performed poorly as a whole. There was weak demand for its chips overall, as customers adjust and reduce their inventory in the face of economic uncertainties. Its chips' prices also dropped, mostly likely due to a surplus in unsold inventory, contributing to the business' decline in earnings for the year.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>In the fourth quarter of 2022, Samsung's semiconductor business earned KRW 20.07 trillion (US$16.3 billion) in consolidated revenue but only KRW 0.27 trillion (US$219 million) in operating profit. For comparison, it posted a consolidated revenue of KRW 26.01 trillion (US$21.6 billion in early 2022's conversion rates) and an operating profit of KRW 8.84 trillion (US$7.35 billion) for Q4 2021. Samsung is bracing for this downward trend to persist throughout the next few months, though it expects demand for its semiconductors to pick up in the second half of the year.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, the demand for smartphones remained weak in the fourth quarter of 2022. Sales for Samsung's more affordable phones went down, and while flagship sales held up to market expectations, they're still lower than previous quarters'. The company expects demand for mass market smartphones to weaken even further in 2023 &quot;due to persistent macroeconomic conditions.&quot; But since it also expects demand for premium devices to stay solid, it vows to strengthen &quot;the competitiveness of its premium flagship products.&quot; To note, Samsung will <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-unpacked-2023-event-preview-galaxy-s23-160039754.html\">hold its first Unpacked event of 2023</a> on February 1st where it will most likely unveil its next flagship phone, the Galaxy S23.&nbsp;</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}], "source": {"url": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Engadget"}}
