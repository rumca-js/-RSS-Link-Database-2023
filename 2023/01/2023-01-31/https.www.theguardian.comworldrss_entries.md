<p>Ukraine planned to push for western fourth-generation fighter jets. Plus, why circadian-rhythm shaming needs to stop</p><p>Good morning.</p><p>Joe Biden said the US would not supply F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, in a brief exchange with reporters overnight, a significant and potentially terminal setback to Kyiv’s campaign to obtain the fast jets that had been rapidly gaining momentum.</p><p><strong>Why won’t the US send fighter jets?</strong> John Kirby, the US national security council coordinator for strategic communications, later defended the decision, highlighting the other military aid the US has sent since the war started, which has a total value of $27.1bn. “What I can tell you is that there’s a lot of capability that is being sent, and will be sent in the coming weeks and months,” Kirby told CNN.</p><p><strong>What’s happening with the case?</strong> The Department of Justice has charged Pelosi’s attacker, David DePape, with assault and attempted kidnapping. The 42-year-old also faces state charges including attempted murder. He has pleaded not guilty.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/31/first-thing-biden-says-us-will-not-provide-f-16-fighter-jets-to-ukraine">Continue reading...</a>
