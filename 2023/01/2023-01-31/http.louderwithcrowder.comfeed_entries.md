And for just $95, you, too, can experience the full socialist wrath of an 81-year-old twice-failed Presidential candidate. </p><p>The event is taking place on March 1st at The Anthem in Washington, D.C. His <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/667864/its-ok-to-be-angry-about-capitalism-by-bernie-sanders-with-john-nichols/" target="_blank">new book</a>, "It’s Okay to Be Angry About Capitalism," is "a progressive takedown of the uber-capitalist status quo that has enriched millionaires and billionaires at the expense of the working class, and a blueprint for what transformational change would actually look like." </p><p>"Sanders argues that unfettered capitalism is to blame for an unprecedented level of income and wealth inequality, is undermining our democracy, and is destroying our planet. How can we accept an economic order that allows three billionaires to control more wealth than the bottom half of our society? How can we accept a political system that allows the super-rich to buy elections and politicians?"</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cSen.

<p>Ironically, Bernie <a href="https://redstate.com/terichristoph/2023/01/30/itll-cost-you-95-to-hear-bernie-sanders-tell-you-why-capitalism-is-bad-n696189" target="_blank">received</a> generous sums of cash from uber-capitalist Big Tech companies during his 2020 campaign. Sanders raked in $963,943 from Alphabet, $781,837 from Amazon, $480,498 from Apple, and $430,804 from Microsoft. </p><p>This book tour could be signaling yet another Presidential run. Last year, a memo leaked to the Washington Post <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bernie-sanders-not-ruled-out" target="_blank">read,</a> "In the event of an open 2024 Democratic presidential primary, Sen. Sanders has not ruled out another run for president, so we advise that you answer any questions about 2024 with that in mind." So we may soon be 'Feeling the Bern' yet again. At least until they resuscitate Joe Biden enough to string three words together. </p><p>And in case you're wondering, yes, Bernie Sanders is in fact, a millionaire. Now pay him a hundred bucks so he can tell you how to stop being exploited by millionaires. </p><p><p>

## Stephen Curry claims low-income housing next to his $30M mansion is a safety risk, but next to YOUR house is okay

Fast-forward two years and now he's writing letters complaining about proposed low-income housing near his $30M mansion. I would say I'm shocked but I won't, because I'd be lying. </p><p>Curry and his wife Ayesha wrote a letter to the city of Atherton, California, complaining about plans for a 16-unit low-income housing property to be built near their residence. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cLiberal NBA Stephen Curry is opposing affordable housing next to his $30 million mansion, saying he has "major concerns" for his "privacy" and "safety."\n\nCurry joined a nonprofit in 2021 focused on "bridging the racial wealth gap.\u201d \n\nVia @BenDavisWilson \nhttps://t.co/ffc8nrbsJU\u201d</div> — Washington Free Beacon (@Washington Free Beacon)

<p>Part of the letter reads, "We hesitate to add to the 'not in our backyard' (literally) rhetoric, but we wanted to send a note before today's meeting. Safety and privacy for us and our kids continue to be our top priority and one of the biggest reasons we chose Atherton as home."</p><p>He goes on to ask the town to find a different location or install taller fences to keep the riff-raff out: "We kindly ask that the town adopts the new housing element without the inclusion of 23 Oakwood. Should that not be sufficient for the state, we ask that the town commits to investing in considerably taller fencing and landscaping to block sight lines onto our family's property."</p><p>What could have possibly led to the placement of low-income housing in well-off neighborhoods? Probably the policies of all the politicians Curry has very publicly supported in the past few years, plus the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/15/closing-racial-wealth-gap-nbas-steph-curry-joins-nonprofit-ninetytozero.html" target="_blank">nonprofit</a> he himself joined. Just a wild guess. </p><p>In 2019, Curry attended a town hall on racial equity with Obama. And in 2020, he even had his kids endorse Joe Biden for President. Because nothing screams authenticity like sitting your children in front of a camera to push a political agenda. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>This whole scenario is reminiscent of the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jonathan-turley-desantis-immigrant-lawsuit" target="_blank">Martha's Vineyard</a> fiasco, when Governor DeSantis flew illegal immigrants to the vacation homes of the elites who advocate for their entry to the U.S. They were promptly removed and sent to greener, more socio-economically appropriate pastures. It's almost like these lefties want to publicly advocate for these types of policies, but want nothing to do with the natural effects of those policies...weird. </p><p><p>

## New video shows what led to pro-life activist Mark Houck's arrest, and it's pretty underwhelming

The FACE Act makes it a federal crime to use force with the intent to injure, intimidate and interfere with anyone because that person produces reproductive health care. </p><p>Back in September, armed FBI agents arrived at Houck's home to arrest him for shoving a pro-abortion volunteer outside of a Planned Parenthood. For context, Houck is a Catholic father of 7 who regularly prays the rosary outside of Planned Parenthood.</p><p>Last night, Sean Hannity played the footage of the incident that led to his arrest. The pro-abortion volunteer, Bruce Love, can be seen heckling and verbally harassing Houck and his then-12-year-old son. Houck makes several failed attempts to diffuse the situation before he eventually shoves Love to the ground. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cBREAKING: Hannity just aired the footage of the incident between Mark Houck and the Planned Parenthood escort, who clearly walks down the road to where Houck and his son are praying and counseling to threaten them.\n\nThe Biden DOJ tried to put him in jail for 11 years for this.\u201d</div> — Greg Price (@Greg Price)

</blockquote>
<p>Initially, both the city police and defense attorney declined to file charges against Houck. Love then filed a private criminal complaint in Philadelphia municipal court, but the case was dismissed after Love repeatedly failed to show up in court. After all that, Houck suddenly received a letter from the Attorney General's Office stating that he was the target of a federal probe into the same incident. </p><p>After the verdict, Houck went outside to pray with his family and supporters. In his first public statement after his acquittal, he said, "I'm just so grateful for the men surrounding me [...] and my family, I'm George Bailey today." He said the first thing he was going to do was get some ice cream with his family. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>It's quite ironic how the Biden administration is <em>just now</em> getting around to investigating <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/msnbc-fbi-investigatin-abortion-attack" target="_blank">firebombed pregnancy centers</a>, but they wasted no time in going after a pro-life father. Maybe it's just another one of those funny coincidences. There seem to be a lot of those lately. </p><p><p>

## Supermodel honors late son by posing half-naked in his clothes and we have questions

Some turn to food, others exercise, and some do half-naked photoshoots in their deceased loved one's favorite clothing. </p><p>Ok actually, that last one is a one-off. Hopefully. </p><p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/victorias-secret-vs-colective" target="_blank">Supermodel</a> Stephanie Seymour tragically lost her son Harry to a drug overdose back in 2021. Harry was also renowned in the fashion industry and had one particularly treasured <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jordan-peterson-twitter-suit" target="_blank">suit</a>, a Saint Laurent by Hedi Slimane. Since the suit held such a special place in Harry's heart, Stephanie kept it hanging in her dressing room. </p><p>One night, while gazing upon the suit, Seymour thought to herself, "‘I’m going to put it on." And somehow it fit her. </p><p>After trying the suit on, Seymour naturally had to do a half-naked <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/madonna-vanity-fair" target="_blank">photoshoot</a> in said suit. In honor of her late son, of course. It only makes sense. </p><p>The shoot features a photo of Seymour from behind, donning her dead son's treasured suit pants while clutching the jacket against her bare chest. "Harry" is written in cursive on her back, along with a heart and arrow on her shoulder. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Nothing to see here. Completely normal behavior.

</blockquote>
<p>On the bright and more-normal side, Seymour said her grandchildren have immensely helped her deal with her grief. Her family just welcomed a new baby in October, and he was named after his late Uncle Harry. </p><p>Here's to hoping Stephanie leans a little more into wholesome family time and maybe a little less into half-naked photoshoots in her deceased child's clothing. It might just be better for everyone involved. </p><p><p>

<p>Jennifer Siebel Newsom <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2023/01/30/group-founded-gavin-newsoms-wife-teaches-kids-about-gender-roles-with-images-from-pornhub/" target="_blank">founded</a> The Representation Project in 2011. The group claims its goal is to combat sexism by distributing its curriculum and films to classrooms, and it's been successful in reaching 2.6 million students nationwide. </p><p>The questionable film is titled, "The Mask You Live In” and is allegedly for kids 15 years and older. I say "allegedly" because of the porn. Which is typically a no-no for schools in general. Then again, what do I know. I'm just a traditionalist, anti-porn-for-kids prude. </p><p>The film's reasoning for depicting sexually explicit images of nude women is to discuss the harm such images inflict on young boys. It does this by showing the harmful images to the young boys. Kinda like how in health class, they teach kids about the harms of cocaine by giving them cocaine. </p><p>Some of the "educational" scenes featured in the film include "two dirty brunettes dominated in the stables” and “girl next door manipulated and sexually dominated by kinky couple.” For education, of course.  No ulterior motives at all. Not a one. </p><p>Another film, titled "Miss Representation, was written and directed by Jennifer Newsom. This one is for middle schoolers and features half-naked ladies and a completely naked female doll hanging upside-down. Did I mention this is all <em>purely</em> educational? Nothing to see here. </p><p>Since 2012, the organization has made $1.7 million in sales from documentaries, and Jennifer Newsom has earned about $1.5 million in film licenses. Public schools have to pay between $50-$600 for the films and curriculum. </p><p>Before you gawk at that price, the curriculum also includes the beloved <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/its-come-to-this-the-genderbread-person-for-the-kids" target="_blank">Genderbread person</a> and teaches middle schoolers how to be activists. So for just $600 a pop, your local school can raise the next generation of nonbinary gender fluid queer mostly peaceful Antifa members. And that's a steal. Just like the businesses they'll one day loot. </p><p><p>

AirPORT freakouts <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/airport-drunk-woman-morotized-suitcase" target="_blank">are a different story</a>. But the odds of someone misbehaving 50000 feet in the sky were diminished. Thankfully for those of us who hustle content for a living, some dude broke up with his girlfriend mid-flight and she didn't handle the news as well as you would expect.</p><p>Is it nice that this happened and someone recorded it? No. Are these clicks going to bait themselves? Also no.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Karen?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Karen</a> screaming her lungs out mid flight.

</p><p>All the attention is being paid to the girl. You know, what with her not calming down and screaming like that one woman when Donald Trump was inaugurated. But I want to know what the dude was thinking. In the BEST CASE scenario you dump your girlfriend...then are stuck sitting next to her for the rest of the flight. Not to mention, that awkward time when the plane lands and everyone is standing up before the door opens.</p><p>Or maybe she goes <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mike-tyson-airplane" target="_blank">Mike Tyson on your ass</a>. And instead of laughing at her overreaction, we're laughing at you for getting beat up by a girl.</p><p>Thankfully for the dude who was updating his Tinder profile while his now ex-girlfriend was carrying on like a lunatic, all the attention is on the jilted lover. And a flight attendant who I could have sworn I heard told the crazy girl to "put her mask on" while she was screaming.</p><p><p>

## Watch: Tennis player shuts down woke reporter so hard, other athletes need to study her and take notes

<img src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32927541&amp;width=980" /><br /><br /><p>Way too many sports journalismers want to push their leftist politics rather than report on sports. Covering sports is barely a marginal concern. It's an easy soundbite. Ask an athlete for an opinion on politics they may or may not follow and twist what they say to fit your agenda. Tennis star Victoria Azarenka has better idea. Tell the reporter to suck it.</p><p>At issue is the Australian Open and a pro-Russia demonstration. Fellow tennis star Novak Djokovic's father was photographed with some of the pro-Russia protesters. Djokovic, as you know, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/us-open-white-house" target="_blank">can't play in America</a> even though he keeps winning tournaments <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/novak-djokovic-loses-deportation-appeal" target="_blank">because he won't get the schmaccine</a>. His dad was photographed talking to a Russian. Russia is at war with Ukraine. The story involves all the current things!</p><p>Except for tennis. Which is why Azarenka is there.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Lots of athletes are finally catching on that left wing sports media ask them political questions so the left wing sports media members can write their own left wing political opinions. Here’s Azarenka calling that out: <a href="https://t.co/w6DqNjPd4p">pic.twitter.com/w6DqNjPd4p</a><br />— Clay Travis (@ClayTravis) <a href="https://twitter.com/ClayTravis/status/1620274723283439618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 31, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>All athletes need to study and take notes. This part is key:</p><p>AZARENKA: Whatever the answer, I’m going to give it to you right now, it’s going to be turned whichever way you want to turn it to, [...] Are you a politician? Are you covering politics?</p><p>DOUCHEBAG JOURNALISMER: No, I’m a sports journalist.</p><p>AZARENKA: Yes. And I’m an athlete. And you’re asking me about things that maybe somebody says are in my control. But I don’t believe that. So I don’t know what you want me to answer. And if it’s a provocative question, then, you know, you can spin the story however you want.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="7edde" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32927747&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>It's not unlike Olympic weightlifting journalismers who asked the WINNING female competitors <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/laurel-hubbard-weightlifter-winner-response" target="_blank">how awesome it was to compete against Laurel Hubbard</a>, a competitor who didn't win diddly squat. All because Hubbard was...you know, "beautiful and brave." The WINNING female athletes said no comment and let the awkward silence speak for itself.</p><p>Athletes not only need to be trained to play their sport. They need to be trained how to handle sports "journalists" who don't care about their sport. Or any sports. </p><p><p>

## Dilbert pays tribute to Jordan Peterson being threatened by Ontario College and Peterson LOVES it

Jordan Peterson gets to live out the honor this week, as Dilbert pays homage to Peterson's drama with the Ontario College of Psychologists.</p><p><a href="https://dilbert.com/" target="_blank">Dilbert is the brainchild of Scott Adams</a>, who you know as being one of the few people on Twitter who are a) in the entertainment industry, and b) openly based. The comic satirizes working in an office and how the further up you get in middle management, the bigger of an ignoramus you become. </p><p>Peterson's strip doesn't deal with Dilbert's boss, it deals with his coworker Dogbert. Dogbert is...well, the Jordan Peterson of the office.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Dilbert today. Thanks for the tip of the hat <a href="https://twitter.com/ScottAdamsSays?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ScottAdamsSays</a>. Any complaints or comments about this, <a href="https://twitter.com/CPOntario?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CPOntario</a>? Looks like there's some disagreement about just who is truly "disgracing the profession." <a href="https://t.co/GHZBqCPqG8">pic.twitter.com/GHZBqCPqG8</a><br />— Dr Jordan B Peterson (@jordanbpeterson) <a href="https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson/status/1620096029860450310?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 30, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>To recap, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jordan-peterson-college-psycology" target="_blank">twelve people throughout the globe complained to the Ontario College of Psychologists</a> that Jordan Peterson is a disgrace to psychology. None of them have ever seen Peterson as a patient, and some aren't even from Canada. But Peterson is <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jordan-peterson-releases-complaint" target="_blank">a little too rock n roll on Twitter and when he hangs out with Joe Rogan</a>. So OCP (yeah, you know me) told Peterson he needs to be reeducated on how to use social media. Otherwise, he'll face a tribunal and possibly loses his license.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="d0aac" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32927370&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>In the world of Dilbert, it makes even less sense than it does in the world of Peterson. Because Dogbert is not a psychologist. Nor is he Canadian.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="51d07" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32927376&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>Canada is a place where they choose to be ruled by the walking pile of soy and hair goop known as Justin "I Feel Pretty" Trudeau. Factor that into a Canadian psychology sect going after a dog who is not Canadian nor a psychologist, and there is only one logical conclusion about the entire country.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="9e5dd" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32927393&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>Brilliant.</p><p>Though, if I could be so bold as to suggest a follow-up strip based on IRL events, there are those of us who feel Peterson SHOULD go through with the reeducation for no other reason than for the content. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jordan-peterson-ontario-college-educate" target="_blank">Broadcast it on Rumble and see who reeducates who</a>. </p><p>Dogbert needs to sit down and let Canadian psychologists attempt to reeducate him. It's the only logical conclusion.</p><p><p>
