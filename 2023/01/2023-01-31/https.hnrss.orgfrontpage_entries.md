<p>I've been looking for resources for our data team to apply best practices for testing SQL pipelines (we use DBT) but have not found anything. How do you test SQL pipelines? What patterns, tools and best practices would you recommend? Any good reference material you know of?</p>

## Tell HN: GitHub will delete your private repo if you lose access to the original

<p>I was surprised to see this in my email today:<p>> Your private repository baobabKoodaa/laaketutka-scripts (forked from futurice/how-to-get-healthy) has been deleted because you are no longer a collaborator on futurice/how-to-get-healthy.<p>That was an MIT-licensed open source project I worked on years ago. We published the source code for everyone to use, so I certainly did not expect to lose access to it just because someone at my previous company has been doing spring cleaning at GitHub! I had a 100% legal fork of the project, and now it's gone... why?<p>Turns out I don't even have a local copy of it anymore, so this actually caused me data loss. I'm fine with losing access to this particular codebase, I'm not using HN as customer support to regain access. I just wanted everyone to be aware that GitHub does this.</p>

## Ask HN: Are you as passionate as you used to be?

<p>At 13-20 years old, I was very curious and passionate about computers. I spent hours learning computer hacking and exploiting with buffer overflows, taught myself C, C++, linux, python, ... I did a lot of side projects in my 18s.<p>Now I'm 28 years old, working at a FAANG as a software engineer. It's been a couple of years that I don't have the same curiosity and passion to learn new technical things, outside of work, as I did before. I value and like learning new stuff in my day-to-day job, but thinking about learning a new programming language in my free time does not make me excited anymore.<p>Is this normal, possibly due to aging for some people? Or is it because all my curiosities have been solved, or could it be a symptom of chronic depression as I pretty much don't have craving for anything anymore?</p>

## Tell HN: Heroku deleted my database with no warning

<p>Last December, Heroku nuked the database on one of my active projects.  I was travelling at the end of the year and did not catch wind of this until I returned and saw messages about an issue with the app.  Sure enough, I checked and noticed that the database was gone and detached on December 9th.<p>Before the hate comes out, yes I know Heroku deprecated free tiers.  However, I did not understand this would affect my projects on paid dynos.  The real issue here is that I never received a single email or notice of any kind to my email about this.  From researching, it appears most people received SEVERAL notices about this.  I did not think there was an issue with my setup because I received zero communication.<p>Upon reaching out, Heroku has told me that they cannot recover the database.  They also admitted that there was "an issue" sending out notifications to me, and confirmed that none were sent.<p>So I guess just a warning to all - your database might be nuked at any time.  I learned my lesson about not doing an offsite backup regularly.  I guess the bigger lesson though is that Heroku should really be a last resort option for projects these days. RIP.</p>

## Launch HN: Needl (YC S22) – Simple search across all your apps
 - [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34598406](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34598406)

<p>Hi HN, we’re Max and James, co-founders of Needl (<a href="https://www.needl.tech">https://www.needl.tech</a>). Needl is a single search bar for all your apps that lets you find any document, message, or file you need. Here’s a demo video: <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/652ae56c8ee34bc2a84b8aacf479a9f4" rel="nofollow">https://www.loom.com/share/652ae56c8ee34bc2a84b8aacf479a9f4</a>.<p>We’ve all struggled to find information and couldn’t remember if it was shared over Gmail or Slack or Notion. Most of us have hundreds of thousands of emails, documents, messages, etc., and only a small fraction are actually useful. Internal search is even harder than web search in some ways: with web search, there are dozens of right answers and millions of previous searches to train ranking models, but internally (i.e. on your own data), there is only one right answer and limited training data.<p>Needl’s value prop is twofold: it unifies all of your information together and provides better search than existing platforms (here’s an example of Needl compared to Gmail: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/3ZX8f8Q" rel="nofollow">https://imgur.com/a/3ZX8f8Q</a>). Together, these save time by giving you exactly what you need. Recently we also launched a personal assistant that gives direct answers to any search. Simply ask, “What’s the budget for our 2023 team offsite?” or “When’s my next flight to SF and what’s the confirmation #?” From your web apps, we’ll generate the exact answer you need. (pro tip, you don’t even have to phrase it as a question).<p>To rank results on Needl, we combine text matching, semantic search, and platform-specific usage patterns (e.g. email opens). Semantic search (based on user intent / meaning) has helped us solve the hard problem of internal search – everyone has a different vernacular and way of organization. We use LLMs to create embeddings and then use vector search to allow greater breadth of results over traditional text-based search. Our search (and generative answers) even works well in different languages, something that surprised us.<p>To give generated answers to questions, we take the first results on Needl and run them through GPT-3 and use an engineered version of the user’s query to prompt GPT-3 accordingly. It’s similar to what Phind.com (Hello Cognition) and Perplexity.ai do with web search.<p>Using LLMs to build relationships between documents for search and recommendation was a remnant of our failed college startup. We had built a “TikTok for blog posts” that recommended user-written content based on their interactions with other posts. We quickly found out social media moderation was a nightmare (who would’ve thought) and few people enjoy reading any more.<p>It wasn’t until we threw in the white flag and went to our full-time jobs — James as a SWE at Microsoft and me in investment banking at Moelis — that we realized that recommendation + search was the real product. At my job in particular, intranet search was unusable. The primary way people “searched” for information was by sending company-wide e-mail blasts asking if anyone had materials about an industry or company! This got us wondering why internal search sucked so badly and led us down the path of building Needl.<p>Obviously with a product like this, privacy is the #1 concern for users. Some companies have solved this concern by going local first, but that involves significant reduction in quality of search, because LLMs can’t be run locally. We went the opposite route: users’ entire index is stored on the cloud. We know that’s not for everyone, but the results it enables are significantly more powerful, and we make clear commitments to our users: (1) we never access users’ personal information without explicit permission; (2) all information is encrypted both in transit and at rest, and (3) we will never sell users’ information. We’ve gotten SOC 2 Type II compliant to give our users assurances about the way their data is being handled and our dedication to information security.<p>Setting up Needl takes less than 3 minutes—users create an account, grant read access to the platforms they want to search through (Slack, Notion, GSuite, etc.), and we index their information. Once completed, you have instant, cross-platform search in a Spotlight-esque format—control + space opens Needl from anywhere.<p>In terms of pricing, Needl is free for up to 3 integrations and $10/month for unlimited integrations.<p>To learn more, you can download and set up Needl at <a href="https://www.needl.tech/">https://www.needl.tech/</a>. If you’ve already tried tools in this space, we’d love to hear your experience and what you care about most. We look forward to everyone’s comments!</p>

<p>Our B2B SaaS had its entire website cloned at another domain. The cloner then took the time to create a new logo and change a few colors.<p>We reached out to the hosting provider, and the registrar, neither care.<p>The cloned website is hosted in Europe (Germany), with a small hosting provider. Domain registration appears to be hostinger.com.<p>Our concerns: Search engine trouble, potential customer confusion, lost sales.<p>We found the clone when ahrefs started reporting a new domain linking to one of our sites, because they'd helpfully cloned our entire footer.<p>Thanks for all your advice!</p>

## Ask HN: Getting back into an IC role as a manager

<p>I've been in senior manager and director roles for the last 7 years. I miss coding at work and have enjoyed the coding I've been doing outside of work a lot more than anything substantial I've done as a manager. However, I also increasingly feel that my concrete tech chops are getting outdated or are just fading away. I used to be an excellent full-stack Rails engineer in full control of anything from AWS infrastructure to DB, Rails app server and front end. I am increasingly tempted to take a substantial, temporary pay cut moving back into an IC role. However, that would need to be at a different company, since I have zero interest working on anything my current employer has.<p>Has anyone made this jump back into an IC role? How did you find a role? What did you do to get the role?<p>Edit: Most importantly: Would you do it again?</p>
