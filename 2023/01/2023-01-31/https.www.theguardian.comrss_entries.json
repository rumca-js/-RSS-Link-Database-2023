Over the past few days, the sport has been celebrating the \u201cgreatest try of all time\u201d \u2013 the one <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/64079671\">scored</a> by Gareth Edwards for the Barbarians against the All Blacks in January 1973 \u2013 and on Saturday the <a href=\"https://www.sixnationsrugby.com/fixtures/\">Six Nations</a> championship begins, with Wales v Ireland at the Principality Stadium and England v Scotland at Twickenham. France play Italy in Rome on Sunday. These are matches to savour: clashes of styles, traditions, sporting cultures. That is the beauty of the Six Nations and why the competition, the pinnacle of rugby in the northern hemisphere, never fails to captivate. Sometimes the anthems seem to go on for longer than the matches \u2013 Ireland insist on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4ka-5j2vU\">singing</a> two and Italy have a virtually full-scale Verdi <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAZ7iFji2s4\">opera</a> \u2013 but that is as it should be. The theatre of the sport is everything.<br /><br />But offstage there are worrying noises, and some suggest rugby union \u2013 the 15-player game, as opposed to the 13-player rugby league version \u2013 faces an existential crisis. That was the <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/welsh-rugby-union-chief-executive-steve-phillips-resigns-after-claims-of-racism-sexism-and-homophobia-in-organisation-12798110\">term</a> used over the weekend by Nigel Walker, acting head of the Welsh rugby union (WRU), after allegations of a \u201ctoxic culture\u201d of misogyny, racism and homophobia at the organisation, which led to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/29/steve-phillips-resigns-wru-chief-executive-toxic-culture-claims\">resignation</a> of the WRU\u2019s chief executive on Sunday. <br /><br />The crisis in Wales is just one of an unprecedented set of challenges facing the sport. Safety concerns, with several former players showing symptoms of early-onset dementia, and in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/19/cte-rugby-chronic-traumatic-encephalopathy-legal-action\">some cases</a> threatening to sue the rugby authorities for negligence, have led to a rewriting of the tackle laws in an attempt to minimise head collisions. In England, that revision has turned into a shambles. The Rugby Football Union has <a href=\"https://www.englandrugby.com/news/article/rfu-council-approves-lowering-of-the-tackle-height-across-community-rugby-in-england-2023\">declared</a> that from 1 July in the amateur game, tackles must be made no higher than the waist, but in the professional game, upper-body contact will still be permitted. Critics argue the new law will make the situation worse, because it will lead to tacklers\u2019 heads being what Ireland coach <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/rugby/andy-farrell-rfu-tackle-law-change-six-nations-2023-b1055134.html\">Andy Farrell</a> calls \u201csitting ducks\u201d for ball carriers\u2019 knees. It also risks a bifurcation of the professional and amateur games.<br /><br />All this comes on top of worries about the financial viability of professional rugby: two English Premiership clubs, <a href=\"https://www.skysports.com/rugby-union/news/12321/12722978/wasps-gallagher-premiership-club-placed-into-administration\">Wasps</a> and <a href=\"https://www.skysports.com/rugby-union/news/12321/12705708/worcester-warriors-suspended-from-all-competitions-after-rfu-monday-deadline-missed\">Worcester Warriors</a>, went into administration last year; in Wales the regional structure introduced in the wake of professionalism \u2013 which has never been popular with fans \u2013 is tottering. <a href=\"https://www.world.rugby/news/582543\">Rugby</a> became a fully professional sport only in the 1990s and aspired to take on the football juggernaut, but that was always hopelessly ambitious.<br /><br />Many of the sport\u2019s current travails are the result of issues left unresolved 30 years ago, when an amateur, mostly recreational game based on traditional rivalries <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/29/rugby-union-should-be-wary-of-following-football-into-fantasy-land\">attempted</a> to become a global mega-sport. Rugby union lacks the simplicity of football at its best; its stop-start nature, the impenetrability of scrummaging and the arcane nature of the laws make it a challenge for spectators. It may have to accept it will always be more of a minority taste \u2013 a passionate game but not a mass market game. It needs to stay true to itself, improve its governance and meet the safety concerns of players and parents of potential players head on. It is essential for the sport that schools and amateur clubs go on playing rugby. The Six Nations is the resplendent icing on the rugby cake, but if the sport is not careful, there may soon be no cake.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/31/the-guardian-view-on-rugby-union-a-sport-rich-in-drama-is-at-a-crossroads\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-UK", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/31/tories-economic-failure-jeremy-hunt-nowhere-to-be-seen", "title": "Given chance to cheer Tories\u2019 economic failure, Hunt is nowhere to be seen | John Crace", "date_published": "2023-01-31 19:01:41+00:00", "description": "<p>If making the country poorer was a symbol of success, the IMF report was a Brexit day bonus</p><p>Hang out the flags.

This will only be possible when all consumers have smart meters. It is proving hard enough to convince consumers to install them without downsides becoming apparent. As with the current scheme, power demand will be reduced at peak time. However, instead of giving consumers money to do this, they will be penalised if they do not and the welfare consequences in terms of increased excess winter deaths, already far too high, will be serious.

But when life doesn\u2019t give you lemons (or limes, oranges and grapefruit), Ravinder Bhogal suggests looking to the Middle Eastern spice sumac. \u201cIt\u2019s sharp and sherbetty in a similar way to lemon,\u201d says the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ravinder-bhogal\">regular Guardian columnist</a> and chef-patron of <a href=\"https://www.jikonilondon.com/\">Jikoni</a> in London. \u201cIf you were making a dip, for example, and couldn\u2019t use lemon, finish it with sumac and you\u2019ll get the same level of acidity.\u201d</p><p>Peter Sanchez-Iglesias, chef-founder of <a href=\"https://www.casabristol.co.uk/\">Casa</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pacotapas.co.uk/\">Paco Tapas</a> in Bristol, and executive chef at <a href=\"https://www.decimo.london/\">Decimo</a> in London, agrees. He sprinkles sumac (and a drizzle of olive oil) over cooked fish: \u201cThat, for me, is the closest you can get to replicating that citrus flavour. I put it on everything: rice, eggs, salad ...\u201d The latter is a particularly good pairing with sumac, says <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thechayamaya/?hl=en\">Chaya Pugh</a>, development chef at the Ottolenghi Test Kitchen, both in the dressing or mixed with seeds to sprinkle on top. (Spoiler alert: \u201cLater this year, we\u2019re doing a watermelon recipe in the paper where, instead of using citrus juice, we mix sumac with sugar, salt and chilli for a tangy, sweet, spicy, sprinkly thing.\u201d) Alternatively, Sanchez-Iglesias peps up salads with pickle juice, be that from kimchi, pickled onions or even pickled eggs: \u201cUse a little of the liquid to make the dressing.\u201d</p><p>Got a culinary dilemma?

Rather, it is an almost endearingly amateurish package, written and directed by Ric Rawlins, that is an exercise in something that\u2019s almost as fashionable these days: folk horror. There\u2019s lashings of folk horror about these days, some of it, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/20/enys-men-review-mark-jenkin-cannes-2022\">Enys Men</a>, very good. Rewilding, however, is not very good, if we are being honest. But it\u2019s as folky as you get, telling three disconnected stories set in the West Country and Wales revolving around such folky elements as spooky coastal caves, trees that might once have been men, and Wicker Man-esque rituals in tiny villages. Plus, there\u2019s ersatz folk music on its soundtrack (some of it written by Rawlins himself), folk acting (as in really, really poor acting by non-professionals), and even folk editing and folk cinematography, which elevate inexperience and poor craftsmanship into an aesthetic in itself. The whole thing is very outsider cinema.</p><p>Rewilding could be fun if it were either a little more inept or a little more competent, but instead it\u2019s a bit of a chore. The first story, Stone Mothers, finds an unlucky archaeologist (John Matthews) investigating reports of the devil inside a sea cave accessible only at low tide. It gets bonus points for well-researched locations, but you have to take those back for having a protagonist so dim he never thinks to make a note of the tides, or even just install a handy app. The Family Tree finds a writer (Natasha Neckles) booking an Airbnb in a village so she can write about local trees, and finding one that bleeds and has human eyes looking through bore holes \u2013 at least, in her dreams.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/31/rewilding-review-british-folk-horror-ric-rawlins\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-UK", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/31/womens-world-cup-football-sponsored-visit-saudi-arabia", "title": "Saudi Arabia to sponsor Women\u2019s World Cup and tighten ties with Fifa", "date_published": "2023-01-31 12:57:04+00:00", "description": "<ul><li>Tourist authority joins international brands on list</li><li>World Cup starts on 20 July at Eden Park, Auckland</li></ul><p>Saudia Arabia\u2019s tourist authority is to sponsor football\u2019s Women\u2019s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand this year, despite the country\u2019s history of oppression of women\u2019s rights.</p><p>Fifa is expected to confirm that Visit Saudi will join international brands such as Adidas, Coca-Cola and Visa in attaching its name to the 32-team tournament that will kick off in front of an expected 50,000 supporters at Auckland\u2019s Eden Park on 20 July.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/31/womens-world-cup-football-sponsored-visit-saudi-arabia\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-UK", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/31/alexander-zverev-faces-no-action-on-abuse-claims-olga-sharypova-after-exhaustive-investigation", "title": "Zverev faces no action on abuse claims after \u2018exhaustive\u2019 investigation", "date_published": "2023-01-31 12:50:46+00:00", "description": "<ul><li>World No 14 tennis player accused by girlfriend Olga Sharypova</li><li>ATP cite \u2018lack of reliable evidence and eyewitness reports\u2019</li></ul><p>The ATP has decided to take no disciplinary action against the German tennis player Alexander Zverev after a 15-month independent investigation found \u201cinsufficient evidence to substantiate published allegations of abuse\u201d.</p><p>Zverev, the Tokyo Olympic gold medallist and world No 14, had been accused by his former Russian girlfriend, Olga Sharypova, of being emotionally and physically abusive during their relationship, including at the ATP Masters 1000 event in Shanghai in 2019 and in Monaco, New York and Geneva.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/31/alexander-zverev-faces-no-action-on-abuse-claims-olga-sharypova-after-exhaustive-investigation\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-UK", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/31/woodpeckers-sparrows-annual-uk-bird-count-rspb-big-garden-birdwatch", "title": "Woodpeckers and sparrows thrive in annual UK bird count", "date_published": "2023-01-31 12:49:17+00:00", "description": "<p>Readers tell us about their sightings as part of RSPB\u2019s Big Garden Birdwatch, with many species flourishing</p><p>The Big Garden Birdwatch, a citizen survey organised by the RSPB, has returned for its 44th year.

Attraction to an unsanctioned partner or to someone in an inappropriate environment can really increase the erotic charge. But, while some forbidden liaisons last, most are fleeting or lose some of the spark if they become sanctioned. In the past you found casual sex inspiring, but in a lasting relationship you will have to discover how to have satisfying sex without the thrill of a one-night stand. If there is genuine attraction between you and your current partner, this should be possible. If, however, your current situation is a relationship based more on a fantasy of what you think you want, it may not develop. Meanwhile, it would be worth investigating your lowered sexual interest as a symptom of some other cause, such as depression, anxiety, stress, or medication side-effects.</p><p>Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</p><p>If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to <a href=\"mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com\">private.lives@theguardian.com</a> (please don\u2019t send attachments).
