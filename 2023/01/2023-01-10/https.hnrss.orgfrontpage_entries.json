I used to not have trouble with any topic, but now I have to re-read text several times, I have to take a ton of notes (40+ pages per chapter), I am skipping lines and transposing characters.<p>I went to a specialist for academic learning and they did a battery of tests and told me my reading level is very low and were surprised I am even in a medical program.<p>I went to a development/behavioral ophthalmologist and they prescribed new lenses and cognitive eye therapy. The lenses seem to help but the eye therapy isn't.<p>I am at risk of needing to withdrawal.\nPerhaps pausing this education is the best thing while I get this under control, but I don't see a path to start on.<p>Any advice?<p>Edit: I have talked with my advisor and instructors and they don't have advice except to seek more help, ask even more questions.<p>Edit 2: Taking no meds for the last 9 months, never had Covid, my PCP referred me to the development/behavioral ophthalmologist.<p>Edit 3: no alcohol, no drugs, no ADHD medications.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a

It is extremely easy to embed in your apps just as a react component. The original purpose is to develop a lite plugin that can be easily embedded in most cases, it doesn't have to be a large BI, but a lite graphic plugin.<p>GitHub: Kanaries/graphic-walker, <a href=\"https://github.com/Kanaries/graphic-walker\">https://github.com/Kanaries/graphic-walker</a><p>The main features implemented:\n* A user-friendly drag-and-drop-based interaction for exploratory data analysis with visualizations.\n* A grammar of graphics-based visual analytic user interface where users can build visualization from low-level visual channel encodings.\n* A Data Explainer explains why some patterns occur / what may cause them.\n* Using web workers to handle computation tasks which allows you to use it as a pure front-end app.\nAnd you can use it in your app as a react component:h me in github or discord.<p>Feedbacks and advice are welcome!

The code I'm porting is average code, not terrible, but plenty of little things to complain about.<p>I feel like my past self could have handled this task, but I am really struggling. Porting this API will require a deep understanding of the existing API, which, of course, has several layers of abstraction.<p>I can't seem to hold more than about 2 levels of call stack in my head. There's the entry point function which calls other functions, which call other functions, which call other functions, etc. You know how it is, code calls other code, and logically it forms a tree of calls and return values that often goes several layers deep. I struggle to hold more than about 2 levels of this call stack in my head. By the time I'm down in the weeds I've forgotten what I'm doing, what the purpose of the actual API call is.<p>I don't know how to break this into small enough chunks that I can understand it or make progress. Imagine I gave you the code for the sha512 algorithm, and a hash, and asked you to find the pre-image (the input). This is how I feel. Where do I even get started? How do I find even a single chunk of manageable work to break off.<p>The hard part is, several other developers are making progress on porting this API. Why can't I? What happened?<p>I don't know if this task is just an especially bad fit for me, or if my mental abilities are declining?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34324567\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34324567</a></p>\n<p>Points: 96</p>\n<p># Comments: 98</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://muted.io/piano-chords/", "title": "Show HN: Piano Chord Player", "date_published": "2023-01-10 13:20:15+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://muted.io/piano-chords/\">https://muted.io/piano-chords/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34324404\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34324404</a></p>\n<p>Points: 24</p>\n<p># Comments: 5</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/consumer/average-ev-fast-charging-costs-soar-above-petrol", "title": "Average EV fast-charging costs soar above petrol", "date_published": "2023-01-10 13:09:11+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/consumer/average-ev-fast-charging-costs-soar-above-petrol\">https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/consumer/average-ev-fast-charging-costs-soar-above-petrol</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34324270\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34324270</a></p>\n<p>Points: 27</p>\n<p># Comments: 9</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34324208", "title": "Tell HN: We Need Robots.txt but for AI", "date_published": "2023-01-10 13:04:49+00:00", "description": "<p>The web is filled with posts where people have poured heart and soul into their writing.

I've been working on a code editor and I think that it's mature enough to catch some interest. It's using a custom GPU accelerated GUI written in C++. Currently implements some interesting features: LSP, terminal, auto-completion, linters, formatters, custom keybindings, plugins and more. It's a hobby project but still intends to be an alternative to other popular code editors like Sublime, Kate, Lapce, Lite XL (and takes inspiration from them).\nThe project was born as a playground for the GUI I'm developing (eepp GUI) and is advanced enough to currently be my main code editor, but it's a work in progress, and many features are still pending.\nSome minor hints on how to use it:\nFolders are used as project (and .gitignore is used to ignore files)\nThe wheel icon on the top-right has all the options you need (Ctrl/Cmd + M to show).\nSome keybidings to navigate any project (navigation is keyboard driven):\nCtrl/Cmd + K = Locate Files\nCtrl/Cmd + Shift + F = Global Search\nCtrl/Cmd + Number (Go to tab #)</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a

"date_published": "2023-01-10 02:05:37+00:00", "description": "<p>Today our host cancelled a place we booked 6 month ago with zero communication, at time of check-in.<p>We landed at our destination and ready to check into our Airbnb that we booked almost 6 month ago, for an entire month.<p>The airbnb is managed by a company, who I assume manages the entire building.<p>The host promptly tells us it's no longer available, and that we should accept their offer of either refund or another listing that's in a completely different location,  with no picture or reviews, but promised that it's \"similar\"<p>Of course, being hesitant, we said no thanks, we're happy with just a refund.<p>They proceeds to tells us to contact airbnb, and then ghosts us.<p>We open a ticket with Airbnb, calls them, and they proceed to give us the run around and tell us to just book another stay.<p>So what else are we going to do? be homeless for a night in foreign city?<p>So of course we try to book, except it's last minute and the only listings available are the once you must contact the hosts first.<p>Good thing we arrived at 11am and not 6pm. or we'd be literally f*cked for the night.<p>Why am I complaining?<p>Airbnb, you should do better.<p>I am a startup founder, I understand these types of situations has probably zero affect on your bottom line. So you probably never prioritized the need to spend engineering time \"fixing\" it.<p>You also probably look at your metrics and say, well these situations happen to <1% of our overall bookings, it's not a problem.<p>But PG says, the best startups are the ones who solve intense immediate pain for a small number of people.<p>Well, my confidence in you is absolutely shaken, and now I'm not so sure your position in the space is so infallible anymore. Because eventually this will happen often enough that \"the small number of users with intense pain\" will give arise to a newer and better version of you, and you will be legacy.<p>In the end, we booked another place last minute, had to spend 2x the amount and received a refund (well let's see in 10 days).<p>If I was in a much lesser able financial situation, I might not have been able to float a few thousands of dollars on my credit card, and may have literally ended up homeless.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34319414\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34319414</a></p>\n<p>Points: 89</p>\n<p># Comments: 53</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.jonandnic.com/2023/01/08/old-man-yells-at-cloud/", "title": "Old Man Yells at Cloud: Technology has gotten objectively worse", "date_published": "2023-01-10 01:58:53+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.jonandnic.com/2023/01/08/old-man-yells-at-cloud/\">https://www.jonandnic.com/2023/01/08/old-man-yells-at-cloud/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34319361\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34319361</a></p>\n<p>Points: 78</p>\n<p># Comments: 48</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/01/16/can-ups-still-deliver-a-middle-class-life", "title": "UPS and the Package Wars", "date_published": "2023-01-10 00:50:04+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/01/16/can-ups-still-deliver-a-middle-class-life\">https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/01/16/can-ups-still-deliver-a-middle-class-life</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34318783\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34318783</a></p>\n<p>Points: 28</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/01/extending-android-sdk.html", "title": "Extending the Android SDK", "date_published": "2023-01-10 00:40:14+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/01/extending-android-sdk.html\">https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/01/extending-android-sdk.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34318703\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34318703</a></p>\n<p>Points: 8</p>\n<p># Comments: 3</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.barrons.com/articles/banks-fleeing-crypto-bitcoin-worried-51673278376", "title": "Banks Are Fleeing Crypto.
