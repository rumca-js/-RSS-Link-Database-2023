A punchy slogan t-shirt, papped at the right moment, can become an enduring image in our cultural history. In 2002, shortly after her public split with Justin Timberlake, Britney Spears' stepped out wearing a baby blue tee with the all caps mandate "DUMP HIM," a look which quickly became enshrined in the internet's clapback hall of fame (Etsy is filled with thousands of copy-cat t-shirts over two decades later.) Paris Hilton, too, was long immortalized as a meme after wearing an apparently-inflammatory black and white vest with the slogan  "Stop being poor!" in 2005 â€” in 2021 Hilton proved the image was doctored, however, with the actual text reading "Stop being desperate!" More recently, ahead of the release of her fifth studio album "Crash," musician Charli XCX pre-empted negative reviews by wearing a pastel pink crop top that said "They don't build statues of critics." Primarily a vehicle for sassy responses to low-brow drama, the slogan tee is a mouthpiece for the wearer â€” saying the quiet part out loud in a way that avoids direct responsibility.
