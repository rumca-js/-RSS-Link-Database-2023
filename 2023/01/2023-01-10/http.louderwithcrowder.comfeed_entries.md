## WATCH: Joy Behar tries to explain why Biden taking classified docs is totally different from Trump. Fails.

Now, I know what you're thinking-- this sounds a whole lot like what led the FBI to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/judge-trump-raid-jeffrey-epstein" target="_blank">raid</a> Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence over the summer. But since Biden is just a harmless, half-dead husk of a person, he didn't get a raid, and the media kept it a secret since the documents were discovered right before the midterms.  </p><p>Resident Genius of <em>The View</em>, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joy-behar-branches-government" target="_blank">Joy Behar</a>, perfectly explained liberal logic on why this scenario is totally different from what Trump did:</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cJoy Behar on Biden\u2019s classified documents: \u201cWe all know that Trump is a liar and a thief \u2026 So it\u2019s not that big a jump to say that he obstructed and he lied. We don\u2019t think that Biden is a liar and a thief, so we give him the benefit of the doubt.\u201d\n\n\u201d</div> ‚Äî The Post Millennial (@The Post Millennial)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/TPostMillennial/status/1612864791399522306">1673371906</a>
</blockquote>
<p>It is quite funny to see them try and justify why such clearly parallel events actually aren't the same at all. It really seems that in their minds, Biden is just a silly old Grandpa who loves ice cream and occasionally says things that don't make a whole lot of sense. His moral compass could never stray so far!<em></em></p><p>CNN even gave their 67 viewers talking points on why exactly these two scenarios are very much different from one another:</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cThere are clear distinctions between the two classified documents cases involving President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump https://t.co/QmIE2flpov\u201d</div> ‚Äî CNN Politics (@CNN Politics)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/CNNPolitics/status/1612844926101819392">1673367170</a>
</blockquote>
<p>What could actually make Biden's case <em>worse</em> than Trump's is the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/jan/10/discovery-biden-documents-sparks-debate-over-vice-/" target="_blank">dispute</a> over the Vice President's ability to declassify documents. Trump has argued that, as President, he was able to declassify anything he wanted. Legal scholars have disagreed on that point. It's even more unclear regarding the VP's powers. </p><p>Under a 2003 executive order, Vice Presidents are able to classify sensitive materials but are only able to declassify materials they themselves classified. It's not clear if this would apply to documents from intelligence agencies. The documents found at Biden's residence are <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/10/politics/biden-classified-documents-iran-ukraine-united-kingdom-beau-funeral/index.html" target="_blank">reportedly</a> U.S. intelligence memos on Iran, the United Kingdom, and...Ukraine. </p><p>It's probably just a coincidence that Biden took sensitive information on Ukraine, where he got the top prosecutor fired and Hunter Biden served on the board of Burisma. Just one BIG coincidence, NOTHING to see here, DON'T LOOK BEHIND THE CURTAIN!</p><p><p>

## Washington D.C. reminds criminals that murder is bad by...putting up 'Thou Shalt Not Kill' posters

Specifically, His sixth commandment, "Thou Shalt Not Kill."</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cCommunity leaders in D.C. are set to launch a "Thou shalt not kill," campaign, with red and white posters, to try to stop the recent surge in gun violence.\n\nhttps://t.co/6ijcux05g9\u201d</div> ‚Äî WTOP (@WTOP)

</blockquote>
<p>Philip Pannell, a nonprofit director who's spearheading the poster movement, said, "<em>The message ‚ÄòThou shalt not kill‚Äô is just as powerful and just as relevant in 2023 as it was thousands of years ago."  </em>Well, I would sure hope so.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">.<a href="https://twitter.com/AnacostiaCCDC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AnacostiaCCDC</a> launches ‚ÄúThou Shalt Not Kill‚Äù a new initiative to combat murders in DC to ‚Äúprick the conscience of our community.‚Äù<br /><br />The event is being held at <a href="https://twitter.com/busboysandpoets?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@busboysandpoets</a>. <a href="https://t.co/b1838LkKRr">pic.twitter.com/b1838LkKRr</a><br />‚Äî Beatrice-Elizabeth Peterson (@MissBeaE) <a href="https://twitter.com/MissBeaE/status/1612907818813722625?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 10, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p><br /></p><p>The move comes after the police chief called last year's homicide rate "absolutely unacceptable." Though <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/los-angeles-target-detergent" target="_blank">crime</a> was slightly down from 2021, the past two years each saw over 200 murders, the first time that has happened back-to-back in <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/man-fatally-shot-becomes-dc-s-200th-homicide-this-year/ar-AA15OVYI" target="_blank">nearly</a> 20 years. And 2023 seems to be off to an even <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/2023-off-to-violent-start-for-dc-with-crime-up-and-some-residents-worried/ar-AA168q3C" target="_blank">worse</a> start, with car thefts already up 113%, robberies up 57%, and property crime up 42% since this time of last year. <br /></p><p>Mayor Bowser's office is providing 1,000 posters and a local restaurant owner is underwriting the cost of 2,000 posters. Parnell hopes the posters will help reverse the desensitization to murder that has taken hold of D.C. residents and reduce gun violence. </p><p>An alternative solution to rampant gun violence could be - hear me out - prosecuting criminals. I know, I know. Crazy stuff. But last November, the D.C. City Council <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/11/15/dc-criminal-code-passes-objections/" target="_blank">rejected</a> an amendment to its soft-on-crime criminal code that would have increased penalties for carrying an unlicensed firearm. Mayor Bowser, to her credit, <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/dc-mayor-bowser-vetoes-criminal-code-overhaul/3247124/" target="_blank">vetoed</a> the code but said she supports the majority of it. Sigh. </p><p>I appreciate the good intentions behind these posters, but it is pretty hilarious. Just imagine a hardened criminal, gun drawn, about to terrorize some innocent civilians, but he suddenly sees this poster and remembers God doesn't want us to kill each other. He drops the gun, goes to college, marries the love of his life, and has three kids and a white picket fence. All because of the poster that reminded him that murder is bad, actually. </p><p>Yeeeeaaah. Probably <em>not</em> going to happen. But anything's possible! </p><p><p>

## NYT whines Ron DeSantis won't talk to them and the one-word Team DeSantis response is perfection

It's the consultant class. It's RINOs. It's libertarians. It's apolitical people. Joe Rogan and Dave Portnoy just had a kibitz about how there's no such thing as "non-partisan" media. </p><p>No one trusts an alleged "non-partisan" media. The only people who feel otherwise are employed by corporate media or partisan leftists that rely on corporate media to spread their narrative.</p><p>Ron DeSantis, unlike some people, doesn't yearn for media approval. He doesn't need to give them full access, then act shocked that they acted like snakes when their articles hit. DeSantis knows damn well the media are snakes before talking to them. So he doesn't. He doesn't need to.</p><p><p>

URL was an Electronic Storage Detection Canine, which means he could literally sniff out the child <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/balenciaga-cooper-kupp" target="_blank">porn</a> in the homes of sickos.

<p>URL worked on over 2,000 search warrants to sniff out electronic devices that stored porn.

<p>For his porn-sniffing expertise, URL gained a lot of media attention, including from Breitbart, The Washington Post, The Daily Mail, and The Sun. He was even interviewed by Terry Crews and featured on COPS in 2017. </p><p>But this story gets even better. Not only was URL a badass pedo-buster. He was an inspirational underdog who no one thought would succeed. </p><p>He was not originally bred as a police dog and was passed around from pound to pound. He had actually earned a reputation of being "untrainable." Luckily, someone eventually recognized his unique talents and affinity for busting pedophiles, and he received proper training. </p><p>So the moral of the story is: if this former pound-puppy was able to turn his life around and put thousands of pedophiles in jail, you can probably do something kind of interesting with your life too. </p><p>You probably won't be as cool as this dog though.

## LOL: Check out Stacey Abrams claiming her boyfriend dumped her for being 'too ambitious'

<p>Abrams also told Drew Barrymore a very odd story about a boy who broke up with her because she was just too perfect:</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cStacey Abrams: "When I was in college, I fell in love with a boy who was mean to me. He broke up with me and he said that I was too ambitious and wanted too many things, and I would end up alone and lonely."\u201d</div> ‚Äî Greg Price (@Greg Price)

<p>If this man was also named Corn Pop, then the story might make a little more sense.</p><p>Abrams ran for Governor of Georgia in 2018, as well as this past year's 2022 election. She claims Republican Governor Brian Kemp stole the elections through "voter suppression" tactics--this despite increased turnout across the state.

Now, to her credit, she did concede this most recent election, but couldn't help but compare herself to the Apostle Paul in her concession speech. Baby steps.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>But Stacey's campaign isn't looking so hot at the moment. Yesterday, Abrams reported more than $1.4M in debt to the state campaign finance commission. This is quite flabbergasting, given she raised a <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/abrams-campaign-raised-record-113-million-for-governors-race-still-owes-money/XZQDTEOTUBHR7CFDVXJGM4HCBE/" target="_blank">record</a> $113M to lose by 8 points. By comparison, Kemp only raised $78M. </p><p>Abrams' campaign manager claimed the exorbitant funds raised were due to a "cavalcade of negative press." But some staffers claim there was actually crazy spending going on, including a "hype house" rented for $12,500 a month to make TikTok videos in. They also bought a pop-up shop and "swag truck" to give free merchandise to young voters. I don't know about you, but if I saw a "swag truck" offering me free goodies, I would run for the hills before I made the next episode of Dateline.</p><p>As a result of the ill-advised spending, Abrams actually had to cut airwave spending by half in the final two weeks leading up to the election, which her manager has since admitted was done to reign in expenses. </p><p>But who knows, maybe the third time really is the charm for twice-failed gubernatorial candidates! </p><p><p>

## New 'medical' guidance recommends surgery and pumping your obese twelve-year-old full of drugs

There is new The Science for us all to follow! If your kid is fat, you should consider drugs and surgery. Only if they are at least twelve and thirteen, though. Drugs and surgery before that would be inadvisable. </p><p>This is the latest guidance from <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/obesity-kids-teens-drugs-surgery-early-new-guidelines/?ftag=CNM-00-10aab7e&amp;linkId=196547890" target="_blank">the American Academy of Pediatrics</a>. Not unlike how <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/cdc-director-school-mask-mandate" target="_blank">masking your kids was a guidance</a>. I want to make sure I quote this part verbatim:</p><blockquote>For the first time, the group's guidance sets ages at which kids and teens should be offered medical treatments such as drugs and surgery ‚Äî<strong><em> in addition to intensive diet, exercise and other behavior and lifestyle interventions</em></strong>.</blockquote><p>You and I know how the internet goes.  It's going to be presented as drugs and surgery <em>instead</em> of diet and exercise. And that's just not the case. It also doesn't make the guidance sound any less batsh*t crazy. Or as a colleague put it at the water cooler, you pump kids full of the FDA food pyramid-mandated carb diet, set them in front of screens all day, then think the solution is more drugs and the knife.</p><p>It comes down to three things: eating less, moving more, and parenting. If you want to fight your kid's obesity and are tired of having to buy a new wardrobe every time they outgrow the old one, have them eat less and move more. </p><p>It might also mean making different lifestyle choices for yourself too. My mom was a teacher for twenty-five years, and you would see at field days what the skinny parents were feeding their skinny kids and what the fat parents were feeding their fat kids. I remember one mother using chocolate-covered potato chips to shovel mounds of sour onion dip into her mouth. SPOILER: her son was not picked first for kickball.</p><p>Though what I find most amusing about this guidance will be when the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bill-burr-wnba-netflix" target="_blank">fat pride</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/body-positivity-donuts-spices" target="_blank">body positivity</a> folks start to devour the research. Instead of pumping your kid full of drugs and putting them under the knife, you should celebrate them being at risk for diabetes and heart disease!</p><p><p>

## Watch: Not sure what's happening here, but Biden sounds like he confused Salvation Army member for Polish secret service

The "independent" "fact" checkers are dispatched to say their is a perfectly logical explanation why Biden looks like he doesn't know where he is, what he's doing, or if he remembered to put on pants. I'm sure Joe Biden had a reason for, after being introduced to Salvation Army members, discussing how he used to pal around with secret service agents in Poland and Ukraine.</p><p>I'll be damned if I can figure out that reason now.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">"And here we have folks from the Salvation Army.‚Äù<br /><br />Biden: "I spent some time with the Secret Service in Poland and in Ukraine."<br /><br />Salvation Army guy: *nods* ‚ÄúOh yeah..‚Äù<br /> <a href="https://t.co/o1gNF2jEKV">pic.twitter.com/o1gNF2jEKV</a><br />‚Äî Greg Price (@greg_price11) <a href="https://twitter.com/greg_price11/status/1612507274727284742?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 9, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>HANDLER: And here we have folks from the Salvation Ar...<br /><br />BIDEN: I spent some time with the Secret Service in Poland and in Ukraine.

</p>
<p>The video is from Joe Biden's "visit" to the "border" on Wednesday. As much as I hate "this photo is all you need to know" tweets, this photo is all you need to know about the visit:</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">El Paso cleared the illegal homeless camps for Biden‚Äôs visit today: <a href="https://t.co/SqE08tzQ4w">pic.twitter.com/SqE08tzQ4w</a><br />‚Äî End Wokeness (@EndWokeness) <a href="https://twitter.com/EndWokeness/status/1612096799447339008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>As for what critics are calling Joe Biden's latest senior moment, the dude whose hand he is shaking looks as confused as the rest of us.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="7115a" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32651513&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>While the "independent" "fact" checkers get their scripts to explain away what looks like Ol' Puddinghead showing off his dementia again, we should consider ourselves lucky the president didn't cause an international incident. Bringing up Poland and Ukraine can both be dangerous. The latter could lead to Joey discussing his son Hunter's business dealings. The former could lead to "how many Polish secret service experts does it take to screw in a solar light bulb?"</p><p><p>

## NFL legend Tony Dungy SHREDS 'Scientific American's' pathetic attempt to inject race into Damar Hamlin injury

Leave it to a leftist blogger to try and inject race into it under the guise of "the science." Among those not amused? Super Bowl winning NFL legend <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tony-dungy-shuts-anti-christian-nick-foles-hater" target="_blank">Tony Dungy</a>.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">The ‚Äúterrifyingly ordinary‚Äù nature of football‚Äôs violence disproportionately affects Black men <a href="https://t.co/qpQB8Veppb">https://t.co/qpQB8Veppb</a><br />‚Äî Scientific American (@sciam) <a href="https://twitter.com/sciam/status/1611515577234767872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>It was written in Scientific American, so OBVIOUSLY "the science" is settled that racism is afoot. Unamused by it is Coach Dungy, and he has some authority to speak on the issue. "As a black man and former NFL player, I can say this article is absolutely ridiculous."</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">As a black man and former NFL player I can say this article is absolutely ridiculous.<br />‚Äî Tony Dungy (@TonyDungy) <a href="https://twitter.com/TonyDungy/status/1611551363212922881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>The sciencey content follows a basic formula on the left: a thing happens + find an excuse to claim RAAAAAAACISM = all the clicks. It's also common among the Democrat Party, as we saw yesterday with <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/gas-stoves-biden" target="_blank">Biden considering a ban on gas stoves</a>. They take something Americans enjoy that they want to ban, then add the words "adversely affects minority and marginalized communities."</p><p>With the Scientific American article, it's football:</p><blockquote>The ordinariness of men running into each other at full speed represents a normalized‚Äîeven rationalized‚Äîviolence that is routine to this American game.</blockquote><p>The adverse effect is that because there are more non-white people who play in the NFL (the article claims 70%), that means more non-white people get injured. Hence, RAAAAAAACISM. And not MAAAAAATH.</p><p>What also follows suit when a leftist says something controversial is they then complain when people criticize them for it. I could have sworn I saw tweets where the author did that, and claimed her critics were denying racism exists. I should have bookmarked the tweets yesterday...</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>More importantly when it comes to Demar Hamlin:</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">An amazing update. ‚ù§Ô∏èüíô <a href="https://t.co/Do1P1nKQWI">pic.twitter.com/Do1P1nKQWI</a><br />‚Äî Buffalo Bills (@BuffaloBills) <a href="https://twitter.com/BuffaloBills/status/1612542457383718912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 9, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>He will no doubt be there in spirit, if not in attendance, when the Bills "squish the Fish" on Sunday. As for Bills Mafia, I hope someone covers a folding table with copies of the Scientific American article and drops the elbow.</p><p><p>

## Watch: Woke school board cuts mother off, so her son saves the day and hammers them with reality

A lot has changed since then. Most notably, our parents didn't have to show up at school board meetings and ask the school board to please not provide porn and other sexual materials to students. We discovered sex and porn the old-fashioned way: with a stack of nudie mags in the woods or by pushing the "3" and "7" buttons together at the same time on the cable box. Now, the woke Marxist tw*ats who run our public schools feel graphic sex is the only way to teach "tolerance" and "inclusion."</p><p>There is some context missing from this video, such as the comments the mother was allowed to make and her specific issue. I believe we've seen enough of these videos to fill in the blanks. The focus is on her son saving the day and the point he made.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

<blockquote>If you Google [these topics] on our Chromebooks [provided by the school],  type on our Chromebook, search on our Chromebooks, it's immediately flagged. You block us from consuming this content on our Chromebooks because it's not something children should be consuming in a school environment. Or frankly, at all. But then you leave it available to us in our libraries for students to freely read. That's a double standard that I don't think should be in schools. None of this should be in our schools. There's no educational value to any of this in our libraries. I think you guys understand that.</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>The dude's right. If a student were to Google "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/school-board-chicago-summer-reading" target="_blank">tasting yourself</a>" or "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/school-board-recommended-book" target="_blank">proper techniques in giving a hand job</a>" or "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chicago-private-school-dean-students" target="_blank">whether to use spit or lube while performing anal sex</a>," that student would be blocked from viewing it on school computers. Yet if a progressive author writes a book on it -- especially if that progressive author checks off one or more of the left's preferred marginalized groups -- not only is it appropriate for students, but it should be recommended reading. The feeling among these grown-ass adults who determine what your child is taught is that a student can't be expected to learn how to be tolerant of other genders without reading a graphic novel that discusses "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/school-keeps-gender-book" target="_blank">vagina slime</a>."</p><p>And if a parent has a problem with it, the parent is the problem. Not the Democrat Party's frantic obsession with looking to sexualize students at every opportunity while they are a captive audience in school.</p><p>Shout out to this young king coming to his mother's defense. We mama's boys have to stick together.</p><p><p>
