the president\u2019s top ministers has told the Guardian.<br /><br />Speaking at the presidential palace on Tuesday, the minister of institutional relations, Alexandre Padilha, said he believed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/09/storming-of-brasilia-government-buildings-in-maps-and-videos\">Sunday\u2019s far-right assault on the three branches of Brazil\u2019s government </a>was \u201can act of terrorism\u201d designed to bring down Lula\u2019s week-old government.</p><p>And Padilha said the insurrection in support of the former far-right president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jair-bolsonaro\">Jair Bolsonaro</a> might have succeeded had it not been for Lula\u2019s decision to order a federal intervention that put his administration in charge of security in the capital, Bras\u00edlia.<br /><br />Ibaneis Rocha, the pro-Bolsonaro governor of the federal district which contains Brazil\u2019s capital, was suspended from his post on Sunday night amid outrage that local security forces had failed to stop thousands of radical Bolsonaristas ransacking the presidential palace, congress and supreme court.<br /><br />\u201cIf the government of the federal district had acted as agreed with the minister of defense and the minister of justice, none of what happened on Sunday would have happened,\u201d Padilha said, denouncing what he called \u201cterrorist attacks\u201d on the heart of Brazilian democracy.<br /><br />\u201cPerhaps, if we hadn\u2019t had a leader with the popular support and ability to build political bridges that President Lula enjoys \u2026 Brazilian history might have been different when it came to the attempted coup, [and] the storming of the supreme court, congress and the presidential palace,\u201d Padilha said, noting how on Sunday free buses were laid on for Bolsonarista militants hoping to join the insurrection from different parts of the country. <br /><br />The minister also praised the unity shown in the wake of the attacks by the leaders of Brazil\u2019s supreme court, lower house and congress, and Brazil\u2019s 27 regional governors, who gathered in the rubble-strewn plaza outside the presidential palace on Monday night in a powerful show of support for Lula\u2019s new administration and Brazilian democracy. <br /><br />\u201cAll of this was halted, it was stopped thanks to the firm response of President Lula,\u201d and the pro-democracy consensus between political leaders of all stripes, added Padilha.</p> <a

It needed to. I feel like I\u2019ve had babies I\u2019ve been less organised for than this particular arrival. There have, it is fair to say, been one or two thousand pre-publication spoilers for Spare, each of which a lot of people have consumed without really meaning to. There\u2019s something about it having all taken place over the turn of the year that reminds you of eating nothing but Christmas food for days and days and days. After about a week of it, you do find yourself screaming: \u201cI never want to see this stuff again! Can we please, PLEASE have a Chinese or a curry?\u201d That said, I do still have one box of mince pies and one royal tell-all left, and I think we both know I\u2019m going to get through them. It\u2019s called duty \u2013 look it up.</p><p>Anyway, on to the reaction. As I type this, Harry\u2019s entire home town of Montecito is <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/california-flooding-Montecito-evacuation-order-7c151eeaf3f567a125d74245173327f1\">under evacuation</a> amid floods some will no doubt choose to see as biblical. We can only guess how the book has gone down in Windsor Elsinore. Some judge that Harry has opened a hail of literary gunfire on a royal family whose courtiers constantly emphasise are limited in the ways they can fight back. Maybe this is a metaphor. As one of the more eye-catching passages of Prince Harry\u2019s book reveals, during the conflict in Afghanistan he killed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/06/army-veterans-criticise-prince-harry-claim-killed-25-taliban-afghanistan\">25 Taliban fighters out of his $50m helicopter</a>, a form of warfare which even the most committed Taliban-loathers among us always had to admit was a bit asymmetric. Then again, the Taliban won in the end, so we should certainly consider the possibility that the monarchy will be the last ones standing in the rubble when Harry\u2019s barrage ends.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/10/prince-harry-one-flew-over-the-windsors-nest-spare\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/10/russia-wagner-group-fighting-heavy-bloody-battles-control-soledar", "title": "Russia\u2019s Wagner group fighting \u2018heavy, bloody battles\u2019 for control of Soledar", "date_published": "2023-01-10 12:11:36+00:00", "description": "<p>UK says most of Ukrainian saltmine town near Bakhmut is in Russian hands after intensive fighting</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jan/10/russia-ukraine-blog-live-almost-no-walls-left-in-soledar-says-zelenskiy-as-fierce-fighting-continues\">Russia-Ukraine war \u2013 latest news updates</a></li></ul><p><strong> </strong>The Russian mercenary group Wagner has said it is fighting \u201cheavy, bloody battles\u201d for control of the town of Soledar as part of Moscow\u2019s months-long offensive to capture Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donetsk region.</p><p>Wagner\u2019s claims appeared to be confirmed by the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence (MoD), which suggested that most of Soledar, a small town about six miles (10km) north of the key city of Bakhmut, was in Russian hands after Moscow continued to make \u201ctactical advances\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/10/russia-wagner-group-fighting-heavy-bloody-battles-control-soledar\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/10/donkeys-neglected-animal-deserve-their-moment", "title": "Donkeys, a neglected animal, are having a moment \u2013 and they deserve it | Maeve Higgins", "date_published": "2023-01-10 11:12:08+00:00", "description": "<p>They might seem like creatures who plod along thoughtlessly, but people who care for them know better</p><p>Donkeys are having a moment, not that they care.
