Much more of this and Gallowgate Enders will be convinced Howe really can walk on the Tyne.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/10/newcastle-leicester-carabao-cup-quarter-final-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## Brazil’s attempted coup was thwarted by Lula’s decisive action, minister says

<p>Alexandre Padilha says insurrection by Bolsonaro supporters was well-organised ‘act of terrorism’ aimed at toppling government</p><p>The insurrection that shook Brazil’s capital was a well-organised coup attempt that was thwarted thanks to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s swift and firm reaction, one of the president’s top ministers has told the Guardian.<br /><br />Speaking at the presidential palace on Tuesday, the minister of institutional relations, Alexandre Padilha, said he believed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/09/storming-of-brasilia-government-buildings-in-maps-and-videos">Sunday’s far-right assault on the three branches of Brazil’s government </a>was “an act of terrorism” designed to bring down Lula’s week-old government.</p><p>And Padilha said the insurrection in support of the former far-right president <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/jair-bolsonaro">Jair Bolsonaro</a> might have succeeded had it not been for Lula’s decision to order a federal intervention that put his administration in charge of security in the capital, Brasília.<br /><br />Ibaneis Rocha, the pro-Bolsonaro governor of the federal district which contains Brazil’s capital, was suspended from his post on Sunday night amid outrage that local security forces had failed to stop thousands of radical Bolsonaristas ransacking the presidential palace, congress and supreme court.<br /><br />“If the government of the federal district had acted as agreed with the minister of defense and the minister of justice, none of what happened on Sunday would have happened,” Padilha said, denouncing what he called “terrorist attacks” on the heart of Brazilian democracy.<br /><br />“Perhaps, if we hadn’t had a leader with the popular support and ability to build political bridges that President Lula enjoys … Brazilian history might have been different when it came to the attempted coup, [and] the storming of the supreme court, congress and the presidential palace,” Padilha said, noting how on Sunday free buses were laid on for Bolsonarista militants hoping to join the insurrection from different parts of the country. <br /><br />The minister also praised the unity shown in the wake of the attacks by the leaders of Brazil’s supreme court, lower house and congress, and Brazil’s 27 regional governors, who gathered in the rubble-strewn plaza outside the presidential palace on Monday night in a powerful show of support for Lula’s new administration and Brazilian democracy. <br /><br />“All of this was halted, it was stopped thanks to the firm response of President Lula,” and the pro-democracy consensus between political leaders of all stripes, added Padilha.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/10/brazil-insurrection-lula-bolsonaro-alexandre-padilha">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From Jodie Foster in Taxi Driver to Brooke Shields in The Blue Lagoon, are films that used teen actors for sexual roles heading for a reckoning? As Paramount is sued over Romeo and Juliet, we look at the scenes cinema and TV might want to forget</p><p>Spoiler alert: Romeo and Juliet does not have a happy ending. But Franco Zeffirelli’s adaptation of the Shakespeare play did – at least until recently. The 1968 movie was a huge commercial success and became a secondary school fixture. Its stars, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/01/olivia-hussey-romeo-and-juliet-film-franco-zeffirelli">Olivia Hussey</a> and Leonard Whiting, even briefly dated – a dream come true publicity-wise. But now it has emerged that the pair are suing the studio, Paramount, for $500m over Zeffirelli’s handling of a scene in which both actors, then 16 and 17, briefly appeared partially naked. According to the complaint, the actors “were told by Mr Zeffirelli that they must act in the nude or the picture will fail”.</p><p>As with the music industry, cinema has tended to gloss over such incidents with the “It was a different time” excuse. This could be seen as a concerted effort to keep the lid on what many suspect to be quite a can of worms. Hussey and Whiting’s lawsuit <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/04/500m-romeo-and-juliet-film-abuse-case-me-too">could represent the long-dreaded can-opener</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/10/first-day-sex-scene-teen-actors-playing-nude-jodie-foster-brooke-shields-taxi-driver-blue-lagoon">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Our cooks say you can get much of the effect that meat brings to a dish by using seitan, tempeh, tofu and TVP. Or move away from meat substitutes entirely and explore the natural proteins in pulses and legumes</p><ul><li>Got a culinary dilemma? Email <a href="mailto:feast@theguardian.com">feast@theguardian.com</a></li></ul><p><strong>What are the best vegan proteins, and </strong><strong>how should I use them</strong><strong>?<br /></strong><em><strong>Rachel, Sheffield</strong></em><br />Protein remains the part of the plant-based diet that non-vegans seem most sceptical about, despite there being multiple good sources, from pulses, quinoa, chia seeds and nuts to tempeh, and even some veg, such as broccoli and sprouts. As Richard Makin, AKA the <a href="https://schoolnightvegan.com/">School Night Vegan</a>, puts it, there are “three tiers” to consider: “You’ve got plants [legumes, beans, lentils], minorly processed things such as tofu and seitan, then really processed things such as plant-based meat substitutes.” I’m sure you’ve got the first tier covered, Rachel, and you need only visit the frozen aisle at the supermarket for tier three, so let’s look at the tofus, seitans and tempehs of this world – after all, they make for the interesting cooking.</p><p>For <a href="https://www.maxlamanna.com/">Max La Manna</a>, author of You Can Cook This! (out in March), tofu is king: “There are all sorts of varieties, which cover everything from breakfast to pudding.” Firm tofu is “probably the easiest to work with”, says chef <a href="https://www.alexisgauthier.co.uk/">Alexis Gauthier</a>, making it a good starting point. At his London restaurant <a href="https://123vegan.co.uk/">123V</a>, Gauthier finely chops it “to create a ‘crab’ meat texture for maki rolls”. Makin, meanwhile, marinades shaved tofu in dark soy sauce and spices, then grills it for doner “meat”. La Manna’s go-to is butter “chicken”, which involves tossing torn, pressed tofu in olive oil and cornstarch, and baking it at 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 for 15 minutes; for the sauce, he sautes onion, ginger and garlic in vegan butter, adds spices (garam masala, curry leaves, ground coriander, paprika), coconut milk and tomato paste, and simmers for 10 minutes. “Add the baked tofu for the last few minutes, toss and serve with rice.”</p><p>Got a culinary dilemma?

## The US must decide what ‘victory’ means in Ukraine – or waste even more lives there | Frank Ledwidge

<p>Its support is critical to the conflict, but the US is failing to learn the lessons of its sprawling wars in Iraq and Afghanistan</p><p>The just and necessary fight for Ukraine places recent disastrous wars of choice such as Iraq and Afghanistan into the squalid context they deserve. However, there are disturbing signs that western policymakers have not learned the most vital lesson of those conflicts – the necessity for clear objectives and an unambiguous strategy for success.</p><p>It may seem obvious, but it bears restating that this is a military campaign, and when it comes to military support the US is, if not the only player, by far the most significant. As matters stand the US has failed to articulate its war aims. We hear plenty about what the US “supports”, such as “<a href="https://www.state.gov/united-with-ukraine/">Ukraine’s territorial integrity</a>”. The US supports many things: <a href="https://www.state.gov/u-s-support-for-human-rights-defenders/">human rights</a>, democratic processes and so forth. These are not the same as its war aims. Nato’s aims in the Kosovo war of 1999, for example, were clear: Serbian forces out of Kosovo; a peacekeeping force and international civilian administration deployed; and a return of refugees. The objectives of the Gulf war of 1991 were even simpler: to expel Iraqi forces from Iraq. It is worth remembering, and not coincidental, that these were the west’s last successful military campaigns.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/10/us-victory-ukraine-lives-conflict-war-iraq-afghanistan">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The book is out and as the royal gone awol speaks his truth, you have to ask: if this is Britain’s first family, what are the others like? </p><p>Day 127 of J.Crew Hamlet and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/10/spare-prince-harry-review-attempt-reclaim-narrative">Prince Harry’s memoir</a> has finally dropped. It needed to. I feel like I’ve had babies I’ve been less organised for than this particular arrival. There have, it is fair to say, been one or two thousand pre-publication spoilers for Spare, each of which a lot of people have consumed without really meaning to. There’s something about it having all taken place over the turn of the year that reminds you of eating nothing but Christmas food for days and days and days. After about a week of it, you do find yourself screaming: “I never want to see this stuff again! Can we please, PLEASE have a Chinese or a curry?” That said, I do still have one box of mince pies and one royal tell-all left, and I think we both know I’m going to get through them. It’s called duty – look it up.</p><p>Anyway, on to the reaction. As I type this, Harry’s entire home town of Montecito is <a href="https://apnews.com/article/california-flooding-Montecito-evacuation-order-7c151eeaf3f567a125d74245173327f1">under evacuation</a> amid floods some will no doubt choose to see as biblical. We can only guess how the book has gone down in Windsor Elsinore. Some judge that Harry has opened a hail of literary gunfire on a royal family whose courtiers constantly emphasise are limited in the ways they can fight back. Maybe this is a metaphor. As one of the more eye-catching passages of Prince Harry’s book reveals, during the conflict in Afghanistan he killed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/06/army-veterans-criticise-prince-harry-claim-killed-25-taliban-afghanistan">25 Taliban fighters out of his $50m helicopter</a>, a form of warfare which even the most committed Taliban-loathers among us always had to admit was a bit asymmetric. Then again, the Taliban won in the end, so we should certainly consider the possibility that the monarchy will be the last ones standing in the rubble when Harry’s barrage ends.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/10/prince-harry-one-flew-over-the-windsors-nest-spare">Continue reading...</a>

## The Breakdown | Inconsistent tackling of dangerous hits has Farrell teetering on a fine line

<p>Rugby union fails to reliably separate serious foul play from unfortunate misjudgments and is erratic with lengths of bans</p><p>The post-match summary was informed and thoughtful. “It’s a very fine line and I don’t think people quite understand when it gets slowed down on TV how quick those decisions are. You can slow loads of contact down and find something. When there’s a bigger collision people look at it more. Hopefully it goes in the right direction, the game is safe, and there’s some common sense, too.”</p><p>The speaker? Owen Farrell after the feisty Premiership semi-final <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jun/11/saracens-harlequins-premiership-playoff-rugby-union-match-report">between Saracens and Harlequins</a> last season. The game in question had four players sent to the sin-bin including the Quins hooker Jack Walker, for a high tackle on Farrell. The England captain, though, was keen to emphasise that top-level rugby has to be an all-or-nothing environment. “We know what we can and can’t do, but you still have to have enough intent to go forward in your defence. If you are constantly being passive you probably won’t get picked next week.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/10/inconsistent-tackling-dangerous-hits-owen-farrell-rugby-union">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Vernon Vanriel was a talented athlete who fought crack addiction, was sectioned twice and beaten up by police officers. Finally he ended up stateless in Jamaica. A new play tells his extraordinary life story</p><p>Vernon Vanriel thinks it’s ironic that a play about his life is now considered newsworthy. “For 13 years nobody wanted to know. Nobody wanted to listen to my story,” says the former boxer. Actually, Vanriel is playing it down. For many years, the British government refused to listen to his story. And what a story it is.</p><p>The play, On the Ropes, divides his life into 12 rounds. The 11th round was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/28/fight-of-his-life-boxer-trapped-in-jamaica-for-13-years-allowed-back-to-uk">exposed by the Guardian in 2018</a>. Vanriel was a victim of the government’s “hostile environment” policy and the Windrush scandal. Despite having lived in Britain since the age of six, he was prevented from returning because he didn’t have a British passport and had spent more than two years away in Jamaica, the country of his birth. The 12th round is the here and now – his life today back home, and the battles since his return.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/10/vernon-vanriel-windrush-boxer-who-lost-everything-then-battled-his-way-back">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Calvino ponders life, literature and the mysterious spaces in between in this rich collection of essays, reviews, interviews and more</p><p>Italo Calvino, novelist, essayist, critic, editor, publisher, lived a life that seemed made of words. Like his Baron in the Trees, the legendary aristocrat who escaped in childhood to the upper canopy of a forest, he often seemed reluctant to be grounded on terra firma, much preferring flights of imagination.</p><p>In the title essay here, the piece that gives this collection its guiding philosophy, he explains something of that habit of mind. In his youth, he suggests, he had the belief that fictional worlds could illuminate the real world and vice versa. As he grew older, however, he was plagued by the sense that while “within books, experience is always possible… its reach does not extend beyond the blank margin of the page”. The external world, meanwhile, remained to him a stubborn and unpredictable mystery, one that never stopped “surprising me, frightening me, disorienting me”. This predicament, Calvino argues, was particularly stark for an Italian. His was a country that in its politics refused beginnings and middles and endings, a place “where many mysterious things happen, which are every day widely discussed and commented on but never solved; where every event hides a secret plot”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/10/the-written-world-and-the-unwritten-world-by-italo-calvino-review-exquisite-flights-of-imagination">Continue reading...</a>

Now it’s time for Cage, one of the industry’s hardest-working, least fussy, but still notably talented thespians to get back to the business of making schlocky pictures to pay off back taxes or buy more dinosaur skeletons.</p><p>So here he is playing Colton Briggs, a character name with the kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretic">cretic</a> stress pattern that somehow suggests a warrior of yore. This being somewhere near the Montana territory in the 19th century, back in the day Briggs was a dead-eyed bounty hunter, his visage softened only by the fabulous minky voluptuousness of his handlebar moustache. Briggs briskly guns down a man trying to kill him right in front of the would-be attacker’s young son. Fast forward 20 years and Briggs has shaved off the ’tache and gone straight, with a pretty, doomed wife (Kerry Knuppe), an unnervingly dead-eyed little girl (Ryan Kiera Armstrong, strikingly good), and a store selling bags of flour and whatnot to locals.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/10/the-old-way-review-nicolas-cage-climbs-back-into-the-schlocky-saddle">Continue reading...</a>

Labour’s shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, clearly smarting from his brush with cancer two years ago, has realised that the problem with the NHS is not just cash but structure.

My besotted daughter is first in line</p><p>Since her father is a longtime music journalist and her mother is a musician, it was inevitable that my 10-year-old daughter would fall in love with music. But I never imagined that the music she would fall in love with would be enka.</p><p>Enka is often considered “traditional” Japanese music – its early roots are in the 19th century and most enka singers dress in traditional kimonos. But modern enka was actually born in the postwar period of the late 1940s as Japan was learning about western music from the settling US troops. This so-called “traditional” Japanese genre is heavily influenced by jazz and the blues, country, and even rock, with intricate guitar lines fused with the stringed instruments shamisen and koto.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/10/from-abba-to-enka-how-my-10-year-old-fell-in-love-with-1940s-japanese-music">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It seems unfair to ask them for something they may secretly dislike doing, but I feel as though my enjoyment is secondary</p><p><strong>My partner and I have been together for</strong><strong> four years</strong><strong>. We love each other, share interests and take pride in one another’s achievements</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> but we </strong><strong>have a mismatch when it comes to sex. I give oral sex to my partner regularly</strong><strong>: it is enjoyable to give pleasure, and I love to do it. I never receive it in return, though. I don’t see it as a quid</strong><strong> pro</strong><strong> quo, but </strong><strong>while my partner claims to enjoy giving it as well, </strong><strong>it </strong><strong>never happens. </strong><strong>I</strong><strong> have asked why, tried to be understanding</strong><strong> and would never push the matter, but I feel it </strong><strong>is a need that isn’t being met, as though my enjoyment is secondary. Lately, I find myself flirting more, </strong><strong>the thought at the back of my mind being that a fling might</strong><strong> end up with a greater symmetry of pleasure. </strong><strong>It feels unfair to ask for something my partner may secretly dislike, </strong><strong>but I’m led to believe </strong><strong>they do enjoy it, and am </strong><strong>left wondering if I</strong><strong> am in a relationship where I’ll always be the giver.</strong></p><p>You certainly are in a relationship where you will always be the giver … that is, unless you do something to change the status quo. After all, why would your partner start reciprocating when it is clear you never really expect it? People tend not to change their behaviour unless they have to, so, in not setting boundaries, you are encouraging selfishness. Ask yourself why you have not insisted on better parity before this. Perhaps a part of you does not believe you deserve to receive pleasure? Perhaps you enjoy the control and power associated with giving and not receiving? If we give another person too much – sexually or in any other way – we can begin to resent them. And receiving too much can cause just as much resentment, as well as an increased level of expectation. It’s never easy to create and maintain mutuality in a relationship, but it is essential for you to work at it without delay.</p><p>Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</p><p>If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to <a href="mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com">private.lives@theguardian.com</a> (please don’t send attachments).

<p>The former Australian Open champion is not competing in Melbourne this year, having rejected the grind of the tour</p><p>A long time ago, I took a part-time job in a high-street clothing store. It was late November, and amid the chaos of the Christmas rush I quickly discovered that nobody had the faintest idea what I was meant to be doing or whether I was actually doing it. One morning I overslept and queasily awaited the shrill phone call from a supervisor. It never came. The day passed.</p><p>More days passed. Days turned into weeks. The payslips continued to hit the doormat. If there was any faint paroxysm of guilt or shame at taking this multinational giant for £5.15 an hour while watching movies and eating toast in my pyjamas, then let’s say it passed. In early February, the cheques finally stopped. No words were ever exchanged between us. I haven’t set foot in the shop for almost 20 years.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jan/10/quietly-quitting-why-naomi-osaka-is-happy-to-drift-away-from-tennis">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In search of a family activity that is a little bit chilling, a little bit divisive and not that enjoyable? I have the perfect answer</p><p>On New Year’s Eve 2021, probably because some other doughnut in a newspaper said it was a fun idea, the family all wrote down predictions for the year ahead and sealed them in a box. When we opened them at the weekend, it turned out my son hadn’t done one at all, hadn’t even put a decoy in, and it’s a mystery how he got away with it, given we were all sitting right there. So now I’m looking forward to his career in magic. The youngster, even though 13 is not that young, misunderstood the concept of a prediction, and instead included her ambitions for a multiplayer video game that she no longer plays.</p><p>So that left three: I had said I thought Covid would be seen as no different from a cold, that nobody would self-isolate or even test any more, and everything would be completely normal. Mr Z’s was in two parts – Liz Truss would be prime minister, and Ukraine would be further annexed. The other 15-year-old had said she would always have £100 in her bank account.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/10/i-thought-new-year-predictions-would-be-more-fun-than-resolutions-big-mistake">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After allegations of impropriety and issues with diversity, the Golden Globes are returning but is the industry ready to take them back?</p><p>The moment Tom Cruise, recently re-throned King of Hollywood, decided to publicly boycott the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, it might have been wise to call it a day, the Maverick seal of disapproval hammering with nails a coffin already almost closed shut. But the HFPA, the controversial group behind the Golden Globes, didn’t flinch at the actor’s snub when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/may/10/tom-cruise-nbc-golden-globes-hollywood-foreign-press-association">he handed back his prior awards</a> in May 2021, and instead soldiered on, for better or worse.</p><p>Cruise was one of many big names protesting against the problematic practices of the group, whose shadowy dealings were brought to light in two ground-shifting exposés in the Los Angeles Times just months earlier. The group of journalists, long seen as both question mark and punchline within the industry, was revealed as both embarrassingly lacking in diversity (among its 87 members, not a single one was black) and guilty of “ethical lapses” with studios and publicists courting votes with gifts and trips around the world. A lawsuit filed by a Norwegian journalist denied entrance accused them of a “culture of corruption”. It opened the floodgates to more – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/apr/20/golden-globes-former-president-sends-anti-blm-black-lives-matter-email">a leaked anti-Black Lives Matter email</a> from a former HFPA president, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jun/18/golden-globes-two-members-resign-from-toxic-hollywood-foreign-press-association">members resigning</a> after labelling the organisation as “toxic” – and after celebrities, and their publicists, backed away, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/may/10/tom-cruise-nbc-golden-globes-hollywood-foreign-press-association">so did the US TV network NBC</a>, cutting off a deal estimated to be worth $60m a year.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/10/golden-globes-2023-controversy-jerrod-carmichael">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s lost 73% of its water and is unable to sustain some wildlife – and could soon negatively affect human health</p><p>Emergency measures are required to avert a catastrophe in Utah’s Great Salt Lake, which has been drying up due to excessive water use, a new report warns. Within years, the lake’s ecosystems could collapse and millions will be exposed to toxic dust contained within the drying lakebed, unless drastic steps are taken to cut water use.</p><p>A team of 32 scientists and conservationists caution that the lake could decline beyond recognition in just five years. Their warning is especially urgent amid a historic western megadrought fueled by global heating. To save the lake, the report suggests 30-50% reductions in water use may be required, to allow 2.5m acre-feet of water to flow from streams and rivers directly into the lake over the next two years.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/10/utah-great-salt-lake-collapse-imminent">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Suzanne Valadon fed hers caviar. Leonor Fini kept two dozen. And when Tracey Emin lost hers, the missing posters fetched £500 each. The writer of a new book about painters and pussies celebrates furry muses</p><p>When Tracey Emin’s cat Docket went missing in 2002, the “Lost Cat” posters she pasted around her east London neighbourhood <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2002/oct/12/art.artsfeatures1">were pilfered</a> and valued at £500. Her gallery, White Cube, argued that they didn’t count as works, though some art historians said otherwise. Whomever you believe, they still occasionally turn up on eBay.</p><p>It is Emin’s self-portrait with Docket that I love the most, however.

In the photograph, Docket faces the camera with that deadpan, slightly morose expression that is particular to cats, his impressive whiskers shooting out beyond the artist’s fingers, which frame his face as she nuzzles him from above. It’s a strikingly maternal image, and indeed Emin has in the past referred to the cat, who has sadly now left this earthly plane, as her “baby”.

<p>By turns sympathetic and absurd, this is a memoir that deals in the tropes of tabloid storytelling even as it lambasts them</p><p>The monarchy relies on fiction. It is a constructed reality, in which grown-up people are asked to collude in the notion that a human is more than a human – that he or she contains something approaching the ineffable essence of Britishness. Once, this fiction rested on political and military power, supported by a direct line, it was supposed, to God. Nowadays it relies on the much frailer foundations of habit, the mysteries of Britain’s unwritten constitution, and spectacle: a kind of symbolism without the symbolised. Ceremonials such as the late queen’s funeral are not merely decorative; they are the institution’s means of securing its continuance. The monarchy is theatre, the monarchy is storytelling, the monarchy is illusion.</p><p>All this explains why royals are so irresistible to writers of fiction, from Alan Bennett to Peter Morgan: they are already halfway to myth. And, it seems, no one cleaves harder to the myths than the royals themselves. There’s a fascinating passage in Prince Harry’s autobiography, Spare, in which he describes his father’s delight in Shakespeare: how he would regularly take his son to Stratford, how he “adored Henry V. He compared himself to Prince Hal.” Harry himself tried Hamlet. “Hmm. Lonely prince, obsessed with dead parent, watches remaining parent fall in love with … parent’s usurper? I slammed it shut.” At Eton, he was cast as Conrade, one of Don John’s comic minions in Much Ado About Nothing. To his surprise, he was rather good. “Being royal, it turned out, wasn’t all that far from being on stage.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/10/spare-prince-harry-review-attempt-reclaim-narrative">Continue reading...</a>
