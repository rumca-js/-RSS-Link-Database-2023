<p>Over winter break I resurfaced an old project, a harry potter trivia bot.  I rebuilt it using generative models instead of the extractive ones I had used previously.  The generative approach was far easier to implement and performed better.  Cheers.</p>

## Ask HN: What do you talk about in 1-on-1s with your managers?

<p>In BigCo for 6 months. Running out of things to talk about meaningfully in weekly one-on-one meetings with my manager.<p>I see it as a good opportunity where I get full attention. I don't want to just keep blowing my trumpet, or just complaining.<p>A week isn't enough time to get things done and 30 mins is not enough for deep dives.<p>Curious about how others have leveraged their time with the ones responsible for your promotions.<p>Edit: Just to add, I am fortunate to have a good manager, not complaining one bit. I'm trying to make some effort to make it worth our time.</p>

## Ask HN: At 45, I can't seem to read as well anymore

<p>Howdy HN Friends,<p>I've gone back to school into a medical degree.<p>However, I am realizing that I have trouble reading well. I used to not have trouble with any topic, but now I have to re-read text several times, I have to take a ton of notes (40+ pages per chapter), I am skipping lines and transposing characters.<p>I went to a specialist for academic learning and they did a battery of tests and told me my reading level is very low and were surprised I am even in a medical program.<p>I went to a development/behavioral ophthalmologist and they prescribed new lenses and cognitive eye therapy. The lenses seem to help but the eye therapy isn't.<p>I am at risk of needing to withdrawal.
Perhaps pausing this education is the best thing while I get this under control, but I don't see a path to start on.<p>Any advice?<p>Edit: I have talked with my advisor and instructors and they don't have advice except to seek more help, ask even more questions.<p>Edit 2: Taking no meds for the last 9 months, never had Covid, my PCP referred me to the development/behavioral ophthalmologist.<p>Edit 3: no alcohol, no drugs, no ADHD medications.</p>

<p>https://news.ycombinator.com/login<p>My password manager can't tell the difference between the login username text box and the new account username text box..  It fills in both, then sends an enter command, activating the button for new account.<p>I am a tester, not a developer, but I observed that the name id on both text boxes are the same. Maybe change the new account username form "name" to "new-acct-username" and the password managers might handle it better?</p>

<p>I’m a developer with an idea for a new type of personal device. However, my expertise is firmly on the software side.<p>Part of this device will involve at best some novel industrial engineering and at worst a new type of material being invented. (An analogy might be the Corning gorilla glass used in makijg the first iPhone touchscreen)<p>How should I go about finding someone to help me prototype the device, or understand if it’s even possible to make?<p>I’ve done Google scholar searches and some other limited investigations but that’s about as far as I can get on my own.<p>This person or firm could be a cofounder or early employee if it proves a viable idea. I just don’t know where to even start.<p>Any advice most appreciated.</p>

## Show HN: A different type of open-source alternative to Tableau

<p>Hello, guys~ I recently developed a data exploration and visualization app which can be used as a different type of open-source alternative to Tableau. It is extremely easy to embed in your apps just as a react component. The original purpose is to develop a lite plugin that can be easily embedded in most cases, it doesn't have to be a large BI, but a lite graphic plugin.<p>GitHub: Kanaries/graphic-walker, <a href="https://github.com/Kanaries/graphic-walker">https://github.com/Kanaries/graphic-walker</a><p>The main features implemented:
* A user-friendly drag-and-drop-based interaction for exploratory data analysis with visualizations.
* A grammar of graphics-based visual analytic user interface where users can build visualization from low-level visual channel encodings.
* A Data Explainer explains why some patterns occur / what may cause them.
* Using web workers to handle computation tasks which allows you to use it as a pure front-end app.
And you can use it in your app as a react component:h me in github or discord.<p>Feedbacks and advice are welcome! Discuss with me in github or  discord!</p>

## Ask HN: I'm 40 and feel my mental ability declining. Programming seems harder

<p>I'm around 40 and recently I have been asked to port an API from one language to another. The code I'm porting is average code, not terrible, but plenty of little things to complain about.<p>I feel like my past self could have handled this task, but I am really struggling. Porting this API will require a deep understanding of the existing API, which, of course, has several layers of abstraction.<p>I can't seem to hold more than about 2 levels of call stack in my head. There's the entry point function which calls other functions, which call other functions, which call other functions, etc. You know how it is, code calls other code, and logically it forms a tree of calls and return values that often goes several layers deep. I struggle to hold more than about 2 levels of this call stack in my head. By the time I'm down in the weeds I've forgotten what I'm doing, what the purpose of the actual API call is.<p>I don't know how to break this into small enough chunks that I can understand it or make progress. Imagine I gave you the code for the sha512 algorithm, and a hash, and asked you to find the pre-image (the input). This is how I feel. Where do I even get started? How do I find even a single chunk of manageable work to break off.<p>The hard part is, several other developers are making progress on porting this API. Why can't I? What happened?<p>I don't know if this task is just an especially bad fit for me, or if my mental abilities are declining?</p>

## Ask HN: Other Devs, How Do You Deal with Socials, Blogging, etc.

<p>Throwaway.. because I don't want to tie my actual account to this one.<p>People - how do you deal with the ongoing requirements it appears that jobs place, such as social network involvement. To me - this means LinkedIn posting rubbish, Twitter bollocks, public GitHub repos for sharing - even the asks from employers to post here.<p>I, as a person have <i>zero</i> accounts anywhere, except for one here. I've been gainfully employed in industry for ~2 decades, and frankly I have neither need nor desire to have a "social profile". I speak at conferences when I want to, sans twitter, linkedin, etc. Moreso - I find the amount of developer advocate written blogspam (let's just call it marketing crap) only contributes to the web problems - and hence have started to block... everything, including my employer's search results (personally, with a plugin in DuckDuckGo and Google.<p>I'm not interested in writing blog things. I'm interested in continuing my ongoing work as a principal engineer, without marketing externally on the fakery of "how great we/I am/are", or "humbelbragging", or frankly any of the rubbish I keep encountering. I just want to focus on the things we're collectively doing to be successful.<p>So... how do you handle this?</p>

## Show HN: Ecode – A minimalist and fast open-source code editor

<p>Hi HN! I've been working on a code editor and I think that it's mature enough to catch some interest. It's using a custom GPU accelerated GUI written in C++. Currently implements some interesting features: LSP, terminal, auto-completion, linters, formatters, custom keybindings, plugins and more. It's a hobby project but still intends to be an alternative to other popular code editors like Sublime, Kate, Lapce, Lite XL (and takes inspiration from them).
The project was born as a playground for the GUI I'm developing (eepp GUI) and is advanced enough to currently be my main code editor, but it's a work in progress, and many features are still pending.
Some minor hints on how to use it:
Folders are used as project (and .gitignore is used to ignore files)
The wheel icon on the top-right has all the options you need (Ctrl/Cmd + M to show).
Some keybidings to navigate any project (navigation is keyboard driven):
Ctrl/Cmd + K = Locate Files
Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + F = Global Search
Ctrl/Cmd + Number (Go to tab #)</p>

## Tell HN: Airbnb has no system in place when a host cancels on a renter

<p>Today our host cancelled a place we booked 6 month ago with zero communication, at time of check-in.<p>We landed at our destination and ready to check into our Airbnb that we booked almost 6 month ago, for an entire month.<p>The airbnb is managed by a company, who I assume manages the entire building.<p>The host promptly tells us it's no longer available, and that we should accept their offer of either refund or another listing that's in a completely different location,  with no picture or reviews, but promised that it's "similar"<p>Of course, being hesitant, we said no thanks, we're happy with just a refund.<p>They proceeds to tells us to contact airbnb, and then ghosts us.<p>We open a ticket with Airbnb, calls them, and they proceed to give us the run around and tell us to just book another stay.<p>So what else are we going to do? be homeless for a night in foreign city?<p>So of course we try to book, except it's last minute and the only listings available are the once you must contact the hosts first.<p>Good thing we arrived at 11am and not 6pm. or we'd be literally f*cked for the night.<p>Why am I complaining?<p>Airbnb, you should do better.<p>I am a startup founder, I understand these types of situations has probably zero affect on your bottom line. So you probably never prioritized the need to spend engineering time "fixing" it.<p>You also probably look at your metrics and say, well these situations happen to <1% of our overall bookings, it's not a problem.<p>But PG says, the best startups are the ones who solve intense immediate pain for a small number of people.<p>Well, my confidence in you is absolutely shaken, and now I'm not so sure your position in the space is so infallible anymore. Because eventually this will happen often enough that "the small number of users with intense pain" will give arise to a newer and better version of you, and you will be legacy.<p>In the end, we booked another place last minute, had to spend 2x the amount and received a refund (well let's see in 10 days).<p>If I was in a much lesser able financial situation, I might not have been able to float a few thousands of dollars on my credit card, and may have literally ended up homeless.</p>
