<p>The movie Ocean's 12 was not as beloved as Ocean's 11, and people were not afraid to share their opinions when coming across one of its stars, Don Cheadle, on the street. Reflecting on the Ocean's series as part of a <a href="https://www.gq.com/video/watch/gq-iconic-don-cheadle">GQ interview</a>, Cheadle recalled how, despite the hate, it was the most fun to film of the three movies.</p><p>"The second movie is the one that people will just unabashedly walk up to you and go, 'Yeah, I hated that one. That one sucked.' I'm like, 'Cool, you just said that to my face like I'm not a person. But alright, thank you.' That was actually, for us, the most fun of all of them," Cheadle said (<a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/don-cheadle-fans-slam-oceans-12-sucks-1235482864/">via Variety</a>).</p><p>Ocean's 12 takes place in Europe and was shot on location. Cheadle said the production crew rented out the entire sixth floor of the exclusive Russie Hotel in Rome, so the cast and their families could avoid the paparazzi.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/don-cheadle-says-people-came-up-to-him-in-person-and-bashed-oceans-12/1100-6510466/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Completing quests for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/disney-dreamlight-valley/">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a>'s wide variety of friends is an important part of growing your biomes and gaining new items. In the case of Maui, completing his quest "Burying the Eel" can provide you with coconut trees that will help you with cooking quite a few dishes in the game. However, an unexpected part of the quest includes tracking down worms, which Maui informs you can be found near water. We'll tell you exactly how to snag them up below.</p><h2>Where to get worms in Disney Dreamlight Valley</h2><p>Though Maui informs you that worms are found near water, he doesn't specify precisely where. However, they're actually not hard to find at all--provided you know what to look for. Simply visit a body of water in any biome in your valley and seek out the sparkling digging spots nearby--which appear as cracks in the ground--then dig up some worms from them. </p><figure style="width: 3840px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4084683-disneydreamlightvalley_20230109185113.jpg"><img alt="Worms can be found at digging spots around the valley." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4084683-disneydreamlightvalley_20230109185113.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Worms can be found at digging spots around the valley.</figcaption></figure><p>Keep in mind that these digging spots look identical to the ones that can be found all around your valley, but the worms needed for this quest can only be dug up at spots near the water. That being said, it's still a good idea to dig up any other sparkling digging spots you find as you're playing, as they'll contain useful Dream Shards and Night Shards that are used in multiple other questlines and crafting recipes.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-where-to-get-worms/1100-6510437/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Out of the many resources in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/disney-dreamlight-valley/">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a>, Seaweed ranks among the most versatile. This fairly common material is not only a particular <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-critters-their-favorite-foods-and-how-to-feed-them/1100-6507145/">critter's favorite food</a>, but it's also used in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-recipes-list/1100-6507171/">cooking recipes</a> and as a crafting component for making fiber and more. Here's where to find Seaweed.</p><h2>Where to get seaweed in Disney Dreamlight Valley</h2><p>Seaweed is found by fishing anywhere in the water <em>besides</em> the ripples you'd normally use to catch fish. In other words, just cast your line in any body of water and reel it in for a high chance of snagging some Seaweed--though it's worth noting you'll often also find some common fish this way, too. You can also take one <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-how-to-get-red-algae/1100-6510428/">Red Algae</a> and break it down into five pieces of Seaweed, though that's not recommended given how extraordinarily rare the algae is in comparison.</p><figure style="width: 3840px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4084529-disneydreamlightvalley_20230109151519.jpg"><img alt="Seaweed can be obtained by fishing." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4084529-disneydreamlightvalley_20230109151519.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Seaweed can be obtained by fishing.</figcaption></figure><p>If you'd like to increase how much Seaweed you're bringing in while fishing, bring along a friend who specializes in that activity so that you'll always be scoring those extra resources.

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4084874-0.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>On February 17, the next installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe will arrive. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania will change the course of Marvel movies for the next few years as it will introduce the next villain, Kang the Conqueror, to the movies. Originally appearing in the Disney+ series Loki, a variant of Kang (Jonathan Majors) was keeping the universe in check by not allowing variants to create a multiverse. And <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-trailer-shows-a-darker-side-of-kang-first-look-at-modok/1100-6510430/">the latest trailer for the Ant-Man movie</a> dives even further into the plot.</p><p>However, from there, the multiverse was reborn in the MCU, and a variant of that Kang from Loki has appeared. He's stuck in the Quantum Realm, but he's apparently building an army and looking to invade the normal-sized world. The new trailer for the movie gave us new insight into the character, the Quantum Realm, and the threats Ant-Man, Wasp, and company will have to face in the film.</p><p>In addition to Majors, the movie features Paul Rudd as Scott Lang, Evangeline Lilly as Hope Van Dyne, Kathryn Newton as Cassie Lang, William Jackson Harper as Quaz, Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet Van Dyne, Michael Douglas as Dr. Hank Pym, Randall Park as Jimmy Woo, and Bill Murray.</p><p>Peyton Reed returns to the Ant-Man series, making this is the third film he's directed. Jeff Loveless is the screenwriter, and he's also working on the upcoming Avengers: The Kang Dynasty, which won't arrive until 2025.</p><p>For now, check out everything we learned from the upcoming Ant-Man movie, as well as a few shots of MODOK.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. Fame</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4084875-1.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>In the MCU, it's probably near impossible to avoid the spotlight. Since Scott Lang became Ant-Man, he fought the Avengers in an airport in Germany, got very big in San Francisco, and helped save half the life in the universe. (He also shared a taco with the Hulk, but most people probably don't know that.) So of course, he's famous and seeing him and Hope on the red carpet may seem shocking, but that's just how the MCU is evolving.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. Scott is a father</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4084876-2.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Because of being trapped in the Quantum Realm--as the rest of his bug-related team (except Spider-Man) was snapped away by Thanos--Scott spent a lot of time in the Quantum Realm during the blip, and his daughter, Cassie, aged five years. So there's more than likely a little bit of disconnect between the two, as Cassie didn't blip. The second Ant-Man movie showed that Scott is a great father though, so that will most likely continue here.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. Cassie grown up</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4084877-3.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>So Cassie is grown up, and she's showing promise as a scientist, thanks to some mentorship from Hope and her family. However, it seems like she's also in trouble with the law, as the first time we see her in the trailer, she's exiting a jail cell.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. The machine</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4084878-4.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>As we saw in the previous trailer, this is the machine that Cassie creates. It's a beacon sending off a signal, and someone or something who found the signal sucks everyone back into the Quantum Realm.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. Homage to original Kang</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4084879-5.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>In the comics, Kang is a time-traveling being with a blue face. (He's also the Pharaoh Rama-Tut, a descendant of Reed Richards, and the younger version of Kang was actually a superhero on Earth, but that's a whole other story) While Kang doesn't have a blue face in Quantumania, he does have a protective shield that gives him that look.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. Living With Yourself Season 2</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4084884-10.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Whether it's the Quantum Realm or Kang, we see Scott Lang split into two. Variants are being created before our very eyes, which was the focus of the Disney+ series Loki.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. MODOK</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4084880-6.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Yes, MODOK has finally entered the MCU--sorry Patton Oswalt, you're still MODOK in our hearts and on Hulu. MODOK is a Mental Organism Designed Only for Killing, a bizarre Marvel creation from decades past. He's a giant head in a floating chair and the ruler of AIM--Advanced Idea Mechanics. This is a think tank group whose purpose is to overthrow governments with their technology. They're bad guys.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>8. AIM Army</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4084881-7.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>We already saw MODOK and a couple of these soldiers in the previous image, so we're going to go out on a limb and just say this is AIM and that Kang is running things, not MODOK. It might not be called AIM, but that's about all we can go on. Regardless, Kang has an army ready for invasion--most likely ready to take over Earth. And in many ways, this group is a lot scarier than Hydra, as they have advanced weaponry, and there's a whole lot more of them.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>9. Lots of Ant-Men</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4084882-8.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>We saw Scott splitting into a couple of people, but here, there are dozens of Ant-Men running around--one of which is getting stripped apart like string cheese.</p><p>Later in the trailer, we also see a lot of Wasps, so expect an army of these two heroes trying to take on Kang. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>10. More MODOK</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4084883-9.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">MODOK in the MCU has his own battle mode, which we see here. He has a couple of weapons and is completely armored-up.</p></h3></p><br />

## Marvel Snap Patch Finally Adds Artist Credits, Along With Big Nerfs

<p>Marvel Snap burst onto the scene months ago with plenty of fanfare, but one major omission from launch has finally been corrected. The latest patch adds artist credits, along with other changes including significant balance changes.</p><p>Artist credits have been a major request since the game launched in October. Much of the game progression relies on collecting and upgrading core cards and various artist variants, rendering them in different styles. The lack of artist credits struck comic fans as a major oversight, and one that had been partially corrected by naming certain variants after the artist like the wide variety of Dan Hipp variants. With the new patch, you should be able to see the artist credit for any card by tapping the Variant label above the card in your collection.</p><p>The patch also makes some significant balance changes to various cards that have been dominating the meta. Aero, Galactus, Leader,  and Nova have all had their power bumped down for various reasons. Second Dinner says it is evaluating whether to make further changes to Galactus, and exploring further changes to Leader. The distinction, according to chief development officer Ben Brode, is that <a href="https://twitter.com/bbrode/status/1610777791754309633">further Leader changes are definitely coming</a> and the team is simply deciding what they will be. Leader has been a particularly divisive card at high-level play, since it imitates your opponent's play while also adding its own power to the board.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-snap-patch-finally-adds-artist-credits-along-with-big-nerfs/1100-6510455/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Have you ever wondered what your favorite NFL team would look like as a Call of Duty crossover? Well, thanks to AI, we now know the answer. Though it's not clear who originally created (or generated) these images, they've made the rounds on social media in the past few days, and they're quite funny.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">This AI generated how NFL teams would look in “Call Of Duty”<br />Who has the hardest uniforms?? 🤔 <a href="https://t.co/H2vn71lfmW">pic.twitter.com/H2vn71lfmW</a></p>  — Daily Loud (@DailyLoud) <a href="https://twitter.com/DailyLoud/status/1612143680995069952?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">January 8, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">The images include 28 of the NFL's 32 teams. Of the current crop, the Raiders, Falcons, and Saints actually look like skins you could buy in a Call of Duty game right now. Others--like the Dolphins, Titans, and Bears--look like they could use a second pass before they're ready for the big time. The Patriots and the Cowboys both look like tacticool versions of Captain America, which seems on-point.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Call of Duty news, Warzone 2 and Modern Warfare 2 will begin their joint <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-2-and-modern-warfare-2-season-2-start-times-and-details/1100-6510296/">Season 2</a> around February 1.

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> Chapter 4 Season 1 has been widely praised by fans as one of the battle royale's best outings yet, and some of that can be attributed to its smorgasbord of fun new items. Among these exciting additions is the mobility-based <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-where-to-get-the-shockwave-hammer-and-how-to-use-it/1100-6509693/">Shockwave Hammer</a>, which allows players to bounce across the map and slam down on unsuspecting targets. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-controversial-shock-hammer-removed-due-to-community-backlash/1100-6510424/">Epic temporarily disabled the hammer</a> a few days ago after discovering an exploit, but it's back in action as of Tuesday, Jan 10--alongside the <strong>unvaulted Burst Assault Rifle</strong>--so you're free to proceed with all of your bouncy fun. As for the return of the Burst Assault Rifle, here's what you need to know.</p><h2>Where to get the Burst Assault Rifle and how it works</h2><p>The Burst Assault Rifle is, as its name so obviously implies, a burst-fire rifle that provides high accuracy when spacing shots out. It uses medium ammo and comes in <strong>Common (122 DPS)</strong>, <strong>Uncommon (126 DPS)</strong>, <strong>Rare (134 DPS)</strong>, <strong>Epic (142 DPS)</strong>, and <strong>Legendary (146 DPS)</strong> rarities. As with most normal weapons, it can be found just about anywhere, including on the ground, in chests, and even from fishing.</p><p>While it's a great option for medium-range engagements, the Burst Assault Rifle doesn't typically work as well when dealing with enemies up close, nor in extremely long-range shootouts. If you can find the right range to make the most of its accuracy, though, its high headshot damage can be devastating to your opponents. Just be sure to carry something like an SMG or shotgun around with you for when you get pushed at close-range, as missing bursts from the rifle in close quarters will be very punishing and likely result in an unnecessary death.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fornite-shockwave-hammer-returns-alongside-unvaulted-burst-assault-rifle/1100-6510451/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

The game will launch with Aang's storyline, but will eventually introduce campaigns centering Avatars from both before and after Aang's tenure, including Korra, previous Avatars shown or referenced in the shows, as well as brand new Avatars.</p><p>Avatar Generations's newly released trailer shows off the game's battles, visual novel style cutscenes, a world map, and a variety of playable characters, including Aang's companions Zuko, Katara, Toph, and Sokka, as well as mentor characters like Uncle Iroh and Pakku. Players can expect to fight enemies like Fire Nation guards, brigands, and even platypus bears. The final part of the trailer teases future Avatar additions, such as Aang's predecessor Roku, certified big lady Kyoshi, sadboy Kuruk, and the serenely fierce Yangchen.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avatar-generations-adapts-the-classic-animated-series-into-a-free-to-play-mobile-rpg/1100-6510422/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## The Last Of Us (HBO Show) Review - Faithful, Additive, And Excellent

<p dir="ltr">The Last of Us is often heralded as a crowning achievement in storytelling, but that praise is sometimes couched in a common derogatory caveat aimed at many other games, too: "It's a great story--<em>for a video game</em>." The Last of Us on HBO, co-run by Chernobyl's Craig Mazin and the game series' own Neil Druckmann, is a marvelous proof of concept for PlayStation--and really any brand seeking to bring its beloved games to prestige television. Whereas the history of video game adaptations is littered with abject disasters at worst and lovable family movies at best, The Last of Us proves this is a beautiful and gut-wrenching story regardless of the medium. While it's a notch below both the heights of the incredible original game and HBO's illustrious best efforts, make no mistake: The Last of Us on HBO feels like the beginning of a new era for live-action video game adaptations.</p><p dir="ltr">The post-apocalyptic drama series stars Pedro Pascal (The Mandalorian) and Bella Ramsey (Game of Thrones) as Joel and Ellie, an unlikely duo traversing an American wasteland 20 years after a fungal pandemic destroys the world as we know it. The pair sets off on what is initially pitched as a cargo run, with the 14-year-old Ellie being the so-called cargo, and focuses on their relationship, as well as that of others they meet along the way. On HBO, the grave setting and broken humans at the forefront of the story sit comfortably atop the morally gray foundation that prestige TV has been built on since Tony Soprano first stepped into Dr. Melfi's office almost 25 years ago.</p><p dir="ltr">The show, on the whole, is very faithful to the game. As someone who has played the game more than half a dozen times, I wondered how it would seem to fresh eyes. Often, the TV series delivers a scene that is nearly a shot-for-shot replica of the game, from the dialogue to even the cadence of its delivery. In the premiere episode, when Joel's daughter Sarah jokes with her dad that she sold "hardcore drugs" to afford to fix his watch as a birthday gift, she says it precisely the same way players will already have heard. When she later awakens in the middle of the story's first fateful night, she calls out for Joel twice in a tone that sounds uncannily like her video game counterpart. I wrestled with my feelings over these near-perfect recreations whenever they appeared. Was it beneficial to be so faithful, and thus largely predictable, to the millions who have played the game already? I sometimes enjoyed it, but other times found it distracting. Naturally, those coming into the show without any experience with the game won't have this issue.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-last-of-us-hbo-show-review-faithful-additive-and-excellent/1900-6418015/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
