While Microsoft originally planned a dual-screen Duo as their next-gen Surface Duo 3, that device has been scrapped, the site reports.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though my <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/545199/microsoft-surface-duo-2-review.html\">review of the Surface Duo 2 </a>was middling, I kept using the device for months afterwards, just so I could fully experience its strengths and weaknesses. Everything that the review stated is still valid, but I found that over time I just fell out of love with the two screens. Yes, in certain scenarios the Duo 2 excelled, such as placing Mail on one screen and the Calendar app on another. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in many cases, the two apps simply were random pairings, and not complementary. In this case, swapping from one random app to another felt arbitrary, and I never felt confident enough in the controls to trust that the phone understood what I wanted it to do. That uncertainty extended to the context switching between landscape and portrait mode, which altered the interface, but not always. For example, I really liked being able to flip open the top screen and watch a sporting event on the ESPN app, in landscape mode. But while the Twitter app or messaging would open on the other screen, the keyboard wouldn&rsquo;t. That meant that it didn&rsquo;t offer much of an advantage over any of the other traditional single-screen phones I had available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have no idea if a traditional single-screen Microsoft-designed folding device like the Galaxy Fold will sell, though the Fold and its competition argue that the format is a success. Microsoft&rsquo;s strength, however, has always been in its ecosystem of apps, and I would certainly expect that any device Microsoft launches will continue to be a showcase for what it has quietly and effectively done in the mobile app space. As for the hardware? That&rsquo;s always seemed to be less important. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s a lesson that Microsoft has had difficulty learning&mdash;Windows Mobile was a cult classic, but it ran a distant third to Android and iOS. When Microsoft shifted over to compete with the vast ecosystem of Android phones, it thought that the Duo&rsquo;s dual screens would be enough to differentiate it. They were not. Now Microsoft will have to come up with something unique to differentiate its offering from the other folding phones that are already established within the market.</p>\n\nSmartphones</div>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1450228/asus-drool-worthy-gaming-laptops-pack-extreme-specs-into-small-spaces.html", "title": "Asus\u2019s drool-worthy ROG gaming laptops pack extreme specs into small spaces", "date_published": "2023-01-10 17:00:00+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Tucked among the CES 2023 reveals of <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techadvisor.com/article/1445261/withings-u-scan-launch.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1450228-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">health sensors that you pee on</a> and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.coolermaster.com/catalog/immersive/station/orb-x/&amp;xcust=2-1-1450228-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">pod PCs</a> were this year&rsquo;s laptop announcements&mdash;and while they don&rsquo;t grab headlines in quite the same way, these upcoming releases still give hardware fans plenty to be excited about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take Asus&rsquo;s lineup for example. Its ROG gaming laptops span the gamut in size, with ultraportable 13-inch models on one end and astronomic 18-inch offerings on the other. But no matter the footprint, every single one of these notebooks sport incredibly beefy hardware. Long gone are the days of four-core processors and cut down mobile graphics. These laptops mean <em>business</em>, sporting top-of-the-line processors and ultra fast graphics.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can catch all of them in the video embedded above, including the astoundingly thin Zephyrus M16, which measures less than 20mm thick yet still sports a Core i9-13900H and discrete Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 graphics chip. It wasn&rsquo;t the only ROG laptop with Nvidia&rsquo;s top-of-the-line graphics chip, either. Full, untamed versions power the ROG Strix Scar 16 and 18, rated at a blistering 175W TDP&mdash;you won&rsquo;t have to make compromises in your game settings. And the Strix models boast plenty of eye candy on the machines themselves, too, with gorgeous RGB LED strips at the front and rear of the chassis, along with translucent paneling reminiscent of the 90s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be sure to also get the rundown on the company&rsquo;s two 13-inch thin-and-light models, the detachable tablet ROG Flow Z13 and 360-hinge ROG Flow X13. By their looks, you might assume they&rsquo;re underpowered, with mid-range processors and a half-step above integrated graphics, but you&rsquo;d be wrong. The tiny Z13 runs a Core i9-13900H and an RTX 4060 inside&mdash;leaps and bounds above what you&rsquo;d get from a similar-looking Surface Pro. Meanwhile, the X13 features AMD&rsquo;s newly unveiled <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444850/amd-launches-mobile-ryzen-7000-cpus-prepping-for-an-ai-future.html\">Ryzen 9 7940HS</a> and an RTX 4070. And as icing on the cake, you can link these laptops with one of Asus&rsquo; proprietary external GPUs. The RTX 3080 version is out now, and Asus is promising a 4090 version to come in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prices have yet to be announced, but we should hear more on that in the coming weeks. Good news is, you won&rsquo;t have long to wait&mdash;these juicy new laptops will start hitting streets in the second quarter of the year.

Newegg&rsquo;s currently selling the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/p/1TS-001A-06E27&amp;xcust=2-1-1468083-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Asus Vivobook 16X for $449.99</a>, which is a savings of $100. Not only does it have a taller display than most laptops, which is ideal for productivity tasks, but the dark blue color scheme is also really sophisticated looking. It definitely looks like a premium laptop (sans the premium laptop price). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hardware is great for everyday tasks too. The Asus Vivobook 16X is rocking an AMD Ryzen 5 5600H CPU, AMD Radeon Vega 7 graphics, 8GB of RAM, and 512GB of SSD storage. That&rsquo;s enough oomph for day-to-day and productivity tasks like answering e-mail&rsquo;s, browsing the web, spreadsheet work, and so on. The 16-inch 1080p display has an aspect ratio of 16:10, which is the perfect size for scrolling through work documents and the like. There&rsquo;s even a fingerprint sensor for additional security. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You better act now, as we don&rsquo;t expect this deal to last much longer. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"cta wp-block wp-block-button\"><a class=\"cta__btn\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/p/1TS-001A-06E27&amp;xcust=2-1-1468083-7-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Get the Asus Vivobook 16X for $449.99 at Newegg</a></p>\nLaptops</div>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1450067/asrocks-latest-motherboard-rocks-23-usb-ports.html", "title": "ASRock\u2019s eye-catching new motherboard bristles with 23 (!!!)

ASRock seems to be embracing that philosophy, because its latest motherboard has more than any we&rsquo;ve ever seen. The z790 LiveMixer (what?) includes 23 USB ports &mdash; you can count every one of them in Keith May&rsquo;s live CES coverage in your latest YouTube video. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The board is an attention-grabber even before you see the rear panel, thanks to a purple graffiti-inspired paint job plastered across its various shields and heatsinks. (The AMD B550 version will be orange, by the way.) But take a look at the back, and you&rsquo;ll see two USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-C ports (a third one is on the front), two USB Gen2 Type-A, four USB 3.2 Gen1 (and another four on the front), and a total of <strong>TEN </strong>USB 2.0 ports (six rear, four front). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;But wait,&rdquo; I hear you cry, somehow, through the internet, honestly it&rsquo;s kind of creepy, &ldquo;23 USB ports isn&rsquo;t enough to make me put my hard-earned money down!&rdquo; Okay skinflint, what about an eDP port and included braided cable, so you can <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1368914/asrock-wants-to-stick-a-whole-lcd-monitor-in-your-pc-case.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">plug in a 13-inch display on the inside of your PC</a>?

When executive editor Gordon Mah Ung checked out the Nvidia booth, he was blown away by the new <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1445469/nvidia-unleashes-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-rtx-40-series-laptops-and-more.html\">GeForce RTX 40-series laptops</a> that were on display. To show the difference in performance, the GPU manufacturer placed two Razer laptops with similar hardware next to each other. As far as performance goes, the new Razer Blade x16, which is packing an RTX 4080 and running <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, utterly demolishes the 3080 Ti notebook sitting beside it despite limited to a third as much power as the older GPU. <em>Wow</em>. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The RTX 4080 manages about 77 frames-per-second while capped at 50 watts and with DLSS and ray tracing on. That&rsquo;s a deeply impressive result. It really shows off what Nvidia&rsquo;s new Ada Lovelace architecture is capable of. The other laptop, the Razer Blade 17, which is equipped with a 3080 Ti GPU, churns out 64 fps at an uncapped 143 watts. Regarding fan noise, a common issue many gaming laptops have, Ung notes that the Razer Blade 17 is much louder than the Razer Blade 16.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of these new RTX 40-series laptops are shockingly thin, too. Many gaming laptops are bulky and often tip the scales at around five or six pounds. However, that&rsquo;s not the case with the Alienware x16. Ung couldn&rsquo;t believe there was an RTX 4090 inside of it, nor that Gigabyte managed to cram an RTX 4060 into a tiny 14-inch laptop. If this is the future of gaming, then count me the heck in. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more insights, check out the video above (and make sure you subscribe to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/user/PCWorldVideos/videos&amp;xcust=2-1-1468236-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">PCWorld&rsquo;s YouTube channel</a>!)

But as fun as stuff like <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1446954/aw-yes-we-can-buy-cyberpowers-insane-breathing-kinetic-pc-case-this-year.html\">CyberPowerPC&rsquo;s breathing PC case</a> is, it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily speak to common problems faced in the real world. For example, cable management. Just keeping everything relatively neat takes time, and if you try to make it look good, the effort can burn literal hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last May, Gigabyte partnered with Maingear to address this issue by getting rid of cables in the main compartment of their <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/705375/take-a-closer-look-at-gigabytes-wire-free-project-stealth-motherboard.html\">debut Project Stealth case and components</a>. Yes, all of them. It wasn&rsquo;t done through trickery (that is, clever cable routing)&mdash;Project Stealth made some radical (and dare we say smart) changes to the components themselves. Like moving <em>all</em> those pesky cable headers moved to the <em>back</em> of the parts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As frequent PC builders, the concept seemed genius to us. Such a seemingly simple design change makes for a huge impact on aesthetics build time. Even if you&rsquo;re not aiming for the sleekest build, cable management is still necessary; you avoid situations like wires blocking airflow or getting chewed by fans. But the internet didn&rsquo;t agree. There was a huge problem: The case had no airflow. By their standards, anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, y&rsquo;all can rest easy now, because Gigabyte gave you what you wanted. At CES 2023, they unveiled version 2.0 of Project Stealth&mdash;and it has a mesh front.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you missed the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/705375/take-a-closer-look-at-gigabytes-wire-free-project-stealth-motherboard.html\">Project Stealth coverage the first time around</a>, you can see both that perforated front panel and a fresh tour of the PC&rsquo;s innards, which includes a close view of the back of the motherboard and the reversed position of the connectors. You know what other problem this concept improves? Dealing with front panel pins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fun part is that you can actually get your hands on this PC&mdash;you can buy a version with a case, a Z690 motherboard, and an RTX 3070 for about $1,000. Hopefully this takes off; we&rsquo;d love to see more vendors hopping on board with component options, especially AM5 ones. And no, internet, it&rsquo;s not cute to say that people won&rsquo;t see cables if they buy a case with two solid side panels. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to see more videos like this in the future, be sure to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/pcworld&amp;xcust=2-3-1450153-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">subscribe to PCWorld&rsquo;s YouTube channel</a>!

After years of living in the shadow of Windows 7, 10, and 11, the day of its death is here. Starting on January 10, Microsoft will end its support, cutting off all future technical, software, and security updates. And to further drive the nail in the coffin, any Microsoft 365 software installed on your PC (like Office or Mail) will also no longer get security updates. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This lack of support makes upgrading to a newer version of Windows a huge priority. In today&rsquo;s environment, a lack of regular security updates is a disaster waiting to happen. If your computer still runs Windows 8.1, it&rsquo;s a massive risk now. Fortunately, it&rsquo;s easy to move on to Windows 10 or 11. And it should be free, thanks to <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/398636/tip-you-can-still-upgrade-from-windows-7-to-windows-10-for-free.html\">Microsoft&rsquo;s lax policies around free upgrades</a>. Upgrading to Windows 10 should be a cinch, though Microsoft warns that &ldquo;Most Windows 8.1 or Windows 8 devices will not meet the hardware requirements for upgrading to Windows 11.&rdquo; Fortunately, Windows 10 will still be supported until 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To ensure the most hassle-free upgrade experience, you should first prep your PC. Getting all your ducks in a row will make your Windows upgrade smoother, and it doesn&rsquo;t take that much effort. Here are four suggestions for what you should tackle now&mdash;plus one extra that can really save your bacon if things get messy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"toc\" id=\"back-up-your-files\">Back up your files</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"External hard drive on a table\" class=\"wp-image-624580\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/markus-spiske-hL8slYnc-bM-unsplash.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Backing up to an external drive works fine, so long as you have a separate second copy.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Markus Spiske / Unsplash</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Any time you mess with your operating system, be it a refresh, upgrade, or a complete wipe, you should back up your files. You can never predict when things will go sideways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, backing up your files <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/426736/3-easy-steps-anyone-can-take-now-to-back-up-a-pc.html\">doesn&rsquo;t take a lot of work</a>, and how you do it is relatively flexible. All you need to do is follow the rule of 3-2-1&mdash;three copies of every file (your working copy, plus two additional backups), two different kinds of media, and at least one copy off-site. This guideline isn&rsquo;t hard and fast, either, particularly for that second rule. It&rsquo;s fine to use <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/406861/best-external-drives.html\">two drives</a> or one drive plus <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407149/online-cloud-backup-services-carbonite-idrive-backblaze-livedrive.html\">cloud storage</a>. Just make sure at least one of those backups lives in a trusted off-site location in case things go awry while performing heavy OS upgrade surgery on your computer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"toc\" id=\"make-a-copy-of-your-bitlocker-key\">Make a copy of your Bitlocker key</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage center\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1448694\" height=\"526\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-4.png\" width=\"628\" /><figcaption>Saving your Bitlocker encryption key is the same in Windows 8.1 as newer versions, so if you run into trouble, you can still reference <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/back-up-your-bitlocker-recovery-key-e63607b4-77fb-4ad3-8022-d6dc428fbd0d&amp;xcust=2-1-1448683-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">this Microsoft how-to</a>.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve got a Pro license of Windows 8.1 and have encrypted your PC&rsquo;s drive(s), be sure you know where your copy of your Bitlocker key lives. And yes, you should have one already&mdash;creating a <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/439533/bitlocker-windows-built-in-encryption-tool.html\">copy of your encryption key</a> should have happened during setup. It&rsquo;ll be linked to your Microsoft account, saved somewhere as a file, or on a print out. Create a second copy too, for insurance. And if you never made a copy at all? Create two now, with each saved to different media.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, a note for just before you upgrade: You may want to suspend Bitlocker (that is, temporarily disable it) before rolling on to Windows 10 or 11. Usually installing a newer version of Windows over Windows 8.1 goes off without a hitch, but some people have run into issues when Bitlocker is active. You can reenable encryption after you&rsquo;re done. But either way, you should have a&nbsp;backup of your key!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"toc\" id=\"verify-your-computer-will-support-windows-10-or-11\">Verify your computer will support Windows 10 or 11</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage right\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1448691\" height=\"206\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-2.png\" width=\"399\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Upgrading to Windows 10 is pretty straightforward&mdash;most computers support it, unless you&rsquo;re running on ancient hardware (i.e., 20+ years old). It may not run <em>well</em>, but the operating system will install and work. But you can verify this by comparing your computer&rsquo;s specs against Microsoft&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-system-requirements-6d4e9a79-66bf-7950-467c-795cf0386715&amp;xcust=2-1-1448683-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">system requirements</a>. To get that info, hit the <code>Windows key + R</code>, then enter <code>msinfo32 </code>to open the System Information app. If your specs meet or exceed Microsoft&rsquo;s requirements, you&rsquo;re good to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Verifying compatibility with Windows 11 is more complicated, due to its more robust security requirements. Microsoft expects most Windows 8.1 laptops will <em>not </em>be compatible, but if you own a pre-built PC or a laptop, first try <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394835/can-my-pc-upgrade-to-windows-11.html\">checking what your manufacturer says</a>. If that&rsquo;s a bust or just not an option, you&rsquo;ll need to compare your PC specs against <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11-specifications?ocid=smc_marvel_ups_support_movetowin11&amp;r=1&amp;xcust=2-1-1448683-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Windows 11&rsquo;s system requirements</a>. A little online searching may be in order too, to confirm if your processor (or possibly motherboard, for desktop PCs) supports <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394765/what-is-a-tpm-where-do-i-find-it-and-turn-it-on.html#:~:text=A%20TPM%2C%20or%20Trusted%20Platform,use%20to%20boost%20its%20security.\">TPM 2.0</a>&mdash;the main barrier to installing Windows 11 on older computers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A loose guideline is that if your system pre-dates 2014, Windows 11 likely isn&rsquo;t in the cards for you. (If you have a high-end desktop PC, it <em>could</em> be a possibility, but you&rsquo;ll have to dig into your motherboard specs to figure it out.) But upgrading to Windows 10 isn&rsquo;t a hardship. You&rsquo;re not <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1448055/do-you-really-need-to-update-to-windows-11.html\">missing anything in performance</a>, and its user interface is <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/628743/six-months-in-windows-still-feels-too-half-baked-to-champion.html\">less divisive than Windows 11&rsquo;s</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"toc\" id=\"check-your-apps-compatibility-with-windows-10-or-11\">Check your apps&rsquo; compatibility with Windows 10 or 11</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1448692\" height=\"792\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-3.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Not all Windows 7- and Windows 8.1-era programs will successfully make the leap to a newer version of Windows. Others will require some additional software installation, like this awesome PowerToy from days past.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Though many older Windows apps work in Windows 10 or 11, not all do. Take some time now to see if your current apps will behave in newer versions of Windows&mdash;check the product pages for the software (and version) you&rsquo;re running, and look at chatter on forums and Reddit about their experiences moving to Windows 10 or 11. (Just search for the software name, version, and then &ldquo;windows 10&rdquo; or &ldquo;windows 11.&rdquo;)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you do discover issues, you&rsquo;ll be able to download newer drivers or replacement software now, and avoid unexpected (and unwanted) surprises in your daily flow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Also worth checking: </strong>Any peripherals or external hardware you use regularly with your PC. For example, we discovered that an older NAS stopped working with Windows 10, due to the OS automatically disabling older, less file sharing protocols (in this case, SMB v1.0). You may need to figure out workarounds, or in the example here, decide to upgrade to a newer NAS as to not compromise the home&rsquo;s overall security.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"toc\" id=\"extra-credit-create-windows-installation-media\">Extra credit: Create Windows installation media</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1448690\" height=\"474\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Save your future self from possible stress by having Windows installation media ready to go.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people won&rsquo;t need installation media for their upgrade to Windows 10 or 11, but you&rsquo;ll appreciate having it in case of emergency. You can more easily troubleshoot major issues, or in worst case scenarios, wipe everything and install a fresh version of Windows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating a USB installation drive for Windows is pretty simple. You just need a USB drive with an 8GB capacity (or larger), and the media creation tool from the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10&amp;xcust=2-1-1448683-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Windows 10</a> or <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11&amp;xcust=2-1-1448683-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Windows 11</a> download page. Install the software, plug the drive into your PC, and then follow the on-screen instructions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you plan on a free upgrade to Windows 11, make installation media for both operating systems. Since you have to first upgrade to Windows 10 (and get issued an active digital license), you could run into issues with either OS during the Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 conversion or the jump to Windows 11.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"last-step-upgrade-to-windows-10\">Last step: Upgrade to Windows 10</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With those crucial steps done, all that&rsquo;s left to do is <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/427723/how-to-upgrade-to-windows-10-what-you-need-to-know.html\">upgrade to Windows 10</a> (and then <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/542194/how-to-upgrade-to-windows-11.html\">upgrade to Windows 11</a>, if you&rsquo;re interested and your PC is compatible).

And sticking with the familiar could be costing you hundreds per year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternative providers use the same networks as the big companies, offering almost identical service but with lower prices, still no contracts, and often more perks. With a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), an unlimited plan can be had for as little as $30 per month for a single line, and $25 per line for group plans. And that includes 5G coverage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Light cell phone users can enjoy big savings, too. Where you live doesn&rsquo;t matter either&mdash;AT&amp;T, Verizon, and T-Mobile MVNOs all exist. The only real catch is that deciding on the right alternative carrier takes a little more consideration (see below), but we&rsquo;ve taken those into consideration when choosing our top picks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, not only do our selections cost little, but you can expect straightforward management of your account, accessible customer service, and little hassle if you chose to leave. A couple even toss in great perks, like free subscriptions to cloud storage or streaming services.

You also have to pay taxes and fees separately, which can hit hard in areas with high regulatory charges.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Need multiple lines? </strong>US Mobile&rsquo;s group discounts steadily drop the cost the more lines you have, with the maximum of four lines costing $120/month or $30/month. But the company further sweetens the pot&mdash;plans with three lines can choose a free subscription to a streaming service (e.g., Spotify, Disney Plus, HBO Max, and Xbox Live Gold), while plans with four lines can choose <em>two</em>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ad page-ad has-ad-prefix ad-article\"></div>\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"toc\" id=\"best-cheap-cell-phone-plans\">Best cheap cell phone plans</h2>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart product-chart\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-separator\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart-item product-chart-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper--title product-chart-title \" id=\"mint-mobile\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMint Mobile\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproduct-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper--medium\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Mint Mobile\" class=\"product-chart-item__image\" height=\"240\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Mint_Mobile_Logo.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1280\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__information \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"not-amp\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://mint-mobile.58dp.net/c/321564/444520/7915?subId1=2-1-431600-6-1441848-0&amp;u=https://www.mintmobile.com/&amp;partnerpropertyid=322172\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$15 at  Mint Mobile</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<ul><li><strong>Carrier</strong>: T-Mobile</li><li><strong>Cost:</strong> $15/mo and up (3, 6, or 12-mo plan)</li><li><strong>Data:</strong> 4GB</li><li><strong>Taxes included:</strong> No</li><li><strong>BYOD:</strong> Yes</li><li><strong>Hotspot allowed:</strong> Yes</li><li><strong>International roaming:</strong> Yes, separate pay-as-you-go rates</li></ul>\n\n<p>This Ryan Reynolds-backed MVNO may be best known for its green fox mascot, but it&rsquo;s more than a gimmick. <a href=\"https://mint-mobile.58dp.net/c/321564/444520/7915?subId1=2-1-431600-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.mintmobile.com/&amp;partnerpropertyid=322172\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mint Mobile</a>&rsquo;s ultra-affordable 4GB plan includes unlimited talk and text, free use of your data for mobile hotspot, and free calling to Mexico and Canada.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The catch?

You saved big on your cell phone bill by leaning hard on Wi-Fi for your data needs.</p>\n\n<p>But the best part of Fi was its inclusion of free international roaming in over a hundred countries with its plan. You could land in the UK and then hop between Denmark, Italy, and Germany without paying an extra dime&mdash;just your usual base fee plus data charges. All the hassle of obtaining a local SIM card was gone as well; you simply turned on your phone at your destination and went on your merry way.</p>\n\n<p>This feature is still going strong, with even more countries and territories supported (200+). Google has further sweetened its plan offerings, too. Data charges on its original metered plan are now capped&mdash;you won&rsquo;t pay more than the cost of 6GB&mdash;and there&rsquo;s also a $65/month unlimited plan with this kind of international roaming.</p>\n\n<p>While at home in the U.S., you can make free calls to other countries (Canada and Mexico at minimum, or more with the Unlimited Plus plan).

But the advantages are typically huge and outweigh the disadvantages.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"advantages-of-mvnos\">Advantages of MVNOs</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Cheaper</strong><br />MVNOs can save you as much as 50 percent or more per month, partially due to the many options available (so you can pick a plan better suited to your needs) and partially because of lower prices, period.</li><li><strong>Prepaid usage</strong><br />A traditional plan through AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, or Verizon is post-paid&mdash;you&rsquo;re billed after your usage each month. In contrast, MVNO plans are all prepaid; you&rsquo;re billed upfront and then use what you paid for. There are no surprises on each bill. If you run out of minutes, texts, or data during the month, you simply buy more.</li><li><strong>No credit check required</strong><br />Since MVNOs only offer prepaid plans, they don&rsquo;t require credit checks. No need to cough up confidential personal information or worry about your credit score. If you have money, you can get service.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"disadvantages-of-mnvos\">Disadvantages of MNVOs</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Lower network priority</strong><br />Network priority is all about who gets first access to cell towers for calls, texts, and data. Post-paid customers (those on traditional plans from the three big carriers) are at the front of the line&mdash;and depending on the network, they can even be split among themselves to determine priority. Carrier&rsquo;s own prepaid plans, subsidiaries, and MVNOs come after, and where an MVNO falls on the list depends on the carrier&rsquo;s own tiering system and the MVNO.<br /><br />In practical terms, that means that MVNO users may experience slight slowdowns or delays in moderately crowded areas. It depends on the network, your MVNO, and sometimes which plan you have, too.<br /><br />So if having first-in-line access is important, you may need to stick with a traditional plan. Still, a traditional plan won&rsquo;t help when towers are slammed with requests&mdash;like during huge sporting games, work conferences, or major disasters. You&rsquo;ll be more to the front of the line, but there just won&rsquo;t be enough signal for everyone.</li><li><strong>Limited domestic roaming</strong><br />Even when network priority isn&rsquo;t an issue, your MVNO&rsquo;s roaming agreements&mdash;for example, your ability to get signal from T-Mobile or Verizon towers when on an AT&amp;T-network plan&mdash;might limit your coverage. And not all MVNOs are equal in what they negotiate for your area. When possible, it helps to do a trial before committing. You can see what reception is like for the places you frequent and the areas you often travel through.</li><li><strong>Limited (or no) international roaming</strong><br />Most MVNOs offer limited international roaming. Some offer none at all. That said, most travelers opt for local SIM cards for better coverage and rates, or stick with Google Fi as the best of both worlds.</li><li><strong>Lower stream quality</strong><br />Prefer to stream in 1080p or higher? Be aware that many unlimited plans on MVNOs cap resolution to 480p (SD).</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">2.</span>\n<h3 id=\"what-should-i-look-for-in-a-cheap-cell-phone-plan\">What should I look for in a cheap cell phone plan?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>Some companies look great on paper, thanks to cheap, generous plans and slick mobile apps. But don&rsquo;t discount the other parts that contribute to your experience. Self-service is a big factor with MVNOs, and you want that experience to be as stress-free as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Easy, hassle-free number porting</strong><br />Ideally, transferring a number to an MVNO or transferring a number away from an MVNO should be quick and painless. Watch out in particular for companies that makes you work to get the info you need for porting out (i.e., account number and account PIN) or doesn&rsquo;t release the number quickly. (Or heaven forbid, both.) You don&rsquo;t want to be stuck on an MVNO with bad cell service <em>and</em> awful customer service.</li><li><strong>Straightforward website</strong><br />A website that puts self-service tools into your hands is best. We like Google Fi&rsquo;s site in particular&mdash;the important information is very accessible, and dramatically reduces the time needed for account maintenance or transfer. The less you need to talk to customer service, the better.</li><li><strong>Accessible customer support</strong><br />Sometimes things just go sideways with an account. Maybe you&rsquo;re not receiving texts, or you can&rsquo;t find your info to port out a line. Make sure that you&rsquo;re comfortable with the platforms customer support is most on (live chat, phone, Reddit, Twitter, etc), and that you know what to expect from them. (You can usually read up on the experience on Reddit.)</li><li><strong>Taxes and fees included</strong><br />Not all MVNO plans include taxes and fees, and these can be killer on low-cost plans for people living in high-tax areas. Maybe you&rsquo;re only billed $10 per month for the plan, but could pay as much as 60 percent more ($16) after factoring in regulatory fees and taxes. If you can&rsquo;t find a provider you like that includes taxes and fees, see if you can at least pay in bigger installments (e.g., six-month or 12-month plans). You&rsquo;ll typically pay less.</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">3.</span>\n<h3 id=\"what-about-prepaid-plans-from-att-verizon-and-t-mobile\">What about prepaid plans from AT&amp;T, Verizon, and T-Mobile?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>Currently, the prepaid plans available directly from the big three don&rsquo;t generally have the same price advantages or perks as with a subsidiary (e.g., Cricket Wireless for AT&amp;T) or an independent MVNO.
