As my friend Olivia said, <em>1776</em> was made as propaganda and has no business being as good as it is (it’s also more clear-eyed about American politics than <em>Hamilton</em>, but I digress). Plus, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqAdlkJDt7k">the movie version</a> has Mr. Feeny as John Adams — what a gift. </p>

  <p id="bNdUg9">Netflix is bringing some turtle power to its suite of mobile games by adding <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</em>, a modern take on the classic <em>TMNT</em> arcade games. <em>Shredder’s Revenge</em> was first released for PC and consoles <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/18/23172898/tmnt-shredders-revenge-classic-arcade-game-interview">in 2022</a>, but now, you can play it on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tmnt-shredders-revenge/id6443475072">iOS</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netflix.NGP.TMNTShreddersRevenge&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Android</a> if you have a Netflix subscription. </p>
<p id="7GqYhn"><em>Shredder’s Revenge</em> does a lot to capture the spirit of the old-school beat ‘em up games: it has beautiful pixel art, side-scrolling levels, and lets up to six people play at the same time. But the game is also designed to be welcoming to people who may not have grown up with the original <em>TMNT</em> arcade games, which might make it easier for new players to jump in.

## Marvel Snap’s bundle pricing is out of control

  <p id="fzJAl4"><em>Marvel Snap</em>’s first patch of 2023 is here. And while it comes with an interesting set of buffs and <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-snap-leader-nerf-change-leaked-patch-notes-2023-1849954315">long-asked-for nerfs</a>, it also brings a new bundle in the shop that’s finally causing me to give my favorite mobile game ever a bit of side-eye.</p>
<p id="dN8kJC">As mobile games go, <em>Marvel Snap</em>’s been really good about its monetization scheme. You spend $10 a month if you want that season’s new card / premium battle pass filled with premium prizes, which feels fairly standard. You can also spend money on gold, which is used to buy credits that cosmetically upgrade your cards. As you upgrade your cards, you gain collector levels that, as your level increases, reward you with newer, more powerful cards. While that does sound slightly like “pay-to-win,” you can...</p>

## Intel’s new Wi-Fi chip promises a better way to tether your Meta Quest VR headset

  <p id="31e2us">Intel and Meta have teamed up on a new way to directly connect your Oculus Quest headset to a gaming PC. If you buy or build a computer with its AX1690 Wi-Fi chip — and possibly others, we’re checking — you should be able to <em>directly connect</em> your headset to the computer instead of relying on your router to do the lifting (via <a href="https://wifinowglobal.com/news-and-blog/ces-intel-teams-up-with-meta-quest-for-low-latency-cable-free-vr-gaming-over-wi-fi/">Wi-Fi Now</a>).</p>
<p id="8DVZKh">If you ask me, the Oculus Quest’s coolest feature is that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22218827/oculus-quest-2-wireless-pc-vr-games-how-to">you can tether it to a gaming PC</a>, playing intensive titles like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/23/21188291/half-life-alyx-review-valve-index-oculus-quest-vr-shooter"><em>Half-Life: Alyx</em></a><em> or </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/21333148/star-wars-squadrons-preview-hands-on-impressions-release-date"><em>Star Wars: Squadrons</em></a> over Wi-Fi or wired USB-C.

  <p id="mLUqCQ">What’s been called the first cryptocurrency-related insider trading case has resulted in prison time for one Nikhil Wahi, who pled guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-10/ex-coinbase-manager-s-brother-gets-10-months-in-crypto-fraud?sref=ExbtjcSG"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/ex-coinbase-managers-brother-sentenced-10-months-insider-trading-case-2023-01-10/"><em>Reuters</em></a>. </p>
<p id="MJ2uJR">Last summer, Wahi was accused of getting information from his brother, a now-former project manager at Coinbase, and using it to buy coins before they were listed for sale on the popular exchange. This reportedly made him around $892,500 — which he’ll have to pay back according to the terms of his sentencing, in addition to spending 10 months in prison.</p>

Well, okay — hands-on time is a stretch. I was able to play one specific title on one specific all-AMD system in the company’s demo area at CES 2023 last week. But that does at least confirm that these chips are real and functional in this year’s gaming laptops. </p>

  <p id="YCHZWw">DJI has announced the DJI RS 3 Mini, a more compact and lightweight alternative to the larger RS 3 and RS 3 Pro gimbals. Weighing just 1.75 pounds (795g), the RS 3 Mini is the smallest entry to the third-generation Ronin series of stabilizers designed for DSLRs and mirrorless cameras. Being around half the weight and size of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/15/23168352/dji-new-gimbals-transmission-accessories">RS 3 Pro</a>, the RS 3 Mini should be a lot easier to toss into a bag for traveling and allows some users to shoot stabilized video with one hand. </p>
<p id="0IRg4z">It might have mini in the name, but the compact RS 3 Mini can support cameras up to 4.4 pounds in weight, so provided you can lift a little more than six pounds with one arm, you should be able to use this thing in just one hand.

  <p id="Ue4qfN">For decades, the Earth’s ozone layer, which protects life on our planet from the sun’s harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays, has taken a beating from common chemicals used in everything from refrigerants to hairspray. But now the holes in the ozone layer are diminishing, thanks to a decades-long global effort to repair it, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) confirmed yesterday.</p>
<p id="ra9dYa">Scientists first discovered a gaping hole over the Antarctic in 1985. A couple years later, countries around the world adopted the Montreal Protocol, a global effort to phase out “ozone-depleting substances.” And now, thanks to that work, scientists expect the ozone layer to start looking more like its normal, healthy self in the coming decades.

  <p id="eIzJ2O">The title for <em>Beau Is Afraid</em> really seems to nail the premise — at least based on the first trailer. The A24 film is the latest from <em>Midsommar</em> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/23/16924782/sundance-2018-horror-hit-hereditary-review-toni-collette-ari-aster-gabriel-byrne"><em>Hereditary</em></a> director <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/7/17427554/hereditary-director-ari-aster-interview-toni-collette">Ari Aster</a>, and it stars Joaquin Phoenix as a stressed-out guy who goes “on an epic odyssey to get home to his mother.”</p>
<p id="OINO2B">Apparently, that involves traveling through a papercraft fantasy world and meeting versions of himself from various time periods. To get the latter point across, the film features an <em>extremely</em> de-aged version of Phoenix that’s more than a little creepy, though <em>Beau Is Afraid</em> doesn’t seem to be quite as terrifying as Aster’s previous work. That might just be the trailer, though.</p>

  <p id="SoWw2J">Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase is the latest tech company to announce mass layoffs. In an email to staff on Tuesday, CEO Brain Armstrong said the company would be letting 950 employees go as it attempts to “weather downturns in the crypto market.” The email was <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coinbase.com%2Fblog%2Fa-message-from-ceo-and-co-founder-brian-armstrong-to-coinbase-employees&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2023%2F1%2F10%2F23548037%2Fcoinbase-950-employee-layoffs-ftx-fallout-crypto-winter" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">made public on the Coinbase blog</a>, and the company also submitted <a href="https://www.streetinsider.com/SEC+Filings/Form+8-K+Coinbase+Global%2C+Inc.+For%3A+Jan+10/21053577.html">an 8-K filing with the news</a>.</p>

  <p id="5CIDbE">What should have been a historic moment for the UK ended in failure last night after an undisclosed “anomaly” prevented the country’s satellite mission from reaching orbit. The <a href="https://virginorbit.com/start-me-up/">Virgin Orbit “Start Me Up”</a> mission was the first-ever rocket launched from British soil.</p>
<p id="UbvJJF">The first stage of the mission proved successful — Virgin Orbit’s Cosmic Girl (a converted Boeing 747 acting as a carrier aircraft) took off from Spaceport Cornwell on January 9th as planned and <a href="https://twitter.com/VirginOrbit/status/1612588012566679554">released</a> the LauncherOne rocket over the Atlantic Ocean at 11:11 PM GMT (6:11 PM ET). According to the live Virgin Orbit <a href="https://twitter.com/VirginOrbit/status/1612588341698125825">mission updates on Twitter</a>, the LauncherOne rocket experienced a successful stage separation and second-stage engine ignition.</p>

<p id="CpHkbK">First is that the feature is expanding to “most major browsers.” Currently, Google’s support page notes that it’s “<a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/4492226#zippy=">only available in Chrome browsers.</a>” Second is that it is being upgraded to “reduce transcription errors and minimize lost audio during transcription.”</p>

  <p id="hSVfEt">Google is adding a feature to Google Docs that lets you see non-printing characters such as spaces, tabs, and various types of breaks, the company announced <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/01/%20non-printing-characters-google-docs.html">in a blog post on Monday</a>. The option, which will be available in the View menu, can help make editing a document easier by showing you exactly how its formatted rather than making you rely purely on what you can see to tell whether something is a tab or a bunch of spaces. It can also be more helpful when troubleshooting messed up formatting.</p>
<p id="STDiUF">Before now, people have <a href="https://www.controlaltachieve.com/2017/03/docs-nonprinting-characters.html">had to rely on third-party add-ons</a> for Google Docs to see the non-printing characters. While it’s not a feature that many people will have much use for (more on that in a second), there was definitely demand for it. <a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/137189342">A...</a></p>
