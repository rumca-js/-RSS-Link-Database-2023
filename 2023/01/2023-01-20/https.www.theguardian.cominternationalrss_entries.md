<ul><li>Milestone will be hit when Liverpool play Chelsea on Saturday</li><li>Klopp: ‘I did the job I loved for the clubs I loved so I am blessed’</li></ul><p>Jürgen Klopp has said he feels blessed to have reached 1,000 games as a manager but believes his illustrious career would have been over before it had really started had he lost one more game at Mainz.</p><p>The Liverpool manager will reach the milestone against Chelsea on Saturday. Klopp has won 548 of his 999 matches, having managed 270 games for Mainz, 319 for Borussia Dortmund and 410 for Liverpool. “It is a massive thing, a crazy number – I feel really blessed,” he said. “The beard is really grey now, and that was not the case when I arrived here. I’m not sure if that is because of the age or because of Liverpool. I did the job I loved for the clubs I loved so I am blessed.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/20/blessed-jurgen-klopp-1000-games-as-manager-liverpool-borussia-dortmund-mainz">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Marisa Tomei narrates this sensational coming-of-age tale set in Naples, in which a young girl unravels her family’s secrets</p><p>‘Two years before moving out, my father told my mother I was really ugly,” begins <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/19/the-lying-life-of-adults-by-elena-ferrante-review-a-girls-own-story">Elena Ferrante’s The Lying Life of Adults</a> in an echo of Flaubert’s Madame Bovary. When 12-year-old Giovanna, from an affluent neighbourhood in Naples, overhears her father compare her to his hated sister, Vittoria, about whom he once said “ugliness and spite were combined to perfection”, her world is turned upside down. She had always sought the approval of her father, a leftwing intellectual and teacher who, in turn, took pride in his daughter’s studiousness. But in the early years of adolescence, Giovanna has become unsure of his love and of herself, and has let her grades slip. She knows little about her aunt, whose name was akin to “a monstrous being who taints and infects anyone who touches her”. And so, after leafing through old family photos in which Vittoria’s face is scratched out, she resolves to find her and discover the truth of her estrangement from her father.</p><p>Ferrante’s 2019 novel, an adaptation of which came to Netflix this month, spans three years in the life of Giovanna, and explores themes of class, faith, family and the lies people tell each other. The actor Marisa Tomei is the narrator, capturing the hurt and doggedness of the young protagonist, and the transgressive rebellion of the chain-smoking Vittoria. Giovanna’s path to understanding the adult world is often painful though, as the years pass, she attains a new wisdom, gaining power over adults and their deceit by telling lies of her own. <br /><br />• Available on Random House Audio, 10hr 21min</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/20/the-lying-life-of-adults-by-elena-ferrante-audiobook-review-faith-and-deceit">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Smithsonian Folkways)</strong><br />Stories of survival and self-expression suffuse this anthology exploring the ekonting, the three-string gourd instrument</p><p>Before the banjo, the instrument at the heart of so much folk, country and bluegrass music, was the ekonting: a self-built, three-string gourd instrument with a muted but characterful tone, played by the Jola people of Senegal, the Gambia and Guinea-Bissau. In 2000, ethnomusicologist Daniel Laemou-Ahuma Jatta demonstrated its uncanny similarity to early Caribbean and American instruments at a US banjo convention; alongside other west African lutes such as the ngoni, xalam and gimbri, it drives stories of survival and self-expression.</p><p>Ekonting music is a living tradition in west Africa, as this exhilarating 25-track Smithsonian Folkways anthology reveals. Songs by players of all ages were recorded in village squares, adobe houses and improvised studios in 2019, covering love, war, folklore, loneliness and protest. All explore the instrument’s capacity for being nimble, playful and melancholic, often at the same time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/20/ears-of-the-people-ekonting-songs-from-senegal-and-the-gambia-review-timeless-excellence">Continue reading...</a>
