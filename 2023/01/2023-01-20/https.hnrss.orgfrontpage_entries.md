## Show HN: Timeretain – Track, visualize, and export your hours

<p>Hi HN,<p>I made this because I needed to track how much I work and on what. Timeretain allows you to track time using a fast, private feed of time cards. It displays your stats next to it, and you can filter to zoom in on a description or tag. You can always export what's in view.<p>It's different from other time trackers because it's powerful <i>and</i> minimalist. Here's how I use it.<p>I need to hold myself accountable. I want to know how much I've worked in a week, and Timeretain immediately shows that — no need to create extensive 'reports'. Next, a log of what I did is useful for standup. I can get that from my feed, which loads quickly. Finally, I have to track time for specific topics. With Timeretain, I can add tags on the fly — it doesn't require me to create and manage 'projects'.<p>I would love to hear your feedback. There's an instant demo on the landing page; you don't have to share personal details to test.</p>

## Tell HN: Sometimes you don't realise how bad something is until you leave

<p>I was in two minds about writing this but in the end the thought of preventing someone going through what I went through is enough to tip the scales.<p>As per title, sometimes in life you don't realise how toxic something can be until you leave it behind, no matter that be a bad habit, a relationship or even work. Sometimes it can be so toxic that you'd consider ending it all (as i did) because there is no visible way out and keeping the money flowing in at the same time when people depend on you. I am here to say thats not the case. Good stuff can happen.<p>Under another name on here I wrote about my previous job and I felt stuck because if I left I walked away on a large chunk of stock options. That and my age made me feel really depressed and unwanted.<p>I was driven to actively contemplate suicide due to my boss and his shitty attitudes and issues but no one actually seemed to care. Even then I convinced myself with "aww, it's not so bad" when in reality it was absolutely horrific. Getting out of bed became a real battle. People bitch about people being too lazy to get out of bed but some of those people will not be able to get out of bed because they are so depressed they see no point in it because "it's still gonna suck". I was so sidelined that I could literally disappear for an entire day/days and no-one would notice.<p>I had a "top 10 dick of the year" award boss who didn't like me at all and proactively sidelined me so much it left me nothing to do on a daily basis. That said, in a large company you can cruise for years and that's what I did. The previous boss was a good guy but he left to pursue better options. Things where quite good back then actually.<p>Just doing nothing sounds awesome. It's not. It's crap. Imagine having to sit at a workstation for months and years, having to be "present" with nothing to actually do but make some some BS stuff to appear busy. Even doing training courses and such becomes boring after a while. It was a kind of mental prison and my boss truly didn't give a flying you-know-what. Imagine having nothing in your week to justify the normal desire to do something useful. I even wrote scripts to make life better but my boss wouldn't consider them because I wrote them.<p>Anyhow, it all came to a head and I ended up moving on... (cant go into that too much) and my new job pays much better money and is 500% more interesting and I get to play with cool new technologies. It makes you realise what crap you will really put up with and how from an impartial viewpoint you should have just "nope'd" out of it years ago but the status-quo is just easier to maintain.<p>Looking back at it I knew my time was up a long time ago but I didn't have the courage to jump. It caused me so much misery and anguish. Looking back on the experience, I wasted several years of my life working for someone who didn't nurture or appreciate talent with his sociopathic tendencies. It's only after all these things have happened that you realise the effects it had.<p>As an example, my faith in myself is utterly crushed. My new boss has recognised a lot of the mental snot has been virtually beat out of me and is understanding and I am grateful for that and is very helpful.<p>Recovery will take time but at least I know I wont get verbally berated every time something isn't perfect.<p>For those that this resonates with, I am not saying jump out right now but plan to just get out, even if a new job pays less or means going into a less demanding job. You can always make more money later but you can't get your time back. I suspect it will take years to get my confidence back but I am so glad to be out of a terrible situation.<p>It's only when you leave you realise how truly terrible it was. I am however still resentful over the lost years.</p>

## Ask HN: Has anyone successfully started their career over in their 30s?

<p>Quit grad school and spent my 20s at a chaotic startup where I learned nothing about how to intentionally build a business. I spent years running around like a headless chicken to satisfy sales-type execs who had no interest in leveling me up. I was a moron for staying on as long as I did.<p>I was eventually let go, and for the past few years have been doing on-and-off menial gig work. Feel like I’ve wasted my life. No marketable skills. Unimpressive résumé. No network. No mentor. No confidence. No motivation. And I’m in my mid-30s.<p>-Is there any hope for someone like me?<p>-Is there any reasonable path to starting over?<p>-Where do I even begin?<p>-Will tech co’s ever consider hiring someone like me?</p>

<p>Hello!<p>I'm building a typescript based frontend package to tag/categorize any form of textual input.<p>Straight to the demo -> <a href="https://open-taggy.github.io/demo/" rel="nofollow">https://open-taggy.github.io/demo/</a><p>Project focus:<p>- lightweight (frontend package without any backend server stuff)<p>- easy integration (currently npm/vanilla, frameworks to come)<p>- free and open source<p>It works on the basis of a pre-defined list of trigger words (glossary). 
With this approach there is no need for any external services or heavy backend/ML-things.</p>

## Ask HN: Where Are All the Parties?

<p>10 years ago, there were a lot of parties in my life, and now there are none. Where have they gone? Have you seen the same, and have you managed to revive your party life?<p>I remember parties at friends places, for housewarmings, birthdays, holidays, sports games, barbecuing, karaoke, whatever. I remember parties at work, for people joining the team, for people leaving, for projects kicking off or finishing.<p>Now my kids are older and it seems that only they get to party. I try my best, invited some people for parties, but we never seem to get invites in return.<p>Hypotheses I have so far:<p>- I'm just getting old (closing in on 50) and people my age don't party anymore<p>- COVID happened and we still haven't restarted partying the way we used to<p>- I'm just unlucky with my set of friends and need to renew my friendships<p>Very interested in both macro trends (eg is partying overall just down) as well as things that you've done at individual level to restart party life.</p>

## Ask HN: Why doesn't Apple bring continuity to the Music app?

<p>Apple boasts a lot about their handoff feature, but the one place where I need it most is when I play some music on my iPhone and want to later continue listening to it on my Mac. Spotify does a great job at that and that's been the main reason I haven't switched to Apple Music yet. Is there any technical/legal limit for Apple to avoid doing this?</p>

## Show HN: Music Audio Search Engine Using OpenAI's Embeddings on GPT Descriptions

<p>I am excited to announce a new tool for music producers and audio enthusiasts - a music audio search engine. With just a simple description of the groove you're looking for, our semantic search engine will output the most similar audio in seconds.<p>I used the Freesound.org API to upload over 3,000 grooves to MongoDB, and combined all the relevant data such as tags, title, description, BPM, etc. into OpenAI's Text-Davinci to generate a unique description of each sound. I then embedded these descriptions using the Ada Embeddings Model and inserted them into Pinecone DB vector database, making it easier to find the perfect sound for your next project.<p>This search engine is designed to save you time and make your music production process more efficient. Give it a try and see the difference it makes in your workflow. I would also appreciate any feedback on how I can improve the website and make it even more user-friendly.</p>
