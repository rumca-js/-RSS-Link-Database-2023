The final game update, version 2.8, is coming on March 31 with support for the game shutting down for good on September 30. </p><p>The team added that though developer support for the game is ending, both the single-player and multiplayer modes will continue to be available. The most recent content pack, which added the Winter Soldier hero and Cloning Lab Omega-Level Threat as part of update 2.7, will now serve as the game's final content update, with the forthcoming 2.8 patch only addressing balancing issues. The in-game economy will also be altered to reflect the new reality for the co-op superhero romp.</p><p>"When update 2.8 launches on March 31, 2023, Credits will no longer be purchasable and all remaining Credit balances will be converted into in-game resources to aid ongoing adventures."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-avengers-support-is-ending-but-all-modes-will-remain-playable/1100-6510754/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Players use Frey’s powers to navigate sprawling landscapes with parkour-like traversal mechanics, sling spells at hostile creatures, and hopefully prevent a world-ending crisis threatening the world of Athia.</p><div><div class="image-gallery__header">Walmart Has Big Discounts On PS5 And Switch Exclusives</div><div class="image-gallery__main"><div class="image-gallery__item"><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/1702/17023653/4089127-horizonforbiddenwest%2815%29.jpg" /></div><div class="image-gallery__item"><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/1702/17023653/4089096-animalcrossing%289%29.jpg" /></div><div class="image-gallery__item"><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/1702/17023653/4089097-demon%E2%80%99ssouls%281%29.jpg" /></div><div class="image-gallery__item"><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/1702/17023653/4089098-dyinglight2%2820%29.jpg" /></div><div class="image-gallery__item"><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_petite/1702/17023653/4089099-eldenring%2825%29.jpg" /></div><div class="image-gallery__item"><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_petite/1702/17023653/4089100-farcry6%2819%29.jpg" /></div><div class="image-gallery__item"><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_petite/1702/17023653/4089101-guardiansofthegalaxy%2815%29.jpg" /></div><div class="image-gallery__item image-gallery__item--show-more"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/walmart-has-big-discounts-on-ps5-and-switch-exclusives/2900-4590/">See More</a></div></div></div><p> </p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forspoken-preorder-guide-get-a-free-steelbook-case/1100-6501457/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/factorio/">Factorio</a>, the factory base building strategy game from developer Wube Software, is permanently becoming more expensive next week. Starting January 26, the base price will be increased from $30 to $35. According to the studio, the decision is to account for inflation. The studio confirmed to GameSpot that the price change "will apply across all platforms," including Nintendo Switch.</p><p>During its early access period, Factorio had a base price of $20, which was bumped to $30 back in 2020 once version 1.0 was released. Ever since, the PC version has remained at said price, except for the occasional sale. But as Wube Software announced today on Twitter, this is an "adjustment to account for the level of inflation the Steam release in 2016," referring to the year in which early access began.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Good day Engineers,<br />Next week, on Thursday 26th January 2023,<br />We will increase the base price of Factorio from $30 to $35.<br />This is an adjustment to account for the level of inflation since the Steam release in 2016.</p>  — Factorio (@factoriogame) <a href="https://twitter.com/factoriogame/status/1616388275169628162?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">January 20, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The strategy title has received dozens of updates ever since its 1.0 release, with the latest two being as recent as last week.

## The 10 Best Final Fantasy Protagonists, Ranked

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/679/6794662/4085626-ffvii-.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Over three decades after the first Final Fantasy took the world by storm, the iconic franchise hasn't quite lived up to its namesake. With a total of fifteen mainline entries--some with sequels of their own--and a myriad of spin-off games, anime, and other media, the series is anything but<em> final</em>. And with the success of Final Fantasy VII Remake and the hype surrounding <a href="https://howl.me/ciXEogeK8KQ?u1=subid_value">PlayStation 5's upcoming Final Fantasy XVI</a>, it's clear that fans' love of the property isn't going away anytime soon.</p><p dir="ltr">You could argue that Final Fantasy's excellent storytelling, vibrant settings, and engaging gameplay is what has kept fans interested all these years later--and you wouldn't necessarily be wrong. But most players would agree that the most memorable aspect of each entry has consistently and overwhelmingly been its diverse collection of party members, who capture our hearts and stick with us long after the credits have rolled. And the characters that tend to get much of that spotlight are the primary protagonists.</p><p dir="ltr">There's no denying that, as our party grows in each installment, we discover new favorite friends to adore--but it's the main characters that we begin our journeys with. It's these primary protagonists who we largely play as throughout the adventure and thus rely on to steer the game's core narrative. And as such, it's easy to grow attached to them as we watch them bare their emotions, develop relationships, and prevail against evil. Of course, it helps that they're usually pretty damn cool, too.</p><div><div class="norewrite" title="4581 - Final Fantasy Protagonists (FF16 Preorder)">    <div class="buylink__container">                                                                                                                                                                                               <div class="buylink__item">                  <div class="buylink__image-container clickable">                                            <img alt="" class="buylink__image" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4089200-finalfantasy16.png" />                                 <a href="https://howl.me/ciXEogeK8KQ?u1=subid_value"></a>                              </div>                   <div class="buylink__text">                      <p class="buylink__title text-bold">                        <a href="https://howl.me/ciXEogeK8KQ?u1=subid_value">Preorder Final Fantasy 16</a>           </p>                                                       <p class="buylink__deck">                          <a href="https://howl.me/ciXEogeK8KQ?u1=subid_value">Get a free steelbook case at Best Buy</a>             </p>                                              </div>                  <div class="buylink__links">                                                                                                                                                          <a href="https://howl.me/ciXEogeK8KQ?u1=subid_value">Preorder at Best Buy</a>                     </div>                         </div>                     </div> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">There are a lot of phenomenal main characters throughout the long and storied history of this beloved JRPG franchise, but rather than rank each and every one of them, we've compiled a list of the 10 best mainline Final Fantasy protagonists so far.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/679/6794662/4086511-vaan.jpg" /><br /><em>10. Vaan (FFXII)</em><br /><h3><p>An orphan with aspirations of becoming a sky pirate, Final Fantasy XII's Vaan spends his days dreaming of how he'll someday escape the grip of an empire that looms large over his homeland. Headstrong but empathic, Vaan is a likable protagonist who knows when to step out of the spotlight and let other characters shine. He may be the game's main character on paper, but it's his party members that really take the lead here, and Vaan's perspective is a perfect lens for us to view their stories through.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/679/6794662/4086510-noctis.jpg" /><br /><em>9. Noctis (FFXV)</em><br /><h3><p>From Final Fantasy XV's opening moments, it's easy to see that the bond between Prince Noctis and his trio of best friends is nigh-unbreakable. You could even argue that the real main character of FFXV is their relationship--but in truth, Noctis heads up the charge here as the stubborn and stoic archetype the series has tended to embrace over the years. As the game's story unfolds, though, Noctis proves himself a loyal and likable lead with depth and layers beyond our initial understanding.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/679/6794662/4086509-bartz.jpg" /><br /><em>8. Bartz (FFV)</em><br /><h3><p>The perpetually enthusiastic Bartz takes on the leading role in Final Fantasy V, and fans have long appreciated the character for his lighthearted demeanor and penchant for encouraging words. He's not the brightest of the bunch and is often slow on the uptake, giving him an endearing quality that sets him apart from some of the more mature or mysterious protagonists in the franchise. But if anything, it only proves that you don't have to always be quick-witted or sullen to be a lovable leading man.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/679/6794662/4086508-tidus.jpg" /><br /><em>7. Tidus (FFX)</em><br /><h3><p>Final Fantasy X features one of the most interesting collections of party members in the series, each with their own backstory worthy of emotional investment, but its main character Tidus is undoubtedly the core focus here. A teen with family trauma that has greatly impacted the direction his life has taken, Tidus finds himself wrapped up in something much larger than himself, but which might finally provide him the answers for which he's long searched. Relatable as he is occasionally annoying, Tidus is a charismatic lead who puts his friends first, isn't afraid to be vulnerable, and can play some mean Blitzball.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/679/6794662/4086507-squall.png" /><br /><em>6. Squall (FFVIII)</em><br /><h3><p>Squall begins Final Fantasy VIII as one of the series' most aloof main characters, showing limited ability to process his friends' needs and a strong distaste for the responsibility that falls on his shoulders early in the adventure. Despite his reserved demeanor, Squall possesses a strong sense of justice and desires to do what is right by himself and others. We eventually discover that his traumatic childhood has caused him to distance himself emotionally, allowing us to empathize with him as he learns to trust and embrace the love of his companions--and give it in equal measure.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/679/6794662/4086506-cecil.jpg" /><br /><em>5. Cecil (FFIV)</em><br /><h3><p>Though the three previous games certainly had their own memorable casts, it was Final Fantasy IV which first introduced a main protagonist that would truly enthrall fans around the world. Cecil begins the journey as a Dark Knight, blindly following the orders of a king despite his growing suspicions that all is not as it seems. As the story unfolds, however, we witness not only Cecil's transformation into a more fitting Paladin but his unwavering bravery, compassion, and devotion to his friends.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/679/6794662/4086505-lightning.jpg" /><br /><em>4. Lightning (FFXIII)</em><br /><h3><p>Surprising almost no one, Final Fantasy XIII's protagonist initially checks all of the boxes as an impersonal, independent main character. Indeed, Lightning isn't the most approachable leading character at first, caring little about how her actions impact others. But equally unsurprising is her development into a more compassionate and loving companion as she develops bonds with her party members. In particular, the relationship she develops with the young and naive Hope--who clearly views her as a mother figure--softens her and helps her to realize she can make room in her heart for her friends and still be the badass she's always been.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/679/6794662/4086504-terra.jpg" /><br /><em>3. Terra (FFVI)</em><br /><h3><p>Final Fantasy VI is unique in that it doesn't necessarily have a true main character, but it could nevertheless be said that Terra fits the role better than anyone else in the cast. Like many characters in the franchise, Terra begins the game on the wrong side of a conflict and soon finds herself joining a resistance to turn over a new leaf. Over the course of the game, we get to watch Terra evolve from a scared and uncertain protagonist into one filled with confidence and an overwhelming desire to leave the world a better place than she found it.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/679/6794662/4086503-zidane.jpg" /><br /><em>2. Zidane (FFIX)</em><br /><h3><p>Final Fantasy IX eschews the previous two games' dark and brooding main characters for a more straightforward and friendly fellow named Zidane. This crafty thief may start off with some questionable morals in the opening hours of the game, but he quickly shows his true colors as a deeply affectionate person who will do anything for his friends. Thanks to his affable nature and undying courage, Zidane has secured his spot as a true hero's hero and one of the franchise's most unforgettable protagonists.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/679/6794662/4086501-cloud.jpg" /><br /><em>1. Cloud (FFVII)</em><br /><h3><p>Few casts are as recognizable in the gaming world as that of Final Fantasy VII, offering some of the series' most beloved characters--from the pure-of-heart flower girl Aerith to the mysterious and murderous villain Sephiroth. But from the opening moments of the game when the train first rolls into Midgar and we see the spiky-haired Cloud lead from the roof, we know exactly who the star of this show is. Not only do fans love Cloud for his edgy looks and iconic Buster Sword, but his affecting tale of perseverance in the face of repeated grief and loss makes him a relatable character that players have been strongly attached to for over two decades. This tortured soul may not always sport the brightest or cheeriest personality, but his unshakable coolness and widespread fan impact have made him the definitive Final Fantasy protagonist.</p></h3></p><br />

## New Tencent MMO Tarisland Is Already Being Called A WoW Clone By Fans

<p>Chinese gaming giant Tencent recently unveiled its new MMORPG Tarisland, and it wasn't long before fans noticed it bears more than a passing resemblance to Blizzard's own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/">World of Warcraft</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Like WoW, Tarisland looks to be a fantasy MMO with an exaggerated, more cartoonish art style. There are paladins, mages, dragons, elves with an affinity for the color purple that live in a giant tree, and more. That, of course, wouldn't be enough to justify the clone label, but taking a closer look reveals that many of the game's characters and environments look to have borrowed liberally from WoW. The designs of the game's elementals, dragons, airships, and even some of the game's playable classes and races, in particular, all appear to be heavily inspired by Blizzard's signature style.</p><p dir="ltr">The game's announcement trailer even features a dragon that looks incredibly similar to WoW's Deathwing landing atop the ramparts of a city, in a scene that is extremely reminiscent of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Asmongold/comments/10gl3yv/tarisland_vs_blizzard_deathwing_comparison/">WoW: Cataclysm cinematic</a>. Tarisland even looks to include dragonriding, the big new WoW feature that just debuted as part of the game's well-received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-dragonflight-launch-cinematic-shows-horde-and-alliance-flying-side-by-side/1100-6509169/">Dragonflight expansion</a>.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-tencent-mmo-tarisland-is-already-being-called-a-wow-clone-by-fans/1100-6510745/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">After only a couple of months of availability, Netflix seems pleased with early returns on the streaming service's new ad-based tier. Company executives believe the low-priced subscription option--$7 monthly in the United States--could bring in over $3 billion each year in the future.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://deadline.com/2023/01/netflix-execs-advertising-tier-solid-start-viewing-is-on-par-with-ad-free-company-revenue-1235228191/">Deadline</a> reports that Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters talked about the success of the ad-based tier during the company's fourth-quarter earnings interview. He said growth of the new cheap option is "solid," bringing in new subscribers instead of current members switching. Additionally, their engagement matches what's seen from higher-paying customers so far.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're just getting started," Peters said. "We're constantly improving, and we see the trajectory ahead of us."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-with-ads-shows-solid-early-results/1100-6510744/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

The full patch notes can be seen below, but a few highlights include a fix for the annoying chat bug and battle pass issues.</p><p dir="ltr">One major change in the update is the much-needed fix for the chat bug that caused multiple player names to remain on screen when talking in chat. This was frustrating because it caused the names to remain frozen in future matches as well, and the only way to correct it was to relaunch the game.</p><p dir="ltr">While it may be too late for those who already completed it, fixes finally arrive to Season 1's battle pass. Players who still need to finish completing the pass should now experience fewer freezing and navigation issues. The update also introduces a new feature to highlight any unspent battle pass tokens.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-2-and-modern-warfare-2-patch-notes-address-frustrating-chat-bug-and-more/1100-6510743/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Only a few more weeks remain in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a>'s current Witch Queen era, and once Lightfall arrives, PvP is going to feel very different once the Strand subclass is introduced. Before that happens, there's still plenty of time to fight for a Flawless run in The Trials of Osiris. As usual,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-is-xur-today-january-20-24-destiny-2-exotic-items-and-xur-location-guide/1100-6510715/"> Xur will also be hovering around the Solar system this weekend</a>, so check in with the Agent of the Nine to see if any of his gear can help you in your quest.

As part of the <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2022/q4/FINAL-Q4-22-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">company's latest earnings report</a>, the company said it expects to roll out "paid sharing" to more users during this fiscal quarter.</p><p>The ability to pay money to share passwords will roll out "more broadly" in the months to come, Netflix said. The streaming platform said more than 100 million homes currently share passwords, and this "undermines" the company's ability to "invest and improve" the service, Netflix said. Password-sharing also hurts Netflix's ability to "build our business," the company said.</p><div>          </div><p>Netflix said it expects the crackdown on password-sharing, as well as the launch of Netflix's ad-based subscription tier, should help the company make more money in the long run.

<p dir="ltr">February is right around the corner, and a new month means a whole bunch of new content coming to Peacock. Some of that content will be available on February 1, while other shows and movies will be available a little later next month.</p><p dir="ltr">On February 23, Bel-Air comes back for Season 2. The show is Peacock's dramatic and contemporary reimagining of the classic Will Smith sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. The show was renewed for this season before the series premiered in 2022. A synopsis for this upcoming season reads in part: "Will is at a crossroads in his life as a new figure comes into his life who challenges what he's learned in Bel-Air and competes for control of his influence. He juggles this while navigating his home life with the Banks family and trying to rebuild the trust that was broken at the end of last season. We'll see Will and Carlton's brotherhood start to evolve as they grow closer, but still challenge each other about their differences." Check out the trailer below, which points to further developments in Hilary's relationship with Jazz, and Viv and Phil.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">Earlier in the month, Lowndes County And The Road To Black Power comes to Peacock on February 2. The documentary tells the story of the courageous campaign of citizens and activists who faced violence and oppression in the struggle for the right to vote in that Alabama county--which, at the time, was an impoverished rural region overrun with racial terrorism. Through first-person accounts and archival footage, viewers will learn the story of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee organizers who fought back.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-on-peacock-in-february-2023-bel-air-season-2-lowndes-county-and-the-road-to-black-power-john-wick-1-3/1100-6510736/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4089017-switch_fireemblemengage_screen_01.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Fire Emblem Engage is a deep and rewarding tactical RPG, and comes from a long legacy of strategy games that spent years pleasing fans in Japan before finally breaking big in America. Engage is the follow-up to Fire Emblem: Three Houses, a game known for its school setting and trio of distinct paths to follow, depending on which house you aligned yourself with. Engage is more straightforward, with a single story campaign.</p><p dir="ltr">However, Engage still has a steep learning curve. It carries over lots of tactical systems from previous games in the series, many of them with minor tweaks this time around. This game also uses a unique new Emblem system, pairing your warriors with the spectral forms of a dozen heroes from other worlds--aka other Fire Emblem games. To get the most out of Fire Emblem Engage, you'll need to master all of its systems, from the rock-paper-scissors of the weapon wheel to changing classes and managing your alliances in the Somniel. And of course, there's the entirely new system of the Emblem rings, which grants big benefits in battle if you know how to use them. </p><p dir="ltr">To get you off on the right foot, here are 14 things you should know before starting Fire Emblem Engage.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Strengths and Weaknesses</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4089018-switch_fireemblemengage_screen_06.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">The weapon triangle is back, and it's important to know every weapon and unit's strengths and weaknesses on the battlefield. Swords beat axes, axes beat spears, and spears beat swords. Simple enough, especially for long-time fans, but that's only scratching the surface. Physical attack arts are strong against magic users, dagger throwers, and archers. Meanwhile archers are super effective against flying units. One well-placed arrow can easily ground a pegasus rider. Meanwhile, the best way to deal with an armored unit is to cook them, <em>literally</em>. Direct a fire-based spell tome at one of these units and they'll burn alive. Spells in general are good against armored units, but in my experience fire spells seem to be the best.</p><p dir="ltr">Taking advantage of the weapon triangle and physical attacks also inflicts something called break. This causes the defending unit to drop their weapon and leave them open to another attack. Of course, enemies can also break your units, so be careful. Keep in mind that you can only inflict a break on an enemy if you deal damage. Occasionally a damage calculation will do zero damage. Even if you do have the superior weapon, you will not break your enemy.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Terrain</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4089019-switch_fireemblemengage_screen_17.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Terrain can play a big role in Fire Emblem Engage, and it's important to recognize what each tile does. First of all, you can see any terrain effects in the upper left corner when you’ve highlighted a unit. The most common terrain type are thickets that increase evasion and decrease movement. Most battlefields will have forests, or something similar, that will increase evasion, so it’s in your best interest to occupy those spaces and bait enemies out of them. Towers are rarer, but they can increase evasion and the occupying unit will recover 10HP at the beginning of each turn. Quicksand and shallow water will greatly hinder movement. Of course, flying units are unaffected by terrain entirely. They won't get the benefits or hindrances, but your enemies occupying those spaces will, so keep that in mind as you command your crew.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Baiting Your Enemies</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4089020-switch_fireemblemengage_screen_03.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Sometimes the best defense is a good defense. By pressing LR, you can see the exact range of your enemies. The purple tiles show you how far they can move and attack. As long as you stay outside that range, you should be safe. I highly recommend turning this on at the start of each battle and leaving it on for the entire skirmish.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're overwhelmed by the opposition, sometimes the best play is to fall back and let the enemies come to you. Find some decent terrain to bunker down in and go on the defensive. Some enemies won't rush you until you are in their range, though. I typically like to lead with a tank unit to bait the shy units out and then hammer them on my next turn.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Test Out Different Characters ASAP</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4089021-switch_fireemblemengage_screen_08.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Fire Emblem Engage introduces a lot of characters, especially in the early hours, and any of the characters you neglect will quickly become harder to use. Fortunately, when a new character is introduced you are forced to use them for a battle. I highly recommend running new characters through their paces to see if they fit within your core team of units, because if you forget about them it could take a ton of careful grinding to get them up to snuff. For example, I think Lapis is cool as hell. Unfortunately, I forgot about her and now she's way too under-leveled to participate in any combat scenarios. There are ways I could level her up, but they require a lot of patience. Sorry, Lapis. There's another universe where you're the star of my army.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Optimize Equipment</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4089022-switch_fireemblemengage_screen_13.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Sorting through multiple inventories is a pain. Thankfully, Fire Emblem Engage lets you auto-equip units with the touch of a button. You can do this on an individual unit basis, or before a battle, you can auto-optimize your entire active team. Be warned, though: This will remove all items from your inactive units, so if you decide to bring them back into the fray, you'll need to re-equip them. The last thing you want is your healer to roll onto the battlefield without a staff to heal.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Classes</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4089023-switch_fireemblemengage_screen_11.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fire-emblem-engage-changing-classes-master-seals-and-second-seals-explained/1100-6510731/">Fire Emblem Engage's class system</a> is deeper than ever. If you meet the proper requirements, any character can rock any class. In order to pull up the class menu, press +, select Inventory, then select the unit whose class you want to change, and select Change Class. Here you can see the level requirements, required weapon proficiency, and the item cost. You'll need a Master Seal for Advanced classes and a Second Seal for base classes.</p><p dir="ltr">Once you hit max level with an Advanced Class, you can change into any Advanced Class so long as you have a Second Seal and the required weapon proficiency. You can even use a second seal to reset a unit's current class in order to level it up more. Your stats will stay the same if you reset your current class, and they may alter slightly if you change to a new class. It's in your best interest to change classes once you hit max level. The worst thing you can do is let a unit sit at level 20 for an extended period of time, so I highly recommend looking over all the different classes and seeing what skills come with them.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Skills</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4089024-switch_fireemblemengage_screen_02.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Along with classes come skills. There are five different types of skills in Fire Emblem Engage: <strong>Inherited</strong>, which are skills learned from Emblem Rings; <strong>Personal</strong>, which are skills unique to that character; <strong>Class</strong>, which are skills unique to that Advanced Class; <strong>Sync</strong>, which are skills tied to the equipped Emblem Ring; And <strong>Engage</strong> skills, which are skills that can only be utilized while engaged. This may sound overwhelming, but in actuality, the only skills you can really mix and match are the Inherited skills you get from Emblems. Still, inherited skills don't automatically equip, so make sure you are equipping your skills in the Inventory menu.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Somniel - Weapons</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4089025-switch_fireemblemengage_screen_05.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">There is a lot to do in your home above the clouds, but which activities should you prioritize? These next few segments will tell you exactly that, starting with weapons and items. Weapons don't break this time around, but you can upgrade them with money and crafting materials. Technically, you can upgrade just about every single weapon in the game. Don't let this overwhelm you though. Basic weapons you acquire at the beginning of the game usually aren't worth the time or resources. Instead, I recommend only upgrading the unique and legendary weapons that you will likely use throughout the game. Iron weapons will be replaced with steel and steel with silver.</p><p dir="ltr">As for items, always make sure you're stocked up on Vulneraries (and later, Elixirs) and staves, which, unlike the weapons, will break after a certain amount of uses. A bit later in the game you can also purchase Master Seals and Second Seals, items that are incredibly important as you progress through the story. Money can be tight in the later half of the game so make sure you are saving some in case you need to make a last minute supply run.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Somniel - Emblem and Bond Rings</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4089026-switch_fireemblemengage_screen_29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">There are two types of rings in Fire Emblem Engage: Emblem Rings and Bond Rings. Emblem Rings house the spirit of a past Fire Emblem hero to fight alongside you. These rings are unmissable and obtained as you make your way through the story. Bond Rings can be purchased with Bond Fragments and give units small stat boosts. Both types of rings can be managed in the Ring Chamber located next to the Cafe Terrace. Here, units can inherit skills from Emblem Rings, you can craft and combine new Bond Rings, and you can polish your Emblem Rings.</p><p dir="ltr">Especially early on, it's important to inherit Emblem Rings skills from Marth, Micaiah, and Celica. There are a lot of important skills that you'll want to learn like Micaiah's Healing Wind. This will allow a healer to regain some of their own health whenever they heal another unit. Bond Rings on the other hand are useful early on when you only have a few Emblem Rings. You can equip these on your Emblem Ring-less unit for nice stat buffs. However, the further you get, the less useful these rings are, since you'll eventually have more than enough Emblem rings to equip on your entire active party. And, you will probably want to save your Bond Fragments for the Arena.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Somniel - The Arena</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4089027-switch_fireemblemengage_screen_15.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">After each battle you can return to the Somniel's arena and participate in three battles. For these battles, you pick one unit and that unit is pitted against another unit randomly. After each battle, the unit you selected will get some experience whether they win or lose and the bond between those two units will increase. Even if you are eager to get to the next battle, I highly recommend stopping in at the Arena after each skirmish just to get this free XP. It's worth noting that The Arena can't make a low-level unit viable, at least not in a reasonable amount of time. If Jean is still level one, he's probably going to stay level one unless you bring him into battle.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, you can also battle Emblems in the Arena. However, this works a little differently. By using Bond Fragments you can increase the bond between a specific unit and an Emblem as much as you like. It can cost a lot of Bond Fragments, but it may be worth it, as maxing out your bond with an Emblem can take a long time otherwise.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Somniel - Resources</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4089028-switch_fireemblemengage_screen_09.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Resources in Fire Emblem Engage are important. Particularly, metals used to upgrade your weapons. The best way to get a consistent flow of resources is by tending to your livestock. Up to five animals you've adopted can graze in the pen. The animals left out will produce resources after each battle. In my experience, dogs provide metals, while cats provide fish. There are a bunch of different animals that can potentially provide a bunch of different resources so pay close attention to what items you find next to your animals. I almost exclusively only keep dogs in my animal pen because I found metals to be more important than cooking ingredients.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also a bunch of other stuff you can collect at The Somniel between battles. It's usually in your best interest to pick everything up in between each battle, but this gets old fast so I'd prioritize your animal pen and the spring near Sommie. Here you can find extra bond fragments.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Somniel - Gift Giving</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4089030-4087174-img_5165.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">If you want to fast-track your character's relationship with another character, just give them a ton of gifts. All at once. Like 30 Pretty Pebbles that they'll have absolutely no use for. There is no limit to the number of gifts you can give to a unit, so if there's a character you like a lot, just shower them with obnoxious gifts. Just make sure they respond positively to your gift, otherwise you'll need to find or buy them something else. Keep in mind, your character is the only character who can give gifts. This means that if you want to increase Framme and Clanne's bond, they will need to fight alongside each other.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Somniel - Alear's Desk</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4089031-switch_fireemblemengage_screen_21.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">In the Cafe Terrace you'll find Alear's desk. Here you can donate to one of the four different countries and claim achievements for easy Bond Fragments. You don't need to return here after each battle, but it's a good idea to stop by after a big payday or after a ton of achievements have popped. Donating to countries will give you some resources and increase the rewards when completing a skirmish in that country. I wouldn't blow all your money on donations (like I did) because gold is tougher to come by in the second half, but it's still important.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Support and Bond Conversations</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4089032-switch_fireemblemengage_screen_12.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Along with Support conversations, Fire Emblem Engage introduces Bond conversations. These are basically the same, but show characters interacting with Emblem heroes. They are far less interesting than Support conversations, but just as important as they will increase the effectiveness between a unit and an emblem. In order to access both types of conversations press +, go to References, and here you'll find Support and Bond conversations. It's important to note that both types of bonds can't progress until these conversations have been completed. Make sure you check out this menu between each battle.</p></h3></p><br />

<p>At long last, the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) has <a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/Unclassified-2022-Annual-Report-UAP.pdf">released a new report</a> on UFOs, or to be more technically correct, Unidentified Aerial Phenomena. According to the documents, reports of UAPs increased last year, with 510 cases logged as of August 2022. This resulted in the Department of Defense All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office being formed to get to the bottom of these reports, although more in-depth details remain classified to the general public for now.</p><p>While ODNI isn't ready to confirm the existence of extraterrestrial forces using Earth's airspace as a dragstrip for interstellar hijinks, the report does classify UAPs as exhibiting "unusual" flight characteristics or performance capabilities. According to <a href="https://www.space.com/pentagon-2022-ufo-uap-report">Space.com</a>, 26 of the UAPs were classified as uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS) or drones, 163 UAPs were labeled as balloons or "balloon-like" entities, and six of them were sky junk like airborne plastic shopping bags.</p><p>Weather conditions, like lighting and atmospheric effects, can also be presumed to be UAPs. It's also worth noting that military aviators in controlled airspaces are registering more UAP reports because there are more sensors scanning the skies around military facilities.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/us-governments-latest-ufo-report-confirms-plenty-of-junk-in-the-sky-no-aliens-yet/1100-6510732/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fire-emblem-engage/">Fire Emblem Engage</a> revolves around the Emblems, 12 heroes from other worlds--aka other Fire Emblem games--that can be summoned into battle using special rings. These heroes include Marth, Lucina, and Byleth, and give you access to special weapons and moves, as well as healthy stat bumps. But how do you collect them all?</p><p dir="ltr">While the idea of a hero-collecting mechanic would seem to be reminiscent of a gacha game like Fire Emblem Heroes, that's actually not at all how it works in Fire Emblem Engage. Instead, in Engage, the various Emblems and their associated heroes are part of your story progress, so you'll naturally gather them all in a particular order as the story progresses. There's no way to miss collecting them all or work to unlock a particular one sooner.</p><p dir="ltr">So as to avoid spoilers, we won't reveal the exact order of the Emblems here. Sometimes when you get into a battle, your foe will have an Emblem Ring and the story will treat their associated Emblem as a mystery to be discovered. Other times, you may lose control of one ring and gain another.

## Fire Emblem Engage - How Emblem And Bond Rings Work

<p dir="ltr">In many ways, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fire-emblem-engage/">Fire Emblem Engage</a> is a back-to-basics turn for the tactical RPG series. The newest game removes many of the social elements and multiple branches of Three Houses, for a more streamlined, linear approach. It does have a significant new gameplay wrinkle, though, in the form of Emblem rings. These rings, which summon heroes from other Fire Emblem worlds, have major story and gameplay implications throughout Fire Emblem Engage. Bond rings, meanwhile, help round out the nostalgia by recalling other iconic heroes and granting benefits of their own. Here's how Emblem rings and Bond rings work in Fire Emblem Engage.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Emblem rings</h3><p dir="ltr">The headliner of the new equipment are the Emblem rings. There are only 12 total, and you unlock them in a linear order as the story progresses. Each of these features a glowing blue specter of another Fire Emblem Game, each with their own abilities. Those 12 are, in no particular order:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Marth</li><li dir="ltr">Lucina</li><li dir="ltr">Roy</li><li dir="ltr">Celica</li><li dir="ltr">Sigurd</li><li dir="ltr">Leif</li><li dir="ltr">Lyn</li><li dir="ltr">Erika</li><li dir="ltr">Ike</li><li dir="ltr">Micaiah</li><li dir="ltr">Corrin</li><li dir="ltr">Byleth</li></ul><p dir="ltr">These rings have a major impact on the story, as the warring factions are fighting in part for control of the rings that could turn the tide of the conflict. But they also have gameplay implications, as each Emblem has its own suite of special abilities and attacks that can be used when you equip it on one of your characters. The Emblems specialize in different types of weapons, so to maximize their utility, you'll want to equip them on characters that complement their skills. Lyn, for example, is an Archer and would be best suited on a ranged unit, since they'll make the most of her abilities. Emblem ring abilities come in three types:</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fire-emblem-engage-how-emblem-and-bond-rings-work/1100-6510733/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fire-emblem-engage/">Fire Emblem Engage</a> is the latest in Nintendo's ongoing series of deep tactical RPGs, and at the heart of that is a rewarding class system. Each of your recruits will come with their own specialization and class, but you can change the classes as you wish throughout the game, and upgrade them. To do this, you'll need special items, as well as leveling requirements. Here's how upgrading and optimizing your classes work in Fire Emblem Engage.</p><p dir="ltr">As you progress through Fire Emblem Engage, you'll find two types of items required to manage your classes. Those are Master Seals and Second Seals. These have very different uses, but they're both important to managing your units' classes. All classes fall into either Base or Advanced classes. Advanced classes are branches from the Base classes.</p><p dir="ltr">Every unit comes with a class by default, and some are unique classes like Divine Child (the protagonist Alear) or Lord (the prince Diamont). Once you've reached level 10 with a class, you can use a Master Seal to upgrade it to an Advanced class. Usually you'll be able to choose from two or more Advanced classes that branch from the Base class. The Advanced classes generally have more specialized skills than their Base version, and for the most part, you'll want to keep a class within its existing core competency.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fire-emblem-engage-changing-classes-master-seals-and-second-seals-explained/1100-6510731/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Fire Emblem Engage is a new entry in the beloved tactical RPG franchise, with a twist that pays homage to the series' long history and array of iconic characters. Throughout the story you'll collect 12 "Emblem" rings, each of which houses the essence of a hero from other Fire Emblem games. These grant you battlefield bonuses and special attacks, but to get the absolute most out of your Emblem rings, you'll need to max out your Bonds with them.</p><p dir="ltr">For the most part, leveling up your Bond with your Emblem rings is fairly straightforward. You can equip an Emblem ring and reap the benefits in battle, and level it up just like you would gain regular experience. Occasionally you'll need to take part in brief Bond conversation cutscenes--similar to your party members' Support conversations--both of which can be found in the Reference menu. Leveling up your Bonds with your Emblems will unlock new Skills that can be equipped on your character even when equipped with a different Emblem ring.</p><h3 dir="ltr">How To Level Up Bonds Fast</h3><p dir="ltr">With dozens of characters and 12 Emblem rings, each of which has several of its own skills to learn, there are countless possible combinations that you can use to come up with killer character builds. You may find yourself needing to level up your Bonds quickly to unlock that last piece you need, and fortunately, there's a way.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fire-emblem-engage-max-bond-level-how-to-level-up-bonds-fast/1100-6510729/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Fire Emblem: Three Houses had a very detailed social interaction system that took place over many years and ultimately let you marry one of several romantic partners, including those outside of your own House if you played your cards right. The system in Engage is not nearly as robust, so for fans of Three Houses, this will feel much smaller.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fire-emblem-engage-romance-options-can-you-romance-characters/1100-6510728/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Over a decade separates the releases between the first film and Avatar: The Way of Water. But director James Cameron wasn't just dilly dallying away behind the scenes. In fact, he recently explained the "hideously difficult" process of filming human actors--like Jack Champion's Spider--alongside Na'vi in the sequel with cinematographer Russell Carpenter.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2023/01/awards-insider-shot-list-avatar-the-way-of-water">Vanity Fair</a>, the duo explained the lighting process behind Avatar 2 and how certain scenes were shot two times years apart with Spider. "Because he was in so many scenes, in so many different environments, you really have to nail down exactly when and where and how the light is and maybe where shafts of sunlight are hitting," Carpenter said. "If any of those cues are off, the audience goes, 'Wait, something's out of whack.' And so we worked really, really hard."</p><p dir="ltr">Cameron followed this up elaborating about how Champion did motion capture for Spider first before filming scenes as himself. "So Russ would light the scene, so everything that we did with Jack photographically, we did previously with him in terms of capture," Cameron said. "So, Jack did his entire performance twice, once for all the other actors like Sigourney [Weaver, who portrays Kiri] and Britain [Dalton, who portrays Lo'ak] and Sam [Worthington, who portrays Jake Sully], so that he was there kind of off camera. And he was like 13 at the time.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avatar-the-way-of-waters-spider-scenes-were-shot-twice-two-years-apart/1100-6510727/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>With just a few months to go before the release of one of the biggest games of 2023, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Nintendo has begun to increase Switch production. The last couple of years have been tough on Switch sales due to high demand and a semiconductor shortage in the global market, and according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-20/nintendo-switch-production-boost-set-to-defy-industry-forecasts">Bloomberg</a> report (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-is-ramping-up-switch-production-ahead-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">IGN</a>), Nintendo has told suppliers that it plans to increase production for the financial year ending in 2024.</p><p>Nintendo has managed to weather the supply shortage storm, although the company did revise its sales forecast in November 2022. Tears of the Kingdom is expected to not only be a top seller for Nintendo when it releases in May but also a shot in the arm for system sales that have been impacted by supply constraints.

If those don’t work, though, we’ve spelled out the full answer further down in the guide if players simply want to head into the weekend with their streak still intact.</p><h2>Today's Wordle Answer - January 20, 2023</h2><p>We'll begin with two hints that directly relate to the Wordle answer, but won't immediately give the word away.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/todays-wordle-answer-580-january-20-2023/1100-6510691/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
