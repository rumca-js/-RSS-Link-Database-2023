This time, it's over his preference not to shame white children for the color of their skin. Such an evil, evil man. </p><p>Earlier today, Press Secretary <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/doocy-biden-classified-docs\" target=\"_blank\">Karine Jean-Pierre</a> was asked about DeSantis' education department <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joy-reid-ron-desantis\" target=\"_blank\">banning</a> an Advanced Placement course on African American Studies. Even though this was a very straightforward question, she bizarrely brought in LGBTQAAEIP+2S talking points. Deflection must just be her natural instinct. </p><p>Jean-Pierre claimed that Florida's actions aren't surprising, since Florida teachers aren't allowed to talk \"about who they are and who they love.\" </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201c#BREAKING: Karine Jean-Pierre responds to Gov. Ron DeSantis's (R-FL) education department banning AP African American Studies: \"These types of actions aren't new... Florida currently bans teachers from talking about who they are and who they love.\"\\u201d</div> \u2014 Forbes (@Forbes)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Forbes/status/1616517342363586589\">1674242742</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Actually, Florida bans teachers from randomly talking to preschoolers about who they like to bang and why. Which I personally find quite reasonable. </p><p>Plus, the African American Studies course in question was not banned because DeSantis is a meanie racist poopy head. It's because it includes Critical Race Theory and intersectionality, which basically teach children that race is the most important thing in life and white people are racist and evil. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.theflstandard.com/exclusive-rejected-african-american-studies-course-in-florida-features-crt-intersectionality-and-queer-theory/\" target=\"_blank\">The Florida Standard</a> obtained a leaked copy of the curriculum ahead of its release. It features texts from Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, author of the book \"Racism without Racists,\" which describes how \"whites talk, think, and account for the existence of racial inequality and makes clear that color-blind racism is as insidious now as ever.\" </p><p>The curriculum also includes a section called \u201cBlack Queer Studies,\" described as \"explor[ing] the concept of queer color critique, grounded in Black feminism and intersectionality, as a Black studies lens that shifts sexuality studies towards racial analysis.\u201d</p><p>I do wonder how a course like this could possibly be determined to be an \"Advanced Placement\" course. Normal AP courses are just...advanced versions of regular courses. Like Biology vs. AP Biology. Is there a less advanced class on how to hate the whites? I need answers. </p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!

Custom officers have reportedly seen a huge rise in cases of smugglers failing to declare their eggs, only to discover mountainous quantities of eggs upon further inspection. </p><p>Failure to declare one's eggs could result in a penalty of up to $10,000 for repeat egg criminals. On the other hand, if you fess up to your crimes and throw yourself at the mercy of U.S. Customs and Border Patrol by declaring your eggs,  you won't face any penalty. But your eggs will tragically end up in the incinerator. </p><p>So smugglers, please remember to always declare your eggs when entering the country.

Are you being serious right now? https://t.co/jvCmdJ28XJ\\u201d</div> \u2014 Daily Caller (@Daily Caller)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DailyCaller/status/1616319616568934400\">1674195601</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Reid's basis for suggesting Governor DeSantis is a murderous Fascist sympathizer is...his opposition to teaching white kids to hate themselves. Specifically, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/desantis-rejects-textbooks-pushing-crt\" target=\"_blank\">Critical Race Theory.</a> </p><p>Florida recently rejected an Advanced Placement African-American studies course because it allegedly contains CRT. Reid was unhappy with this move since it means that Florida schools will continue to teach European history and fail to sufficiently shame white students. </p><p>Last year, DeSantis signed the \"Stop Woke Act,\" which prohibits teachings about race that make students feel \u201cguilt, anguish or other psychological distress.\" Portions of the act have since been blocked in court over free-speech allegations. The act seems pretty fair to me, but maybe that's just my racist whiteness speaking. I am a fan of little to no anguish and psychological distress for white kindergarteners. Call me crazy. </p><p>Reid also went after DeSantis for <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nhl-job-fair-florida\" target=\"_blank\">criticizing the National Hockey League's</a> recent 'diversity' efforts, after the NHL posted on LinkedIn information about an event for women, veterans, Black people, Asians, Pacific Islanders, Hispanics, Latinos, Indigenous, LGBTQ, or disabled people. </p><p><span></span>DeSantis' spokesman said of the event, \"Discrimination of any sort is not welcome in the state of Florida.\" Which is exactly what a fascist overlord would say. Everyone knows anti-discrimination was the name of the game in Nazi Germany. <br /></p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cNEW - @GovRonDeSantis spox issues statement condemning NHL for hosting summit where participants must .. \\u201cidentify as female, Black, Asian/Pacific Islander, Hispanic/Latino ..\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cDiscrimination of any sort is not welcome in the state of Florida,\\u201d says spox @BryanDGriffin \\n\\n\\ud83d\\udc47\\ud83c\\udffd\\u201d</div> \u2014 MAHSA SAEIDI, ESQ.\\ud83d\\udd75\\ud83c\\udffc \\u200e\\u0645\\u0647\\u0633\\u0627 (@MAHSA SAEIDI, ESQ.\\ud83d\\udd75\\ud83c\\udffc \\u200e\\u0645\\u0647\\u0633\\u0627)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MahsaWho/status/1614054703263784961\">1673655603</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Reid then closed her argument with a cute little quote from DeSantis' 2018 opponent, \u201cI\u2019m not saying Ron DeSantis is racist, but to quote Andrew Gillum, \u2018I think the racists might think he\u2019s racist.'\" You go, queen. I think she just ended fascism with that sass. </p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!

Now Zirin is cranky that the NFL and NBC \"coddle\" Dungy's \"right-wing extremism.\" The extremism being that he believes in Jesus and believes in alternatives to all abortion, all the time, always.</p><p>Dungy doesn't talk about this while he is covering the NFL on NBC Sports. Unlike <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nhl-pride-jersey-ivan-provorov\" target=\"_blank\">way too many</a> analysts <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nhl-network-analyst-lashes-out\" target=\"_blank\">for the NHL</a>, Dungy believes when people tune in to the NFL on NBC, they want to see NBC talk about the NFL. But Dungy is allowed to be on television while holding political opinions Zirin doesn't approve of. It gives David a sad.</p><p>Zirin's rant had the usual buzzwords: \"disinformation,\" the anon between P and R, \"DeSantis,\" etc. The bulk of his outburst went to the two Dungy partners.</p><blockquote>[The NFL and NBC's] silence speaks volumes. It\u2019s a silence that\u2019s almost as loud as Dungy\u2019s hateful blather, almost as loud as the thousands of people descending upon Washington\u2014some mandatorily\u2014to celebrate a fascistic...</blockquote><p>Saying that states can decide regulations on aborting choices =/= fascism.</p><blockquote>...discredited Supreme Court...<span></span></blockquote><p>It's problematic the way Zirin is attempting to discredit a government institution like this. He sounds like an insurrectionist.</p><blockquote>...and the loss of our rights.</blockquote><p>Zirin is a man who lives in Washington DC, where you can have an abortion up until right before the baby pops out. Nothing the Supreme Court did caused a loss to his rights or anyone else's rights. But if not for spreading disinformation, leftists would have nothing to talk about when it came to abortion or the Supreme Court.</p><p>Dungy is taking part in a peaceful march that happens every year. Then he is going to talk about football and tell everyone why the Buffalo Bills are winning the Super Bowl this year. Zirin can go cry in the corner about it.</p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!
