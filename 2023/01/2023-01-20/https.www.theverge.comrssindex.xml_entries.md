  <p id="5ozOMd">TikTok has confirmed to <em>Forbes</em> that some of its US employees have the ability to boost videos in order to “introduce celebrities and emerging creators to the TikTok community.” The statement comes as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilybaker-white/2023/01/20/tiktoks-secret-heating-button-can-make-anyone-go-viral/?sh=49d5fa176bfd">part of a report</a> about TikTok’s “Heating” button, which <em>Forbes</em> says can be used to put selected videos onto users’ For You pages, helping boost views by sidestepping the algorithm that supposedly drives the TikTok experience.</p>
<p id="WKkj9X">Jamie Favazza, a spokesperson for TikTok, told <em>Forbes</em> that increasing views to particular videos isn’t the only reason for heating. TikTok will also “promote some videos to help diversify the content experience” (read: make sure your feed isn’t entirely made up of one or two trends), he said. Favazza also suggests...</p>

## Instagram showed people too many videos last year, admits Adam Mosseri

  <p id="TXUFVE">Even Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, now believes that the platform put a lopsided emphasis on videos and Reels last year — and traditional photo posts were worse off because of it. In one of the answers from his weekly Q&amp;A with users today, he acknowledged, “I think we were overfocused on video in 2022 and pushed ranking too far and basically showed too many videos and not enough photos.” Mosseri said that Instagram has since worked behind the scenes to restore a more even balance, and internal metrics show that it’s working.</p>
<p id="Res2SZ">“Things like how often someone likes photos versus videos and how often someone comments on photos versus videos are roughly equal, which is a good sign that things are balanced,” he said. “To the degree that...</p>

  <p id="o3vaUE">Part of what makes Junji Ito’s work so terrifying is how it sticks with you. The mind behind iconic horror manga like <em>Tomie</em> and <em>Uzumaki</em> takes an idea — whether it’s a schoolgirl who can’t die or a small town obsessed with spirals — and steadily pushes the concept as far it can go, usually toward some kind of disturbing body horror that forces you to look away. Before you know it, the idea has lodged itself in your brain, his carefully crafted black-and-white images flashing even after you close the book.</p>

  <p id="KQGCOD">It’s Friday, which means it’s time for some Frideals (sorry, not sorry). First off, the last-gen <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"><strong>Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro</strong></a> have fallen to their lowest price yet.

And as good a replacement as the newer Buds Pro are, they launched at a higher price of $229.99, making this discount on the last-gen model all the more worthwhile for anyone that wants some good buds on a budget. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Read our review</a>.</p>

  <p id="Z0TQLf">If you have a guest over to your house for any amount of time, there’s a fair chance they’ll ask you for the Wi-Fi password, which may begin a dreaded dance of you trying to remember what it is or read out a complicated string of numbers, letters, and symbols. </p>
<p id="YKKjzZ">Of course, you could always buy a Wi-Fi password sign or write it on a sticky note that you can quickly point guests to, but that’s not always the most convenient solution; if your password is long or contains hard-to-read symbols (is that an O or a 0?), it can be a pain to get your friends and family connected.</p>
<p id="IsHMh0">It’s worth noting that if you frequently have people you don’t know very well or large groups over, you should really look into setting up a guest or temporary Wi-Fi...</p>

  <p id="W740pP">At nearly three pounds, or 1,340g, the $5,500 Nikon Z9 is a brick of a mirrorless camera with more buttons and features than I have been able to test in the nearly two months I have had with it. It has a new full-frame 45.7MP stacked CMOS sensor that, thanks to the new Expeed 7 image processor, can shoot RAW photos at 20fps for over 1,000 frames (assuming you are using a fast enough card). And the video specs put flagship specs from Sony’s A1 and Canon’s R5 to shame. They include 12-bit 8K 60fps or 4K 120fps both in N-RAW, Nikon’s RAW video format. You can also shoot in ProRes RAW up to 5K 30fps. </p>

<p id="aOUFOU">As recently as December, we’d heard Google execs were worried that despite investing heavily in AI technology, moving too fast to roll it out <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/14/23508756/google-vs-chatgpt-ai-replace-search-reputational-risk">could harm the company’s reputation</a>.

  <p id="1X6feQ">Winnebago’s name is synonymous with vanlife, which makes its new <a href="https://www.winnebago.com/all-electric">all-electric eRV2</a> notable for an industry built on top of diesel engines. It’s just a prototype, but this one is fully operational and actually on the road with a fleet of customers for six months of field testing. Input from those early experiences will ultimately inform the eRV’s final design and help kick off an era of #eVanlife in the process.</p>
<p id="NH7EZ2">The eRV2 is a follow-up to the eRV concept announced last year. It’s built around the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21559954/ford-e-transit-electric-delivery-cargo-van-price-specs-range">Ford E-Transit chassis</a> with a range of 108 miles (174km) from its 68kWh battery. Yes, that’s paltry for a vehicle that will be used by adventure seekers far away from EV charging networks but fine for field testing a prototype, I guess. Winnebago...</p>
