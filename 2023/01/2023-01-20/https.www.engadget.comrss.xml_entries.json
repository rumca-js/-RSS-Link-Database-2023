In addition, the company is said to be adjusting the risk levels it's prepared to take on as it rolls out such tech. Priorities for a demo of the search chatbot seemingly include safety, accuracy and blocking out misinformation. However, for the other products and tools Google is working on, it has \"a lower bar and will try to curb issues relating to hate and toxicity, danger and misinformation rather than preventing them,\" the <em>Times </em>reported.</p><p>Of late, Google has exercised some caution when it comes to unveiling new products. The slide deck reportedly mentioned \"<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/getty-images-ai-generated-content-ban-153337930.html\"><ins>copyright</ins></a>, privacy and antitrust\" as the main risks of AI tech. It's said to have noted that solutions were needed to keep out copyrighted material and prevent personally identifiable information from being shared.</p><p>Over the last few years, there has been <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/whats-going-on-at-google-ai-150001422.html\"><ins>a backlash</ins></a> against Google's handling of AI ethics. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-national-labor-relations-board-complaint-employees-182352103.html\"><ins>Timnit Gebru</ins></a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/margaret-mitchell-google-ai-233309349.html\"><ins>Margaret Mitchell</ins></a>, two leading AI ethics researchers, said Google fired them. Gebru and Mitchell accused Google of censoring research that criticizes AI language-learning models, including concerns that they encode biases found in training data. That can result \"in models that encode stereotypical and derogatory associations along gender, race, ethnicity, and disability status,\" the researchers wrote <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3442188.3445922\"><ins>in a paper</ins></a>.

The EV would reportedly make even the hybrid <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ford-maverick-2022-pickup-review-3d-printing-video-133014666.html\">Ford Maverick</a> seem enormous with two doors, a low-slung profile and a bed 4ft to 4.5ft long. It would start below $30,000, making it a bargain compared to the $39,900 Silverado.</p><p>The design isn't guaranteed to enter production, and it's not even clear which GM brand would carry the pickup if it moves forward. Affordable EV design director Michael Pevovar told <em>Automotive News</em> the company creates prototypes like these to &quot;get a reaction&quot; and either improve the result or scrap it. If the prototype is too small but otherwise well-received, GM could use another platform to make it larger.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>There are incentives for GM to go ahead. The small pickup market is relatively hot at the moment. <em>Autoblog</em> points out that the was Maverick outselling the larger Ranger and the Expedition SUV as of last summer, while Hyundai's Santa Cruz (more of an El Camino revival than a classic truck) outperformed the Accent compact and Venue mini-SUV. GM would not only have something to offer in the category, but could stand out as the only brand with an all-electric model.</p><p>As it is, there's a rush to produce more affordable EVs. Chevy's own <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/chevy-blazer-equinox-ev-teaser-184112130.html\">Equinox EV</a> is expected to start around  $30,000, while <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tesla-battery-day-25k-ev-231307638.html\">Tesla</a> and other brands are also pursuing lower-priced vehicles in the years ahead.

Keychron\u2019s Q1 Pro, then, will be of great interest to those who want to fully configure their own keyboard but also want the convenience of Bluetooth.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>As the name suggests, the Q1 Pro is heavily based on <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/keychron-q-1-fully-customizable-keyboard-130015959.html\"><ins>the original Q1</ins></a> model which Keychron launched in late 2021. Like its predecessor, the Pro model features a gasket design (a double gasket in fact), hot-swappable switches and QMK/VIA compatibility (open source software for easy remapping of any key). There\u2019s also the option of an aluminum rotary knob for things like volume control (or zoom, or brightness or whatever else you might want it for) and the obligatory RGB. As with all Keychron models, it\u2019s also compatible with Mac, Windows and Android - or all three at the same time thanks to the option to connect to multiple Bluetooth devices.</p><p>We were big fans of the original Q1 which offered a relatively affordable entry point into the fully customizable keyboard world. And it\u2019s a bit of a weird world at that, with configurations, price and availability varying wildly. Perhaps two of the higher profile competitors for the Q1 are the <a href=\"https://www.gloriousgaming.com/products/glorious-gmmk-pro-75-barebone-black\"><ins>GMMK Pro</ins></a> (starting at $170 barebones, or $350 pre-built) and the recently released Sense75 from Drop (starting at $249 barebones, or $350 pre-built).</p><figure><img alt=\"The rearside of the Q1 Pro mechanical keyboard is shown along with the switch to turn on Bluetooth\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/b4770610-98c2-11ed-bfbb-44b20b1ccc65\" style=\"height: 1226; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>In a slight break from tradition, the Q1 Pro is being launched <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/keytron/keychron-q1-pro-qmk-via-wireless-custom-mechanical-keyboard\"><ins>via Kickstarter</ins></a>. The benefit here being the chance to grab one at an early bird price. The barebones model is available for $174 if you already have your own switches and keycaps. Or, for $194 you can get the pre-assembled kit. Given that a set of keycaps or switches often cost more than $20 on their own, the complete kit does represent a pretty decent value.</p><p>Once you have everything setup, or out of the box if you go fully-assembled, Bluetooth pairing is merely a key-combo away. As noted earlier, you can connect the Q1 Pro to up to three devices of any type thanks to the switch around the back for Windows/Android and MacOS. There are even spare key caps in the box for the differing keys on Microsoft vs Apple layouts. Of course, if you want to connect over USB-C instead, that\u2019s still an option.</p><p>Battery life will largely depend on how ham you go with the RGB. With no backlighting at all, Keychron claims you can expect about 300 hours of use on a full charge. If you\u2019re demure with it, that number drops to 90. Keychron doesn\u2019t give an estimate for hardcore full-power RGB but expect it to be less.</p><p>With the model Keychron sent for testing, the gasket design appears to have a bit more flex in it than the original Q1, but that doesn\u2019t translate to a softer typing experience thankfully. The supplied red switches are comparable to Cherry reds in resistance, but of course you can choose whatever you want, in fact it\u2019s encouraged. It\u2019s hard to make a like-for-like comparison without having a rival product with the same switches and keycaps, but, overall, the Drop Sense75 and GMMK Pro feel a little stiffer on the gasket side of things resulting in a snappier type. As always, your mileage and preferences will vary.</p><p>Regardless, if you wanted a premium aluminum, customizable keyboard with Bluetooth connectivity, the Keychron Q1 Pro is likely your best (if not only) choice right now.</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/swytch-air-kit-hands-on-2023-140001457.html?src=rss", "title": "Swytch Air expands your world for less than the cost of an e-bike", "date_published": "2023-01-20 14:00:01+00:00", "description": "<p>I\u2019ve worked from home for twelve-plus years now, and between that, kids and COVID lockdowns I hadn\u2019t realized just how much my world had shrunk.

But it was only when I started listing where I go, that I realized how small my world has become. These days, I\u2019m limited to my office, the backyard, my kids\u2019 school and the nearest, admittedly lackluster strip mall. I think I blinded myself to how small my horizons had become until I was given an excuse to probe beyond.</p><p>This, I should explain, came in the context of my 38th birthday, after deciding that I would try a ground-up rebuild of my bike. A 2005 Falcon Nomad, which had been sitting in a succession of sheds for the last 15-or-so years. I figured I\u2019d ask for the tools, and a book explaining what to do, and then teach myself to strip and reassemble a bicycle as I went. This, friends, did not go very well, since the bike\u2019s advanced age and poor state meant every repair I attempted, from paint job to brake replacement, went horribly wrong.

That said, a Swytch kit and an analog bicycle is often far cheaper than all but the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-lectric-xp-lite-is-a-folding-e-bike-with-a-really-low-price-122558687.html\">most basic</a> (and ugly) of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/vanmoof-e-bike-s5-a5-halo-ring-phone-mount-find-my-150025177.html\">new e-bikes</a>.</p><p>(There\u2019s also the longstanding point that millions of people have bikes in similar states of disrepair in their own sheds or garages. But a lack of confidence, or fitness, means that they won\u2019t get them out and reacquaint themselves with cycling. If you could easily and cheaply add an electric motor to one, however, then most of those objections fade away pretty quickly.)</p><p>Buying a Swytch kit is more complex than just heading down to a store and snatching one up \u2013 you\u2019ll need to let Swytch know the size of your existing bike and wheels. You\u2019ll need to send them detailed measurements of your front forks, and the size of the gap into which a wheel can be inserted. Then, after some delay, it\u2019ll send you a custom-sized wheel built to fit into the space, with all of the necessaries to get you up and running.</p><figure><img alt=\"Close up of the Swytch Kit Air (2022) Battery and handlebar mount\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/4f5c4610-9718-11ed-bbf5-6d3e133a2296\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>The ads say that if you\u2019re capable of changing a tyre, then you\u2019re capable of installing Swytch, which is accurate. Even I, who couldn\u2019t get my rear brakes to sit properly, was able to screw in the wheel and wire up the cable. Once you\u2019ve done, it\u2019s mostly self-explanatory, although I would have liked some more guidance as to best placement for the pedal sensor. You basically just use a hex key to bolt on the little OLED display, battery controller / mount and wire up the (color-coded) cables, using the cable ties supplied to keep everything tidy.</p><p>One tip \u2013 when you\u2019re attaching the wheel of magnets to the crank arm and the Hall Effect sensor, leave your cable ties loose until everything\u2019s lined up. That way, you can make finer adjustments, useful since every Swytch customer is entitled to a quick video call with a tech support person. They\u2019ll survey your setup, and make sure that your installation has been successful, and offer any hints to improve your performance. (To be honest, I still don't think I've necessarily got mine in the best place, but imagine that my ability is very much the deepest floor and that most people will do much better.)&nbsp;</p><p>Previous Swytch models required battery packs that were closer to purse sizes than anything more elegant. The new innovation with this generation of kit is the greatly reduced size, with the Air battery pack now small enough to fit into your pocket. Swytch Air\u2019s 36V battery pack will run you around 10 miles of assist on Level 2 power, and is a little bigger than a beefy mobile power brick. The company has made a deal about the fact that Air is more or less \u201cpocketable,\u201d although you wouldn\u2019t want to keep it in your back pocket for any serious period of time.</p><figure><img alt=\"Image of the Swytch Air OLED display.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/6e814bd0-9718-11ed-b3eb-78753d39aea2\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>More crucially, at 700 grams, or around 1.5 pounds, it\u2019s light enough to toss into your bag when you\u2019re parked up. Oh, for completeness\u2019 sake, there is a larger version of the Swytch battery, Max, which has a quoted range of around just under 20 miles and is a little under twice the size and weight. Although both of these are on the conservative side, mostly because the kit won\u2019t kick in if you\u2019re cycling in flat, easy conditions. So you can actually expect that distance to run for quite a bit longer, good for days where you\u2019ll be covering plenty of ground.</p><p>I had a fairly busy day last week, with a trip to two different medical centers on opposite ends of the city and the bank in between. The whole journey would have taken me about 20 minutes for each leg of the trip by car, or several hours if I\u2019d taken the bus. But while I\u2019ve not cycled 10 miles in a single go, on mostly major roads, for\u2026 decades at this point, I felt that the Swytch could help. After all, if the terrain was rough, I could kick in the assistance to help me, and I wasn\u2019t worried about running out of energy for the same reason.</p><figure><img alt=\"Image of the Hall effect sensor and magnet wheel attached to my crank arm, which I'm 99 percent sure is installed wrong.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/8cc62ac0-9718-11ed-91eb-308d901f50e6\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>The other thing a Swytch kit does is offer you the power that gives you the confidence to do the hard stuff. Like powering up a hill, or sitting between cars at the lights, knowing that you\u2019ve got the electric power to not get chewed up when we have to start. Knowing that I can pretty easily kick up the assistance level and get my speed up to 12-or-so miles an hour before the driver beside me can put their foot down makes for a sturdier ride.</p><p>Now, there\u2019s nothing that Swytch is doing that more technical-minded riders couldn\u2019t do on their own. I\u2019ve seen forum talk about saving money by opting for a third-party wheel kit and some hefty DIY, but I don\u2019t think this applies here. Swytch isn\u2019t charging mad money for the setup, and offers a cohesive, sealed package that offers you peace of mind and proper technical support.</p><p>There are downsides\u2026 obviously there are downsides. Bolting on the machinery for an e-bike onto one that wasn\u2019t built for it is a little inelegant. It required a lot of fiddling, and I\u2019m still not sure that I\u2019ve got it set up as perfectly as I could do, but it\u2019s certainly achievable. Taking up so much space on your front handlebars, too, means that you\u2019re losing a lot of real estate to the battery mount and controller. If you\u2019ve got bike lights that sit close to the bar, you might need to relocate them to the head tube, and then find it\u2019s not as useful a place to stick them.</p><figure><img alt=\"My bike, with the Swytch Kit (2022) installed.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/270c0870-9719-11ed-aec7-d4b4f64e9ac7\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>As for pricing and availability, that\u2019s a little complex: Swytch will charge you up to \u00a3999 (around $1,010 excluding the UK\u2019s sales tax) for a kit if you want one as quickly as it can ship one to you. But it\u2019ll also offer \u2013 at the very minimum \u2013 a 50 percent discount if you choose to wait for a later shipment from the factory, with that figure rising up to 60 percent depending on your patience. If you\u2019re prepared to delay your gratification for long enough, you could snag one of these things for \u00a3450 (around $550 before tax), which as far as I\u2019m concerned, is the price this thing becomes a no-brainer.</p><p>I\u2019m sufficiently impressed by the Swytch kit to want to buy the unit currently bolted to my bike. The ability to quickly and easily add so much power, with all of the privileges that conveys, is pretty darn special. I can heartily recommend it to people with bikes rusting in their sheds, who want to get back on the road but are worried their fitness level won\u2019t permit them to travel very far. Take it from me \u2013 it\u2019s worth it.</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/engadget-podcast-apple-m2-macbook-pro-mac-mini-133012497.html?src=rss", "title": "Engadget Podcast: Apple\u2019s new M2 MacBook Pros and Mac Mini", "date_published": "2023-01-20 13:30:12+00:00", "description": "<p>Apple\u2019s first major announcements of 2023 are here!

These new SuperPODs have limited availability, too. At launch, new servers with 4080 GPUs will be in four places: San Jose, Los Angeles, Dallas and Frankfurt, Germany.

If the ITC (International Trade Commission) finds in the company\u2019s favor, it would, in the words of Louis Rossmann (who published the text of the complaint), \u201cfire a kill shot on the entire repair industry.\u201d Samsung says several patents cover its AMOLED displays. But factories in China (and elsewhere) are, according to the company, churning out similar screens that infringe on those patents.
