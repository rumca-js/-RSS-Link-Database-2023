When 12-year-old Giovanna, from an affluent neighbourhood in Naples, overhears her father compare her to his hated sister, Vittoria, about whom he once said \u201cugliness and spite were combined to perfection\u201d, her world is turned upside down. She had always sought the approval of her father, a leftwing intellectual and teacher who, in turn, took pride in his daughter\u2019s studiousness. But in the early years of adolescence, Giovanna has become unsure of his love and of herself, and has let her grades slip. She knows little about her aunt, whose name was akin to \u201ca monstrous being who taints and infects anyone who touches her\u201d. And so, after leafing through old family photos in which Vittoria\u2019s face is scratched out, she resolves to find her and discover the truth of her estrangement from her father.</p><p>Ferrante\u2019s 2019 novel, an adaptation of which came to Netflix this month, spans three years in the life of Giovanna, and explores themes of class, faith, family and the lies people tell each other. The actor Marisa Tomei is the narrator, capturing the hurt and doggedness of the young protagonist, and the transgressive rebellion of the chain-smoking Vittoria. Giovanna\u2019s path to understanding the adult world is often painful though, as the years pass, she attains a new wisdom, gaining power over adults and their deceit by telling lies of her own. <br /><br />\u2022 Available on Random House Audio, 10hr 21min</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/20/the-lying-life-of-adults-by-elena-ferrante-audiobook-review-faith-and-deceit\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jan/20/from-french-romcoms-to-japanese-horror-your-picks-of-the-best-non-english-flicks", "title": "The Guide #70: Reader picks of the best non-English films", "date_published": "2023-01-20 11:45:22+00:00", "description": "<p>In this week\u2019s newsletter: As Netflix\u2019s All Quiet on the Western Front proves to be a surprise awards season hit, what better time to ask for your favourite films in other languages?</p><ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://ablink.email.theguardian.com/ss/c/TBl-lE0k4WbTlFRn6v-lQXxTpTslqnvUsR2ofAkC00vqkHXqakTSxrykj9mrdACFM7X02zB_4eaUcPGwGF8aSd8qfug3UI-6On7SZ6NCb1bc8x_o5dndnbkzvJa5hUkQ9nhvD7IJSuyXeKbacJDYEqlFbAZ0vOIKsv3NFHydfPIzaUpYyjP0KfOAhLRYMW2yTAs6TBIgM3bi7aVl__6M8OuHfLZfd7xmigDS_KOnKuU_bc0LD-KQTnN7wlkHVqzvlJ18crhTOgngZzAlM4_3_SCUmWonlgL50tNfCaUIQQk/3hx/2l-ct5r6Q8CNEhlq1hSBIw/h15/kSGp0pNCsCxOwXsdDM-fI8ISkKBb6hYjBXPF16gxdC8\">Don\u2019t get the Guide delivered to your inbox?
