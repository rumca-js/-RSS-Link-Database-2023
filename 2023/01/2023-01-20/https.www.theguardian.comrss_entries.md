<p>Ugly fallout between the fanbase and the board places Frank Lampard’s struggling side in a dangerously precarious position</p><p>It is too charitable to describe Everton as a club in crisis. A crisis can be solved with the right people in charge. Everton are engulfed in a civil war, the consequences could be catastrophic, and it is a measure of the turmoil that the potential endgame for a manager with the worst win ratio bar the hapless Mike Walker is not dominating their agenda before the trip to West Ham.</p><p>Frank Lampard returns to his first club on Saturday having presided over 10 defeats in 13 matches and Everton’s descent to joint bottom of the Premier League. Awaiting him is David Moyes, who also hasn’t won a league game since late October, who has also collected 15 points and whose job is also on the line before a fortnight’s break in the league. It is not fantasy to suggest the Scot could resurface back at Goodison Park should West Ham part company.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/20/everton-engulfed-in-civil-war-that-could-have-catastrophic-end">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Both clubs are reborn this season and this storied fixture seems ready to take on a life of its own once more</p><p>Listen carefully and you might just hear the sound of an old rivalry stirring. On Sunday there is unlikely to be pizza in the Emirates Stadium tunnel and, even if a penalty is missed, the chances of a bawling match between taker and miscreant appear remote. But Arsenal and Manchester United meet amid a clear sense things are changing: in recent years any excitement around this fixture has leant squarely on its tradition but, at long last, it takes on a life of its own once again.</p><p>This is not a title showdown: any suggestion the race for top spot might develop into a shootout between these two foes was firmly refuted by midweek comebacks at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/18/crystal-palace-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report">Selhurst Park</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/19/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report">the Etihad</a>.

<p>A growing number of people spend more than 20 hours a week caring for relatives or friends. They deserve more support</p><p>The support for unpaid carers, of whom there are 5 million in England and Wales, is not good enough. The latest census release, showing that about 1.5 million carers spend <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/19/5m-in-england-and-wales-provide-unpaid-care-census-shows">more than 50 hours each week</a> caring for elderly or disabled relatives, is an opportunity to address this. While the total number of unpaid carers has fallen by 600,000 since the last census – the pandemic may have skewed the numbers – the rise in the number of those spending at least 20 hours each week on unpaid care is a stark reminder of the demographic changes under way, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jun/16/spare-a-thought-for-overwhelmed-carers-for-whom-theres-no-end-in-sight">challenges these are creating</a> for millions of families, and the inadequate public-policy response.</p><p>Often, these issues are framed in terms of the pressure they put on the NHS. In particular, the chronic national shortage of social care means that many patients who are fit to be discharged from hospital end up stuck there. Unless the 165,000 vacancies for paid care workers start to be filled, it is hard to see this situation improving. The government and councils have mismanaged the sector disastrously, allowing greedy private care home bosses to extract excess profits. The revelation that the directors of one chain, Runwood Homes, received <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/17/owner-of-uk-care-home-group-paid-himself-21m-despite-safety-concerns">£57m in salaries and dividends</a> over five years despite almost a third of their homes failing the most recent inspections, is an egregious example.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/20/the-guardian-view-on-unpaid-carers-labour-even-if-it-is-for-love">Continue reading...</a>

Artists need to be educated and protected</p><p>Faced with an attempt by a new chatbot to imitate his own lyrics, the musician <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/17/this-song-sucks-nick-cave-responds-to-chatgpt-song-written-in-style-of-nick-cave">Nick Cave delivered</a> a withering verdict: it was “replication as travesty”. He understood that AI was in its infancy, but could only conclude that the true horror might be that “it will forever be in its infancy”. While a robot might one day be able to create a plausible song, <a href="https://www.theredhandfiles.com/chat-gpt-what-do-you-think/">he wrote</a>, it would never grow beyond “a kind of burlesque”, because robots – being composed of data – are unable to suffer, while songs arise out of suffering.</p><p>Fans of Cave and his band the Bad Seeds will agree that his music is inimitable, but that doesn’t mean they would necessarily be able to tell the difference. A few days before his remarks, experts were asked to distinguish <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jan/14/art-experts-try-to-spot-ai-works-dall-e-stable-diffusion">between four genuine artworks </a>and generically paired AI imitations.

<p>Draconian shift will be virtually impossible for referees to enforce and will do little to reduce the number of head injuries</p><p>Never accuse rugby union’s authorities of doing things by half. After the red cards will come the deluge of penalties. From next season, the community game in England will see tacklers penalised for any contact above the waist of a ball-carrier.</p><p>The move – which will apply to National One and below in the men’s game and Championship One and below in the women’s game – has already precipitated howls of protest from across the sport. The reactions of coaches and players past and present, some suffering the neurodegenerative legacy of their years in the game, have run the gamut from the uneasy to the splutteringly apoplectic. It is difficult to see how such a draconian shift in the dynamics of the sport could possibly work without referees developing the sort of myopia normally reserved for crooked feeds at the scrum.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/20/rugbys-authorities-hit-a-new-low-with-unworkable-change-to-tackle-rules">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Sundance film festival:</strong> the Star Wars alum gives an impressive performance as an office worker creeping out of her shell but the film’s initial promise fades</p><p>This year’s Sundance film festival, a welcome return to in-person premieres for films that often desperately need an audible response to kickstart word of mouth, has begun with a bit of a shrug. And it’s a specifically frustrating kind of shrug, the kind that comes from initial “oh maybe” enthusiasm slowly fading into “oh of course” disappointment, something many festival attendees know about all too well.</p><p>In Sometimes I Think About Dying, what might sound like Sundance 101 on paper (the title alone read as worryingly quirky), starts out as something far less twee and far more affecting. Star Wars alum Daisy Ridley plays Fran, a withdrawn, almost entirely mute, office worker whose drab days of overhearing painfully unfunny small talk (from colleagues including The White Lotus’s Brittany O’Grady and Hacks’ Megan Stalter) and eating cottage cheese alone at home for dinner are interspersed with brief thoughts of death. They’re not exactly moments of suicidal ideation but more “what ifs”.

<p>Chelsea’s £89m signing has made rapid progress on the pitch but those who trained with him always saw his raw talent</p><p>The conundrum facing Shakhtar Donetsk’s hierarchy was that Mykhailo Mudryk had, for a player of his age, barely been given any oxygen at the top level. It was the summer of 2021 and his previous two managers, Paulo Fonseca and Luís Castro, had not been convinced enough to give him a run. In the club’s boardroom Mudryk was seen as a player who could win the Ballon d’Or; on the training pitch he was routinely viewed as fast, immensely skilful but raw and unpredictable. His 20th birthday had long since passed but he had only made seven appearances for Shakhtar and a further 21 on loan. He was yet to score a senior goal.</p><p>In Roberto De Zerbi, who asks the bold to be even bolder, Shakhtar found the coach who could harness a talent that needed some love. It took only a few viewings for the Italian to be convinced, and to tell the player he had his trust. De Zerbi had already given Mudryk two starts in the league when, with Shakhtar on the point of losing their Champions League playoff against Monaco, he called him from the bench. Mudryk had eight minutes plus extra time to make a difference: he terrorised the Ligue 1 club from the left flank and it was his direct influence, another sparkling run bringing a cross that clipped Ruben Aguilar before looping in, that propelled his side back to the group stage.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/20/rise-of-mykhaylo-mudryk-no-surprise-to-old-teammates-chelsea">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Dior’s industrious designer finds inspiration in century-old modernist poem, as well as the fashion house’s own history</p><p>Forget it, bags – a book of poetry may be the latest accessory. The literary form is enjoying something of a fashion moment. Christian Dior’s menswear show on Friday was the latest case in point: the collection was partly inspired by TS Eliot’s 1922 poem The Waste Land. Models walked in front of big screens with actors Robert Pattison and Gwendoline Christie reading the poem.</p><p>A five-section poem written after a nervous breakdown and musing on the futility of life after the first world war doesn’t immediately seem like the territory of a fashion show. But Eliot – who worked at a bank when The Waste Land was published – might have appreciated the combination of art and commerce.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jan/20/kim-jones-brings-eliots-the-waste-land-to-diors-2023-24-menswear-catwalk">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ken Bruce’s legendary quiz show has spent 25 years enthralling listeners. Will it survive a move away from the BBC? </p><p>Radio 2 has seen a fair few departures in recent years – and saying farewell to 71-year-old Ken Bruce, who has been the constant face of mid-mornings since 1992, will hit harder than most. Earlier this week the legendary broadcaster confirmed he’d be heading up his mid-morning slot on commercial station Greatest Hits Radio instead, the place other Beeb alumni including Simon Mayo now call home.</p><p>It’s his music quiz, Popmaster, that many listeners were most immediately concerned about. The segment was introduced to Bruce’s programme in 1998 and airs at around 10.30am each week day, resulting in millions of listeners stopping what they’re doing. Popmaster sees two music fans pitted against each other to try and display the most impressive amount of knowledge about songs and artists from across the years – some much more obscure than others.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/20/t-shirts-trivia-and-on-air-proposals-why-everything-stops-for-popmaster">Continue reading...</a>

Truly, we are through the looking glass.</p><p>This week, an independent panel commissioned to adjudicate on charges brought by the Football Association against Yems published its reasoned judgment.

Despite this grotesque cabaret, most attention has focused on the panel’s finding that, while acknowledging it was an “extremely serious case” that “came across to the victims and others as offensive, racist and Islamaphobic”,<strong> </strong>Yems was “not consciously racist”.

<p>A comforting and refreshing, vanilla-infused sweet dish for all pudding lovers </p><p>Rice pudding often gets a bad rap. I blame school dinners, with their slimy, claggy iterations, which were always covered by an unappealing skin. But I was the child at primary school who would skip the mains and head straight for dessert, and if there was rice pudding, even better! At the <em>gurdwara</em>, I’d skip the roti and go straight to a plate of <em>kheer</em> (rice pudding) with a <em>jalebi</em> (syrupy, deep-fried batter); I just love it.

<p>Singer and songwriter whose work with the Byrds, and Crosby, Stills and Nash helped define folk-rock</p><p>David Crosby, who has died aged 81, was a premier-league rock’n’roll star twice. In the mid-1960s he was a founder member of the Byrds, the Los Angeles band often credited with inventing the genre “folk-rock”. This was defined by their shimmering recording of Bob Dylan’s Mr Tambourine Man, its distinctive harmonies and chiming 12-string guitar carrying it to the top of the charts in Britain and the US in 1965.</p><p>Arrogant and argumentative, Crosby was sacked from the Byrds in 1967, but, after producing Joni Mitchell’s debut album, Song to a Seagull, he found an ideal berth with Crosby, Stills and Nash. It was a group of distinct individuals who wrote their own songs, but together they created one of the great harmony-singing blends in pop history. Their debut album, Crosby Stills &amp; Nash (1969), was an immediate smash, and proved hugely influential on a rising generation of west coast artists. Crosby’s long hair, walrus moustache and buckskin jacket made him look like a frontiersman for the Age of Aquarius. Their second album, Déjà Vu (1970), with the addition of Neil Young, and the band becoming Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young (CSNY), felt like the crowning moment of a California golden age. It topped the US chart, reached No 5 in the UK and has sold 14m copies.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/20/david-crosby-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Crosby could be overbearing and convinced of his own brilliance – but despite the ups and downs of his time with the Byrds and CSNY, he was always proven right</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/19/legendary-us-musician-david-crosby-dies-aged-81">Legendary US musician David Crosby dies aged 81</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2023/jan/20/david-crosby-co-founder-of-the-byrds-and-crosby-stills-nash-a-life-in-pictures">David Crosby: a life in pictures</a></li></ul><p>By all accounts, including his own, David Crosby could be a tricky and difficult character. His career was regularly punctuated by angry arguments, bitter fallings-out, sackings, general discord. Joni Mitchell once waspishly suggested he was “a human-hater”. His former bandmate Roger McGuinn described his behaviour while a member of the Byrds as that of a “little Hitler”. Perhaps the best way to describe him was mercurial. He could be utterly charming and mischievously funny – fans gave him the affectionate nickname the Old Grey Cat – and incredibly generous to other musicians: Mitchell, among others, owed him a great deal. He could also be impossible: overbearing, mouthy, convinced of his own brilliance.</p><p>The thing was, he was right: Crosby genuinely was brilliant. He was blessed with a beautiful voice and an uncanny gift for harmony: in the early years, when the nascent Byrds were still blatant Beatles copyists called the Beefeaters, his vocals could make even their weakest material sparkle. He was a fantastic, forward-thinking songwriter. The jazz-influenced Everybody’s Been Burned sounded impressively sophisticated – a cutting-edge example of pop’s increasing maturity – when the Byrds recorded it in 1966. It turned out that Crosby had written it in 1962 while still a struggling folkie. Listening back to the multi-platinum albums of Crosby Stills &amp; Nash (CSN), what’s striking is how original and idiosyncratic his songwriting contributions were.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/20/david-crosby-a-mercurial-musical-genius-who-thrived-through-the-chaos">Continue reading...</a>

They haven’t been raised with material exhibitions of antisemitism, and our discussions about it over the years have seemed more like lessons in history.</p><p>But antisemitism is on the rise again in the United States. Harmful tropes have returned to explicit politics, with help from the last president.

<p>Raise a glass of Scotland’s finest on 25 January. Poetry optional</p><p>One of the best things I did last year was to take myself off on a road trip around Scotland, which I wasn’t intending to be a busman’s holiday but which, for a few days at least, turned into one. While there, I got the chance to visit <a href="https://www.themacallan.com/en/distillery/book-experiences">The Macallan’s unbelievably fancy distillery</a>, so it seemed a shame not to visit some other producers while I was in the country, and I honestly can’t think why I’ve never done it before.</p><p>Seeing and tasting a drink in the place where it’s made is always a thrill, but distilleries, with their shiny, polished copper stills, are particularly dramatic. As with any kind of food and drink tourism, you end up understanding so much more about the product and appreciating the difference between one dram and another. (For the ultimate audiovisual experience, go to <a href="https://www.johnniewalker.com/en-gb/visit-us-princes-street/book-whisky-tasting/#id=johnnie-walker-s-journey-of-flavour">the Johnnie Walker experience</a> on Princes Street in Edinburgh, which will also help you identify the kind of whisky you like – or win you round if you don’t think whisky is for you.)</p><p>For more by Fiona Beckett, go to <a href="https://fionabeckett.substack.com/">fionabeckett.substack.com</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/20/whisky-to-give-yourself-burns-night-treat-fiona-beckett">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In this series, Guardian writers share the best advice they’ve ever received and how it has changed their lives</p><p>In my second year of university in England, I had one of the smallest rooms on campus but a beautiful view of the university town from the window in front of my desk. There, as the November snow fell outside, I spent hours poring over the great Victorian novels – Middlemarch, Bleak House, Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. My professors encouraged close reading of the texts rather than paying attention to the critics’ interpretations.</p><p>For an essay, I focused on three chapters of George Eliot’s Middlemarch which recount the main character Dorothea’s honeymoon journey to Rome. Despite all the good will in the world, Dorothea and her new husband only succeed in hurting each other by failing to see things from any perspective beyond their own. Dorothea married Mr Casaubon admiring his vocation as a scholar and wanting to help him. But Casaubon has insecurities about his scholarship, and only sees her offer of help in terms of how it wounds his pride.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/21/i-was-a-student-far-from-home-when-george-eliot-taught-me-to-consider-the-perspectives-of-others">Continue reading...</a>

<p>One layer is too cold, two’s a bit dull. But a third adds instant lift to an outfit (and no, thermal vests don’t count)</p><p>Are you tri-layering? Trust me, you need to be. This is not just a trend – it is a life hack. Layering in threes is a brilliant formula for winter dressing. Three layers are warmer than two, and more comfortable than one. It is cosy but civilised. It has flair without being frenetic.</p><p>Wearing three layers instead of two elevates an outfit from run of the mill to a “look”. A shirt under a blazer is unremarkable; a shirt and a V-neck knit under a blazer is preppy chic. A long-sleeve T-shirt under an open shacket (shirt jacket, come on) is blah; add a fine-knit polo neck under the T-shirt and shacket, on the other hand, and suddenly you’re dressed for a romcom meet-cute over hot chocolate.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jan/20/layering-doesnt-only-keep-you-warm-done-right-it-can-elevate-your-outfit-into-a-look">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Pity a PM trying to sell a flagship policy he never liked, flanked by ‘idiot’ colleagues who don’t much like him</p><p>More than three years after malign fun-fur mascot Boris Johnson first gibbered out the catchphrase, we finally have incontrovertible evidence of what “levelling up” actually is. For its duration, Johnson’s government had a flagship policy that it couldn’t have defined even if it hadn’t been drunk on the contents of a wheelie suitcase. Levelling up now turns out to be a sort of inter-constituency <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/oct/26/squid-games-creator-rich-netflix-bonus-hwang-dong-hyuk">Squid Game</a>, in which MPs who voted for various stripes of self-harm are now forced into trial-by-combat against each other in the hope of appealing to the caprices of shadowy gamesmaster Michael Gove. Arguably there’s an ironic wit to the format – a sort of handout for the anti-handout party, designed solely to inadequately mitigate the effects of cuts made largely by that same party. The players seem quite upset about it now, but are of course free to terminate the game if the majority votes to do so.</p><p>Or as one Conservative MP who missed out <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/levelling-up-fund-successful-bids-areas-eden-project-q36gh3v9r">fumed yesterday</a>: “I’ve got shops without roofs and whole streets of boarded-up houses and some people are getting cash for adventure golf.” Which is, by coincidence, exactly the picture in the political glossary next to the phrase “sunlit uplands”. Another Tory MP <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/rishi-sunak-accused-pumping-levelling-28994152">described the policy delivery</a> as “a fuck-up of epic proportions”, casting it as the Stalingrad of not securing a planetarium for your northern marginal.</p><p>Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/20/levelling-up-rishi-sunak-prime-minister-policy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Lender is latest casualty in sector as cryptocurrencies contagion spreads after FTX collapse</p><p>The cryptocurrency lender Genesis has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the US, becoming the latest victim of the shakeout in the digital asset market after the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/11/ftx-fraud-value-crypto-sbf">collapse of the crypto exchange FTX</a>.</p><p>Genesis Global Capital, one of three Genesis entities that applied for bankruptcy protection on Thursday, froze customer withdrawals on 16 November, days after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/11/cryptocurrency-exchange-ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-protection-in-us">FTX made its own Chapter 11 filing.</a><br /><br />The lender said it had assets and liabilities in the range of $1bn to $10bn, and estimated it had more than 100,000 creditors in its filing with the US bankruptcy court for the southern district of New York. Genesis Global Holdco, the parent group of Genesis Global Capital, also filed for bankruptcy protection, along with another lending unit, Genesis Asia Pacific.<br /><br />Genesis Global Holdco said options under consideration included a sale and that it had $150m in cash to support the restructuring. Under a Chapter 11 process, a struggling company is sheltered from creditors temporarily while it attempts to restructure its finances.<br /><br />Genesis’s derivatives and spot trading, broker dealer and custody businesses were not part of the bankruptcy process, and would continue their client trading operations, the holding company said.<br /><br />The bankruptcy filing is the latest in a cascade of crypto failures and steep job cuts triggered by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jun/29/crypto-crisis-digital-currencies-boom-collapse-bitcoin-terra">plunging digital asset prices last year</a>.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Last year, Genesis extended $130.6bn in crypto loans and traded $116.5bn in assets, according to its website. Its two biggest borrowers were Three Arrows Capital, a Singapore-based crypto hedge fund, and Alameda Research, a trading company closely affiliated with FTX, a source told Reuters. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jun/29/three-arrows-capital-to-become-latest-casualty-of-crypto-crash">Three Arrows</a>, Alameda and FTX are in bankruptcy proceedings.<br /><br />Three Arrows debt to Genesis was assumed by its parent company, the venture capital firm Digital Currency Group (DCG), which then filed a claim against Three Arrows. DCG’s portfolio companies also include the crypto asset manager Grayscale and news service CoinDesk.<br /><br />Crypto lenders, which acted as de facto banks, boomed during the pandemic. But unlike traditional banks, they are not required to hold capital cushions. This year, a shortfall of collateral forced some lenders – and their customers – to shoulder large losses.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/20/crypto-lender-genesis-files-chapter-11-bankruptcy">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Sadler’s Wells, London<br /></strong>The former Spice Girl joins Jules Cunningham and Harry Alexander in a leftfield trio on a quiet, contemplative mission</p><p>You couldn’t get further from Spice Up Your Life than this. Former Spice Girl Mel C makes her contemporary dance debut in a low-key, slow-burn leftfield trio. It’s the work of choreographer Jules Cunningham, devised with Chisholm (to give Melanie her full name) and dancer Harry Alexander.</p><p>Can Chisholm hold her own against these two very experienced dancers? Yes, she can. Always one of the stronger dancers in the Spice Girls, she trained in ballet in childhood. She has a performer’s instinct: chin lifted, elegant poise, steps cleanly finessed. There’s a strength in her presence. This is not virtuoso dancing, but it’s exacting in its geometric lines and balances. Cunningham has designed the dance to make everyone look good. Just as well since they’re all so exposed. Half the audience is on stage, around three sides of the dancefloor, the rest at the front of the auditorium, a closeup view on the unitard-clad bodies.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jan/20/how-did-we-get-here-review-sadlers-wells-london-mel-c">Continue reading...</a>

So I did, and it has now ruined the likes of <a href="https://www.restaurant-stbarts.co.uk/">St Barts</a> for me for ever. Fiennes plays a chef who offers an intricate, highly personal tasting menu that is tweezered into position by an earnest brigade who would live or, so it seems, die by his word. It is one hour 47 minutes of wincingly observed comedy horror about my life; there’s even an abrasive, immensely killable female restaurant critic picking her way through the jus, sap and petals for errors. She’ll regret this.</p><p>Hours after watching the film, I’m in a spacious, Scandi-esque spot overlooking the <a href="https://www.greatstbarts.com/">church of St Bartholomew the Great</a> on a misshapen chair carved from fallen London plane trees. My bottom is cosseted by a soft, sheepskin throw, while a fiercely focused young chef serves me a snack of Welsh wagyu tartare dotted with lovingly pickled wild garlic buds that he personally picked last year. This is followed by the world’s fanciest mini-Hobnob, made with cobnuts and topped with duck liver, before a perfectly spherical cod fritter takes me on a journey of exquisite joy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/20/restaurant-st-barts-london-ec1-restaurant-review-grace-dent">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Jason Graves explains how the cult horror game’s score began as a modern, Hollywood soundtrack, but ended up drawing on a 20th-century orchestral technique to create something much scarier</p><p>What does “horror” sound like to you? Is it the slow thump of a heartbeat, gradually speeding up as adrenaline and cortisol start to flood the nervous system? Is it the wet thwack of meat on metal as something, somewhere, gets rent asunder? Or is it more understated – a soft whisper in the ear when you weren’t expecting it, half-heard shuffling footsteps, the suggestion of a breeze when the air is supposed to be perfectly still?</p><p>Dead Space, the horror game from EA and Visceral that launched for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC back in 2008, managed to get into your head, and under your skin. Complementing the game’s extra-terrestrial, Cronenberg-esque body horror was the mental deterioration of protagonist Isaac Clarke; an engineer stranded aboard the USG Ishimura. He’s not a warrior. He’s not a soldier. He’s just some guy, on a ship teeming with hostile alien lifeforms, whose poor little brain is starting to unravel. For the entire game, you never leave his heavy, blood-soaked boots.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jan/20/dead-space-composer-shares-its-unsettling-secret-jason-graves">Continue reading...</a>

## Absolute power, misconduct and decline: the classical music pieces that unlock Tár

<p>In his controversial film, Todd Field foregrounds melancholic works by Mahler and Elgar. Are they a requiem for Cate Blanchett’s supremely powerful conductor?</p><p><strong>• This piece contains spoilers for Tár</strong></p><p>Earlier this month, director Todd Field was interviewed for <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m001gtrk">Radio 3’s Private Passions</a> about his new film, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/11/tar-review-cate-blanchett-is-perfect-lead-in-delirious-sensual-drama">Tár</a>. The presenter Michael Berkeley had seen it the night before and commented: “It’s the kind of film you want to see with friends and have a good argument about. Is that perhaps what you wanted?” Field replied with a confident “yes” before bursting into laughter.</p><p>At its root, Tár is a study of power. Field might have conjured up a ruthless politician to make his film about, but he chose to go one step higher – picking a figure of absolutism. It features Cate Blanchett in imperious form playing Lydia Tár, the first female chief conductor of one of the world’s top orchestras, the Berlin Philharmonic. A real-life predecessor of the fictional Tár was Herbert von Karajan, who held the helm at the Berlin Philharmonic from 1956 until his death in 1989. Margaret Thatcher admired him greatly and they became friends, no matter that he was a former Nazi party member. “She envied me,” Karajan once said, “that people always did what I requested.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/20/classical-music-tar-cate-blanchett-todd-field">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Academy rarely rewards crowdpleasing blockbusters. But as prestige dramas bomb at the box office, will it have any other choice?</p><p>Awards season hasn’t always been a happy hunting ground for geeky movies. Every now and then the Academy will pick out a film such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/03/joker-review-joaquin-phoenix-todd-phillips">Joker</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jul/25/actionandadventure1">The Dark Knight</a> or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/06/black-panther-review-marvel-wakanda-chadwick-boseman">Black Panther</a> for recognition but its top prizes are usually reserved for more esoteric fare. Not since Peter Jackson’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/dec/19/lordoftherings">The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King</a> in 2004 has a fantasy film swept the board at the Oscars – and even then, voters were arguably rewarding the trilogy rather than its final instalment.</p><p>This year looks a little different, however. And not least because so many critical darlings have struggled so badly at the box office. Usually, movies that pick up early awards-season buzz begin to motor pretty nicely at the box office too. But in the wake of Covid, and cinemas’ glacial march back to financial stability, a number of films have been forced to slink sheepishly into the VOD shadows with nobody willing to pay to see them on the big screen. The case of Todd Field’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/11/tar-review-cate-blanchett-is-perfect-lead-in-delirious-sensual-drama">Tár</a>, for which Cate Blanchett remains in the running for best actress (but which has so far made just $6.3m at the global box office) <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/16/monstrous-maestro-cate-blanchett-cancel-culture-tar">is an obvious case in point</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/20/mavericks-multiverses-and-martial-arts-can-the-geeksphere-pull-off-an-oscar-triumph">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Saturday’s evenly matched middleweight grudge match can lighten the shadow cast by Conor Benn’s failed drug tests</p><p>British boxing’s first significant fight of the year, between Chris Eubank Jr and Liam Smith in Manchester on Saturday night, is a superior matchup to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/oct/06/benn-v-eubank-chaos-leaves-a-legacy-of-greed-stupidity-and-danger">controversial and postponed bout</a> which cast such deep shadows over a troubled sport last October. Three months ago, Eubank Jr was meant to face Conor Benn in a heavily hyped catchweight promotion built on the enmity between their fathers over 30 years ago.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/18/chris-eubank-jr-boxing-is-a-ruthless-game-conor-benn-liam-smith">Eubank Jr</a> is a middleweight, who has also campaigned relatively successfully at super-middle (168lb), while Benn is a welterweight (147lb). The difference in size meant that the fight should never have been agreed, even at a compromised weight of 157lb, but money always wipes away good sense and intelligent competition in boxing. After the staggering amount of attention generated in the buildup there was, in the end, only disappointment and outrage at the way in which the promoters had tried to press ahead with the fight despite the fact that Benn <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/oct/05/conor-benn-fails-drugs-test-before-boxing-showdown-against-chris-eubank-jnr">tested positive for clomiphene</a>, a performance enhancing drug that can boost testosterone levels in men.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/20/chris-eubank-jr-and-liam-smith-scrap-to-save-boxings-troubled-reputation">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Forced to leave Iran after an intimate video of her was leaked, Ebrahimi has rebuilt her career.

An <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/nov/22/iran.roberttait">intimate video</a> of the actor and her boyfriend had been stolen by a man she once considered a friend, and was being sold on streets across the country.

The cops have been largely ignoring the murderous spree on their patch, because the attacker targets only sex workers and claims to be “cleansing” the area around Iran’s most sacred shrine. Meanwhile, Rahimi’s own career in Tehran has been derailed by misogyny, after her editor sexually harassed her, and office gossips turn the assault into an “affair”. She channels this fury into a reckless search for justice for the women of this dusty pilgrimage city.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/20/zar-amir-ebrahimi-holy-spider-interview">Continue reading...</a>

## What’s it like to be gay and a priest? I feel like a second-class citizen in the Church of England | Charlie Bell

<p>The final one tasted like leather. I don’t plan to eat chicken again for a long time</p><p>It began as a way to make myself a little uncomfortable, which I think is necessary in life. I wanted to return to simplicity – eat a cooked chicken every day, with no sauces, no condiments. I never imagined it would take off in the way it did. What captured people’s imaginations? A rotisserie chicken is very evocative: with even just the word, you can smell it, taste it, feel the grease beneath your fingertips. I like that it’s a simple, mundane thing.</p><p>The first chicken I ate was exciting. When I started, I began with a knife and fork, but by day 15 I was breaking it up with my hands. It made it more primal. And the flavour changed, too. At first, I enjoyed the dark meat and hated the white meat. By the end, the dark meat grossed me out. I couldn’t bear the smell or the texture of the chicken. My stomach started getting irritated from all the salt.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/20/experience-i-ate-40-rotisserie-chickens-in-40-days">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The travel writer and novelist on reading The Second Sex as an 18-year-old, discovering Proust, and the brilliance of Byron</p><p><strong>My earliest reading memory<br /></strong>I was seven years old and already drawn to distant countries when I read The Children’s Tales from Other Lands, retold by FH Lee. These were simple fables from countries that filled me with wonder: Arabia, China, Egypt, Russia. I still have my disintegrated copy of the book, scrawled with my child’s crayons.</p><p><strong>My favourite book growing up<br /></strong>In my prep school library The Log of the Ark by Kenneth Walker was the one I loved, fascinated by its tale of Noah’s gathering the animals. Some of these were imagined creatures, such as the psychotically shy “Seventy-sevenses” (named after their cabin number), and a subversive creature named the Scub. Years later I realised the book was an analogy of the Fall. The animals embark in peace, but the Scub corrupts their minds, and after landfall they hunt down or flee one another.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/20/colin-thubron-simone-de-beauvoir-altered-my-ideas-about-women">Continue reading...</a>

## Toy Fights: A Boyhood by Don Paterson review – God, brawls and jazz

<p>The poet tells the story of his early life in Dundee in vivid prose, complete with hyperbole, swearing and grumpy asides</p><p>Don Paterson does not have a typical poet’s CV. He grew up on a council estate in Dundee and left school at 16, having failed most of his Scottish Highers. Poetry is indeed entirely absent from his memoir, which takes us through his first 20 years and some extraordinarily retentive memories of working-class life. Paterson likes being jokey and grim in equal measure. How tough was his Dundee secondary school? “On a regular day, chairs were hurled through windows, legs were ripped off pigeons and shites taken in teachers’ desk drawers. Discipline was enforced through corporal punishment: officially, the threat and practice of belting children insensible with an oven-baked Lochgelly, the fork-tongued, hand-tooled leather tawse.” Some poetic licence? It is difficult to know.</p><p>The book’s title is the name of a childhood game that the author found himself doomed to play. “Toy fights” were mass brawls, begun without any reason by one child’s announcement that fighting should start. This serves as a metaphor for Paterson’s boyhood – his main fights being with “God, drugs and insanity”. God came first, when, in his early teens, Paterson joined a fundamentalist Christian sect. Its zealots are vividly recalled. Here, as elsewhere in the book, you realise that the most striking poems in his 1993 debut, Nil Nil, were versified but unedited fragments of his youth.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/20/toy-fights-a-boyhood-by-don-paterson-review-god-brawls-and-jazz">Continue reading...</a>

Opener Kill Her Freak Out, underpinned by a funereal organ sigh, imagines her killing an ex’s new lover, the words delivered with a shrug of internet-speak irony. Moments later, however, she draws the listener back in: “Can I tell you something?” she sings, her voice close: “I’ve never felt so unworthy of loving.”</p><p>It’s a trick she plays throughout; constantly zooming in and out of tales of broken relationships, toxic behaviour and addiction in ways that feel diaristic and uncomfortably relatable. The delicate Pink Balloon juxtaposes a friend’s emotional turmoil with the 26-year-old’s increasingly desperate attempts to keep things light (“I’m tryna make you laugh / Sweating like an acrobat”), while Breathing Song describes a night out turned bad (“from the bar to the ER”), before its chorus of increasingly pained “no, no, no”s acts as a much-needed universal purging.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/20/samia-honey-review-blackly-comic-indie-rock-confessionals">Continue reading...</a>

It was an uplifting, joyful spectacle.</p><p>It was also a moment of drama the unlikeliness of which underscored the various obstacles Coolidge had to clear to get there. After the awards, the most shared photo of Coolidge was one in which she struck a friendly pose with Jean Smart, who won best actress in a musical/comedy series at the Globes last year for her role in Hacks, and who, at 71, is enjoying an even more unlikely renaissance. It has been stated so often as to be tedious, but that any female actor north of 50 – let alone 60, or my god, 70 – can float back into public consciousness in a form other than the daffy Betty White model, is a rare enough phenomenon to supercharge the celebration.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/20/jennifer-coolidge-golden-globes-white-lotus-mike-white">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As the child of Bill Nighy and Diana Quick, she would be plonked in a rehearsal room after school – so it’s no surprise she’s stepping behind the camera. The film-maker talks about her extraordinary debut feature, Alice, Darling</p><p>When Mary Nighy was a young actor, an unhealthy number of scripts landed in her inbox featuring a character that went something like: “18-year-old-girl, naked, dead.” “Sexual abuse or violence is often just used as a plot device. It’s a catalyst for drama,” she says. “It doesn’t really tell you much about the experience of being abused. Or how you emerge from it.”</p><p>Now, with her first feature film as a director, she has made a film that does exactly that: exploring what it might feel like to be trapped inside a coercive, controlling and psychologically abusive relationship. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/sep/12/alice-darling-review-anna-kendrick-drama">Alice, Darling</a> is the story of an accidental intervention, after three female friends drive from Toronto to a cottage to celebrate a 30th birthday. One of the trio, Alice (Anna Kendrick) is in a relationship with Simon, a successful artist. He seems nice enough, but something about him feels off.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/20/how-do-you-have-authority-not-by-screaming-mary-nighy-on-misogyny-famous-parents-and-channelling-mary-poppins">Continue reading...</a>

## The Wife of Bath: A Biography by Marion Turner review – Chaucer’s feminist hero

<p>The Canterbury Tales’ most famous pilgrim is contextualised in a bawdy celebration of medieval womanhood</p><p>Will any literary character written this decade still be as famous in the 27th century as Chaucer’s Wife of Bath is today? The most memorable pilgrim from The Canterbury Tales, with her five husbands, her gap teeth and her big red hat, is still inspiring novels and plays, bars of soap and even organic cheeses (as one enterprising maker has it: “<a href="https://www.thecheeseshed.com/from-the-mongers-mouth/new-wyfe-of-bath">New Wyfe of Bath</a>: now merrier and extra mature!”). She’s been translated by Voltaire, Dryden and Pope (who cut out the rude bits, leaving her prologue about half its original length); depicted on screen by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/aug/07/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries">Laura Betti</a> and Julie Walters; and adapted by Jean Binta Breeze and Zadie Smith, among many others. If you’re wondering why this 14th-century figure is considered so much fun, then Marion Turner, a Chaucer biographer and Oxford professor of English literature, is here to tell you. And happily, she puts all the rude bits back in.</p><p>Referring to her heroine by her first name throughout, Turner tells us that “Alison” was “the first ordinary woman in English literature”. Unlike the allegorical princesses and sorceresses who preceded her, she is a “mercantile, working, sexually active woman”, like many of her time. Turner explains that the plague, like the first world war, created huge opportunities for women. They did go on pilgrimages, as the 14th-century Pilgrimage Window in York Minster shows. They also remarried – “Chaucer’s own mother had been widowed sometime after January 1366 and was married again before June.” They wrote books, joined guilds and hired apprentices. The Wife of Bath, a clothmaker by trade, would have been entirely familiar to Chaucer’s audience as they listened to her story about “what women want”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/20/the-wife-of-bath-a-biography-by-marion-turner-review-chaucers-feminist-hero">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For a couple of days this month, wind power supplied over half the UK’s electricity. You wouldn’t know it from our bills – or our politicians</p><p>I remember the first time wind energy emerged as a serious contender in the UK’s energy provision. It was 6 November 2012, and the country’s electricity use from wind hit an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/30/windfarms-bitter-fight-dividing-uk">all-time high</a> in the middle of the afternoon, at 9.3%. The casual observer wouldn’t have noticed, and the expert wouldn’t have been surprised, but for people between those poles, it was astonishing. Windfarms were then perceived as a nascent technology, so infant and speculative they needed endless subsidy, intervention, special pleading.</p><p>To this day, it remains a mystery how a reputation for well-meant inadequacy clings to renewable energy sources: it can’t all be the result of lobbying by the fossil fuel industry.
