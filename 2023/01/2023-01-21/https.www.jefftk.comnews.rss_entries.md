I'm a big fan of playing go on small boards: 5x5, 7x7, 9x9.  The
smaller the board the shorter the game, and when you're new playing
lots of games quickly is better for learning and keeping it fun.  I
also like that on smaller boards you're more able to substitute
reasoning for go-specific intuition, giving a better learning curve.

<p>

You can make a small go board by blocking off the corner of a larger
one, with rubber bands or pieces of cardboard, or you can sketch one
on paper, but this is not very satisfying.  Unfortunately, no one
seems to sell very small boards: you can buy <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Yellow-Mountain-Imports-Playing-Single/dp/B00EK7UIY2">9x9</a>
<a href="https://smile.amazon.com/RNK-Gaming-Beginners-Reversible-Melamine/dp/B08TQGFV65">boards</a>
but not 7x7 or 5x5.

</p>

<p>
I made a 5x5 board <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/5x5-go-board">a year ago</a>, and it
has gotten a lot of use, so I decided to make a few more.  This time I
wanted to make enough that I can keep at least one at my dad's house
and one at the office in addition to one for home.  So:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>

The process was similar to last time.  I started by cutting <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/pantry-staples-for-diy">3/4"</a> plywood into rectangles.
But how big?

</p>

<p>

The cells on a Go board aren't squares: they're traditionally ~7%
taller then they're wide.  Possibly this is to adjust for perspective
when you look down on the board at an angle?  You normally space the
lines 7/8" horizontally and 15/16" vertically, and ideally leave that
much for a margin as well, though it could be as small as 1/4" if you
had to.  This gives us:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="5">
<tr>
<th></th>
<th colspan="2">5x5</th>
<th colspan="2">7x7</th>
<th colspan="2">9x9
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Min  </th>
<td>4"</td>
<td>4 1/4"</td>
<td>5 3/4"</td>
<td>6 1/8"</td>
<td>7 1/2"</td>
<td>8"
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Ideal</th>
<td>5 1/4"</td>
<td>5 5/8"</td>
<td>7"</td>
<td>7 1/2"</td>
<td>8 3/4"</td>
<td>9 3/8"
</td>
</tr>
</table>



<p>

It's also fine if they're bigger than what I've called "ideal", if you
like a larger margin.

</p>

<p>

In looking through wood scraps some were a bit smaller than the ideal
size, but as long as I didn't go below the minimum size I knew the
grid would fit.

</p>

<p>

I cut each piece to be square, and then sanded them smooth.  Here's
the process of gridding a 7x7:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>

I started by finding the midpoint:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/7x7-go-board-two-lines-big.jpg"><img class="mobile-fullwidth" height="450" src="https://www.jefftk.com/7x7-go-board-two-lines.jpg" width="550" /><div class="image-vertical-spacer"></div></a>

</p>

<p>

I marked off ticks at 7/8 and 15/16 from the center:

</p>

<p>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/7x7-go-board-initial-ticks-big.jpg"><img class="mobile-fullwidth" height="420" src="https://www.jefftk.com/7x7-go-board-initial-ticks.jpg" width="550" /><div class="image-vertical-spacer"></div></a>

</p>

<p>

More ticks for the perimeter:

</p>

<p>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/7x7-go-board-more-ticks-big.jpg"><img class="mobile-fullwidth" height="444" src="https://www.jefftk.com/7x7-go-board-more-ticks.jpg" width="550" /><div class="image-vertical-spacer"></div></a>

</p>

<p>

Drawing in the whole grid with a straight edge:

</p>

<p>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/7x7-go-board-full-grid-big.jpg"><img class="mobile-fullwidth" height="443" src="https://www.jefftk.com/7x7-go-board-full-grid.jpg" width="550" /><div class="image-vertical-spacer"></div></a>

</p>

<p>

Starting to ink the lines.  You need to be careful to offset the
straight edge from your target line because the marker doesn't draw
exactly along the straight edge:

</p>

<p>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/7x7-go-board-beginning-inking-big.jpg"><img class="mobile-fullwidth" height="430" src="https://www.jefftk.com/7x7-go-board-beginning-inking.jpg" width="550" /><div class="image-vertical-spacer"></div></a>

</p>

<p>

Inked the rest of the lines:

</p>

<p>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/7x7-go-board-done-inking-big.jpg"><img class="mobile-fullwidth" height="419" src="https://www.jefftk.com/7x7-go-board-done-inking.jpg" width="550" /><div class="image-vertical-spacer"></div></a>

</p>

<p>

Erases the pencil marks:

</p>

<p>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/7x7-go-board-erased-big.jpg"><img class="mobile-fullwidth" height="415" src="https://www.jefftk.com/7x7-go-board-erased.jpg" width="550" /><div class="image-vertical-spacer"></div></a>

</p>

<p>

There's a little mark where I accidentally touched the marker.  I
removed it later by sanding the spot, though there's a tiny dent now.

</p>

<p>

Here are all the boards, ready for polyurethane.

</p>

<p>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/lots-of-go-boards-ready-for-poly-big.jpg"><img class="mobile-fullwidth" height="349" src="https://www.jefftk.com/lots-of-go-boards-ready-for-poly.jpg" width="550" /><div class="image-vertical-spacer"></div></a>

</p>

<p>

And after three coats of poly, protected and shiny:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>


I'm tempted to list these on Etsy, not because I want to be making
them to sell but in the hope someone will try to "rip me off" and
then people will be able to get 5x5 and 7x7 boards commercially.
