  <p id="2Rp5A7">Microsoft will shut down AltspaceVR, the social virtual reality (VR) platform it acquired in 2017 (<a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/microsoft-shutters-altspacevr-amid-company-wide-layoffs/">via <em>VentureBeat</em></a>), on March 10th, 2023. The company shared the news <a href="https://altvr.com/sunset/">in a blog post</a> just days after it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/18/23560315/microsoft-job-cuts-layoffs-2023-tech">announced job cuts affecting 10,000 workers</a>, stating the move will help shift focus “to support immersive experiences powered by Microsoft Mesh.”</p>
<p id="5Zuw0C">AltspaceVR emerged as one of the very first social VR experiences in 2015 alongside other platforms like VRChat and Rec Room. While the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/28/16055222/altspacevr-virtual-reality-social-network-shutdown-funding">startup nearly shut down in 2017</a> due to financial issues, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/03/microsoft-acquires-social-virtual-reality-app-altspacevr/">Microsoft scooped up the platform</a> as part of its efforts to build out its own mixed-reality ecosystem. Microsoft says users <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/altspace-vr/download-my-data">can download their data</a> from AltspaceVR before the shutdown.</p>

## Elon Musk teases ‘higher priced’ Twitter Blue subscription with no ads

  <p id="yNU4ys">Elon Musk says Twitter will roll out a new “higher priced” Blue subscription that doesn’t show ads on the platform. The current $7.99 per month Twitter Blue subscription promises <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/10/23503355/twitter-blue-verification-elon-musk-phone-number-ads">50 percent fewer ads</a> when compared to “non-verified people,” although this feature hasn’t been rolled out yet.</p>
<p id="44QUYT">A more expensive, ad-free subscription might be Twitter’s answer to Blue’s disappointing subscriber numbers and Twitter’s 40 percent decline in ad revenue, something <em>The Verge</em>’s Alex Heath <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/19/23563429/twitters-legal-woes-are-mounting">reports on in his latest <em>Command Line</em> newsletter</a>. In addition to the new tier, Musk says Twitter’s also working on a way to decrease the frequency and size of ads on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1599835876905070593?s=20&amp;t=QQW1ZhtFBHWgojEktUnr-A">which he’s hinted at in the past</a>. </p>

## Motorola’s viva magenta Edge 30 Fusion is fun, and fun is good

  <p id="JssP5k">There’s really no sensible argument for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/2/23490142/motorola-edge-30-fusion-viva-magenta-pantone-color-of-the-year-2023">the viva magenta Motorola Edge 30 Fusion</a>. It’s $799 and doesn’t include wireless charging, an IP68 rating, or a telephoto camera. You should get, like, at least two of those things for $800 in 2023. But here’s the thing: it’s fun, and fun is seriously underrated when it comes to smartphones.</p>
<p id="M8HAiV">A lot of that fun factor has to do with the Edge 30 Fusion’s best and most obvious feature: its color. I think it’s pink, but my sources (<a href="https://twitter.com/allisonjo1/status/1613300310277259272">a lot of people on Twitter</a>) tell me that it is, in fact, red. And not just any red: viva magenta, the <a href="https://www.pantone.com/color-of-the-year/2023">official 2023 Pantone Color of the Year</a>. </p>

  <p id="hdDNwL">Buying a kid a Kindle is great for two reasons. First off, it encourages them to read at a young age. Second, it serves as a great distraction that might save your sanity when you're both stuck inside on a rainy day. That’s why you might want to take a look at today’s deal on the kid-friendly version of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23409106/amazon-kindle-2022-e-reader-review-test-price-specs-features"><strong>Kindle</strong></a>, which has dropped to a new all-time low. Regularly $119.99, you can currently buy the latest model for $84.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B4GC9TJT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://shop-links.co/ciXFv32q9tW" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1546729/2092?subId1=VergeBestKindleDeals121322&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-kindle-kids-6-e-reader-2022-release%2F-%2FA-87644277" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Target</a>. </p>
<p id="l9K5me">The Kindle Kids is exactly like the standard Kindle. It touts the same high-resolution, 300dpi display and a dark mode, along with USB-C support and marathon battery life. However, the kid-centric model lacks ads, comes with one of three vibrant covers, and provides a few additional...</p>

  <p id="MxCAdB">Google’s decision to let go of 12,000 employees was only just announced on Friday, but it extended the recent trend of the “Big Tech” companies cutting jobs in previously unheard-of numbers, and now we’ve seen more reports about where those cuts happened. </p>

  <p id="UIT0rj">Twitter’s next update should make it less insistent that you use the “For You” algorithmic timeline, according to a <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1616594332907372544">tweet from Elon Musk</a>. He says the app will “stop switching you back to recommended tweets,” and remember if you left it on the reverse-chronological “Following” timeline or a pinned list.</p>
<p id="mB7vC3">Musk’s promises should be taken with a grain of salt, but I hope the company delivers on this one. Until last month, Twitter <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/6/21167920/twitter-chronological-feed-how-to-ios-android-app-timeline">had a button</a> that let you set a preference on which version of the timeline you wanted to use. That option went away when the company rolled out a UI that let you <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/10/23549368/twitter-for-you-page-tiktok-following-tab">swipe between the two timelines</a>, with the app defaulting to opening on the algorithmic one.</p>
