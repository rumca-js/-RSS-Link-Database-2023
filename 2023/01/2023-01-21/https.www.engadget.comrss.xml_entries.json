US District Court Judge Denise Cote imposed a lifetime ban on Shkreli that prohibits him from participating in the pharmaceutical industry early last year. Cote ruled that the former pharma exec orchestrated an illegal anticompetitive scheme to gain a monopoly over Daraprim, a life-saving anti-malarial and anti-parasitic drug.&nbsp;</p><p>After Shkreli's former company, Turing Pharmaceuticals, obtained the manufacturing license for Daraprim, it raised the drug's prices from $17.50 to $750 per tablet. Cote sided with the FTC in the antitrust lawsuit the agency filed against Shkreli in 2020 and ordered him to pay<a href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/antitrust/martin-shkreli-fined-64m-banned-from-pharma-industry-ny-ag\"> $64.6 million</a> in damages, in addition to imposing a lifetime industry ban against him. Prior to Druglike's launch, Shkreli <a href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/securities-law/pharma-bro-shkreli-fails-to-pause-industry-bar-pending-appeal\">tried (and failed) to convince</a> a judge to put the ban on hold, arguing that the public could benefit from his future contributions to the industry. Shkreli challenged the ban while he was serving time in federal prison after receiving a seven-year sentence in 2017 for defrauding investors. He was released from prison in May.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The FTC said it started asking Shkreli for a compliance report and access to relevant records, as well as asking him to sit for an interview regarding Druglike, in October 2022. However, the company co-founder kept on disregarding its &quot;repeated requests.&quot; The agency also said that Shkreli <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/20/ftc-asks-judge-to-hold-martin-shkreli-in-contempt-of-court-for-forming-new-drug-firm.html\">has yet to pay</a> any amount of his $64.6 million fine.

Of course not,&quot; he added, regarding Twitter's character limits. If you'll recall, Musk famously tweeted in August 2018 that he was &quot;considering taking Tesla private at $420&quot; and that he was already able to secure funding. &quot;Investor support is confirmed,&quot; he said in a follow-up tweet.</p><p>The CEO later <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-13-elon-musk-defends-tweets-on-taking-tesla-private.html\">revealed</a> that he was in talks with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, which reportedly expressed interest in Tesla as part of the country's bid to lessen its reliance on oil.

Tesla's shares apparently remained highly volatile in the weeks that followed. The executive, however, downplayed his tweets' impact and said that they don't necessarily affect stock prices: &quot;There have been many cases where I thought that if I were to tweet something, the stock price would go down. For example, at one point I tweeted that I thought that, in my opinion, the stock price was too high...and it went went higher, which was, which is, you know, counterintuitive.&quot;</p><p>In addition to the shareholder lawsuit, the Securities and Exchange Commission <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-27-government-sues-tesla-and-elon-musk-over-privatization-tweets.html\">sued Musk</a> over his tweets, calling them &quot;false and misleading statements&quot; that could be constituted as fraud. Musk and Tesla paid $20 million each to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-29-elon-musk-settles-with-sec.html\">settle with the SEC</a>, and the executive had to step down as board chairman. The SEC also required company lawyers to approve any Tesla-related tweet Musk makes \u2014 a condition the CEO tried (and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-cant-get-out-of-his-sec-oversight-deal-085515038.html\">failed</a>) to get out of last year.&nbsp;</p><p>Aside from defending his tweets, Musk criticized short sellers during his testimony, telling the court that short-selling &quot;should be made illegal.&quot; He added: &quot;It is a means for, in my opinion, bad people on Wall Street to steal money from investors. Not good.&quot; Another piece of information to take away from his time on the witness stand is that nobody can tell Musk to stop tweeting. When lawyers asked him about the advice he got to refrain from posting on Twitter after calling a British cave diver a &quot;pedo guy,&quot; Musk said: &quot;I continued to tweet, yes.&quot;</p><p>According to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/musk-expected-take-stand-trial-resumes-over-tesla-tweet-2023-01-20/\"><em>Reuters</em></a>, Musk only testified for less than 30 minutes and that he's not done answering lawyers' questions.
