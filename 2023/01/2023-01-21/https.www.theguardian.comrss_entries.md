## The Starling Girl review – Eliza Scanlen shines in transgressive coming of age drama

<p><strong>Sundance film festival:</strong> the Sharp Objects star steals the spotlight as a 17-year-old fundamentalist Christian in an intoxicating, forbidden relationship with her older youth pastor</p><p>The Starling Girl, the feature debut from writer-director Laurel Parmet, sets forth two difficult, easily muddled tasks. First, striking the correct tonal balance for a sexual relationship separated by age and authority – in this case, an intoxicating, transgressive romance between 17-year-old Jem Starling (Eliza Scanlen) and her brusquely handsome, 28-year-old youth pastor Owen (Lewis Pullman, son of actor Bill). And the second, depicting an insular religious community – a group of fundamentalist Christians in present-day Kentucky – with enough specificity and emotional acuity to bridge the gap with viewers who will find such a place opaque, unrelatable or possibly even unbelievable.</p><p>Parmet succeeds more on the former than the latter. The Starling Girl, anchored by a bristling performance from the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/20/eliza-scanlen-little-women-australian-interview">always solid Scanlen</a>, is at its best when it hews to the combustible suspense of a teenage girl glimpsing her own instincts – for honesty, for autonomy, and most threateningly for pleasure. It’s ultimately less a portrait of a toxic relationship – that’s not the tone of Owen and Jem’s connection here – than a familiar battle of faith and feelings, intuition versus indoctrination, the fine line between sin and sublime.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/21/the-starling-girl-movie-review-eliza-scanlen-sundance-film-festival">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Great strikers win games and yet they can disrupt tactical systems where dominating the ball is crucial – just like at  City</p><p>Erling Haaland is a phenomenon. It’s not just that he has scored 22 goals already this season, plus a further five goals in the Champions League. It’s the sense he offers of being unstoppable: almost unbeatable for pace, almost impossible to knock off the ball and with a clinical eye for goal as well.</p><p>His phlegmatic, almost flippant, personality makes him more terrifying. He jokes about the secret target he has set himself for this season. He is not some driven self-improver: he scores goals in record-breaking numbers seemingly because he finds it funny. He plays football like the early developer in year eight and as such finds the game almost laughably easy. In the history of the sport there has been only a tiny handful of forwards who have combined such physical and technical prowess.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jan/21/erling-haaland-system-based-teams-and-the-role-of-the-goalscorer">Continue reading...</a>

<ul><li>Pool A: Exeter 40-3 Castres</li><li>Scrappy French side pick up one red card and three yellows</li></ul><p>They claim a home tie in the final 16, but Exeter looked as off-colour in overcoming a motiveless Castres as any of the English sides who have laboured through this year’s edition. Six tries and 40 points may look comfortable enough, but Castres defied expectation to cause their hosts real problems.</p><p>Exeter came up trumps in this one on the card lottery. Castres were shown four of them, one red, three in three minutes just before the break. In the 37th minute they were penalised by first a red, then a yellow, then a penalty try. It is a wonder they did not implode, given that reduced them to 12. That they did in the last 10 was sort of inevitable.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/21/henry-slade-shows-his-old-class-as-exeter-overcome-card-happy-castres">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It has been so long since Newcastle last conceded a goal in the Premier League that even Eddie Howe might not remember who scored it. Yet another clean sheet – their sixth in succession – ensured that his side moved above Manchester United into third spot in the table despite failing to find a breakthrough against a stubborn Crystal Palace defence.</p><p>For the record, Romain Perraud’s consolation for Southampton back on 6 November was the previous occasion that Nick Pope had to pick the ball out of his own net in a league match and, apart from the brilliant second half save by the England goalkeeper to deny substitute Jean-Philippe Mateta, that record never looked like ending here.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/21/crystal-palace-newcastle-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I spent my youth running away from my mother’s Holocaust story. As mother to the grandchildren she never knew, I ached to know more</p><p>My mother had four different first names, depending on which language she was speaking at the time. She was <em>Anka</em> in German, <em>Hanka</em> in Polish, <em>Chanka</em> in Yiddish, and after arriving in Australia on a refugee passport in 1949, she adopted the anglicised version of herself, <em>Hannah</em>. Her surname was Altman, although after she married my father, that vestige of her former life disappeared too. The only remnants of her years in Europe were captured in a few black-and-white photographs kept in an old shoebox, hidden away in the hallway cupboard, together with a leather suitcase and tailored winter coat she never wore. As a young girl, I would secretly rummage through these photos, searching for my mother’s story in the anonymous faces I knew no longer walked this earth.</p><p>When the ghosts of her past became too much for her to bear, my mother took her own life. I was 21 years old at the time, left to deal with my own ghosts. More than 30 years later, on one otherwise uneventful Sunday afternoon, I tried to resurrect my mother’s past.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/22/stalking-the-dead-how-tracing-old-photographs-helped-me-resurrect-my-mothers-past">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Arsenal and Manchester United managers have boldly redeployed their defensive players in adapted roles</p><p>It was in the heat of summer that Mikel Arteta finally decided to press the button on a strategy he had been brewing for almost a year. For much of the previous season he had become convinced that Ben White was a right-back in the making: quick, calm on the ball and blessed with sound positional sense and a high level of tactical intelligence. The problem was everyone else. None of the squad, he decided, was capable of replacing White in the centre of defence.</p><p>For some time Arteta had been searching for full-backs who could play his way: stepping up into a narrower role when Arsenal had the ball, effectively mutating into central midfielders. Over his three seasons at the club he had tried and discarded Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Héctor Bellerín on the right, Nuno Tavares and even Bukayo Saka on the left.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/21/arteta-and-ten-hag-take-inspiration-from-cruyff-in-their-full-back-fluidity">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Sarajevo-born author on his new historical novel’s multilingual sensibility, turning screenwriter for The Matrix sequel and pretending to be Kevin Keegan</p><p>Aleksandar Hemon, 58, was born in Sarajevo and lives in New Jersey. His diverse output includes <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/06/fiction">The Lazarus Project</a></em> (2008), a novel drawing on the 1908 shooting of a Jewish migrant by Chicago police; the autobiographical essay collection <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/apr/14/aleksandar-hemon-book-lives-review">The Book of My Lives</a></em> (2013), which discusses the death of Hemon’s second child; and the screenplay for <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/25/the-matrix-resurrections-review-keanu-reeves-carrie-anne-moss">The Matrix Resurrections</a></em>, co-written with Lana Wachowski and David Mitchell. His new book, <em>The World and All That It Holds</em>, is a century-spanning, cross-continental polyglot gay romance between two conscripts, one Jewish, one Muslim, who fall in love fighting the first world war in central Europe. Hemon spoke from his office at Princeton University, where he has been teaching creative writing since 2018.</p><p><strong>Where did </strong><em><strong>The World and All That It Holds</strong></em><strong> begin?</strong><br />I signed a contract for the book in 2010 and cleared my schedule that fall to work on it, and then my daughter got ill and died that year. I’ve since written four other books and many other things while working on it on and off because I have this ability – more like a deformation – to work on about seven things at the same time; I react to stress with hypermania and feel a compulsion to make stuff. I like history books about wars and spies and was reading the memoirs of a British spy, Frederick Bailey, who in 1918 was in Tashkent [in Uzbekistan, then under Russian rule]. The Bolsheviks are looking for him when he runs into a Sarajevan guy from the secret police, who says: “Let’s work together. I want to get out of here too, back to Sarajevo.” This guy devises an exit for them by hiring Bailey to hunt for himself; I liked that! My boys, Pinto and Osman, have a different setup, but that’s what started me thinking.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/21/aleksandar-hemon-a-book-isnt-a-car-not-everything-has-to-work">Continue reading...</a>

## Jarrod Bowen double boosts West Ham and turns up heat on Lampard’s Everton

<p>There were times when it was difficult to shake off the impression that Everton simply wanted to do David Moyes a favour. This sorry performance has probably kept their former manager in a job. One more defeat could have spelled the end for Moyes at West Ham but they have been spared having to make that decision after spending 90 minutes in the company of Everton, who are joint bottom and look likely to stay there.</p><p>The chants of “sack the board” from the travelling support during the closing stages summed it up. Frank Lampard may well lose his job but the reality is that the overall blame for Everton’s malaise lies elsewhere. Changing the manager alone is unlikely to be enough. Everton are spiralling under their current ownership and, although Lampard may pay for this defeat with his job given that Farhad Moshiri was present at a game for the first time since October 2021, it is difficult to know if anyone can keep this team up. West Ham, who rose out of the bottom three thanks to a double from Jarrod Bowen, could have played all day without conceding.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/21/west-ham-everton-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Scot’s feats at the Australian Open have been all the more enthralling for coming at the end of his career, not the peak</p><p>Over the past week at the Australian Open in Melbourne Sir Andy Murray has often seemed more like a medieval knight than a tennis player, undergoing the kinds of physical trials and feats of endurance that were the stuff of chivalric romances. He’s even carried a war wound from previous campaigns, a metal plate that supports a damaged hip. But in the end, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/21/andy-murray-australian-open-battling-defeat-to-roberto-bautista-agut">despite a heroic effort on Saturday,</a> he couldn’t quite slay the dragon – or at least his third-round opponent, Roberto Bautista Agut.</p><p>To have done so, he would have had to rewrite not just courtly literature but the record books. No one had ever played more than nine hours in the first two matches of a tennis tournament and gone on to win their third match. Murray played for a combined 10 hours and 34 minutes to beat Matteo Berrettini and Thanasi Kokkinakis in two epic five-setters.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/21/andy-murray-rolled-back-years-but-even-heroes-have-limits">Continue reading...</a>

## You’ll grow out of them: trainers transformed into plants – in pictures

<p>Though artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/monsieur_plant/?hl=en">Christophe Guinet</a> was born in Paris and loves the urban environment, he’s always felt in touch with nature. “I’ve been passionate about plants since adolescence. I fell in love with orchids at age 15 and learned to cultivate them. They require patience but they are worth it.” Guinet went on to work in marketing until a trip to India eight years ago to escape the corporate grind. There he conceived his art persona, <a href="https://monsieurplant.com/">Monsieur Plant </a>(“Well, I am a mister who likes plants”), and started combining human-made consumer goods with plants to create fantastical sculptures. One recurring motif is the trainer, which is “a symbol of our times”, he says. “The eloquence of the plants combats the excesses of consumerism. I think nature will always triumph over man.”  See more at <em><a href="http://monsieurplant.com/">monsieurplant.com</a></em></p><p></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2023/jan/21/youll-grow-out-of-them-trainers-transformed-into-plants-in-pictures">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The innovative Australian director who gained acclaim for his version of Yerma starring Billie Piper is now reframing Phaedra as a postmenopausal love story with Janet McTeer</p><p>Simon Stone does things differently. As a young director he was described as the enfant terrible of Australian theatre. He’s 38 years old now so no longer an “enfant”, while his reputation has spread far beyond Australia and beyond theatre, too, into film and opera. But a few days before interviewing him, I overhear two members of his latest ensemble discussing how disconcerting it is to work with him. They’ve not experienced anything like it, they say. They’re never quite sure when rehearsals will begin, because he spends every morning writing that day’s scenes.</p><p>Can this really be any more than an excuse for being a chronic oversleeper, I ask, when we meet after his sixth day of rehearsals for his version of <em>Phaedra</em> at the National Theatre. He laughs and says that this very morning he was up early writing with his five-month-old daughter on his knee. “And she kept just sort of typing, with me having to correct the typos that she was making.” The point, he adds, is not to put actors on the spot, but to enable them to collaborate in the creation of the text from day to day through their improvisations in the rehearsal room.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jan/21/director-simon-stone-my-heroes-are-women-phaedra-janet-mcteer-national-theatre-billie-piper-yerma">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Revisiting things we love often leads to disappointment. But there was this mousse with mussels, and I can’t resist…</p><p>At this time of year, it’s tempting to devote a space like this to the making and breaking of kitchen resolutions (I refuse to say the word diet). But I’m going to be awkward, and save all that for next month. January is bad enough without talk of waistlines. What about some happy news instead, like the fact that the beloved and supremely talented chef Henry Harris quietly opened his new restaurant, Bouchon Racine, shortly before Christmas?</p><p>Look, I can’t be the only person in the world who will forever carry with me the memory of at least half a dozen dishes all of which were so unimpeachably delicious at the time – a combination of circumstances as well as ingredients – they will surely remain unmatched for the rest of my days. Just as I will never eat a crab sandwich as good as the one I devoured at a pub in Seahouses in Northumberland after a long walk in filthy weather, no grilled chicken with rice and tomatoes will ever live up to those that were served to a dripping wet me (I’d been swimming) on an old boat in the middle of a lake in Turkey a whole lifetime ago. I eat <em>knafeh</em>, oozing sugar syrup and soft white cheese, whenever I see it. But I’ve never tasted any so delicious as the slice I hungrily forked up beneath the fluorescent strip lights of a Ramallah sweet shop in 2005, my reward for days of hard work.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/21/some-dishes-stay-with-you-forever-should-i-go-looking-for-that-perfect-moment-again-rachel-cooke">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The actor and director on his fears for a British institution, the day he stopped being vegetarian and why he’s a fast eater</p><p><strong>I’m going to disappoint you with my terribly proletarian tastes. </strong>If I was to be hanged in the morning, which is quite possible, I would have beans on toast. Because I love that and I have that on a Sunday very regularly because it just makes me happy. I’ve tried to be much more adventurous over the years, but I’m basically working-class, proletarian filth and it’s very hard to eradicate some of those things.</p><p><strong>I was a vegetarian for 15 years and I stopped about 2000, </strong>a year after <em>The League of Gentlem</em><em>en</em> was first on TV. Even though things had got so much better for vegetarians, I remember sitting somewhere in Soho and looking at this menu and there were three things I could eat. And I just thought: “Fuck it!” So I had some chicken and it was incredibly bland and I thought: “I’ve blown it, I’ve wasted 15 years of proper abstinence for this bland chicken!” Then the next day I had a bacon sandwich and everything was all right.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/21/mark-gatiss-im-genuinely-terrified-that-we-are-losing-the-caff-for-ever">Continue reading...</a>

## Paul Clarvis, Liam Noble, Cathy Jordan: Freight Train review – quite a ride

<p>(Village Life)<br />Irish folk singer Cathy Jordan, with Clarvis and Noble on percussion and piano, works her magic on songs ranging from Duke Ellington to Mose Allison</p><p>It starts with Dear Somebody, a harmless little waltz sung by the sweet, folky voice of <a href="https://www.cathyjordan.ie/about">Cathy Jordan</a> (of Irish traditional band <a href="https://www.dervish.ie/">Dervish</a>), accompanied by piano (<a href="https://www.trinitylaban.ac.uk/students-and-staff/staff-biographies/liam-noble/">Liam Noble</a>) and drums (<a href="https://www.ram.ac.uk/people/paul-clarvis">Paul Clarvis</a>). It’s all nice and cosy, except for a short instrumental passage, when the drums and piano sound as though they’re struggling to escape. Is it a gag? Could be. Just listen to the other 12 tracks and enjoy the ride. Next comes Don’t Worry About a Thing, the first of four Mose Allison numbers. The folky voice becomes a tough, admonitory blues one, perfect for Allison’s unique blend of down-home blues and wry metropolitan wit.</p><p>The other tracks are mainly songs from the past with something memorable about them: The Glow Worm with its clever lyrics; the yearning Isle of Innisfree, helped along here by an unnamed whistler; Duke Ellington’s Mood Indigo, revealing yet another, darker side to Jordan’s remarkable voice. <a href="https://paulclarvis.bandcamp.com/releases">The whole album</a> adds up to a very agreeable 50-odd minutes, but beware. A long-forgotten tune, suddenly heard again, can stick to you like glue. It happened to me with this title track, Freight Train, a hit in the mid-1950s, when I first heard it. Now I can’t shake it. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/21/paul-clarvis-liam-noble-cathy-jordan-freight-train-review-quite-a-ride">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The new social network and its interconnected ‘fediverse’ is a welcome alternative to blustering rival Twitter and Elon Musk</p><p>When Twitter first appeared in July 2006, I was enchanted by it. At one point, some geek created an app that logged tweets and geolocated them in real time on a map of the world, so you could watch little dots popping up all over the globe. (I even made a short video recording of my screen and set it to music, but didn’t put it online because I didn’t own the music rights, and now I can’t find it. Sigh – such is digital life.)</p><p>What I loved about Twitter at the beginning was that it enabled you to plug into the thought streams of people you liked or admired. Like all good things, though, that came to an end when the platform <a href="https://medium.com/message/the-algorithm-giveth-but-it-also-taketh-b7efad92bc1f">embarked on the algorithmic curation of users’ feeds</a> to increase “engagement” (and, it hoped, profits). And from then on, it became increasingly tiresome, though I kept my account. But when it became clear that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/25/twitter-elon-musk-buy-takeover-deal-tesla">Elon Musk was going to buy the platform</a> – and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23551060/elon-musk-twitter-takeover-layoffs-workplace-salute-emoji">wreak havoc</a> – I decided to explore possible alternatives.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/21/back-to-the-future-how-mastodon-is-restoring-the-lost-art-of-online-conversation">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The reality show in which mothers and sons live together and start flirting is weirdly kinky but also oddly natural</p><p>If you’re a woman of a certain age, struggling in the housing crisis, you could always check into <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/18/milf-manor-dating-show-tlc">Milf Manor</a></em>. It’s a new US reality show in which women and their sons live in a house together and then all the ladies and all the guys flirt with each other (Milf stands for Mum I’d Love to Fuck, in case you didn’t know). In the search for a new hit, <em>Milf Manor</em>’s producers have gone back to the oldest human drive on the planet, the mother of them all: the original dyad between a baby and their primary caregiver. Maternal love, filial love, carnal love and erotic love blend together in a mutually jealous, weirdly kinky, televised Freudian melange. It’s natural, it’s normal, it’s common, it’s fine! After all, Sophocles wrote <em>Oedipus Rex</em> 400 years before the birth of Christ. Once you pass 40, you become invisible to men in their 30s while every 20-year-old on the planet notices you, including waiters, security guards, interns and other women’s sons. I can explain it in one word: perimenopause. When wise Mother Nature realises your ship is sailing, she starts wafting out your erotic pheromones at double strength like novelty cocktails during happy hour at the last-chance saloon and you attract those virile young males who are biologically best able to “pollinate the flower”. <em>Milf Manor</em> is airing on the cable network TLC, which also happens to stand for Tender Loving Care. As the guys queueing to visit <em>Milf Manor</em> know, that’s exactly what you get when you come to Mummy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/21/will-we-be-able-to-look-away-from-the-mummy-issues-raised-on-milf-manor">Continue reading...</a>

## Holy Spider – prurient Iranian serial killer drama

<p>Based on the real-life case of a man who murdered 16 women, Ali Abbasi’s tense film feels at once timely and dehumanising</p><p>The third feature from Copenhagen-based Iranian director Ali Abbasi shares with his breakthrough film, the troll-thriller <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/09/border-review-ali-abbasi">Border</a></em>, a fascination with the monsters that lurk on the fringes of society. But in this Persian-language picture, based on a real-life serial killer who murdered 16 sex workers in the Iranian city of Mashhad, the monster is not just a single individual, but a wider culture of misogyny.</p><p>It’s a timely release, adding to the spotlight on women’s rights and roles in Iranian society, and driven by two impressive performances – from theatre actor Mehdi Bajestani as the murderer, and Zar Amir Ebrahimi, playing Rahimi, the female investigative journalist reporting on the case. It’s a tense, atmospheric piece of film-making but it made me profoundly uncomfortable – and not, I should add, in a good way. There’s a prurience in how the murders are filmed – the camera hungrily scouring the distorted faces of dying women – that borders on dehumanising. This, combined with the fact that it’s the female journalist, rather than any of the victims, whose character is developed, unintentionally supports the idea that some women’s lives are worth more than others.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/21/holy-spider-prurient-iranian-serial-killer-drama-ali-abbasi">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The 1,000th game of Jürgen Klopp’s managerial career will not be remembered with fondness, if indeed it is remembered at all. Liverpool and Chelsea played out a flat goalless draw at Anfield that demonstrated why both are languishing in mid-table and struggling to realise their Champions League ambitions.</p><p>Kai Havertz had an early goal ruled out by VAR but otherwise there were few incidents and precious little quality on display from either the hosts or Graham Potter’s visitors. The usual stakes in the fixture were lowered with Liverpool and Chelsea 10 points off Champions League qualification in ninth and 10th place respectively. The league positions flattered both teams on the basis of a truly dreadful first half in particular, when four minutes of stoppage time in freezing temperatures passed for a cruel joke. Chelsea performed with more control and composure, but that was only in comparison to a careless and aimless Liverpool display.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/21/liverpool-chelsea-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>(Domino) <br />The 80-year-old’s latest album features some inspired younger guests but cries out for less dated beats and a visionary producer</p><p>Last year, a remarkable rock’n’roll time capsule came to light. Unheard for more than 50 years, Lou Reed’s acoustic demos for his soon-to-be band – the Velvet Underground – were released, revealing one of the most important cultural partnerships of the 20th century in its infancy. If that claim sounds inflated, as well as motivating a great many taboo-busting creatives prone to wearing shades, the Velvet Underground also inspired superfan Václav Havel and Czechoslovakia’s resistance to Soviet totalitarianism.</p><p>The other person in the room with Reed was Welshman <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/oct/26/john-cale-by-cate-le-bon-gruff-rhys-and-james-dean-bradfield">John Cale</a>, whose mastery of repetition and drone – one gleaned from his studies in the New York noise avant garde – made the Velvet Underground just as groundbreaking as Reed’s chemically frank lyrics. Cale’s body of work since has covered an extraordinary amount of territory, encompassing experimental offerings, notable collaboration, soundtrack and production work – Patti Smith, the list goes on – as well as albums of his own songcraft.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/21/john-cale-mercy-review-the-titan-of-cool-misses-a-trick">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The film director, 60, on what inspires him, the life-changing meeting he had with his wife, and why running away from home was his first act of rebellion</p><p><strong>I grew up in a tiny</strong> country town in New South Wales, about 180 miles north of Sydney. It was like living on an island. There were 11 or so houses, and a gas station, and a farm. For a while we ran the local cinema. </p><p><strong>When my father came out</strong> of the Vietnam war we were forced to have extremely short hair. This was the 70s, when if you didn’t have long hair you were a dead person, so it was a big problem. My parents broke up, I got estranged from my dad, and ended up in Sydney with the freedom to grow my hair. I’ve got really curly hair, and all the mean kids at the Christian Brothers’ College I went to started calling me Basil Brush, which then became Baz, which I then painted on the side of my school bag. When I was 19 I changed my name by deed poll to Bazmark.

<p>Matteo Messina Denaro was arrested this week after three decades on the run. During that time he went out for pizza, watched football, and even took selfies with his GP</p><p>At 8.20am last Monday, Andrea Bonafede was queueing at the check-in of a private medical clinic in Palermo, Sicily. Suffering from colon cancer and thought to be 59, he had already undergone two operations and chemotherapy at the clinic, often bringing the staff presents of olive oil and exchanging phone numbers, and text messages, with his fellow patients. He was known to dress in flashy clothes: that morning he was wearing a sheepskin coat, a white hat, Ray-Ban shades and an expensive Franck Muller watch.</p><p>Waiting for his Covid test, he went outside and walked towards the Fiat Brava, and the driver, that had brought him there. The undercover officers watching him worried that he had realised he was under surveillance and that he might be about to bolt. A colonel from the Carabinieri, Italy’s militarised police, decided to move in: “Are you <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/17/captured-mafia-boss-matteo-messina-denaro-living-modest-apartment">Matteo Messina Denaro</a>?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/21/how-mafia-scarlet-pimpernel-eluded-capture-for-30-years-matteo-messina-denaro">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Linbury theatre, Royal Opera House; Wigmore Hall, London</strong><br />The sad fate of Rosemary Kennedy is strikingly told by Irish National Opera. Plus, the female French composer we should all know about…</p><p>A mesh of squares and rectangles, charts, grids and graph paper forms the visual harness in which the central character in <strong><a href="https://www.roh.org.uk/tickets-and-events/least-like-the-other-by-netia-jones-details">Least Like the Other</a></strong> is held immobile. The human instinct to engineer and make straight that which is socially wayward and irregular is explored in sharp focus, its tragic consequences laid bare, in this one-act work performed by <a href="https://www.irishnationalopera.ie/whats-on/current-upcoming-productions/least-like-the-other">Irish National Opera</a> at the Royal Opera’s Linbury theatre. The composer Brian Irvine and co-creator Netia Jones (director, designer and video designer) have sifted the evidence – interviews, newspaper reports, newsreel – and woven an engrossing docu-opera for four performers and small orchestra, part scored, part improvised.</p><p>The result is a many-layered meditation on the eldest sister of John F Kennedy, one of America’s brilliant Kennedy dynasty but considered decidedly less gleaming than her eight siblings. After a lobotomy in 1941 at the age of 23, Rosemary – superbly sung by the young Irish soprano <a href="https://www.amynifhearraigh.com/">Amy Ní Fhearraigh</a> – lived away from public view until her death <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/jan/11/guardianobituaries.usa">in 2005</a>. For most patients, a lobotomy dulled the senses into “perpetual marble calm”, as Sylvia Plath described it in <em>The Bell Jar</em>. This short-lived and brutal form of psychosurgery was in its fashionable infancy. The promise of a panacea for all mental ills proved irresistible, not least to Rosemary’s father, Joseph P Kennedy Sr, who secretly arranged the procedure for his sweet, beautiful but unstable daughter.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/21/least-like-the-other-review-linbury-searching-for-rosemary-kennedy-irish-national-opera-royal-opera-house-brian-irvine-netia-jones-elena-urioste-tom-poster-wigmore-hall">Continue reading...</a>

## Classical home listening: Paavo Järvi returns to Bruckner 7; I Giardini play Caroline Shaw

<p>Järvi and the the Tonhalle-Orchester Zürich hit a sweet spot in their Bruckner cycle. And Shaw’s work beguiles, whether on piano, cello or flower pots</p><p>• <strong>Anton</strong> <strong>Bruckner</strong> inspires a special devotion (or the opposite), so if a conductor chooses to record a Bruckner cycle, the possibility is that they will have insights to bring. Not helpful for anyone starting out, given the countless recordings available, from the brazenly apocalyptic to the quiveringly spiritual: from Karajan, Abbado and Haitink to Daniel Barenboim, Christian Thielemann and Iván Fischer.</p><p><strong>Paavo Järvi</strong>’s <a href="https://www.prestomusic.com/classical/products/9405556--bruckner-symphony-no-7">new account of </a><strong><a href="https://www.prestomusic.com/classical/products/9405556--bruckner-symphony-no-7">Symphony No 7</a></strong> (1884) (Alpha Classics) – he recorded it live with a different orchestra a decade ago – shows the <strong>Tonhalle-Orchester Zürich</strong> in peak condition. Tempos never drag. The orchestral sound is detailed and expansive, woodwind expressive, brass white-hot. Colours are rich, tenderness offsetting majesty. The big climaxes, exciting but controlled, avoid that Brucknerian tendency to sound laboured; no indulgence here. This impressive account is part of a symphonic cycle that concludes next year.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/21/bruckner-symphony-no-7-tonhalle-orchester-zurich-jarvi-review-caroline-shaw-the-wheel-i-giardini">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A mighty but simple, jade-coloured dish that has taken on new life in my kitchen</p><p>One of the mightiest recipes to come out of the US in recent years is <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019134-kale-sauce-pasta">Joshua McFadden’s kale sauce pasta</a>, in which 450g cavolo nero is transformed into a deeply delicious, jade-coloured pasta sauce. It’s impressive on many levels: the sheer volume of green, for a start, the simplicity of it and the excellent flavour (which is in part, I think, due to the parmesan). I have made it multiple times, but without the parmesan, adding some fennel, chilli and miso. Like all the best recipes, it has taken on new life in my kitchen and, with thanks to Joshua, I’d like to share my adaptation with you.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/21/miso-butter-greens-pasta-vegan-recipe-meera-sodha">Continue reading...</a>

Later in the day, the sun’s rays reflecting off the water will cover my cabin ceiling in rippling patterns.</p><p>This morning something completely unexpected happened. I woke up and looked out of my window and saw a cormorant in the canal. Now this isn’t very unusual because you see them on inland water quite often. It dived underwater and popped up again a few metres away, coal black and shining beautifully. Suddenly there was a flash of azure blue and orange, like the glow of a winter sunset, as a kingfisher whizzed by in hot pursuit of the cormorant, which flew up, up and away!</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/21/young-country-diary-the-cormorant-v-the-kingfisher">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Vicky Krieps shows her emotional range as a woman taking ownership of terminal illness in Emily Atef’s sensitive film co-starring the late Gaspard Ulliel</p><p>Cinema has traditionally had a rather dubious relationship with the subject of terminal disease. Imminent death is dressed up in a decorative swirl of romance; patients tend to remain photogenically asymptomatic until the last possible moment. But director and co-writer Emily Atef’s <em>More Than Ever</em> is different. This French and English-language drama is a film about taking ownership over the end of life; about dying personally and, if necessary, selfishly.</p><p>Vicky Krieps, so wonderfully frosty and autocratic in <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/01/corsage-review-vicky-krieps-mesmerises-as-rebellious-18th-century-royal-marie-kreutzer-elisabeth-of-austria">Corsage</a></em>, shows another, more emotionally friable side of her considerable range as Hélène. Diagnosed with a degenerative lung disease, Hélène is struggling to come to terms with an aspect of her life – its cessation – that she is unable to fully share with her husband, Matthieu (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/19/gaspard-ulliel-french-actor-dies-skiing-accident">the late Gaspard Ulliel</a> in one of his final film roles). Finding it increasingly hard to deal with his desperate, dogged optimism, she turns to the internet, trawling through end-of-life blogs. There she finds a kindred spirit in “Mister” (Bjørn Floberg), who has cancer and whose mordant humour and irreverent approach chimes with her own. To Matthieu’s consternation, Hélène decides to visit Mister in his isolated home on the fringes of a fjord in Norway.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/21/more-than-ever-review-vicky-krieps-gaspard-ulliel-emily-atef-thoughtful-drama-about-how-to-die-well">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Epping Forest, Essex:</strong> Imagine life without mud. No mud means no worms, no birds, no badgers. Empty, lonely woods</p><p>You have probably heard the complaints: mud is icky and sticky. It’s messy. It’s everywhere. Your shoes are muddy. Look at the floor! But mud is our friend. It squelches. It slides. And all animals agree (except humans) that mud is the best.</p><p>Winter is magic. The mud is everywhere. You sink as you step. You can slide down a hill, backwards or forwards. Have you ever heard anyone shout: “It’s boring in mud”? Leaves cover the mud like a carpet. My sister and I have a favourite spot, a tree that fell many years ago in a storm. It lies in a bed of clay.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/21/young-country-diary-worship-the-mud">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The UK is full of extremely rude-sounding towns and villages. But what’s it like to live in them? Some locals can’t wait to change the names, while others embrace the quirk – even selling signpost souvenirs</p><p>On the road to Twatt, a message arrives from a resident there. Am I making the pilgrimage up through Scotland to this hamlet on the island of Orkney only to admire its notorious, unwittingly rude road sign? If so, don’t bother. “Our council was so frustrated by that sign being stolen, they have now not replaced it,” says Judith Glue, who runs a gift shop selling pictures of the old Twatt sign to tourists who might otherwise leave the region disappointed. Grateful for her warning, I thank Glue and read over a list I’ve made of those other dwelling places in the UK that through some quirk of linguistic evolution have found themselves with fantastic, filthy-sounding names. At Cock Bridge, in Aberdeenshire, they have the same trouble as in Twatt. “Our sign is constantly being pinched,” says Geva Blackett, a councillor for the region. “People have been taking them away as mementoes. Why do they do it?”</p><p>It’s an early lesson from my road trip around these towns, villages, parishes, hamlets and farms, many of which are irresistible to Insta-tourists and sign thieves – always phone ahead. One autumn day, I drive for over an hour to visit an Ass Hill in Dorset, just to find it’s an unremarkable and uninhabited lane between hedgerows. The village of Shitterton, about 20 miles away, is much more interesting. Residents here are quite accustomed to hobby-horse types like me wandering through to have a nose around and ask questions. Most are proud, even defiant about this startling name of theirs, which derives from the fact that about 1,000 years ago the site was an open sewer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jan/21/next-stop-twatt-my-tour-of-britains-fantastically-filthy-placenames">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Central heating and icy weather wreak havoc with delicate lip skin, so restorative balms and serums are invaluable</p><p>There are two types of lip balm: the pretty, flavoursome type for a quick and pleasing slick of moisture, gloss or colour; and the no-frills tube that’s deployed in the event of chapping, flaking, cracking or even bleeding.</p><p>In winter, it’s the no-frills tube that’s invaluable, since it can restore, replenish and transform lips in a few days. The hokey cokey between central heating (should you be fortunate enough to have yours turned on) and icy winds wreaks havoc, and it’s all too easy to absentmindedly lick your lips for lubrication and make matters even worse.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jan/21/battling-rough-cracked-lips-time-to-fetch-the-no-frills-big-guns">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The rise of LIV Golf presents a threat but the state of the establishment appears to vary depending on who is asked</p><p>The absence of Keith Pelley as the DP World Tour’s year got under way in Abu Dhabi this week was explained by the man himself in a note to players. “Unfortunately, the majority of my time has been, and is being, occupied in preparing for next month’s arbitration hearing,” said the chief executive of the European Tour Group.</p><p>In February, Pelley’s business will face off with LIV rebels who believe they should retain the right to play on this platform in addition to their own. Pelley said: “The hearing is also taking up a considerable amount of time for several other senior members of our staff, as well as a significant amount of financial resource, all of which in the ordinary course of things would have been more usefully deployed across our business to further benefit all our members.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/21/the-fate-of-golfs-european-tour-appears-to-be-in-the-eye-of-the-beholder">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Take midweek meals to new heights with a store-cupboard sardine curry, glossy pork with green beans, and frittata with pickled celeriac and aïoli</p><p>Delicious food needn’t be extravagant, and there are multiple ways to further your meals while still sticking to a budget. That can mean using up the tins and spices you already have in the house, rather than heading to the shops, or finding savvy swaps: tinned tuna instead of sardines, say, or chilli flakes instead of fresh chilli. Another approach that’s really effective is to take the time to try out a new cooking technique: they may seem only slight tweaks, but the effect of adding a few slivers of fried garlic, for example, or stirring lightly pickled vegetables or fresh herbs through a sauce can take a dish to wonderful new heights at little extra cost.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/21/easy-midweek-meal-recipes-yotam-ottolenghi-sardine-curry-glossy-pork-frittata-pickled-celeriac">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Based on conversations with a horse trainer, this extraordinary novel is unsentimental and humane</p><p>In her 2019 book, Aug 9 – Fog, Kathryn Scanlan cut up, edited and arranged an elderly woman’s diary found at an estate auction in a small Illinois town. The accretion of brief, broken details about food, weather, people, illness – the stuff of life – had knockout poignancy. As in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/06/the-dominant-animal-by-kathryn-scanlan-review-40-dark-and-unsentimental-tales">The Dominant Animal</a>, her collection of 40 very short stories which came out the following year, reduction and compression facilitated a largeness. Kick the Latch, Scanlan’s novel based on the experiences of Iowa-born horse trainer Sonia, is similarly expansive in the way it creates a composite portrait of a life. In a series of vignettes drawn from transcribed conversations between Scanlan and Sonia, the reader encounters dilapidated trailers, racetracks, backs of vans, long hours, brutality, beauty and joy. Sonia’s voice is unsentimental and humane, alert to absurdity and human frailty.</p><p>“Galloping, a horse spends a lot of his time suspended in the air – flying really – or on one foot. When a foot lands, there’s a thousand pounds of pressure held up by that one thin leg, that little hoof the size of a handheld ashtray,” Sonia tells us. These horses – commodities, livelihoods – need great care. Sonia has her bandages, sheet cotton, hoof packing. She soothes legs with ice, or puts the horse in a turbulator, a kind of equine jet spa. </p><p>Wendy Erskine’s latest short story collection is Dance Move (Picador).</p><p>Kick the Latch is published by Daunt (£9.99).

<p>The Inbetweeners’ Simon Bird stars in this bright, original show about a hyper-religious family. It’s such an excellent reminder of Britain’s flair for sitcoms that it’s oddly stirring</p><p>Religions famously enjoy being made fun of. That’s why [very extended paragraph deleted on legal recommendation]! Don’t we? We all do that. But I am having a lot of fun with Everyone Else Burns, the new Channel 4 comedy (Monday, 10pm) that centres on a hyper-religious family in Greater Manchester. There’s a lot to like here – the Sex Education-style 70s-tinged aesthetic, the gloopy storytelling where episodes shrug into one another, a supporting cast of absolute British comedy bangers – but the main thing is: it remembers to be funny. Again and again. And – and I hope you’re ready for a rare balancing act – never punches down at religion. And lo, there was a miracle.</p><p>Let’s start with Simon Bird, the family’s bowl-cutted patriarch. As Will in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/01/puerile-provincial-and-prophetic-how-the-inbetweeners-became-a-classic">The Inbetweeners</a> and Adam in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/nov/07/have-you-been-watching-friday-night-dinner">Friday Night Dinner</a> he was excellent but essentially played the same character, which is “Person who says: ‘What on Earth are you doing?’ whenever someone else does something odd”. Now, he’s the freak: as David, he gets his family up for punishing 2am apocalyptic fire drills, is hated by the church he loves and doesn’t understand why his wife and daughter are drifting away from him. It’s been a while – I’d probably put it around Mark from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2007/apr/16/peepshowisthebestcomedyo">Peep Show</a> – but one of comedy’s great characters is “Man who is ruining his life by his dedication to diligently following the rules”, and Bird’s David fits neatly into that fine tradition.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/21/everyone-else-burns-this-great-new-british-comedy-will-make-you-laugh-again-and-again">Continue reading...</a>

<p>She went from small-town Canada to becoming the Marilyn Monroe of the 90s – bearing the brunt of that decade’s cruel misogyny in the process. Finally the Baywatch star is ready to tell her own story</p><p>Right before Covid hit, Pamela Anderson was returning home to Canada from Marseille in the south of France. Not just any old place in Canada, but Ladysmith on Vancouver Island and the white clapboard house where she grew up. “Scene of the crime” she calls it. In France she’d been living with footballer Adil Rami for a year, but she’d had her heart broken. He wasn’t just explosively jealous, she learned, but still in a relationship with a woman with whom he had children. Just date someone normal, she thought, the spectre of former rock-star husbands Tommy Lee and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/kid-rock">Kid Rock</a> perhaps kicking doors in the back of her mind. Renovations were beginning on her new-old home and Anderson’s eye alighted on one of the contractors. Normal. A year later and 25lb heavier from their nightly beer sessions, she sat on the sofa willing – desperately willing – her fifth husband to say something interesting. “Oh boy,” she sighs now. “Normal was the worst.”</p><p>So, another divorce under her belt, Anderson swore off men and took a long, hard look at her life. She went into cupboards and attics, emptying them of memories – journals, letters, news and talkshow footage, home videotapes (as we know, she’s an inveterate taper) – and tried to map her life. What happened to that tomboy kid she once was, with the freckles and the dove-grey eyes? Why did her life seem to run in crazy chicanes around toxic relationships? Not even she could make sense of her haphazard career trajectory.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jan/21/pamela-anderson-baywatch-sex-tape-own-story">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Culture minister’s attack on two documentaries set in Palestinian territories part of campaign to silence dissent, film-makers say</p><p>Israel’s culture minister is attempting to revoke state funding from two documentary films dealing with the occupation of the Palestinian territories, increasing concerns that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/29/israel-swears-in-benjamin-netanyahu-amid-fears-of-further-slide-to-right">the country’s new hard-right government</a> will follow through on promises to crack down on dissenting voices.</p><p>The minister, Miki Zohar, of Benjamin Netanyahu’s ruling Likud party, has pledged to “revoke funding that promotes our enemy’s narrative” and withhold grants from films that “present Israeli soldiers as murderers”. He has also said he will require film-makers to sign a declaration they will not use state funds to create content that “harms the state of Israel or IDF soldiers”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/21/attack-on-freedom-israel-moves-to-claw-back-state-funds-from-critical-films">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This explosion of flavour transforms even a mundane meal into a super-tasty one</p><p>Romesco is a pungent, piquant and powerful flavour bomb that transforms even mundane meals into really tasty ones, and it’s made simply by upcycling an old pepper, tomato and piece of stale bread into a certified Catalan delicacy. My first head chef cooked mainly Spanish and Moorish-inspired food, and working with him had a profound impact on my life. It’s one reason I now love to cook colourful, rustic and flavourful food that draws on traditional cultures to create thrifty and nutritious dishes which make the most of a particular ingredient. This kind of old peasant cookery has the added benefit of supporting personal and planetary health, too.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/21/old-pepper-onion-tomato-stale-bread-spanish-sauce-romesco-recipe-zero-waste-cooking">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Russia claims to have captured village near Bakhmut; Germany declines to take decision on supplying Ukraine with tanks</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">See all our Russia-Ukraine war coverage</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Russia claimed to have captured of a village in eastern Ukraine as part of its months-long push towards the city of Bakhmut.</strong> Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said Klishchiivka, 9km south of Bakhmut, had been “liberated”. The claim could not be independently verified. Ukrainian officials made no immediate comment. Russian proxy forces in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic earlier said they had taken control of Klishchiivka.</p><p><strong>US officials have begun to nudge the Ukrainians to shift focus away from Bakhmut and focus on preparation for an offensive in the south.</strong> Joe Biden’s administration reportedly believes there is a high potential for the Russians to eventually push Ukrainian forces out of the hotly contested city, which has seen some of the war’s most intense fighting to date. Germany’s foreign intelligence service, the BND, is also reportedly alarmed by the losses the Ukrainian army is taking in Bakhmut.</p><p><strong>Gen Mark Milley, the chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, said he did not believe it was realistic to expect Ukraine to push Russian troops out of its internationally recognised territory in 2023</strong>. “From a military standpoint, I still maintain that from this year it would be very, very difficult to militarily eject Russian forces from every inch of Russian-occupied Ukraine,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2023/jan/20/us-general-it-will-be-very-difficult-to-remove-putins-forces-from-ukraine-this-year-video">he said at a press conference</a> at the Ramstein US air force base in Germany.</p><p><strong>Germany has declined to take a decision on whether to give Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine at a special international summit held at Ramstein. </strong>It had been hoped in Europe and the US that Germany would at least allow Leopards owned by countries such as Poland and Finland to be re-exported, but despite days of pleading, Berlin’s newly appointed defence minister <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/20/ukraine-germany-leopard-2-tanks-ramstein">said no final decision</a> had been taken.</p><p><strong>Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, pleaded with Germany and western allies to send their battle tanks to Kyiv at the opening of the meeting in Ramstein. </strong>Urgent action was necessary, the Ukrainian leader said, because “Russia is concentrating its forces, last forces, trying to convince everyone that hatred can be stronger than the world”.</p><p><strong>The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said the group of Kyiv-supporting defence ministers were focused on “making sure that Ukraine has the capability that it needs to be successful right now”. </strong>Speaking after the Ramstein airbase meeting, Austin described Germany as a “reliable ally”.</p><p><strong>The Kremlin said supplying additional tanks to Kyiv would not “fundamentally change anything”.</strong> Russia’s relationship with the US was at its “lowest point historically”, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov also said, with “no hope” of bilateral relations improving “in the foreseeable future”.</p><p><strong>A former US navy Seal has been killed in Ukraine, American officials said on Friday.</strong> Daniel W Swift, a 1st class petty officer who deserted his post in San Diego in March 2019, was injured in Dnipro and died of his wounds on Wednesday. Officials said he was not fighting in an official capacity. The navy said it “cannot speculate as to why the former sailor was in Ukraine”.</p><p><strong>EU countries are reportedly working on a 10th round of Russia-related sanctions. </strong>The next package of sanctions “will be somewhere around” the anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, one senior diplomat told Reuters. EU officials are also seeking approval from the ministers for a seventh tranche of military aid for Ukraine worth €500m.</p><p><strong>The US will impose additional sanctions against the Wagner Group,</strong> the White House national security council spokesperson, John Kirby, has said. The US treasury department plans to designate Wagner as a significant transnational criminal organisation, which would freeze any assets the group has in the US and prohibit Americans from providing Wagner with funds, goods or services.</p><p><strong>Italian authorities are on the hunt for a Russian oligarch after two of his luxury yachts that were seized under EU sanctions mysteriously disappeared from a port in Sardinia. </strong>The yachts, belonging to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/20/italy-seeks-dmitry-mazepin-russian-oligarch-seized-yachts-disappeared-sardinia">Dmitry Mazepin, the billionaire owner </a>of a mineral fertiliser company, went missing from the Sardinian port of Olbia within weeks of each other last summer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/21/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-332-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Sundance film festival:</strong> Phoebe Dynevor and Alden Ehrenreich give top-tier performances in a juicy crowd-pleaser about a couple competing at the same workplace</p><p>In the first scene of the punchy Sundance thriller Fair Play, a New York couple, Luke (Alden Ehrenreich) and Emily (the Bridgerton breakout Phoebe Dynevor), are covered in blood. They’re at his brother’s wedding and are so desperately in heat for one another that they soon find themselves in the bathroom, him performing oral sex before group photos are taken. But Emily is on her period and between cleaning themselves off and laughing at the unfortunate timing, a ring falls out of Luke’s pocket and suddenly they’re engaged. A marriage forged in blood.</p><p>It’s no real spoiler to say that it’s a nasty omen of what’s to come, the writer-director Chloe Domont’s ruthless, and ruthlessly entertaining, feature debut taking a happy young couple and throwing them into chaos. There’s something darkly gratifying about that formula, one we haven’t seen as much of recently but that dominated the 80s and 90s. While there’s a definite throwback vibe to Fair Play, Domont isn’t interested in merely repeating what’s come before.</p><p>Fair Play premiered at the Sundance film festival and is seeking distribution</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/20/fair-play-review-knockout-thriller-pits-a-couple-against-each-other">Continue reading...</a>
