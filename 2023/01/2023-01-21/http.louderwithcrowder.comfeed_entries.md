<p>Lightfoot's comments came during a mayoral debate with eight other candidates. When asked about her solutions to combat crime in Chicago, the sixth-most dangerous city in America, Lightfoot said: <em>"I heard a lot of rhetoric here, a lot of soundbites, but not a lot of concrete solutions on how we get the job done and make our residents and our workers safe. We’re doing it every single day. We have been in Little Village working with those street vendors, understanding what the nature of the crime is, making sure that we’re doing things in concert with them to help them, to make sure that their money is secure. Not use money, if at all possible, using other forms of transactions to carry themselves.”</em></p><p>In Little Village, robberies increased by 13% in 2022 compared to 2021. So far in 2023, robberies are already up by 114% compared to the same time last year. </p><p>Last year, several major corporations closed their Chicago-area offices, <a href="https://abc7chicago.com/big-companies-in-chicago-leaving-news-jobs/12303608/#:~:text=Tyson%20Foods%2C%20Boeing%2C%20Caterpillar%20and,several%20big%20companies%20leaving%20Chicago." target="_blank">including</a> Tyson Foods, Boeing, Citadel, and Caterpillar. While not specifically citing crime, it's pretty clear the city is dying, and the departure of these big-name companies certainly doesn't help.</p><p>McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski criticized Chicago's crime, saying, "We have violent crime that's happening in our restaurants ... we're seeing homelessness issues in our restaurants. We're having drug overdoses that are happening in our restaurants. So we see in our restaurants, every single day, what's happening in society at large."</p><p>He also said it's very difficult to recruit people for McDonald's Chicago headquarters since people are scared to travel downtown. But have they considered never carrying any cash? No? Problem solved. </p><p><p>

## 64-Year-Old Madonna makes another pathetic attempt to remain relevant with blasphemous Vanity Fair photoshoot

The 64-year-old superstar keeps acting out for attention in increasingly outlandish ways. First, she <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/madonna-tonight-show-jimmy-fallon" target="_blank">flashed</a> her nearly-70-year old booty on the "Tonight Show" for some inexplicable reason. Then, she made an <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/madonna-drops-new-nft-bleach" target="_blank">NFT</a> of her nearly 70-year-old vagina, and was <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/madonna-instagram-livstream" target="_blank">confused</a> when it got her banned from live-streaming for community guidelines violations. After that, she <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/madonna-tiktok-out" target="_blank">randomly</a> announced she was gay, which no one needed to know. No one wants that mental image. <em>*Shudder*</em></p><p>In her latest attempt to remain relevant and edgy, the pop star decided to do a blasphemous "Icon Issue" for Vanity Fair. Given her advancing age...not sure how this will pan out for her in the long run. </p><p>Here she is depicted as Our Lady of Sorrows, the image of the Blessed Virgin Mary weeping over the seven sorrows of her and Jesus' life. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cThank You @VanityFair! \u271d\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9c\nOut Now\n#luigiandiango\u201d</div> — Madonna (@Madonna)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/Madonna/status/1616141626300157952">1674153164</a>
</blockquote>
<p>She also posed as Jesus in the Last Supper, surrounded by a group of women intended to be the Apostles. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cNew Madonna Vanity Fair photo shoot. These people and that whole industry is utterly demonic.\u201d</div> — Paul Joseph Watson (@Paul Joseph Watson)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/PrisonPlanet/status/1616371852959531008">1674208055</a>
</blockquote>
<p>Madonna defended the image of herself as the Virgin Mary in her interview with <a href="https://www-vanityfair-it.translate.goog/article/madonna-intervista-icon-issue?_x_tr_sl=it&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=sc" target="_blank">Vanity Fair</a>, saying, "Look closely at the image: I am there with a crown on my head, in a sumptuous dress, above an altar. Do you know how I felt? I felt exposed, attacked. And it was just a metaphor, it was just a set. That image brought me back to Rome, when I was fiercely criticized by the Catholic Church." </p><p>Madonna has been criticized by the Catholic Church, and for good reason. In 2006, Madonna, who was raised Catholic, performed a mock crucifixion during her "Confessions" tour. In 2008, Madonna dedicated her performance of "Like a Virgin" in Rome to the Pope, saying "I dedicate this song to the Pope, because I’m a child of God." The Vatican had already condemned her music video for the song, which featured burning crosses, statues crying blood, and Madonna seducing a black Jesus.</p><p>It might be time for Madonna to retire or go on vacation- y'know, like all millionaire 64-year-olds do. Just maybe pump the brakes on the blasphemy. And for the love of all things holy, please no more vagina NFT's. </p><p><p>

## Watch as Mike Rowe destroys billionaire elites who blame the middle class for 'all the trouble in the world'

Rowe joined Laura Ingraham last night and WENT OFF on all of them.</p><p>Not WENT OFF in the way you or I would. He went off in his own Mike Rowe way. He's very mild-mannered in his going off.

## Watch: NFL Legend Tony Dungy defies media haters, addresses March for Life about the power of prayer

	Yesterday marked the first March for Life since the Supreme Court ruled on the right side of history and overturned Roe v Wade. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/search/?q=roe+v+wade" target="_blank">You might have noticed a leftist meltdown or five on the matter</a>. One "controversial" speaker at this year's march was NFL legend and NFL Sports analyst Tony Dungy.
</p><p>
	I use sarcastic finger quotes around the word "controversial" because the only controversy is Dungy having an opinion contrary to every other leftist media member. They've been <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tony-dungy-right-to-life" target="_blank">lashing out about it</a>. Dungy spoke at the rally anyway with a "bless their hearts" for his haters. That's a proper, Christian way to say "cry about deez nuts, losers."
</p><p>
	Bless their hearts was what he was thinking. With his words, he talked about the power of prayer.
</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
		Those that advocate for a “right to choose” lose their minds when people choose life.<br />
<br />
		There is only ONE choice when it comes to Pro-Choice. 💀<br />
<br />
		Tony Dungy understands this. He stands on his biblical principles and advocates for all life. 🙏<br />

</blockquote></div><blockquote>A young man by the name of Damar Hamlin of the Buffalo Bills made a routine tackle and his heart stopped beating right on the field. It could have been tragic, but something miraculous happened. The team medical staff rushed out and got Damar’s heart started again. But you know what? That wasn’t the miracle. The real miracle was the reaction of everyone to that. The announcers on the broadcast, what did they say? ‘All we can do is pray. All across the country, people started praying.</blockquote><p>Hamlin is out of the hospital. Where he will hopefully be front and center at this Sunday's Bills vs Bengals game and do nothing but stare at Tee Higgins to make him uncomfortable. Go Bills!</p><p>Making a big deal about openly praying over this one football player ties into the outrage over Dungy speaking at the march, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nhl-network-analyst-lashes-out" target="_blank">or that one hockey player who didn't want to wear a shirt</a>. Woke media, which is most media, freaks out over anyone who has the slightest opposing viewpoint than them. It's worse in sports media, where reporters are barely interested in sports as much as they are in promoting their progressive worldview.</p><p>That's why it stands out when <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/espn-prayer-damar-hamlin" target="_blank">one sole ESPN personality leads an on-air prayer</a>. Or <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/josh-allen-bills-god-real" target="_blank">the greatest quarterback currently playing the game</a> does. So few have the courage to say the word prayer in fear the left is going to lash out them being homophobes who hate women, puppies, and ice cream.</p><p>These rare moments stand out because they are rare. They're still cultural wins. We need to amplify those who have the courage to speak out, take the wins where we get them, and build on them.</p><p><p>
