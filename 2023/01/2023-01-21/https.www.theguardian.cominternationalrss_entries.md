Since Romain Perraud’s late non-consolation for Southampton in a 4-1 defeat at St Mary’s, Pope has gone 721 minutes without being beaten. That’s 12 hours and one minute – enough time to watch an entire season of Succession, or listen to side one of a Flaming Lips album.</p><p>Right here, right now, Newcastle have the best defence in the Premier League. It’s quite an achievement – and quite a change in identity for a club whose previous Premier League success, under Kevin Keegan and Sir Bobby Robson, involved scoring as many goals as possible and the hell with clean sheets.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2023/jan/21/crystal-palace-v-newcastle-premier-league-live-score-updates">Continue reading...</a>

## Nick David sinks Sharks to seal Champions Cup progress for Harlequins

<ul><li>Pool A: Harlequins 39-29 Sharks</li><li>David scores standout try in much-needed victory</li></ul><p>Harlequins secured their place in the Champions Cup knockout stages in considerable style, chalking up their first victory of 2023 with an impressive show of attacking firepower. Nick David was the standout performer against the Sharks, scoring the pick of Harlequins’ five tries – and setting up two others – in what was, if nothing else, a demonstration of what this side can do if the rain stays off.</p><p>Danny Care, making his 350th appearance, also got on the scoresheet, as did the England hopefuls Alex Dombrandt and Cadan Murley as well as Stephan Lewies. It was a win that Harlequins needed, having not prevailed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/18/harlequins-racing-92-champions-cup-rugby-union-match-report">since Racing 92 were the visitors</a> on 18 December. It is no mean feat to progress with 12 points after double headers with the Sharks and Racing and even if they seem to lack the forward might that tends to be required at the business end of the campaign, they will cause their opponents problems in the last 16 on this evidence.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/21/harlequins-sharks-champions-cup-rugby-union-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

The salad and potatoes make it a more substantial spread, and are two elevated side dishes to have up your sleeve for when you’re having friends round – both would be equally great with a lemony roast chicken. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/21/how-to-turn-a-cheeseboard-into-a-meal-recipe-rosie-birkett">Continue reading...</a>
