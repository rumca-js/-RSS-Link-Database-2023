The\nsmaller the board the shorter the game, and when you're new playing\nlots of games quickly is better for learning and keeping it fun.  I\nalso like that on smaller boards you're more able to substitute\nreasoning for go-specific intuition, giving a better learning curve.\n\n</span>\n\n<p>\n\nYou can make a small go board by blocking off the corner of a larger\none, with rubber bands or pieces of cardboard, or you can sketch one\non paper, but this is not very satisfying.  Unfortunately, no one\nseems to sell very small boards: you can buy <a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/Yellow-Mountain-Imports-Playing-Single/dp/B00EK7UIY2\">9x9</a>\n<a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/RNK-Gaming-Beginners-Reversible-Melamine/dp/B08TQGFV65\">boards</a>\nbut not 7x7 or 5x5.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI made a 5x5 board <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/5x5-go-board\">a year ago</a>, and it\nhas gotten a lot of use, so I decided to make a few more.  This time I\nwanted to make enough that I can keep at least one at my dad's house\nand one at the office in addition to one for home.  So:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/lots-of-small-go-boards-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/lots-of-small-go-boards.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe process was similar to last time.  I started by cutting <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/pantry-staples-for-diy\">3/4\"</a> plywood into rectangles.\nBut how big?\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe cells on a Go board aren't squares: they're traditionally ~7%\ntaller then they're wide.  Possibly this is to adjust for perspective\nwhen you look down on the board at an angle?  You normally space the\nlines 7/8\" horizontally and 15/16\" vertically, and ideally leave that\nmuch for a margin as well, though it could be as small as 1/4\" if you\nhad to.  This gives us:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th colspan=\"2\">5x5</th>\n<th colspan=\"2\">7x7</th>\n<th colspan=\"2\">9x9\n</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Min  </th>\n<td>4\"</td>\n<td>4 1/4\"</td>\n<td>5 3/4\"</td>\n<td>6 1/8\"</td>\n<td>7 1/2\"</td>\n<td>8\"\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Ideal</th>\n<td>5 1/4\"</td>\n<td>5 5/8\"</td>\n<td>7\"</td>\n<td>7 1/2\"</td>\n<td>8 3/4\"</td>\n<td>9 3/8\"\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nIt's also fine if they're bigger than what I've called \"ideal\", if you\nlike a larger margin.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIn looking through wood scraps some were a bit smaller than the ideal\nsize, but as long as I didn't go below the minimum size I knew the\ngrid would fit.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI cut each piece to be square, and then sanded them smooth.  Here's\nthe process of gridding a 7x7:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/7x7-go-board-blank-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"391\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/7x7-go-board-blank.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI started by finding the midpoint:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/7x7-go-board-one-line-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/7x7-go-board-one-line.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/7x7-go-board-two-lines-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/7x7-go-board-two-lines.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI marked off ticks at 7/8 and 15/16 from the center:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/7x7-go-board-initial-ticks-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"420\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/7x7-go-board-initial-ticks.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nMore ticks for the perimeter:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/7x7-go-board-more-ticks-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"444\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/7x7-go-board-more-ticks.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nDrawing in the whole grid with a straight edge:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/7x7-go-board-full-grid-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"443\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/7x7-go-board-full-grid.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nStarting to ink the lines.  You need to be careful to offset the\nstraight edge from your target line because the marker doesn't draw\nexactly along the straight edge:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/7x7-go-board-beginning-inking-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/7x7-go-board-beginning-inking.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nInked the rest of the lines:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/7x7-go-board-done-inking-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"419\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/7x7-go-board-done-inking.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nErases the pencil marks:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/7x7-go-board-erased-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"415\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/7x7-go-board-erased.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThere's a little mark where I accidentally touched the marker.  I\nremoved it later by sanding the spot, though there's a tiny dent now.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nHere are all the boards, ready for polyurethane.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/lots-of-go-boards-ready-for-poly-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/lots-of-go-boards-ready-for-poly.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nAnd after three coats of poly, protected and shiny:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/lots-of-small-go-boards-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/lots-of-small-go-boards.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n\nI'm tempted to list these on Etsy, not because I want to be making\nthem to sell but in the hope someone will try to \"rip me off\" and\nthen people will be able to get 5x5 and 7x7 boards commercially.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid0QxZrsEifFCz8z2MTTQZE4wXn7LVEDxtrygkEx8zQAfaS8k3dk5c5n9aPpUjSs339l\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/109727727952188221\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}], "source": {"url": "https://www.jefftk.com/news.rss", "title": "Jeff Kaufmann"}}
