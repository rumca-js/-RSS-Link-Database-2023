I think that discussion is interesting to\nreview now that we can see how it worked out, and is probably more\ninteresting than continuing with this post below where I look at minor\nwording changes.\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nBut, if you want to stick around for my looking through the <a href=\"https://archive.org/\">Internet Archive</a> for minor wording\nchanges, here are the five versions it captured on the site.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n\nThe first one is <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110726123337/http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/our-pledge/index.php\">2011-07-26</a>,\nwith:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\nI recognise that I can use part of my income to do a significant\namount of good in the developing world. Since I can live well enough\non a smaller income, I pledge that from today until the day I retire,\nI shall give at least ten percent of what I earn to whichever\norganizations can most effectively use it to fight poverty in\ndeveloping countries. I make this pledge freely, openly, and without\nregret.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nSometime between <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140208030748/http://givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/the-pledge\">2014-02-08</a>\nand <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140603024731/https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge\">2014-06-03</a>\nthe pledge was changed to:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\nI recognise that I can use part of my income to do a significant\namount of good in the developing world. Since I can live well enough\non a smaller income, I pledge that for the rest of my life or until\nthe day I retire, I shall give at least ten percent of what I earn to\nwhichever organisations can most effectively use it to help people in\ndeveloping countries, now and in the years to come. I make this pledge\nfreely, openly, and sincerely.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nThis expansion brought in things like interventions that save lives\nwithout necessarily making people less poor, interventions that take a\nwhile to pay off, and even <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/9Xp7BGoKnbSiP3Ng8/should-giving-what-we-can-change-its-pledge?commentId=MNQFhGsgPQvXSWM7i\">reducing\nexistential risk</a> (provided that you think it's still worth it when\nonly including the benefit to people in developing counties).  I can't\nfind any discussion of this at the time, but if there was please\npoint me to it!\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe big change was a few months later, sometime between <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20141127052745/https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge\">2014-11-27</a>\nand <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150107070427/https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge\">2015-01-07</a>,\nwhen they changed it to:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\nI recognise that I can use part of my income to do a significant\namount of good. Since I can live well enough on a smaller income, I\npledge that for the rest of my life or until the day I retire, I shall\ngive at least ten percent of what I earn to whichever organisations\ncan most effectively use it to improve the lives of others, now and in\nthe years to come. I make this pledge freely, openly, and sincerely.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nExpanding the pledge to be cause netural was <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/9Xp7BGoKnbSiP3Ng8/should-giving-what-we-can-change-its-pledge\">very\ncontroversial</a>: people were worried it would dilute what GWWC stood\nfor, and hurt its credibility.  On the other hand, there's a lot of\nvalue in having a pledge we can all stand behind, plus encouraging\npeople to make a lifetime committment to a specific cause is contrary\nto a lot of what EA stands for.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nChanges since then have been pretty minor.  Between <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200907105108/https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge/\">2020-09-07</a>\nand <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200919180352/https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge/\">2020-09-19</a>\nit gained some blanks for expiration and amount:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\nI recognise that I can use part of my income to do a significant\namount of good. Since I can live well enough on a smaller income, I\npledge that from now until __ I shall give __ to whichever\norganisations can most effectively use it to improve the lives of\nothers, now and in the years to come. I make this pledge freely,\nopenly, and sincerely.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nAsking GWWC, they said this was to allow one version of the main text\nto cover what had previously required <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/trial-pledge\">other</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/further-pledge\">variants</a>.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nLater, between <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220208085033/https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge/\">2022-02-08</a>\nand <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220213084231/https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge/\">2022-02-13</a>\nit gained one last blank, for the start date:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\nI recognise that I can use part of my income to do a significant\namount of good. Since I can live well enough on a smaller income, I\npledge that from __ until __ I shall give __ to whichever\norganisations can most effectively use it to improve the lives of\nothers, now and in the years to come. I make this pledge freely,\nopenly, and sincerely.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nAsking GWWC again, this was to cover both cases where someone was\nintending to start on a future date, and also cases where people\nwanted to pick a date in the past so the pledge would cover earlier\nincome.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<br />\n\n<i>Disclosure: <a href=\"https://juliawise.net/\">my wife</a> used to be\nPresident of GWWC, but I haven't run this post by her and I don't know\nher views here.
