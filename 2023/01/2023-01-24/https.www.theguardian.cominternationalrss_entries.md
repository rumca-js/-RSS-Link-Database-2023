<p>A parliamentary committee made some pretty benign recommendations, only for ministers to nope it all. Their approach is like a devilish trolling operation</p><p>I feel as if it’s quite unusual for a parliamentary committee to have <em>all </em>its suggestions rejected by the government, but maybe I’m doing my sums in old money. Last summer, the women and equalities committee made a number of recommendations around menopause support. None of it sounded that major: no mandatory high-voltage air-conditioning units in public venues, no blanket rules on when to, and when not to, bother a menopausal woman with your nonsense, nothing like that. Just some basic workplace support from larger employers – specific menopause leave, more flexibility on sickness policy, a move to make the menopause a protected characteristic, so that there would be a statutory duty to make reasonable adjustments for it.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/24/menopause-law-equalities-act-uk-change-rejected">This week, ministers noped all of it</a>, except to agree “in principle” to a public awareness campaign, a move weak and pointless in the abstract, and teeth-grindingly asinine when you imagine what that campaign would look like. Babyish fonts on a pink background, some 27-year-old-comms-professional-devised slogan telling you it’s OK not to feel OK. It’s like some devilish trolling operation: these menopausal women <em>say </em>they’re so angry they could set fire to furniture using only their white-hot eyeballs.

Despite losing to Rennes and Lens in recent weeks, and having looked unsteady at times in the Champions League, the team, and Kylian Mbappé in particular, won their Coupe de France match 7-0 this weekend, offering a firm riposte to anyone who thought their hegemony in France will be broken this season.</p><p>Of course, scoring seven goals against Pays de Cassel, a sixth-tier side who featured a baker in goal, will not impress everyone. But PSG had a raft of absentees for this last-32 tie, including Marco Verratti, Lionel Messi and Gianluigi Donnarumma. Achraf Hakimi was only on the bench for the visitors, and Renato Sanches and Nuno Mendes were making their first starts in some while, having also struggled with injury this season.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/24/psg-7-0-win-coupe-de-france-kylian-mbappe-rennes-lens-goals">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The football analyst has consistently leveraged his ample platform and gravitas against reproductive rights and LGBTQ people – and it doesn’t seem like NBC or the NFL care</p><p>No sports league does more than the National Football League to encourage the stereotype of the glass-chewing, expletive-spewing coach. Tony Dungy, though, was more <a href="https://30rock.fandom.com/wiki/Kenneth_Parcell">Kenneth Parcell</a> than Bill Parcells – a soft-spoken, clean-cut ex-defensive back whose winning pedigree and strategic ingenuity rightly earned him pride of place among the titans of his profession. That Dungy is also a Black pioneer makes him especially useful to commissioner Roger Goodell’s efforts to “protect the [NFL] shield” from the seasonal assaults on its undying legacy of racial and gender inequality. Since transitioning to a lofty post-retirement role as co-host of NBC’s top-rated NFL telecasts, it’s been on the 67-year-old to serve up even-toned reassurances of the league’s commitment to fair play. But when it comes to Dungy’s personal views, the coach will happily talk tough.</p><p>Last Friday, Washington DC’s National Mall was the site of the March for Life, a pro-life rally that kicked off in 1974 – a year after Roe v Wade was decided. Interestingly, the rally was conceived by anti-abortionists on the left – first as a one off, then as a protest that would annually recur until Roe v Wade was overturned. But it’s long since been taken over by the right and turned into a political football. In 2020 Donald Trump became the first sitting president to attend the event in person. Dungy’s maiden appearance for the 50th edition of the March, the first since Roe was overturned, was no less noteworthy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/24/tony-dungy-controversial-tweet-abortion-right-wing-politics">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A chance meeting between two jilted strangers leads to chaotic imposture and a vinyl rescue mission in this freewheeling feature debut from director Raine Allen Miller</p><p>Feature first-timer Raine Allen Miller directs this romcom urban-pastoral, goofing and freewheeling around the streets of south London with an almost childlike innocence – shot by Olan Collardy in rich colour with cartoony wide-angle streetscapes, and scripted by Nathan Bryon and Tom Melia. Unsubtle and on-the-nose though it undoubtedly is, there is also an amiable, upbeat energy.</p><p>It benefits from two sympathetic leads: Vivian Oparah (from BBC TV’s Dr Who spin-off Class) and David Jonsson. Oparah plays Yas, a wannabe fashion designer, waiting for people to call her back for interviews for jobs. She finds herself in the gender-neutral lavatories at a photography exhibition and overhears recently heartbroken Dom (Jonsson) sobbing in one of the stalls; Dom’s humiliation is then complete when Yas asks him tentatively through the door if he’s OK, then has to tell him that this toilet is not, as he assumed, the “gents”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/24/rye-lane-review-engagingly-cartoony-romcom-on-the-streets-of-south-london">Continue reading...</a>

<ul><li>Pakistan 118; Australia 119-2 | Australia win by eight wickets</li><li>Schutt takes five wickets while Perry hits unbeaten 57 </li></ul><p>Australia’s women simply love playing T20 cricket at North Sydney Oval. Heading into the first of three matches against Pakistan, they had won all nine short-form internationals they had previously played at the picture-postcard ground. And under clear blue skies on Tuesday, the reigning world champions in this format were in no mood for that impressive run to end.</p><p>Having restricted Pakistan to 118 – a subpar total considering the quality of the wicket and the boutique ground’s short boundaries – the home side made short work of the modest run chase, knocking off the required runs with more than six overs to spare. The convincing eight-wicket victory makes it 10 on the trot at North Sydney.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/24/ellyse-perry-delivers-with-bat-and-ball-as-australia-ease-to-t20-win-over-pakistan">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Marketers have shifted their focus from millennial pink – but they’re trying to reach an audience skeptical of such ploys</p><p>Instagram-famous skincare packaging, designer runways, and red carpet gowns have moved on from millennial pink, the hue that captivated and coddled “girlbosses” through the late 2010s. Instead, make way for Gen Z yellow. But can a generation famous for its fractured individualism really unite behind the color of caution tape?</p><p>Gen Z yellow is similar to one of Pantone’s Colors of the Year for 2021, “illuminating,” a dose of canary meant to herald brighter, post-pandemic days. So it makes sense spring 2023 runways such as Alexander McQueen and Moschino featured the color. (Although the history of Gen Z yellow goes all the way back to 2017, when the writer Haley Nahman <a href="https://repeller.com/yellow-is-trending/">coined it</a> in an essay on the now defunct blog Man Repeller.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jan/23/gen-z-yellow-fashion-millennial-pink">Continue reading...</a>
