Richardson was filming herself just before takeoff and claimed a flight attendant "disrespected her" by...asking her to turn off her phone. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>
<p>Richardson also claimed the flight attendant "jumped in her video" and "invaded her privacy," suggesting this could make him lose his job. Not sure that's how that works, but ok. <br /></p><p>In one of her posts, Richardson explained, "Prior to the video this gentleman asked me to get off a cell phone call, I did. I stated to him I didn’t like the tone he used with me. Following that while standing in front of me doing the safety protocols he continued to lean over to look at my phone. He asked to see that my phones were in airplane more at this point. He demanded that me show him. Which I did in front of him.”</p><p>After the flight attendant asked her to stop recording, and she refused, she claimed the attendant was "harassing her." </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>
<p>She said many of the passengers were "disrespecting" her as well, with one saying he was going to miss his connection because of her. Richardson responded, "Oh, so you’re worried about a connection when a grown man is disrespecting me?" And this absolute legend looked her in the eyes and responded, "I don’t give a s–t." </p><p>Not all heroes wear capes. Some are disgruntled American Airlines passengers. </p><p>Richardson wrote on Instagram she's considering legal action. She also complained about the "disrespect" from the passengers who applauded her removal from the plane, who she referred to as "regular" people, while she's a "superstar." No, seriously. She really said that. Pain. </p><p>As to the possible legal action, I'm not sure what grounds Richardson would have.  But I'm gonna take a wild guess and say it would have something to do with "disrespect." Just a hunch. </p><p><p>

<p>Now the context. It's a clip from a new video by former professor <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/professor-college-untethered-reality" target="_blank">Peter Boghossian</a>.

Our young hero gets even more based in the extended clip.</p><blockquote>If we were to be ruled by Russia, they are a communist country. And I know by history it wasn't really good.

## 'She says she's a woman!' CBS News desperately tries to defend transwoman in YMCA locker room

So as not to <em>offend</em> anyone. Besides the 17-year-old girl. She'll be fine. Maybe. </p><p>Rebecca Phillips, the 17-year-old at the center of this story, went viral after she <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMALHk-i7wc" target="_blank">spoke</a> to City Council about her slight problem with showering with such women who happen to have penises. When she asked the YMCA if this is allowed, management confirmed that, ahem, "beautiful women," are, in fact, allowed to shower with young girls at the YMCA. Unless they're a sex offender, of course. That would just be absurd. </p><p>CBS tracked down the trans-woman in question, 66-year-old Christynne Lili Wrene Wood, and asked, er, "her" about the controversy. Wood announced plans to speak at an upcoming city council meeting. </p><p>Despite apparent threats of violence, Wood, a Navy veteran, explained, "I know how to give an insult out, I know what areas to kick and punch, you know, at least enough to be able to run until I can get to my car and get out of here." </p><p>But the best part of the interview comes later when one of the reporters attempts to explain to his colleague why Wood is in the right. The reporter blabbers, "She says she's a woman and she really wants to drive home the fact that she transitioned over 5 years ago. And that, you know, she — she's — she's a woman & — & she says she’s a woman."</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>You can see his gears spinning as he tries to make the 66-year-old woman who happens to have a penis and wants to shower with a 17-year-old girl the good guy in this scenario. I don't envy his position--that's a tough one to spin. But she says she's a woman, so... case closed...I guess. </p><p><p>

## Latest dumb reason the left hates Ron DeSantis drops: he thinks kids shouldn't have cell phones in class

He believes that teachers <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-woke-media-corporation" target="_blank">shouldn't be sexualizing eight-year-olds</a> in class. He believes if you take an AP History class, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-history-class" target="_blank">it should teach actual history</a>. But with these new bars from DeSantis, I think he might be a menace. And this is coming from LwC's resident "DeSimp," as marks for his main GOP rival like to call me.</p><p>Ron DeSantis, the Governor of Florida, and who some call the Governor of America, now says teachers should be allowed to confiscate kids' cell phones while they are in class.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) says “a school district would be totally within their rights” to confiscate students' cellphones during classes. <a href="https://t.co/F8OEEWyzNh">pic.twitter.com/F8OEEWyzNh</a><br />— The Recount (@therecount) <a href="https://twitter.com/therecount/status/1617548005686525954?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 23, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>I think to myself, "Why are these kids on their phones during class all the time?" I think a school district would be totally in their rights to say, "you know what, leave your phone in some cubby or something." Go sit in class. LEARN. Then if you want to get in during recess and text people, fine. But they should not be always on their phones being distracted from the lessons. So I think that our school board will be able to lean in on some stuff too to buttress what were' doing."</blockquote><p>LOL. He said BUTTress. </p><p>Also...</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="4989d" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32896643&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Ron DeSantis is literally dangerous in every literal way. Truly, and literally, an authoritarian personality. Just ask Becky from MSNBC.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">He is so dangerous in every way. Truly an authoritarian personality <a href="https://t.co/SrRFfjdJRw">https://t.co/SrRFfjdJRw</a><br />— Ruth Ben-Ghiat (@ruthbenghiat) <a href="https://twitter.com/ruthbenghiat/status/1617747804910399488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 24, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>What I find to be the most amusing about this is if there would be one group of people in full support of DeSantis's new "Don't Say iPhone" agenda, it would be teachers. If WOULD be teachers, if their unions allowed them to express their own opinions outside of ones approved by Democrats.  </p><p>But anyone who knows a kid knows when they get on their phones they no longer pay attention to what's around them. The only people who don't seem to realize this is the kids' parents... who when they get on their phones and no longer pay attention to what's around them. Or their children. Who are on their phones.</p><p>It's a vicious cycle. Ron DeSantis is right about this.</p><p><p>

## Doocy nails KJP with hilarious question: What four-letter word did you use when FBI caught Biden with more classified docs?

We can always count on him to brighten the dismal White House Briefing room - even when the border is wide open, the President is completely senile, and there's not an <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/egg-prices-mexico" target="_blank">egg</a> to be found. </p><p>Yesterday, Doocy asked Karine-Jean Pierre which "four-letter word" she used when she found out the FBI found MORE classified documents at Biden's Wilmington home, and even KJP couldn't resist laughing:<br /></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cDOOCY TO KJP: \u201cWhen you found out that the FBI located even more Classified Materials in Wilmington, which four letter word did you use?\u201d\u201d</div> — ALX \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@ALX \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/alx/status/1617630126170308608">1674508050</a>
</blockquote>
<p>Other reporters were less jovial with poor Karine Jean-Pierre. One asked her why Americans should believe Biden takes classified material seriously. KJP responded, "He says 'I take this very seriously.'" </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cQ: "Why should the American people believe that this president takes classified material seriously?"\n\nKarine Jean-Pierre: "He says I take this very seriously."\u201d</div> — RNC Research (@RNC Research)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/RNCResearch/status/1617617342761996294">1674505003</a>
</blockquote>
<p>Another reporter asked her why Biden has "no regrets" with his handling of the classified documents. KJP initially couldn't come up with an answer, then said it "speaks for itself." But it doesn't, though. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201c"Why doesn't [Biden] have regrets given classified documents keep turning up?"\n\nKarine Jean-Pierre: "It speaks for itself."\u201d</div> — RNC Research (@RNC Research)

</blockquote>
<p>She's really out here struggling to twist the narrative. Perhaps our old pal Jen Psaki could give her some pointers on deception. She really had it down pat. <br /></p><p>The newest tranche of classified documents was uncovered during a 13-hour consensual search of Biden's home. This is the fourth time documents have been found since the initial discovery last November, which wasn't made public until January, of course. Nothing to see there, not like there was an <em>election</em> or anythi- oh...<br /></p><p>Anyway, the newest discovery featured six classified documents. Some reportedly dated from Biden's time as a Senator, between 1973 and 2009. Other were from his time as Vice President, from 2013 to 2017. The FBI reportedly also seized some notes Biden had handwritten as Vice President. </p><p>The House Oversight Committee has since <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/politics/house-oversight-committee-demands-wilmington-visitor-logs-from-secret-service" target="_blank">requested</a> visitor logs from the Wilmington home since it would be important to know who could have wandered into the garage and stumbled across sensitive information crucial to the security of our country.</p><p> It was originally reported there were no visitor logs at all. But the Secret Service does background checks on <em>some</em> people who visit the house, meaning there should be at least a partial list. But with this administration, I wouldn't count on it. </p><p><p>

## Watch: Gavin Newsom cries gun rights are a 'suicide pact,' then a reporter hits him with an inconvenient fact

You won't hear about them much. The gunman doesn't fit the media's preferred profile: white, male, wearing a red MAGA cap and a "Tucker Carlson is My Homeboy" shirt. Plus the victims were <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/asian-hate-nyc" target="_blank">Asian</a>, and if the gunman doesn't fit that profile the left and the media (but I repeat myself) <a href="https://youtu.be/bFFfCZJ6gbw" target="_blank">no longer care about stopping Asian hate</a>.</p><p>But it's California and a gun went off, so it gives Governor Gavin Newsom and excuses to politicize it while he still can. His new thing is to call the Second Amendment a "suicide pact." He has the freedom to say so under the First Amendment. And also because he was surrounded by armed guards armed with guns.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">“The second amendment is a suicide pact,” <a href="https://twitter.com/GavinNewsom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GavinNewsom</a> tells us tonight on the <a href="https://twitter.com/CBSEveningNews?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CBSEveningNews</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MontereyPark?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MontereyPark</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GovernorNewsom?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GovernorNewsom</a> <a href="https://t.co/I5kyx9O1AU">pic.twitter.com/I5kyx9O1AU</a><br />— Norah O'Donnell 🇺🇸 (@NorahODonnell) <a href="https://twitter.com/NorahODonnell/status/1617700352522088454?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 24, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Norah O'Donnell then, in a rather surprising fashion, pushed back gently on Newsom's anti-gun rhetoric. "But there's many people in this country that support the second amendment and are lawful gun owners."</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">After California Governor Newsome called the Second Amendment a "suicide pact", CBS's Norah O'Donnell actually pushes back on him:<br /><br /> "But there's many people in this country that support the second amendment and are lawful gun owners." <a href="https://t.co/pqUTmj7zG7">pic.twitter.com/pqUTmj7zG7</a><br />— Kevin Tober (@KevinTober94) <a href="https://twitter.com/KevinTober94/status/1617670501488271362?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 23, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Newsom was forced to clarify. He was also shocked because this was CBS News and he was expecting them to smile and nod. The California governor claims he has “no ideological opposition” against people who he deems “responsible” and who own guns, get a background check, and are trained to use them. Newsom just believes the document that grants them the God-given right to do so is a suicide pact.</p><p>Much like every time Joe Biden <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-guns" target="_blank">opens his facehole</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-guns-glock" target="_blank">ignorant things</a> about <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-coming-guns-2019" target="_blank">guns shoot out</a>, Newsom's comments are why law-abiding gun owners don't trust any politician who wants to put an asterisk next to the words "shall not be infringed." If we aren't vigilant, they'll do away with the entire document.</p><p><p>

## JK Rowling: Seems odd men can get away with fantasizing about murdering women in the name of trans activism, no?

There was a time when women <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ashley-judd-feminist-poem" target="_blank">held rallies demanding to be heard</a>, where if you offered the slightest criticism, you were labeled sexist no questions asked. Now it's 2023 and you can fantasize about murdering those women. However, and this is a key detail, you can only fantasize about murdering women who are deemed to be "anti-trans." If women believe they should have a safe space away from people who still have a penis, feel free to think about running them over with your car. Author JK Rowling, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/harry-potter-book-name-removed" target="_blank">who has been vocal on the matter</a>, is curious as to why.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>In the olden days, a bygone era of 2018, women would hold what was called a "Women's March." They would <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/smell-like-feminist-new-pussy-hat-perfume" target="_blank">wear crocheted vaginas on their heads</a> and talk about their feelings, Then <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/womens-march-co-chair-calls-starbucks-racist-for-working-with-the-adl" target="_blank">the Women's March got canceled</a> because <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/womens-march-cancelled-white" target="_blank">there were too many white people involved</a>. </p><p>In 2023, it's now the Let Women Speak Rally. Women worldwide believe they deserve the freedom to speak out against political issues that affect them. In this case, against the political belief that men can be women and therefore deserve access to all women-only facilities. Because trans people rank number one on the left's pound-for-pound most marginalized rankings, politicians pander to whatever feelings they have this week at the expense of women. Women continue to plummet in the rankings unless they check off a second marginalized box.</p><p>If women don't like it, they have two options in the eyes of trans-activists. One is to shut up and only speak until spoken to. The other is to be murdered. Rowling finds that to be somewhat hypocritical.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Weird, isn’t it, but I struggle to remember any other progressive movement that attracted so many men who love fantasising about the brutal deaths of women. <a href="https://t.co/mX0DYhfv42">pic.twitter.com/mX0DYhfv42</a><br />— J.K.

</small>
</p><p>As you recall, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/crowder-dont-sign-contracts" target="_self">last week</a>, Crowder released portions of a redacted contract offered to him without naming the party behind the offer. The released portions showed if Crowder had signed, he could have faced penalties for getting censored by Big Tech:</p><p>"If any of the major platforms (e.g. YouTube, Facebook, Apple Podcasts, Spotify) issues a content strike (other than a "companywide" content strike) such that Crowder content cannot be monetized on such platform, and the company is not able to resolve the issue within 90 days, then the fee will be reduced by 25% from that point forward."</p><p>The Daily Wire then responded, outing themselves as the entity behind the offer. Crowder in turn responded, releasing portions of a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/crowder-responds-daily-wire" target="_self">phone call </a>between him and Executive Producer Jeremy Boreing.</p><p>Last night on TimCast, Crowder addressed many of the arguments made by The Daily Wire and those who oppose him on this issue. Crowder pointed out that the arguments against him keep changing: first, it was about the $50 million offered to him, next it was outrage over the recorded phone call, and then it was about employee NDAs. Crowder pointed out how this is gaslighting and a tactic of the left.</p><p>Crowder also explained the crux of his issue with The Daily Wire: "I have no problem with people choosing to be monetized on YouTube [...] I only have a problem when you tell people that you are fighting back and they're expecting and investing, and you're demanding that everybody else do it the same way as you do. There's only one side demanding that."</p><p>Make sure to watch the video in its entirety to hear Steven's full explanation and defense. And head over to <a href="https://www.stopbigcon.com/" target="_blank">StopBigCon.com </a>and become a signatory to help fight back against Big Con.</p>
