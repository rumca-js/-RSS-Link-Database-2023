<a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/">Giving What We Can</a>
members have pledged to donate at least 10% of what they earn to help
others as best they can, but this is broader than it was originally.
The pledge was specific to global poverty, and only became 

<a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/cause-neutrality">cause-neutral</a>
in late 2014 after 

<a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/9Xp7BGoKnbSiP3Ng8/should-giving-what-we-can-change-its-pledge">a
lot of discussion</a>.  I think that discussion is interesting to
review now that we can see how it worked out, and is probably more
interesting than continuing with this post below where I look at minor
wording changes.



<p>

But, if you want to stick around for my looking through the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> for minor wording
changes, here are the five versions it captured on the site.

</p>

<p>


The first one is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110726123337/http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/our-pledge/index.php">2011-07-26</a>,
with:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<blockquote>
I recognise that I can use part of my income to do a significant
amount of good in the developing world. Since I can live well enough
on a smaller income, I pledge that from today until the day I retire,
I shall give at least ten percent of what I earn to whichever
organizations can most effectively use it to fight poverty in
developing countries. I make this pledge freely, openly, and without
regret.
</blockquote>



<p>

Sometime between <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140208030748/http://givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/the-pledge">2014-02-08</a>
and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140603024731/https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge">2014-06-03</a>
the pledge was changed to:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<blockquote>
I recognise that I can use part of my income to do a significant
amount of good in the developing world. Since I can live well enough
on a smaller income, I pledge that for the rest of my life or until
the day I retire, I shall give at least ten percent of what I earn to
whichever organisations can most effectively use it to help people in
developing countries, now and in the years to come. I make this pledge
freely, openly, and sincerely.
</blockquote>



<p>

This expansion brought in things like interventions that save lives
without necessarily making people less poor, interventions that take a
while to pay off, and even <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/9Xp7BGoKnbSiP3Ng8/should-giving-what-we-can-change-its-pledge?commentId=MNQFhGsgPQvXSWM7i">reducing
existential risk</a> (provided that you think it's still worth it when
only including the benefit to people in developing counties).  I can't
find any discussion of this at the time, but if there was please
point me to it!

</p>

<p>

The big change was a few months later, sometime between <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141127052745/https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge">2014-11-27</a>
and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107070427/https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge">2015-01-07</a>,
when they changed it to:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<blockquote>
I recognise that I can use part of my income to do a significant
amount of good. Since I can live well enough on a smaller income, I
pledge that for the rest of my life or until the day I retire, I shall
give at least ten percent of what I earn to whichever organisations
can most effectively use it to improve the lives of others, now and in
the years to come. I make this pledge freely, openly, and sincerely.
</blockquote>



<p>

Expanding the pledge to be cause netural was <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/9Xp7BGoKnbSiP3Ng8/should-giving-what-we-can-change-its-pledge">very
controversial</a>: people were worried it would dilute what GWWC stood
for, and hurt its credibility.  On the other hand, there's a lot of
value in having a pledge we can all stand behind, plus encouraging
people to make a lifetime committment to a specific cause is contrary
to a lot of what EA stands for.

</p>

<p>

Changes since then have been pretty minor.  Between <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200907105108/https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge/">2020-09-07</a>
and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200919180352/https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge/">2020-09-19</a>
it gained some blanks for expiration and amount:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<blockquote>
I recognise that I can use part of my income to do a significant
amount of good. Since I can live well enough on a smaller income, I
pledge that from now until __ I shall give __ to whichever
organisations can most effectively use it to improve the lives of
others, now and in the years to come. I make this pledge freely,
openly, and sincerely.
</blockquote>



<p>

Asking GWWC, they said this was to allow one version of the main text
to cover what had previously required <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/trial-pledge">other</a>
<a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/further-pledge">variants</a>.

</p>

<p>

Later, between <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220208085033/https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge/">2022-02-08</a>
and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220213084231/https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge/">2022-02-13</a>
it gained one last blank, for the start date:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<blockquote>
I recognise that I can use part of my income to do a significant
amount of good. Since I can live well enough on a smaller income, I
pledge that from __ until __ I shall give __ to whichever
organisations can most effectively use it to improve the lives of
others, now and in the years to come. I make this pledge freely,
openly, and sincerely.
</blockquote>



<p>

Asking GWWC again, this was to cover both cases where someone was
intending to start on a future date, and also cases where people
wanted to pick a date in the past so the pledge would cover earlier
income.
