## Show HN: Infisical – open-source secrets manager for developers

<p>Two months ago, we left our jobs at AWS and Figma to continue building Infisical.<p>It is an open-source end-to-end encrypted tool that helps you manage developer secrets across your team, devices, and infrastructure.<p>During the previous Show HN, we got a lot of useful feedback which we’ve been iterating on A LOT!<p>In the past month, we’ve been pretty much working 24/7, and we added:
- Integrations for Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Actions, Render, and Fly.io
- Public API
- User activity logs
- Point-in-time recovery and secret versioning
- Custom environments
- Kubernetes operator (<a href="https://infisical.com/docs/integrations/platforms/kubernetes">https://infisical.com/docs/integrations/platforms/kubernetes</a>)
And made lots of other performance improvements both on the frontend and backend.<p>Our repo is published under the MIT license so any developer can use Infisical. The goal is to not charge individual developers. We make money by charging a license fee for some enterprise features as well as providing a hosted version and support.<p>In the coming weeks, we plan to add features like key rotation, alerts, and secret groups - as well as continue adding more integrations.<p>Give it a try (<a href="https://github.com/Infisical/infisical">https://github.com/Infisical/infisical</a>)! We’d love to hear what you think!<p>Main website: <a href="https://infisical.com/">https://infisical.com/</a></p>

<p>So far I've used it to reference ideas from books I've read before.<p>I've also used it to explore books I have not read before by asking the bot questions.<p>Some people have told me they use it like a reading companion. They pause while reading the book if they have a question, and use Konjer to answer it.</p>

<p>Hello everyone.
I created a very niche product for my payment gateway customers. They are struggling with the manual process of marking transaction(s) as received in QuickBooks for their franchisor reports and bookkeeping.<p>Paysync.ca turns a manual process into an almost fully automated solution by turning a transaction into a Sale Receipt.<p>We currently support NMi gateways or affiliated gateways and soon importing CSV files.<p>If you are interested you can join the beta program at <a href="https://paysync.ca" rel="nofollow">https://paysync.ca</a>
Hacker News registrants will be granted access in front of the line.<p>Have a good day!</p>

## Launch HN: Matano (YC W23) – Open-Source Security Lake Platform (SIEM) for AWS
 - [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34505603](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34505603)

<p>Hi HN! We’re Shaeq and Samrose, co-founders of Matano (<a href="https://matano.dev">https://matano.dev</a>). Matano is a high-scale, low-cost alternative to traditional SIEM (e.g. Splunk, Elastic) built around a vendor-agnostic security data lake that deploys to your AWS account.<p>Don’t worry — we’ll explain all this jargon in a second.<p>SIEM stands for “Security Information and Event Management” and refers to log management tools used by security teams to detect threats from an organization's security logs (network, host, cloud, SaaS audit logs, etc.) and send alerts about them. Security engineers write detection rules inside the SIEM as queries to detect suspicious activity and create alerts. For example, a security engineer could write a detection rule that checks the fields in each CloudTrail log and creates an alert whenever an S3 bucket is modified with public access, to prevent data exfiltration.<p>Traditional SIEM tools (e.g. Splunk, Elastic) used to analyze security data are difficult to manage for security teams on the cloud. Most don’t scale because they are built on top of a NoSQL database or search engine like Elasticsearch. And they are expensive — the enterprise SIEM vendors have costly ingest-based licenses. Since security data from SaaS and cloud environments can exceed hundreds of terabytes, teams are left with unsatisfactory options: either not collect some data, leave some data unprocessed, pay exorbitant fees to an enterprise vendor, or build their own large-scale solution for data storage (aka “data lake”).<p>Companies like Apple, HSBC, and Brex take the latter approach: they build their own security data lakes to analyze their security data without breaking the bank. “Data lake” is jargon for heterogeneous data that is too large to be kept in a standard database and is analyzed directly  from object storage like S3. A “security data lake” is a repository of security logs parsed and normalized into a common structure and stored in object storage for cost-effective analysis. Building your own data lake is a fine option if you’re big enough to justify the cost — but most companies can’t afford it.<p>Then there’s the vendor lock-in issue. SIEM vendors store data in proprietary formats that make it difficult to use outside of their ecosystem. Even with "next-gen" products that leverage data lake technology, it's nearly impossible to swap out your data analytics stack or migrate your security data to another tool because of a tight coupling of systems designed to keep you locked in.<p>Security programs also suffer because of poor data quality. Most SIEMs today are built as search engines or databases that query unstructured/semi-structured logs. This requires you to heavily index data upfront which is inefficient, expensive and makes it hard to analyze months of data. Writing detection rules requires analysts to use vendor-specific DSLs that lack the flexibility to model complex attacker behaviors. Without structured and normalized data, it is difficult to correlate across data sources and build effective rules that don’t create many false positive alerts.<p>While the cybersecurity industry has been stuck dealing with these legacy architectures, the data analytics industry has seen a ton of innovation through open-source initiatives such as Apache Iceberg, Parquet, and Arrow, delivering massive cost savings and performance breakthroughs.<p>We encountered this problem when building out petabyte-scale data platforms at Amazon and Duo Security. We realized that most security teams don't have the resources to build a security data lake in-house or take advantage of modern analytics tools, so they’re stuck with legacy SIEM tools that predate the cloud.<p>We quit our jobs at AWS and started Matano to close the gap between these two worlds by building an OSS platform that helps security teams leverage the modern data stack (e.g. Spark, Athena, Snowflake) and efficiently analyze security data from all the disparate sources across an organization.<p>Matano lets you ingest petabytes of security and log data from various sources, store and query them in an open data lake, and create Python detections as code for realtime alerting.<p>Matano works by normalizing unstructured security logs into a structured realtime data lake in your AWS account. All data is stored in optimized Parquet files in S3 object storage for cost-effective retention and analysis at petabyte scale. To prevent vendor lock-in, Matano uses Apache Iceberg, a new open table format that lets you bring your own analytics stack (Athena, Snowflake, Spark, etc.) and query your data from different tools without having to copy any data. By normalizing fields according to the Elastic Common Schema (ECS), we help you easily search for indicators across your data lake, pivot on common fields, and write detection rules that are agnostic to vendor formats.<p>We support native integrations to pull security logs from popular SaaS, Cloud, Host, and Network sources and custom JSON/CSV/Text log sources. Matano includes a built-in log transformation pipeline that lets you easily parse and transform logs at ingest time using Vector Remap Language (VRL) without needing additional tools (e.g. Logstash, Cribl).<p>Matano uses a detection-as-code approach which lets you use Python to implement realtime alerting on your log data, and lets you use standard dev practices by managing rules in Git (test, code review, audit). Advanced detections that correlate across events and alerts can be written using SQL and executed on a scheduled basis.<p>We built Matano to be fully serverless using technologies like Lambda, S3, and SQS for elastic horizontal scaling. We use Rust and Apache Arrow for high performance. Matano works well with your existing data stack, allowing you to plug in tools like Tableau, Grafana, Metabase, or Quicksight for visualization and use query engines like Snowflake, Athena, or Trino for analysis.<p>Matano is free and open source software licensed under the Apache-2.0 license. Our use of open table and common schema standards gives you full ownership of your security data in a vendor neutral format. We plan on monetizing by offering a cloud product that includes enterprise and collaborative features to be able to use Matano as a complete replacement to SIEM.<p>If you're interested to learn more, check out our docs (<a href="https://matano.dev/docs">https://matano.dev/docs</a>), GitHub repository (<a href="https://github.com/matanolabs/matano">https://github.com/matanolabs/matano</a>), or visit our website (<a href="https://matano.dev">https://matano.dev</a>).<p>We’d love to hear about your experiences with SIEM, security data tooling, and anything you’d like to share!</p>

<p>I’ve been visiting HN for more than a day. Almost daily.<p>While Reddit, Digg, FB, Twitter etc have jammed in more features and ads looking like posts, HN has remained high signal to noise ratio.<p>Thank you for that.<p>As I get older, my brain is unable to deal with ads and too much flashy imagery/videos.<p>HN is an oasis.<p>My only ask is to revisit CSS a bit and make it mobile friendly. I.e slightly larger fonts and hit areas for expand/collapse. It’s too easy to hit the wrong button on a phone.<p>Thank you for keeping HN clean.</p>

I'm also ready to do what is necessary to stop relying on some faceless entity to manage it, I'm just not sure what to use, or where.<p>Plan A: Nextcloud on Linode. Probably not the dirt cheapest choice, but affordable as a steady expense right now, and it seems to provide a lot of resource headroom while I get on top of how it works and what my actual needs are gonna be re compute and bandwidth and so forth, as well as allowing me to stand up any extra services I may want on this web presence - Nextcloud's open nature is good for that as well, but I want access to the system itself.<p>What I need:<p>I will be using one of the Nextcloud office suites for the same stuff I currently do on Google - text documents (chord charts mostly), spreadsheets, etc.<p>Likewise I will be figuring out how to hoover every photo and video taken by our phones and computers up into a backup collection, and we can then treat our phones like "thin clients" which are only representing our data, not storing it. I have not successfully used any organizational aids for pictures before so for now I'll be happy just to have a collection of dated folders for each phone, and we'll improve from there. It will be stored in some sort of cheap bucket or block storage as well as on my local ZFS server (seems like block storage might be the better choice for that reason).<p>Likewise I want to get all my email history backed up somewhere other than gmail's servers on an ongoing basis. I don't think I'll stop using that email address and I don't expect to actually <i>control</i> my email (nor would I want to), but I don't want to be in a position anymore where Google could just up and decide to lock me out of my own communications history based on some algorithm. That said, I will probably also setup some sort of alternate email that is not on any .com platform and possibly transition to it over time, and all email will end up here.<p>Re platform, I <i>think</i> that I could probably do it a lot cheaper on AWS, and I <i>think</i> I know how to get that done without getting snagged by one of their runaway expense traps, but I'm not completely sure. I do not trust them not to find some way to slip a thousand dollar bill past me before I realize what their automated system is doing.<p>Linode, on the other hand, have a good reputation in terms of competence and reliability, and from what I can tell the price they are offering is not completely out of whack. They even offer the quick deploy version, but I do believe I would just take a raw server and stand it all up myself, I have security people in my family who can make sure I'm not hanging my junk out the front door before I go live.<p>I am also considering Digital Ocean, who I've dealt with a little bit in the past and found them great.<p>Future plans for this server include some kind of federated publishing - Nextcloud might even have some sort of blogging extension that could be further extended, or maybe even it's already implemented, I'm not that up on it yet. It's just a high profile self-hosting system that I noticed.<p>Or I might add a small Mastadon to the server for the same people who use the Nextcloud, but I'm hearing a lot about runaway transfer fees so I'm gonna wait and see before I stand one up myself. But that's why the raw server instead of the one-click solution, one way or another I'm gonna get on ActivityPub.<p>Anyways, thoughts anyone? Like I said, current plan is Nextcloud on Linode for a while and see how it goes, but if there's something leaner or more extensible or that handles ActivityPub better or whatever I'd love to know.</p>

## Ask HN: ‘Following’ Other HN Users?

<p>I’m conflicted about even asking this. I do really love that HN is only very lightly curated for me, and I’m evenly exposed to the opinions of a fairly random sample of people on a daily basis. It’s easily the standout feature of this site.<p>But still… It does often feel too ephemeral. I sometimes wish I were able to easily keep track of what some people are posting on here and interact more directly. It’s easy enough to sort of keep up with some of the more prolific accounts because they’re often almost hard to avoid, but that’s about it.<p>As an example, I ran into a few people in a thread once that live nearby (statistically fairly unlikely!) and there was talk of meeting up, but that was the end of it, because how else could we coordinate? I can’t even find that thread now, but I’m still up for some beers, gorge residents!<p>Anyway, sorry, I’m rambling. Really I was just wondering if anyone has any good tools for following other HN users’ activity.</p>
