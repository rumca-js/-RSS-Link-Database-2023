<p><strong>Sundance film festival:</strong> the singer impresses as an experience-hardened mother in rapidly gentrifying New York in a beautiful if underwhelming film</p><p>In the brief snippets that form the opening montage of A Thousand and One, it’s clear writer-director AV Rockwell has an assured aesthetic sense: street corners buzzing with chatter and pulsing with 90s hip-hop, greetings and handshakes, the cacophony of 1994 Brooklyn as it bends around an assured Teyana Taylor’s take-no-prisoners walk. We first meet Taylor’s Inez a year earlier, in a single sumptuous shot at Riker’s Island; now she’s back, beeper on her hip, looking for Terry (Aaron Kingsley Adetola), the six-year-old child she left behind.</p><p>Rockwell’s beautiful yet underwhelming debut set over a decade in rapidly gentrifying New York, proceeds unemphatically, like a collection of artfully staged vignettes loosely unspooled from a single impulsive act. That act – Inez, a 22-year-old hairdresser desperate to restart, steals Terry from under the nose of his foster family – first appears to us, as it likely would to the characters, as far less consequential and dramatic than it is. For all Inez’s fire and the stakes of their predicament (no work, no place to live, few bridges left unburned, a crime against the state), Inez and Terry’s escape to Harlem plays out, through cinematographer Eric Yue’s ravishing cinematography and Gary Gunn’s warm score, as almost languid and easy.</p><p>A Thousand and One premiered at the Sundance film festival and is seeking distribution</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/24/a-thousand-and-one-movie-review-sundance">Continue reading...</a>

<p>If at first you don’t succeed. Or even at the second attempt. It had looked like being one of those nights for the Newcastle forward, Joelinton, who saw a first-half goal ruled out for handball and then advanced his contender for miss of the season at the beginning of the second period.</p><p>The quicksilver Miguel Almirón had crossed and, after a double deflection, the ball sat up for the onrushing Joelinton inside the six yard box, the goal gaping. When he lifted high, he could have been forgiven for wanting to be a very long way away – say, back in Newcastle.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/24/southampton-newcastle-united-carabao-cup-semi-final-first-leg-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The US president’s case is very different from Donald Trump’s handling of official material. But this carelessness is regrettable</p><p>There is no real equivalence between the classified documents <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/22/justice-department-finds-more-classified-documents-at-joe-bidens-home">found in Joe Biden’s possession</a> at a former office and his home in Wilmington, Delaware, and those taken from Donald Trump. The president had just a tiny fraction of the thousands found on Mr Trump’s premises – but more important is the men’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/20/classified-documents-biden-trump-explained">dramatically different handling</a> of the issue. Mr Biden’s team realised there were documents wrongly held, turned them over, and voluntarily allowed the FBI into his home to search for any more. In contrast, Mr Trump was required to return all classified material by a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/12/us/politics/justice-department-trump-classified.html">grand jury subpoena</a>, relating to the potentially unlawful removal and destruction of White House documents. His lawyers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/13/us/politics/trump-classified-material-fbi.html">said he had done so</a>. The justice department then spent months trying to resolve the matter before it was obliged to obtain a warrant for a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/sep/02/trump-mar-a-lago-search-doj-photos">search of Mar-a-Lago</a> – turning up many more classified papers.</p><p>Nonetheless, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/jan/20/joe-biden-donald-trump-and-those-classified-documents-podcast">discovery of the documents</a> held by Mr Biden – and especially the drip-drip manner in which they have emerged – is an embarrassment. The president has been sold on his probity and competence compared to the man who preceded him, and challenged Mr Trump’s carelessness regarding classified material. The distinctions between the cases may well be lost on many voters, particularly given the rightwing media’s expertise in whataboutery. Senior Democrats have been exasperated enough to be <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-politics-united-states-government-merrick-garland-9c875e913618a68ac73d9e41505ab769">unusually critical</a> of Mr Biden.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/24/the-guardian-view-on-bidens-classified-documents-not-malign-but-a-mistake">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The move towards blessings for civil unions is a step forward. But next month’s General Synod will be fraught</p><p>During a Lambeth Palace press conference last week, the archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell, <a href="https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2023/27-january/news/uk/blessings-are-a-big-step-forward-insist-emotional-archbishops">told</a> the sad story of a close friend who failed to smuggle a reading from the Song of Songs into his civil partnership ceremony. Prevented from marrying his same-sex partner in church, the priest in question was also banned from expressing his faith in a secular context.</p><p>New <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/18/church-of-england-bishops-refuse-to-back-gay-marriage">recommendations</a> on same-sex relationships, just published by the Church of England’s House of Bishops, hopefully herald an end to such cruel absurdities. After a tortured process of reflection and debate, the bishops have proposed that clergy should be allowed to bless civil unions in church should they choose to do so – as is the case in Wales. A ban on same-sex civil marriages for clergy will also be reviewed, along with celibacy requirements that have fostered corrosive suspicion at parish level. Mr Cottrell was justified last week in <a href="https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/23258824.stephen-cottrell-says-church-give-new-blessings-same-sex-couples/">describing</a> these proposals – to be discussed at next month’s General Synod – as a “real step forward” in the journey towards recognition for LGBTQ+ Christians.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/24/the-guardian-view-on-the-c-of-e-and-same-sex-marriage-kicking-the-can-down-the-road">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After No 10’s useful idiot had failed to defend Nadhim Zahawi’s reputation, Richard Sharp was grilled in a BBC safe house</p><p>When the chips are down. When all else seems lost. At least Rishi Sunak will always have a Chris Philp. When they realised Nadhim Zahawi was not going to be fired and that Richard Sharp was not going to resign, most ministers ran for the hills. Switched off their phones. Hid under the duvet. Refused to answer the door. Just in case they were asked to go out on Tuesday’s media round. They had their pride – in a few cases, their self-worth – to consider.</p><p>But not Philp. Not the ever loyal, hopelessly devoted to Rish!, junior policing minister. A man who has never passed a pile of cold sick he wasn’t tempted to eat. Who would do anything – ANYTHING – to curry favour with the boss class. His not to wonder why, his but to do or die. And die he does, time and time again, on his feet as he’s sent out to defend the indefensible. Either his short-term memory is completely shot and he has no recollection of his past failures or he genuinely doesn’t care. Being humiliated on national TV and radio is a badge of honour.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/24/devoted-philp-dies-on-his-feet-again-defending-the-indefensible">Continue reading...</a>

## Carbon offsets are a licence to pollute | Letters

<p>Ecosystem protection must become the default, not the add-on, writes <strong>Dr Phil Williamson, </strong>while <strong>Richard Middleton </strong>says the concept of offsetting itself is the problem</p><p>Your report (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/revealed-forest-carbon-offsets-biggest-provider-worthless-verra-aoe">Revealed: more than 90% of rainforest carbon offsets by biggest provider are worthless, analysis shows, 18 January</a>) makes uncomfortable reading for enthusiasts of nature-based solutions to climate change. While forest protection should provide a win-win situation, benefiting both biodiversity and climate, it can too easily become lose-lose, because carbon offsets allow emissions to continue, worsening global heating and threatening not just forests but all natural ecosystems. The problem is that reliable quantification of the “additionality” of nature-based climate mitigation is near-impossible.</p><p>The answer is that ecosystem protection (and restoration, wherever possible) must become the default, not the add-on. Until that happens, any carbon trading based on natural processes should be limited to the offset of biologically based emissions, excluding those from fossil fuels. <br /><strong>Dr Phil Williamson</strong> <br /><em>University of East Anglia</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/24/carbon-offsets-are-a-licence-to-pollute">Continue reading...</a>

Martin McDonagh’s tragicomedy The Banshees Of Inisherin, about two men falling out in a remote island community at the time of the civil war, has a host of nominations: including best picture with McDonagh getting best director and best screenplay nods, best actor for Colin Farrell, best supporting actor(s) for Brendan Gleeson and Barry Keoghan and best supporting actress, for Kerry Condon. In addition to which, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/nov/06/masculinity-can-be-expresssed-in-many-ways-paul-mescal-interview-aftersun">Paul Mescal</a> gets a best actor nomination for his performance in Charlotte Wells’s beautiful father-daughter drama <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/21/aftersun-review-beach-holiday-with-paul-mescal-and-daughter-is-a-sunny-delight">Aftersun</a>; Colm Bairéad’s The Quiet Girl is nominated for best international feature and Tom Berkeley and Ross White’s An Irish Goodbye is nominated for best short.<br /><br />Otherwise, there is some unease at the gravitational pull towards the mainstream: an all-male directing list (Charlotte Wells or Marie Kreutzer could have got in there) and Danielle Deadwyler’s excellent performance in Till is ignored in the best actress list. There has been some haughty online dismissal of Ana de Armas’s nomination for her performance as Marilyn Monroe in Andrew Dominik’s condescending psychodrama Blonde (although the problem is surely with the film rather than De Armas), and a mixed response on social media for the estimable Andrea Riseborough’s best actress nomination for the tough indie drama To Leslie, largely due to a wary response to a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/18/to-leslie-andrea-riseborough-oscar-campaign">celebrity-driven viral campaign</a>. But the always excellent Riseborough certainly shakes things up.</p><p>Cate Blanchett naturally takes pole position in the best actress list for her much-acclaimed uber-conductor role in Tár, a female-Furtwängler supernova of problematic power display. However, the best actor list is harder to call – though it could well be that Austin Butler will clinch it for his heartfelt impersonation of Elvis Presley, a performance much admired by the star’s late daughter Lisa Marie Presley.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/24/oscars-2023-a-welcome-turn-to-ireland-aside-these-are-very-conventional-picks">Continue reading...</a>

## Black teachers, trans women, cleaners and cons: how the BBC’s Open Door allowed ‘real people’ to let rip

<p>It ran for a decade and infuriated the rightwing press, giving a voice to marginalised Britain. Now a new show is celebrating the extraordinarily prescient Open Door series</p><p>In 1973, Mike Phillips was working as a teacher in Paddington when he was contacted out of the blue by the Community Programme Unit of the BBC. Soon afterwards, he found himself presenting a programme about the ways in which black children were discriminated against in the British education system. Entitled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhCbdD30az4">Black Teachers</a>, it was broadcast late on the evening of 16 April 1973 on BBC Two, with Phillips chairing a studio discussion and introducing some hard-hitting filmed reports on the issue.</p><p>“Looking back, it all seems quite strange,” says Phillips, who went on to become a journalist and celebrated crime novelist, “not least because at that time you could walk through the BBC building and not encounter another black person. What’s more, there were not that many black teachers in British schools, but we managed to find six who all felt like I did. We had a point to make and we made it as aggressively as possible. It was a big deal when it came out, because it just wasn’t the done thing at that time.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/jan/24/black-teachers-trans-women-cleaners-cons-the-bbcs-open-door">Continue reading...</a>

Rangers were the holders at the time, had never lost in the first round, had never been beaten by lower-league opposition … oh, and had three years earlier tried to force through a league reconfiguration that would have jettisoned Berwick back into the non-league shadows from which they had only recently emerged. The fact Berwick are English added a further level of ignominy, although given Rangers see themselves very much as a UK-wide concern, perhaps we’re lending that particular fact more weight than it deserves.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/24/football-daily-email-darvel-aberdeen">Continue reading...</a>

## The media exploited Amy Winehouse’s life. A new biopic looks set to do the same with her death

<p>The first look at Back to Black has prompted anger for depicting the late singer as a cartoonish mess. Is it possible to make a film about an abused artist without repeating history?</p><p>It’s only been a week since Sam Taylor-Johnson’s Amy Winehouse biopic Back to Black began filming in London, but the backlash has already come thick and fast. Over the weekend, pictures of Marisa Abela and Eddie Marsan in character as Amy and her father, Mitch Winehouse, made their way on to Twitter. The reaction was one of pure vitriol, with one particularly viral tweet describing the images of Abela, looking cartoonishly distraught in a halloween costume-level approximation of Winehouse’s trademark beehive, as “fucking revolting”: 34,000 likes and 3,500 quote tweets seemed to agree with the sentiment.</p><p>It’s hard to judge a film before even a single frame has been officially released, but it’s understandable that the set photos touched a nerve. In recent years, Winehouse’s troubled life and entirely preventable death have become emblematic of the ways that the entertainment and media industries fail young stars. Winehouse was a hugely talented musician who seemed to be surrounded by people more intent on wringing money from her than protecting her mental or physical health; this July marks 12 years since she died, and in that time, it would seem that the music industry has hardly become a more hospitable place for female musicians. In recent years, many stars of Winehouse’s stature have disclosed similar struggles with drug abuse and disordered eating to those experienced by the singer during her lifetime. Much of her career was a media circus, with tabloids and commentators fixating on her weight, her substance abuse issues and her public meltdowns. The stark images of Abela on set feel like they play into the very same voyeuristic impulses that led to Winehouse’s decline. (Distressing, too, are <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2023/01/24/marisa-abela-opens-up-about-losing-weight-to-portray-amy-winehouse-18150862/">Abela’s comments</a> on her “really positive” experience of losing weight to play Winehouse, which include no mention of the singer’s bulimia.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/24/back-to-black-new-amy-winehouse-biopic-sam-taylor-johnson-marisa-abela">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Maybe you’d like to know the story behind their names, or who have they most enjoyed collaborating with? Now’s your chance to ask the iconic hip-hop trio</p><p>For years, fans have been clamouring for the early work of iconic NYC hip-hop trio De La Soul to be put on streaming services. Due to issues over rights, sample clearance and royalties, foundational albums such as 1989’s 3 Feet High and Rising and 1991’s De La Soul Is Dead have been absent from the internet for years, much to the chagrin of anyone with even the slightest interest in golden-age rap music. All of that changes this March, when the band’s celebrated first six records will finally be released for streaming.</p><p>It’s sure to be a watershed moment in a career that’s already been filled with them. A smash hit upon release, 3 Feet High and Rising instantly cemented rappers Posdnuos, Trugoy and Maseo as three of the wittiest and most innovative MCs working, and provided an effervescent, unique counterpoint to the gangsta rap dominating hip-hop culture at the time. Sampling artists as disparate as Johnny Cash, Funkadelic and Steely Dan, 3 Feet High and Rising has been acknowledged as a huge influence on many artists who came after.</p><p>This article was amended on 24 January 2023.

<p>With its polyfoam beasties and diddly-dee charm, the latest from comedy-horror specialist Jon Wright sustains suspense amid silliness</p><p>The 90s straight-to-video horror series Leprechaun was rebooted a few years back, but this is better. A young London couple expecting their first child escape inner-city dystopia for a diddly-dee Irish village when one inherits their aunt’s country pile. However, such unearned property wealth can never go unpunished – especially not in a housing crisis – and inevitably there’s a catch. Local folklore tells of “little people” – definitely not leprechauns – at the end of the garden, who’ll turn nasty if they don’t get their nightly blood offering.</p><p>Man of the house Jamie (Douglas Booth) fears he may not be man enough for this particular house. That leaves his heavily pregnant wife Maya (Hannah John-Kamen) alone to fend off all manner of local threats, including, but not limited to, the Whelans, a clan of riotous roofing contractors (Derry Girls’ Jamie-Lee O’Donnell and Kristian Nairn, AKA Hodor from Game of Thrones), headed up by the aggressively avuncular Daddy Whelan (Colm Meaney). He really does insist on being called “Daddy”. By everyone.

<p>From sweaty Love Island contestants professing love to The Traitors’ ultimate catchphrase, reality shows have been taken over by a three-digit saying – even if it is arithmetical baloney</p><p>Earlier this month, Rishi Sunak outlined plans to force students in the UK to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jan/03/rishi-sunak-to-propose-maths-for-all-pupils-up-to-age-18">study maths until they are 18</a>. His proposal was roundly criticised, with the Association of School and College Leaders dismissing it as “out of touch”. Perhaps if Sunak had convinced one particular subset of British humanity to get on board first, however, things might have been different. I’m talking about reality TV stars and their obsession with numbers, specifically percentages. From Made in Chelsea to The Traitors to Love Island, you can’t escape their all-prevailing new catchphrase: “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7usSqyoZNvo">100%</a>”.</p><p>On last Monday’s launch episode of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/love-island">Love Island</a>, Ron was asked if he was ready to settle down. “Yeah, 100%” came his reply, as he sat sweaty and topless in the South African sun, waiting to pick or reject the first of five women sporting painful-looking bathing suits. Later, having paired off with fellow Harry Potter stan Lana, he mused, “When I’m in, I’m 100%”, in relation to his commitment levels. Meanwhile Shaq, who had earlier complimented (?) his new partner Tanya with the words “She looks insane”, offered up “Yeah, no, 100%” when asked if he could sense the sexual tension between them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/24/100-per-cent-reality-tv-catchphrase-love-island-traitors">Continue reading...</a>

It’s such a beautiful vegetable, and I like cooking it right over an open flame, which adds a nice smokiness, and serving with chilli jam and crisp, fried garlic. Make sure all sides of the aubergine are cooked over the flame, then peel the skin. I make a chilli jam by mixing 250g sugar with 250g water until dissolved, then stirring in chopped chilli and lime juice to taste, and heating until thickened. Thinly slice 50g garlic and fry in oil. Place the aubergine on the plate and roughly chop. Sprinkle some salt and za’atar, and garnish with parsley, four or five fried garlic slices, the chilli jam and a drizzle of pomegranate molasses.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/24/agile-aubergine-10-easy-delicious-vegan-plant-based-meals-to-make-in-a-hurry-at-home">Continue reading...</a>

Carlos Acosta’s Havana-based company was always intended to be many things: a proudly Cuban outfit that could hold its own on the European touring circuit; a group of dancers comfortable in every style from ballet to hip-hop to Cuban dance styles; and a choice of international choreographers who aren’t just the same old names.</p><p>In all that, Acosta Danza succeeds, and it’s always a pleasure to watch these dancers, even if the rep tonight doesn’t set the stage on fire. They have a clear passion for performance, great energy and presence; all very different bodies, but increasingly familiar faces. <a href="https://www.acostadanza.com/en/company/raul">Raúl Reinoso</a> and <a href="https://www.acostadanza.com/en/company/mario-sergio">Mario Sergio Elías</a>, who have been with the company since it began in 2016 , both have strong solo moments, and the striking <a href="https://www.acostadanza.com/en/company/zeleidy">Zeleidy Crespo</a> arrives in Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui’s Faun like the tall stem of an elegant bloom, strongly rooted even when the choreography buffets her body in every direction.</p><p>At the <a href="https://www.roh.org.uk/tickets-and-events/spectrum-by-acosta-danza-details">Linbury theatre, Royal Opera House, London</a>, until 30 January</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jan/24/acosta-danza-spectrum-review-linbury-theatre-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From squabbles over finance to disagreements about electric vehicles, discord with the EU will define the next few years</p><p>Just under three years since the United Kingdom left the European Union – and over six since it voted to do so – the bilateral relationship remains a subject of often bitter debate between the two sides and within the UK itself.

Yet this was the affluent home counties, and ambulance drivers have, historically, been the least popular people to go on strike. You don’t call an ambulance unless you really need one, so it’s hard for people to imagine the ambulance driver who isn’t essential.</p><p>When the BBC has <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62134314">a day-by-day planner to show who’s on strike</a>; when three of the least radical professions on earth are withdrawing their labour (physiotherapists, meteorologists and driving instructors); when you’re planning a night out with an eye on whether the trains are running, you might expect that public support for industrial action would be at an all-time low. The opposite is true: support for striking nurses and ambulance workers is running at 66% and 63% respectively. Almost <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/12/20/nurses-and-ambulance-workers-have-most-public-supp">three times as many people blame the government</a> as blame the unions. Union hardship funds are raising hundreds of thousands of pounds from general donations. Resistance is back, and it’s organised; it has support, dignity, solidarity.<strong> </strong>It is taking shape in union action, and answered in civil society, with the Don’t Pay campaign and Enough Is Enough. The creed of flag-waving stoicism, belt-tightening for Britain, with all its paraphernalia, its scones, bunting, mugs and allotments, has fallen apart. Nobody wants to keep calm and carry on.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/24/dont-keep-calm-and-carry-on-how-britain-got-a-furious-new-attitude">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From potential ‘new coach bounce’ to the power of Ireland and France, championship can raise interest before the World Cup</p><p>It was hard to put your finger on it but there was a different feel to this year’s Six Nations launch. Perhaps it was the Netflix cameras around every corner seeking to project rugby to a wider global audience. Maybe it had something to do with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/06/eddie-jones-sacked-as-england-rugby-union-head-coach">Eddie Jones no longer being around</a> to stir the media pot. There was even a solo acoustic guitarist serenading the hacks as they munched their lunch, which was unquestionably a first.</p><p>Or maybe, just maybe, it was a sign of a professional sport making a concerted effort to raise its game. One by one the head coaches of the competing nations stepped up to the microphone and spoke with intelligence and candour. Contentious subjects such as the new waist-high tackle trial in England were openly addressed rather than swerved. And the next few weeks, everyone agreed, would be unmissable.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/24/enticing-six-nations-campaign-is-rugby-unions-big-chance-to-shine">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Korea’s most wanted escape their handcuffs on a cargo ship back to the motherland but find they are not alone in bloody thriller</p><p>If you had a pound for every slashed jugular and staved-in cranium in this Korean horror-thriller, you would probably have more than the film’s entire budget. This seems to have been mostly spent on supplies of fake blood almost copious enough to run the sprinkler system on Frontier Titan, the 58,000-tonne cargo ship travelling between the Philippines and South Korea in Kim Hong-sun’s film.</p><p>Forget Con Air; this is Con Sea, with bruiser cop Seok-woo (Park Ho-san) in charge of escorting a dirty dozen or so fugitives back to the motherland. First among evils is Jong-doo (Seo In-guk), a rapist with boyband looks and tattoos up to his jawline, who earns an early beating from Seok-woo after threatening his daughter. It doesn’t take a doctorate in whup-ass studies to guess that the criminals don’t stay in handcuffs for long. But – unbeknown to all but the doctor who keeps sneaking down to the basement – they are not Frontier Titan’s only cargo. Suffice it to say that transporting this thing on the same ship as Korea’s most wanted is the action-movie equivalent of that meme about the nuclear power plant and the spider farm being next to each other.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/24/project-wolf-hunting-review-korean-horror-brings-bruckheimer-esque-bombast">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A new Janice Hallett mystery, a pair of post-apocalyptic locked-room spine chillers and a shadowy death in a sun-kissed Greek resort are among this month’s highlights</p><p>What a treat to be back in a world created by the machiavellian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/nov/20/the-appeal-writer-janice-hallett-i-wrote-about-bubble-bath-for-15-years">Janice Hallett</a>. After the brilliance of her debut, <em>The Appeal</em> – the story of a murder in a small village with 15 suspects, which the reader solved along with the investigators and that was far too good to be a first novel – Hallett gave us something different entirely in <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/17/the-twyford-code-by-janice-hallett-review-mind-bending-heartwarming-mystery">The Twyford Code</a></em>, a transcription of audio files, packed with codes to crack, revealing the secrets of a vanished teacher. <strong><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-mysterious-case-of-the-alperton-angels-9781800810402">The Mysterious Case of the Alperton Angels</a></strong><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-mysterious-case-of-the-alperton-angels-9781800810402"> </a>(Viper, £16.99) is, again, entirely fresh and different. This time, Hallett delves into darker territory, as true-crime writer Amanda Bailey has the task of digging into the old case of a cult that persuaded a girl that her baby was the antichrist. The self-styled Angels all killed themselves at the time and the baby went into the care system. But 18 years on, Bailey’s publisher wants her to track the child down because there’s money to be made from their story. “There are no tragic blondes. Just a wacky cult, four dead, mutilated men and a mystery no one’s had the chance to uncover properly yet. You’ll be the first. Imagine that,” her agent persuades her. Told as if we were opening the safe deposit box that holds Bailey’s documents – a mix of emails, transcriptions, texts and articles – this thriller slowly pieces together a story that is very different from the one told in the press at the time. Another cracking mystery from an author with gallons of talent and bags of originality.</p><p>Veteran crime writer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/26/peter-may-returning-to-a-runaway-youth">Peter May</a> was all set to retire after he published <em>The Night Gate</em> in 2021. Then <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop26-glasgow-climate-change-conference-2021">Cop26</a>’s failures ignited his rage. They also set him on a research project into the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-crisis">climate crisis</a> that persuaded him he needed to write about the catastrophe looming in our future. <strong><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/a-winter-grave-9781529428483">A Winter Grave</a></strong> (Riverrun, £22) is set in the Scottish Highlands almost 30 years from now, after the “Big Change” has hit the world. “Scotland had escaped relatively lightly. Large parts of eastern England had simply vanished under the North Sea.” Much of London is underwater. But this is the background to May’s crime story, which opens as young meteorologist Addie finds the body of a man entombed in ice up a mountain. When Glasgow detective Cameron Brodie travels to the isolated location to investigate the murder, he discovers a deadly and far-reaching conspiracy. May has created a chilling, believable near-future where people just like us are dealing with the devastating consequences of the climate crisis. He’s also written an atmospheric locked-room mystery packed with mountainous adventures and dangerous escapes. His anger with the situation occasionally comes across as a bit of a blunt object – “Kolkata, where I was born, is somewhere under the Bay of Bengal these days… Just don’t get me started on how the world failed to meet its net zero targets,” Brodie is told by his pathologist colleague Sita Roy at one point – but then again, perhaps it needs to. This is chilling as much for May’s vision of where we’re heading as for the body count.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/24/the-best-recent-and-thriller-writing-review-roundup-janice-hallett">Continue reading...</a>

## Britain treasures the Parthenon marbles. But could returning them be more valuable? | Charlotte Higgins

<p>Politicians fear that handing back disputed would asset-strip the British soul. The truth is, it might enrich us</p><p>What do we talk about when we talk about cultural restitution? In popular discourse in Britain, returning artefacts to their communities of origin is almost invariably framed as a loss. Minds leap to a vision of our museums violently pillaged: walls bare, sculpture courts deserted, store rooms despoiled – a fascinating reversal of how at least some (albeit, to be fair, a tiny minority) of museum objects in the UK were actually acquired.</p><p>There is a constant fear, in this kind of thinking, that the restitution of one object necessarily leads to the restitution of all objects, that <em>après moi, le déluge</em>. Returning the Parthenon sculptures to Athens – to use a not-so random example – “would open the gateway to the question of the entire contents of our museums”, as Michelle Donelan, the culture secretary, put it <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-64235854">in a BBC interview</a> earlier this month. It would be, she said, “a very slippery slope to go down”. She described the sculptures as “assets of our country”. Losing the Elgin marbles, according to this kind of formulation, would lead to a kind of asset-stripping of the British soul.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/24/britain-parthenon-marbles-return-museums">Continue reading...</a>

<p>He has admitted to feeling anxious and wanting everything to be perfect. I know he will become more comfortable, in time, but is there anything I can do to help?</p><p><strong>My boyfriend</strong><strong> (20)</strong><strong> and I</strong><strong> (18) have been dating for two and a half months, like each other a lot and</strong><strong> have good sex. </strong><strong>He definitely enjoys sex with me a lot but he never ejaculates</strong><strong> because he says he gets soft the moment he feels he’s about to. I am his first sexual partner</strong><strong> and his first proper girlfriend</strong><strong>, so it’s hard to ask him what he likes because even he’s not sure. We also live in shared accommodation </strong><strong>so we can’t do it that often. He</strong><strong> has admitted to feeling anxious because he’s my </strong><strong>sixth sexual partner</strong><strong> and fourth boyfriend</strong><strong> </strong><strong>– and he wants to be perfect</strong><strong>, although I</strong><strong> have reassured him</strong><strong>. </strong><strong>I know </strong><strong>it will </strong><strong>just take time for him to get comfortable, but is there anything I can do to help</strong><strong>?</strong></p><p>You are correct in assuming it will take time. Sexual finesse does not arrive naturally and is not easily achieved. Rather, it is something people learn over many years. The best thing you can do is try to have fun with him. Being playful during lovemaking reduces anxieties and the sense of performance pressure. And, although you have developed a pattern that seems to work, be prepared to mix it up and try other styles. Some people find it difficult at first to switch from solo sex to partner sex, so allow him to discover how to without you always leading. There is probably a position that will work best for him and help him climax, but he needs to feel safe to try different ways – focusing on his own pleasure rather than yours.</p><p>Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</p><p>If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to <a href="mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com">private.lives@theguardian.com</a> (please don’t send attachments).

<p>Roasted cauliflower and tahini, baked squash and haricot beans, creamy rice and berries – vegetarian, yes, and more importantly, delicious</p><p>My shopping begins with the fruit and vegetables. It always has done. Thoughts about what is in season, what is at its best at this moment, have always come before anything else. Rummaging through market stalls or surveying the long table at the greengrocer’s is the part of food shopping I enjoy most. It always seems like a good place to start. But often that is where it finishes too.</p><p>This month’s recipes are suitable for vegetarians and three of them are – with a tweak here and there – good for vegans too. I have roasted cauliflower and made a chickpea sauce to go with it; baked slices of golden-fleshed pumpkin to eat with a bean and winter tomato sauce, and marinated and grilled aubergines. There is a crisp pancake of grated root vegetables to eat with a winter salad or stuff into a soft roll, and dessert too, a refreshing take on a traditional rice pudding.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/24/nigel-slater-winter-vegan-vegetarian-recipes-roast-cauliflower-baked-squash">Continue reading...</a>

## Still Pictures by Janet Malcolm review – a great writer’s photographic memories

<p>A posthumous collection of essays, sparked by old photos of her Czech refugee family and friends, lucidly sketches a lost world</p><p>Janet Malcolm famously despised biography. While she found journalism, with its mandate “to notice small things”, deliciously congenial, she thought biographical research led only to an “insufferable familiarity”, the fat volumes resulting from it being little more than processing plants in which “experience is converted into information the way fresh produce is converted into canned vegetables”. As for autobiography, that great literary craze of the late 20th century, it is misnamed. As she notes in <em>Still Pictures</em>, the slim book that is her last, it is a novelistic enterprise, and not to be trusted. Memory is patchy and partial. What does this or that story prove? The answer is: almost nothing, in the end. The gold is “dross”.</p><p>But memoir’s call is siren, and ultimately, not even Malcolm was entirely immune. <em>Still Pictures, </em>published posthumously (she <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/20/rip-janet-malcolm-america-finest-nonfiction-writer">died in 2021, at the age of 86</a>), is a collection of short autobiographical essays: selective postcards of asperity and wisdom that she delivers with, if not embarrassment, exactly, then a certain amount of equivocation and avoidance. Not wanting to bloody herself too much on the rocks of disclosure, Malcolm cleverly deploys an old ally in the form of photography, about which she once wrote for the <em>New Yorker</em>. Most of these pieces, if not all, are sparked by the contemplation of fuzzy black and white images pulled from boxes in her attic – and doesn’t the camera always lie? The most brazen fabulist of them all, its near constant presence undercuts just about every line Malcolm writes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/24/still-pictures-by-janet-malcolm-review-a-great-writers-photographic-memories">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Those stoner days were hugely liberating’: Kiwi musicians reflect on a counterculture like no other

<p>Cut off from the ‘swinging’ innovations of 60s London, a generation of New Zealand musicians forged an underground scene that propelled the nation’s modern identity</p><p>In the 21st century, New Zealand is widely hailed as home to a progressive Labour government, a hi-tech film and TV industry, formidable wineries and sagacious singers Lorde and Aldous Harding, alongside much else. It’s a far cry from the 1960s when the conservative National Party government maintained “rule Britannia”: little television – and zero film – was homemade, local brewery DB’s tasteless beers were the nation’s tipple and popular musicians tended to faithfully replicate British stars. But cracks in a conformist society began to appear towards the end of that decade, as a homegrown counterculture sprang up thanks to the government’s support for the US war in Vietnam and rock music developing into a vehicle for dissent.</p><p>For a nation now attuned to reevaluating its post-colonial history, there has been surprisingly little attention paid to this period when youthful energy disrupted Kiwi society via protest, humour, poetry and music. A new book, Jumping Sundays: The Rise and Fall of the Counterculture in Aotearoa New Zealand, details how, inspired by the Beats and the Beatles, an array of maverick personalities began shaking the nation out of its somnolence.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/24/those-stoner-days-were-hugely-liberating-kiwi-musicians-reflect-on-a-counterculture-like-no-other">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Campaign seeks to restore seas otters to northern California and Oregon: ‘They are really important to coastal ecosystems’</p><p>Before the fur trade drove them to near extinction, sea otters once roamed the waters of North America from Alaska to Baja California. Now a non-profit conservation group wants to see them brought back, and say the otters could help restore the region’s crucial but decimated kelp forests.</p><p>The Center for Biological Diversity has petitioned the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to reintroduce the furry mammals to a large swath of the west coast stretching from northern California to Oregon, pointing to the vital role otters play in the coastal ecosystem. A small population of southern sea otters lives on California’s central coast, where the Monterey Bay Aquarium regularly documents their adventures, but the threatened animal occupies just 13% of its historic range.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/23/sea-otter-reintroduction-west-coast-california">Continue reading...</a>

But, finally the most consulted upon piece of legislation in Holyrood’s history – the gender recognition reform (Scotland) bill – was passed. Then, almost straight away, the Westminster government said it was considering vetoing it.</p><p>Alister Jack, the Scottish secretary, said the bill would affect UK-wide equality law. So, he announced, he would block it using never-before-used legislation. Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, reacted furiously, calling this course of action a “full-frontal assault” on devolution.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/jan/24/why-is-scotland-gender-reform-bill-so-contentious-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
