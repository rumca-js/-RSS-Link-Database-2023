<p>The U.S. Department of Justice and eight states, including California, filed suit against Google in a Virginia federal court on Tuesday, claiming that the company illegally used its market powers to dominate Internet advertising.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.pacermonitor.com/view/IAZ2QBY/UNITED_STATES_et_al_v_Google_LLC__vaedce-23-00108__0001.0.pdf?mcid=tGE3TEOA&amp;xcust=2-2-1483090-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">court filing</a> originally reported on <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/24/tech/doj-google-lawsuit/&amp;xcust=2-2-1483090-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">by CNN</a>, the DOJ and the states asked the court to, &ldquo;at minimum,&rdquo; force Google to divest itself of its Google Ad Manager suite&mdash;including both Google&rsquo;s publisher ad server, DFP, and Google&rsquo;s ad exchange, AdX&mdash;plus any additional structural relief that the court deemed necessary. </p>



<p>Google called the suit &ldquo;an attempt to pick winners and losers&rdquo; by the DOJ.</p>



<p>The 149-page suit accuses Google of using its influence to remove competition from the ad tech market. The DOJ claimed, for example, that Google keeps about 30 cents of each ad tech dollar that flows through from an advertiser to a publisher. </p>



<p>&ldquo;The harm is clear: website creators earn less, and advertisers pay more, than they would in a market where unfettered competitive pressure could discipline prices and lead to more innovative ad tech tools that would ultimately result in higher quality and lower cost transactions for market participants,&rdquo; the suit claims. &ldquo;And this conduct hurts all of us because, as publishers make less money from advertisements, fewer publishers are able to offer internet content without subscriptions, paywalls, or alternative forms of monetization.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The suit alleges that Google essentially bought itself control over Web advertising from both a publisher and advetiser perspective via its 2008 purchase of DoubleClick, which gave it both access to an ad exchange (AdX), as well as a publisher ad server, known as a DFP. &ldquo;In effect, Google positioned itself to function simultaneously as buyer, seller, and auctioneer of digital display advertising,&rdquo; the suit alleges.</p>



<p>Though the suit dives deep into the intracacies of the ad business, the suit claims that on one hand Google was artificially inflating the prices of the ads to the benefit of publishers. But the suit also harmed publishers as well, as Google Ads drove out other competition. If they had remained in the market, the additional competition may have benefited the market. The suit claims that by 2015, Google owned 90 percent of the online advertising market.</p>



<p>Other attempts by advertisers to wrest back control, such as yield managers and header bidding, were also foiled, the suit says.</p>



<p>Google&rsquo;s statement called the suit a &ldquo;flawed argument.&rdquo; </p>



<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s lawsuit from the DOJ attempts to pick winners and losers in the highly competitive advertising technology sector,&rdquo; the company said in a statement. &ldquo;It largely duplicates an <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/ag-paxtons-false-claims-still-dont-add-up/&amp;xcust=2-2-1483090-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">unfounded lawsuit</a> by the Texas Attorney General, much of which was recently <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/the-courts-decision-to-dismiss-much-of-the-texas-ags-antitrust-case/&amp;xcust=2-2-1483090-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">dismissed</a> by a federal court. DOJ is doubling down on a flawed argument that would slow innovation, raise advertising fees, and make it harder for thousands of small businesses and publishers to grow.&rdquo;</p>

## League of Legends source code stolen, being held ransom

<p>While it seems commonplace to hear about <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1469048/watch-out-for-phishing-attacks-after-the-latest-credit-breach.html">hackers attacking financial institutions</a> and other locations with huge troves of customer information, the video game industry is no stranger to the issues of information security. Case in point:<em> League of Legends</em> publisher Riot Games announced today that it was the victim of a cybersecurity attack. Hackers are threatening to release the source code for <em>League of Legends</em>, one of the most popular free-to-play games in the world, if their demands are not met. </p>



<p>According to posts on <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/riotgames/status/1617900234734198787&amp;xcust=2-3-1483082-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Riot&rsquo;s official Twitter account</a> (spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://therecord.media/riot-games-receives-ransom-email-for-stolen-source-code-following-social-engineering-attack/&amp;xcust=2-3-1483082-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Record</a>), the attack occurred last week, using undisclosed social engineering techniques. Social engineering uses conventional deception instead of technical hacking, such as fooling an employee into giving up their access credentials with a fake email header. According to Riot, thieves were able to access the company&rsquo;s infrastructure to steal game source code for <em>League of Legends </em>and the new mobile strategy game <em>Teamfight Tactics</em>, as well as anti-cheat tools. </p>



<p>While Riot says that no customer data was accessed, the stolen information could leave the games vulnerable to new cheats and exploits. That&rsquo;s on top of the more straightforward possibility of the source code getting &ldquo;loose&rdquo; and less scrupulous developers simply copying Riot&rsquo;s games. Even so, Riot said it will refuse to pay the hackers. </p>



<p>The attack caused a temporary pause in updates to the affected games, and may result in a slower rollout of patches in the future. It won&rsquo;t help here, but while you&rsquo;re waiting for those patches, take the time to perform these <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394001/5-easy-tasks-supercharge-your-security.html">5 easy tasks that supercharge your security</a>.

## Amazon launches RxPass, a $5/mo prescription service

<p>If you&rsquo;re trying to save money on prescription drug refills, Amazon has some interesting news today: the launch of RxPass, a $5-per-month add-on to Amazon Prime that will cover the costs of prescription drugs and shipping for prescription drug refills &mdash; but excludes some key states.</p>



<p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://pharmacy.amazon.com/rxpass&amp;xcust=2-1-1483058-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Amazon&rsquo;s RxPass</a> is part of Amazon Pharmacy, which already offers lower-priced prescription drugs. Amazon Pharmacy will remain, but RxPass will also be available in 42 states. Unfortunately, residents of California, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Washington aren&rsquo;t eligible, Amazon said. </p>



<p>For those who live elsewhere, though, Amazon&rsquo;s RxPass sounds like it could offer substantial savings, whether or not you have insurance. &ldquo;RxPass is a benefit for Prime members that gives subscribers access to the most common generic medications for a flat fee of $5 a month,&rdquo; according to Amazon. &ldquo;Subscribers can get all their prescribed medications on the RxPass list filled as often as they need for one flat monthly fee. RxPass also works with auto-refill so that you get all your eligible prescriptions automatically for no more than $5 a month.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Over <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://pharmacy.amazon.com/rxpass?asc_campaign=kinjagizmodolink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://gizmodo.com/amazon-prime-rxpass-launch-pharmacy-generic-drugs-1850023034&amp;asc_source=8634ce58e7321280bca91e626292087f4ff6c0f4&amp;tag=kinjagizmodolink-20#all-rxpass-meds&amp;xcust=2-1-1483058-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">50 medications are covered</a> by RxPass, including medications for diabetes, gout, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and more. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="amazon rxpass" class="wp-image-1483070" height="514" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/RXPass-2.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Amazon&rsquo;s RxPass offers discounts on popular medications.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Amazon&rsquo;s RxPass does come with some restrictions, however. Medicare and Medicaid recipients aren&rsquo;t eligible, and you can&rsquo;t pay for an RxPass via an FSA or HSA plan. Instead, you&rsquo;ll have to use the Amazon Pharmacy plan instead. And, of course, you have to be an existing Amazon Prime member, which costs $14.99 per month or $139 per year.</p>



<p>Alternatively, customers searching for low-cost prescription drugs online can turn to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://costplusdrugs.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1483058-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">CostPlus Drugs</a>, founded by entrepreneur Mark Cuban. Cuban (and his partner, TruePill) charge a markup of 15 percent on the supplier price of the pill, and supply them to all 50 states. CostPlus accepts prescription insurance for Capital Blue Cross, Rightway, and other &ldquo;select prescription plans,&rdquo; according to the site. CostPlus will supply as much medicine as a doctor prescribes.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a full-time goblin like me and do almost everything at your computer, chances are your peripherals could use a good cleaning. Not only do I regularly eat lunch at my desk (a bad habit, I know), but I&rsquo;ve also got longer hair and many of those loose strands end up in the crevices of my mechanical keyboard. </p>



<p>Fortunately, it&rsquo;s pretty easy to clean a mechanical keyboard, as you can pop off the keycaps and remove those hard-to-reach particles. Since my personal keyboard was long overdue for a deep cleaning, I went ahead and broke down the process with step-by-step instructions. Read on to learn more.</p>

## Elon Musk teases an even pricier ad-free Twitter Blue subscription

<p>Twitter CEO Elon Musk says he plans on rolling out a &ldquo;higher priced&rdquo; ad-free version of Twitter Blue, the monthly subscription service that allows you to edit your Tweets and now includes a blue &ldquo;verified&rdquo; checkmark next to your name, despite not verifying the identities of subscribers. Joy. </p>



<p>This may be in response to Blue&rsquo;s low subscriber count as well as the social media company&rsquo;s 40 percent decline in advertisement revenue, which was originally reported by The Verge&rsquo;s Alex Heath in his <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/19/23563429/twitters-legal-woes-are-mounting&amp;xcust=2-1-1482856-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Command Line newsletter</a>. So, when will it launch and how much will it cost? We have absolutely no idea. As you can see in the Tweet thread below, Musk is being rather stingy with that information.</p>

<p>This news comes on the heels of Twitter <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1479844/twitter-officially-bans-third-party-apps.html">banning third-party apps</a> and sort of sweeping it under the metaphorical rug. In true Twitter fashion, the company made the change before telling anyone about it, suddenly shutting down access to third-party apps, issuing a statement that it was due to &ldquo;enforcing long-standing API rules&rdquo; days later, and then even <em>later</em> <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/agreement&amp;xcust=2-1-1482856-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">retroactively issuing new rules</a> that banned those apps. This sudden change nuked long-loved Twitter clients like Tweetbot and Twitterrific. Industry observers suggested that the move occurred because third-party apps often don&rsquo;t show sponsored Twitter ads.</p>



<p>Musk also tweeted about the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1616594332907372544&amp;xcust=2-1-1482856-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">next Twitter update</a>, which will &ldquo;stop switching you back to recommended tweets.&rdquo; Will this update ever see the light of day? Who knows. Last month, Twitter featured a button that allowed you to pick which version of the timeline you&rsquo;d like to use. This option vanished, however, when the social media company released a UI that lets you swipe between the two. These changes are happening at a breakneck pace and I&rsquo;m not sure I like it. Is Twitter overpromising to save its hide? Likely.</p>

<p>What, exactly, does Google want to do with Fuchsia? The answer isn&rsquo;t any clearer now than when news broke about the Google-created operating system <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/416284/googles-fuchsia-os-is-out-in-the-open-and-shrouded-in-mystery.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">seven years ago</a>. But after <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1479842/google-lays-off-12000-employees-as-the-tech-industry-tightens-its-belt.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">a recent round of Google layoffs</a>, the project may be in peril in a way that long-standing products like Android and Chrome OS are not. The recent reduction in headcount has hit the internal project particularly hard, leaving its future more in question than ever. </p>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/20/business/google-alphabet-layoffs.html?s=09&amp;xcust=2-1-1482845-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the New York Times</a>, 16 percent of the 400-strong Fuchsia team is getting the axe. That&rsquo;s a pretty huge cut for any workforce, but Fuchsia is particularly hard-hit. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/big-layoffs-at-googles-fuchsia-os-call-the-projects-future-into-question/&amp;xcust=2-1-1482845-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">As Ars Technica notes</a>, the cut to the development team is more than double the company-wide cut of six percent. With dozens of employees gone or soon to be, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine that Fuchsia will continue with its current steam&hellip;if it has any to begin with. </p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re wondering what Fuschia OS is, you&rsquo;re not alone &mdash; possibly not even within the halls of Google itself. On paper, Fuschia could be almost anything. It&rsquo;s an open-source operating system, a la Chrome or Android, but built on a custom kernel, not an existing codebase like Linux or Unix. In its nebulous state it could be applied to smartphones, tablets, laptops, or all three. The operating system is more than capable of running modern apps and browsers, and speculation has been that it could be a combined next-gen OS meant to unify Google&rsquo;s consumer-focused offerings. But if Fuchsia is the future of Google software, it doesn&rsquo;t seem like the company is in any rush to get there. </p>



<p>Google has released versions of Fuchsia that can run on its own Pixel-branded Chromebooks (which themselves are now few and far between), but to date the only hardware that officially runs Fuchsia in a released state is the Google Nest Hub smart home line. The Fuchsia update replicated the previous software, which was similar to the Chromecast, with no notable user-facing changes or feature additions. </p>



<p>What does the future hold for Fuchsia? At this point things don&rsquo;t look that bright. Google has earned, if not exactly cultivated, a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1338418/rip-stadia-google-gives-up-its-game-streaming-ghost.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">reputation for starting and abandoning projects</a>. With Android and Chrome doing fine (though not exactly conquering the world like they were a few years ago), Fuchsia would seem to be an obvious target for cost-cutting efforts. That hasn&rsquo;t happened yet, though chopping off a significant percentage of the development team is an ominous sign. </p>

## Samsung says new Galaxy laptops will have 120Hz OLED displays

<p>Samsung&rsquo;s display business has revealed that its new Galaxy Book laptops will include OLED displays with 120Hz resolution.</p>



<p>Samsung has confirmed that it will be holding its Samsung Unpacked launch event on February 1 in San Francisco. On Monday, Samsung Display revealed some of the characteristics of its upcoming Galaxy Book laptops, though the company did not specifically confirm any of the Galaxy Book models that Samsung will presumably unveil.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Samsung Display plans to first apply its large-sized OCTA technology to Samsung Electronics&rsquo; new high-end Galaxy Book model and expects to complement a chic design with high portability,&rdquo; the company said. &ldquo;In addition, Samsung Display showcases the panel performance of its products with displays featuring 16:10 ratio, 120Hz refresh rate, and 3K resolution.&rdquo;</p>



<p>OCTA stands for On-Screen Touch AMOLED, the technology that Samsung first applied to its Galaxy phone lineup. While OLED panels generally improve the visual display contrast &mdash; OLED panels feature pixels that are individually lit, so that pixels that are &ldquo;off&rdquo; generate perfect blacks &mdash; the OCTA technology improves the manufacturability of the panel itself. Specifically, OCTA technology removes the touch layer of the panel and integrates that sensor into the panel itself. That thins the panel by about 6 to 11 percent, according to Samsung, and makes it easier and greener to manufacture.</p>



<p>Based on what we saw from CES, we&rsquo;ve concluded that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1446853/10-must-see-monitors-from-ces-2023-on-the-cusp-of-a-revolution.html">2023 is the cusp of a revolution</a> in both miniLED and OLED technologies for PC monitors. Samsung has been on the forefront of OLED monitor production for years, though CES 2023 revealed that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1428656/these-new-asus-laptops-may-have-the-best-display-youve-ever-seen.html">Asus has gone all-in on OLED displays</a> as well, even 3D versions. Samsung Display apparently is confirming that Samsung Electronics will continue that trend, with its first 120Hz panels in the Galaxy Book lineup for gaming and/or content creation, potentially at a 3K resolution. </p>



<p>Samsung Display is apparently implying that at least one of its high-end Galalxy Book laptops will have these new display features, but that&rsquo;s yet to be verified. To date, only content-creation laptops like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/538948/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-review-the-future-is-here.html">Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio</a> have boasted a 120Hz display. Adding this feature to the Galaxy Book lineup will shake things up.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re struggling to stay on top of your tasks or keep track of your notes, maybe what you need are some new tools.</p>



<p>I&rsquo;m always looking for better ways to stay organized. When I find a new app that sounds promising, I pit it against my existing tools in a game of survival of fittest, leaving only the ones that work best for me.</p>



<p>These are currently the five services I rely on the most for note-taking, bookmarking, and task management. Most offer premium subscriptions, but their free tier hold up well for individual users. As we head into the new year, perhaps they&rsquo;ll provide just the kind of fresh inspiration you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>

<p>Every weekday morning, my desktop computer automatically loads&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://tweek.so/&amp;xcust=2-1-1438507-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Tweek Calendar</a>, a beautifully simple app and website for managing weekly tasks. You can add new tasks by typing on the blank lines, and you can move items around by dragging and dropping.</p>



<p>A paid subscription adds Google Calendar sync, recurring tasks, and subtasks, but I don&rsquo;t need any of that. For me, Tweek isn&rsquo;t a heavy-duty task manager or full-blown Google Calendar replacement, but rather a quick way to reflect on the remaining week. (<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.fastcompany.com/90654271/to-do-list-browser-trick&amp;xcust=2-1-1438507-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">This story I wrote for Fast Company</a>&nbsp;describes how you can set up the auto-loading component.)</p>

<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Notion desktop app, showing a scratchpad with links and notes." class="wp-image-1438515" height="749" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/notionpwa.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>When I&rsquo;m ready to start a task in earnest, I&rsquo;ll create a page for it in&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.notion.so/&amp;xcust=2-1-1438507-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Notion</a>, which lets you create freeform notes with their own checklists, subpages, tables, and more. Notion can be intimidating at first, but if you&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://advisorator.com/members/2021/02/12/2-9-2021-give-this-note-taking-app-a-chance/&amp;xcust=2-1-1438507-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">start with simple notes and expand outward</a>, you&rsquo;ll quickly see how powerful it can be.</p>



<p>The hub for all my written work is a page called &ldquo;Jared&rsquo;s Scratchpad.&rdquo; From there, I have links to subpages for my <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://advisorator.com/free&amp;xcust=2-1-1438507-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Advisorator</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://jarednewman.com/cordcutterweekly/&amp;xcust=2-1-1438507-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Cord Cutter Weekly</a> newsletters, along with any freelance articles I&rsquo;m working on. Each of those pages might have their own subpages if further organization is necessary. (One example: When I&rsquo;m interviewing people for a story, I&rsquo;ll create separate pages for every source, each with their own transcriptions and highlighted quotes.)</p>



<p>Once I&rsquo;m finished with a story, I file it away to my &ldquo;Archive&rdquo; folder, effectively clearing it off my to-do list. This works better for me than any dedicated task management tool, because there&rsquo;s no limit on the kinds of notes I can create.</p>



<h2 id="google-keep-for-temporary-items">Google Keep for temporary items</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Google Keep app showing grocery list, notes view, and an individual note" class="wp-image-1438516" height="827" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/googlekeeppcw.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>Notion&rsquo;s biggest weakness is that it can feel clunky for simple notes. When I just need to quickly jot something down or dictate it by voice, I use&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://keep.google.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1438507-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Google Keep</a>, whose reverse-chronological layout lends itself to transient notes. It&rsquo;s my go-to app for storing sudden flashes of inspiration, writing down group take-out orders, and avoiding&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://youtu.be/SUsUu3XRJ4I?t=44I&amp;xcust=2-1-1438507-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Seinfeldian parking garage mishaps</a>. (Apple Notes might scratch a similar itch, but I like that Keep works just as well on Android devices.)</p>



<p>My wife and I also use Google Keep for our shared grocery list. With its&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://9to5google.com/2019/12/12/google-assistant-keep-shopping-list/&amp;xcust=2-1-1438507-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Google Assistant integration</a>, we can ask any nearby Google Home or Nest speaker to add an item to the list, usually right after realizing we&rsquo;ve run out of something.</p>



<h2 id="raindrop-for-bookmarks">Raindrop for bookmarks</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Bookmarks and reading view in Raindrop.io" class="wp-image-1438519" height="771" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/raindroppcw.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>For me, bookmarks exist in their own category of notetaking, deserving of special treatment. I use&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://raindrop.io/&amp;xcust=2-1-1438507-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Raindrop.io</a>&nbsp;to save all the stories I plan to read and write about in my newsletters, filing them away with either Raindrop&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://raindrop.io/download&amp;xcust=2-1-1438507-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">browser bookmarklet</a>&nbsp;or the share function of its mobile apps. This becomes its own kind of to-do list, as I gradually delete items from my story queue as I&rsquo;m building each newsletter.</p>



<p>Raindrop goes well beyond the capabilities of browser-based bookmarking. You can mark each folder with its own icon, read articles in a distraction-free view, and share collections with others. But I mostly just like Raindrop for its comfortable, straightforward app design and the ability to use it across virtually any computing platform.</p>



<h2 id="google-assistant-or-siri-for-time-based-reminders">Google Assistant (or Siri) for time-based reminders</h2>



<p>Whenever I need to get something done at a particular time, I use whatever voice assistant happens to be on hand. That might be Siri if I&rsquo;m carrying an iPhone, or Google Assistant if I&rsquo;m using Android. The point is that I can just use voice commands to quickly give myself a reminder and move on, knowing that I&rsquo;ll get notified on my phone or smart speaker when the time comes.</p>

The Acer Predator XB273U is for you. Besides the outstanding 360Hz refresh rate, it also packs excellent color performance and good 1440p image quality. Acer didn&rsquo;t skimp on the design either, which has a premium sturdy feel to it. The XB273U is a great display for gamers who play at the highest levels, but it has day-to-day appeal beyond that and even some nice qualities for content creators.</p>
</div>


<p>Gamers who crave motion clarity should be pleased with the monitors arriving in 2023, and the Acer Predator XB273U F is a first look at what they should expect. It&rsquo;s among the first 27-inch, 1440p monitors with a 360Hz refresh rate, and it relies on a new panel that promises even better motion clarity than older 24-inch 360Hz monitors. The monitor&rsquo;s motion performance doesn&rsquo;t come cheap but does set a new standard for clarity.</p>

<h2 id="acer-predator-xb273u-f-the-specs">Acer Predator XB273U F: The specs</h2>



<p>The Acer Predator XB273U F is among a new breed of 27-inch, 1440p monitors with a 360Hz refresh rate. This is the best combination of refresh rate and resolution that is currently available. A few monitors with a refresh rate up to 540Hz are announced, like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1446853/10-must-see-monitors-from-ces-2023-on-the-cusp-of-a-revolution.html">the Asus&rsquo; ROG Swift PRO PG248QP revealed at CES 2023</a>, but they won&rsquo;t arrive until summer of 2023.</p>



<ul><li>Display size: 27-inch</li><li>Native resolution: 2560&times;1440</li><li>Panel type: IPS</li><li>Refresh rate: 360Hz</li><li>Adaptive-sync: Nvidia G-Sync</li><li>HDR: VESA DisplayHDR 600</li><li>Ports: 2x HDMI 2.0, 1x DisplayPort 1.4, 4x USB-A, 1x USB-B, 3.5mm audio out</li><li>Stand adjustment: Height, tilt, swivel, rotation&nbsp;</li><li>VESA mount: Yes, 100x100mm</li><li>Speakers: Yes</li><li>Price: $1,099</li></ul>



<p>Refresh rate aside, the Predator XB273U F&rsquo;s specifications are typical for a premium gaming monitor. This is a display built for one purpose: speed.</p>



<h2><strong>Acer Predator XB273U F: Design</strong></h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Predator XB273U" class="wp-image-1480540" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/acer-predator-xb273u-f-360hz-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The Acer Predator XB273U F has a well-built muted black-on-black aesthetic (sadly with no RGB).</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>The Predator XB273U F is an example of Acer&rsquo;s standard Predator design language. It has a matte black-on-black aesthetic that&rsquo;s mostly subtle, though the rear does add some texture and flair. Surprisingly, there&rsquo;s no RGB lighting at all, leaving gamers to bring their own.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Build quality is good. The monitor&rsquo;s plastics feel thick and durable. The display has thin bezels, but a somewhat large bottom chin and thick rear panel, which adds to a sense of rigidity and durability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Acer offers a wide, tripod-like stand with an aggressive look and sturdy metal feet. It&rsquo;s heavy, offers significant ergonomic adjustment including height and rotation, and does an excellent job of keeping the monitor stable. However, its wide legs take up significant space on a desk. The monitor does include the usual 100x100mm VESA mount, so a third-party monitor arm or stand can be attached.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The XB273U F is great for gamers who play competitively yet remains versatile enough to work as a day-to-day monitor and handle content creation.</p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 id="acer-predator-xb273u-f-features-and-menus">Acer Predator XB273U F: Features and menus</h2>



<p>You&rsquo;ll find three video input options around back: one DisplayPort 1.4 and two HDMI 2.0. The DisplayPort 1.4 port is the only way to use the monitor&rsquo;s full 2560&times;1440 resolution at 360Hz. That&rsquo;s disappointing but seems to be standard practice for now. Similar monitors, like the Asus ROG Swift PG27AQN, share this downside.</p>



<p>The monitor includes four USB 3 Type-A ports driven by one USB Type-B upstream port, plus audio-out. That&rsquo;s a healthy range of connectivity for a gaming monitor. The USB-A ports aren&rsquo;t easy to access, so connecting a USB thumb drive or SDcard adapter isn&rsquo;t convenient.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Predator XB273U F" class="wp-image-1480543" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/acer-predator-xb273u-f-360hz-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The Acer Predator XB273U F comes with a welcomed joystick-controller for the menu system on the back.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>Enthusiasts should be pleased by Acer&rsquo;s joystick-controlled menu system, which offers a huge range of customization options. This includes five gamma modes, five color temperature modes, and six-axis color calibration. There&rsquo;s also an sRGB mode that can be turned on or off per display input, rather than for the display overall. A quick note: The sRGB mode is turned on by default. There&rsquo;s no DCI-P3 mode, however.</p>



<p>Gamers also have plenty of options. The monitor supports <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393646/tested-how-nvidia-reflex-can-make-you-a-better-esports-gamer.html">Nvidia&rsquo;s G-Sync Reflex Analyzer</a>, which can be used to measure total system input latency. It also offers a built-in aim point, a black equalizer to boost darkness in shadows, an on-screen refresh rate monitor, and a 25-inch mode (which forces the display into a 25-inch display space with 1080p resolution). All of this is useful for competitive gamers, though I did find the 25-inch mode a bit finicky (it did not always properly detect when my display output was set to 1080p).</p>



<p>On balance, the Acer Predator XB273U F has a great set of menu options and features worthy of a premium gaming monitor. Though obviously targeted at competitive e-sports players, the monitor&rsquo;s image-quality features make it suited to YouTube and Twitch creators looking to create competitive gaming content.</p>



<h2 id="acer-predator-xb273u-f-sdr-image-quality">Acer Predator XB273U F: SDR Image Quality</h2>



<p>The Acer Predator XB273U F is meant for high-refresh, competitive gaming, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it can&rsquo;t look good doing it. The monitor&rsquo;s image quality is solid in SDR content.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Predator XB273U F" class="wp-image-1480545" height="824" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/acer-predator-xb273u-f-brightness.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>Brightness is a perk for the Predator XB273U F, as it comes out swinging with a maximum brightness of 529 nits. That&rsquo;s high for SDR content and, in most cases, the monitor will be used at a mere fraction of its maximum brightness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This level of brightness might be useful if you find yourself using the monitor in a window-filled room on a sunny day, and it&rsquo;s towards the upper end of what modern IPS LCD monitors deliver.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Predator XB273U F" class="wp-image-1480546" height="831" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/acer-predator-xb273u-f-contrast.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>The XB273U F offers a maximum contrast ratio of 980:1, which is merely okay for an IPS LCD monitor in 2023. It&rsquo;s not the worst, but not the best, and the limited contrast can make dark scenes look hazy and ill-defined.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that the Asus ROG Swift PG27AQN, a key competitor, performs similarly. The Asus and Acer monitors likely use the same display panel, and there&rsquo;s a strong chance other 1440p / 360Hz monitors in 2023 will, as well.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Predator XB273U F" class="wp-image-1480547" height="828" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/acer-predator-xb273u-f-color-gamut.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>Acer&rsquo;s color gamut performance is good, delivering 100 percent of sRGB, 95 percent of DCI-P3, and 89 percent of Adobe RGB. This range of color gamut is not exceptional among premium monitors, but still great, and provides a vivid, engaging look when viewing colorful content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The color gamut is good enough to handle creative and professional tasks including general photo editing, YouTube video creation, and digital art for viewing online. Though meant primarily for gaming, the Acer Predator XB273U F performs about as well in professional content as a mid-range professional monitor like the BenQ PD2720U or <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/630536/asus-proart-pa279cv-monitor-review-the-go-to-for-content-creators-on-a-budget.html">Asus ProArt PA279CV</a> (however, the Acer&rsquo;s resolution is lower).</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Predator XB273U F" class="wp-image-1480548" height="884" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/acer-predator-xb273u-f-color-accuracy.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>Color accuracy reinforces the XB273U F&rsquo;s solid all-around performance with precise color in a broad range of situations. This level of accuracy is not the best available, but close, and errors of this degree are very difficult to notice with the human eye.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The monitor&rsquo;s color accuracy is supported by a reasonable default gamma reading of 2.3, which is slightly off the target of 2.2. Content might look darker than intended, but the deviation is small enough that I didn&rsquo;t notice it subjectively. The default color temperature was 6400K, just a hair off the target of 6500K. This means content won&rsquo;t appear too warm or cool out-of-the-box. Remember, too, that the monitor has many gamma and color temperature options to help owners dial in their preferred look.</p>



<p>What about sharpness? Unsurprisingly, the XB273U F&rsquo;s pixel density of 108 pixels per inch can&rsquo;t compete with 4K alternatives, which have about 163 pixels per inch. Small fonts can appear slightly pixelated and games don&rsquo;t look quite as detailed, especially when viewing noisy textures or extremely thin objects (like power lines or a chain-link fence). Still, 1440p resolution offers adequate sharpness for a 27-inch display, and its disadvantage doesn&rsquo;t leap unless compared side-by-side with a 4K monitor.</p>



<p>The Acer Predator XB273U F&rsquo;s overall SDR image quality is good. It has incredible brightness, great color performance, and adequate sharpness. Contrast is the obvious downside, as the monitor&rsquo;s IPS panel can&rsquo;t produce a deep, convincing black level. The monitor&rsquo;s overall image quality is not good value for money, given its MSRP of $1,099&mdash;but speed, not image quality, is the focus of this monitor.</p>

<h2 id="acer-predator-xb273u-f-hdr-image-quality">Acer Predator XB273U F: HDR image quality</h2>



<p>The Acer Predator XB273U F is VESA DIsplayHDR 600 certified. It proves to be a strong performer in HDR content, though it has limits.</p>



<p>Let&rsquo;s start with brightness. I recorded a maximum HDR brightness of 557 nits. That&rsquo;s not as high as the VESA DisplayHDR 600 certification might suggest, but it&rsquo;s close. And, perhaps more importantly, the monitor did not waver in brightness depending on the amount of the display showing bright content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The monitor handles tone mapping and color well at default settings, which is good news for general use. Flipping on Windows 11 HDR doesn&rsquo;t negatively impact color accuracy or grayscale. The Windows desktop looks much as it does in SDR sRGB mode, but brighter.</p>



<p>Contrast remains a problem. Acer tries to improve matters with a dynamic backlight mode, which is on by default. This is an edge-lit monitor with just a handful of zones, however, so the dynamic backlight causes distracting pillars and streaks of light in dark scenes. It&rsquo;s better to turn it off in most situations. This is true of both SDR and HDR, but the dynamic backlight flaws become more obvious in HDR as the monitor&rsquo;s brightness is increased.</p>



<p>The monitor&rsquo;s backlight is also a problem when displaying bright highlights, like the gleam of chrome in a dark alley or a field of stars. There&rsquo;s no way to add brightness to these small slices of the display without also brightening the entire display, which robs scenes of tension and drama. It&rsquo;s a mix, then. HDR performance is ok, but far from the best. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/560224/oled-vs-mini-led-the-pc-displays-of-the-future-compared.html">A Mini-LED monitor is a better bet </a>if eye-searing HDR is your goal.</p>



<h2 id="acer-predator-xb273u-f-motion-performance">Acer Predator XB273U F: Motion performance</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Predator XB273U F" class="wp-image-1480551" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/acer-predator-xb273u-f-360hz-5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The Acer Predator XB273U F has undisputably the best motion performance on the market today.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>The Acer Predator XB273U F&rsquo;s strong image quality is certainly nice to have but, as mentioned, it&rsquo;s not the focus. This monitor is among the first 27-inch, 1440p, 360Hz monitors on the market. Motion fluidity and clarity is the goal&mdash;and the monitor delivers.</p>



<p>Motion clarity at default settings is superb. Viewing the classic UFO test shows the tiny pupils in the three-eyed alien&rsquo;s peepers are distinct (albeit just barely), while test images from <em>DOTA 2</em> show that hitpoint bars and hero names are readable. This is an advantage over even 240Hz displays: Hitpoint bars are distinct at 240Hz (especially with OLED displays), but names are difficult or impossible to read, depending on their color relative to the background.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gamers should remember that a game needs to achieve 360 frames per second, or close to it, to see the best motion clarity. That means the XB273U F is best used with a top-tier video card like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1378383/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-content-creation-review.html">Nvidia RTX 4080 </a>and<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1434166/amd-rdna-3-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-content-creation-review.html"> AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX</a>. With that said, motion clarity is still better than most IPS displays at lower refresh rates.</p>



<p>Acer turns on an OverDrive mode by default, and it does cause visible &ldquo;overshoot.&rdquo; It appears as an over-sharpened look that surrounds bright objects and causes issues in detailed textures. Personally, I would recommend turning off this mode for general use. There&rsquo;s also an Extreme mode that throws caution to the wind and causes major overshoot to achieve maximum clarity. It can make fine details easier to see, but looks butt-ugly, so I&rsquo;d steer clear.</p>



<p>The Acer Predator XB273U F&rsquo;s overall motion clarity is among the best available on modern gaming monitors (Asus ROG Swift PG27AQN, another 1440p / 360Hz monitor, performs similarly). It&rsquo;s a step above older 24-inch, 1080p 360Hz monitors and superior to 240Hz monitors with an OLED panel. Frame pacing is also excellent thanks to support for Nvidia G-Sync. If you want the last word in motion clarity, look no further. This is it.</p>



<h2 id="should-you-buy-the-acer-predator-xb273u-f">Should you buy the Acer Predator XB273U F?</h2>



<p>Acer&rsquo;s Predator XB273U F is an excellent monitor for a particular niche.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Priced at $1,099, the monitor&rsquo;s 1440p resolution and IPS panel with edge-lit backlight can&rsquo;t compete with the quality of similarly priced OLED or Mini-LED displays.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But that&rsquo;s not the point. This is the best motion clarity available on a modern computer monitor, and it&rsquo;s likely to be the best available at 1440p resolution through the rest of 2023 (though competitors with the same panel will likely match it). The XB273U F is great for gamers who play competitively yet remains versatile enough to work as a day-to-day monitor and handle content creation.</p>
