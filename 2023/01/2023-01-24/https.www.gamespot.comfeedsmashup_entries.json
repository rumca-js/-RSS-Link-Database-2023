While not every game in the series is connected to the previous entries from a story perspective, Engage features a number of iconic characters from previous games as the Divine Emblems, which are attached to your own units, providing powerful bonuses. In the context of the story, these Emblems are heroes of the past, although Engage doesn't spend too much time explaining their origins. Here's the background of every legacy character that appears in Fire Emblem Engage as a Divine Emblem.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Marth</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1599/15997278/4090662-marth.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Marth, the Emblem of Beginnings, is the main character from Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light and its direct sequel, Fire Emblem: Mystery of the Emblem. Neither game was released outside of Japan at the time of their original releases, although Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light was eventually released worldwide on the Nintendo Switch in 2020. Marth is exiled from his home, forced to gather both the Fire Emblem and the Falchion sword to reclaim his kingdom, eventually earning the nickname \"Hero-King.\" Marth is also one of the many Fire Emblem characters to be featured in Super Smash Bros.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Lucina</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1599/15997278/4090663-lucina.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Lucina is a sword fighter and royal heir originally featured in Fire Emblem Awakening on the 3DS. Lucina is the daughter of Chrom and travels back in time from the future in an attempt to stop the Fell Dragon from destroying the land. When she travels back in time, she goes by the name Marth, attempting to channel the courage her ancestor used to save the land in his time. Lucina is also featured in Super Smash Bros.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Roy</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1599/15997278/4090664-roy.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Roy is the protagonist and playable character in Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade, which was released on Game Boy Advance in 2002, exclusively in Japan. However, that was not Roy's first appearance in a video game. Roy appeared on the Super Smash Bros. Melee roster about a year before his game was released. While The Binding Blade was not released outside of Japan, Roy's appearance in Super Smash Bros. Melee is credited with creating interest in Fire Emblem in the west, resulting in later games being released internationally. Roy is the heir to the throne in Pherae and another sword user.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Celica</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1599/15997278/4090665-celica.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Celica is one of the two protagonists in Fire Emblem Gaiden, the second entry in the series, which would later be remade as Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia for the 3DS. Celica is one of two protagonists in the game and the heir to the throne of Zofia. While she also wields a sword, her starting class is Priestess, which focuses more on using magic attacks.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Sigurd</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1599/15997278/4090666-sigurd.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Sigurd is one of the protagonists from Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War, another Japan exclusive entry in the series. Sigurd is the first protagonist to be on horseback and wield a lance. He is also the only one of the Divine Emblems in Fire Emblem Engage to be on horseback. Sigurd is also only the protagonist for the first half of Genealogy of the Holy War, which is separated into two sections featuring different protagonists.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Leif</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1599/15997278/4090667-leif.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Leif first appears in Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War as a child character, who is playable but not the main protagonist. Leif is the protagonist of the sequel, Fire Emblem: Thracia 776, which was released on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System exclusively in Japan. Like many of the early Fire Emblem titles, this game was never released outside of Japan. Leif is another sword wielder and starts as the Lord class.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Lyn</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1599/15997278/4090668-lyn.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Lyn, who's full name is Lyndis, is one of the main protagonists from Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade, which was the first Fire Emblem game to release in the West. Lyn, like many Fire Emblem protagonists, starts as the Lord class, wielding a sword. However, when she becomes the Blade Lord class, she gains an affinity for bow weapons, which can be seen by her weapon of choice in Fire Emblem Engage. Lyn is also one of the few Lord characters that does not have a cape.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Erika</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1599/15997278/4090669-erika.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Erika is one of the protagonists of Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones, alongside her twin brother Ephraim. Erika is the only Divine Emblem to have another character with her, as her brother Ephraim can be swapped in, changing her potential weapons and attacks. Partway through The Sacred Stones, players are asked to follow one of the two characters down a split path, with Erika being considered the canon choice between the two players.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Ike</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1599/15997278/4090670-ike.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Ike is the main character in Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance and one of the main characters in Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn both of which are later entries in the series. Ike also appears in Super Smash Bros. and is the first main character to not be of noble birth, instead being the leader of the Greil Mercenaries. Ike starts as the Ranger class, although he does eventually become a Lord class.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Micaiah</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1599/15997278/4090671-micaiah.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Micaiah is one of the other main characters in Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn. Micaiah is the first protagonist to exclusively wield magic and even has a special ability that allows her to give some of her own HP to her allies. Her starting class is a Light Mage and her strong focus on magic usage makes her one of the strongest main characters, although she cannot take as much damage as the others.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Corrin</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1599/15997278/4090672-corrin.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Corrin first appears in Fire Emblem Fates and is treated as a customizable avatar for the player, with the option to play as male or female and rename them. The Corrin that appears in Fire Emblem Engage is the female version. Corrin is a member of both Nohr and Hoshido royalty, the two warring nations in Fire Emblem Fates. Instead of using the generic Lord class, Corrin starts as the Nohr Prince/Princess class. Corrin also appears in Super Smash Bros.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Byleth</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1599/15997278/4090673-byleth.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Byleth is the main character of Fire Emblem: Three Houses and has one of the more unique backgrounds. Byleth starts the game as a mercenary, but is recruited to be a professor at the Garreg Mach Monastery, where the children of important figures attend school. Byleth once again can appear as male or female in Three Houses, but the version present in Engage is the male version of Byleth. Byleth starts as the Commoner Class, but has the flexibility to spec into pretty much any class in the game. Byleth is also the most recent Fire Emblem character to join the Super Smash Bros. roster.</p></h3></p><br />", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/adult-swim-cuts-ties-with-justin-roiland-rick-and-morty-will-continue/1100-6510833/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Adult Swim Cuts Ties With Justin Roiland, Rick and Morty Will Continue", "date_published": "2023-01-24 22:48:00+00:00", "description": "<p>The Adult Swim television network has announced that it has cut ties with Rick and Morty co-creator Justin Roiland.

There seems to be a general consensus that the show not only faithfully adapts the story of the game, but expands on the world, characters, and plot beats in meaningful ways. In a few short weeks, the conversation around HBO\u2019s The Last of US has gone from, \u201cThis is going to be bad,\u201d to, \u201cIs it actually better than the game?\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Opinions like these are subjective, but I saw a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/itsashleyoh/status/1612845885586812928?s=20&amp;t=WICp-GxErFZvk0nCQyM8MQ\">post on Twitter</a> that made a good point about comparing the two: You can\u2019t call one better than the other because one is a TV show and the other is a video game. The playable version of The Last of Us has game mechanics that you can interact with and critically weigh when determining if it is good or not, whereas the TV show has the flexibility to jump around in the story and follow the perspectives of numerous different characters.

These cosmetics are only available for purchase via Crafting Metals, Apex Coins, and Celestial Sunrise Apex Packs ($7 USD each). Once the event ends, these festive items will be gone forever, so anyone wishing to unlock the entire set should plan accordingly.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">But unlike the recent <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/apex-legends-all-spellbound-collection-event-cosmetics-and-rewards/2900-4571/\">Spellbound Collection Event</a> (which just ended yesterday), players who collect all 24 cosmetic items will also not be unlocking a new <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-heirlooms-guide/1100-6495067/\">Heirloom Weapon</a>. Other common rewards for completing Collection Events--like <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-prestige-bloodhound-skin-everything-you-need-to-know/1100-6500308/\">Prestige Skins</a> and occasionally, Heirloom Shards--are also not among the items that can be redeemed for collecting all 24 cosmetics. In fact, no Mythic-tier items are included in this collection whatsoever.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">So what do players get in return for collecting all 24 Celestial Sunrise cosmetic items? A new item bundle containing a unique trio of cosmetics. These items include:</p><ul><li dir=\"ltr\">Crystal Sigil weapon charm (Legendary)</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Happy New Year universal holospray (Legendary)</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Jadeite Retribution reactive Peacekeeper weapon skin (Legendary)</li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\">Historically, reactive skins have only been available by purchasing the current season's premium battle pass and completing it. Each battle pass contains two unique reactive weapon skins for the same weapon. For example, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/apex-legends-season-15-all-eclipse-battle-pass-cosmetics-and-rewards/2900-4432/\">Season 15's Eclipse battle pass</a> contains two reactive Legendary weapon skins for the Charge Rifle: the Laser Eviscerator (unlocked at level 100) and the Cosmic Cannon (unlocked at level 110). Reactive weapon skins evolve, with pieces of the weapon beginning to glow or move as players rack up kills during a match.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">But if you're running short on Apex Coins and Crafting Metals, worry not--the Celestial Sunrise Collection Event also features a free reward track that includes stat trackers for Ash and Octane, a holospray, an Apex Pack, two weapon charms, a series of banner badges, and an R-99 weapon skin. All of the event's cosmetics--both premium and free--are listed below.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Premium Cosmetics</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Celestial Sunrise Collection Event features 24 enchanting new cosmetics--12 Legendary-tier items, and 12 Epic-tier items.

The game brings a whole lot of magic-based mechanics to the table along with a huge open world to explore, so it can be a lot to take in all at once.</p><p>You'll assume the role of Frey Holland, a struggling young New Yorker who gets transported to another world at a point when life gets tough for her. She's just as confused as you are throughout the experience, but we're going to clear a few things up for you ahead of time. The tutorials are timely yet frequent, but they can be easy to miss or skip over when exploration is your main focus.</p><p>Before you take control of Frey to venture out into the mythical world of Athia, there are a few details you should know about. The story starts off in a linear fashion, holding your hand a bit until you're finally let loose into the four major regions that make up Athia. When that happens, you can choose to either follow the main story objectives or take some time to improve Frey's stats and unlock more magical abilities by visiting a few optional points of interest.</p><p>We suggest doing a bit of both to give Frey as many powers as possible, but this list of advice will be useful whether or not you decide to speed through the main storyline.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Change up the game balance</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1775/17752664/4089829-forspokenfiresword.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Forspoken offers a decent amount of freedom when it comes to the difficulty settings. If you're having trouble switching spells in the heat of battle early on, you can change the <span>Spell-Switching Slowdown option in the Game Balance menu to Full Pause, which means you\u2019ll get more time to think about your abilities in combat. </span>By default, switching spells only slows down time for a bit, instead of fully pausing the action. You can also adjust stamina recovery speed, lower or raise the damage received, enable auto-evasion, and more.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Quiet the Cuff</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1775/17752664/4089824-forspokencuff.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Frey and the mysterious Cuff will speak to each other often, whether it be to exchange quips, discuss recent events, or just to fill the silence. There are a few genuinely funny moments, but if you\u2019re not a fan of Cuff\u2019s dialogue with Frey, you can adjust the frequency of these conversations in the Accessibility settings menu. The Minimal option will make it so that only mandatory dialogue is heard, which means you'll only hear from Cuff when his words are related to the plot.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Check the compass often</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1775/17752664/4089825-forspokencuffscan.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Athia's open world is larger than you'd think, and the 3D map can be a bit confusing to understand if you're not looking at it from the correct angle. Thankfully, your talkative wrist accessory can help with that. Use the Cuff Compass by holding Up on the D-Pad if you\u2019re ever unsure of where to go--a trail will point you in the right direction. And open the Journal to switch between tracked objectives. Simply pressing the button also helps, as it scans the immediate area for nearby loot and enemies while also revealing enemy weaknesses.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Manage your stamina</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1775/17752664/4089907-forspokenparkour.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Forspoken's parkour mechanics are arguably its most enjoyable gameplay feature. The parkour system uses a stamina meter that also gets consumed whenever Frey dodges or takes fall damage. It's important to remember that fall damage won't kill you as long as you have stamina left in your meter. Frey will be shaken up and you'll need to wait until her stamina recovers, but she'll be alive. So, don't hold down sprint while running off of any high ledges.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Support, then attack</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1775/17752664/4089828-forspokenfrey%27smagic.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Frey uses three types of magic: Support, Attack, and Surge. Support Magic often provides buffs or passive damage and must recharge after each use. It'll recharge faster if you land hits with Attack Magic, so it\u2019s usually best to start off encounters with Support, then go on the offensive. You can also switch between Support spells when one is on cooldown since all spells have independent timers.</p><p>Surge Magic is essentially an ultimate move that can be used when the Surge meter is full. You'll need to use a mix of Support and Attack moves to fill it up, so remember to stay varied in your combos during combat.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Keep an eye out for Mana Pools</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1775/17752664/4089909-forspokenmana.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>This is a tip that can get lost among the rest of the early-game tutorial messages, but those glowing wisps all over Athia are worth picking up. They're called Mana Pools, and they'll provide free Mana--the currency used to purchase new magic spells. You get Mana for completing quests, leveling up, and clearing points of interest, but Mana Pools are easy to find and they're everywhere. Just run through a pool to pick up the Mana. No need to even stop or press a button.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Refund your magic</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1775/17752664/4089827-forspokenmagicmenurefund.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Frey's skill trees give you access to a wide range of spells, but you won't always like what you purchase. Those little preview clips can be deceiving at times. You can convert bought spells back into Mana, essentially refunding them. This can be done for all the non-mandatory spells that you choose to obtain and the refund is an equal exchange, meaning you won\u2019t lose any Mana if you change your mind about a purchase. Open up the Magic menu and hold the Convert prompt over a spell to get that refund.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Take those Detours</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1775/17752664/4089844-forspokenbard.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Detours are Forspoken's side quests, and new ones appear after most major story beats. Speak to NPCs in Cipal to start and complete their Detours when you can--some quests will become unavailable as the story progresses. There are also special Events in Cipal that should be completed before they disappear. They're marked by question mark icons on the map and usually involve conversations with notable NPCs. The game does a good job of letting you know when irreversible progress is about to be made, so be sure to clear the Detours and Events as they pop up to earn new gear, useful items, and extra experience.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Get good grades</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1775/17752664/4089845-forspokengrading.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Each battle will have a grading system, similar to Devil May Cry and Bayonetta. Aim for high battle grades/rankings to earn more experience and items from each enemy encounter. Attacking enemies from behind for critical hits while avoiding damage will increase your score. Be sure to use the Cuff Scan to find enemy weaknesses and exploit them for extra points as well. Playing on higher difficulties will also make it easier to obtain better grades if you're looking for more of a challenge.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Find the Founts of Blessing</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1775/17752664/4089857-forspokenfountofblessinginside.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Some of Freys' magical abilities need to be found by exploring Athia--you can't buy them with Mana or earn them through story progression. Visit glowing springs called Founts of Blessing to learn these spells. They\u2019re often marked on your map along with other points of interest, so all you need to do is select them on the map and Cuff will show you the way. The Magic menu will also show you exactly where to find these hidden spells, so all you need to do is make the trip and jump in the fount.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Visit Pilgrim's Refuges</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1775/17752664/4089887-forspokenpilgrimrefuge.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Like many open-world games, Forspoken has a fast travel system that requires you to unlock the locations you want to travel to. Pilgrim's Refuges are essentially safe houses, littered throughout Athia. These literal houses act as fast travel points, and should always be entered if you see one nearby. They contain free healing items, beds to restore health, and crafting tables. Belfries also act as fast travel points, so it's a good idea to walk up to those towers to unlock them, too.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Step inside the Locked Labyrinths</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1775/17752664/4089897-forspokenlockedlabyrinth.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Locked Labyrinths are optional mini-dungeons that often contain worthwhile rewards. Complete the challenges inside to learn more lore, gain more Mana, and obtain useful gear for Frey. They\u2019re essentially multi-room combat challenges that end in boss encounters. In our experience, they offer plenty of healing items, so, as long as you\u2019re dealing enough damage, you should be able to outlast the waves of enemies on the way to the bosses.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Upgrade your spells</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1775/17752664/4089898-forspokenspellcraft.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Spells can't be upgraded through conventional means--no items or materials can be used to improve them. Instead, you'll need to complete Spellcraft Challenges to upgrade Frey\u2019s magic. These challenges often task you with using the magic in specific ways, like hitting three enemies at once with a single spell. Complete the tasks to upgrade the spells.</p><p>Early on, you\u2019ll find Spellcraft Challenges in a book as part of a tutorial. This will unlock the bookshelves in Pilgrim Refuges, allowing you to accept these upgrade challenges from any safe house. You can keep track of them through the Magic menu, but only three challenges can be accepted at once, so focus on those, then choose new ones when they\u2019re complete.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Escape the Break</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1775/17752664/4089899-forspokenbreakstorm.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>When caught in a Breakstorm--the large wind storms that turn everything to a shade of blue--focus on finding your way out safely instead of fighting whatever\u2019s inside. Your health will slowly drain and powerful enemies will appear. It\u2019s not worth staying and fighting unless you need to do so to find a point of interest or complete a Spellcraft Challenge. Take shelter in a Pilgrim's Refuge and use the bed to sleep until the storm blows over, unless it's a conveniently-timed, plot-related Breakstorm.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Roll the dice</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1775/17752664/4089908-forspokenpartha.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Once you're able to roam around Cipal, enter the tavern to find a dice-like item called partha sitting next to the bartender. Roll the partha whenever you\u2019re about to engage in combat for extended periods of time. Depending on how you roll it, Frey will get a temporary passive buff. This can be done every once in a while, so be sure to check the map or surrounding area for marked partha to interact with--they're found in several spots across Athia, not just in the Cipal tavern.</p></h3></p><br />", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/videos/forspoken-video-review/2300-6460448/", "title": "Forspoken Video Review", "date_published": "2023-01-24 00:15:00+00:00", "description": "<img height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1352/13527689/4090190-review_forspoken_site.jpg\" width=\"480\" /> Forspoken is visually stimulating and a musical delight, but boring combat, poor characterization, and loose movement mechanics make for a mediocre experience.", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/videos/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-has-bigger-budget-than-witcher-3-dlc-gamespot-news/2300-6460447/", "title": "Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty Has Bigger Budget Than Witcher 3 DLC | GameSpot News", "date_published": "2023-01-24 00:02:00+00:00", "description": "<img height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1352/13527689/4090163-news0123_v0.jpg\" width=\"480\" /> Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s upcoming DLC is getting a lot of money put into it.", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-dead-space-skin-out-now-with-isaac-clarke-and-exclusive-in-game-challenges/1100-6510800/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Fortnite Dead Space Skin Out Now With Isaac Clarke And Exclusive In-Game Challenges", "date_published": "2023-01-24 00:00:00+00:00", "description": "<p>The holidays may be over, but 'tis still the season for new Gaming Legends outfits in <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/\">Fortnite</a>.
