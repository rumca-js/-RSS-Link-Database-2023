In contrast, Mr Trump was required to return all classified material by a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/12/us/politics/justice-department-trump-classified.html\">grand jury subpoena</a>, relating to the potentially unlawful removal and destruction of White House documents. His lawyers <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/13/us/politics/trump-classified-material-fbi.html\">said he had done so</a>. The justice department then spent months trying to resolve the matter before it was obliged to obtain a warrant for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/sep/02/trump-mar-a-lago-search-doj-photos\">search of Mar-a-Lago</a> \u2013 turning up many more classified papers.</p><p>Nonetheless, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/jan/20/joe-biden-donald-trump-and-those-classified-documents-podcast\">discovery of the documents</a> held by Mr Biden \u2013 and especially the drip-drip manner in which they have emerged \u2013 is an embarrassment. The president has been sold on his probity and competence compared to the man who preceded him, and challenged Mr Trump\u2019s carelessness regarding classified material. The distinctions between the cases may well be lost on many voters, particularly given the rightwing media\u2019s expertise in whataboutery. Senior Democrats have been exasperated enough to be <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-politics-united-states-government-merrick-garland-9c875e913618a68ac73d9e41505ab769\">unusually critical</a> of Mr Biden.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/24/the-guardian-view-on-bidens-classified-documents-not-malign-but-a-mistake\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-UK", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/24/usain-bolt-fraud-case-fbi-jamaica", "title": "Jamaican officials turn to FBI to help probe $12.7m fraud targeting Usain Bolt", "date_published": "2023-01-24 18:24:40+00:00", "description": "<ul><li>Jamaica: FBI to help probe massive fraud case targeting Bolt</li><li>Bolt\u2019s attorneys claim athlete\u2019s account is down to $12,000</li></ul><p>Jamaica\u2019s government has turned to the FBI for help as it investigates a massive fraud case involving a private investment firm where $12.7m belonging to renowned sprinter Usain Bolt has gone missing.

Martin McDonagh\u2019s tragicomedy The Banshees Of Inisherin, about two men falling out in a remote island community at the time of the civil war, has a host of nominations: including best picture with McDonagh getting best director and best screenplay nods, best actor for Colin Farrell, best supporting actor(s) for Brendan Gleeson and Barry Keoghan and best supporting actress, for Kerry Condon. In addition to which, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/nov/06/masculinity-can-be-expresssed-in-many-ways-paul-mescal-interview-aftersun\">Paul Mescal</a> gets a best actor nomination for his performance in Charlotte Wells\u2019s beautiful father-daughter drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/21/aftersun-review-beach-holiday-with-paul-mescal-and-daughter-is-a-sunny-delight\">Aftersun</a>; Colm Bair\u00e9ad\u2019s The Quiet Girl is nominated for best international feature and Tom Berkeley and Ross White\u2019s An Irish Goodbye is nominated for best short.<br /><br />Otherwise, there is some unease at the gravitational pull towards the mainstream: an all-male directing list (Charlotte Wells or Marie Kreutzer could have got in there) and Danielle Deadwyler\u2019s excellent performance in Till is ignored in the best actress list. There has been some haughty online dismissal of Ana de Armas\u2019s nomination for her performance as Marilyn Monroe in Andrew Dominik\u2019s condescending psychodrama Blonde (although the problem is surely with the film rather than De Armas), and a mixed response on social media for the estimable Andrea Riseborough\u2019s best actress nomination for the tough indie drama To Leslie, largely due to a wary response to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/18/to-leslie-andrea-riseborough-oscar-campaign\">celebrity-driven viral campaign</a>.

Is it possible to make a film about an abused artist without repeating history?</p><p>It\u2019s only been a week since Sam Taylor-Johnson\u2019s Amy Winehouse biopic Back to Black began filming in London, but the backlash has already come thick and fast. Over the weekend, pictures of Marisa Abela and Eddie Marsan in character as Amy and her father, Mitch Winehouse, made their way on to Twitter. The reaction was one of pure vitriol, with one particularly viral tweet describing the images of Abela, looking cartoonishly distraught in a halloween costume-level approximation of Winehouse\u2019s trademark beehive, as \u201cfucking revolting\u201d: 34,000 likes and 3,500 quote tweets seemed to agree with the sentiment.</p><p>It\u2019s hard to judge a film before even a single frame has been officially released, but it\u2019s understandable that the set photos touched a nerve. In recent years, Winehouse\u2019s troubled life and entirely preventable death have become emblematic of the ways that the entertainment and media industries fail young stars. Winehouse was a hugely talented musician who seemed to be surrounded by people more intent on wringing money from her than protecting her mental or physical health; this July marks 12 years since she died, and in that time, it would seem that the music industry has hardly become a more hospitable place for female musicians. In recent years, many stars of Winehouse\u2019s stature have disclosed similar struggles with drug abuse and disordered eating to those experienced by the singer during her lifetime. Much of her career was a media circus, with tabloids and commentators fixating on her weight, her substance abuse issues and her public meltdowns. The stark images of Abela on set feel like they play into the very same voyeuristic impulses that led to Winehouse\u2019s decline.

This time, Hallett delves into darker territory, as true-crime writer Amanda Bailey has the task of digging into the old case of a cult that persuaded a girl that her baby was the antichrist. The self-styled Angels all killed themselves at the time and the baby went into the care system. But 18 years on, Bailey\u2019s publisher wants her to track the child down because there\u2019s money to be made from their story. \u201cThere are no tragic blondes. Just a wacky cult, four dead, mutilated men and a mystery no one\u2019s had the chance to uncover properly yet. You\u2019ll be the first. Imagine that,\u201d her agent persuades her. Told as if we were opening the safe deposit box that holds Bailey\u2019s documents \u2013 a mix of emails, transcriptions, texts and articles \u2013 this thriller slowly pieces together a story that is very different from the one told in the press at the time.

Then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop26-glasgow-climate-change-conference-2021\">Cop26</a>\u2019s failures ignited his rage.

Large parts of eastern England had simply vanished under the North Sea.\u201d Much of London is underwater. But this is the background to May\u2019s crime story, which opens as young meteorologist Addie finds the body of a man entombed in ice up a mountain. When Glasgow detective Cameron Brodie travels to the isolated location to investigate the murder, he discovers a deadly and far-reaching conspiracy. May has created a chilling, believable near-future where people just like us are dealing with the devastating consequences of the climate crisis. He\u2019s also written an atmospheric locked-room mystery packed with mountainous adventures and dangerous escapes. His anger with the situation occasionally comes across as a bit of a blunt object \u2013 \u201cKolkata, where I was born, is somewhere under the Bay of Bengal these days\u2026 Just don\u2019t get me started on how the world failed to meet its net zero targets,\u201d Brodie is told by his pathologist colleague Sita Roy at one point \u2013 but then again, perhaps it needs to.

Some people find it difficult at first to switch from solo sex to partner sex, so allow him to discover how to without you always leading.
