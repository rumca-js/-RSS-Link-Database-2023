He said that was the only time they had necessary information to work with the commission in order to get a prosecution. &quot;These are not bots that are trying to break into our system, they are trying to impersonate people... putting true fans at a disadvantage,&quot; Berchtold told Blackburn when asked why Live Nation has such a hard time recognizing bots.</p><p>In regards to the BOTS Act, Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal told Berchtold there are already legal options available to the company to go after scalpers using bots to procure tickets.</p><p>&quot;You have unlimited power to go to court,&quot; Blumenthal said. &quot;Your approach seems to be that everyone else is responsible here \u2014 not us.&quot;&nbsp;</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/grand-theft-auto-online-pc-exploit-north-192950887.html?src=rss", "title": "GTA Online PC players hit with game-breaking exploit", "date_published": "2023-01-24 19:29:50+00:00", "description": "<p>A new exploit in the PC version of Grand Theft Auto Online is causing players to lose game progress and in-game currency, with some accounts becoming corrupted or banned.

The agency previously <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-us-justice-department-antitrust-competition-announcement-144344497.html\">sued Google in 2020</a>. At the time, the Justice Department, under Attorney General William Barr, said the company had a monopoly over search and search-related advertising. It also took issue with the terms around Android, which the Justice Department said unfairly advantage Google by forcing manufacturers to preload their devices with the company\u2019s applications and search engine.</p><p>Google faces intense government scrutiny over its hold on the digital advertising market. In 2020, Texas filed a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-texas-antitrust-lawsuit-project-bernanke-165300880.html\">multi-state lawsuit</a> accusing the company of using its &quot;monopolistic power to control&quot; ad pricing. One year later, the European Commission <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/eu-google-antitrust-probe-advertising-115010942.html\">opened a probe</a> into the company\u2019s advertising business, a move that seems to have forced Google to reconsider <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-youtube-ad-platform-concessions-european-union-antitrust-180828678.html\">how it handles ads on YouTube</a>. Last year, the Senate also <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/senate-digital-advertising-bill-google-alphabet-antitrust-192825002.html\">introduced legislation</a> designed to prevent companies like Google from participating in more than one part of the digital advertising ecosystem.</p><p>\u201cHaving inserted itself into all aspects of the digital advertising marketplace, Google has used anticompetitive, exclusionary, and unlawful means to eliminate or severely diminish any threat to its dominance over digital advertising technologies,\u201d the Justice Department says in its most recent complaint. It accuses Google of using acquisitions to take out both \u201cactual or potential\u201d competitors, in addition to abusing its marketplace dominance to prevent publishers and advertisers from using competing products effectively.  \u201cWhenever Google\u2019s customers and competitors responded with innovation that threatened Google\u2019s stranglehold over any one of these ad tech tools, Google\u2019s anticompetitive response has been swift and effective,\u201d the Justice Department alleges.</p><p>One estimate suggests Google controls as much as 26.5 percent of the US digital ads market.

You keep moving, through the lands of Athia, through the adventure, because it\u2019s really fun and satisfying, but also because when you slow down, you start to see the cracks.</p><p>Running on Square Enix\u2019s in-house Luminous Engine (the team that made the game is a newly-formed group called Luminous Productions), <em>Forspoken</em> gives some beautiful moments of magical pyrotechnics, but it\u2019s not quite up to the consistent environmental beauty (and attention to detail) of games like<em> Horizon Forbidden West </em>or<em> Returnal.</em> Still, most of the elemental effects, Frey\u2019s movements and a lot of the world of Athia is beautifully realized.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The matriarchs that control the world, the Tantas, are <em>fearsome</em>, with a fascinating array of spells, lots of intrigue and a great wardrobe. Fighting, talking to and learning about the four leaders and their fall from grace are some of the highlights of <em>Forspoken</em>. Luminous Productions even said that the Tantas were a \u201c<a href=\"https://blog.playstation.com/2021/12/09/a-closer-look-at-forspokens-major-villains-the-tantas/\">labor of love</a>\u201d for the team, and that\u2019s apparent.</p><p>Take Tanta Prav, the water-wielding Tanta of judgment (they all have a handy job title to explain how they\u2019ll probably rough you up): She is <em>delightfully</em> unhinged and argues with herself. Surrounded by her own watery creations, she\u2019s judge, jury and executioner \u2013 except there\u2019s no-one left to judge. Until Frey kills one of her fellow Tantas.</p><figure><img alt=\"Forspoken on PS5\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/e99e3ce0-9bde-11ed-bfff-377dda6830ee\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Square Enix</div></figure><p>Pretty soon after, she\u2019s raving in Frey\u2019s face and you immediately understand that you will have to stop her. The broader story has peaks and troughs, but most of the great moments and set-pieces across the middle-end of the game involve the Tantas\u2019 machinations. Try sneaking (or just rushing) into the castle of the Tanta of Strength, with ballistas firing gobs of fire at you and minions surrounding you even as you dodge the hellfire. Later on, another Tanta pulls you \u2018back\u2019 into New York, and the environment playfully teases that all is not what it seems.</p><figure><img alt=\"Forspoken on PS5\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/e99f2740-9bde-11ed-baff-5b30126f4705\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Square Enix</div></figure><p>While most of the elemental effects, Frey\u2019s movements and a lot of the desolate world of Athia is beautifully realized, other parts aren\u2019t. The only populated region of the game, Cipal, is so underwhelming, relative to the antagonists and their fortresses. Take Auden, Frey\u2019s first friend in Cipal, a city that\u2019s the final bastion of humanity in Athia. She often interacts with Frey in the first and final few chapters of <em>Forspoken</em> \u2013 arguably she has more screen time than all but one of the Tantas. She\u2019s also one of the main sources of information about Athia, why the Tantas are now unhinged despots and well, just how bleak everything is. End of the world aside, why does she look such a mess? Similarly, Tanta Cinta, who\u2019s pivotal to the plot, seemed to be modeled by whoever did the dirty to poor Auden.</p><p>Minor characters are even rougher around the edges. This isn\u2019t just a graphical problem either. It\u2019s obvious where less effort\u2019s been made. Open-world games with low-quality side quests (or game filler) are a regular occurrence \u2013 I\u2019ve given up in the middle of <em>Assassin\u2019s Creed: Valhalla</em> \u2013  but the majority of tasks in <em>Forspoken</em> are just too dull and unrewarding. I\u2019m still chipping away at the game so if there are some pleasant surprises I will update this. But so far, it\u2019s not looking good.</p><p>Following the primary story beats, while the magical parkour skills make dashing across land an effortless, speedy affair \u2013 and definitely faster than horses \u2013 there\u2019s not a lot of impetus to explore <em>too</em> much. One of the major landmarks are giant bird cages indicating locked labyrinths. But so far as I\u2019ve explored, they are simplistic junctions of monsters and corridors, with a sub-boss beastie at the end. Other sidequests \u2013 lots of them \u2013 are just like the fetch quests of <em>Assassin\u2019s Creed, Horizon, Ghost of Tsushima, Spider-Man</em> and well, so many open-world games of the last 10 years.</p><p>Do you enjoy chasing things for collectibles? Welcome to the cat-chasing sidequests. How about doing it without your speedy magical parkour skills? Because that\u2019s the reality\u2013 even when Frey is eventually accepted into the city, you\u2019ll never get to dash across the city of Cipal, and leap up its walls. That means after you\u2019ve traded with collectors, you will have to sprint like a normal human to the tavern. (Weirdly, the sprint button and the magical parkour button are not the same buttons, either.) The good thing is there\u2019s not much to keep you in this town. Even if it\u2019s the only populated area in the game, it\u2019s the least interesting. Take the tavern: During celebrations, you will get to experience the most inconsequential, pointless, real-time event dance-off. The button presses and timings have little or nothing to do with the jigs and the moves Thankfully, it seemed to be a one-off.</p><p><em>Forspoken</em> may offer an open world, but you won\u2019t be able to confront the Tantas outside of the order the plot demands. Don\u2019t worry, the sassy bangle Cuff is around to offer a bit of banter between story beats. It\u2019s a weird relationship between Cuff and Frey: They both seem to dislike each other, but not in an endearing way. Frey may be able to traverse, well, pretty much everything with amazing ease, but despite Square Enix pulling in TV writing talent for <em>Forspoken</em>, there isn\u2019t much depth or even much of a character arc to enjoy. Many major plot points are shoehorned in the final third of the game, and Frey\u2019s sudden mood shifts never seem all that believable.</p><p>Outside of the main campaign, <em>Forspoken</em> offers plenty of opportunities for exploration, but the rewards don\u2019t feel worth the time. When I unlocked a new cloak or accessory, they\u2019d typically be specced way below my current equipment. I\u2019d have to go for another magical 5K run to collect herbs and other materials to upgrade things to a decent level.</p><section><img alt=\"Forspoken on PS5\" class=\"e2ehero-url\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/e989a370-9bde-11ed-afeb-9cef5e4a68d0\" /></section><p>The sheer breadth of magical attacks meant I eventually fell into a pattern of using my favorites \u2013 until I  picked up yet another tree of spells from another fallen Tanta. (It\u2019s a shame you don\u2019t get access to the final set of spells until just before the closing chapters of the game.)</p><p>The battles, when the skills come together and the camera and lock-on mechanism is consistent, are a delight. You shift between support spells, summoning two lava soldiers while raining down water attacks, throwing a reality-shifting charm over a few other enemies so they start tearing each other apart. You line up multiple enemies and cast your super-spell, sending a carpet of poisoned earth spikes across the battlefield.</p><p>Coming across a particularly difficult foe, usually glowing enemies classified as mutants, often meant waiting to unlock a family of elemental attacks that were more effective. Or, simply, a matter of mopping them up on your way back from another part of the map, stronger. The rewards for beating these often never seemed worth the effort of a challenging battle (or remembering to circle back to that location).</p><p>At other times, an invisible enemy would slam into me from behind the camera. The worst fight was during one of the later boss battles with an electric bird beast. It will circle above a city, seemingly forever. Steering Frey, I struggled to land even the most straightforward long-distance attacks. I even made myself dizzy. As the camera continued to swing around and around and around. What should have been a slick showcase for Frey\u2019s agility and parkour talents turned into a war of attrition with bonus motion sickness.</p><p>My quests and exploration would regularly be interrupted by breakstorms, sending a barrage of monsters at you \u2013 monsters that wouldn\u2019t drop loot, sadly. At other times, breakstorms would end if you killed the monsters in specific areas \u2013 or if you bested the super bosses that breakstorms would often spawn. Still working on that challenge, myself.</p><p>A lot of the story lore and worldbuilding is rooted in text snippets you\u2019ll pick up in dungeons or rest spots \u2013 I wish more was communicated through the characters. Without spoiling things, there are other \u2018twists\u2019 that come across as cheap shortcuts, escaping the need for another lavish boss battle.</p><p>The core story will take between 30 and 40 hours, with some diversions. You can explore a handful of new areas post-game, but nothing so far is particularly captivating. I\u2019m avoiding spoilers again, but a wrinkle at the very end of the post-game leads to a very lazy solution for the conclusions of the story, to ensure Frey can still live her best magical life after the credits roll.</p><p><em>Forspoken</em>, running on a PS5, is smooth enough, but it will still buckle under a wave of enemies and enough magical pyrotechnics. Cranking up the graphical fidelity with either ray tracing or 4K makes for a very choppy kind of a game, especially during frenetic battles.</p><p>Like me before the final chapter, <em>Forspoken</em> doesn\u2019t feel quite ready. Originally meant to launch in May 2022, this game\u2019s already been pushed back a good nine months. Could it have done with a little longer?  The main story is intriguing but too short, and the open-world distractions aren\u2019t distracting enough.  At one point, opening a pretty simplistic puzzle treasure chest \u2013 there are lots of them \u2013 Frey exclaims \u201cBoring!\u201d. Same, Frey, same.</p><p>Fortunately, the battle system is solid and fun, offering enough for gamers looking for an adventure, and hard mode is suitably hard enough to stretch anyone looking for a proper challenge. Frey references Alice in Wonderland several times, but after 30 hours the wonder had unfortunately dried up. If you enjoy the combat, however, and there\u2019s a demo to try out, you might forgive the dullness, and be willing to see how deep the rabbit hole goes.</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/lg-cinebeam-hu915qe-review-ust-projector-130042561.html?src=rss", "title": "LG's latest CineBeam ultra short-throw projector is a dream \u2014 if you can afford it", "date_published": "2023-01-24 13:00:42+00:00", "description": "<p>Who wouldn't want a small box that can spit a 120-inch image onto your wall? That's the basic pitch behind 4K ultra short-throw (UST) projectors, which are sometimes called \"Laser TVs.\" They're technically easier to set up than traditional projectors, and unlike large TVs, they don't require a huge footprint. Once you've placed it in front of a screen (or treated wall), you can summon an enormous cinematic image in an instant.</p><p>We've reviewed a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-26-optoma-cinemax-p1-review.html\">few UST projectors</a> over the years, most recently <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/formovie-theater-review-ultra-short-throw-dolby-vision-120040276.html\">Formovie's excellent $3,000 model</a>. Personally, I've been in love with LG's Cinebeam HU85L since we first <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-09-4k-laser-projector-lg-ces-2019.html\">saw it in action in 2019</a>. Sure, it was expensive at over $6,000, but that was far less than the $10,000 earlier models cost (and certainly better than <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2014-01-07-sony-ultra-short-throw-projector.html\">Sony's early eye-watering $30,000 to $40,000 UST projectors</a>). Much like LG's first OLED TVs, the CineBeam represented everything I wanted from the future of home cinema.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Now after spending a few months with the company's latest UST, the CineBeam HU915QE, I'm even more enamored. It's brighter than its predecessor, reaching up to 3,700 lumens with a 2,00,000:1 contrast ratio, which makes it ideal for daytime viewing and HDR content. (Unfortunately, it doesn't support Dolby Vision, a rare feature we were surprised to see on the Formovie UST.) The new CineBeam can also be pushed even closer to your wall with the ability to spit out a 90-inch 4K image from 2.2-inches away, or a 120-inch image from 7.2-inches. I just wish it was cheaper than $5,000 \u2014 with the Formovie unit coming in at thousands less, it's hard to justify LG's premium.</p><p>The HU915QE looks similar to most other UST projectors \u2014 it's just a large rectangular box \u2014 and its design is practically the same as the previous CineBeam. Still, LG gave it enough flair to make it look at home in a classy living room. Its front speaker is covered in cloth, and the entire unit is encased in a solid light gray plastic. (There's also a black model for better nighttime viewing, though that one inexplicably spits out a darker image.) Around back, there are three HDMI ports, 2 USB connections, an optical audio port and Ethernet. It's not exactly heavy, at 26.9 pounds, but you definitely need a wide table or credenza to align it with your screen.</p><figure><img alt=\"LG CineBeam HU915QE front speaker view\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/6f14f0d0-98fb-11ed-a77f-28383ac4995a\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>That setup process, by the way, is more annoying than you'd think. Configuring any projector is a pain, as you'll need to place it in just the right spot to fill your screen. With a traditional long- or short-throw projector, you're often able to shift the lens around manually. But configuring a UST like the CineBeam involves finding the exact height and distance from the screen to make everything look perfect. If it gets nudged by even a millimeter, the image will simply look wrong. That makes USTs less than ideal for homes with small children or overzealous pets. (Also, you don't want kids peeking into the projector lens, as it's bright enough to cause serious eye damage. That\u2019s hard to do with a traditional projector, but far too easy when it\u2019s just sitting on the floor)</p><p>When I tested the previous CineBeam HU85L, it took me a few hours to find the proper position to work alongside my dropdown projector screen. That involved buying a small table and stacking a few wide boxes to get everything aligned. Even then, I couldn't quite get the image to fill every corner of my screen properly. That's when I learned that dropdown screens aren't ideal for UST projectors (Engadget's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-26-optoma-cinemax-p1-review.html\">Steve Dent also found</a> that small creases in dropdown screens could lead to rippled images). Ultimately, I was able to get the older CineBeam to fill around 98 percent of my 120-inch screen, but I gave up on the dream of having the whole thing covered.</p><p>Thankfully, I was able to drop the HU915QE into the exact same spot as the earlier CineBeam. After tweaking the manual focus wheel a bit, it ended up covering the same area of my screen. If you're building your home theater or living room around a UST projector, you'll ideally want to use a tensioned ALR (ambient light rejection) screen. Those are built to block light from everywhere but your projector, which means they'll deliver even better brightness and contrast. If you want to use a UST during the day like a TV, you'll definitely want to push away as much ambient light as possible.</p><section><img alt=\"LG CineBeam HU915QE playing Nope in 4K HDR\" class=\"e2ehero-url\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/6f12f500-98fb-11ed-bbbf-670f0203c471\" /></section><p>While my setup wasn't ideal, the CineBeam HU915QE still delivered most of what I wanted: A large and luscious dose of cinema in my basement screening room. Almost immediately, I noticed that it produced richer and more vibrant colors than the CineBeam HU85L. Colorful films like <em>Thor Ragnarok</em> looked just fine on the previous projector, but the new model delivered a far bolder dose of cosmic psychedelia. The improved contrast also made the HU915QE better suited for dark scenes, like the spooky nighttime sequences in <em>Nope </em>where you\u2019re trying to make out <em>something</em> floating through the clouds.</p><p>The HU915QE is a triple laser projector, relying on red and blue lasers for their respective primary colors, as well as another blue laser shining through a phosphor to create green. That setup works well, but it can only reach 94 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut. Newer UST projectors with three distinct RGB lasers, like the HiSense PX1-Pro, can reach a wider 107 percent of the BT.2020 gamut. Like many other UST units, the HU915QE relies on pixel shifting to achieve a visible 4K resolution. It has a native resolution of 2,716 x 1,528, which is shifted twice to hit 4K. The result is an image that's sharper than cheaper projectors, which typically have 1080p native resolutions with four-phase shifting.</p><p>After spending a few hundred hours watching everything from streaming shows like <em>Midnight Mass</em>, to blockbuster action films like <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em>, I found myself preferring the experience of using the HU915QE compared to trekking out to the theater for many films. And, to be clear, that\u2019s a pretty big deal for a movie lover like me. Even with the COVID-19 pandemic threatening the viability of theaters, I\u2019ve held out hope for a comeback. The strong box office performance of the <em>Top Gun </em>sequel and <em>Avatar: The Way of Water</em> makes me think that there\u2019s still room for the true cinematic experience (though as I write this, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2023/film/news/regal-cinemas-shut-down-theaters-bankruptcy-1235495319/\">Regal is shuttering more locations in the US</a> after its parent company Cineworld declared bankruptcy last September). Those films, as well as the <a href=\"https://variety.com/2023/film/news/regal-cinemas-shut-down-theaters-bankruptcy-1235495319/\">recent <em>Dune </em>adaptation</a>, are so large and bombastic that even a 120-inch home projector can\u2019t fully capture their grandeur. But the HU915QE sure comes close.</p><figure><img alt=\"LG CineBeam HU915QE logo\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/6f156600-98fb-11ed-bfff-8f1e96f6a0b3\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Like most projectors, the CineBeam HU915QE isn\u2019t ideal for gaming thanks to its noticeable input lag. Still, I had a great time playing PS5 titles like <em>God of War Ragnarok</em>, <em>Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart</em> and even the fast-paced <em>Returnal </em>on my giant screen. LG hasn\u2019t issued any latency figures, but <a href=\"https://www.projectorcentral.com/LG-HU915QB-4K-UST-Laser-Projector-Review.htm\">some reviews</a> peg the projector\u2019s input lag between 50ms and 67ms. There\u2019s an auto low-latency mode that cuts off extra processing to speed things up, but you obviously won\u2019t be using this thing for lightning-fast competitive gaming. Based on my experience with the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-odyssey-ark-review-55-inch-gaming-monitor-160004552.html\">55-inch Samsung Odyssey Ark</a>, though, that\u2019s not something you\u2019d want to do on a gigantic display anyway. Twitch gaming requires smaller screens so you can actually focus on all of the super-fast action.</p><p>When it comes to sound, I can\u2019t imagine that anyone buying a $5,000 projector would be relying on built-in speakers, but it may make sense if you just want to avoid extra clutter in your living room. The CineBeam\u2019s 40-watt 2.2 speaker setup sounds good enough for casual viewing \u2013 it\u2019s certainly far better than what you\u2019d get on modern TVs. It\u2019s basically a fairly simple soundbar sitting below the projector, but it delivers clear dialogue and some surprisingly boomy bass. Seriously though, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/how-to-build-a-budget-home-theater-setup-140010399.html\">look into surround sound systems</a> if you\u2019re actually buying this thing. You deserve it.</p><figure><img alt=\"LG CineBeam HU915QE displaying Apple TV 4K home screen\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/6f078350-98fb-11ed-b73d-f606cca37804\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>While I spent most of my time using an Apple TV 4K, the HU915QE is also powered by LG\u2019s WebOS platform, which offers all of the smart TV apps you\u2019d expect. That\u2019s nice to have, especially if you don\u2019t want to juggle multiple remotes, but I\u2019d wager most home theater fans will stick with their set-top box platform of choice. If you\u2019re used to WebOS from LG\u2019s OLED TVs, you\u2019ll feel right at home with this projector. It even uses the same Magic Remote found on LG\u2019s TVs, which has voice controls and (so-so) motion controls.</p><p>As much as I loved the CineBeam HU915QE, it\u2019s not exactly priced competitively against newer entries like the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/formovie-theater-review-ultra-short-throw-dolby-vision-120040276.html\">$3,000 Formovie Theater</a>. Sure, that\u2019s not as bright, but at half the price of the CineBeam, that projector delivers Dolby Vision, great sound and excellent image quality thanks to a modern triple-laser setup. You can easily add in an excellent $2,000 surround sound system to match the CineBeam's price . As for <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-projectors-123004354.html\">other high-end competitors</a>, the HU915QE competes directly with Hisense\u2019s much-lauded L9G, which currently sells for $4,500 to $5,000 depending on the screen you get. Samsung\u2019s Premiere LSP9T triple-laser UST also retailed for $6,500 when it debuted, though it can now be found for around $3,500 at online sellers.</p><p>If you\u2019re an LG loyalist, the CineBeam HU915QE is still a very compelling UST projector.

That's also aided by very slippery aerodynamic profiles.&nbsp;</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-spacex-shares-funded-tesla-private-054933582.html?src=rss", "title": "Elon Musk says his SpaceX shares would've funded his plan to take Tesla private", "date_published": "2023-01-24 05:49:33+00:00", "description": "<p>Elon Musk said he could've sold his SpaceX shares to take Tesla private when he took the witness stand <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-defends-funding-secured-tweets-tesla-shareholder-trial-095159189.html\">again</a> to defend his 2018 &quot;funding secured&quot; tweets in a lawsuit filed by the automaker's shareholders. According to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/23/elon-musk-says-he-would-have-sold-spacex-stock-to-take-tesla-private.html\"><em>CNBC</em></a>, Musk proclaimed: &quot;SpaceX stock alone meant 'funding secured' by itself. It's not that I want to sell SpaceX stock but I could have, and if you look at the Twitter transaction \u2014 that is what I did. I sold Tesla stock to complete the Twitter transaction. And I would have done the same here.&quot; He didn't say how many of his shares he'd have to sell, however, to be able to fund the transaction.&nbsp;</p><p>The plaintiffs' lawsuit is based on Musk's infamous 2018 tweets <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1026872652290379776\">in which he said</a> he was &quot;considering taking Tesla private at $420.&quot; He even said that he already had &quot;[f]unding secured.&quot; Musk <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-defends-funding-secured-tweets-tesla-shareholder-trial-095159189.html\">first took the stand</a> for this particular case last week to defend himself against the plaintiffs' accusations that the tweets he made cost them significant financial losses. Tesla's shares temporarily stopped trading after those tweets and remained volatile in the weeks that followed. He said at the time that just because he tweets something &quot;does not mean people believe it or will act accordingly.&quot;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>This time, Musk reiterated his previous claim that he had an agreement with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund to take Tesla private. He told the court that the country was &quot;unequivocal&quot; in its support of the transaction, which ultimately didn't go through. According to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-23/musk-to-resume-testimony-in-defense-of-his-tweets-at-tesla-trial?sref=10lNAhZ9\"><em>Bloomberg</em></a><em>, </em>the court discussed his communication and eventual falling out with Saudi fund governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan regarding the deal. A text exchange was reportedly presented to the jury, wherein Musk accused Al-Rumayyan of backing out of their handshake agreement. The Saudi official responded that he didn't have sufficient information to be able to commit to the buyout and called Musk's public announcement of their discussions &quot;ill advised.&quot;</p><p>The plaintiffs' lawyer also asked Musk what many of us were probably wondering: If the $420 share price in his tweets was made as a joke in reference to marijuana. Apparently, it wasn't a joke, and he chose it &quot;because it reflected about a 20 percent premium on Tesla's stock price.&quot; Musk is expected to testify again on Tuesday, so we'll likely hear more details about his failed bid to convert Tesla into a private entity.&nbsp;</p><p>As <em>Bloomberg</em> notes, the judge in this case had already determined that his tweets were &quot;objectively false and reckless.&quot; However, the plaintiffs still have to prove that Musk knew his tweets were misleading and that his tweets caused their losses to win the case. Musk and Tesla previously had to pay the Securities and Exchange Commission $20 million each <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-29-elon-musk-settles-with-sec.html\">to settle a separate lawsuit</a> over the same tweets, accusing him of making &quot;false and misleading statements&quot; that could be constituted as fraud. The CEO said on the stand that he told the SEC about SpaceX and that the plaintiffs' lawyer &quot;deliberately exclud[ed] that from jurors.&quot;</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}], "source": {"url": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Engadget"}}
