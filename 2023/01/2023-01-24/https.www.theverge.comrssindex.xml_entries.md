  <p id="epDocX">Another week, another round of layoffs. This time, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/23/23567333/spotify-layoffs-daniel-ek-cost-cutting">it is Spotify</a>. CEO Daniel <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-01-23/an-update-on-january-2023-organizational-changes/">Ek informed employees yesterday morning</a> that the company would be cutting 6 percent of its workforce and said he took “full accountability for the moves that got us here today.” The most high-profile change is the departure of chief content and advertising officer Dawn Ostroff. And while no additional shows have been cut, advertising and business employees, particularly under Podsights and Chartable, were laid off nearly a year after Spotify acquired both companies.</p>

  <p id="gjVxkK">Apple just added support for security keys to secure your Apple ID with its latest iOS and macOS updates, but to actually set up your keys with your account, you’ll need to have at least two security keys on hand, according to <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213154">an Apple support document</a> (<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/24/apple-explains-security-keys-feature/">via <em>MacRumors</em></a>).</p>
<p id="weR8Dv">While that might sound like a bit of an inconvenience, the requirement means that you’ll have a backup in the event that you lose your primary key and won’t be locked out of your account. It’s not an entirely unexpected ask; Google recommends using two security keys with its <a href="https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/faq/">Advanced Protection Program for Google accounts</a>, though the company only requires that you have one security key to enroll. Apple will let you enroll up to six keys to your account.</p>

  <p id="tWhlV9">Google’s facing a lawsuit from the US Department of Justice and eight states over its alleged monopoly on the digital advertising market. The agency accuses the company of abusing “monopoly power” at the disadvantage of websites and advertisers who use other advertising tools, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23584913-google-doj-advertising-lawsuit?responsive=1&amp;title=1">according to a lawsuit filed on Tuesday</a> (PDF). A press conference is scheduled for 2PM ET to announce the lawsuit.</p>
<p id="QYMi3l">“Google’s anticompetitive behavior has raised barriers to entry to artificially high levels, forced key competitors to abandon the market for ad tech tools, dissuaded potential competitors from joining the market, and left Google’s few remaining competitors marginalized and unfairly disadvantaged,” the lawsuit reads. </p>

<p id="dxjL0A">“Fatmap tech will power Strava maps for both free members and subscribers,” Strava spokesperson Brian Bell told <em>The Verge</em>, noting that subscribers will get more maps, discovery, and route planning features.

  <p id="7CJvkn">It’s pretty easy to look at a film title like <em>Aliens Abducted My Parents and Now I Feel Kinda Left Out</em> — which, from now on, I’m just calling <em>Aliens Abducted My Parents</em> — and roll your eyes. It’s just so goofy. (And admittedly makes it <em>really</em> hard to write a headline for.) But it’s also incredibly fitting and does a great job of selling what this movie is all about. Director Jake Van Wagoner’s <em>Aliens Abducted My Parents</em>, which premiered at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/19/23560909/sundance-film-festival-2023-news-trailers-reviews">this year’s Sundance Film Festival</a>, is a lighthearted mashup of a family-friendly caper and coming-of-age tale, one that does <em>just enough</em> weird sci-fi stuff to help it get away with an otherwise formulaic story.</p>

What starts as an escape to a picturesque resort swiftly turns into a bizarre and gruesome game of violence and brutality, with a little existential horror thrown in for good measure. <em>Infinity Pool</em> doesn’t fully explore the elements that kick off its high-concept premise, but it’s worth it to watch two talented actors absolutely lose their shit.</p>

  <p id="kDFmJS">While smartwatch makers like Apple and Samsung are delving into rugged fitness, Garmin is shoring up its advanced health features. Today, the company announced that it’s adding FDA-cleared EKGs to its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22859098/garmin-venu-2-plus-vivomove-sport-smartwatches">Venu 2 Plus</a> smartwatch. </p>
<p id="3v1Exb">The EKG app will allow Venu 2 Plus owners to record a 30-second electrocardiogram to screen for abnormal heart rhythms, which may be an indicator of atrial fibrillation. The results will be available immediately on the watch or can be viewed later in the Garmin Connect app. Venu 2 Plus owners will also be able to create historical EKG reports that can be shared with their doctor. To get the EKG feature, you’ll need to make sure the Venu 2 Plus and Garmin Connect app are updated to versions 10.06 and 4.56,...</p>

  <p id="80xozv">Polestar has given its Polestar 2 EV a facelift, plus some other improvements for model year 2024. The maker of the fastback electric sedan has improved its drivable range (up to 300 miles on a single charge), and added more powerful motors. It’s also introducing a rear-wheel drive model alongside several smaller changes like wireless phone charging and driver awareness features now included as standard.</p>
<p id="s6maAc">The new Polestar 2’s most visible change comes in the form of a new flat front grille design, one that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/12/23398746/polestar-3-electric-suv-ev-range-price-specs">matches the looks</a> of the automaker’s latest Polestar 3 SUV. Polestar calls this new grille the “SmartZone,” which houses components and sensors that are used for the car’s advanced safety and driver assistant features. SmartZone...</p>

  <p id="j0aUFS">Microsoft has started testing a new split-screen feature for Edge that lets you compare two tabs side-by-side. The feature was first discovered by Leopeva64-2 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftEdge/comments/10jo63y/microsoft_is_testing_a_new_split_screen_feature/">on Reddit</a>, and it’s available in an experimental flag in the beta, dev, and canary versions of Microsoft Edge. Once enabled, a new button appears alongside the address bar that lets you split an Edge window into two separate tabs side-by-side.</p>
<p id="lvqqNC">While you can already compare tabs next to each other in Windows by dragging a tab and then using built-in Windows split views to place them side-by-side, it can be fiddly to achieve this unless you drag the tab all the way to the right- or left-hand side of your monitor. This built-in split view in Edge makes it easier in a single click,...</p>

  <p id="EadTmk">In April 2022, Meta released Hand Tracking 2.0, its upgraded system that can detect things like high fives and clapping, but the company is now making 2.0 the default hand tracking technology for Quest apps, <a href="https://developer.oculus.com/blog/hand-tracking-improvements-v2-1/">according to a Friday blog post</a>. Meta announced in September that it would be deprecating 1.0 in April 2023, and it says the shift to 2.0 as the default is a “first step” toward that deprecation.</p>
<p id="musOkm">“Updating to Hand Tracking 2.0 doesn’t require any action from developers, and we believe this change will enhance the quality and capabilities of hand tracking across our app ecosystem,” Meta wrote in the post. “Hand Tracking 2.0 allows you to take full advantage of the many hands-driven interactions available with Interaction SDK.”</p>
