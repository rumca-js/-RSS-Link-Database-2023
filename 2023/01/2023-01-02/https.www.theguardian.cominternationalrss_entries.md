## Wissa and Mbeumo strike as Brentford inflict top-four blow on limp Liverpool

<p>This was a thudding reality check for anyone who thought Liverpool, having dusted themselves down over the winter break, would stroll back into the top four. They were beaten here by a bright, resolute Brentford but also by a shambolic opening night’s work by their own back line that ultimately took the game away. Ibrahima Konaté’s own goal typified that and was followed before half-time by a header from Yoane Wissa, who had already seen two efforts disallowed.</p><p>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s riposte appeared to have shifted the dial but Bryan Mbeumo’s cool late finish, from Brentford’s only significant attack of the second half and resulting from a costly slip by Konaté, completed a chastening evening for Jürgen Klopp. Brentford, unbeaten in six, are in fine form and move up to seventh. Klopp may reflect that Liverpool remain a shadow of themselves.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/02/brentford-liverpool-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Rebel tour has lost momentum heading into 2023 leaving those tempted by the riches promised facing an uncertain future</p><p>It is telling that discussion around Cristiano Ronaldo’s move to the Saudi Arabian league focuses on the player’s inexorable slide towards footballing oblivion. Ronaldo was unveiled at the end of a year in which at least 147 people had been executed in Saudi Arabia, according to the European Saudi Organisation for Human Rights. Ronaldo’s 526 million Instagram and 106 million Twitter followers will now be afforded updates from Al Nassr as football obsessives debate his on-field decline. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/30/cristiano-ronaldo-al-nassr-saudi-arabia">Saudis have bought</a> one of the game’s iconic figures, meaning goals and assists barely matter. Neither does the source of Ronaldo’s weekly wage. Sportswashing works.</p><p>Newcastle United’s charge into the upper echelons of the Premier League and the hero worship afforded to Eddie Howe as a direct consequence will be regarded in the Kingdom as another success story. The Saudi Arabian grand prix is normalised. If Tyson Fury fights Oleksandr Usyk in Saudi Arabia in March, a boxing world will shrug its shoulders.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jan/02/liv-golf-risks-becoming-an-irrelevance-in-growing-saudi-sportswashing-portfolio">Continue reading...</a>

## Antonio Mateu Lahoz plays his cards wrong to make history in Catalan derby | Sid Lowe

<p>The celebrity referee who handed out 17 cards in the Argentina-Netherlands quarter-final came home and went one better</p><p>Barcelona and Espanyol were a quarter of the way into their first game for more than 50 days, La Liga back at last, when referee Antonio Mateu Lahoz was suddenly set off. Urgently heading across the pitch wearing a determined look, triggered by what he heard or perhaps remembering something really important he had to do, he sprinted straight at Xavi Hernández, who was all in black and shouting. This was only ending one way. Pulling up pitchside, he grabbed Barça’s coach. And then he kissed him, whispering in his ear. “He said he was happy to see me,” Xavi revealed later. “And I said: me too.”</p><p>The Barcelona coach was speaking for everyone. Well, sort of. Turns out that the World Cup star who most marked the return of domestic football was the one who doesn’t actually play but doesn’t half perform, the Spaniard who was in Qatar longer than any other. Antonio Mateu Lahoz – Toño to his mates, which he likes to think is everyone – did it again. A record-breaker for clubs and countries, the man whose name has become a verb was <em>mateulahozing</em> once more this weekend. The celebrity referee who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/10/argentina-take-dutch-devilry-beyond-the-bitter-end-in-the-fracas-in-qatar">handed out 17 cards</a> during the Argentina-Netherlands quarter-final came home and immediately went one better, and without the benefit of extra time or penalties. Two matches, 35 cards, two all-time highs, and some show to restart football in Spain.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jan/02/antonio-mateu-lahoz-plays-cards-wrong-catalan-derby-referee-barcelona-espanyol-la-liga">Continue reading...</a>

They achieved immediate success with their debut album, The Pointer Sisters, in 1973, which reached No 13 on the US chart, and their first single, the Allen Toussaint composition <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2U1OUxXSMM">Yes We Can Can</a>, went to No 11.</p><p>They enjoyed further success with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jl26xPdY3IM">How Long (Betcha Got a Chick on the Side)</a>, a Top 20 hit, from the Steppin’ album (1975), and their appearance in the 1976 movie Car Wash propelled their single <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oauHgmINnBM">You Gotta Believe</a> into the R&amp;B Top 20.

<p>With a series win in the bag, injuries to consider and a looming visit to India, the hosts have the freedom, scope and necessity</p><p>Sydney is a place for experiments. Attending your first Mardi Gras parade, fomenting the Rum Rebellion, paying $4m for a dilapidated single-front terrace house: it’s all about opening your eyes with something that you may never have anticipated. There will be experiments for the third Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground this week, then. The Australian men have already won the series against South Africa, so they have the freedom. They are missing two first-choice players through injury, so they have the scope. And they are eyeing a difficult visit to India in a month’s time, so they have the necessity.</p><p>Missing Cameron Green with a broken finger, the first decision is about structure: whether an all-rounder is needed for bowling support. So far in a decent sample size of Green’s 18 Tests, there is nothing compelling in the numbers: when playing alongside him, Patrick Cummins has a small improvement across the key metrics of average, strike rate and economy rate; Josh Hazlewood improves his average and economy rate but worsens his strike rate; while Mitchell Starc is more economical but slips on the wicket-taking measures. The variations are within a small margin for error.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jan/03/australia-have-licence-to-experiment-in-sydney-test-against-south-africa">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Boomers and millennials should wipe the floor with us in gameplay season – and we will never match gen Z’s fine motor skills. But still, we are winners</p><p>Generation Z ask a lot about what life was like in the olden days, and a lot of their questions are stupid. Did we have printers before the internet? How did we arrange to meet our friends before mobiles? We say, “Wow, that’s a stupid question”, and they say, “Imagine being so dumb that you have 15 defunct Instagram accounts because you don’t know how to manage your passwords, even though they’re all the same.” A lot of the evidence is in their corner, to be honest. Not saying they are more intelligent, but that generation does seem to have an intelligence better adapted to the world around it.</p><p>Then it gets to gameplay season: parlour games, word games, European board games, quiz formats and everything charades-adjacent. Never, if they were not all under one roof, would multiple generations see each other’s concentration-face up close. I was playing Codenames with my brother the other day and realised I haven’t seen him thinking since about 1994.

You would think that would be good news for the Philadelphia Eagles, but it was Gardner Minshew who happened to be starting that afternoon.

<p>The arguments against imprisoning children are well established, yet still we lock up those who have been failed</p><p>One morning when I was 14, I met my older brother as he came out of prison. His frame was more filled-out than normal, after a few months of regular meals. We walked into town and he told me he was serious about not going back inside this time. An hour later, on the high street, the police stopped us and searched him. I knew my brother didn’t want me to protest to the officers. If I did, the police might target me too. Even if they didn’t, I would just be left scolded by my own futile indignation. I let my anger sink and waited for it to be over.</p><p>For the past six years <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/19/philosophy-poverty-drugs-kids-young-people">I’ve taught philosophy in prison</a>.

<p>It couldn’t be simpler or more enticing: just melt the butter and turn, turn, turn for the ultimate comfort food</p><p>The other day, I read a long and detailed recipe for ravioli filled with paté-like meat and served with reduced meat glaze. It was so detailed, and in such small handwriting, that – like a novel with many characters and a complex plot – I had to keep doubling back to remind myself what had happened. Recipe and reading felt like hard work. Until the last line, which was like a skip, and suggested that any scraps from the ravioli should be boiled, tossed with butter and parmesan, and eaten by the cook immediately.</p><p>I was sitting at my desk with a hot-water bottle on my lap, and my mouth watered. Not for the ravioli, but for the scraps and offcuts – the<em> </em><em>maltagliati,</em> or “badly cut bits” – some thicker than others, because they had folded or twisted, making them even better collectors of butter and grated parmesan. Sadly, however, eating ravioli scraps immediately involves making ravioli in the first place, and I wasn’t about to do that at 11.45am on a Tuesday (or ever, in the case of this particular recipe), but I did have a polystyrene tray of fresh fettuccine in the freezer (which doesn’t need defrosting), so I put on a pan of water to boil and got out the grater.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/02/fettuccine-butter-parmesan-recipe-rachel-roddy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Noirish tale of small American town, whose upstanding citizens turn out to be homicidal maniacs, features acting as feeble as the plot</p><p>Any minute you spend with this shonky thriller is likely to feel about 60 seconds too long: gone for ever, never to be clawed back. Set in the American south, it’s a noirish murder mystery – even though the whodunnit is let out of the bag after half an hour. What follows is a series of wildly implausible and shockingly acted plot twists as one upstanding citizen after another reveals themselves to be a homicidal monster.</p><p>Cole Hauser plays stockbroker Russ, who has returned to the small town where he grew up after making a packet in the big city. But Russ’s name is mud when half the town sinks their life savings in a dud investment. Then he starts getting threatening calls: “Where will you be the minute you wake up dead?” The only person who doesn’t hate Russ is his nextdoor neighbour Delaine (Jaimie Alexander), a waitress whose heavy black eyeliner is a dead giveaway that she’s trouble. When her father is shot dead, everyone assumes Russ is the target and that the killers got the wrong house.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/02/the-minute-you-wake-up-dead-review-shonky-mystery-lets-the-cat-out-of-the-bag">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Speaking the language has become a global symbol of solidarity with the victims of Vladimir Putin’s aggression </p><p>Last autumn, I started to learn Ukrainian. After a reporting trip to the country, I felt that on my return, I really should try to be less than totally linguistically helpless. The Ukrainian Institute in London <a href="https://ukrainianinstitute.org.uk/language-school/">offers</a> group and individual lessons remotely with highly qualified teachers but, perversely perhaps, I decide I would like to learn from an instructor based in the country itself.

<p>A curiously jaunty account of the bright life of nature a man misses while wrapped up in his own plans</p><p>Along the way<br />He walked that day,<br />Watching shapes that reveries limn,<br />And seldom he<br />Had eyes to see<br />The moment that encompassed him.<br /><br />Bright yellowhammers<br />Made mirthful clamours,<br />And billed long straws with a bustling air,<br />And bearing their load<br />Flew up the road<br />That he followed, alone, without interest there.<br /><br />From bank to ground<br />And over and round<br />They sidled along the adjoining hedge;<br />Sometimes to the gutter<br />Their yellow flutter<br />Would dip from the nearest slatestone ledge.<br /><br />The smooth sea-line<br />With a metal shine,<br />And flashes of white, and a sail thereon,<br />He would also descry<br />With a half-wrapt eye<br />Between the projects he mused upon.<br /><br />Yes, round him were these<br />Earth’s artistries,<br />But specious plans that came to his call<br />Did most engage<br />His pilgrimage,<br />While himself he did not see at all.<br /><br />Dead now as sherds<br />Are the yellow birds,<br />And all that mattered has passed away;<br />Yet God, the Elf,<br />Now shows him that self<br />As he was, and should have been shown, that day.<br /><br />O it would have been good<br />Could he then have stood<br />At a focussed distance, and conned the whole,<br />But now such vision<br />Is mere derision,<br />Nor soothes his body nor saves his soul.<br /><br />Not much, some may<br />Incline to say,<br />To see in him, had it all been seen.<br />Nay! he is aware<br />A thing was there<br />That loomed with an immortal mien.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/02/poem-of-the-week-self-unconscious-by-thomas-hardy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sometimes life becomes a little stale. From upbeat pop to teenage last hurrahs, our critics have the moodboard for forging a fresh path</p><p>If you were a teenager in the 00s, the lyrical triptych of blank page, dirty window and rain on skin is likely to conjure up a deep sense of nostalgia. Popularised internationally as the theme song to teen reality drama The Hills, Natasha Bedingfield’s Unwritten is Here Comes the Sun for the MySpace generation, an anthem of infectious resolve and main character energy that encourages the listener to embrace the joys of their uncertain future. Teens of today would no doubt find it terminally cheesy, but whether you’re rallying yourself to rejoin the gym or committing to self-love after a messy breakup, you can’t deny that it still feels good. <em>Jenessa Williams</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jan/02/cultural-prescription-music-film-art-to-inspire-change">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This darkly comic tale of three hapless and macho males fixes a boldly satirical eye on Korean society</p><p>“It is not enough to succeed,” said Gore Vidal. “Others must fail.” In his darkly funny new book, <em>Artist</em>, the Korean cartoonist <a href="https://drawnandquarterly.com/news/artist-by-yeong-shin-ma/">Yeong-shin Ma</a> puts this notion centre stage, his three male characters jostling for position in a world where the stakes can be so small that sometimes the only satisfaction is in seeing a pal go down in flames. And, yes, this does make it a somewhat toxic read; envy runs through it like poison. But it’s also rather bracing watching these hapless middle-aged men – a musician, a writer and a painter – behave so very badly. The creative life, Ma suggests, is no more noble than any other, and the artist no less prone to pettiness. In other words, be careful what you wish for.</p><p>Ma’s story revolves around three fortysomething friends: Shin Deuk Nyeong is a writer, once a great success but now fading fast; Chun Jongseop is a musician with an irrational loathing of pop trends such as sampling; and Kwak Kyeongsu is a painter who’s about to become crazed on the power he believes he’ll be able to wield as an arts administrator. This scratchy, rivalrous trio like to knock about together, drinking, clubbing and going for “hangover soup”, and when all three are struggling to make a living at the same time, they get on well enough, even if they are far too macho ever to talk properly about their real feelings. But then Chun Jongseop gets an unexpected break, in the form of a lucrative book deal for a memoir of his life as a musician, and things begin to change. While his success goes straight to his head, the other two feel even worse than they did before. When, if ever, will the world pay attention to them?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/02/artist-by-yeong-shin-ma-middle-aged-men-behaving-badly">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A washed-up actor is given another shot at movie-making but the set is being menaced by a fearsome creature in this enjoyably daft comedy romp</p><p>Some amiable inanity and enjoyable daftness is served up here by James Fleet in this British comedy horror romp: he plays Oliver Lawrence, a stage and screen actor of a certain age who was once very big playing a vampire in a string of sub-Hammer shockers. Now that these films have become very big in east Asia, our refined thespian has been prevailed upon to reprise his cheesy fanged demon in a new low-budget film, something undertaken in an uncompromisingly cynical spirit of money-grubbing.</p><p>But the old manor house the producer has rented for the shoot turns out to be menaced by a genuine werewolf – which is generically confusing as well as everything else – and two journalists arriving for a set visit have an awful experience. Oliver loves to regale various baffled crew members with his anecdotes of performing Shakespeare, having a particular fondness for having played Macbeth in a groundbreaking open-air production. He muses: “The critics loved it of course … but then there’s always the threat of rain.” The director confides in him that these films “bought me a new boiler”. “They paid for my hip,” replies Oliver thoughtfully. But later, when Oliver actually confronts the fearsome werewolf in the misty forest, he declaims Macaulay: “How can man die better/Than facing fearful odds?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/02/wolf-manor-review-cheerfully-silly-film-shoot-werewolf-horror">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Moyes’s time is running out, Rashford gives no cause for alarm and Arsenal’s creative genius continues to shine</p><p>If Erling Haaland is the Premier League’s goal machine then its creative genius may well be, with apologies to Kevin De Bruyne, Martin Ødegaard. Come the season’s end, two Norwegians could be competing for individual honours. Placing the captaincy with an artistic playmaker is not usual practice in English football but Mikel Arteta has instead followed the orthodoxy of giving the armband to the team’s best, most important player. At Brighton it was Ødegaard who made the difference against an opponent refusing to be flushed out. His goal may have been a miskick but his pass for Gabriel Martinelli to score Arsenal’s fourth was a beauty. The one-time boy wonder who lost his way at Real Madrid will not be going the same way as previous youthful burnouts like Nii Lamptey, Javier Saviola or Francis Jeffers. At 24, Ødegaard is Arsenal’s jewel. <strong>John Brewin</strong></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/31/brighton-arsenal-premier-league-match-report">Brighton 2-4 Arsenal</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/31/wolves-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report">Wolves 0-1 Manchester United</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/31/manchester-city-everton-premier-league-match-report">Manchester City 1-1 Everton</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/01/tottenham-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report">Tottenham 0-2 Aston Villa</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/01/nottingham-forest-chelsea-premier-league-match-report">Nottingham Forest 1-1 Chelsea</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/30/liverpool-leicester-premier-league-match-report">Liverpool 2-1 Leicester</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/30/west-ham-brentford-premier-league-match-report">West Ham 0-2 Brentford</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/31/newcastle-leeds-premier-league-match-report">Newcastle 0-0 Leeds</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/31/bournemouth-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report">Bournemouth 0-2 Crystal Palace</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/31/fulham-southampton-premier-league-match-report">Fulham 2-1 Southampton</a></em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jan/02/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Worrying cases of Denis Zakaria, Neco Williams and Alireza Beiranvand illustrate the dangers of football’s current protocols</p><p>While he was critical of his own Premier League debut in the wake of Chelsea’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/27/chelsea-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report">win against Bournemouth</a> last Tuesday, the general consensus in post-match musings across the media were that Denis Zakaria had acquitted himself well. More than a little alarming was the fact that few, if any, of those assessing the Switzerland international’s performance at Stamford Bridge seemed to notice that he should almost certainly have been withdrawn from the field of play when the game was only 20 minutes old.</p><p>Helping the hosts defend a corner, Zakaria tracked a run from Kieffer Moore across Chelsea’s penalty area and appeared to whack his head off the Bournemouth striker’s hip as he leaped to challenge for the inswinging delivery to the near post. As Chelsea cleared the ball, Zakaria crumpled to the ground where he lay prone and possibly unconscious for the best part of 90 seconds. Having received treatment from a two-man medical team while his visibly concerned teammates Kepa Arrizabalaga and Kalidou Koulibaly looked on, Zakaria was eventually lifted to his feet looking anything but <em>compos mentis</em>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jan/02/urgent-need-for-temporary-concussion-substitutes-inexplicably-ignored-by-ifab">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A look behind the scenes at one of London’s most celebrated hotels</p><p>Hosting more than 200,000 guests a year, the Hilton hotel on Park Lane is one of London’s landmarks. It was here in 1967 that the Beatles met their guru, the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. A decade later, two people lost their lives and many more were injured when the Hilton was rocked by an IRA bomb, and in 2012, the International Olympic Committee set up residence during the London Games. The first skyscraper hotel to be built in the capital, it will celebrate 60 eventful years this coming April.</p><p>Behind the £1,500-a-night rooms and extravagant banquets is a small army of staff who keep the vast operation going.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jan/02/inside-the-hilton-park-lane-a-photo-essay">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In this striking voyage of discovery, Hooper turns to children’s authors to explain her husband’s leukaemia to their sons</p><p>It’s odd that a writer as talented as Chloe Hooper should be so underrated – or under-read – in this country. Although her debut novel, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/feb/23/fiction.reviews4">A Child’s Book of True Crime</a></em>, was shortlisted for the Orange prize, her work since, largely unregarded, is even better, including the smart, twisty novel <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/25/the-engagement-review">The Engagement</a></em> and two books of reportage, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jan/31/chloe-hooper">The Tall Man</a></em> and <em>The Arsonist</em>.</p><p>So the publication of new work should be cause for fanfares and bouquets, even though the inspiration for this book is not. <em>Bedtime Story</em> is about Hooper’s husband, the writer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/02/looking-into-the-abyss-don-watson-on-facing-his-mortality">Don Watson</a>, and his diagnosis with a rare form of leukaemia in 2018 and specifically about how they can talk to their two young sons about Watson’s possible death.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/02/bedtime-story-by-chloe-hooper-review-humanity-in-extremis">Continue reading...</a>

Taller than Ben Nevis, the UK’s highest mountain, the run, called La Face de Bellevarde, starred in the 1992 Albertville Winter Olympics and has attracted hardcore skiers and off-piste aficionados to Val d’Isère for decades.</p><p>But I’m a ski novice, and thankfully my view of Bellevarde wasn’t from the top of the run.

It was also my first sober vacation with my four best friends from college, a friendship tallying 20 years. I had quit drinking seven months earlier, when the days were short and dark.

From Diwali to Christmas, from Holi to New Year’s Eve or Thanksgiving or Hanukkah or Eid, everyone wants to have a good time, surrounded by friends and family. But are women having a good time, too? Not really. They are busy organising and executing the “good time” because, of course, this is “women’s work” which they “do so well” because it’s a special gift that comes with having a vagina. Right. You know what else comes with that? Anxiety, stress and depression. This constant expectation of nurturing is unnerving.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/jan/02/why-christmas-and-diwali-hanukkah-and-eid-are-cancelled-women-unpaid-care">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Girl with a Flute to hang in the Netherlands as a painting by the Dutch master – but US gallery say it is the work of an associate</p><p>Johannes Vermeer of Delft left behind fewer than 50 paintings when he died aged 43 in 1675. Those that survived have beguiled art lovers for more than a century: intimate domestic scenes, such as a girl reading a letter at an open window, or a maidservant absorbed in pouring milk, bathed in soft, gentle light. As Vermeer’s output was so small, it is an event when a painting is declared to be by his hand. But there are few precedents for a recent tussle over the artist. One painting has been declared definitively “a Vermeer” by one museum, while another has downgraded it.</p><p>In October, the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC announced the results of painstaking research into a work in its collection, long credited to Vermeer. Girl with a Flute was not by Vermeer, but an associate, it said. Less than a month later the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, which is borrowing that painting for a major new Vermeer exhibition in 2023, reached the opposite conclusion about the same work. It was “crystal clear”, the Rijksmuseum said, Girl with a Flute was a Vermeer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jan/02/vermeer-row-authenticity-girl-with-a-flute-painting">Continue reading...</a>

Because I was born this way.” Cue thousands of stitches and duets ripping Martin to pieces.</p><p>I watched the original TikTok video – which has since been deleted, along with his original Phlinmartin account – with a sort of sick fascination.

<p>Kyiv hit by Russian air attack; 45 Iranian-made Shahed drones shot down on first night of the new year, Zelenskiy says</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia+ukraine">See all our Russia-Ukraine war coverage</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Kyiv was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/02/drone-attack-on-kyiv-after-air-alerts-issued-across-eastern-ukraine">hit by an “air attack” early on Monday</a> with debris from a destroyed drone wounding one, the city’s mayor has said. </strong>Air raid sirens were announced just before midnight and explosions were reported in the capital’s northeastern Desnianskiy district with a 19-year-old man taken to hospital. The city military administration reported that 12 aerial targets were shot down by Ukraine’s air defence over Monday night.</p><p><strong>Ukraine’s regional military command in the country’s east said air defence systems destroyed nine Iranian-made Shahed drones</strong> over the Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia regions by the early hours of Monday. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy added that “45 ‘Shaheds’ were shot down on the first night of the year,” in his Monday evening address.</p><p><strong>Ukraine’s most senior defence officials have said they believe Russia will <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/01/new-year-on-ukraines-north-frontline-sumy-region-volunteer-defence-russia">attempt a second invasion from the north </a>in the next couple of months</strong>, using troops who have been training for the past three months since being mobilised in October. But the Ukrainian forces defending the border say the Russians will not be able to break through as they did in February, when the Sumy region had no defensive lines. Both Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, and the commander-in-chief of its armed forces, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, have named February as a possible period for attempted re-invasion.</p><p><strong>Russia has claimed Ukraine’s forces shelled the city of Makiivka and other areas in the Donetsk region of Ukraine</strong> of which it occupies. The Moscow-installed administration of the Donetsk region said on Sunday that at least 25 rockets were fired at the region overnight on New Year’s Eve with reports saying that military quarters were hit, killing many. Daniil Bezsonov, a senior Russian-backed official in the region, said that there was a “massive blow” on a vocational school, which according to preliminary information served as military personnel quarters. “There were dead and wounded, the exact number is still unknown,” Bezsonov said on the Telegram messaging app.</p><p><strong>Zelenskiy said his only wish for Ukrainians for 2023 was for victory as he resolved to stay the course</strong>. “I want to wish all of us one thing – victory,” he said in a video message shortly before midnight on Saturday. Zelenskiy reiterated that he would stay with his people while they were fighting for freedom. “We were told to surrender. We chose a counterattack,” he said. “We are ready to fight for it [freedom]. That’s why each of us is here. I’m here, we are here, you are here, everyone is here. We are all Ukraine.”</p><p><strong>Russia claimed its strikes against Ukraine on New Year’s Eve – including the launch of more than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/31/russia-fighting-to-protect-motherland-vladimir-putin-claims">20 cruise missiles</a> that killed at least three people – were targeting its neighbour’s drone production.</strong> A children’s hospital was among the buildings said to have been hit by Russian shelling. Ukrainian officials claim Russia is deliberately targeting civilians to sow fear.</p><p><strong>Russian leaders issued a series of defiant messages ahead of the new year</strong>. President Vladimir Putin said Russia would “never give in” to the west, and was fighting for its “motherland, truth and justice … so that Russia’s security can be guaranteed”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/02/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-313-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>
