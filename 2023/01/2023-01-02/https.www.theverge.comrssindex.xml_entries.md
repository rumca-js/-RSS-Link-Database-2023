But now that gamers and regulators are worrying Microsoft might keep <em>Call of Duty</em> from appearing on Sony’s PlayStation, Microsoft’s lawyers are suddenly pretending they have no idea why <em>Call of Duty</em> is special. </p>

## Samsung wants Twitch streamers to buy its new oven

  <p id="j2VY0V">Samsung’s Bespoke AI Oven has a trick up its sleeve hinted at by its name: the company says you can put food in it, and it will automatically recognize what you’re asking it to cook, and recommend the appropriate temperature, time, and mode. Part of its smarts even include “burn detection,” <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-unveils-new-bespoke-lineup-for-connected-and-customized-kitchen-experiences-at-ces-2023">according to a press release</a>, with EU models having the ability to warn you that your food is getting overcooked.</p>
<p id="RhaIyX">The in-wall oven can recognize “80 different dishes and ingredients” via an internal camera, though you can also use a 7-inch touchscreen to manually adjust settings and check the status of your cook. The company notes that the European model is capable of recognizing 106 dishes — which, given that it calls out burn detection as...</p>

  <p id="P8qpgu">OLED gaming monitors are everywhere at CES 2023, and Samsung’s lineup is no exception. The company revealed the Odyssey G95SC monitor today, a 49-inch model that it claims is the world’s first 32:9 aspect ratio OLED gaming monitor. It also reminded us that its Odyssey 34-inch G8 QD-OLED monitor that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/31/23330877/samsung-oled-gaming-monitor-odyssey-g8-quantum-dot">debuted in the fall during IFA 2022</a> will be releasing “very soon.” </p>
<p id="ruNz3M">What sets these two models apart from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/15/23509735/lg-ultragear-oled-gaming-monitor-27-45-inch-display-first-look">what LG recently announced</a> is that they use Samsung’s own QD-OLED tech, not LG Display’s latest panels. Below I’ve embedded a sidebar explaining how QD-OLED differs from OLED, but the TL;DR is that it’s able to produce a more contrast-rich picture at higher brightness levels — one of the few limitations of conventional OLED tech.</p>

## Samsung makes Mini LED even bigger with the Odyssey Neo G9

  <p id="R0qz9G">Remember the Samsung Odyssey Ark? Of course you do — it was released last year, had a monstrous 55-inch display that towers over you in portrait mode, and used Mini LED tech. In <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23439332/samsung-odyssey-ark-review">his review</a>, my colleague Cameron Faulkner said that using it “feels like being in VR,” and called its presence “magnetic.” In short, it’s a monitor dialed (literally) so far past 11 that its Multi View mode was barely able to keep up.</p>
<p id="bzvclU">So of course Samsung went and made something even bigger, with even higher-end specs, and is announcing it at CES. Enter the new Odyssey Neo G9 (ignore the fact that new and neo mean the same thing), a follow-up to Samsung’s $2,499 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22815110/lg-c1-48-oled-samsung-odyssey-neo-g9-review-monitor-tv">49-inch Mini LED display of the same name</a>, released in 2021.

<p id="VfNwIW">The ViewFinity S9 will support a wide mix of I/O including HDMI, Thunderbolt 4, USB-C, and DisplayPort. It can charge laptops at up to 96 watts.

  <p id="asNQCw">Apple is raising the price of getting a new battery installed in most iPhones, iPads, and Macs, starting on March 1st. The company made the announcement on the <a href="https://support.apple.com/iphone/repair/battery-replacement">devices</a>’ <a href="https://support.apple.com/ipad/repair">repair</a> <a href="https://support.apple.com/mac/repair">pages</a>, in small text under its price estimators, which <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/01/02/apple-raising-prices-of-battery-replacement-for-older-iphone-models/">was noticed by <em>9to5Mac</em></a>.</p>
<p id="X8ZIbA">How much the price hike is depends on what device you have. For iPhones, it’s simple — Apple’s site says “the out-of-warranty battery service fee will be increased by $20 for all iPhone models prior to iPhone 14.” For phones with a home button, that means the price will be going from $49 to $69, and for Face ID phones that means it’ll be going from $69 to $89. Those prices, by the way, were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/12/17852508/apple-iphone-battery-replacements-higher-price-2018">put in place in 2019</a>, after Apple ran a year-long promotion where you could get a new battery for...</p>
