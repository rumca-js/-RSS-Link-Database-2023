<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/giving-up-on-privacy">old privacy post</a> of mine
recently got a lot of discussion 

<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34173058">on Hacker
News</a>.  It seems people took me to be saying something like:



<p>

</p>

<blockquote>

Other people are foolish to be worried about privacy.  If there's
anything you don't want public it's probably because you're doing
something you shouldn't.  The decrease in privacy over time will be
great for everyone once we adapt to it, and has no downsides.

</blockquote>



<p>

To be clear, this isn't (and wasn't) my view.  There are a lot
of situations in which it makes sense for someone to take careful
steps to preserve various forms of privacy, there are things
people wouldn't want public for very good reasons, and decreasing
privacy has real harms.

</p>

<p>

But I also think it's very risky to rely on privacy. Many ordinary
things we do expose more than we probably expect.  What could someone
infer from the timing of your posts or messages? Background details in
pictures?  Cell tower logs of your movements?

</p>

<p>

One of the major effects of increasing technology has been decreasing
privacy.  Cheap fast computers and storage make many things possible
at massive scale that would have been infeasible before.  For example,
cars have had license plates for a century but it wouldn't have been
practical to use them to build up a detailed record of traffic at
large. Banknotes have (always?) had serial numbers, but people
receiving bills didn't check them, record them, or use them to build
up a record of how cash moves around our society.  People have
(always!) had faces, but looking through the enormous number of
published photos to pick out ones with your face wasn't practical.

</p>

<p>

Another way that technology offers the opportunity for reduced privacy
is that more interactions happen via computer, where they can easily
be logged and categorized.  For example, when I visit a typical web
page, many <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/why-i-work-on-ads">trackers record this
visit</a>, and connect it to other pages I've visited.  Similarly,
most of my communication with others is now via text on computers,
which is quite amenable to automated analysis.

</p>

<p>

I expect this trend to continue: computers are continuing to get
smaller, cheaper, and faster.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)">Transformers</a>
have turned out to be incredibly capable. People building things that
collect and correlate this information are still adapting to the
technology of several years ago, let alone what's still coming out.

</p>

<p>

On the other hand, there are some trends in the other direction.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_law">Privacy
legislation</a>, really taking off with Europe's 2016 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a>
(effective 2018), has made some forms of data collection and
processing require the consent of the people it's about.  I haven't
found great polling on people's level of privacy concerns over time,
but the small amount I have found does <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/232319/facebook-users-privacy-concerns-2011.aspx">show
an increase</a>.  Technology options that make sacrifices for the sake
of user privacy (<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DDG</a>, <a href="https://signal.org/en/">Signal</a>, etc) are growing, though
from a small base (and <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a> is
declining, down to 3% from a peak of 32%).

</p>

<p>

Where does this leave us?  Several thoughts:

</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Despite the changes in sentiment and regulation around privacy,
I don't think a private future is something we can count on. I think
it's more likely than not that systems that can wring a great deal of
meaning out of everything everyone has done publicly are wildly
deployed during our lifetimes, probably within the next ten years.
Hacks, leaks, and blunders that expose information you trusted others
to keep private are also going to be a continuing fact of life,
accelerated by digitization.

</p></li>
<li><p>Since we can't trust the future to keep things private, my
general approach to privacy is still to treat even nominally private
things as if they might become public, and act accordingly.
Habitually making things public is one way to make this a lower
burden, and is one which has some advantages (better feedback from
others, sharing information others can benefit from, etc).

</p></li>
<li><p>Efforts to promote a more private future, through technology or
regulation, <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/effective-altruism-and-everyday-decisions">individual
choice</a> or professional work, may or may not be worth it depending
on how you view the chances of success and the benefits if successful.
I think this is very unlikely to beat work on things like 80k's <a href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/">most pressing
problems</a>, but I expect some people have high enough estimates on
the value of privacy work (ex: risk of <a href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/risks-of-stable-totalitarianism/">stable
totalitarianism</a>, suppression of important but unpopular ideas)
that they'll disagree.

</p></li>
</ul>
