It holds a long asked-for, much appreciated new feature: tabbed browsing in File Explorer. You don&rsquo;t need to keep separate windows open to have multiple folders open anymore! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is it necessary? No. Are heated car seats necessary? No. But once you start using File Explorer tabs, you&rsquo;ll be loath to give them up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&rsquo;re dead simple. Tabs within File Explorer are just like tabs within a browser; a compact way of navigating back and forth without needing to open a separate window. But in File Explorer, you&rsquo;re probably used to opening a folder, using &ldquo;copy&rdquo; or &ldquo;cut&rdquo; to move files from one folder to another, then navigating through the file hierarchy to actually find that folder. That&rsquo;s a pain. Stop doing that!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s the whole point of using the tabbed File Explorer: open up a folder or drive in one tab, and the target folder or drive in another. Then you can go back and forth and simply make sure that you&rsquo;re copying the right files to the right folders. And, of course, you can open other tabs in File Explorer as you see fit at the same time. It&rsquo;s as simple as that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-get-started-with-file-explorer-tabs\">How to get started with File Explorer tabs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>File Explorer tabs are already part of the File Explorer UI, provided that you&rsquo;re running an up-to-date copy of Windows. (You can check Windows Update in the Windows 11 Settings menu to be sure.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To open a new tab, simply navigate to the top of the File Explorer window and click the small &ldquo;+&rdquo; button next to the tab. Voila! A new tab opens. There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any limit to the number of tabs, so you can open as many as you wish.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Windows 11 Tabbed File Explorer\" class=\"wp-image-1430360\" height=\"776\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Tabbed-File-explorer-2.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>The &ldquo;+&rdquo; button opens a new File Explorer tab.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>To close the tab, you can click the small &ldquo;X&rdquo; in the upper-right-hand corner of the tab.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Windows 11 Tabbed File Explorer\" class=\"wp-image-1430361\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Tabbed-file-explorer-3.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Close tabs by clicking the &lsquo;X,&rdquo; as per the normal way of navigating around Windows.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Tabs can of course be dragged around within the File Explorer interface to help navigate around. Unlike a browser, however, you can&rsquo;t drag them out of the current window to create another, separate File Explorer window. You also can&rsquo;t drag a folder up to the navigation bar to create a new tab, yet. (If you <em>want</em> Microsoft to add these new features, remember to <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/414928/now-any-windows-10-user-can-complain-to-microsoft-using-the-feedback-hub.html\">add your request to the Feedback Hub</a> on Windows 10 or Windows 11.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, tabs within File Explorer were <em>not</em> part of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/827065/windows-11-22h2-review-subtle-improvements-but-not-where-it-should.html\">Windows 11 2022 Update (22H2)</a> &mdash; they were added as part of a later separate update. It&rsquo;s all part of the new &ldquo;Moments&rdquo; strategy that Microsoft has implemented to add new features at unexpected times. So if you haven&rsquo;t seen them before, that&rsquo;s fine. But it&rsquo;s worth starting to use them now that you&rsquo;re aware!</p>\n\nWindows</div>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1438544/keychron-k3-pro-keyboard-review.html", "title": "Keychron K3 Pro review: The thin keyboard to beat", "date_published": "2023-01-02 11:30:00+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Reviewing gadgets for a living requires a certain amount of professional detachment and objectivity. Which is why Keychron is really starting to get on my nerves. After initially dismissing the company as another bandwagon jumper on the mechanical keyboard trend, I&rsquo;ve now tried three separate Keychron keyboards in the past year. And all of them are so far ahead of the competition that it&rsquo;s almost unfair.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take this K3 Pro, for example. Keychron took the low-profile, budget design of the K3, and <em>zhuzhed </em>it up with a few of the premium features more often found on its Q series. Not only does this make it a remarkable little board on its own merits, it&rsquo;s among the best low-profile, travel-friendly mechanical boards on the market in terms of value.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See what I mean? Unfair to the competition, unfair to the reviewer. Just unfair. And I mean that in the best way possible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>Note: This review is part of our ongoing roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/414972/best-wireless-keyboards.html\">best wireless keyboards</a>.

That much is obvious, but the upgrades come in some surprising areas. The most obvious is a bump up from ABS plastic keycaps to the more premium PBT plastic, not to mention a shift to a more conventional OEM-style key profile.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Keychron K3 Pro and Logitech MX Keys Mini\" class=\"wp-image-1438546\" height=\"998\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DSC09878.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>The K3 Pro has almost exactly the same layout as the Logitech MX Keys Mini.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If all that sounds like alphabet soup to you, just know that the keycaps feel better and last longer. Underneath them are Gateron&rsquo;s low-profile mechanical switches, which come in red (linear), blue (clicky), or brown (clickly, but not quite so noisy) choices. All are great replicas of their full-sized alternatives, albeit with the obvious reduction in key travel that comes from being shrunken down.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gateron&rsquo;s switches feel a lot better than the Cherry Ultra-Low Profile switches found in the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1357631/corsair-k100-air-wireless-mechanical-keyboard-review.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Corsair K100 Air</a>, but that&rsquo;s not really a fair comparison&mdash;those switches are designed for high-end gaming laptops, and putting them in a separate keyboard is something of a novelty. A better comparison is with the low-profile switches on <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.razer.com/gaming-keyboards/razer-deathstalker-v2&amp;xcust=2-1-1438544-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Razer&rsquo;s new Deathstalker</a>. Gateron&rsquo;s switches have a little less travel, but they&rsquo;re stiffer, resulting in a similar feel. It&rsquo;s six of one, half a dozen of the other&mdash;but if I was forced to choose, I&rsquo;d go with Keychron for the superior keycaps.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"K3 Pro connection and controls\" class=\"wp-image-1438551\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/k3-pro-controls.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Those low-profile parts result in a keyboard just 22mm tall, without the dual-stage feet (a nice touch). Fully extended, it&rsquo;s about 35mm, which is still barely taller than a standard MX switch and keycap. It&rsquo;s easy to throw in a bag, especially with the dedicated off switch. Just don&rsquo;t get it confused with the mode switch that&rsquo;s closer to the edge of the case&mdash;an old design choice that Keychron seems loathe to abandon.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Keychron K3 Pro switches and PCB\" class=\"wp-image-1438549\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DSC09944.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>And the K3 Pro is excellent for traveling. In addition to its Bluetooth wireless and cable backup, the compact 75 percent layout means that it&rsquo;ll go pretty much anywhere a full-sized tablet will, and it&rsquo;ll recharge from the same USB-C cable. It lasted for more than a week with RGB backlighting&mdash;it should go for months if you don&rsquo;t need the light show. I can&rsquo;t say I love the default layout of some of the function keys, especially Delete and Print Screen, but that&rsquo;s easy enough to change.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"keychron-pro-3-programming-tools\">Keychron Pro 3: Programming tools</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The other major advancement over the standard K3 is the addition of programming options. This is a big deal for power users&mdash;and it only becomes a bigger deal when you shrink down your keyboard and force the user to choose which functions need to go on a hidden layer. Like the Q series, the K3 Pro can be programmed with QMK or VIA, two of the standards for the mechanical keyboard enthusiast community.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Keychron K3 programming with Via\" class=\"wp-image-1438550\" height=\"762\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/k3-pro-programming.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I won&rsquo;t lie, even VIA, the more user-friendly option, isn&rsquo;t quite as idiot-proof as something like the programming tools that come with gaming keyboards. It requires putting the keyboard in wired mode, using a web tool, enabling permissions, and uploading a JSON file from Keychron&rsquo;s website. Even then, I had to fiddle around with a lot of settings before the tool would actually recognize the board.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But once things clicked&mdash;sorry&mdash;it became as easy as any other tool, with a straightforward UI and obvious flow. I was able to adjust the few pain points of the loadout and get my media controls on the first layer in just a few minutes. Note that, thanks to all the caps using the same profile, you can move any of the 1&times;1 keycaps around without having to worry about odd row mismatching.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"should-you-buy-a-keychron-pro-3\">Should you buy a Keychron Pro 3?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The K3 Pro comes with other choices in addition to the switch colors. Buyers can opt for standard white backlighting or RGB, both of which can be customized. And you can choose between soldered key switches or hot-swappable.&nbsp;At the moment there are so few options for low-profile switches that I don&rsquo;t see a huge value add for the upgrade, and I&rsquo;ve never seen the point of RGB lighting, so the cheapest model at $94 is the one I&rsquo;d go with. But blinging out the keyboard isn&rsquo;t that expensive either&mdash;both add-on options are just $10, for a maximum price of $114.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Keychron K3 Pro control cluster\" class=\"wp-image-1438562\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/k3-pro-control-cluster.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>And even at its highest price, the price is remarkable. Low-profile keyboards in the same general size range from Apple and Logitech start at about $100. <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/812395/logitech-mx-mechanical-keyboard-review-2.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Logitech wants $150 for the MX Mechanical Mini</a>, with an identical layout, fewer programming options, and no hot-swap switches or RGB lighting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What about the gaming choices? Razer, Logitech, and Corsair all have low-profile tenkeyless boards that are all more than $200 at retail. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07R3CC3HY/&amp;xcust=2-1-1438544-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Cooler Master&rsquo;s SK621</a> seems to be out of production, but its cramped layout is a non-starter for me. (The K3 Pro&rsquo;s Bluetooth isn&rsquo;t great for gaming, but it has 1,000Hz polling in wired mode.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Keychron K3 Pro and accessories \" class=\"wp-image-1438561\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/k3-pro-with-accessories.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>At the moment the only real competition I could find with a similar feature set was the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09KG6MSVH/&amp;xcust=2-1-1438544-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">NuPhy Air75</a>, with the same layout and switch choices, plus a 2.4GHz wireless option. It&rsquo;s $130, which seems fair given its extra connection and more robust case&hellip;but it also lacks the programming options of the K3 Pro.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, Keychron is absolutely killing it versus more mainstream brands in terms of value, even as it moves into more conventional territory with low-profile, travel-friendly designs. With excellent hardware, solid wireless, and a great price, it&rsquo;s the teeny-tiny, low-profile mechanical board to beat.&nbsp;</p>\n\nKeyboards</div>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1443350/this-year-learn-python-while-this-bundle-is-just-30.html", "title": "This year, learn Python while this bundle is just $30", "date_published": "2023-01-02 08:00:00+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Python is one of the world&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.simplilearn.com/best-programming-languages-start-learning-today-article&amp;xcust=2-1-1443350-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">most in-demand programming languages</a>&nbsp;for good reason.
