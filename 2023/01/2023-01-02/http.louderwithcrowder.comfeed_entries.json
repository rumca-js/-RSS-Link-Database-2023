Fighting will get you a demerit. Killing one of the other inmates is still considered murder so that's a no-no. And in England, if you are a female inmate and you misgender a trans inmate, that too could get time ADDED to your sentence.</p><p>So, congratulations to the UK. <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/praying-arrested-silence\" target=\"_blank\">Arresting someone for praying</a> is no longer the dumbest thing we've heard you do in the name of \"justice.\" It's only tied.</p><p>According to <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/10/08/women-prisoners-call-transgender-inmates-face-extra-jail-time/\" target=\"_blank\">The Telegraph</a>, a Justice Minister says women prisoners who call trans inmates by the wrong pronoun could face extra time in jail under \"equality rules.\" Only women prisoners, though. Not unlike when it comes to competing in high school and college sports, you don't hear a lot of biological women who identify as men fighting for their right to be imprisoned with biological men.</p><p>Nuts to the women, though. If a man says he's a woman and is convicted of committing a crime, the criminal can request to <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jk-rowling-scotish-law-activist\" target=\"_blank\">be incarcerated with women who have always been women</a>. </p><blockquote>Female inmates who deliberately call a transgender woman \u201che\u201d or \u201chim\u201d could be punished under rules barring \u201cthreatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour\u201d.<br /><br /> \u201cIncidents where a prisoner uses incorrect pronouns for another prisoner will be considered on a case-by-case basis, in line with the prisoner discipline procedures policy and the prison rules.</blockquote><p>Lord Wolfson, the justice minister, said it will be handled on a case-by-case basis. If you accidentally call a she a he because they used to be a he before they decided they were she, they'll go easy on you. But if an \"independent adjudicator\" determines you misgendered in malice, there will be consequences. </p><p>Potentially, that includes having your sentence extended. Over calling someone the \"wrong\" thing. Calling someone the wrong name gets you jail time in England. Worse, there are leftists in America who don't see a problem with that depending on what they determine the \"wrong\" thing to be.</p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!

It's being reported in a new book that Biden called the secret service agents who claimed to have been bitten by his dog lying liars who lied.</p><p>You had to assume there would be controversy over someone biting the help in the White House. But I think most people assumed it would be Joe Biden doing the biting and not Major Biden. The two were similar. Joe Biden has <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-cbs-news-reporter\" target=\"_self\">exhibited anger issues</a> and <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-gets-in-heated-old-man-argument-with-labor-worker-over-ar-14s\" target=\"_self\">lashed out at people</a> in the past. Major has been known to, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/08/politics/president-joe-biden-white-house-dogs/index.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">per an in-depth report from CNN</a>,<em> \"display agitated behavior on multiple occasions, including jumping, barking, and 'charging' staff and security.\"</em> Also similar to Joe Biden. Just replace \"staff and security\" with <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/watch-joe-biden-gets-gropey-with-another-little-girl\" target=\"_self\">little girls who smell nice</a>. </p><p>Now, according to Chris Whipple's new book <em><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-says-secret-service-lied-about-white-house-dog-bite-incident-claims-agents-are-pro-maga-book\" target=\"_blank\">The Fight of His Life: Inside Joe Biden's White House</a></em>, Biden said someone was lying about Major Biden biting secret service agents eight days in a row.</p><blockquote>While he did not go so far as to claim the bite never happened, the president apparently did not accept the story that the agent was bitten on the second floor of the executive mansion.</blockquote><blockquote>\"Look, the Secret Service are never up here. It didn\u2019t happen,\" Biden reportedly said to a friend.</blockquote><p>Part of the problem, per the book, was the paranoid distrust POTUS had for his secret service agents. The agency was, according to Biden, full of too many white ex-cops from the south who Biden racially profiled as \"MAGA sympathizers.\"<br /></p><p>Major is no longer a part of Biden's family. When they adopted Commander, a younger puppy, the Biden Family claimed experts told them it would be safer for Major \"to live in a quieter environment with family and friends.\" Though those experts did not specify who it would be safer for.</p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!

And offer him $602.50 for his troubles.</p><p>(He ackshually offered it in British money, but since none of you care about British money I did the conversion)</p><p>To the troll's credit, he showed up.

The troll quit after two rounds, saying \"I feel like I should probably go to the hospital\" before apologizing for being a troll. Paddy still gave him $60.25 to get a bite to eat and a pint or two.</p><p>The troll got off easy.
