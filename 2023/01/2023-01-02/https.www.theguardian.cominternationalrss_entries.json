The variations are within a small margin for error.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jan/03/australia-have-licence-to-experiment-in-sydney-test-against-south-africa\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/02/france-hunting-deaths-accidents", "title": "\u2018Not all traditions are good\u2019: lethal accidents deepen French hunting divide", "date_published": "2023-01-02 14:00:17+00:00", "description": "<p>Anti-hunt activists say tragedies are too high a price to pay for one of France\u2019s most popular activities</p><p>On a brisk morning at the \u00c9tang des Regains in Charny-Or\u00e9e-de-Puisaye, shots ring out from the surrounding forest.

As Vermeer\u2019s output was so small, it is an event when a painting is declared to be by his hand. But there are few precedents for a recent tussle over the artist.
