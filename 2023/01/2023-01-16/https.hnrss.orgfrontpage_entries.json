This includes platforms that GitHub Actions don't natively support. It currently supports FreeBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD. OpenBSD can run on x86-64 and ARM64, the other operating systems run on x86-64.<p>Some of the features that are supported include:<p>* Multiple operating system with one single action<p>* Multiple versions of each operating system<p>* Allows to use default shell or Bash shell<p>* Low boot overhead<p>* Fast execution<p>* Runs on both macOS and Linux runners<p>Compared to similar solutions like <a href=\"https://github.com/vmactions/freebsd-vm\">https://github.com/vmactions/freebsd-vm</a>, the boot time is around a fifth and the full execution time for the same job is around half of freebsd-vm (last time I tried).<p>The readme contains more information about how it all works under the hood.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a

I like the company's profile and have a great team, but:\n- I was hired at a lower level than I interviewed for. Was going for a senior dev position, having 10 years of professional exp in the area, but apparently was hired for a mid position. I found out about this only 6 months in.\n- My manager and other people in the management admitted to me I should've been hired as a senior dev. No one till now could explain to me how this happened. \n- Apparently, the company can't adjust my level, because \"the processes won't allow it\".\n- In order to get to the level I was supposed to be hired at, I need two promotions in a row. This will mean I need 1.5-2 years with the company just to get to the senior position (!!!).\n- I keep getting great reviews in the review cycles (not to brag, just to paint the full picture), but it leads to no actual actions being taken by the company: neither in terms of the levels nor in terms of the compensation. All this feels like a pat on the head.\n- The title itself is meh, but it has a very tangible effect now: the company is comparing my salary to mid-level devs (usually having half of my experience) and uses this to justify no or minimal salary increases, in spite of the overachiever reviews and the inflation being at almost 20% in my country.\n- All this leads to me having close to zero motivation and energy left to work here, hence me wasting time by writing this post.\n- This situation left me with a bad taste in my mouth about the industry in general. I feel really disillusioned right now, even though it's not my first company. It's the first one I am so frustrated with.\n- Considering the current job market, I am a bit afraid to just quit. I have enough saved up to survive quite a while without a job and have no family to support, but still, feels like a risky move.\n- At the same time, I really don't have the energy to be jumping through 100 hoops in the interview process once again, at least not for the time being.\n- It might be a chance to give it a shot as an indie dev, I have some ideas I wanted to try out and it's one thing I could get excited about in tech.<p>TL;DR\nI am probably burned out, looking for validation from anonymous people online to make a serious life decision, what could possibly go wrong.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34400961\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34400961</a></p>\n<p>Points: 8</p>\n<p># Comments: 8</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://github.com/approximatelabs/sketch", "title": "Show HN: Sketch \u2013 AI code-writing assistant that understands data content", "date_published": "2023-01-16 13:33:36+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://github.com/approximatelabs/sketch\">https://github.com/approximatelabs/sketch</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34400443\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34400443</a></p>\n<p>Points: 10</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34400435", "title": "Ask HN: When to make the jump to freelance/consultant?", "date_published": "2023-01-16 13:32:23+00:00", "description": "<p>I'm working full time as a data engineer/scientist but I also have one ongoing customer (a previous employer).<p>Another previous employer is launching a startup and has recently pinged me because they need to build a series of data pipelines and ML models for their product.<p>I've to talk to them about specifics but I don't see myselft having enough available time to make it work.<p>I've been thinking about starting my own data/ml services company for a while but I don't really know when to make the jump.
