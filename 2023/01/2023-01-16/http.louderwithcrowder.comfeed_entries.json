A portion of the bill explains, \"person engages in a white supremacy inspired hate crime when white supremacy ideology has motivated the planning, development, preparation, or perpetration of actions that constituted a crime or were undertaken in furtherance of activity that, if effectuated, would have constituted a crime.\"</p><p>It also explains, \"a conspiracy to engage in a white supremacy-inspired hate crime shall be determined to exist between two or more persons\u2014at least one of whom engaged in the planning, development, preparation, or perpetration of a white supremacy inspired hate crime\" and \"at least one of whom published material advancing white supremacy, white supremacist ideology, antagonism based on \u2018replacement theory,\u2019 or hate speech that vilifies or is otherwise directed against any non-White person or group, and such published material,\" if it was \"read, heard, or viewed by a person who engaged in the planning, development, preparation, or perpetration of a white supremacy inspired hate crime.\"</p><p>The bill, however, fails to define white supremacy. Of course. </p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!

They are removing JK Rowling's name from them. Then, they are reselling the books back to suckers who are dumb enough to buy them. For a profit, natch.</p><p>If I have the scam right, Flom buys this, which you can get on Amazon today for $21.50.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"408b2\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32851004&amp;width=980\" />\n</p>\n<p>Flom then not only replaces the covers but REMOVES Rowling's name from the copyright and title pages. The \"artist\" then resells this back to marks for $170.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"7992c\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32851011&amp;width=980\" />\n</p>\n<p>When you factor in that Laur buys all the books second-hand -- <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jk-rowling-royalties\" target=\"_blank\">since JK Rowling has made enough money off of her haters</a> -- that is quite a profit! Especially if Potter fans hate Rowling that much, they can buy the books and rip her name off themselves for a lot less. </p><p>Laur claims eventually the money will be donated to a trans charity. Emphasis on \"eventually.\"</p><p>Unclear is if Laur can name anything transphobic JK Rowling has said. Rowling's haters all <em>know</em> she is a transphobe, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jk-rowling-defies-hater\" target=\"_blank\">but when challenged to name a single transphobic comment</a>, they need to ask for a lifeline. One author even did the research <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jk-rowling-twenty-quotes\" target=\"_blank\">after being assigned \"Rowling is a transphobe\" clickbait</a>. All she discovered was that Rowling makes a lot of sense.</p><p>Shout to Laur Flom, though. I may disagree on a variety of political beliefs, but I'm still an unabashed capitalist. Flom identified an underserved audience and is exploiting them. Don't knock the hustle!</p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!
