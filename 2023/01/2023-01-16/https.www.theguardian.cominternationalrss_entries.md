<p>This desperately moving drama set in a zombie-ravaged US is a phenomenal blend of horror and heart, with a cast that could not be more perfect</p><p>• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/16/the-last-of-us-recap-episode-one-welcome-to-the-mushroom-apocalypse">The Last of Us recap episode one – welcome to the mushroom apocalypse! </a></p><p>What if it wasn’t a flu-like virus that threatened the existence of humankind, but a parasitic fungus that used rising temperatures to evolve and switch hosts, from ants to humans? That is the terrifying premise of The Last of Us (Sky Atlantic), another post-apocalyptic prestige drama in a TV landscape that, for understandable reasons, is stuffed with game-over scenarios. While its zombie skeleton brings immediate comparisons to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/apr/03/walking-dead-glenn-fake-death-amc">The Walking Dead</a>, its beating heart is more in line with last year’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/30/station-eleven-slow-burn-vision-plague-ravaged-planet-bestseller">Station Eleven</a>, with which it shares a surprisingly steady and meditative pace.</p><p>Much has been made of its origins as a video game, in part because the source material looked as if it might offer the best chance yet of a convincing transition from console to screen. The series was adapted by the game’s creator, Neil Druckmann, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/04/chernobyl-finale-review-when-the-dust-settles-it-will-be-considered-a-classic">Chernobyl</a>’s showrunner, Craig Mazin, a combination that suggested it might buck the trend of video games reworked into another format. (Thirty years on, the Super Mario Bros film is still cited as a cautionary tale.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/16/the-last-of-us-review-one-of-the-finest-tv-shows-you-will-see-this-year">Continue reading...</a>

On one side are the climate scientists, policymakers, and representatives of countries most under threat from global heating and of nations that simply “get” the disastrous effects of the climate crisis. On the other side is the fossil-fuel industry.</p><p>The battle has largely been fought under the radar, but it has been going on for some time. And those who fly the fossil-fuel flag are on the brink of victory. The attack began seriously to gain ground at Cop25.

<p>Reinforcements in January could help leaders clinch a first title since 2004 but poor signings risk knocking them off their stride</p><p>A month rarely laden with certainties has one sure thing for Arsenal. When January ends they will be top of the Premier League, with a game in hand over their rivals and the likelihood of a significant points cushion. They are currently the best team in the division by some distance and, when everything is working this smoothly, momentum can feel entirely self-sustaining.</p><p>The manner of their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/15/tottenham-hotspur-arsenal-premier-league-match-report">win at Spurs</a>, which included a first-half showing as capable as anyone will produce all year, reinforced the view that Mikel Arteta is under little pressure to make changes for the campaign’s second half. Arsenal’s consistency of performance is remarkable; results are following and their squad depth is such that the medium-term absence of their star centre-forward, Gabriel Jesus, is barely felt.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/16/stakes-are-high-for-arsenal-as-arteta-decides-whether-to-stick-or-twist">Continue reading...</a>

<ul><li>World No 1 says she feels the expectation in Melbourne</li><li>Swiatek will face Camila Osorio in the second round</li></ul><p>As night fell on Rod Laver Arena during the opening day of competition at the Australian Open, not everything was going Iga Swiatek’s way. Four months after Jule Niemeier had forced her to be down a set and a break at the US Open, the young German was once again causing problems with her varied, unorthodox style. Swiatek struggled to find a rhythm, her errors piled up and Niemeier established a 5-3 second-set lead.</p><p>Yet under pressure, when she truly needed it, Swiatek pounced. First she navigated a tough hold, then she produced a flawless return game to cast aside the break. Swiatek rolled through the final four games of the match, recovering to defeat Niemeier 6-3, 7-5 and move into the second round. Even when far from at her best, the Pole closed off her first win with a statement. “I knew that I could get my focus up a little bit, the intensity a little bit more. So I did that,” she said, shrugging.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/16/iga-swiatek-australian-open-progression-tennis">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The knees-up with old colleagues is like a time machine to the 90s, transporting me to a time when New Labour was new, Covid didn’t exist and I was young</p><p>It was June 1997, politics had been renewed, the world was full of hope and the idea was born in my workplace that everyone should have a ceremonial lunch on Friday 13th. Well, not everyone – only 13 people. This was fine, because realistically 13 is the maximum number of people you are going to like in any office. Originally, it was male-only, but then I went mental – I think I threatened to take the lunch to a tribunal – and after that women were included.</p><p>A few points of clarification. This was Fleet Street in the luxurious 90s (and not the Guardian). The world, especially the newspaper world, was swimming in money. It was not unusual to have to pay contributors with something other than money, because the fee for a single article would tip them into a new tax band. I distinctly remember an editor ducking into a side office to buy two grand’s worth of antiquarian books for some writer called Barry. It could have been Barry Norman, or Barry Humphries, or some completely different Barry, and it may have been three grand, because the other thing about the era was that we were all at lunch constantly, so after noon the details got a bit hazy and all the Barrys merged into one.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/16/ive-been-having-drunken-lunches-on-friday-13th-for-25-years-heres-what-ive-learned">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Run of eight Juventus league wins without conceding was ended emphatically by a dominant 5-1 Napoli win and display</p><p>It took 30 years for Massimiliano Allegri’s career to come full circle. In May 1993, as a young midfielder, he scored the goal that set Pescara on the way to an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/13/napoli-thrash-juventus-serie-a-victor-osimhen">unforgettable 5-1 win over Juventus</a>. The <em>Bianconeri</em> would never concede that many again in Serie A until Allegri, as manager, took them to face Napoli at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona on Friday night.</p><p>The context was very different. Pescara were already relegated in 1993 while Juventus’s minds were on the beach after winning the Uefa Cup a fortnight before. This season, everything is still to play for. Allegri’s team travelled to Naples with aspirations of reopening the title race.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jan/16/massimiliano-allegri-luciani-spalletti-napoli-juventus-serie-a">Continue reading...</a>

Arsenal’s opener came from a penalty after Niamh Charles barged into Caitlin Foord as Foord skated towards the area, with the pair then tangling in the box and falling to the floor. The barge was outside the area but a mishmash of legs was inside. Was it the same incident or two? It is hard to say, and if VAR had been in action it might well have determined there was not enough of an error to intervene. Either way, it shouldn’t have mattered but Arsenal struggled to capitalise on their dominance and creative edge. Jonas Eidevall’s side should have been a goal or two up in the first half, and should have extended their lead in the second, but a lack of cutting edge proved costly and left the lurking Sam Kerr needing only one chance to burst their bubble. <strong>SW</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/16/womens-super-league-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Kit Zauhar’s debut feature takes a knowingly self-absorbed look at generation TikTok as they negotiate the tricky transition into adulthood</p><p>Writer-director-star Kit Zauhar’s debut feature feels like it’s drawing deep on her own experience as a young, biracial woman making tentative attempts “to adult”, to borrow a noun-made-verb coinage popular these days. Zauhar’s protagonist Riley is a final-year philosophy student at a New York City-based university, scheduled to graduate in a matter of weeks. She hasn’t a clue what she’ll do next, but instead of applying for a job or graduate school or even picking up an application for shifts at McDonald’s, she’s throwing herself into partying and hook-ups with random guys.</p><p>Partly the problem is heartbreak: it’s not been long since her last long-term boyfriend (Randall Palmer) chucked her for another woman. The scene where they accidentally meet and end up rowing in the street, aggressively enough for passing strangers to offer help on the assumption that he’s being violent to her, is a finely observed micro comedy-drama of modern manners.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/16/actual-people-review-gen-z-ennui-played-as-comedy-of-modern-manners">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Tertia, 58, and Adam, 57, met at an opera conference in Philadelphia in 1997. They now live together in London with their daughter</p><p>When Tertia was awarded a Churchill fellowship in 1997 to research music education in primary schools, she was delighted. The fund gave her the chance to travel to the US for eight weeks. “As an opera singer, it was a really exciting project,” she says. “There were lots of opera education programmes in the US at the time, which is why I wanted to go there and explore. I began writing to different companies to find out more about their work.”</p><p>As part of her project planning, she contacted Adam, who was the director of education at the San Diego Opera. “I asked him what was on and where I could stay if I visited,” she says. “He was very polite in his response, but didn’t answer my specific questions, which made me think he was a bit of an idiot. I later realised they just had so much on, there wasn’t a specific time for me to go.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/16/how-we-met-she-was-really-intelligent-the-most-beautiful-woman-id-ever-met">Continue reading...</a>

<p>While some Italian biscuits are tough and need to be dunked to soften them, these milk-egg ones make dipping a choice rather than a necessity</p><p>The <a href="https://foursquare.com/v/panificio-passi/4b757510f964a5209f0d2ee3">Passi bakery</a> in Rome is long and quite narrow with terrazzo tiles and an L-shaped, glass-fronted counter. Even on the coldest day, it is warm, and when it rains they strew sawdust on the floor to prevent slipping. The bread is stacked on shelves and in crate-like sections that line the walls. The counter is home to everything else pulled from the ovens in the back: a few typically Roman hot dishes, lengths of pizza and <em>focacce</em>, tarts, cakes, buns and biscotti. <em>Hundreds</em> of biscotti.</p><p>The word <em>biscotto</em>, like biscuit, is a generic word with a Latin root, <em>panis biscoctus</em><em>, </em>which refers to bread (<em>panis</em>) cooked (<em>coctus</em>) twice (<em>bis</em>) in order to make it durable. It is a durable “rusk” that requires dipping in liquid to make it edible. Over the centuries, this rusk evolved and sweetened into hundreds of different forms, some of them twice-cooked, others not, many with new names, others simply <em>biscotti al latte</em> (milk biscuits), <em>biscotti savoiardi</em> (sponge fingers), <em>biscotti regina</em> (small logs covered with sesame seeds). Then there are stout, oval <em>biscotti di Prato</em><em>, </em>from Prato in Tuscany, which are traditionally dipped in sweet wine, and are also known as <em>cantucci</em>, though they have travelled the world as simply <em>biscotti</em>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/16/italian-breakfast-biscuits-recipe-rachel-roddy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Tories have gone from clapping nurses to threatening to sack them. How will that help fix our broken public services?</p><p>Rishi Sunak has gone from clapping nurses to threatening them with the sack. The prime minister’s fresh assault on rights at work comes hurtling into parliament on Monday with proposals to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/10/anti-strike-bill-unveiled-in-commons-but-no-detail-on-minimum-service-levels">impose minimum service levels on workers</a> across England, Scotland and Wales. Ministers would be handed new powers to order compulsory “work notices” to be issued to striking workers<strong>, </strong>who could then be sacked for going on strike<strong>.</strong></p><p>This shoddy, unworkable bill is a grotesque insult to key workers. As a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/feb/17/working-life-union-official-unison">former union official myself</a>, I know first-hand that taking strike action is always a last resort – not only because it involves giving up a day’s pay but because the commitment to being there for the public runs deep. But the goodwill upon which our public services have been running hit breaking point long ago. While ministers seek to foist the responsibility for crumbling services on to the shoulders of those on the frontlines, they ignore the fact that workers and their unions already shoulder responsibility, ensuring <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1112462/transport-strikes-minimum-service-levels-bill-echr-memorandum.pdf">“life and limb”</a> cover <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/05/uk-ministers-announce-anti-strike-legislation">even during industrial action</a>.</p><p>Angela Rayner is deputy leader of the Labour party</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

<p>Victoria Fiore’s poetic doc traces Naples’ cycle of youth imprisonment via four years in the life of mischievous Entoni</p><p>In the winding streets of Naples’s notorious Spanish quarter, haunted by gang violence, a cycle of incarceration grinds on. Entoni, a mischievous, charismatic force of nature who likes to get into trouble, exasperates his grandmother Dora and mother Natalia. Victoria Fiore’s shattering documentary observes him over four years as he grows, witnessing how his adolescent rebellion results in a forced stay at a reform facility and later youth prison.</p><p>Instead of the realist style often employed in social-issue documentaries, Fiore lends a dose of poetry to the depiction of Entoni’s everyday life. The pleasures of a summer swim, or aimlessly hanging out with a best friend, are beautifully conjured. The fleetingness of these experiences becomes heartbreaking when, charged with setting fire to a car, Entoni is sent to a home for troubled children as the government cracks down on crime. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/16/hide-and-seek-review-victoria-fiore">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Before this season, the New York Giants QB was best known for tripping over his own feet. Now he is a formidable dual threat</p><p>The NFL boasts quarterbacks with signature styles. There’s Patrick Mahomes and his bag of tricks. Joe Burrow oozing with confidence on the field while <a href="https://www.cincinnati.com/story/entertainment/2023/01/14/joe-burrow-fashion-best-outfits-from-cincinnati-bengals-2022-season/69798629007/">donning fur and smoking stogies off it</a>. Lamar Jackson, the ultimate offensive threat. Then there’s Daniel Jones who doesn’t look like anything remarkable, has almost no swagger, and prior to this season was best known as the guy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRsnQL-zw44">who tripped over himself</a> on an 80-yard run during the 2020 season.</p><p>That was then. This is now. Jones showed glimpses of his talent before Brian Daboll arrived as head coach of the New York Giants. With limited offensive help, Jones put up 400 yards and shepherded a comeback win over the Saints in 2021, he’s dominated Washington, and that run in which he stumbled over himself … it had a top speed of 21.23mph, one of the fastest for any quarterback in history. But Jones also made a number of mistakes and collected too many losses in his first few years in New York. The Giants declined Jones’s fifth-year option, and his future had been talkshow fodder in the Big Apple.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/16/daniel-jones-new-york-giants-quarterback-nfl-playoffs-football-vikings">Continue reading...</a>

<p>La Liga president’s battle to rein in spending is on soft ground because England’s top flight is still on a firm financial footing</p><p>There is a telling moment in Apple TV+’s punchy new documentary, Super League: the War for Football, in which the head of La Liga, Javier Tebas, gives a withering assessment of those who seek to control the modern game. “You have to keep up the fight,” he growls. “Money is not everything. Far from it. The rich don’t have the same ethical standards. There’s lots of liars and fakes. Betrayals happen all the time. Loyalty is practically nonexistent. I’ve never trusted anyone.”</p><p>Tebas has a lawyer’s mind and a pugilist’s love of a ruck. It is a healthy combination, and football is the better for it. Without him, as well as the Uefa president, Aleksander Ceferin, and Paris Saint-Germain’s president, Nasser al-Khelaifi, the European Super League might well have become a reality. Now, however, he has a fresh target in his crosshairs: the Premier League.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jan/16/javier-tebas-premier-league-spending-la-liga">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Cindy Sherman said, I love these’: ex-Beta Band star John Maclean on his paintings

<p>After late 90s indie success and a film collaboration with Michael Fassbender, Maclean embraced painting during the pandemic. His first show sold out – but don’t rule out a Beta Band reunion</p><p>It was a nail that started it all. “I wanted a painting to hang on it,” says John Maclean, former keyboard player with the Beta Band and award-winning film director. He nods towards a wall in his home studio in London where the lonely piece of metal still protrudes. Maclean has found it difficult to fulfil his mission: at first, because he wasn’t entirely happy with the paintings he was producing; more recently, because people keep buying them.</p><p>Becoming a professional artist at the age of 50 was not intentional. Like a lot of people, Maclean found himself painting during the pandemic just for something to do. At the time, he was casting for his second film – a follow-up to 2015’s Sundance-winning western <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/25/slow-west-review-michael-fassbender-kodi-smit-mcphee-john-maclean">Slow West</a> – when everything ground to a halt. He sourced some old postcards on eBay, zoomed in on peripheral parts of the landscape that caught his eye (a tree, a waterfall) and tried to replicate them – applying the paint thickly (you wouldn’t guess they were watercolours) on to wooden panels using a psychedelic palette reminiscent of Hockney’s iPad spring paintings. Today, Maclean has arranged several on the floor in front of us, disconcertingly nudging them around with his feet as we talk. “Ah well,” he says, giving one a boot. “They’re made of wood.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/16/cindy-sherman-said-i-love-these-ex-beta-band-star-john-maclean-on-his-paintings">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Mykhaylo Mudryk might not be a huge loss for Arsenal, Everton’s decline looks terminal and Moyes’s is time is running out</p><p>When Arsenal were as rhapsodic as in their first half at Tottenham, it was tempting to wonder just where Mykhaylo Mudryk might have fitted in. In Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli, Mikel Arteta already has the Premier League’s most potent wingers. Would it have been worth lashing out next year’s transfer budget and break wage structures for a player not guaranteed to start? Instead, the Ukrainian takes up his lengthy, lucrative new contract at Chelsea. That Gabriel Jesus’s injury will keep him out longer than hoped must also have altered strategic thinking. Finding a player who can replace the Brazilian will be exacting, and while Eddie Nketiah continues to shimmer, working devilishly across the front at Tottenham, a lack of further centre-forward options points to Arsenal’s primacy being a result of their having the best first XI in the Premier League rather than the deepest squad. Quality reinforcements could still come in rather handy. <strong>John Brewin</strong></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/15/tottenham-hotspur-arsenal-premier-league-match-report">Tottenham 0-2 Arsenal</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/14/manchester-united-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report">Manchester United 2-1 Manchester City</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/14/everton-southampton-premier-league-match-report">Everton 1-2 Southampton</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/14/wolves-west-ham-premier-league-match-report">Wolves 1-0 West Ham</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/14/brighton-liverpool-premier-league-match-report">Brighton 3-0 Liverpool</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/15/chelsea-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report">Chelsea 1-0 Crystal Palace</a></em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/16/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Harry Crews’s unsparing portrait of his often brutal upbringing in 1930s Georgia is a window into a lost world</p><p>If a cult writer’s aura endures long enough, their work might be elevated to Penguin Classics status. At leas, that’s what’s happened to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/10/harry-crews">Harry Crews</a>, the author of many southern gothic novels populated by freaks and grotesques, including his most well-known novel, <em>A Feast of Snakes</em>. Born in Georgia in 1935, Crews died in 2012 and claimed to have sold only a few thousand books in hardback during his lifetime (a series of celebrity admirers including Sean Penn and Madonna failed to translate into mainstream popularity). Having published eight novels in as many years, beginning with <em>The Gospel Singer </em>in 1968, in his 40s Crews turned to nonfiction to recount his first six years alive and testify to “a way of life gone forever out of the world”. His memoir <em>A Childhood: The Biography of a Place </em>was first published in 1978 and is now reissued (along with <em>The Gospel Singer</em>)<em> </em>with a loving foreword by Tobias Wolff. In the US, there has been a corresponding surge of enthusiasm for Crews and his work, with the<em> New Yorker </em>recently describing <em>A Childhood </em>as “one of the finest memoirs ever written by an American”.</p><p>Childhood memoirs (and novels) face a formal difficulty relating to the essence of childhood itself: if you’ve seen one, you’ve seen them all. Whereas adult life, differentiated by profession, sexual career and cumulative experience is infinitely diverse, all childhoods are basically alike – which is why the subtitle to Crews’s book is crucial. Bacon County, Georgia, in the 1920s and 30s is depicted as a violent, pre-modern backwater of poverty and squalor inhabited by the variably disfigured: scars, missing fingers, chewed-up ears and mangled extremities are more common than wholeness. Harry and his friends pore over the Sears, Roebuck catalogue in wonderment at how “all the people in its pages were perfect”, though he “had known for a long time that it was all a lie” and there surely couldn’t be a way to live in this world without mutilations.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/16/a-childhood-the-biography-of-a-place-review-a-classic-of-the-deep-south">Continue reading...</a>

She had been a journalist in Malaysia, but moved to the UK in the 80s, where she had a difficult, short-lived marriage.

<p>Despite glowing reviews, Todd Field’s drama about a predatory conductor has struggled at the box office. Is this because its protagonist is an unlikeable woman?</p><p>Punters probably don’t need another reason to skip Tár, Todd Field’s much-discussed tale of a feted conductor who becomes a lightning rod for the #MeToo movement, but Marin Alsop was happy to oblige nonetheless. Tár, the US conductor told the Sunday Times, was “anti-woman” and a personal affront. The film could have told the story of a rapacious male monster, but chose instead to make its lead a female conductor. “To have an opportunity to portray a woman in that role and to make her an abuser,” Alsop said. “For me, that was heartbreaking.”</p><p>In Alsop’s view, then, Tár is a tragic missed opportunity. She wanted one kind of protagonist and wound up with another, in the same way that Jaws might have been a film about a dog or GoodFellas an account of New Jersey samaritans. Some movies are like that. They confound and confuse and upend our expectations. In this respect, at their finest, they are a little like life.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/16/monstrous-maestro-cate-blanchett-cancel-culture-tar">Continue reading...</a>

But everyone has five minutes: it’s about a <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/internet-3/83183/netflix-users-waste-ton-of-time-searching-for-something-to-watch">third as long</a> as people spend looking for something to watch on Netflix.

<p>The horror movie’s hi-tech star may be fiction, but concerns over the human relationship with AI are real</p><p>The horror film <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/09/m3gan-evil-doll-horror-m3gan-deeper-issues">M3gan</a> – and its namesake demon doll – has charmed critics and packed movie theaters, earning $30.4mon its <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/m3gan-box-office-horror-1235293870/">opening weekend</a>. The film’s trailer, which went viral last fall for a scene which shows the robot pausing, mid-kill, to try out a TikTok dance, proved that M3gan is a villain made for memes. But it’s not all bloodthirsty fun: the movie raises questions about parenting and digitized playtime.</p><p>A quick summary, with light spoilers: M3gan is a robot doll who can do just about anything (walk, talk, twerk, murder). She’s created by Gemma (Allison Williams), a work-obsessed roboticist who suddenly has to care for her orphaned niece Cady. At first, M3gan is a hit: Gemma’s bosses at a Hasbro-esque toy company tout her as the Tesla of dolls. She and Cady become inseparable. Then M3gan gets too smart. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/16/megan-film-robot-ai-ethics-real-life">Continue reading...</a>

## Will the UK’s strict new voter ID laws damage democracy?

<p>For the first time, voters in May’s local elections will be required to show photo ID before casting their ballot. But as Peter Walker reports, the new rules risk damaging the integrity of elections, not enhancing it</p><p>During the back end of a political year of barely contained mayhem, the government released – with little fanfare – the latest details on its new voter ID laws. Gone are the days when you could stroll into a polling station, give your name and address and then receive a ballot. From May, everyone intending to vote in person will have to prove who they say they are with one of a limited range of acceptable ID.</p><p>The Guardian’s political correspondent <strong>Peter Walker</strong> tells <strong>Nosheen Iqbal </strong>that this delivers on a promise laid out in a previous Tory manifesto, but comes with barely any explanation of why it is necessary. While Northern Ireland already requires it, voter impersonation fraud is barely detectable in the rest of the UK. It has led to opposition parties accusing the government of cynical US-style ‘voter suppression’ tactics: young and marginalised people (who are least likely to back the Tories) will be most likely to struggle with the new rules.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/audio/2023/jan/16/will-the-uks-strict-new-voter-id-laws-damage-democracy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Death toll from Russian missile attack on Dnipro rises to 30; Vladimir Putin claims war on Ukraine is developing according to plan</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">See all our Russia-Ukraine war coverage</a></li></ul><p><strong>The number of people killed in a Russian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/14/russia-carries-out-two-mass-rocket-strikes-on-ukraine-killing-at-least-five-people">missile attack on a residential block in Dnipro</a> has<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2023/jan/15/rescuers-dig-through-rubble-of-apartment-building-in-ukraine-hit-by-missile-attack-video"> risen to 30</a></strong>, according to Ukrainian officials. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his latest <a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/vidpovidalnist-za-teror-bude-dlya-vsih-i-dlya-tih-hto-vbivay-80385">address</a> that “the list of the dead includes 30 people, including one child – a girl, she was 15 years old”. At least 73 people were wounded and 39 people had been rescued as of Sunday afternoon. The city government in Dnipro said 43 people were still reported missing. “The chances of saving people now are minimal,” Dnipro’s mayor, Borys Filatov, told Reuters. I think the number of dead will be in the dozens.”</p><p>Claiming responsibility for the missile strikes across Ukraine, <strong>Russia’s defence ministry said on Sunday that it achieved its goal. </strong>A ministry statement posted on Telegram said: “All designated targets have been hit. The goal of the attack has been achieved.” However, it did not mention the attack on the Dnipro residential building.</p><p><strong>President Vladimir Putin has told Russian state television that what he calls the “special military operation” in Ukraine has gained positive momentum.</strong> “The dynamic is positive,” he told Rossiya 1 state television. “Everything is developing within the framework of the plan of the ministry of defence and the general staff.” Putin said he hoped soldiers would deliver more wins after Russia claimed control of the eastern Ukrainian salt-mining town of Soledar – a claim disputed by Kyiv.</p><p><strong>Battle tanks from German industrial reserves wanted by Ukraine will <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/15/german-battle-tanks-for-ukraine-wont-be-ready-until-2024">not be ready to be delivered until 2024</a>.</strong> The warning from arms manufacturer Rheinmetall will dampen Kyiv’s hopes that the UK’s promise to deliver Challenger 2 tanks would encourage other European nations to swiftly follow suit. “Even if the decision to send our Leopard tanks to Kyiv came tomorrow, the delivery would take until the start of next year,” Rheinmetall’s chief executive, Armin Papperger, told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper.</p><p><strong>The UK prime minister has confirmed the country will provide <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/14/rishi-sunak-offers-tanks-ukraine-russian-troops-challenger-2-volodymyr-zelenskiy">14 of its Challenger 2 main battle tanks</a> and other advanced artillery support to Ukraine in the coming weeks</strong>. Downing Street said Rishi Sunak made the pledge during a call on Saturday morning with Volodymyr Zelenskiy as a sign of the UK’s “ambition to intensify our support to Ukraine”. Russia’s embassy in Britain said the move would only “intensify” the conflict.</p><p><strong>The UK foreign secretary has said “now is the time to accelerate and go further and faster” in giving Ukraine the support it needs.</strong> In a<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21047335/james-cleverly-ukraine-tanks-win-war-russia/"> column for British tabloid the Sun on Sunday</a>, James Cleverly writes that the Russian army is on the defensive and morale among its troops is pitiful, blaming the “shambolic state of Russian military logistics”.</p><p><strong>Nato’s secretary general said Ukraine could expect more deliveries of heavy weapons from western countries soon</strong>. “The recent pledges for heavy warfare equipment are important – and I expect more in the near future,” Jens Stoltenberg told Germany’s Handelsblatt daily on Sunday. Western allies will consider sending battle tanks to Kyiv ahead of a meeting in Ramstein in Germany next Friday where governments are expected to announce their latest pledges of military support.</p><p><strong>Belarus’s security council said on Sunday that joint air force drills with Russia, due to start on Monday, were purely defensive in nature</strong> and would focus on reconnaissance missions and how to thwart a potential attack. “The exercise is purely defensive in nature,” said Pavel Muraveyko, first deputy state secretary of the Belarusian security council, according to a post on the Belarusian defence ministry’s Telegram app on Sunday. “It will be a set of measures to prepare our and Russian aviation to carry out the relevant combat missions.”<strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jan/15/russia-ukraine-war-live-rescuers-work-though-night-after-deadly-russian-missile-attack-on-dnipro-apartment-block?page=with:block-63c444018f08fa7950d4e58f#block-63c444018f08fa7950d4e58f"><br /></a></strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/16/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-327-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>
