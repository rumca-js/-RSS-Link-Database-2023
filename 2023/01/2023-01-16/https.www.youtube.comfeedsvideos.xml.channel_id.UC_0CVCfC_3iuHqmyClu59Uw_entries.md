This is the fastest android device we have ever tested and for good reason, The Red Magic 8 Pro Plus is powered by the all-new Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 and it can run and play any game or emulator plus this android phone has a console mode! In this video, we unbox and test the Red Magic 8 Pro + by running benchmarks, testing native android games like Genshin impact and of course, see how it handles emulators like Dolphin for GameCube and Wii, Citra for 3ds on android, Aethersx2 for PS2 emulation and SKyline the android switch emulator!
