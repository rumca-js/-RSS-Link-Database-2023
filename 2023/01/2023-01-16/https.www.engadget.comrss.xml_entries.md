<p>Apple might not wait long to unveil its first products of 2023. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1615052883715850240">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/01/16/new-mac-updates-coming-this-week-rumor/"><em>9to5Mac</em></a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/16/apple-product-announcement-tomorrow/"><em>MacRumors</em></a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/frontpagetech/status/1615008571246403585"><em>Front Page Tech</em></a> (aka Jon Prosser) all claim Apple will have a product announcement tomorrow. While most aren't clear on details, Gurman hints these may be the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-m2-macbook-pro-report-165922146.html">14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro M2</a> models he discussed last fall.</p><p>At the time, Gurman said these systems would share the same design as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-book-pro-14-16-inch-review-2021-apple-mighty-macs-130011975.html">M1 variants</a> released in late 2021. They would center around new M2 Pro and M2 Max chips that would feature up to 12 CPU cores and 38 GPU cores in the Max. There wouldn't be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-touchscreen-macbook-pro-232631704.html">a touchscreen</a> or other major revisions, in other words. You'd mainly buy one to get the best performance possible from a Mac laptop.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="0ade717244054c129ba25d3ed6cae5ff"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">The new MacBook Pros are imminent (Apple does have an announcement tomorrow - with press briefings later this week and embargoes lifting next Monday).

## High-powered lasers can be used to steer lightning strikes

<p>Lightning rods have been used to safely guide strikes into the ground since Benjamin Franklin's day, but their short range (roughly the same radius as the height) and fixed-in-place design makes them ineffective for protecting large areas. The technology may finally be here to replace them in some situations. European researchers have successfully <a href="https://www.unige.ch/communication/communiques/en/2023/devier-la-foudre-grace-au-paratonnerre-laser">tested</a> a system that uses terawatt-level laser pulses to steer lighting toward a 26-foot rod. It's not limited by its physical height, and can cover much wider areas — in this case, 590 feet — while penetrating clouds and fog.</p><p>The design ionizes nitrogen and oxygen molecules, releasing electrons and creating a plasma that conducts electricity. As the laser fires at a very quick 1,000 pulses per second, it's considerably more likely to intercept lightning as it forms. In the test, conducted between June and September 2021, lightning followed the beam for nearly 197 feet before hitting the rod.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="ba264a20507c43f7bfc83be4d247c469"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>Researchers have been exploring laser lightning guides <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c6c965be-a8ea-473d-89f4-9754f2675a60&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nature+Research&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjNmM5NjViZS1hOGVhLTQ3M2QtODlmNC05NzU0ZjI2NzVhNjAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmF0dXJlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9ucGhvdG9uLjIwMDkuOSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNGYxZDBlOTItYzQ5OC00NDJiLWFmOWMtY2ZjMjYzNTRkZmY1In0&amp;signature=AQAAAcOwF-3jV0caX0hruOI5OXwgnMKTSh9Yj8wZBMGb73_C&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fnphoton.2009.9">for years</a>. However, experiments have typically been limited to much shorter distances and relatively slow pulses that were more likely to miss lighting as it formed. Dr. Aurélien Houard, who helped lead the project, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53c2ouY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2xhc2Vycy1jYW4tZ3VpZGUtZGFuZ2Vyb3VzLWxpZ2h0bmluZy1zdHJpa2VzLXRvLWEtc2FmZXItcGF0aC1zdHVkeS1zaG93cy0xMTY3Mzg4NDgyOSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNGYxZDBlOTItYzQ5OC00NDJiLWFmOWMtY2ZjMjYzNTRkZmY1In0&amp;signature=AQAAASdkiZSOXZEP50OwDU1bZL38W6rd7w0pxmrPLwoXSeI6&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Flasers-can-guide-dangerous-lightning-strikes-to-a-safer-path-study-shows-11673884829">told</a> the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> that this laser shot 100 times more pulses per second than in previous attempts.</p><p>It could be a long while before lasers are used beyond experiments. The University of Glasgow's Matteo Clerici, who didn't work on the project, noted to <em>The Journal</em> that the laser in the experiment costs about $2.17 billion dollars. The discoverers also plan to significantly extend the range, to the point where a 33-foot rod would have an effective coverage of 1,640 feet.</p><p>If the scientists succeed, the breakthrough could make lightning protection viable across large areas. This would be particularly useful for safeguarding rocket launchpads, where lightning strikes can <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-01-watch-spacex-launch-refurbished-dragon-capsule.html">force mission delays</a> if they're too close to the flight path. They could also be helpful for protecting airports, power plants, forests and other sprawling locations where a strike could prove catastrophic.</p>

## The tech industry still has a long way to go when it comes to accessibility

<p>As many in the accessibility community will tell you, inclusive design isn’t an endeavor that’s “one and done.” It’s a continuous, ongoing effort to ensure that as new products and services are made, people with different needs or disabilities aren’t left out. Over the last three years, Engadget has produced a report, in addition to our regular coverage, that looks back on the developments in the tech industry that impact the accessibility community, focusing on the largest companies like Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Meta. Of course, there are plenty of other big companies to consider, like Uber, Airbnb, Netflix and more. But the six we’ve selected have an outsized impact and influence on the industry..</p><p>Last year, we saw significant developments that could pave the way for more accessible designs in future, such as the opening of Microsoft’s Inclusive Tech Lab. In October, the University of Illinois (UIUC) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-microsoft-meta-google-nonprofits-speech-recognition-120021686.html">partnered with Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta and Microsoft on a Speech Accessibility Project</a> to improve voice recognition for those with atypical speech patterns that AI algorithms rarely consider. But there were also major setbacks, such as <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-layoffs-accessibility/">Elon Musk dismantling the accessibility team at Twitter</a>, amid everything else that happened in that hellhole.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>All around the industry, we saw pieces of news that showed greater interest overall in accessible products and design. <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=6deefbf2-941b-4156-9f41-a61ebb50d13d&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=LinkedIn&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2ZGVlZmJmMi05NDFiLTQxNTYtOWY0MS1hNjFlYmI1MGQxM2QiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGlua2VkaW4uY29tL3B1bHNlL2RyaXZpbmctbW9yZS1lcXVpdGFibGUtd29ya2ZvcmNlLWVuaGFuY2VkLXRvb2xzLXJlc291cmNlcy1iZXJnZXIvP3RyYWNraW5nSWQ9TTB2ZTdjV29USm1vbVF3MHIya2ozQSUzRCUzRCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMTJmNGFkNDUtMGFiZC00NzM5LWI0MjMtODRjYWQyNmEzMWI3In0&amp;signature=AQAAASFuRKDkKmELbmyAf4hShQceBss9KH9o8M5SkKV8AAVn&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fpulse%2Fdriving-more-equitable-workforce-enhanced-tools-resources-berger%2F%3FtrackingId%3DM0ve7cWoTJmomQw0r2kj3A%253D%253D">According to LinkedIn’s</a> vice president of engineering, Erran Berger, there has been a 33 percent increase in the last year in “people sharing insights, ideas and problem solving together related to accessibility”. Berger said this corresponded with a “significant uptick in the total annual number of U.S. job postings with the word ’accessibility’ in the job title.” LinkedIn data shows that these postings have “spiked 171 [percent] since September 2019.”</p><p>This increased interest permeated all of tech.

For example, it added gesture support to Echo Shows,  allowing users to dismiss timers by waving or holding up an open palm, so those who don’t want to or can’t use their voice to silence alarms can do so without touching the device. It also added support for audio streaming for hearing aids to its Fire TV platform, and <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/alexa-accessibility-features-extend-to-fire-tablets">brought the Tap To Speech (or Tap To Alexa) feature</a> from its Fire tablets to the Echo Show displays.</p><p>Amazon also teamed up with a selection of organizations to bring its products to communities that could benefit from them. It donates products like Echos, Ring home security devices and more to Home For Our Troops and the Gary Sinise Foundation, which help get these to veterans. The company also works with the National Association of the Blind in India by giving local school districts Echo devices so they can be used as teaching aids for kids with vision disabilities.</p><p>Many new Alexa features also have accessibility benefits. The <a href="https://support.ring.com/hc/en-us/articles/4616861167892">Person and Package announcements</a>, for example, let you know through the Alexa mobile app, Echo Show, Fire TV or Fire Tablet when your compatible Ring camera or video doorbell detects a… you guessed it, person or package. This way, you can choose to be alerted by visual or audio cues. On the latest Echo Dot, an onboard accelerometer allows you to tap the top of the speaker to pause and resume media playback, snooze alarms or end timers and calls. This offers those with speech impairments an alternative means of interacting with the device.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that Amazon’s remote caregiving service Alexa Together also received <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/alexa-together-is-helping-bridge-the-miles-between-families">updates</a> that allow users to add more family members to care for aging loved ones, and enabled primary caregivers to remotely set up Routines for their wards.</p><p>In October, the company released a new campaign that included videos featuring an Amazon employee and people with disabilities using accessibility features across Alexa, Fire TV and more. It also redesigned its accessibility home page to make its tools easier to discover. And, as we’ve mentioned in previous editions of this report, the company’s venture capital arm — the Alexa Fund — invests in startups, some of which work on products to improve accessibility.</p><div id="3b5d303539464b42bfe7d7ef42bb5c1e"></div><h2>Apple</h2><p>As an established leader in making accessible products, Apple continued to do well lastyear despite not doing a lot.

A slew of other small updates were also announced on GAAD, which would be too much to exhaustively detail here, but a <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MTMwZTJmMC1hMTRmLTRjNWUtYmRhYi1jZDUyYWM3ZDhlNzkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL25ld3Nyb29tLzIwMjIvMDUvYXBwbGUtcHJldmlld3MtaW5ub3ZhdGl2ZS1hY2Nlc3NpYmlsaXR5LWZlYXR1cmVzLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMTJmNGFkNDUtMGFiZC00NzM5LWI0MjMtODRjYWQyNmEzMWI3In0&amp;signature=AQAAAfKamV6z2nDRklAsD7FItzLbFpyNrpQgKnRcNMqDJPWl&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2022%2F05%2Fapple-previews-innovative-accessibility-features%2F">complete list can be found on the company’s website</a>.</p><p>On Dec. 3rd, the International Day of the Person with Disabilities, Apple released a short film that showcases its assistive features. The video was well-received and not only helped highlight the ways people with disabilities can use their i-devices to live their lives, but also introduced some lesser known features to a wider audience.</p><h2>Google</h2><p>Google is basically the internet, so its contribution to accessibility is of particular importance. Because its product portfolio is so diverse, spanning smartphones, speakers, displays, browsers, apps, email, search and more, the company’s reach is immense. That also means that Google typically has <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=0931b986-736e-47bb-80b9-5f6f8f4ef5ae&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Google&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIwOTMxYjk4Ni03MzZlLTQ3YmItODBiOS01ZjZmOGY0ZWY1YWUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS9hY2Nlc3NpYmlsaXR5LyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMTJmNGFkNDUtMGFiZC00NzM5LWI0MjMtODRjYWQyNmEzMWI3In0&amp;signature=AQAAAYTRDsSLcMuR03UiUMo4GyyODmr8HwWEBFs5_dkBbDHK&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Faccessibility%2F">a lot more updates</a> than any other name on this list. Across Android, Pixel, Chrome, Search and more, the company rolled out improvements to its screen readers, captioning and alt-text support, among others. A lot of its work in 2022 was around expanding existing features to cover more platforms and languages. For example, in December, the company <a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleIndia/status/1604741537065492480">announced its Project Relate</a> non-standard speech-recognition pilot would expand to include Hindi.</p><div id="4982af0a874045feb8fb9dad5fcba8fb"></div><p>On Global Accessibility Awareness Day in May, Google also said it was <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/braille-display-talkback/">building out-of-the-box support for braille displays into Android’s Talkback</a> screen reader, eliminating the need to install a separate app. It <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/global-accessibility-awareness-day--2022/">also announced new education-related updates</a> like support for alt-text in gmail and tweaks to the Docs experience for those using Braille readers. Chrome OS also got a little easier to use, with improved voice control and dictation, while Meet now allows users to pin multiple people on their calls, allowing those who use ASL to be able to see their sign language interpreters and other speakers at the same time. The company even looked at <a href="https://twitter.com/googlefonts/status/1544880843927089153">making fonts that were easier to read</a>.</p><p>Notably, Google also introduced Guided Frames, a tool to help blind or low vision users take selfies, when it launched the Pixel 7. Instead of being relegated to a separate day or buried in a press release, it was nice to see such a feature share the stage with other highlights during a flagship phone reveal.</p><p>Google continues to engage the disability community, and appears to be reaching out via <a href="https://twitter.com/googleaccess">its Accessibility account on Twitter</a>. As of August, it was looking to work with students with dyslexia for a research study on the Chrome browser. In December, it opened its first <a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/united-kingdom/the-accessibility-discovery-centre-is-open-for-collaboration/">Accessibility Discovery Center in the UK</a>. With this pattern of outreach and engagement, Google appears to have a meaningful approach to accessibility that adheres to the principle of “nothing about us without us.”</p><section><img alt="Three people inside the gaming section of Microsoft's new Inclusive Tech Lab.

The NDCC is intended as a jobs portal “dedicated to neurodivergent career seekers,” Microsoft said. It will feature listings by US employers looking for applicants who are neurodivergent, including those who have autism, ADHD, dyslexia, dyspraxia and Tourette Syndrome. The program will connect neurodivergent people with “companies already committed to neurodiversity hiring programs”, and companies backing the NDCC include Microsoft, Dell Technologies, Google, HP, Dell Technologies, SAP, CAI, EY and Spectrum Designs Foundation.</p><p>Speaking of careers, LinkedIn also <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=6deefbf2-941b-4156-9f41-a61ebb50d13d&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=LinkedIn&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2ZGVlZmJmMi05NDFiLTQxNTYtOWY0MS1hNjFlYmI1MGQxM2QiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGlua2VkaW4uY29tL3B1bHNlL2RyaXZpbmctbW9yZS1lcXVpdGFibGUtd29ya2ZvcmNlLWVuaGFuY2VkLXRvb2xzLXJlc291cmNlcy1iZXJnZXIvP3RyYWNraW5nSWQ9TTB2ZTdjV29USm1vbVF3MHIya2ozQSUzRCUzRCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMTJmNGFkNDUtMGFiZC00NzM5LWI0MjMtODRjYWQyNmEzMWI3In0&amp;signature=AQAAASFuRKDkKmELbmyAf4hShQceBss9KH9o8M5SkKV8AAVn&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fpulse%2Fdriving-more-equitable-workforce-enhanced-tools-resources-berger%2F%3FtrackingId%3DM0ve7cWoTJmomQw0r2kj3A%253D%253D">announced updates</a> around helping people with disabilities “voluntarily self-identify on disability and other demographic features.” For example, it added “Dyslexic Thinking” as a recognized skill that people can add to their profiles. “This example showcases that disability can also be viewed as a strength and meaningful differentiator,” Berger wrote in a blog post announcing the updates.</p><p>Microsoft also rolled out automatically generated captions for videos on LinkedIn (English, for now) and enabled alt-text for images on the platform’s ads. Last year, it also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-seeing-ai-app-scan-read-out-drug-haleon-accessibility-230047595.html">updated its Seeing AI app, </a>which lets the people who are visually impaired use their cameras to identify currency, read text and see faces. In October, in collaboration with healthcare company Haleon, Microsoft added the ability to scan the barcodes of products like Centrum, Emergen-C and Sensodyne. The app will then read out instruction, ingredients and other critical information.</p><figure><img alt="Commute traffic streams past the Meta sign outside the headquarters of Facebook parent company Meta Platforms Inc in Mountain View, California, U.S. November 9, 2022.

With the elimination of A11y, improvements to make the platform more inclusive and accessible have come to a halt, and there may be no one around to address issues that break the service for people with disabilities. The outlook for Twitter users with disabilities (and the rest of the platform) is depressingly bleak.</p>

<p>Smartphones may mean never having to ask for directions, but it can still be tricky to relay exactly where you are at any given moment to friends and family trying to find you. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/iphone/">iPhone</a> users can share their current location using Messages, Apple Maps, Google Maps and Apple’s Find My app. While Apple makes it easiest to share locations with other iPhone users, there are a number of ways to send your position to someone who uses an Android device as well. We covered four different methods in the steps below, along with a way to share from your Mac and how to stop sharing your location when you need to.</p><h2>How to share your location using Messages</h2><p>This might be the easiest method, as you’re probably already texting the person with which you want to share your location.

## The Morning After: Twitter may have deliberately cut off third-party app access

<p>Twitter appears to have deliberately <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-may-have-deliberately-cut-off-tweetbot-and-other-third-party-clients-165048001.html">cut off third-party clients</a> from accessing its API. Since Thursday evening, many of the most popular apps that scroll Twitter without going through the company’s own software, including Tweetbot and Twitterrific, haven’t worked, with no official communication from Twitter. On Sunday, a report from <em>The Information</em> featured messages from Twitter’s internal Slack channels that suggested the company is aware of the outage – and is likely the cause of it. “Third-party app suspensions are intentional,” reads one message in a channel the company’s engineers use to fix service disruptions.</p><p>In the last 24 hours, Tweetbot briefly came back online, but then fizzled out again. Does Twitter really want us to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitters-for-you-timeline-starts-rolling-out-on-desktop-web-browsers-203558483.html">reinstall its app or use it in our web browsers?</a> Will this work, or will more of us just turn off Twitter entirely?</p><p>– Mat Smith</p><p><em>The Morning After isn’t just a</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em> newsletter</em></a><em> –  it’s also a daily podcast.

Additionally, three of the S23 Ultra’s lenses (likely the primary, ultra-wide and 10x telephoto cameras) are bigger than the others.
