Would it have been worth lashing out next year\u2019s transfer budget and break wage structures for a player not guaranteed to start? Instead, the Ukrainian takes up his lengthy, lucrative new contract at Chelsea. That Gabriel Jesus\u2019s injury will keep him out longer than hoped must also have altered strategic thinking. Finding a player who can replace the Brazilian will be exacting, and while Eddie Nketiah continues to shimmer, working devilishly across the front at Tottenham, a lack of further centre-forward options points to Arsenal\u2019s primacy being a result of their having the best first XI in the Premier League rather than the deepest squad.

His memoir <em>A Childhood: The Biography of a Place </em>was first published in 1978 and is now reissued (along with <em>The Gospel Singer</em>)<em> </em>with a loving foreword by Tobias Wolff.

Bacon County, Georgia, in the 1920s and 30s is depicted as a violent, pre-modern backwater of poverty and squalor inhabited by the variably disfigured: scars, missing fingers, chewed-up ears and mangled extremities are more common than wholeness.
