<p>I've created a GitHub Action for running commands on multiple platforms. This includes platforms that GitHub Actions don't natively support. It currently supports FreeBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD. OpenBSD can run on x86-64 and ARM64, the other operating systems run on x86-64.<p>Some of the features that are supported include:<p>* Multiple operating system with one single action<p>* Multiple versions of each operating system<p>* Allows to use default shell or Bash shell<p>* Low boot overhead<p>* Fast execution<p>* Runs on both macOS and Linux runners<p>Compared to similar solutions like <a href="https://github.com/vmactions/freebsd-vm">https://github.com/vmactions/freebsd-vm</a>, the boot time is around a fifth and the full execution time for the same job is around half of freebsd-vm (last time I tried).<p>The readme contains more information about how it all works under the hood.</p>

<p>Today I'm signing out of YouTube and here's why...<p>You know how you click the X to disable Shorts and it says "Shelf will be hidden for 30 days" but then it pops up again in like a week or less?<p>Or how when you X one of those panels on some topic you have no interest in and it says "Got it, message hidden" then pops back up in a few days?<p>If YouTube is using AI then why is it so demonstrably, phenomenally bad at learning X means NO; not [Ok not today]?<p>If YT does use AI, and if it's AI is powering any other parts of Google's (Alphabet's soup) then could it explain why all Google products suck at remembering basic preferences we tell them?<p>Hey Google AI, NO means NO. Clicking X means NO. No as in forever NO, not just today or the next few days.</p>

## Ask HN: Should I quit my job?

<p>For a while now (a couple of months) I struggle with having any motivation at my programming job. I like the company's profile and have a great team, but:
- I was hired at a lower level than I interviewed for. Was going for a senior dev position, having 10 years of professional exp in the area, but apparently was hired for a mid position. I found out about this only 6 months in.
- My manager and other people in the management admitted to me I should've been hired as a senior dev. No one till now could explain to me how this happened. 
- Apparently, the company can't adjust my level, because "the processes won't allow it".
- In order to get to the level I was supposed to be hired at, I need two promotions in a row. This will mean I need 1.5-2 years with the company just to get to the senior position (!!!).
- I keep getting great reviews in the review cycles (not to brag, just to paint the full picture), but it leads to no actual actions being taken by the company: neither in terms of the levels nor in terms of the compensation. All this feels like a pat on the head.
- The title itself is meh, but it has a very tangible effect now: the company is comparing my salary to mid-level devs (usually having half of my experience) and uses this to justify no or minimal salary increases, in spite of the overachiever reviews and the inflation being at almost 20% in my country.
- All this leads to me having close to zero motivation and energy left to work here, hence me wasting time by writing this post.
- This situation left me with a bad taste in my mouth about the industry in general. I feel really disillusioned right now, even though it's not my first company. It's the first one I am so frustrated with.
- Considering the current job market, I am a bit afraid to just quit. I have enough saved up to survive quite a while without a job and have no family to support, but still, feels like a risky move.
- At the same time, I really don't have the energy to be jumping through 100 hoops in the interview process once again, at least not for the time being.
- It might be a chance to give it a shot as an indie dev, I have some ideas I wanted to try out and it's one thing I could get excited about in tech.<p>TL;DR
I am probably burned out, looking for validation from anonymous people online to make a serious life decision, what could possibly go wrong.</p>

## Ask HN: When to make the jump to freelance/consultant?

<p>I'm working full time as a data engineer/scientist but I also have one ongoing customer (a previous employer).<p>Another previous employer is launching a startup and has recently pinged me because they need to build a series of data pipelines and ML models for their product.<p>I've to talk to them about specifics but I don't see myselft having enough available time to make it work.<p>I've been thinking about starting my own data/ml services company for a while but I don't really know when to make the jump. I think (is a guess for the time being) that the income from this new job, in addition to the income of my current client, could be enough for my living expenses of this year, so I'm thinking if this is a good time to make the jump or not.<p>The problem that I see is that this new lead is from a previous partner of my current client, so both jobs are related to my previous employer, I don't have a pipeline of possible prospects for my service, so I'm not sure if I'll be able to generate a pool of prospects while doing the work for this customers.<p>My guess is that I should wait until there is a sign that I could probably get a stream of clients to keep the wheel going, and try to find the time to take this new job, maybe negotiating terms to make it possible.<p>What do you think?</p>

## Is there a license to protect my code and art from AI?

<p>I'm looking for a way to protect my GPL/MPL/other code and CC game artwork against ML that would ingest it to produce other work. The only exception is when someone uses maps to train AI-driven bots - that's fine. So, I'm looking into some standardized way to tell my work is for human use only. Ideally, also in automated way, like prefixing headers with something like /*  */.</p>

<p>It's free to play on steam, but you'll need a computer with a dedicated graphics card.<p>I just released a new version after first releasing it 18 months ago.  It's been a hard slog to scrounge time as it's not my day job but that's life.<p>There's a ton of obvious improvements in the future (weather systems, temperature, varying rainfall, ice/snow, more biomes, more plate tectonics, lava, etc) but all suggestions/feedback is welcome.</p>
