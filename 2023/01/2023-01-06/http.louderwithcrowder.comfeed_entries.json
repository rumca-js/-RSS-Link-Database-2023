Today, it's traffic in Atlanta.\n</p><p>\n\tThis completely happy and mentally stable individual took to TikTok to explain why:\n</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201c\\ud83e\\udd21\\u201d</div> \u2014 Clown World \\u2122 \\ud83e\\udd21 (@Clown World \\u2122 \\ud83e\\udd21)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ClownWorld_/status/1610843791841439744\">1672890062</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tThough this chick is insufferable to listen to, parts of what she is saying are true. Highways built in the 50s often ran through poorer neighborhoods because people with higher-value property and taxes didn't want a highway in their front yards. And poorer neighborhoods/inner cities were predominantly black.\n</p><p>\n\tBut what exactly is the purpose of being angry about it now? I think everyone's blood pressure is high enough as it is sitting in hours of traffic. Plus, racist road-building isn't required for traffic to be bad in cities. That's pretty much a given, no matter how seriously a city took the Civil Rights Movement. The #1 worst city for traffic in the U.S. is Los Angeles, which doesn't have nearly the same history regarding race as Atlanta.\n</p><p>\n\tJust for laughs, here are a few other things that have recently been labeled \"racist\" by the left:\n</p><p>\n\t1.

Will there be an Asylum test on the app? Will they have to perform a TikTok dance to prove they are true American patriots? Or perhaps pledge allegiance to Ukraine? I need answers. </p><p>Biden was also asked by a reporter about the drama over Kevin McCarthy's struggle to attain 218 votes in the Speaker's race. When asked if he was following the race, Biden struggled to come up with a simple response, until his handler-I mean, Vice President- stepped in. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cReporter: \"Are you still monitoring the Speaker's race?\"\\n\\nBiden: \"I'm following with great... uhh...

In fact, this may be the only issue where Biden has been honest with the American people. </p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!
