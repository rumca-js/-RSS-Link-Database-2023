## Show HN: List of Stripe Alternatives

<p>Seems like every time there's a negative Stripe story on here, the inevitable question, "any alternatives?" gets asked. Hell, I was tempted to ask myself. Instead, I decided to search hn.algolia.com to see for myself what others have recommended in the past.<p>Might as well share the list with y'all, make it meta.<p>--<p>2Checkout | https://www.2checkout.com<p>Adyen | https://www.adyen.com<p>Amazon Pay | https://pay.amazon.com<p>Authorize.net | https://www.authorize.net<p>Balance | https://www.getbalance.com<p>Braintree | https://www.braintreepayments.com<p>ChargeBee | https://www.chargebee.com<p>Chargify | https://www.chargify.com<p>Checkout.com | https://www.checkout.com<p>DigitalRiver | https://www.digitalriver.com<p>Dwolla | https://www.dwolla.com<p>FastSpring | https://fastspring.com<p>GoCardless | https://gocardless.com<p>MangoPay | https://www.mangopay.com<p>Mollie | https://www.mollie.com<p>Opayo (previously SagePay) | https://www.opayo.co.uk<p>Paddle | https://www.paddle.com<p>Payoneer | https://www.payoneer.com<p>PayPal | https://www.paypal.com<p>Qonto | https://qonto.com/en<p>Spreedly | https://www.spreedly.com<p>Square | https://squareup.com<p>Verifone | https://www.verifone.com/en/us<p>White | https://whitepayments.com<p>--<p>Observations from my data collection:<p>Sassy appears to have been acquired by FastSpring. Balanced Payments apparently went under but I found another payment service called "Balance" instead. Paymill is defunct but their Github org has a bunch of code. No idea what happened to Spryng Payments but Spryng still exists.<p>It's also worth mentioning that a true "Stripe alternative" simply does not exist. No one does everything they do and I'm pretty sure most services are lacking in the developer documentation department. Still, having options is always great.</p>

## Ask HN: How to restore cognition after years of trauma? I feel slow and dumb

<p>From impaired long-term and working memory, clarity of thought, mental agility, to executive function, it feels like the depression and anxiety caused by trauma have completely blunted my mind to a debilitating degree. Acquiring, integrating, and productively applying information is an enormous challenge. In meetings, I feel like a mental sloth. I've tried a variety of antidepressants, psychedelics, and supplements, to no avail. Talk therapy has done little.<p>Has anyone been able to cognitively recover?</p>

## Show HN: I spent 2 years building Tablane as a 17-year-old

<p>Hi HN community,<p>I'm Marcus, a 17-year-old Software Engineer from Germany.<p>For the past two years I've been working on Tablane [0](<a href="https://github.com/Tablane/tablane">https://github.com/Tablane/tablane</a>) a task/project management tool, with features like:<p>- Collaborative Editing (google docs)<p>- Optimistic updates with RTK Query<p>- Realtime sync with Socket.io<p>- An awesome design<p>Let me know what you think! Ask me anything!<p>How I got here:
2020: I was developing a TTT [1] (Trouble in Terrorist Town) plugin for my minecraft server, when I started to require a project management tool to keep track of the features I wanted to implement, originally I used a text file, but after some time I started using products like ClickUp and Monday.<p>But not long after I hit several paywalls for features that I wanted to use (Custom Status, Limited Number of Boards, ...)
Soon after Tablane (originally task-board) was born. I started building the website using plain HTML, then found out about React and completed Colt Steele's "Web Developer Bootcamp" [2] and "The Modern React Bootcamp" [3] and started re-writing Tablane in React, and started adding feature after feature.<p>Now I am about to finish Highschool and originally I thought about applying to college and spending another 3-5 years there, but after the positive feedback I got on a three month internship I did at ContentPepper, and seeing how my own projects developed, I decided to look for open Developer positions, to work with a team of experienced developers so I can learn even faster.<p>Links:<p>[0] <a href="https://tablane.net" rel="nofollow">https://tablane.net</a><p>[1] <a href="https://github.com/MarconLP/TTT">https://github.com/MarconLP/TTT</a><p>[2] <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-bootcamp/" rel="nofollow">https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-bootcamp/</a><p>[3] <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/" rel="nofollow">https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/</a><p>Socials:<p>Résumé/CV: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CbZi1Bm-MlDHEb4WjsFBzIBSomJa1M7T/view?usp=share_link" rel="nofollow">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CbZi1Bm-MlDHEb4WjsFBzIBSomJ...</a><p>LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcus-hof/" rel="nofollow">https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcus-hof/</a><p>Email: marcus (dot) hof (at) protonmail (dot)com<p>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/MarconLP">https://github.com/MarconLP</a><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/Marcon565" rel="nofollow">https://twitter.com/Marcon565</a></p>

## Stripe is about to refund €147k worth of payments to my all of my customers

<p>As it seemingly stands, it looks like Stripe is about to refund €147.000,00 worth of payments to my all of my customers due to 2 account closures (customers that have already received their orders).<p>I have been running 2 eCommerce stores with Stripe, where we have shipped physical products out to our customers, from a local warehouse, which have been delivered within 5-10 business days of the order being placed.<p>After about a month of running the stores, we received a notice about Stripe having to conduct a manual review on our account, and thus payouts would be frozen.<p>We submitted the requested info, for both accounts.<p>In the case of account 1 (which has approximately €101.000,00 on hold) led to an initial closure and a 120 day hold. But then later a notice about refunding all of these payments back to the customers.<p>In the case of account 2 (which has approximately €46.000,00 on hold), Stripe deemed that we’ve been performing unauthorized charges on the account, and that they will have to refund all the “affected charges”.<p>Now in the case of account 2, there are no unauthorized charges, all customers have received their products and we have tracking numbers to prove this.<p>In the case of account 1, we requested a further review and got the reply that our money would be held for 120 days, and that “the affected card payments in 5 business days from the account closing day,” with a link referring to all the charges in our dashboard.<p>Obviously we also have tracking numbers to prove that literally every succeeded payment from account 1 have received their products, and we have submitted this to Stripe as well.<p>The reason for closure of both accounts is that our business is “high risk”. I’m not sure what this really means in our case, as we just sell consumer electronics in the $100-200 price range from a local warehouse (no dropshipping or anything like that).<p>Effectively what I can take away from this, is that Stripe is about to refund all the payments from my customers which evens out approximately €147.000,00.<p>When calculated in that stock has already been paid for and sent out, this translates to about a total net loss in the range of €250.000,00 for our business.<p>I’m not sure if this is a result of Stripe’s automated fraud protection systems, or if an actual human has decided that it’s adequate to try and refund €147.000,00. Worth of customer payments that have already received their order.<p>Regardless, I can understand an X day hold of the money, although it is annoying, but as far as I can tell, it most likely is not legal for Stripe to actually just refund customers who have already received their orders?
If the payments do end up being refunded, we will of course be taking legal action and contacting media outlets in efforts bring this story to the public eye, and to hold Stripe accountable for this.<p>Has anybody had a similar experience where they lost over 6 figures worth of payments, basically for no good reason?</p>

## Ask HN: What's on your home server?

<p>It's been years (over a decade?) since I've had a server at home but I'm setting one up for media and I got to thinking: what else should I do with this box? So I was wondering what cool/nerdy/weird stuff you all are using home servers for. DNS and file sharing seem like obvious applications I could set up. I already run email and web on a VPS so that's taken care of. What are you doing with your home server?</p>
