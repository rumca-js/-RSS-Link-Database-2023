Just off to the left, through a door you had to open by combining an antique bust, some costume makeup and a bucket of drool to form a key which\u2026 well, you get the joke.</p><p>Children of Silentown does carry some classic point-and-click DNA, most evident in the way Lucy interacts with her lugubrious surroundings. Just as the Lucasarts classics of yore used to task you with increasingly absurd and convoluted item combinations in their puzzles, developer Elf Game Works stamps its own take on the trope, allowing for all manner of unexpected and inevitably, creepy conclusions.</p><p>But rather than mimic the past like Thimbleweed Park (which did so to great effect, mind you), Children of Silentown finds its own ground in a dark, gloomy, and oddly cute world. It\u2019s like a Tim Burton fever dream, expressed in Chibi.</p><p>Protagonist Lucy has a mystery to solve in the village of Silentown, which isn\u2019t without its sinister elements. Like the fact that people go missing from it with alarming regularity, for example. But despite a populous of ghostly eyed, ever-diminishing, mournful-looking denizens, the real danger lies outside the village, in the forest. Seriously. Do not go into the forest. Stop even thinking about the forest.</p>\n<figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\"><div class=\"image-full-width-wrapper\"><div class=\"image-widthsetter\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top: 56.25%;\"><img align=\"middle\" alt=\"Children of Silentown\" class=\"\" height=\"1080\" id=\"NM5w8jdT4U6QystoWzHhx4\" name=\"1.png\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NM5w8jdT4U6QystoWzHhx4.png\" width=\"1920\" /></p></div></div><figcaption class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\">(Image credit: Daedalic)</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>While it\u2019s not explicitly a horror title\u2014no jump scares here, YouTubers circa 2012, move along - the dark atmosphere pervades every corner of Lucy\u2019s adventure. Including and not limited to a mischievous cat who teases and torments Lucy at every opportunity, and\u2014wait, you\u2019re thinking about the forest again, aren\u2019t you? Seriously, we told you: don\u2019t.\u00a0</p><p>Music\u2019s a big player here. Not only is it working hard to set the game\u2019s Burton-esque atmosphere, it also doubles up as a mechanic. As you learn to sing with Lucy, you learn to wield music as another tool to call upon in times of trouble.\u00a0</p><p>Children of Silentown is available now on Steam\u2014this is a full release too, not an Early Access version. Sample Lucy\u2019s investigation into the missing persons cases of Silentown, what lies beyond it in the woodland, and why she finds it so hard to get a good night\u2019s rest without disturbing dreams. Given her location, we think we\u2019d probably struggle too.
