Instead, the presentation was dominated by partners who spoke about what they\u2019re doing with AMD technology. That allowed AMD to step out from under Intel\u2019s shadow as one of the major companies enabling its partners to define the future.\u00a0</p><p>AMD, of course, highlighted its technology and aggressively pointed out how it\u2019s outperforming rivals. But this time, it had full back-up from partners on stage who could validate the results. What was also fascinating was that each partner seemed to know AMD CEO Lisa Su and obviously liked her. This is important in a partnership and showcases AMD\u2019s unique advantage in the x86 space. (One interesting comment in passing: Teslas plan to feature AMD for in-car gaming in the future. One undercurrent from the show was that almost every car maker showcased some kind of gaming partnership, suggesting that once cars drive themselves, we\u2019ll all become gamers.)</p><p class=\"jumpTag\"><a href=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/3684754/microsoft-teases-windows-12-at-ces-2023.html#jump\">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.computerworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.computerworld.com/article/3684751/microsoft-s-bid-for-activision-blizzard-faces-new-regulatory-delays-in-uk.html#tk.rss_all", "title": "Microsoft\u2019s bid for Activision-Blizzard faces new regulatory delays in UK", "date_published": "2023-01-06 16:12:00+00:00", "description": "<article>\n\t<section class=\"page\">\n<p>Microsoft\u2019s proposed\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/3647294/microsoft-to-buy-video-game-maker-activision-blizzard-for-687b.html\">$68.7 billion purchase</a>\u00a0of game studio Activision Blizzard is facing closer scrutiny from regulators: A month after a US regulator asked a court to halt the deal, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), the UK regulatory body that investigates potential anti-competitive behavior, has extended the timetable for its\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/3666829/uk-competition-and-markets-authority-ramps-up-big-tech-antitrust-investigations.html\">ongoing investigation</a>.</p><p>The UK regulator was due to publish its findings from the phase two investigation on March 1, 2023, however, in a <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/63b55087d3bf7f291f280c2f/MS_Activision_-_Notice_of_extension_Jan_2023.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">statement released on January 5</a>, the CMA said this deadline had been pushed back until April 26, 2023.
