<p></p><p>Marcus Rashford will surely make all player of the year shortlists if he continues to put in performances like this. The No 10 was the creative force behind Antony’s opener and Conor Coady’s own goal before scoring an added-time penalty that came after Alejandro Garnacho was yanked down and which ensured Manchester United are into the next round of the FA Cup.</p><p>Erik ten Hag, though, may curse how reckless his side were when exerting control was the smart move. They dominated but failed to stiff-arm Everton, ceding the ball countless times and allowing them to make this tie a contest.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/06/manchester-united-everton-fa-cup-third-round-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## Kimbra on the ups and downs of fame: ‘Always having to look like a pop star is exhausting’

<p>At just 21, the New Zealand musician became famous for her part in smash-hit song Somebody That I Used to Know. So what happened after?</p><p>Lately, Kimbra has been thinking about her anxiety. It’s something she’s long struggled with but has begun to take more seriously as an adult. “I have a really challenging career, so sometimes I [feel like], why me? Then I’m like, well, it makes sense,” she says, her native Kiwi accent dulled by years of living in the US. “Any young woman who was thrown into the spotlight young, who has to think every day about how they appear, to be scrutinised, and has a lot of people putting money into their career – obviously, I’m going to be susceptible to anxiety.”</p><p>Kimbra Lee Johnson, who you probably know mononymously, has been in the public eye for most of her life. She began performing and making music at 11 (see the <a href="https://www.nzonscreen.com/title/what-now-kimbra-excerpt-2001/comments">adorable clip</a> of her declaring “one day, I’d love to be a pop star” on a New Zealand children’s show). At 17, she signed a management deal with financing, part of a long game plan to get her ready to launch as an artist, “which is a huge privilege but fucking pressure as well”. By the time she was 21, she had achieved the sort of success most musicians can only dream of when she appeared on the 2011 Gotye hit Somebody That I Used to Know, which topped the charts in 23 countries, was awarded two Grammys and now ranks among the bestselling digital singles of all time. Her debut album, released soon after, went platinum in Australia and New Zealand and proved her flair for creating interesting, left-of-centre pop songs that are more Björk than Britney Spears.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/07/kimbra-on-the-ups-and-downs-of-fame-always-having-to-look-like-a-pop-star-is-exhausting">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Bill passed by Giorgia Meloni’s rightwing coalition means event organisers can have their phones tapped and face six years in jail</p><p>Until last week, Santano Viperillo was just a music producer and promoter living in Naples. But on 30 December, everything changed and he became a potential criminal thanks to a new government crackdown on illegal raves. If Viperillo (who goes by a pseudonym) continues to organise the parties he has been running since the 90s, initially as part of the famed 1990s Neapolitan rave crew <a href="http://www.unitedtribes.it/">United Tribes</a>, he could face up to six years in prison.</p><p>The so-called <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/02/freedom-killing-monster-italian-leader-giorgia-meloni-criticised-rave-laws">“decreto anti-rave”</a> was the first bill proposed by Giorgia Meloni’s rightwing coalition when the prime minister took office in October. Now officially approved by parliament, it makes organising raves a specific crime punishable with three to six years of jail time, fines of up to €10,000 (£8,900) and the confiscation of equipment. The new statute also allows the surveillance of groups who are suspected of holding these unauthorised events, <a href="https://ilmanifesto.it/carcere-e-intercettazioni-la-stretta-sui-rave-arriva-per-decreto">including tapping their phones</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/06/italian-ravers-new-laws-meloni">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The farcical scenes among US Republicans have echoes in our Tory party. Both promise disruption, then deliver exactly that</p><p>The US right has this week been staging a clown show that has had liberals in that country and beyond pulling up a chair and breaking out the popcorn. There has been a karmic pleasure in watching the Republicans who won control of the House of Representatives struggle to complete the most basic piece of business – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/audio/2023/jan/06/kevin-mccarthy-faces-mutiny-over-speakership-politics-weekly-america-podcast">the election of a speaker</a> – but it’s also been instructive, and not only to Americans. For it has confirmed the dirty little secret of that strain of rightwing populist politics that revels in what it calls disruption: it always ends in bitter factional fighting, chaos and paralysis. We in Britain should know, because Brexit has gone the exact same way.</p><p>Start with the karma that saw House Republicans gather two years to the day since they sought to prevent the peaceful transfer of power from one party to another: often overlooked in the anniversary recollections of 6 January 2021 is that, mere hours after rioters had stormed the US Capitol, a majority of Republican House members <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/07/us/elections/electoral-college-biden-objectors.html">voted</a> to do precisely as the rioters had demanded and overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.

<p>The extreme Republicans blocking Kevin McCarthy are refusing to accept a loss – the core of the Trumpist playbook</p><p>Autocrats around the world, after a pretty bad 2022, must be delighted: just in time for the second anniversary of the Capitol insurrection, the US is providing a spectacle of democratic dysfunction for stunned global audiences to behold. But the Republican faction holding the country hostage – the farthest right inside what de facto has become <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/21449634/republicans-supreme-court-gop-trump-authoritarian">a far-right party</a> – wants to convince us that this is simply what democracy looks like – messy and frustrating, but all happening for the sake of a better result in the end. The Groundhog Day-style procedures are dignified as – in the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/byron-donalds-defends-voting-against-mccarthy-speaker-want-resolution">words</a> of failed speaker of the House candidate Byron Donalds – a “deliberative, open process” necessary for the “constitutional republic that is America”.</p><p>The fact is that the Republicans blocking Kevin McCarthy’s bid for speaker are not crazy when they suggest that good-faith debate <em>within</em> the same political party can be beneficial for a democratic polity. Except that their political performance art is really about a refusal to accept a loss – the very core of the Trumpist playbook. This is not what democracy looks like; this is what acting out a belief in minority rule looks like.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/06/house-speaker-debacle-republicans-maga-revolution">Continue reading...</a>

It is impossible to understand how it went from a pastime for the propertied few to a mass civic endeavour without the Chartists, a movement built on the foundations of working-class organisation.</p><p>In the many decades since, the workers’ movement has remained at the forefront of this fight. If democracy is to mean anything substantial, it can’t just be the preserve of Westminster or local government. It must be present in our daily lives – most of which are spent in the workplace. Beyond fighting for better wages and conditions, this is the role of trade unions: they are our democratic representation at work.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/06/rishi-sunak-anti-strike-legislation-britain-economy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Book of Desire by Meena Kandasamy; The Translations of Seamus Heaney; Mother of Flip-Flops by Mukahang Limbu; White/Other by Fran Lock; and Arctic Elegies by Peter Davidson</p><p><strong>The Book of Desire</strong> <strong>by</strong> <strong>Meena Kandasamy (<a href="https://www.guardianbookshop.com/the-book-of-desire-9781913111366?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article">Galley Beggar, £14.99</a>)</strong><strong><br /></strong>A translation of the third part of the Tirukkural, one of the earliest works of Tamil poetry. As Kandasamy explains, Tamil poetry has long been sidelined within Indian culture, with the explicit content of The Book of Desire attracting much moralising censorship down the centuries. The text bristles with electrifying encounters, dramas of social shame and separation, and solitary longing (“I swim the rough seas / of sexual desire, I see / no shore – in the dead / of night, I am alone”). The poem’s treatment of caste in a Brahmin world (“all lives are equal by birth”) is also bold. Kandasamy’s pellucid translation is a radically decolonising and feminist gesture, and an important moment for Tamil poetry in English.</p><p><br /><strong>The Translations of Seamus Heaney by Seamus Heaney (<a href="https://www.guardianbookshop.com/the-translations-of-seamus-heaney-9780571342525?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article">Faber, £25</a>)</strong><br />As a translator, Heaney was a benignly conscientious custodian of tradition; where Ezra Pound had wild adventure, Heaney has measure and caution. The versions of Beowulf and Virgil collected here are sturdy acts of repossession, sure to keep their place for many years to come, while his co-translations with Stanisław Barańczak of Jan Kochanowski’s Laments are exquisite and heart-rending. His commitment to verse drama, in his versions of Sophocles (The Cure at Troy and The Burial at Thebes), was no less admirable. While his contemporary Derek Mahon will always have the edge for sparkle and bravura as a translator, this volume is handsome testimony to Heaney’s lifelong service to a noble art.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/06/the-best-recent-poetry-review-roundup">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Perhaps Potter can hack it with a superclub, perhaps he can’t, but these would be difficult times at Stamford Bridge for any manager</p><p>The problem for any coach when they step up to a big club is that, until they have been successful at that level, the suspicion will always linger that they cannot be successful at that level. It’s one of the difficulties of the modern game: managing an elite club, with the huge budgets, the vast expectations, the array of egos needing constant maintenance (which these days seems to apply to fans as much as players), is a very different job to managing on a shoestring down the leagues.</p><p>As one Premier League director once put it to me, saying his club should have immediately replaced the manager who had just led them to promotion, you don’t put the bloke who runs the corner shop in charge of a multinational. Which is true, even if the thought that football is somehow too loyal takes some getting used to – a function, as much as anything else, of the financial stratification that exists within the game. Corner shops don’t become multinationals overnight; there is no retail outlet equivalent of winning the playoffs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/06/graham-potter-chelsea-aspiring-coaches">Continue reading...</a>

But how much of it is actually useful? <strong>Plus: how to have a baby on a budget</strong></p><p>Most nights, around 3am, first-time mum Courtney Sanders is on her phone in the dark as she tries to rock her baby to sleep. Her three-month-old son is struggling with colic-like symptoms and the more Sanders searches for how to help, the more products are suggested to her. “My Facebook is currently full of ads for bedside cribs that come with an incline to help reduce colic – but I already have one of those and it doesn’t do anything.”</p><p>She’s tried different feeding bottles, teats and milk formulas. The last thing she bought was a Windi. “It’s a tube you put into the baby’s bottom to help them pass wind,” she says. It didn’t work. Right now, she’s searching for a new baby monitor, as the one she bought is too complicated to use. Tomorrow she’s expecting a delivery of Munchy Mitts – a babygrow with silicone mitts for teething babies to chew on.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/06/the-parent-trap-is-expensive-baby-tech-making-us-paranoid">Continue reading...</a>

I remember at an early press conference he was asked how his English was progressing, to which he responded “It’s getting better, but when I talk to Dennis (Wise) I understand nothing”.<br />Legend.

<p>Today’s tittle-tattle is unseasonably warm</p><p>It’s bad news for <strong>Manchester United</strong> fans who enjoy interminable transfer sagas. According to Joan Laporta, the Barcelona president, <strong>Frenkie de Jong</strong> is “not for sale”. Thankfully, United are linked with countless other players so, for the moment at least, the Barça midfielder can take a back seat. Taking his place riding up front in United’s careening transfer go-kart: <strong>Randal Kolo Muani</strong>, with <strong>Mohammed Kudus</strong> perched precariously above the cup holders and <strong>Axel Disasi</strong> clinging on to the headrest.</p><p>Having impressed at Eintracht Frankfurt so far this season, Kolo Muani could be an interesting solution to United’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/30/manchester-united-and-ten-hag-must-be-creative-to-sign-striker-in-january">striker problem</a>. That said, Frankfurt apparently value him at anything up to €100m (£88.5m) and wouldn’t want to let him go in January which, given United’s pressing need for a forward, could be a stumbling block. As long as Frankfurt qualify for Europe, the France international could even stay beyond the summer. Oh, and he’s also a target for <strong>Bayern Munich</strong>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/06/football-transfer-rumours-manchester-united-in-for-kolo-muani">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From the Netflix Addams Family spin-off to countless new novels and wellness books, witches are having a cultural moment. Why now, and what does that say about our modern age?</p><p>From a feminist retelling of Pride and Prejudice, featuring Lydia Bennet as a witch, to a history of landmark trials and a host of magical wellness titles, 2023 is the year in which witch books will truly cast their spell. No longer a niche market, the titles coming out range from historical fiction to fantasy to self-help. Witches have permeated every corner of the publishing world, as well as our TV screens, with the Netflix Addams Family spin-off hit <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/19/wednesday-netflix-have-absolutely-smashed-this-fantastic-addams-family-revamp">Wednesday</a>, and a TV adaptation of Anne Rice’s Lives of the Mayfair Witches trilogy on the way.</p><p>So why the fascination now? Witch-hunts raged across Europe and colonial America for more than 400 years, from the 14th to the 18th century, killing thousands, mostly women. Yet while witches have inspired books, films and works of art over the centuries, the literary outpouring has increased noticeably in recent years.

<p>When I came across the box of papers, I was shocked by the extent of Dad’s lies</p><p>After my dad, Peter, died in 2011, I found a box of papers and a photo album under his bed. That’s how I discovered he had a secret wife named Irene, and that he was 10 years older than he had said he was. Even his birthday was different. I found photos of his family and discovered he had 12 siblings he’d never told me about.</p><p>Dad was a first-generation immigrant from Ghana. He went to Harlech College in Wales, on a scholarship in the 1960s and later worked at the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE). He met my mum, Su, who is white British, in 1987 at a work conference. We lived together in Wolverhampton in the 90s.

In her mirage-like lyrics and mix of gently warped folk and nomadic jazz, you can stumble on moments of sharp recognition. A former art student, Plain is a longtime member of Kate Stables’ luminous folk band This Is the Kit and a fixture of the Cleaner Records collective, which she founded with fellow folk artist Rachael Dadd. All the while, she has nurtured her own ambitions. Prize, her fifth record, is a document of her evolution over the past 15 years, and, with its sprawling supporting cast, a tribute to the collective spirit that has defined her career.</p><p>Plain’s lyrics are simple, but their meaning remains just beyond a listener’s grasp – as if she is trying to articulate the depth of a dream. On Prove Your Good, subtle word shifts tempt a thousand meanings: “Prove you did, prove you do / Proving it to who?” Her thicket of riddles would almost be frustrating were it not for the clarity brought by her vibrant music, aided by her many collaborators, such as Stables, jazz musician Alabaster DePlume, and harpist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2013/mar/28/serafina-steer-disco-compliation">Serafina Steer</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/06/rozi-plain-prize-review-memphis-industries-folk">Continue reading...</a>

## Starmer may lack Blair’s charisma, but he may well change Britain more than New Labour ever did | Andy Beckett

<p>Without the optimism that carried Labour to power in the mid-90s, the party now has no choice but to go big on reform</p><p>Britain seems in a strange mood as 2023 blearily begins. One of the worst periods of peacetime crisis in our modern history grinds on. Frighteningly, it is spreading into more and more areas of life that we’re used to thinking the state and business have largely under control. One of the world’s richest countries, even after the economic calamities of Tory rule, has in many ways become dysfunctional.</p><p>Yet the response from voters seems complex and relatively muted. There is fear – please don’t let me <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/05/hospitals-in-england-discharging-patients-into-care-hotels">need a hospital</a> – and frustration at how the stoppages and shortages are dragging on. There is disbelief at the country’s accelerating deterioration; but also fatalism, a feeling that Britain was due a fall after years of cost-cutting, complacency and overindulgence. There is exhaustion at the sheer length of the disruption; and scepticism about the ability of any politician to end it. But there is less overt anger than might reasonably be expected. Unlike the early 1980s, or the early 2010s – like now, both times when Tory policies were doing immense social damage – Britain is not rioting. At least, not yet.</p><p>Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/06/keir-starmer-tony-blair-reform-new-labour-90s">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ukraine rejects Russia’s proposed ceasefire; Germany sending additional Patriot air defence battery to Ukraine</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia+ukraine">See all our Russia-Ukraine war coverage</a></li></ul><p><strong>The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has rejected out of hand a Russian order for a truce over Orthodox Christmas,</strong> saying it was a trick to halt the progress of Ukraine’s forces in the eastern Donbas region and bring in more of their own. Speaking pointedly in Russian and addressing both the Kremlin and Russians as a whole on Thursday, Zelenskiy said Moscow had repeatedly ignored Kyiv’s own peace plan.</p><p><strong>The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, instructed his defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, to introduce a 36-hour ceasefire along the entire line of contact in Ukraine </strong>from noon on Friday to midnight on 7 January, the Kremlin said. Russian troops must hold fire for 36 hours in order to allow people “in the areas of hostilities” to mark Orthodox Christmas, Putin said.</p><p><strong>The war would end, Zelenskiy said, when Russian troops left Ukraine or were thrown out. </strong>“They now want to use Christmas as a cover, albeit briefly, to stop the advances of our boys in Donbas and bring equipment, ammunitions and mobilised troops closer to our positions,” the Ukrainian leader said in his nightly video address. “What will that give them? Only yet another increase in their total losses.” He said the war “will end either when your soldiers leave or we throw them out”.</p><p><strong>The US state department expressed skepticism over Putin’s announced ceasefire</strong>, describing it as “cynical” given Moscow’s New Year’s Day attack on Ukraine and saying the US had “little faith” in the announcement’s intentions.</p><p><strong>Putin’s announcement came hours after the head of the Russian Orthodox church, Patriarch Kirill, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jan/05/russia-ukraine-war-live-no-rational-reason-west-hasnt-sent-tanks-says-zelenskiy-as-allies-offer-armoured-vehicles-instead?page=with:block-63b69dcb8f084f5e7540c212#block-63b69dcb8f084f5e7540c212">called for a ceasefire</a></strong> and a Christmas truce in Ukraine<strong>. </strong>In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jan/05/russia-ukraine-war-live-no-rational-reason-west-hasnt-sent-tanks-says-zelenskiy-as-allies-offer-armoured-vehicles-instead?page=with:block-63b69dcb8f084f5e7540c212#block-63b69dcb8f084f5e7540c212">a statement</a>, Kirill said he appealed to “all parties involved in the internecine conflict” for the ceasefire, so that “Orthodox people can attend services on Christmas Eve and the day of the Nativity of Christ”.</p><p><strong>Germany will join the US in supplying an additional Patriot air defence battery to Ukraine, </strong>the White House has announced, after the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and the US president, Joe Biden, spoke by phone. The two leaders “expressed their common determination to continue to provide the necessary financial, humanitarian, military and diplomatic support to Ukraine for as long as needed”, the White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/01/05/joint-press-statement-following-a-call-between-the-president-joe-biden-and-the-chancellor-of-the-federal-republic-of-germany-olaf-scholz/">said in a statement.</a></p><p><strong>The US believes that Vladimir Putin’s ally Yevgeny Prigozhin is interested in taking control of salt and gypsum from mines near the Ukrainian-held city of Bakhmut,</strong> a White House official said on Thursday. There were indications that monetary motives were driving Russia’s and Prigozhin’s “obsession” with Bakhmut, the official added. Prigozhin is the owner of private Russian military company Wagner Group.</p><p><strong>Germany’s economy minister, Robert Habeck, said Germany providing weapons to Ukraine</strong> <strong>was a “good decision”</strong> during a Thursday briefing.

<p>Another Manchester City and Chelsea clash, plus Wrexham, Chesterfield and Boreham Wood flying non-league flag</p><p>When Manchester City and Chelsea met in the FA Cup in 2016, a raft of injuries, a packed schedule and the need to prioritise a looming Champions League match and the League Cup final compelled Manuel Pellegrini to field five teenagers for full City debuts at Stamford Bridge. To nobody’s surprise, his callow side was walloped by their far more experienced hosts and Pellegrini went on to be replaced by one of the few Premier League or Championship managers who treat the world’s oldest cup competition with the utmost respect and seriousness. “It was honestly one of the proudest moments of my life,” said Guardiola of City’s emphatic 2019 Cup final win, although his team are likely to face far less feeble opposition when they welcome Chelsea. While neither Guardiola nor Graham Potter is likely to field full-strength sides, both have more than enough quality players in reserve to ensure a full-blooded contest. City’s astonishing strength in squad depth could prove crucial. <strong>Barry Glendenning</strong></p><p><em>Manchester City v Chelsea, Sunday 4.30pm (all times GMT)</em></p><p><em>Coventry v Wrexham, Saturday 5.30pm</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/06/fa-cup-third-round-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend">Continue reading...</a>
