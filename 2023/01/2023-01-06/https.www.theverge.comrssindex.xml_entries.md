  <p id="FXcxlA">Microsoft has been going out of its way to encourage regulators to approve its proposed $68.7 billion deal for Activision Blizzard, and in its latest move, the company is running an ad in <em>The Washington Post</em> spelling out the tech giant’s acceptance of unions. The ad is co-signed by the Communications Workers of America (CWA), which represents workers in industries like communications and media.</p>
<p id="2Tnaod">“As we enter a new year, we remain committed to creating the best workplaces we can for people who make a living in the tech sector,” the beginning of the ad reads. “When both labor and management bring their voices to the bargaining table, employees, shareholders and customers alike benefit.”</p>

<p id="iKeuif">According to court documents, Castro began editing Zulily’s software code for checkout payments in February 2022, which allowed him to steal around $260,000 in electrical payments by diverting shipping fees from Zulily customer purchases to a Stripe account that he controlled, in some cases double-charging customers for shipping. </p>

If you have a notebook or Post-its on your desk where you like to write notes but also sometimes like to navigate your laptop’s screen with a stylus, you now only need one pen to do both. You could also try sketching out a picture, chart, or graph on paper before diving into doing so on a computer without putting down your writing utensil. You could take physical notes on a text that you’re reading on your computer, then also reach up and...</p>

  <p id="BHhC6o">CES will continue through the weekend, but <em>The Verge</em> has already seen a whole lot of what the show has to offer. This week on <em>The Vergecast</em>, myself, our editor-in-chief, Nilay Patel, and our senior news editor, Richard Lawler, get together and talk about some of the weirdest stuff we’ve seen, the most absurd concepts, and all the genuinely cool tech coming out of the show.</p>
<div id="hhyOHr"></div>
<p id="i2p2Xh">We start the show talking about some of the goofiest car concepts we saw, including the Sony and Honda collaboration dubbed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/4/23539863/sony-honda-electric-vehicle-afeela-ces-reveal-photos">Afeela</a> and BMW’s new concept that has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/5/23540358/bmw-color-changing-car-concept-e-ink-i-vision-dee-ces">color-changing panels</a> (courtesy of E Ink) and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/4/23538742/bmw-i-vision-dee-concept-ces-av-ar-voice-assistant-e-ink">a digital assistant</a>. </p>

## Here’s why Samsung and Dell’s new monitors are so exciting for Mac users

  <p id="fgS20s">A weird thing has happened at CES this year: display manufacturers not named Apple have announced true 5K and 6K monitors designed for creative work and productivity. These new monitors, which will appeal to Mac users for reasons other than “it’s white and doesn’t have RGB lights,” are providing some actual competition to Apple’s Studio Display and even an alternative to the staggeringly expensive pro-level Pro Display XDR.</p>
<p id="QYtJRz">It’s hard to overstate how rare this actually is. Though there have been many monitors marketed toward MacBook owners over the years, with features such as USB-C connectivity, high-wattage charging, and nicer than average designs, they’ve typically all had traditional 4K panels and sub-par pixel densities, as opposed...</p>

## Ring’s Always Home Cam won’t be flying in your home until at least 2024, if then

But it was flying in an empty room behind a glass door and disappearing into a side room between flights, so we never saw it take off or land.

## The Peugeot Inception concept is an EV knife aimed straight at the future

  <p id="ZdW3Nh">French automaker Peugeot revealed its Inception concept, a deadly looking electric car that’s all sharp angles and brutalist designs. The concept, which was <a href="https://www.media.stellantis.com/em-en/peugeot/press/peugeot-inception-concept-peugeot-opens-a-new-chapter-and-presents-its-vision-of-the-future-of-the-automobile">announced at CES</a> this week, will inspire a lineup of future EVs that will start making their way to customers in 2025. </p>
<p id="bvlELM">Stellantis, which owns Peugeot, had a heavy docket at this year’s CES, including a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/4/23537184/chrysler-cockpit-synthesis-ces-infotainment-stla">Chrysler cockpit</a> concept and a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/5/23540709/ram-1500-revolution-concept-ev-truck-ces-photos-specs">battery-electric Ram 1500 truck</a> that borrows a lot from the world of muscle cars. But the Peugeot Inception was arguably the most CES-y of all the announcements, with its rectangular steering wheel, hyper-minimal dashboard, and color-shifting interior. There’s even a device inside the car called “the Halo Cluster” with a 360-degree screen, for some...</p>

  <p id="orwg6R">It’s almost time for Games Done Quick’s first speedrunning extravaganza of the year. The 2023 edition of Awesome Games Done Quick (AGDQ) kicks off on Sunday, and this year’s event looks to once again feature a week-long feast of incredible gaming feats.</p>
<p id="6ADEya">The first game on tap is an any-percent run of <em>Splatoon 3</em>, meaning the runner can use any means necessary to beat the game, and<em> </em>I can’t wait to see how an expert inks their way to the ending in just over an hour. That’s followed by a 29-minute run of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, which will almost certainly feature a lot of ridiculous physics stunts; you can get a preview of what’s in store by watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9K3HwQWHaEs">this recent video from the AGDQ runner</a>.</p>

  <p id="HWviHa">I will admit that I was skeptical when I first saw pictures of Lenovo’s new dual-screen Yoga Book 9i. I’ve <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23329564/asus-zenbook-17-fold-oled-review-price-screen-specs-foldable">tried foldables</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23063863/asus-zenbook-pro-duo-14-review-screenpad-plus-dual-screen-laptop-specs-features-price">and dual-screens</a> aplenty, and while many are usable, many also have serious limitations. But this is the first dual-screen laptop I’ve ever tried that I could see myself actually buying. And that’s because Lenovo has clearly done the software engineering necessary to make sure it can address many of the somewhat... obvious concerns that shoppers might have with such a device.</p>

  <p id="uv9chG">Tesla has re-introduced a round steering wheel option for its Model S and Model X vehicles, following two years of criticism regarding the practicality and safety of the racing-style yoke steering. As noted by <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/01/05/tesla-offers-round-steering-wheel-model-s-x/"><em>Electrek</em></a>, the Tesla online configurator for the Model S/X <a href="https://www.tesla.com/models/design#overview">was updated</a> on Thursday, adding the option for a round steering wheel alongside the existing yoke. Selecting the rounded wheel option doesn’t impact the price or the estimated delivery timeline. Other Tesla models such as the Model 3 and Model Y are already available with a round steering wheel.</p>
