As Kandasamy explains, Tamil poetry has long been sidelined within Indian culture, with the explicit content of The Book of Desire attracting much moralising censorship down the centuries. The text bristles with electrifying encounters, dramas of social shame and separation, and solitary longing (\u201cI swim the rough seas / of sexual desire, I see / no shore \u2013 in the dead / of night, I am alone\u201d). The poem\u2019s treatment of caste in a Brahmin world (\u201call lives are equal by birth\u201d) is also bold.

His commitment to verse drama, in his versions of Sophocles (The Cure at Troy and The Burial at Thebes), was no less admirable.

To nobody\u2019s surprise, his callow side was walloped by their far more experienced hosts and Pellegrini went on to be replaced by one of the few Premier League or Championship managers who treat the world\u2019s oldest cup competition with the utmost respect and seriousness. \u201cIt was honestly one of the proudest moments of my life,\u201d said Guardiola of City\u2019s emphatic 2019 Cup final win, although his team are likely to face far less feeble opposition when they welcome Chelsea. While neither Guardiola nor Graham Potter is likely to field full-strength sides, both have more than enough quality players in reserve to ensure a full-blooded contest.
