<p>Windows 11 is a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/539183/windows-11-review-an-unnecessary-replacement-for-windows-10.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">contentious piece of software</a>. While some appreciate the new aesthetic Microsoft is going for, there&rsquo;s no denying that Windows 10 remains wildly popular and more than functional for the foreseeable future. But there is, technically, an advantage in the newer software, especially if you happen to be running a high-end Intel-powered machine. Is it enough to make a difference? Gordon and Adam investigate on the PCWorld YouTube channel. </p>



<p>Gordon used the latest Intel Core i9 processor with some of the most powerful parts around to run a series of tests on the latest builds of both Windows 10 and Windows 11. Swapping out the boot drives, themselves identical hardware, is the only difference in the series of tests. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>Testing included Cinebench, Handbrake, PugetBench Adobe Premiere, Photoshop, and Lightroom, UL Procyon Creative Suite and Office 365, Crossmark Enterprise, GeekBench, Chrome 107 in a variety of testing environments, and Nero Score. For gaming they tried a variety of our usual benchmarks. </p>



<p>So, is it worth it to upgrade? To spoil a 20-minute video, the answer is a big ol&rsquo; no. In almost all of the tests the results were so close that they were within a benchmarking margin of error, meaning essentially identical performance. In the few that were different, Windows 11 might get a 3 to 4 percent advantage&hellip;and in a few Windows 10 did instead. If performance is what concerns you, there&rsquo;s basically no reason to upgrade from Windows 10, even on the most powerful hardware. </p>



<p>Even when Gordon tried stacking programs and benchmarks and turning the iGPU on and off, the results were more or less the same. Aside from a few tests in Chrome and Photoshop, it was essentially a draw&hellip;with Windows 11 and 10 trading slight advantages.

## The long-promised PCIe 5.0 SSD revolution failed to arrive at CES 2023

<p>Compatible CPUs and motherboards have existed since 2021. Multiple vendors announced their first takes last summer. AMD even said during its Ryzen 7000 processor launch to expect models in November 2022. But blistering fast, face-melting PCIe 5 SSDs have yet to actually materialize.</p>



<p>This point was driven home at CES 2023, where much of the big PC news has remained focused on chip launches and laptops. If you were looking forward to a big display of different PCIe 5 SSDs, your hopes have been disappointed. Vendors with previous announcements have largely stayed silent.</p>



<p>But glittering city lights may finally be in sight at the end of this long, winding road. CES 2023 has at least yielded hints that concrete launches are around the bend. At MSI&rsquo;s booth, two PCIe 5 SSDs are on display (which you can see for yourself in <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.tomshardware.com/news/msi-pcie-5-ssd-spatium-m570-pro&amp;xcust=2-1-1447979-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Tom&rsquo;s Hardware&rsquo;s report</a>)&mdash;and have an estimated launch date of Q2. The MSI Spatium 570 will hit 10GB/s read and write speeds, while the Spatium 570 Pro can reach 12GB/s read and 10GB/s write speeds. </p>

<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Phison E26 demo drive at CES 2023" class="wp-image-1447987" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/PhisonE26demo.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>A demo drive at Phison&rsquo;s CES 2023 booth.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Phison</p></div>



<p>And Phison, the company behind the SSD controller chips used industry-wide, is showing off its new E26 controller&rsquo;s performance chops through an PCIe 5 SSD engineering sample. It&rsquo;s capable of double the bandwidth and a 30 percent improvement in latency compared to its Gen 4 tech. Phison is also showing off its enterprise controller, which can exceed 14GB/s sequential read and write speeds.</p>



<p>Given Phison&rsquo;s partnerships&mdash;MSI, Corsair, Gigabyte, and Sabrent, to name a few&mdash;a truly ready state for PCIe 5 drives is likely approaching at last. That&rsquo;ll be a welcome development for everyone with big wallets and huge file transfers. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407542/best-ssds.html">Current SSDs are still plenty speedy</a> for gaming and everyday computing, but when time is money, PCIe 5 can&rsquo;t arrive quick enough.</p>



<p>So perhaps a little renewed hope is warranted&mdash;the Q2 estimate for those MSI drives may be a little more reliable than previous promises. But only time will tell.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that Intel&rsquo;s relative lack of experience in the GPU game has made its nascent driver software the Achilles&rsquo; heel of the new Arc line of GPUs. PCWorld contributor Keith May has been <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1424865/intel-arc-driver-performance-a-month-checkup.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">keeping a close eye on the situation</a>, as Intel has opted to follow the usual one-month update cycle. How is Arc looking after two months? That&rsquo;s the million-dollar question in the latest PCWorld YouTube video. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>You can see a full breakdown of the testing setup and all results for launch, month one, and month two in the video above. In short, we&rsquo;re seeing very marginal improvements for most of the newest games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, and <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</em>.</p>



<p>The big surprise&mdash;and I mean big, stonking, HUGE surprise&mdash;is in the improvement in games that use the much older DirectX 9 standard, like <em>Counter-Strike GO</em>. Flat from launch to the first month, the latest drivers approximately double <em>CSGO</em> performance. You read that right: Across low- and high-end graphics settings, we&rsquo;re seeing a 2x increase in frame rates. Performance was also considerably improved on the newer&mdash;but still quite old&mdash;<em>Grand Theft Auto V</em>. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about you, but I&rsquo;m a big fan of Chromebooks. Sometimes all you need is a no-frills machine and most Chromebooks capably deliver on that front. However, with each passing day, we&rsquo;re seeing them evolve and become more than just no-frills machines. </p>



<p>Enter the Asus Chromebook Vibe CX43 Flip. Announced this year at CES, it&rsquo;s one of the few gaming Chromebooks out there in the universe and I&rsquo;m so here for it. Not only can you play cloud-based games on this machine, but the screen also swings around 360-degrees, which means you can use it like a tablet. It&rsquo;s versatile as heck. Let&rsquo;s dive right into the details.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Asus Chromebook Vibe CX34 Flip" class="wp-image-1448349" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Untitled-design-8-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Asus</p></div>



<p>The top-tier model will feature an Intel Core i7-1255U CPU, an Intel Iris Xe graphics, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of PCIe NVMe SSD storage. That&rsquo;s a surprising amount of power. Given the hardware, it should deliver peppy performance. The 14-inch display is nice, too. It has a resolution of 1920&times;1200, an aspect ratio of 16:10 (so much screen), and a refresh rate of 144Hz. That means visuals should be buttery smooth. The display is also touch-enabled and Asus includes a pen with the purchase. The design is rather dazzling, too. The all-white chassis is beautiful and luxurious, and the orange WASD keys and RGB lighting really give it that gamer look. </p>



<p>The Asus Chromebook Vibe CX34 Flip will be available to buy in the first quarter of 2023. No word on pricing yet, though. But when the Chromebook does become available, Asus will be bundling a SteelSeries Rival 3 gaming mouse with it. That&rsquo;s a nice value add!</p>

<p>The Consumer Electronics Show remains a singular event for PC laptop enthusiasts. Aside from Dell, which ditched the show in recent years, every major PC laptop maker is present, and most use it to reveal their best and brightest for the coming year. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444850/amd-launches-mobile-ryzen-7000-cpus-prepping-for-an-ai-future.html">AMD</a>, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1435904/intel-launches-13th-gen-mobile-core-chips-with-endurance-gaming.html">Intel</a>, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1445469/nvidia-unleashes-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-rtx-40-series-laptops-and-more.html">Nvidia</a> also come packing new mobile hardware heat. Dozens of powerful laptops were revealed this year&mdash;but these 10 stood out from the crowd.</p>

<p><strong>Acer Swift X 14</strong></p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Swift X 14" class="wp-image-1448405" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/acer-swift-x-14.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith/IDG</p></div>



<p>Arguably the least glamorous laptop on this list, Acer&rsquo;s Swift X 14 still showcases key trends of CES 2023: the broad reach of OLED displays and newer, quicker hardware from Intel and Nvidia.</p>



<p>Let&rsquo;s talk display. The Swift X packs an optional 14-inch OLED screen with 2,880 x 1,800 resolution and a refresh rate of up 120Hz, as well as VESA DisplayHDR 500 certification. It&rsquo;s a truly gorgeous screen. And though not a massive laptop, the Swift X 14 finds room for Nvidia RTX 4050 discrete graphics and Intel&rsquo;s new 13<sup>th</sup>-gen Core H-Series processors. A high-resolution 1440p webcam is thrown in for good measure.</p>



<p>Pricing is what seals the deal. The Swift X 14 will hit stores in April starting at $1,099.99. That&rsquo;s great value and positions the Swift X 14 as a budget alternative to more expensive 14-inch workstation and gaming laptops.</p>



<p><strong>Acer Predator Helios 300 Spatial Labs Edition</strong></p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="acer predator helios 300 spatiallabs" class="wp-image-1448409" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/acer-predator-helios-300-spatiallabs.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith/IDG</p></div>



<p>Acer SpatialLabs View PCs offer glasses-free 3D on LCD screens&mdash;a bit like Nintendo&rsquo;s 3DS, but larger, and at a much higher resolution. Initially targeted at professional use, Acer brought SpatialLabs to gamers with the Predator Helios 300 SpatialLabs Edition.</p>



<p>Technically, the laptop itself isn&rsquo;t new. What&rsquo;s new is SpatialLabs TrueGame&rsquo;s 3D Ultra mode, which mitigates problems earlier versions of the technology encountered (interface elements and text were sometimes blurred or didn&rsquo;t appear with a correct sense of depth). I had a blast playing <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> on the SpatialLabs display. The glasses-free 3D effect is convincing&mdash;I felt as if I was playing with a fantastic slot car set or guiding a ludicrously fast RC car.</p>



<p>Now, I know what you&rsquo;re thinking: will it work with my favorite game? You can check for yourself <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://spatiallabs.acer.com/truegame/list&amp;xcust=2-1-1448388-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">on Acer&rsquo;s SpatialLabs&rsquo; website</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Asus ProArt Studiobook 16 3D OLED</strong></p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ProArt 3D OLED" class="wp-image-1448411" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/asus-proart-3d-oled.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith/IDG</p></div>



<p>Asus&rsquo; is getting in on glasses-free 3D, as well, with the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1428656/these-new-asus-laptops-may-have-the-best-display-youve-ever-seen.html">ProArt StudioBook 16 3D OLED</a>. It has a 16-inch 3.2K OLED screen with a maximum refresh rate of 120Hz and, like Acer&rsquo;s Predator Helios 300 SpatialLabs Edition, can deliver glasses-free 3D with the flip of a switch.</p>



<p>The experience is similar to that provided by Acer, as both rely on technology built by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.dimenco.eu/&amp;xcust=2-1-1448388-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Dimenco</a>. Asus&rsquo; OLED display does offer some benefits, however, with better contrast and excellent color gamut. I saw both at CES and found Asus&rsquo; image quality superior. Asus seems to be a step behind Acer in game compatibility, though, instead focusing more on professional use.</p>



<p>The ProArt is a real powerhouse, too. It boasts Intel&rsquo;s 13<sup>th</sup>-Gen Core H-Series processors, Nvidia RTX 40-series graphics, and up to 64GB of memory. It also has dual Thunderbolt 4 ports for connecting multiple bandwidth-intensive peripherals and a &ldquo;dial&rdquo; control, which lurks near the touchpad, for quick and easy scrolling through video timelines or color palettes.</p>



<p>The Asus ProArt Studiobook 16 3D OLED will arrive in Q2 2023. Pricing isn&rsquo;t announced.</p>



<p><strong>Asus ROG Zephyrus G14</strong></p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Zephyrus G14" class="wp-image-1448410" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/asus-rog-zephyrus-14.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith/IDG</p></div>



<p>Several Windows laptop makers came to CES 2023 boasting laptops with Mini-LED displays, but Asus&rsquo; ROG Zephyrus G14 is the smallest. This compact 14-inch laptop, which was already among <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/436674/the-best-pc-laptops-of-the-year.html">the best compact gaming laptops available</a>, has found room for a vibrant Mini-LED screen that delivers over 600 nits of brightness and a refresh rate up to 165Hz.</p>



<p>The ROG Zephyrus G14 also delivers the top-tier hardware expected from the Zephyrus model line. This includes up to AMD Ryzen 9 processors and up to Nvidia RTX 4090 series mobile graphics. It also supports USB-C charging up to 100 watts even has a 1080p HD webcam with support for Windows Hello facial recognition login. And, yes, Asus&rsquo; LED matrix display lid remains, letting you show off jazzy animations to anyone nearby.</p>



<p>Asus will announce pricing closer to release, which should be in Q2 of 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>LG Gram Style (16 and 14)</strong></p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="LG Gram Style" class="wp-image-1448408" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/lg-gram-style-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith/IDG</p></div>



<p>LG&rsquo;s feathery Gram laptop line has long been among the lightest available, but now they have style. Seriously! It&rsquo;s in the name!</p>



<p>The Gram Style does look quite ravishing with optional pearl iridescent finish. It&rsquo;s attractive, but not so flashy that it becomes garish. Looks aside, the Gram Style maintains the slim appeal of its predecessors. The 16-inch model weighs about 2.7 pounds, while the 14-incher is only 2.2 pounds, and both measure a tad more than six-tenths of an inch thick.</p>



<p>They&rsquo;re well equipped, too, with Intel 13<sup>th</sup>-gen Core P-Series processors, up to 1TB of solid-state storage, and up to 32GB of RAM. The 16-incher has a beautiful 3,200 x 2,000 OLED display with a refresh rate up to 120Hz, while the 14-incher has 2,880 x 1,800 OLED screen that refreshes at up to 90Hz.</p>



<p>LG says the new Gram line, including the Gram Style, will launch next month, but pricing is not yet available.</p>



<p><strong>Lenovo ThinkBook p16 Gen 4</strong></p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="lenovo thinkpad p16 magic bay" class="wp-image-1448403" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/lenovo-thinkpad-p16-magic-bay.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith/IDG</p></div>



<p>The Lenovo ThinkBook p16 has a little bit of magic. A Magic Bay, to be precise. That&rsquo;s Lenovo&rsquo;s name for a magnetic connector on the top of the display that supports accessories like a webcam, LED light, or 4G LTE modem. The webcam accessory is the start of the show, with 4K resolution at 30 FPS, a 270-degree mount, and built-in privacy shutter.</p>



<p>But the Magic Bay isn&rsquo;t the only reason to like this laptop. It&rsquo;s a durable, attractive, and powerful laptop boasting Intel&rsquo;s 13<sup>th</sup>-Gen Core H-Series processors, Nvidia RTX 40-series mobile graphics, and up to 32GB of RAM. This is a classic all-rounder, capable of day-to-day productivity, photo and video editing, programming, gaming, and just about anything else you can throw at it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s also competitively priced. Lenovo says the ThinkBook p16 will hit stores at $1,349 in May 2023.</p>



<p><strong>Lenovo Yoga Book 9i</strong></p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Yoga Book 9i" class="wp-image-1448407" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/lenovo-yoga-book-9i-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith/IDG</p></div>



<p>I&rsquo;ll be honest: I burst out laughing when I first saw this laptop. The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444656/the-yogabook-9i-packs-a-radical-dual-screen-design.html">dual-screen Lenovo Yoga Book 9i</a> looks a bit absurd in its vertically stacked configuration (can you imagine breaking it out at Starbucks?)</p>



<p>But it&rsquo;s no joke, and there&rsquo;s a lot to like. This is a beautifully sculpted, luxurious 2-in-1 laptop with two stunning 13.3-inch 2.8K OLED screens. They can be used vertically stacked or, more likely, side-by-side. The Yoga Book 9i also supports clamshell and tent modes with the optional to use a virtual keyboard on the lower display or a detachable physical keyboard. The internals include Intel 13<sup>th</sup>-gen Core i7 U-Series processors yet, surprisingly, the 2-in-1 weighs only a hair over three pounds.</p>



<p>The Lenovo Yoga Book 9i will arrive in June 2023 at $2099.99.</p>



<p><strong>MSI Stealth 14 Studio</strong></p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI Stealth 14 Studio" class="wp-image-1448406" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/msi-stealth-14-studio.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith/IDG</p></div>



<p>The all-new MSI Stealth 14 Studio is a looker, sporting an (optional) two-tone vibe, slim design, and clever LEDs that spell out &ldquo;Stealth&rdquo; hidden in the fan vents. It also feels robust in-hand and has a 1440p, 240Hz IPS screen that seems a perfect fit for the laptop&rsquo;s hardware.</p>



<p>So, what&rsquo;s it packing? The Stealth 14 Studio has an Intel Core i7-13700H and equips Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 and 4070 graphics. That&rsquo;s impressive performance for a laptop this size, and the laptop does seem to get toasty&mdash;but that&rsquo;s true of every compact laptop at CES 2023. The MSI can also equip up to 64GB of RAM and 2TB of solid state storage.</p>

<p><strong>MSI Titan GT77 HX</strong></p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI Titan" class="wp-image-1448402" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/msi-titan.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith/IDG</p></div>



<p>Apple&rsquo;s Mini-LED displays give the MacBook Pro 14 and 16 an edge over Windows competitors with bright, vivid screens that pack an HDR punch. But MSI&rsquo;s huge Titan GT77 HX might finally have them beat. It delivers a 4K, 144Hz Mini-LED screen with VESA DisplayHDR 1000 certification, meaning it can hit a peak brightness above 1,000 nits.</p>



<p>Display aside, this laptop is a true powerhouse that leaps ahead of every other laptop on this list. It can be equipped with Intel&rsquo;s Core i9-13980HX, which delivers 24 processor cores, and Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX 4090 mobile. Memory tops out at 128GB of DDR5 RAM and storage support includes up to three PCIe solid-state drives.</p>



<p>The MSI Titan GT77 HX will start at $4,299 when it arrives later this year.</p>



<p><strong>Razer Blade 18</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1445432/youre-going-to-need-a-bigger-backpack-laptops-are-large-and-in-charge-at-ces-2023.html">Razer has jumped aboard the big laptop bandwagon</a> with the new Blade 18, a massive machine that&rsquo;s just a bit less of a beast than its competitors. It packs a 18-inch IPS LCD display with 2,560 x 1,600 resolution and a refresh rate up to 240Hz, but weighs just a smidge over seven pounds and measures .86 inches thick. That&rsquo;s not tiny, of course, but it undercuts most competitors. And while the laptop is large, it can be charged using a relatively compact GaN charger (delivering 280 or 330 watts, depending on the Blade 18&rsquo;s configuration).</p>



<p>The Blade 18 otherwise sticks to Razer&rsquo;s tried-and-true formula for success. It supports the latest Intel 13<sup>th</sup>-Gen processors up to the Core i9-13950HX, as well as up to Nvidia RTX 4090 graphics. Memory stacks up to 64GB and storage up to 8TB, which should meet the demands of most professional creators. Despite its hardware and larger size, the chassis remains sleek and minimalist, and feels luxurious in-hand. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Pricing is luxurious, too. Razer says the Blade 18 will start at $2,899.99 when it arrives in Q1 2023.</p>

## InWin’s radical Mod Free PC case can shrink and grow with your build

<p>One of the core concepts of modern PC building is modularity. As long as you do a little research, you can be fairly certain that you can swap out compatible parts more or less forever. Case maker InWin is extending that idea to the design of the PC case itself, right down to the bones. PCWorld contributor Keith May has a breakdown of the new Mod Free system, live from CES 2023. </p>



<p>At the core of the Mod Free design is a frame that comes in standard ATX and Mini-ITX sizes. It looks pretty familiar if you&rsquo;ve ever seen a &ldquo;test bench&rdquo; setup with no exterior panels. The difference is that these frames interlock together: you can add a front chamber to the ATX size for cooling, or a rear chamber to add space for an array of storage drives. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Modular sections for more parts can be added on or removed without tools in seconds &mdash; you can even chain multiple &ldquo;core&rdquo; modules together to create multi-system arrays. Once your modular frame is in place and your parts are installed, you can add on the exterior panels, which come in translucent acrylic, tempered glass, or cooling-friendly mesh on the concept device. It&rsquo;s easy enough to print your own custom design on the panels with an industrial printer. </p>



<p>At the moment InWin isn&rsquo;t talking release date or pricing, but it&rsquo;s easy to see that this will be a popular option for builders who want absolutely no limits on customization.

## Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 vs. RTX 3080: Which should you buy?

<p>When the Nvidia RTX 3080 10GB was released, there was tremendous excitement for this $699 powerhouse. When it was &ldquo;reborn&rdquo; as the RTX 3080 12GB, with a huge jump in price, the enthusiasm was dampened. The $1,499 RTX 3090 had many questioning whether its price was &ldquo;worth it,&rdquo; but it sold well enough during that time due to its &ldquo;best in class&rdquo; status.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2022, the Nvidia RTX 4080 arrived at $1,199. But the days of extreme GPU shortages have passed. That era propelled the RTX 3000 GPUs to sell in massive quantities at absurd prices. Can the RTX 4080 succeed with similarly absurd pricing?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let&rsquo;s dig a little bit deeper, and compare the RTX 4080 to its predecessor, the RTX 3080. We&rsquo;ll look at the availability and pricing of each in the context of its time, performance for the dollar, and ultimately try to &ldquo;figure out&rdquo; where the RTX 4080 currently stands.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="RTX 4080 vs 3080" class="wp-image-1442775" height="621" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-19-at-2.11.16-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<h2 id="nvidia-rtx-4080-vs-rtx-3080-price-and-availability">Nvidia RTX 4080 vs. RTX 3080: Price and availability</h2>



<p>$699 for an RTX 3080 is great, perfection even. Good luck finding that 99.9 percent of the time during 2020 to 2022, however. The RTX 3080&rsquo;s entire legacy is tarnished by being born in this unfortunate time of the &ldquo;Great GPU Shortage&rdquo; or whatever you&rsquo;d like to call it. It was more likely to cost two to three times its MSRP on the secondhand market for most of its production.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was refreshed as the RTX 3080 with 12GB of VRAM and a few upgraded specs, but it also saw retail pricing over $1,200 initially. The minor spec bump certainly did not justify its substantial price increase, which was caused by everything from lockdowns, to manufacturing delays, crypto-mining demand, and gamer demand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How has the RTX 4080 fared in comparison? It picked up where the 12GB 3080 left off&mdash;with high pricing. The quickly cancelled RTX 4080 12GB came in at $899, which would have been closer to the original RTX 3080&mdash;had it not been a vastly cut-down model not worthy of the RTX 4080 moniker.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Brad Chacos&rsquo; excellent <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1379747/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-tested-5-things.html">review</a>, he immediately pinpoints the problem: It is waaaaaay too expensive. Is it an impressive GPU? Sure. At $1,199 however, it disappoints and scores an &ldquo;own goal.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="RTX 4080 vs 3080" class="wp-image-1442784" height="674" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-11-16-at-5.10.40-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The RTX 4080 has a pricing issue.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>How does this affect availability? The good news is that you&rsquo;re much more likely to find an MSRP retail version of the RTX 4080 across various retail channels in stock. The bad news is that this is because of its poor perceived value, meaning you probably shouldn&rsquo;t buy it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Where does the RTX 4080 versus 3080 stack up in our debate so far? It&rsquo;s a draw, and here&rsquo;s why: The $699 RTX 3080 never realistically came to deliver on its awesome price-to-performance proposition, by being perpetually &ldquo;out of stock.&rdquo; Likewise, the RTX 4080 comes &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo; at a much higher price than gamers are willing to pay, relegating both to the same fate.</p>

<p>OK, price and availability aside, how does the performance of the RTX 4080 fare against the RTX 3080? It&rsquo;s somewhat lukewarm, eclipsed by the ridiculous gains showcased by the RTX 4090. (<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html">Now we&rsquo;re playing with power!</a>)</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="RTX 4080 vs 3080" class="wp-image-1442789" height="911" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/codmw2.jpg.webp" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>We&rsquo;d have to compare the RTX 4080 to the more realistic RTX 3080 12GB that had a similar street retail price, instead of the lofty $699 RTX 3080, which was unobtanium. With the original RTX 3080 10GB, in a game like <em>Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2</em>, you&rsquo;d get a nice bump from 64fps to 98fps at 4K. Non-ray traced <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> goes from 43fps to a more playable 59fps.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="RTX 4080 vs 3080" class="wp-image-1442791" height="923" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/cyberpunk.jpg.webp" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>Very modest, expected generational gains while sticking to a similar price bracket as the 12GB 3080. Compared to the aforementioned $699 RTX 3080, these results for the $500 price increase are disappointing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let&rsquo;s take a step further and play to the RTX 4080&rsquo;s strengths. It has the chops (latest Ai Tensor cores) to handle ray tracing and technologies such as Nvidia&rsquo;s DLSS 3.0 with aplomb&mdash;is it enough?&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="RTX 4080 vs 3080" class="wp-image-1442796" height="930" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/rt-cyberpunk.jpg-1.webp" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>The RTX 3080 managed an unplayable 15fps with ray tracing Ultra at 4K. The RTX 4080 bumps that up to a still fairly unplayable 29fps, effectively doubling the performance. DLSS brings the RTX 3080 to 42fps, and the RTX 4080 to a much better 66fps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the RTX 4080 is now playable at these intense settings, the performance gains are still the minimum we&rsquo;d expect for these prices and generational gains. Alas, the only better option is the beefier RTX 4090&mdash;but that will also cost a good deal more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brad Chacos points out that the RTX 40 series average gain is 30fps, more than the RTX 3000&rsquo;s 20fps gains with DLSS, due to the better efficiency. Still, these are expected improvements and still make the price of the RTX 4080 hard to fully rationalize.</p>



<p>The RTX 4080 is also capable of DLSS 3.0, with Ai Frame generation, a very exciting bit of technology. In supported games such as <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020</em>, you can see massive gains that start to edge the RTX 4080 out against any other GPU save for the RTX 4090. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I tested <em>Flight Simulator</em> on a 5120x1440p ultrawide monitor, on Ultra settings the RTX 4080 got 69fps. When using DLSS 3.0 with Ai Frame generation, this went up to a whopping 151 with DLSS balanced! That is an impressive improvement, and the future looks bright for DLSS 3.0&mdash;with more maturity, it can start to change the narrative on the RTX 4080 performance, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget content creation. In <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1378383/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-content-creation-review.html">Adam Taylor&rsquo;s review</a>, we can see that the RTX 4080 gets a sizable lead versus the RTX 3080 in Davinci Resolve. While your mileage may vary depending on the software you&rsquo;re using, the math may be different for non-gamers when looking at impressive performance gains on the RTX 4080 in some use cases.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="nvidia-rtx-4080-vs-rtx-3080-power-and-other-things-to-know">Nvidia RTX 4080 vs. RTX 3080: Power and other things to know</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="RTX 4080 vs 3080" class="wp-image-1442800" height="820" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-06-at-3.08.59-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>The RTX 4080 has some impressive efficiency for the performance that it&rsquo;s putting out, handily beating the RTX 3080 without compromise. Both share the same TDP of 320 watts, demonstrating how impressive the RTX 4080 is when considering it is often double or more the performance metrics versus the RTX 3080.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, it does have that weird power adapter, and it often shares the huge cooler designs from the RTX 4090. While you may have much more trouble fitting it in most PC cases, one benefit is that on average the thermals and noise performance on the RTX 4080 are also impressive.</p>



<p>While the RTX 3080 never ran as hot as the RTX 3090, it still had GDDR6X VRAM that often performed poorly thermally due to inconsistent thermal pad applications. That problem seems like ancient history with the RTX 4080, which has an overkill cooler for its TDP.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="nvidia-rtx-4080-vs-rtx-3080-the-verdict">Nvidia RTX 4080 vs. RTX 3080: The verdict</h2>



<p>Newer GPUs like the RTX 4080 are always &ldquo;better&rdquo; objectively than their predecessors. Better rasterization, ray tracing, DLSS 3.0, efficiency, the list goes on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Where we come in is in deciding if these technical improvements merit the pricing and actual real-world results.</p>



<p>The RTX 4080 falls short when viewed in its complete form. The $1,199 price pushes it too far outside of any reasonable &ldquo;price-to-performance&rdquo; expectations for an 80-class GPU, and there are many factors at play here. The GPU shortages of recent times caused plenty of problems, including a surplus of RTX 3000 GPUs during this year. DLSS 3.0 and ray tracing are getting more impressive as they mature, so the RTX 4080 has room for improvement here as new drivers release, to be fair.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The RTX 3080 is no prince charming, either. It&rsquo;s $699 MSRP was merely a teaser that almost never saw the light of day, and its more expensive 12GB refresh had minimal improvements to justify the uptick in cost.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What&rsquo;s the verdict? It&rsquo;s a draw, the 80-class of GPUs have too many murky issues surrounding their existence to make either generation an obvious favorite. The favor seems to have jumped to GPUs such as the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html">GeForce RTX 4090</a>, which have unparalleled performance regardless of their higher pricing. Whether we&rsquo;ll get a sub-$1,000 &ldquo;darling&rdquo; GPU that hits price-to-performance hard this year is anyone&rsquo;s guess, but we surely need it!</p>

## Asus’ Noctua RTX 4080 GPU is shockingly gorgeous

<p>Noctua may have a reputation for the quietest, highest-performing PC cooling on the market, but it&rsquo;s known for more than that. Yes, I&rsquo;m talking about &ldquo;Noctua brown&rdquo;&mdash;the distinctive coloring on its fans that sets them apart. Even after a half-second glance, you&rsquo;ll always know it again immediately.</p>



<p>While the internet continues to crack jokes about the Austrian vendor&rsquo;s color choices, many devotees to the company exist. And not just to the quality of their products, but the actual brown aesthetic. That worked out to the benefit of the rest of us, because at CES 2023, Asus just showed off the latest product in its partnership with Noctua. And it&rsquo;s <em>wonderful</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>In fact, the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://edgeup.asus.com/2023/asus-geforce-rtx-4080-noctua-edition-announced/&amp;xcust=2-1-1448154-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Asus GeForce RTX 4080 Noctua Edition</a> may be the only version of this card <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1379747/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-tested-5-things.html">worth recommending</a>&mdash;it&rsquo;s that striking. As with the RTX 3070 and 3080 versions, Asus knocked itself out elevating Noctua&rsquo;s vibe into a thing of beauty. A bronzey backplate and thick cooling fins on the rear and sides lend an air of elegance, while the front shroud is a work of art. The dark brown frame balances Noctua&rsquo;s tan-and-cream fans, and the chrome accents add contrast and fun. The card looks like an owl!</p>



<p>The homage to (and, frankly, loving respect for) Noctua&rsquo;s namesake and mascot is what overrides a natural aversion to the RTX 4080&rsquo;s insane markup. You&rsquo;ll have to check the card out for yourself in the embedded video above, but fair warning&mdash;if you want one of your own, prepare yourself. This card is massive, eating 4.3 slots in height. And given the mystery still around its price and availability, it&rsquo;s probably not going to come cheap, either.</p>

## We asked AMD’s GPU chief about overheating Radeon RX 7900 XTXs

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Earlier this week, AMD confirmed that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1446335/amd-confirms-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-overheating-what-you-need-to-know.html">some Radeon RX 7900 XTX graphics cards suffered from thermal throttling issues</a> due to a defect. The brief statement said that and basically nothing else. So, while Gordon Mah Ung was at AMD&rsquo;s CES 2023 booth, he spoke with Radeon chief Scott Herkelman to get more information. You can see the full conversation below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>First, the good news: Herkelman says there&rsquo;s no safety concern whatsoever with this issue, unlike those <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1372988/heres-what-we-know-about-the-geforce-rtx-4090-12vhpwr-cables-melting.html">melting RTX 4090 12VHPWR cables</a>. So, what&rsquo;s going on?</p>



<p>&ldquo;It all comes down to a small batch of our vapor chambers actually have an issue: not enough water,&rdquo; Herkelman says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very small percentage. That&rsquo;s the root cause.&rdquo;</p>



<p>AMD seems committed to doing right by affected customers, however.</p>



<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve spent a lot of money if you&rsquo;ve bought this XTX made by AMD,&rdquo; Herkelman continued. &ldquo;We want to fix it for you. We have the fix. We&rsquo;re ready to send it to you. Just call our tech support line if you bought it from AMD.com, or if you bought it from one of our AIB partners call them&hellip;We&rsquo;ll ship it to you right away.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Herkelman also confirmed some assumptions about affected models.</p>



<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only on the XTX [boards] made by AMD,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only the vapor chamber. It&rsquo;s none of our partner models. We want you to know that very few people will actually experience this, but those people who do, call us. We want to get you the right product.&rdquo;</p>



<p>So, there&rsquo;s your answer, Internet.

<p>We&rsquo;re finally getting back to normal. Most major PC players returned to the Las Vegas desert for CES 2023 after sticking to the safety of remote events last year&mdash;and they brought some <em>very</em> enticing shiny new tech along with them.</p>



<p>Big names AMD, Intel, and Nvidia all made splashy announcements, and PC manufacturers revealed a barrage of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1445432/youre-going-to-need-a-bigger-backpack-laptops-are-large-and-in-charge-at-ces-2023.html">large, in-charge laptops</a> taking advantage of the unprecedented power. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1446853/10-must-see-monitors-from-ces-2023-on-the-cusp-of-a-revolution.html">Computer monitors witnessed revolution like never before</a>. Heck, we even saw a PC case that <em>breathes</em>.</p>



<p>Yep, CES is back.</p>



<p>No time to sift through all our CES coverage? No problem! Read on for our Best of CES 2023 picks&mdash;the most intriguing and innovative products that impressed PCWorld&rsquo;s staff at the show.</p>



<h2 id="amd-ryzen-9-7950x3d">AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3d pool balls" class="wp-image-1446947" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/AMD-Ryzen-9-7950X3d-pool-balls.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Patrick Murray / IDG</p></div>



<p>The hotly anticipated <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444835/amd-launches-fastest-gaming-processors-with-even-more-v-cache.html">Ryzen 9 7950X3D</a> packs 16-cores and a surprising, potentially very smart design: The special sauce V-Cache is only on one of the chip&rsquo;s two 8-core chiplets. That lets games that like the 7950X3D&rsquo;s performance-boosting 128MB of L3 cache run on one die, while games that aren&rsquo;t fond of cache can run on the standard chiplet at higher 5.7GHz frequencies.</p>



<p>This design, AMD says, essentially gives consumers a &ldquo;best of both worlds&rdquo; CPU that no longer forces gamers to pick between the higher clocks of a non-X3D part or the fat V-Cache of an X3D part. Simply put, the Ryzen 9 7950X3D looks to be the performance CPU to beat in 2023. &mdash;<em>Gordon Mah Ung</em></p>



<h2 id="acer-ekinekt-bd-3-bike-desk">Acer eKinekt BD 3 Bike Desk</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer kinetic bike" class="wp-image-1445806" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/eKinekt-BD-3-Lifestyle-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Acer</p></div>



<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1445699/charge-up-your-devices-with-acers-new-exercise-bike.html">Acer&rsquo;s new eKinekt BD 3 Bike Desk</a> turns the kinetic energy of your pedaling into electric energy for charging up your devices. As a remote employee who likes to stay active during the day, I was immediately drawn to this product.&nbsp;&nbsp;The companion app tracks information like travel distance, calories burned, and so on. You can even charge multiple devices at once, as the desk features two USB Type-A and one USB Type-C.&nbsp;The desk is also eco-friendly thanks to the PCP plastic in its casing. If you have a desk job, this is a great way to exercise while working.&nbsp;&mdash;<em>Ashley Biancuzzo</em></p>



<h2 id="asus-vivobook-pro-16x-3d-oled">Asus VivoBook Pro 16X 3D OLED</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus Vivobook Pro 16X 3D OLED" class="wp-image-1445163" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/asus-vivobook-pro-16x-3d-oled-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Asus</p></div>



<p>The combination of a 3,200 x 2,000 OLED screen&nbsp;<em>at 120Hz</em>&nbsp;<strong><em><u>and</u></em></strong>&nbsp;with glasses-free 3D technology is something that we&rsquo;re already salivating for: the combination of visual quality (infinite contrast! 100% DCI-P3 color gamut coverage!) and a high-refresh rate really is the Holy Grail of content creation&nbsp;<em>and&nbsp;</em>gaming. Pair that with Nvidia&rsquo;s next-gen RTX 40-series GPU, a 13th-gen Intel Core chip, and up to 2 terabytes of storage, and the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1428656/these-new-asus-laptops-may-have-the-best-display-youve-ever-seen.html">Asus VivoBook Pro 16X 3D OLED</a> should be one of the most incredible laptops to ship this year. &mdash;<em>Mark Hachman</em></p>



<h2 id="acer-predator-x45-oled-gaming-monitor">Acer Predator X45 OLED gaming monitor</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="acer-predator-x45" class="wp-image-1446866" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/acer-predator-x45.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith/IDG</p></div>



<p>There&rsquo;s an arms race of high-end gaming OLED monitors emerging at CES. While <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1445207/samsungs-biggest-ultrawide-monitor-yet-will-bust-your-back-and-your-wallet.html">Samsung&rsquo;s new OLED G9</a> takes the crown for the biggest, I think <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1441401/acers-curvy-predator-x45-is-the-ultrawide-oled-to-beat.html">Acer&rsquo;s curvy Predator X45</a> is the one that might just earn a spot on my desk. Its more practical 1440p resolution means it won&rsquo;t break a GPU in half just to render <em>Fortnite</em>, and 45 inches isn&rsquo;t so gigantic that nothing else can fit in your setup.</p>



<p>Plus, just look at the thing. The dramatic 800R that tries to tickle your ears, the bezel that almost disappears into the frame. It&rsquo;s freakin&rsquo; gorgeous, and it even includes a KVM switch for handling multiple machines. And at $1700, it&rsquo;s actually surprisingly okay in terms of value. &mdash;<em>Michael Crider</em></p>



<h2 id="intel-core-i9-13980hx">Intel Core i9-13980HX</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Intel 13th-gen Core mobile Raptor Lake" class="wp-image-1440667" height="710" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/13th-Gen-HX-Processors-Themed-Background-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>13th Gen Intel Core Hx-55W Mobile Chip Image</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Intel</p></div>



<p>Just stop Intel. You had us at &ldquo;24-cores in a laptop CPU.&rdquo; But we admit, we just can&rsquo;t say no to a CPU that cranks out performance 40 percent faster than the already stupidly fast 12th-gen HX-CPUs. And let&rsquo;s not even mention the 164 percent advantage the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1435904/intel-launches-13th-gen-mobile-core-chips-with-endurance-gaming.html">Core i9-13980HX</a> has over an Apple M1 Max in Cinebench R23. We&rsquo;re pretty hot and bothered by this much performance in a laptop CPU. Did we mention it hits a blistering 5.6GHz? &mdash;<em>Gordon Mah Ung</em></p>



<h2 id="displace-tv">Displace TV&nbsp;</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Displace wireless OLED TV" class="wp-image-1447109" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Displace-wireless-OLED-TV.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>During our Displace TV demo, the company&rsquo;s CEO hung this 55-inch 4K OLED TV on the hotel window with vacuum power supplied by the TV itself.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Brown/Foundry</p></div>



<p>TVs are always a big draw at CES. And often it&rsquo;s the biggest ones that grab the most attention. But I was particularly wowed by this 55-incher, which might be standard size but is brimming with innovations. For starters, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/1440866/displace-tv-says-its-wireless-oled-smart-tv-runs-on-batteries.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Displace TV</a>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<em>completely</em>&nbsp;wireless, using rechargeable batteries for power and wireless signals for A/V feeds. It also foregoes mounting hardware in favor of an advanced suction solution.</p>



<p>And lest you feel like this 55-inch 4K OLED panel is too confining, the Displace TV is modular, meaning it has retractable joiners on its edges so you can scale up to 8K by joining four panels. You can send multiple feeds from its remote based station to each screen separately or spread a single stream across all panels. That&rsquo;s a lot of technological leaps and bounds in one product, should it actually make it to market. &mdash;<em>Katherine Stevenson</em>&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="cyberpower-kinetic-360v">CyberPower Kinetic 360V</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Is it cheating to pick the same product as last year? Not possible when the item is this cool. Of the PC cases I&rsquo;ve seen over my career, few have had the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1446954/aw-yes-we-can-buy-cyberpowers-insane-breathing-kinetic-pc-case-this-year.html">CyberPower Kinetic 360V&rsquo;s wildly futuristic, absolutely mesmerizing</a> take on high airflow. It <em>breathes</em>. At first glance, its geometric design and distinctive copper and white coloring seem merely stylish&mdash;then the mechanical wizardry fires up. Watching those small, angular panels on the front automatically open and close to keep your system cool feels like the stuff of sci-fi movies. And CyberPower assures us that we can finally get one of our own this year. Spring 2023 can&rsquo;t come soon enough. &mdash;<em>Alaina Yee</em></p>



<h2 id="nvidia-rtx-video-super-resolution">Nvidia RTX Video Super Resolution</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>You know DLSS, the amazing AI-powered game upscaling technology that supercharges performance on Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX graphics cards? Now GeForce is bringing those dedicated tensor cores to bear on crappy web videos. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1445602/1445602.html">Nvidia RTX Video Super Resolution</a>, which will work on RTX 30- and 40-series at launch and the RTX 20-series at a later date, can intelligently clean and upscale 1080p video to 4K in Chrome and Edge. The proof will be in the pudding but 4K videos remain relatively rare on YouTube, so I&rsquo;m thrilled by the prospect of having a DLSS-like feature make those HD vids look even better on my pixel-packed screen. &mdash;<em>Brad Chacos</em></p>



<h2 id="gigabyte-aero-16">Gigabyte Aero 16</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Gigabyte Aero 16" class="wp-image-1447962" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/gigabyte-aero-16.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Patrick Murray / IDG</p></div>



<p>The Gigabyte Aero line is one of my favorites for video editing laptops (I&rsquo;m actually using one to edit video at the show!) and the updated Aero 16 fixed one of my major problems with previous models. Instead of relying on a USB-C dongle for connectivity in Apple-like fashion, the company brought back a USB Type A port (one is better than none), a full-size HDMI port, and moved the barrel charger to the back. They also added a built in SD card reader, which is certainly welcome, but unfortunately it&rsquo;s only microSD. Maybe next year they&rsquo;ll go full sized.</p>



<p>Of course, the new Gigabyte Aero 16 has been updated with the latest Intel CPUs (up to a Core i7- 13800H) and Nvidia GeForce GPUs up to a RTX 4070. That combination should deliver a <em>huuuuuuge</em> increase in editing performance. Sign me up! &mdash;<em>Adam Patrick Murray</em></p>



<h2 id="acer-ekinekt-bd-3-bike-desk-again">Acer eKinekt BD 3 Bike Desk, again</h2>



<p>The most notable PC-related announcements at CES, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, were a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1446853/10-must-see-monitors-from-ces-2023-on-the-cusp-of-a-revolution.html">new generation of OLED monitors</a>. But that&rsquo;s less a single product than a trackable trend. If there&rsquo;s one thing that made me go &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so gonna buy THAT,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1445699/charge-up-your-devices-with-acers-new-exercise-bike.html">Acer&rsquo;s new eKinekt workstation exercise bike</a>.</p>



<p>The idea of combining a light elliptical workout machine with a computer desk is nothing new, but the eKinekt BD 3 seems to be making a lot of smart choices. Forget about the device charging gimmick, though it would be kind of satisfying to say I charged up my laptop with my puny human legs. No, look at that solid base, the comfy seat: this thing was meant to let you sit and work for hours while getting in some light cardio.</p>



<p>Ready to step it up a notch? &ldquo;Sport mode&rdquo; subtly adjusts the geometry of the desk, allowing you to bear down on the pedals while still catching up on some streaming action. It&rsquo;s a well-thought-out gadget, and at $1K, surprisingly decent in terms of price, too. &mdash;<em>Michael Crider</em></p>



<h2 id="hyperxs-personalized-keycaps">HyperX&rsquo;s personalized keycaps</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="HP HyperX cozy cat" class="wp-image-1441461" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Untitled-design-6-11.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">HP</p></div>



<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1441429/hp-announces-personalized-keycaps-ahead-of-ces.html">These 3D-printed custom upgrades from HyperX</a>, HP&rsquo;s gaming peripherals team, make me squeal with delight because they&rsquo;re just so freaking adorable. The limited edition Cozy Cat keycap, which will be available this month, is wonderfully cute and maybe a little necessary. These add-ons may not offer much in terms of function, but they&rsquo;re fun, especially if you&rsquo;re looking to dress up your keyboard or gaming headset. Sometimes you have to go back to the basics and learn to appreciate the little things in life.&nbsp;&mdash;<em>Ashley Biancuzzo</em></p>

<p>After first being&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/704823/the-new-asus-500hz-gaming-monitor-is-the-worlds-fastest.html">teased at Computex</a>&nbsp;only to never appear in 2022, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1446541/face-melting-500hz-monitors-are-a-thing-now-my-body-is-ready.html">face-melting 500Hz monitors are actually a thing at CES 2023</a>. As a self-confessed sweaty tryhard in competitive games, I am extremely here for it.</p>

But that 500Hz refresh rate is the real draw. Frames win games in esports, and fast monitors help games handle even more responsively. Some misguided people think you can&rsquo;t feel the responsiveness provided by ultra-fast displays, but as the happy owner of a 360Hz Asus ROG monitor I can report that even mousing around the desktop feels smoother the faster your screen goes.</p>

Wow. In fact, Nvidia&rsquo;s new RTX 40-series of GPUs appears to be so efficient that we&rsquo;re seeing thinner, lighter and now much faster laptops than ever before to go with all the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1445432/youre-going-to-need-a-bigger-backpack-laptops-are-large-and-in-charge-at-ces-2023.html">fire-breathing RTX 4090-powered behemoths</a>. &mdash;<em>Gordon Mah Ung</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been slow to jump on the robot vacuum bandwagon after a bad first impression from an early-generation model. Admittedly, that was a loooong time ago.

It vacuums, it mops, it empties its dustbin, it wets its own mop, it cleans itself.&nbsp;<em>And</em>&nbsp;it refines those duties in important ways: Suction power is boosted to 6,000Pa (compared to Roborock&rsquo;s previously high 5,100Pa); a new rubber brush design prevents tangling from pet hair; it&rsquo;s able to lift either dry or wet cleaning element to avoid cross-contact with the wrong the surface; and a drying feature has been added to the self-cleaning process to avoid mold growth.

Its top panel sports a 13.3-inch 1440p OLED touch panel on one side and a 12-inch&nbsp;<em>color</em>&nbsp;e-ink display on the other&mdash;perfect for working on the go. That OLED display will provide sharp, high-res output for image editing and watching videos, while the e-ink display will go easy on battery life when I&rsquo;m writing articles, reading books, and taking notes with the included stylus.

<p>Let&rsquo;s be blunt: CES feels like it&rsquo;s in a bad place after the pandemic. It looks like taking a couple of years off from the biggest electronics trade show in the world has taught companies that, yes, <em>this could have been an email.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Even so, the PC industry didn&rsquo;t disappoint, with blockbuster keynotes from the major players delivering a sneak peek at what&rsquo;s coming down the pipe in 2023. And now that the dust has settled, there are some recognizable PC trends that are worth examining&mdash;most good, some not-so-good. Here they are, in no particular order:&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="monitors-are-getting-insane">Monitors are getting insane&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Call it fallout from a ton of people transitioning to home office, but it looks like monitor makers are set to unleash <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1446853/10-must-see-monitors-from-ces-2023-on-the-cusp-of-a-revolution.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">a hoard of new and eye-catching models</a> this year. And not just in one segment, either. All the gaming display manufacturers are rushing to make <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1441401/acers-curvy-predator-x45-is-the-ultrawide-oled-to-beat.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">premium OLED displays</a> now that the panels are out, but we&rsquo;re also seeing even larger and more ridiculous designs with conventional screens, like Samsung&rsquo;s latest <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1445207/samsungs-biggest-ultrawide-monitor-yet-will-bust-your-back-and-your-wallet.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">57-inch Odyssey Neo G9</a>.&nbsp;On the smaller side of things, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1446541/face-melting-500hz-monitors-are-a-thing-now-my-body-is-ready.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">insanely fast displays with 500Hz panels</a> are coming to the forefront. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="CES 2023 monitors hero " class="wp-image-1446870" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/samsung-odyssey-neo-g9.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith/IDG</p></div>



<p>At the same time, professional and media-focused displays aren&rsquo;t being overlooked. <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8200811-12839518?url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/lp/latest-dell-products#collaborative&amp;sid=2-1-1447444-1-0-0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dell has a 6K Ultrasharp monitor</a> with LG&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/693931/dell-u3223qe-review.html">exquisite IPS Black tech</a>, complete with a high-end webcam and integrated speakers. It&rsquo;s the kind of hardware that can handle Zoom and Blender with equal aplomb. Whatever your setup looks like, you&rsquo;ll have a choice for a display upgrade this year &mdash; assuming you can afford it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="gaming-laptops-are-large-and-in-charge">Gaming laptops are large and in charge&nbsp;</h2>



<p>For a while there it seemed like no one was interested in making a laptop bigger than 15 inches, even if it included discrete graphics and enough thickness to house a wind tunnel&rsquo;s worth of cooling fans. Consider those days over: the big, boisterous gaming laptop is back. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1445432/youre-going-to-need-a-bigger-backpack-laptops-are-large-and-in-charge-at-ces-2023.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Alienware, Acer, and Razer have all revealed new 18-inch models</a> at the top of their respective lines, packed with the latest tech and enough upgrade options to make a Rockefeller flinch.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Dell Alienware M18" class="wp-image-1444643" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/DSC09893.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The massive Alienware M18 offers a huge selection of ports.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>If you want to play Nostradamus, you could point to an ongoing trend away from ultraportable designs and the assumption that users will mostly be playing at home, with an infrequent jaunt to a local cafe or friend&rsquo;s house. But a more likely culprit is newly announced high-end <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1435904/intel-launches-13th-gen-mobile-core-chips-with-endurance-gaming.html">Intel 13th-gen Core HX</a>, AMD <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444850/amd-launches-mobile-ryzen-7000-cpus-prepping-for-an-ai-future.html">Ryzen/Radeon 7000</a>, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1445469/nvidia-unleashes-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-rtx-40-series-laptops-and-more.html">Nvidia RTX 40-series</a> mobile chips that just work better in a gaming laptop&hellip;or perhaps more cynically, just need that extra space for more beefy cooling.&nbsp;These new chips are immensely more powerful than anything we&rsquo;ve ever seen in prior notebooks.</p>



<h2 id="gpus-are-in-a-bad-place">GPUs are in a bad place&nbsp;</h2>



<p>It seemed like the world was holding its breath as the bottom fell out of the graphics card market, just before Nvidia, AMD, and even newcomer Intel announced new lines late last year. Whelp, they&rsquo;re here, and they&rsquo;re underwhelming.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="GeForce RTX 4070 Ti review" class="wp-image-1445644" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>



<p>The response to Nvidia&rsquo;s insanely overpriced RTX 40-series was so bad that they <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1354391/nvidia-cancels-the-controversial-rtx-4080-12gb.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">straight-up canned a high-end card before launch</a>, and its replacement the RTX 4070 Ti <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444726/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">isn&rsquo;t winning any fans either</a>. Though AMD is positioning itself as a more rationally-priced alternative, its <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1431755/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-radeon-rx-7900-xt-review-rdna-3.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">flagship 7900 XTX</a> is facing <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1446335/amd-confirms-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-overheating-what-you-need-to-know.html">widespread overheating issues</a> &mdash; not a good look right before a big CES keynote. And the best you can say about Intel&rsquo;s budget cards is that, well, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1341464/intel-arc-a770-a750-graphics-card-xe-hpg-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">they&rsquo;re pretty good for a budget</a>. They still have a long way to go to be competitive on anything except price.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In short, it&rsquo;s a bad time to buy a desktop graphics card, whether you want power or value. Sit it out for another six months, or if you&rsquo;re desperate, hunt for a bargain on a last-gen GPU.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="where-did-all-those-folding-screens-go">Where did all those folding screens go?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Remember a couple of years ago when everyone was over the moon for folding screens, perhaps in no small part because Samsung&rsquo;s Galaxy Fold phones were starting to get pretty decent? Both <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394141/the-ultra-mobile-lenovo-thinkpad-x1-fold-changed-how-i-work-from-home.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Lenovo</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://ces-a-massive-17-inch-windows-tablet-with-a-folding-screen.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1447444-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Asus</a> debuted folding laptop designs, to a resounding cry of &ldquo;yeah, but why?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus Zenbook 17 Fold OLED - four different positions" class="wp-image-832345" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/asus_zenbook_17_fold_oled.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Asus</p></div>



<p>Fast forward and that small bubble seems to have popped, because manufacturers can&rsquo;t answer that question any better than we can. While it makes sense for a device that fits in your pocket to unfold into a larger screen, if you&rsquo;re going to put something in a bag anyway, there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any reason to fold it in half. Except for, you know, a conventional clamshell laptop design. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444656/the-yogabook-9i-packs-a-radical-dual-screen-design.html">Lenovo is showing off</a> multiple designs with two screens, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1428656/these-new-asus-laptops-may-have-the-best-display-youve-ever-seen.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Asus has one with glasses-free 3D</a>, but this particular gimmick seems to be behind us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For now, anyway. Never underestimate a manufacturer&rsquo;s craving for novelty, just in case it&rsquo;s sitting on the next Yoga or XPS 13.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="do-we-even-need-big-shows-anymore">Do we even need big shows anymore?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>To be honest, the relevancy of gigantic, come-one-come-all technology conferences was diminishing even before the pandemic. Big companies like Apple, Samsung, and Microsoft would rather host their own events to get out the message than spend millions of dollars to compete with everyone else to try and get a journalist&rsquo;s face time in the busiest week of the year. Even Dell, a corporation desperate to move units and headquartered a short flight away, decided to ditch the show this year &mdash; they invited publications to small, guided tours beforehand instead.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="CES show logo display live" class="wp-image-1447467" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ces-logo-live.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">CEA</p></div>



<p>The less consumer-facing parts of the Consumer Electronics Show might remain. Wheeling and dealing of B2B suppliers, smaller vendors showing off their wares at evening press shindigs, among a bunch of reporters who are checking the bowl game scores in between booths. But for the big names of the electronics industry, a trade show is making less and less sense as a place to try and get the attention of the rank and file customer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The CEA isn&rsquo;t going to let its flagship event die next year, or maybe even this decade. But the days of CES as the tech industry&rsquo;s year-starting smorgasbord might be over. And that might be a good thing. Look for companies bailing on the larger, headline-grabbing events like Mobile World Congress, E3, and IFA, in favor of smaller showcases and calculated, YouTube-style presentations. </p>
