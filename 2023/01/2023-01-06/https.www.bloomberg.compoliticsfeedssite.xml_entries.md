KUPIANSK, UKRAINE - JANUARY 06: A Ukrainian tank sits along a street in the town of Kupiansk which has experienced regular shelling from the Russians on January 06, 2023 in Kupiansk, Ukraine. Despite a unilateral Russian ceasefire ordered by President Vladimir Putin, shelling could be heard throughout the day. Kupiansk was occupied by Russian forces mere days after their February 24th invasion of Ukraine, a process hastened by the surrender of Kupiansk's Russia-friendly mayor. Ukrainian forces liberated the town in September, but Russia turned its artillery on Kupiansk while in retreat, destroying buildings and damaging energy and heating infrastructure. Another Russian missile strike occurred here at the end of the year. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)
