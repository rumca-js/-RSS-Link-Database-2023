<p>There are certain things you can’t really demonstrate in the same way as other pieces of consumer electronics. A WiFi-connected urine analyzer that sits in your toilet and samples your pee for analysis is one such gadget. That’s why I had to go to a behind-closed-doors event in a private suite here at CES in Las Vegas to test out this <a href="https://www.engadget.com/withings-u-scan-urine-monitoring-device-ces-2023-010057961.html">prototype version of Withings’ U-Scan</a>.</p><div id="6b5cbe724c1241e39495fbdc2febd188"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>U-Scan is Withings first attempt at a body fluid-analysis device, albeit one with the weight of such a well-regarded brand in the health tech space. The shell-shaped hardware sits on the edge of your bowl like a scent block, and catches a small sample of fluid while you’re micturating. After around a minute, users will find conclusions about their menstrual cycle or nutrition, depending on what cartridge is installed, pushed to their phone.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Regardless of biology, you’ll need to sit down on the toilet to use this thing, and that it’s a little surprising when the hardware lights up when it starts working. You’ll certainly know when it is as well, since it makes a fairly noticeable whirring noise while your sample is processed. At this early stage, I was able to receive information about two stats: The pH of my urine as well as its specific gravity.</p><p>Now, I could reveal what my stats were, but I’d much rather not spoil the video where you can learn a little bit more about how it all works.</p>

## Citizen’s volunteer ‘safety’ app accidentally doxxes singer Billie Eilish

<p>Citizen, the provocative crime-reporting app <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-09-citizen-app.html">formerly known</a> as Vigilante, is in the news again for all the wrong reasons. On Thursday evening, it doxxed singer Billie Eilish, publishing her address to thousands of people after an alleged burglary at her home.</p><p>Shortly after the break-in, the app notified users of a break-in in Los Angeles’ Highland Park neighborhood — including the home’s address. As reported by <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/4axejw/citizen-app-doxes-billie-eilishs-family-home-to-tens-of-thousands-of-people"><em>Vice</em></a>, Citizen’s message was updated at 9:41 PM to state that the house belonged to Eilish. According to Citizen’s metrics, the alert was sent to 178,000 people and viewed by nearly 78,000. On Friday morning, Citizen updated the app’s description of the incident, replacing the precise address with a nearby cross-street.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Although celebrity home addresses are often publicly available (usually on seedy websites specializing in such invasive nonsense), a popular app pushing the home address of one of pop music’s biggest stars to thousands of users is... new. Unfortunately, it’s also just the latest potentially destructive move from Citizen.</p><p>When Citizen launched as Vigilante in 2016, Apple quickly pulled the title from the App Store based on concerns about its encouraging users to thrust themselves into dangerous situations. So it rebranded as Citizen with a new focus on safety, and Apple re-opened its gates. The app began advising users to avoid incidents in progress while providing tools to help those caught in a dangerous situation. Although that sounds reasonable, at least one episode reveals an overzealousness company prioritizing attention and profit over social responsibility.</p><figure><img alt="Visual of three phones showing screenshots from the Citizen app" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/04e8e630-8e0b-11ed-bedc-61ea2e65d902" style="height: 881; width: 1500;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Citizen</div></figure><p>In May 2021, CEO Andrew Frame ordered the launch of a live stream, encouraging the app’s users to hunt down a suspected wildfire arsonist (based on a tip from an LAPD sergeant and emails from residents questioned by police). He offered a $10,000 bounty for finding the suspect, which grew to $30,000 later in the evening. As the hunt continued, the CEO <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3dpyw/inside-crime-app-citizen-vigilante">reportedly</a> grew more frantic, with one of his internal Slack conversations encouraging the team to “get this guy before midnight” in an ecstatic, all-caps message.</p><p>A staffer was ignored in a Slack chat when they warned the team about breaking the app’s terms of service, which prohibit “posting of specific information that could identify parties involved in an incident.” When police announced that night that they had made an arrest, the team celebrated, believing their feverish hunt for notability had led to the capture. The only problem? Citizen had the wrong guy. In Frame’s apparent eagerness to legitimize his app’s purpose with a high-profile citizen arrest, he placed a public bounty on a wrongfully accused suspect.</p>

<p>And we're back. After canceling our CES plans in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/engadget-best-of-ces-2022-200032353.html"><ins>2022</ins></a> (and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2021-las-vegas-cancelled-143036671.html"><ins>not even having the option of attending in person in 2021</ins></a>), the Engadget team sent a dozen staffers to CES 2023 this week, including reporters, editors and videographers. It's too soon to say how many stories and videos we've published — in fact, we have more good stuff coming — but suffice to say, it was a lot. Though our team swears the show still wasn't as busy as pre-pandemic years, they were kept busy enough that it felt like a true return to form, not just for us, but for the tech industry at large.</p><p>One thing that never stopped was Engadget's annual Best of CES Awards program, although this year marks the first time in three years we've been able to base our judgments off of a full slate of in-person hands-on experiences. All told, we're handing out a dozen awards this year, including the most prestigious: Best of the Best. As always, our awards attempt to capture what we think people will still be talking about weeks, or even months, after the show concludes, from wireless TVs to an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/stellantis-first-look-ram-1500-revolution-bev-concept-ces-2023-223035895.html"><ins>electric Ram concept truck</ins></a> to a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ge-profile-smart-mixer-built-in-scale-033643807.html"><ins>$1,000 stand mixer</ins></a> that should make dough blending almost foolproof.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As ever, too, we endeavored to weed out the vaporware, not to mention the things that got attention solely for being dumb.

But for just the good stuff, you're in the right place. <em>– Dana Wollman, Editor-in-Chief</em></p><h2>Best Accessibility Tech: L’Oréal Hapta</h2><figure><img alt="A woman uses the L'oreal Hapta to help appy lipstick." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/235c2d20-8dd4-11ed-8797-9c6ecad414fa" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">L'oreal</div></figure><p>Rather than showing up to CES with a viral beauty gadget, L’Oréal debuted an <a href="https://www.loreal.com/en/articles/science-and-technology/hapta-ces-2023-lancome-innovation/">assistive lipstick applicator</a> that will be useful to millions. The cosmetics company worked with utensil maker Verily, which produces stabilizing and leveling cutlery for people with limited hand and arm mobility, to create <a href="https://www.engadget.com/loreal-hapta-lipstick-applicator-at-ces-2023-080653733.html">Hapta</a>. The result is a sturdy grip-and-gimbal system that lets those with limited finger dexterity or strength more independently apply lipstick. Though there are some quirks the company needs to iron out before releasing the Hapta in December, it’s impressive that this is both a finished product and has a relatively affordable suggested retail price of $150 to $200. It’s also a device that caters to an often overlooked segment of consumers, and can be expanded to work with more makeup applications. Of all the accessibility-related products we saw this CES, the Hapta is the most unique, while being actually helpful. — <em>Cherlynn Low, Deputy Editor, Reviews</em></p><h2><strong>Best Gaming Product: Sony Project Leonardo</strong></h2><figure><img alt="The round accessibility game controller Project Leonardo for PS5 against a white background." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/235c0610-8dd4-11ed-9fdb-2bf5b509d930" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-accessibility-controller-project-leonardo-021032382.html">Project Leonardo</a> is Sony’s first piece of gaming hardware designed specifically for people with limited motor control, and it happens to look pretty neat at the same time. Project Leonardo is a controller kit that’ll work out of the box with the PlayStation 5, offering two circular gamepads lined with swappable buttons, third-party accessory ports and other customizable inputs. The controllers lie flat on a table or they can be mounted on a standard tripod, and they can be paired with a DualSense to turn all three devices into a single gamepad, offering plenty of flexibility for players.</p><p>To build its new PS5 accessory, Sony partnered with advocacy organizations including AbleGamers and SpecialEffect, just like Microsoft did with the (wildly successful) Xbox Adaptive Controller. Project Leonardo represents another positive step for accessibility tech in video games, a market that’s filled with surprises and primed for growth in 2023. — <em>Jessica Conditt, Senior Reporter</em></p><h2><strong>Best Heath &amp; Fitness Product: </strong>Valencell blood pressure monitoring prototype&nbsp;</h2><figure><img alt="A closeup of someone's finger in the Valencell Prototype Blood Pressure Finger Clip." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/235faf90-8dd4-11ed-b5d6-d9ba766ab20f" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valencell</div></figure><p>Valencell has been making optical heart-rate sensors for years, but at CES 2023 it unveiled a new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/valencell-ces-2023-cuffless-blood-pressure-monitor-010017337.html">fingertip monitor</a> that offers “cuffless” blood pressure monitoring. Instead of an unwieldy inflating sleeve, this fingertip clip uses photoplethysmography (PPG)  sensors to measure blood flow patterns. This information is combined with algorithms and the user’s age, weight, gender and height to create a blood pressure measurement, without the need for calibration. We might have seen similar technology in earlier stages of development, but Valencell’s technique of combining data makes for the most compelling device yet. Valencell plans to eventually offer the blood pressure monitor to clinics and hospitals, alongside an over-the-counter version for personal use, pending FDA approval. — <em>Mat Smith, UK Bureau Chief </em></p><h2><strong>Best Home Theater Tech: LG Signature OLED M3</strong></h2><figure><img alt="An angled view of the 97-inch LG M3 OLED with wireless tech sitting in a hotel room in front of a translucent window curtain." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/235f8880-8dd4-11ed-9faf-acd0d01932d5" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>LG unveiled <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-2023-oled-tv-lineup-specs-010035157.html">several new OLED TVs</a> at CES this year, but the standout was the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-signature-m3-oled-tv-zero-connect-160030192.html">Signature OLED M3</a>, a 97-inch 4K giant. What’s most interesting about the M3, however, isn’t its screen – it’s the tech inside of it. More specifically, the M3 is designed to receive video and audio wirelessly, through a separate box that LG says you can place up to 30 feet away from the TV. Outside of a power cord, the M3 itself is cable-free; instead you plug your media streamers, cable box or game consoles into the breakout box, and all of it is beamed over a wireless link.</p><p>The company dubs this wireless transmission tech “Zero Connect” and claims this proprietary standard can provide three times the speed of WiFi 6. Among other connections, the Zero Connect box includes three HDMI ports that can play in 4K at 120Hz, including one eARC port. While it does require line-of-sight to work – there’s a rotatable antenna built into the box – in our brief experience with the set, we found the signal quality remained steady even in a crowded room. If Zero Connect can eventually make its way down to LG’s more reasonably priced TVs, it could provide an exciting new level of versatility. — <em>Jeff Dunn, Senior Commerce Writer</em></p><h2><strong>Best Laptop: Lenovo Yoga Book 9i</strong></h2><figure><img alt="Two of the Lenovo YogaBook 9i dual-screen laptop/tablet hydrid sit open in a light grey void, one with the screens stacked vertically and the other with them side-by-side." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/235e5000-8dd4-11ed-b8f7-fef116ecda7f" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Lenovo</div></figure><p>By axing the traditional, physical keyboard and putting two 13.3-inch OLED screens on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-yoga-book-9-i-hands-on-ces-2023-a-huge-leap-for-dual-screen-laptops-160045296.html">Yoga Book 9i</a>, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=59bdf74a-dd5e-49bf-af3d-ef9ab46255e9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Lenovo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI1OWJkZjc0YS1kZDVlLTQ5YmYtYWYzZC1lZjlhYjQ2MjU1ZTkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGVub3ZvLmNvbS91cy9lbi8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImZiZDI5YzkxLTcyMDUtNGYyNC04ZGNiLWEwMWEwOWI5NTRkZCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAASFmK0_9NgaD21CnHb06fYRKFKim9FFL4pL1XDNS4JBk&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2F">Lenovo</a> could potentially shake up modern laptop design in a way we haven’t seen since the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-01-09-microsoft-surface-pro-hands-on.html">original Surface Pro</a> a decade ago. And while there are some issues that will need to be ironed out, the potential this new design offers is undeniable. When you prop up the Yoga Book on its kickstand, it becomes much more than a standard clamshell. You can have two screens stacked on top of each other or side-by-side depending on your needs. Meanwhile in standard laptop mode, you have the freedom to choose between a virtual or detachable Bluetooth keyboard – both with customizable widgets, not to mention built-in stylus support. It’s a level of flexibility and adaptability that traditional laptops simply can’t match.

<p>Howlin' Wolf would have hated this motorcycle. It is not built for comfort. It is built to accelerate the human body from a standstill to freeways speeds in less time than it has taken you to read this lede.</p><p>This is the $44,900 TS Ultra, the new flagship motorcycle, from venerated electric bike maker Verge. It joins the existing entry level 4.5-second TS (MSRP $26,900) and 3.5 second, $29,000 TS Pro in Verge's lineup. The TS Ultra features a hubless rear wheel housing a 1200 nm (~885 ft-lb torque) e-motor — larger than both the 1000 nm Pro and 700 nm TS — which delivers 201 horsepower, a 124 MPH top speed and a range 233 miles.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Not only does the hubless drive wheel look cool, the space and weight savings coming from that design decision allowed Verge to increase the size of its battery and reposition it to lower the bike's center of gravity. That's handy when you're on a single-seater crotch rocket attempting to extract the fillings in your teeth exclusively via acceleration force. Riders will have their choice of five color choices (in both matte and glossy alternates), three seat materials (basic leather, perforated leather and alcantara), and either a Wilbers or Ohlins suspension.&nbsp;</p><p>Preorders are open on the Verge product page and $1000 will reserve you a bike for delivery in Q4, 2023. Availability in the US is currently limited to a dozen or so states, depending on the local regulations regarding EV sales and imports.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

## NYC court blocks pay raise for Uber and Lyft drivers

<p>A court has blocked a rate hike that would have increased pay for New York City <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/uber/"><ins>Uber</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/lyft/"><ins>Lyft</ins></a> drivers. Uber <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-files-lawsuit-block-nyc-driver-pay-increase-111506195.html"><ins>sued</ins></a> the city's Taxi &amp; Limousine Commission (TLC) in December, claiming it used a flawed methodology to determine the per-minute and per-mile rate increases. Manhattan state court Justice Arthur Engoron agreed. “It’s just not enough to say there’s inflation and 100 drivers said gas prices shot up,” Engoron, a former taxi driver in his college days, said, according to <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/nyc-rate-increase-for-uber-lyft-drivers-blocked-by-court-1.1866722"><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a>.</p><p>In November, the TLC <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nyc-uber-and-lyft-driver-pay-increase-205833433.html"><ins>unanimously approved</ins></a> the city's first metered fare increases in a decade, including for ridesharing trips. Per-minute rates were slated to go up by 7.4 percent and per-mile rates by 24 percent. Under those planned hikes, a trip of 7.5 miles that took 30 minutes would have earned a ridesharing driver at least $27.15, an increase of more than $2.50 compared with current rates.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Uber argued that the rate increases would result in higher fares for customers while harming its reputation. A judge granted a temporary restraining order to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-nyc-raise-blocked-judge-192330738.html"><ins>pause the rate hikes</ins></a> a few days after Uber filed suit and before they came into effect on December 19th.</p><p>“Drivers do critical work and deserve to be paid fairly, but rates should be calculated in a way that is transparent, consistent and predictable,” Uber spokesperson Josh Gold told <em>Bloomberg</em>. “Existing TLC rules continue to provide for an annual review tied to the rate of inflation, which will take place in March.”</p><p>The company said implementing the pay raise would cost it between $21 million and $23 million per month. For the July to September quarter, Uber <a href="https://investor.uber.com/news-events/news/press-release-details/2022/Uber-Announces-Results-for-Third-Quarter-2022/default.aspx"><ins>reported a net loss</ins></a> of $1.2 billion.</p><p>&quot;We call on the Taxi and Limousine Commission to immediately redo the rules so drivers do not have to wait one day longer for their raise. A few missing words in a Statement of Basis and Purpose does not justify denying a raise meant to help thousands of drivers pay their rent and put food on the table for their families,&quot; Bhairavi Desai, executive director of The New York Taxi Workers Alliance, told Engadget in a statement. &quot;Shame on Uber for spending millions on this heartless lawsuit only to deny drivers an increase of $1.66 more on an average trip. Uber woke a sleeping giant. This raise belongs to the drivers and we will not rest until it's back in our hands.&quot;</p>

<p>The most dangerous aspect of a water rescue for first responders isn't the treacherous environmental conditions, it's the terrified and panicked victim capable of pulling their rescuer under the waves along with them. Rather than risk national treasures like David Hasselhoff, the U-Safe self-propelled buoy from Portugal's <a href="https://www.noras.pt/home/">Noras Performance</a> will brave the waves in their stead.</p><figure><img alt="it's a u-shaped aquatic drone designed to sail out to and retrieve flagging swimmers." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/21230200-8e00-11ed-bfff-e8f2aee1707f" style="height: 2268; width: 4032;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Andrew Tarantola / Engadget</div></figure><p>The U-Safe is an aquatic robot designed to drive out to a swimmer in distress using a pair of turbines mounted in its &quot;legs.&quot; The turbines are omnidirectional and operate regardless of the U-Safe's orientation in the water.

## Vive XR Elite hands-on: HTC’s more portable answer to the Meta Quest Pro

<p>Late last year, Meta expanded the limits of consumer mixed reality when it released the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-quest-pro-review-a-next-gen-headset-for-the-vr-faithful-specs-price-130045313.html">Quest Pro</a>. And now at CES 2023, HTC is hitting back with its own take on a flagship headset with the Vive XR Elite.</p><p>Right away, the XR Elite matches a number of the Quest Pro’s highlight specs including support for 2K resolution (1920 x 1920) to each eye, a 90Hz refresh rate and full standalone operation. However, weighing 625 grams (versus 722 for the Quest Pro) and with a more comfortable headband, the XR Elite does an even better job of delivering a breezy portable VR/AR experience. Heck, HTC included the ability to remove its battery and stuff the lens inside a relatively compact canister for traveling. That said you’ll still have to find room in a bag or somewhere else to stash its power pack.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But it was only after I got a chance to test HTC’s headset across a number of demos that I really started to appreciate how much has been packed inside such a small package. Like the Quest Pro, the XR Elite features built-in hand-tracking, so you can easily and intuitively use gesture controls in games. And with support for full-color passthrough, you don’t feel like you’re isolated in the lonely void of VR.</p><p>Also, despite HTC opting for a slightly older Qualcomm XR2 chip (compared to the XR2+ chip in the Quest Pro) I was able to play games like Hubris (which originally launched on PSVR) without the need for help from a computer. Thankfully, you still have the option of tethering to a desktop when you want to run PC-based games or pairing with your phone to watch videos.</p><figure><img alt="One drawback of the Vive XR Elite's design is that there isn't enough room to accommodate glasses. So instead, HTC included diopters can accommodate for some levels of nearsightedness. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/5d318eb0-8dfb-11ed-bd4f-1754accadedd" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Granted, the XR Elite’s controllers still have a ring around the top, which makes them a bit more unwieldy than Meta’s Touch Pro gamepads. But that’s a trade-off I can live with. The two major drawbacks of the XR Elite compared to the Quest Pro is its lack of sophisticated eye and face-tracking, though HTC says it’s working on modules that should address those shortcomings.</p><p>Unfortunately, despite its high points, the XR Elite also shares a lot of the same flaws as the Quest Pro. Sure, starting at $1,099, it’s a bit cheaper than Meta’s $1,500 rival. But that’s still prohibitively expensive for anyone that’s not a bleeding edge enthusiast. But the bigger issue is that with all these new features, it still feels like there’s a lack of content that can take advantage of the headset’s capabilities. Most of the games I played were demos meant to showcase specific features instead of full-fledged experiences.</p><figure><img alt="Weighing 625 grams, the Vive XR Elite is even lighter than the Meta Quest Pro (722 grams)." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/a0bb71a0-8dfb-11ed-b7cf-d80d33d28454" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>There are some annoying quirks too. While I found the XR Elite more comfortable than the Quest Pro, I had a harder time dialing in my IPD (interpupillary distance) and getting the optics as tack sharp as Meta’s headset. On top of that, as a side effect to HTC’s quest for streamlined portability, there’s so little space between the XR Elite’s lenses and your eyes, there isn’t enough room for people to keep their glasses on while using it. HTC tried to combat this by including diopters that can account for certain levels of nearsightedness, but those settings only go down to -6. So while I don’t wear glasses myself, the headset is a much harder sell for those who do.</p><figure><img alt="For those thinking about traveling with the XR Elite, HTC even made a relatively small carrying canister for its newest headset. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/23f95050-8dfc-11ed-a1ff-20efbb192d46" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Ultimately, this means that as impressive as HTC’s smaller and more portable MR headset is on a technical level, it still doesn’t do enough to convert metaverse skeptics into willing users, or at least not yet. But just like the Quest Pro, in a way, HTC had to build the Vive XR Elite for that future to even have a chance of becoming reality, both now and long after the headset goes on sale sometime in late February.</p>

## Russian hackers reportedly targeted three US nuclear research labs

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/russia/">Russian</a> hackers have reportedly targeted three nuclear research laboratories in the US. A group called Cold River carried out a phishing campaign against scientists at the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-brookhaven-electron-ion-collider-134040524.html">Brookhaven</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-18-intel-us-exascale-supercomputer-department-of-energy.html">Argonne</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/first-fusion-reaction-ignition-155212785.html">Lawrence Livermore</a> national laboratories last summer in an attempt to obtain passwords, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-hackers-targeted-us-nuclear-scientists-2023-01-06"><em>Reuters</em></a> reports.</p><p>The efforts are believed to have taken place in August and September, around the time UN experts visited a nuclear power plant in Russia-controlled Ukrainian territory to help <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-kyiv-united-nations-ce8c3e254c8dd44b8ae4eb3cea3c5907">prevent a potential disaster</a> following heavy shelling in the area.

Cold River is also said to have targeted non-government organizations investigating war crimes. It reportedly conducted such a campaign around the time a UN commission said that Russian forces <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/10/un-commission-has-found-array-war-crimes-violations-human-rights-and">were responsible for war crimes</a> and human rights violations in the early days of the country's invasion of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ukraine/">Ukraine</a>.</p>

<p>Well CES is officially underway. The floor is open and hordes of PR reps, journalists and eager entrepreneurs are coursing through the arteries of the Las Vegas Convention Center. Of course even before the LVCC opened its doors today there’s been plenty of news coming out of CES 2023.</p><h2>Sony</h2><p>Sony held its big press conference Wednesday night, covering everything from high-end cinema cameras and nano satellites, to video game movies and accessible controllers. The company’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-accessibility-controller-project-leonardo-021032382.html">Project Leonardo</a> controller will offer a variety of customizable buttons and other hardware in a kit built for those with limited motor ability. Like Microsoft’s Xbox Adaptive controller, Project Leonardo reflects a growing trend in tech, especially in the gaming industry, to better serve those living with disabilities.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Sony announcement that made the biggest splash though, might have been that the endlessly delayed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gran-turismo-movie-trailer-harbour-bloom-ginger-013218031.html">Gran Turismo movie</a> is coming out in 2023. Personally I’m not a big fan of the Gran Turismo series, or racing games in general, but even I got a bit excited watching the trailer. The camera work in the upcoming Neill Blomkamp film is shaping up to be pretty intense.</p><p>And in a weird bit of synergy, Sony also unveiled a car of its own, the newly christened “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-honda-mobility-officially-unveils-its-collaborative-ev-concept-first-look-ces-2023-015133456.html">Afeela</a>” concept which was born out of partnership with Honda. The first Sony Honda Mobility vehicle won’t be ready for the road until 2026 at least.</p><div id="1a0078620c2746e881f1adf70f21ee73"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><h2>AMD</h2><p>AMD also made a splash two CPUs and a GPU. The beefiest of the bunch is definitely the new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amd-ryzen-9-7950x3d-3d-v-cache-033044434.html">Ryzen 9 7950X3D CPU</a> which packs an insane 144MB of cache using the company’s 3D V-Cache technology <em>and </em>reaches boost speeds of 5.7GHz. The other two AMD announcements focused on the mobile side, including the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amd-rdna-3-laptops-radeon-rx-7000-033006886.html">first RDNA 3 GPUs for laptops</a> and a lineup of performance-focused <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amds-ryzen-7000-mobile-cpus-16-core-033046361.html">Ryzen HX CPUs</a>.</p><h2>Razer</h2><p>Another company focusing on raw power this CES was Razer which announced two new laptop models – the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-blade-16-and-blade-18-hands-on-all-out-mobile-powerhouses-ces-2023-180043229.html">Blade 16 and Blade 18</a>. They’re loaded to the brim with high-end components like Intel Core-i9 HX chips and NVIDIA’s top-of-the-line RTX 4090 graphics cards.</p><p>But personally I think the most interesting feature is the Blade 16’s dual mode screen that can run either 4K at 120Hz and peak brightness of 1,000 nits or full HD plus at 240Hz and 600 nits, depending on whether speed or resolution are more important at that particular moment.</p><p>Razer also finally gave us a release date for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-edge-cloud-gaming-release-date-price-190828242.html">Edge</a> cloud gaming handheld which will land on January 26th.</p><h2>Lenovo</h2><figure><img alt="Lenovo YogaBook 9i" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/58cf3840-8df6-11ed-af7f-bc9974d79aa2" style="height: 1050; width: 1750;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford / Engadget</div></figure><p>The biggest dump of news, though, probably belongs to Lenovo. It announced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-thinkbook-plus-twist-hands-on-e-ink-dual-screen-magic-bay-magnetic-160030145.html">two laptops</a>, a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-tab-extreme-tablet-release-date-price-160100798.html">giant tablet</a>, an e-ink notepad and even a “Think” branded phone. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/think-phone-hands-on-motos-attempt-to-woo-big-business-160015927.html">ThinkPhone</a> finally brings some of Lenovo’s enterprise expertise to bear on Motorola mobile devices while the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-smart-paper-e-ink-notepad-voice-notes-160035558.html">Smart Paper tablet</a> syncs handwritten notes with audio recordings, so you can scrub through a lecture and immediately see the notes associated with that moment.</p><p>The most unique device, though, is the dual screen <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-yoga-book-9-i-hands-on-ces-2023-a-huge-leap-for-dual-screen-laptops-160045296.html">YogaBook 9i</a>. Sure, we’ve seen plenty of concept dual-screen machines before, but the 9i isn’t a pipe dream, it’s an actual product that will go on sale later this year. Lenovo will even bundle all the accessories you need to make the most of its form factor, including a foldable stand, a stylus and a bluetooth keyboard.</p><p>You can simply use the foldable as is and pull up a virtual keyboard on the bottom screen, or you can attach the physical one to the screen and use the exposed bit of the display either as touchpad or to show widgets. But you could also set it up as basically a portable dual-screen workstation with the displays either side by side or stacked one over the other.</p><h2>Google</h2><figure><img alt="Android Auto" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/40489310-8df7-11ed-bbcd-54cebf172def" style="height: 583; width: 875;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Switching to the world of automobiles, Google was finally ready to put its major overhaul of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-auto-redesign-whatsapp-calling-180034034.html">Android Auto</a> on display and has started rolling it out to users. The new UI has a split screen mode and puts Maps in easier reach at all times.</p><p>And speaking of Maps, Google debuted a new HD version that will be coming to the Polestar 3.

## MSI made a router with antennas that follow you around your house

<p>There are few things that piss me off more than having a spotty Wi-Fi connection at home, and it seems MSI agrees because the company brought a rather clever router to CES 2023 featuring antennas that dynamically follow specific devices as you walk around your house.&nbsp;</p><p>Dubbed the RadiX BE22000 Turbo, MSI's top-spec Wi-Fi router is packed with pretty much every feature you can think of (and probably some you haven't) to ensure you get the fastest wireless speeds possible. That's because while the standard is still being finalized, not only is the RadiX designed to support <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/what-is-wifi-7">Wi-Fi 7</a> it also includes MSI's AI QoS tech which can reduce your ping while gaming or prioritize different types of content like streaming video at the touch of a button. And with channel bandwidths of 320MHz, MSI claims the BE22000 delivers 4x faster throughput when compared to a typical Wi-Fi 6 router.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Unlike practically every other router, the BE22000's antennas can track devices and adjust themselves dynamically as your move around your home." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/773206d0-8df3-11ed-a077-efbc6be33471" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>But clearly, the RadiX's standout party trick is its antennas, which unlike pretty much every other router out there (aside from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tp-link-router-antennas-automatically-move-wifi-6e-151032290.html">TP-Link's Archer AXE200 Omni</a>), have the ability to automatically adjust their position to follow a specific device as it moves around your home to deliver optimal wireless coverage at all times. And I can tell you, after seeing the router in person, it's kind of mesmerizing.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, before anyone gets too excited, it's important to note that even MSI doesn't expect the BE22000 Turbo to go on sale until sometime in 2024. That's because there are a couple important hurdles like waiting for the Wi-Fi spec to be finalized, along with other challenges like ensuring the motors for the router's antennas can handle months and years of constant operation. Even during the short time the RadiX was on display at CES, I noticed the speed at which its antennas moved became a bit sluggish due to increased heat.</p><figure><img alt="For people who still care about wired internet connections, the RadiX BE22000 Turbo also includes two 10 gigabit Ethernet ports along with four 2.5 gigabit jacks. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/1251e640-8df3-11ed-97ed-8d6f1b52e1ce" /><figcaption>For people who still care about wired internet connections, the RadiX BE22000 Turbo also includes two 10 gigabit Ethernet ports along with four 2.5 gigabit jacks.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>On top of that, I still have other questions like how does the router know which device (or devices) to prioritize in a home filled with multiple gadgets. And what's the repair process like if one of its antenna motors dies? After all, under ideal conditions, routers should be something you can set and forget. And at this point, I'm sure some of you are wondering what kind of person this robo router is really for?</p><p>Is the BE22000 Turbo over-designed? Sure. And while MSI hasn't announced pricing for it either, you can bet this thing won't be cheap. But you can't say MSI isn't trying, and when compared to rival products, a router with automatically adjustable antennas is exactly the type of thing I like to see at CES.&nbsp;</p><p></p>

## New York City public schools ban OpenAI's ChatGPT

<p>On Tuesday, New York City public schools banned <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-reportedly-integrating-chatgpt-technology-into-bing-131502579.html">ChatGPT</a> from school devices and WiFi networks. The artificial intelligence-powered chatbot, released by OpenAI in November, quickly gained a foothold with the public — and drew the ire of concerned organizations. In this case, the worry is that students will stunt their learning by cheating on tests and turning in essays they didn’t write.</p><p>ChatGPT (short for “generative pre-trained transformer”) is a startlingly impressive application, a sneak preview of the light and dark sides of AI’s incredible power. Like a text-producing version of AI art (OpenAI is the same company behind <a href="https://www.engadget.com/open-a-is-dall-e-2-produces-fantastical-images-of-most-anything-you-can-imagine-170056814.html">DALL-E 2</a>), it can answer fact-based questions and write essays and articles that are often difficult to discern from human-written content. And it will only get harder to tell the difference as the AI improves.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“While the tool may be able to provide quick and easy answers to questions, it does not build critical-thinking and problem-solving skills, which are essential for academic and lifelong success,” Jenna Lyle, a spokesperson for New York City public schools, wrote in an email to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/new-york-city-public-schools-ban-chatgpt-devices-networks-rcna64446"><em>NBC News</em></a>. Still, the organization may have difficulty enforcing the ban. Blocking the chatbot over the school’s internet network and on lent-out devices is easy enough, but that won’t stop students from using it on their own devices with cellular networks or non-school WiFi.</p><p>OpenAI is developing “mitigations” it claims will help anyone identify ChatGPT-generated text. Although that’s a welcome move by the Elon Musk-founded startup, recent history isn’t exactly rife with examples of big business putting what’s best for society over the bottom line. (Relying on AI powerhouses to self-regulate sounds as foolproof as trusting the fossil-fuel industry to prioritize the environment over profits.) And artificial intelligence is big business: OpenAI has <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53c2ouY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2NoYXRncHQtY3JlYXRvci1vcGVuYWktaXMtaW4tdGFsa3MtZm9yLXRlbmRlci1vZmZlci10aGF0LXdvdWxkLXZhbHVlLWl0LWF0LTI5LWJpbGxpb24tMTE2NzI5NDkyNzk_bW9kPWFydGljbGVfaW5saW5lIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2NDg0NmQ1Mi05MWJjLTQ1NDgtOThiMC1hZTNmYmFlMjFkOTcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVBpQCtpz7PtrhlG_inrMuav64m12M-oCdEk0vg7r3WG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Fchatgpt-creator-openai-is-in-talks-for-tender-offer-that-would-value-it-at-29-billion-11672949279%3Fmod%3Darticle_inline">reportedly</a> been in talks to sell shares at a $29 billion valuation, making it one of the most valuable US startups.</p><figure><img alt="OpenAI logo displayed on a phone screen and ChatGPT website displayed on a laptop screen are seen in this illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on December 5, 2022. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images)" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/a4c7a9e0-8de1-11ed-97be-5f9e01da029a" style="height: 2303; width: 3543;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">NurPhoto via Getty Images</div></figure><p>Not everyone in the education community is against the AI chatbot. Adam Stevens, a teacher at Brooklyn Tech who spent years teaching history at NYC’s Paul Robeson High School, compares ChatGPT to the world’s most famous search engine. “People said the same thing about Google 15 or 20 years ago when students could ‘find answers online,’” he <a href="https://ny.chalkbeat.org/2023/1/3/23537987/nyc-schools-ban-chatgpt-writing-artificial-intelligence">told</a><em>Chalkbeat</em>. He argues that the bot could be an ally for teachers, who could use it as a baseline essay response, which the class could work together to improve upon.</p><p>Stevens believes the key is to invite students to “explore things worth knowing” while moving away from standardized metrics. “We’ve trained a whole generation of kids to pursue rubric points and not knowledge,” he said, “and of course, if what matters is the point at the end of the semester, then ChatGPT is a threat.”</p><p>No matter how schools handle AI bots, the genie is out of the bottle. Barring government regulation (unlikely in the near future, given the US Congress’ current trajectory), AI-powered answers, essays and art are here to stay. The next part, dealing with the potential societal fallout — including the automation of more and more jobs — will be where the real challenges begin.</p>

They'll also act as Matter hubs, allowing Matter-enabled devices to connect and work together harmoniously. Matter support has already rolled out to many of the newer Google, Amazon and Apple devices, with more brands coming on board soon.</p><h2>Samsung Pro Plus MicroSD card</h2><p></p><p>Here's a great deal on a useful item for your cameras, phones and gaming handhelds.

## LG Display's latest foldable OLED can bend in both directions

<p>When we first started seeing foldable device concepts a few years back, I was intrigued but not particularly impressed. Many of those early prototypes felt very much like experiments: they were often bulky and the bendy displays seemed fragile. And there were <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-15-samsung-galaxy-fold-hands-on-price-release-date.html">creases</a>.</p><p>Thankfully, display tech has come a long way in just a few years. That was particularly evident at LG Display’s booth at CES this year, where the company showed off two new mobile OLED concepts:  a 17-inch laptop/tablet and an 8-inch smartphone-like device that can fold in two directions.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The 17-inch device is far from the first foldable tablet we’ve seen, but LG Display claims this one is “<em>almost </em>entirely crease-free.” We looked at it pretty closely, and there was a visible seam along the fold, but it was very difficult to detect when the tablet was fully extended. And there wasn’t any kind of rippling or gap that we sometimes see with foldables. Moreover, LG says the display was tested for up to 50,000 folds, so it should be pretty durable.</p><div id="9cfee36a478d42cd8d6cbcf481f6f0b7"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>The other concept was something LG Display officially calls the “360-degree Foldable OLED,” an 8-inch display that looks a lot like Samsung’s Galaxy Fold, but folds in both directions. So, in addition to folding it closed, you can also fold it outwards, with the two displays in a sort of tent shape.</p><p>LG Display says these “360-degree” abilities could potentially allow an eventual device to be used in multiple different modes. Of course it would also depend on hardware makers and app developers to decide how take advantage of the functionality, but it’s interesting to think about how you might want to use a phone when it’s folded in the <em>other</em> direction.</p><p>Of course, two-way folding also requires a more durable display and LG says it’s delivered on that as well. According to the company, the 360-degree foldable is rated for 200,000 folds and is stronger than comparable foldable devices currently on the market. So while we don’t yet know for sure if companies like Samsung are going to pursue phones with these two-way folding abilities, LG Display has shown that such a device could be a lot closer than we think.</p>

## The adorable Loona petbot is ready to roll into even the coldest of hearts

<p>Humans, we’re a sociable bunch. To that end, we’re pre-programmed to develop technology that helps us stay connected with others. Sometimes, though, the connection can be with the technology itself. Enter Loona, the adorable pet robot that will either melt your heart or, at the very least, serve as a loyal smart home companion (or hopefully both).</p><p>Loona appears to be the exact halfway point between the adorableness of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-26-anki-cozmo-code-lab.html"><ins>Anki’s Cozmo</ins></a> and Amazon’s high-end <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-is-expanding-the-astros-abilities-for-both-home-and-business-164612943.html"><ins>Astro homebot</ins></a>. There’s definitely a focus on younger users here, but kids of “all ages” might find themselves sucked in by her charms. Loona has apparently also been designed to interact well with any analog pets you may already have.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Armed with a 3D camera and edge sensors for navigating your home, Loona also has a regular camera for face detection and object recognition. There are four microphones that provide Loona the ability to locate you as you beckon her and touch sensors so she’ll lean into your head-strokes with eerily biological authenticity. At launch it’ll respond to a slew of verbal commands and gestures, and the company claims new ones will continuously be added. There will also be a graphical programming tool so you can create your own interactions and a community to share them with.</p><figure><img alt="An animated image of the Loona pet robot having its chin stroked." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/2a666ce0-8deb-11ed-a7bb-dccd0fef4e15" style="height: 270; width: 480;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">KEYi Robotics</div></figure><p>One of the more endearing features is Loona’s expressive personality. Loona’s digital eyes are surprisingly articulate and feel like they are right out of a Disney movie. The company indicated that there could also be the option to add custom expressions and emotions further down the line.</p><p>Beyond being a digital pet, Loona can also double as a home security and monitoring system. The benefit being you can direct her around your abode and find where your IRL cat is hiding unlike static pet-cams where you (and I say this from experience) might ruin a weekend away driving back because you haven’t seen your cat appear for two whole days and you’re worried but it turns out she was just sleeping in one spot the entire time. With Loona, not a problem.</p><p>Loona was originally launched on Kickstarter securing over three million dollars in backing which, if nothing else, shows that there’s a lot of interest in this category. The robots are now shipping to backers with general availability on track for the end of this month at the <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/petbot-loona-a-pet-a-robot-a-friend#/"><ins>company’s website</ins></a> where it will retail for $449. If you’re extra keen you can pick one up now via the Kickstarter page for $359.</p>

## Dolby Atmos for cars hands-on: Immersive spatial audio hits the road

<p>Dolby Atmos for cars was first announced for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lucid-air-ev-dolby-atmos-160018074.html">Lucid Air</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-benz-dolby-atmos-music-204555703.html">select Mercedes models</a> in 2021. But with the immersive audio making it to luxury automobiles in the US last month, the company is showing off the setup here at CES 2023 with in-car demos. We got our first listening session in the backseat of a Mercedes-Maybach S 580.&nbsp;</p><p>First, let me explain a bit about the car. This Maybach is equipped with a Burmester 4D sound system with 30 total speakers, six of which are in the ceiling. Think of those as playing the role of upfiring drivers in your Atmos soundbar. Amplifiers deliver 1,750 watts of power and both front- and trunk-mounted subs handle the bass (the trunk sub has its own 400-watt amp too). It's a completely insane setup installed in a $185,000 car.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The immersive sound is so impressive, it even manages to upstage its lavish setting. It's great for pop tunes like The Weeknd, but much like an Atmos system in your home, the in-car version really shines with genres like jazz. When listening to &quot;So What&quot; from Miles Davis' <em>Kind of Blue, </em>it felt like I was in a club. In the backseat, the drums were to my right while the horns were up by the driver and so on. The sensation was like sitting in the middle of all the musicians while they did their thing. As someone who has tested several Atmos home theater setups, I was still surprised by the results here. Of course, this is a crazy sound system in high-end luxury car, likely the best iteration of this type of Dolby automotive collab.</p><div id="1613cf65fc6d476e960802dfb315067f"></div><p>Right now, the bulk of the content is audio. Simply link your streaming service of choice, so long as it offers Dolby Atmos Music spatial audio, and you're all set. The infotainment system in the Maybach had all of the compatible tunes clearly labeled as to which were Atmos. Dolby says there are some companies offering a/v uses, so movies and shows with the immersive audio would sync up with an in-car setup just fine. The company's senior vice president of entertainment John Couling explained during the demo that he anticipated people would watch movies mapped in Dolby Atmos while their EV charged, for example.</p><p>Dolby says Atmos was designed to be scalable from the start, so just like it has for soundbars, the audio platform can be configured for more run-of-the-mill speaker setups in more affordable cars. We're talking four-channel, six-speaker arrangements. It wasn't so long ago that Atmos was reserved for only premium soundbars and now it's available on things like the Sonos Beam via virtualization. So even though a family car or minivan may not have the ceiling-mounted overhead speakers a Mercedes does, immersive audio won't be out of the question. Much like it's interesting to see how more budget-friendly speakers handle Atmos, I'm looking forward to hearing what a virtualized version sounds like in a Honda Civic.&nbsp;</p><p>Dolby Atmos is currently available on the Lucid Air and Mercedes-Maybach S-Class, as well as the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, EQE, EQE SUV, EQS and EQS SUV. Volvo has already announced that Atmos will be available on the Bowers &amp; Wilkins sound system in the EX90 SUV. The EV will be the first Volvo to have Dolby's immersive audio inside. The Polestar 3 also packs an Atmos-equipped Bowers &amp; Wilkins setup and it's due to arrive later this year. The Plus pack specifically includes a 25-speaker system for this task. Lotus has also announced a collaboration with Dolby, bringing Atmos to the KEF setup inside the Eletre EV that's due to debut in 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's almost time for the 2023 edition of the week-long Awesome Games Done Quick (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/agdq/"><ins>AGDQ</ins></a>) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/speedrun/"><ins>speedrunning</ins></a> marathon. This year's event takes place between January 8th and January 15th. As ever, AGDQ will showcase a bunch of skilled players racing to finish games as quickly as they can. Runners will go head-to-head in some games and we might see world records being broken too.</p><p>For the third year in a row, AGDQ will take place entirely online. The event was scheduled to take place in Florida with a live audience, but organizers decided against that plan due to the state's "continued disregard for COVID-19’s dangers (including anti-mandate vaccination policies) and an increased aggression towards LGBTQ+ individuals." They said that "we do not believe it is a safe place for our community at this time," but relocating to a "safer location" wasn't financially feasible. That means speedrunners won't have an in-person crowd to cheer them on.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As always, <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule"><ins>the schedule</ins></a> is full of some intriguing runs. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/stray/"><em><ins>Stray</ins></em></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cult-of-the-lamb-devolver-release-date-223042486.html"><em><ins>Cult of the Lamb</ins></em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/neon%20white/"><em><ins>Neon White</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>(a game that's all about speedrunning) are among the recent titles making their first appearances at AGDQ. A bunch of fan-favorite games are in the mix too, including <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, <em>Cuphead</em> and <em>Portal</em>.</p><p>I'm looking forward to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-shredders-revenge-review-185022231.html"><em><ins>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>run, as well as watching a crew of six players cleaning a bunch of vehicles in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/powerwash-simulator-mental-health-research-wellbeing-201523276.html"><em><ins>PowerWash Simulator</ins></em></a> as quickly as possible. I'm also curious about a run for a game called <em>I'm going to die if I don't eat sushi!</em>, which I simply had to buy after seeing it on the schedule. Unless it's added as a bonus game, though, there's no <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/elden%20ring/"><em><ins>Elden Ring</ins></em></a> this time around.</p><p>AGDQ is once again raising funds for Prevent Cancer Foundation. The 2022 edition <a href="https://www.engadget.com/awesome-games-done-quick-2022-charity-record-212418233.html"><ins>brought in a record $3.4 million</ins></a> for that cause.

## The FCC wants carriers to notify you sooner when there's a data breach

<p>The Federal Communications Commission isn't done dragging data breach policy <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fcc-data-breach-reporting-requirements-204349123.html">into the modern era</a>. The agency has <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-modernize-data-breach-rules">proposed</a> rules that would improve reporting for breaches at carriers. Most notably, the move would scrap a mandatory wait of seven business days before a telecom can warn customers about a security incident. Hackers would have a shorter window of opportunity to abuse your data without your knowledge, to put it another way.</p><p>The proposal would also clarify that carriers must notify the FCC, FBI and Secret Service of any reportable data breaches. Providers would likewise have to alert customers to inadvertent breaches, such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-25-t-mobile-att-pin-vulnerability.html">leaving account info exposed</a>. The Commission is simultaneously asking for public input on whether or not breach alerts should include specific information to help people take action. such as the nature of the compromised data.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The FCC isn't shy about its reasoning behind the tentative rule change. The existing rules are more than 15 years old, and are reportedly &quot;out-of-step&quot; at a time where it's frequently vital to notify victims and authorities as quickly as possible. In theory, telecoms will warn users sooner and reduce the chances of identity fraud and follow-up hacks. This won't guarantee timely alerts, but it could minimize the damage for both customers and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-350-million-settle-lawsuits-massive-data-breach-132048591.html">networks' bottom line</a>. It's also more consistent with other laws on breach reporting, particularly in states like California.</p><p>There are potential problems. The proposed rule change would let federal agencies delay customer warnings for an initial period of up to 30 days if the notice might jeopardize a criminal investigation or national security. That could put the general public at risk. The FCC is also wondering whether or not there should be a ceiling on the notification period, and whether smaller carriers should get more time to report intrusions. Public comments (open 30 days after the proposal reaches the Federal Register) may help shape these rules, but there's no guarantee the end result will address every concern.</p>

## What we bought: I sold my car and bought this e-bike instead

<p>To be clear, I still own a car. While I might wish I were hardcore enough to live car-free, I’m not. But instead of owning two or more vehicles (like <a href="https://data.census.gov/table?tid=ACSDP5Y2021.DP04&amp;hidePreview=true">most</a> American households do), my family now just has one. We bought the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5yYWRwb3dlcmJpa2VzLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy9yYWRydW5uZXItcGx1cy1lbGVjdHJpYy11dGlsaXR5LWJpa2UiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImFiOGYzNzBiLWY3N2MtNDU0Ni1iY2Y0LTM2N2Q4OGQ1YjFmOSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAZF7qahQ96clquIe5CCnpbKEfoWqlaCnDHXqMxawEdYo&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.radpowerbikes.com%2Fproducts%2Fradrunner-plus-electric-utility-bike">RadRunner Plus</a> from Rad Power Bikes after we sold our second car, but I should note that two factors made that move feasible: My husband and I both started working from home, and we moved to a neighborhood that’s only a three-minute walk from our kid’s school. So if I feel a touch of pride in swapping a car for an e-bike, I realize I’m in a fortunate situation that doesn’t apply to everyone.</p><p>That said, this bike is rad. It’s fun to ride, it can carry a lot of cargo and takes on hills with seemingly zero effort. I feel like what keeps more people from adopting the bike as a routine form of transport are sweatiness and cargo space. No one wants to show up wherever they’re going looking like they just got out of a sauna, and most of us need to carry around more stuff than what fits in a small bag. The RadRunner solves both issues. If you don't want to pedal a single stroke, the throttle and 750-watt motor will oblige. If you need space for your kid, your coffee and a bag of groceries, you can configure the bike to handle them all at once (though the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5yYWRwb3dlcmJpa2VzLmNvbS9jb2xsZWN0aW9ucy9hY2Nlc3NvcmllcyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYWI4ZjM3MGItZjc3Yy00NTQ2LWJjZjQtMzY3ZDg4ZDViMWY5In0&amp;signature=AQAAAUDumV_Y-EL_7AG1vvGUdBN1F-NY0SB6q3r4NEL_rIY5&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.radpowerbikes.com%2Fcollections%2Faccessories">accessories</a> are going to cost you).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Rad Power Bikes RadRunner Plus" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/9f7f1b90-7be8-11ed-af3f-473668002fc1" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amy Skorheim / Engadget</div></figure><p>Rad Power offers three cargo bikes: the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5yYWRwb3dlcmJpa2VzLmNvbS9jb2xsZWN0aW9ucy9lbGVjdHJpYy1jYXJnby11dGlsaXR5LWJpa2VzL3Byb2R1Y3RzL3JhZHJ1bm5lci1lbGVjdHJpYy11dGlsaXR5LWJpa2UiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImFiOGYzNzBiLWY3N2MtNDU0Ni1iY2Y0LTM2N2Q4OGQ1YjFmOSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAWHDQR1cVtuZMoZ0DVoBtaLMIY6b_GALt9LuT8E81LlA&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.radpowerbikes.com%2Fcollections%2Felectric-cargo-utility-bikes%2Fproducts%2Fradrunner-electric-utility-bike">RadRunner 2</a>, the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5yYWRwb3dlcmJpa2VzLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy9yYWRydW5uZXItcGx1cy1lbGVjdHJpYy11dGlsaXR5LWJpa2UiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImFiOGYzNzBiLWY3N2MtNDU0Ni1iY2Y0LTM2N2Q4OGQ1YjFmOSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAZF7qahQ96clquIe5CCnpbKEfoWqlaCnDHXqMxawEdYo&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.radpowerbikes.com%2Fproducts%2Fradrunner-plus-electric-utility-bike">RadRunner Plus</a> and the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5yYWRwb3dlcmJpa2VzLmNvbS9jb2xsZWN0aW9ucy9lbGVjdHJpYy1jYXJnby11dGlsaXR5LWJpa2VzL3Byb2R1Y3RzL3JhZHdhZ29uLWVsZWN0cmljLWNhcmdvLWJpa2UiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImFiOGYzNzBiLWY3N2MtNDU0Ni1iY2Y0LTM2N2Q4OGQ1YjFmOSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAbF9SUbfxlr3rN70HOHaMLYcIfMlNLJv4d7NSJf7D67Q&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.radpowerbikes.com%2Fcollections%2Felectric-cargo-utility-bikes%2Fproducts%2Fradwagon-electric-cargo-bike">RadWagon</a>. They all have a 45-mile range, a 750-watt motor and an integrated rear rack. The Runner 2 and the Runner Plus are the same size, while the Wagon has an extended (and noticeable) rear rack. When I was first thinking about investing in an electric bike, I saw someone riding one around town with a huge orange rear rack that provided enough room for two school-age kids on the passenger seat. Turns out that was a RadWagon, and while I ultimately went for the smaller Plus model, I’m glad that my Wagon sighting led me to investigate the brand further.</p><p>The decision to go for the smaller model was easy (I don’t have two kids or carry all that much stuff), but deciding between the RadRunner 2 and the RadRunner Plus was a little tougher. The former costs $1,500, which is expensive enough, and the Plus adds another $400 to the sticker price. The biggest difference is probably the drivetrain, with a single speed on the Runner 2 and seven speeds on the Plus. The Plus also comes with a cushioned back seat, fenders, an improved headlamp and a control panel with a display that includes an odometer, current speed, battery life and pedal assist levels (the control panel on the 2 doesn’t have a display). The Plus also comes in silver, and it’s very possible that color was the final deciding factor for me.</p><figure><img alt="Rad Power Bikes RadRunner Plus LED Display" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/f51e9f40-7be7-11ed-bfff-86b2a9420a31" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amy Skorheim / Engadget</div></figure><p>Before pushing the buy button, I did take a cursory glance at other brands, but no one else seemed to match the level of enthusiasm Rad Power owners put into their reviews. I also liked the large number of accessories they offer. (I’m a sucker for accessories.)

I haven’t installed the front basket yet (it requires some light brake rewiring and I just haven’t gotten around to it).

Rad Power recommends consulting a bike repair person to help, but that wasn’t necessary for me. I liked that the battery came charged enough to get a few rides in. After paying $1,800, it would have been a bummer to have to wait to play with my new toy.</p><figure><img alt="Rad Power Bikes RadRunner Plus rear drivetrain" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/410a0c00-7be8-11ed-96b9-03a2673ebb03" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amy Skorheim / Engadget</div></figure><p>Riding it takes a little adjustment if you’re accustomed to a manual road or gravel bike. First of all, your riding position changes. If you tend to adopt the aggressive, forward-leaning bike messenger position, it might feel a little odd to sit so upright. I’ll admit I felt a little “uncool” the first time I rode it. But that feeling disappeared once I started thinking of the Plus as a moped rather than a bike – more like <em>Roman Holiday</em>, less like <a href="https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/Miss_Gulch">Miss Gulch</a>.</p><p>The motor kicks in after a half turn of the pedals and you can increase your pedal assist from the light push of a level one to a very zippy level four. There’s also the throttle, which pushes you along with zero pedaling on your part. I find that I use the throttle most after coming to a full stop, particularly at intersections. It engages immediately and quickly propels the bike forward, getting me across traffic safely, with none of the slow start up you have to muscle through on a regular bike. Once going, I mostly rely on pedal assist levels two and three to keep the pace. One thing I noticed is that this bike does <em>not</em> coast. That’s not surprising as it weighs over 75 pounds and has 3.3-inch wide tires, but pedaling more or less constantly made me modify my riding style.</p><p>Turns are a little different as well. Where you might feel like a cohesive unit on a road bike, leaning into the turns Tour de France-style, on the Plus, turns are a two-step process: you turn the wheel, then you go in that direction. I was a little wobbly at first but here, too, I got the hang of it. With all that power behind you, it’s nice to know the brakes are solid. There were times when I got going around 25 miles per hour, and the brakes brought me to a stop in a way I felt was safe. I should note that after you reach 20 miles per hour, you won’t get any sort of motor assist. That’s because Rad Power bikes are limited to comply with the legal limits for e-bikes in many states.</p><figure><img alt="Rad Power Bikes RadRunner Plus" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/7c5863b0-7be8-11ed-bbfc-9657db897ed9" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amy Skorheim / Engadget</div></figure><p>In the end, the little differences are just things to get used to, and I got acclimated pretty quickly – especially when facing a 250-foot elevation gain over the course of a ride. I was a little disappointed when I realized the 300-pound weight limit means that my husband and I will never be able to ride the same bike together. Given that I don’t know many couples with a combined weight of under 300 pounds, I feel like this might be true for many adults over 30. Still, this bike has opened up an ideal alternate form of transportation, one in which I can carry lots of cargo plus a kid, while getting only minimally sweaty.</p>

## First ever UK space flight set for January 9th

<p>In a few days, the first orbital space flight <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uk-space-flights-are-one-step-closer-after-regulator-approves-virgin-orbit-licenses-112502954.html">taking off from UK soil</a> might be launching from Spaceport Cornwell. Virgin Orbit has announced that the initial window for its historic &quot;Start Me Up&quot; mission will open on January 9th, Monday, at 22:16 UTC (5:15PM Eastern Time). If the launch needs to be pushed back due to technical issues or inclement weather conditions, the company has back-up dates lined up throughout the month.&nbsp;</p><p>The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) approved the licenses Virgin Orbit needs to perform launch activities in the UK back in December, following its approval of Spaceport Cornwall's first launch license. Virgin Orbit is working with the United Kingdom Space Agency (UKSA), Cornwall Council and the Royal Air Force for this mission.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Seeing as Start Me Up is the &quot;first&quot; in several ways — it's also the first international launch for Virgin Orbit, as well as the first commercial launch from western Europe — the private space corp said it will &quot;maintain a conservative posture with regard to system health, weather, and all other elements of scheduling.&quot; That ups the probability of a delay, unless everything falls into place for Virgin Orbit on Monday. Even so, the LauncherOne orbital launch vehicle that will be used for this mission is now attached to Cosmic Girl, the Boeing 747 aircraft that will serve as its first stage launch platform. The company had to transport LauncherOne, which was manufactured in Long Beach, California, to the UK to make the journey possible.</p><div id="380c8a3de2044eac92fe85d5e51da1f4"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">The little—actually, big—rocket that could 🚀 In preparation for our first-ever overseas launch <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StartMeUp?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#StartMeUp</a>, we had to figure out a way to safely transport our rocket across the world.

## The Morning After: Lenovo made an e-ink tablet to rival Amazon’s Scribe

<p>The CES conveyor belt of PCs doesn’t let up. Lenovo has been busy. Let’s start with its latest YogaBook, the dual-screen <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-yoga-book-9-i-hands-on-ces-2023-a-huge-leap-for-dual-screen-laptops-160045296.html">YogaBook 9i</a>. Instead of folding like a conventional laptop, this… thing unfurls a screen atop another, with a slimline keyboard at the bottom. Thankfully, as well as the keyboard and stylus accessories, there’s a kickstand to ensure those two 13.3-inch 2.8K OLED displays stay in place. There’s an incredible amount of flexibility here. You can have the screens unfolded like a book, stacked atop each other or as a classic laptop, with the lower screen showing the keyboard.</p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-yoga-book-9-i-hands-on-ces-2023-a-huge-leap-for-dual-screen-laptops-160045296.html"><figure><img alt="TMA" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/f28fd7a0-8dba-11ed-bbdc-a31b18e436b1" style="height: 405; width: 675;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure></a><p>Then there’s the $400 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-smart-paper-e-ink-notepad-voice-notes-160035558.html">Smart Paper tablet</a>. An unashamed stab at rivaling Amazon’s Scribe e-ink tablet, there’s a screen to write and annotate on and a battery-less stylus you can holster in the case. There are nine pen settings (such as pencil, ballpoint and marker) and over  4,000 pressure sensitivity levels to ensure your sketches come out as you intended. Lenovo’s Smart Paper can convert your handwriting into text, and you can use keyword searches to find what you’re looking for – something Amazon’s version lacks. Conversely, though, Lenovo won’t have the library of Kindle books to scribble notes on – these are two distinct offerings.</p><p>Oh, you wanted a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-thinkbook-plus-twist-hands-on-e-ink-dual-screen-magic-bay-magnetic-160030145.html"><ins>twist</ins></a>?

## Tesla brings back the option of a round steering wheel for the Model S and X

<p>When Tesla started offering a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-model-s-redesign-interior-221606865.html">yoke steering wheel</a> in Model X and Model S EVs, CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/fredsterrrr/status/1418476050925985794">rejected</a> the idea of a more conventional option. Now, the company has indeed brought back the round steering wheel as an option in the configurator, <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/01/05/tesla-offers-round-steering-wheel-model-s-x/"><em>Electrek</em></a> has reported. Selecting it doesn't appear to change the price or delivery time.</p><p>If you already bought a Tesla Model S or X with a yoke and don't like it, you have options, too. As <a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/1611194269854834688">pointed out</a> by YouTuber and Tesla owner Marques Brownlee, the company is <a href="https://shop.tesla.com/product/model-s_x-steering-wheel-retrofit?web=true">now offering a $700 option</a> to replace the yoke with a round steering wheel. &quot;This retrofit is only compatible with Model S and Model X vehicles configured with a Yoke Steering Wheel. Purchase price includes installation through Tesla Service,&quot; Tesla notes. It adds that the wheel has &quot;no stalks or shifters.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The yoke divided Tesla fans, as many felt it wasn't practical for one-handed use and that it was awkward when driving at slow speeds. It was also deemed <a href="https://twitter.com/FredericLambert/status/1404861666106433540">potentially unsafe</a> by some owners in case you needed to do quick maneuvers like a skid recovery.</p><div id="84b2541ceda04a6f9ad022fc13f3f238"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Yet another round wheel is boring &amp; blocks the screen. FSD in panoramic mode looks way better with a yoke.</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1435917094751768582?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 9, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>When the yoke came along, Tesla also replaced all the stalks with force touch buttons, another thing some drivers weren't crazy about. As mentioned though, the new wheel option doesn't have any stalks or shifters either, and the design appears to be based on the yoke in terms of spoke positioning, buttons, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>When asked in a tweet in 2021 if Tesla would offer a round steering wheel as an option to the yoke, he replied simply &quot;No.&quot; He went on to explain that &quot;yet another round wheel is boring &amp; blocks the screen. FSD in panoramic mode looks way better with a yoke.&quot; Apparently, there were enough potential buyers who felt otherwise.</p>

## Delta will offer free WiFi on domestic flights starting February 1st

<p>Delta is <a href="https://news.delta.com/ces2023/delta-introduces-fast-free-onboard-wi-fi">introducing</a> free WiFi on around 80 percent of its domestic US flights starting on February 1st, 2023, confirming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/delta-free-wifi-2023-224010550.html">rumors</a> from late last year. The service, available through a T-Mobile sponsorship, will come to 700 planes by the end of the year and on regional and international aircraft by the end of 2024. &quot;It's going to be free. It's going to be fast. And it's going to be available to everyone,&quot; said Delta CEO Ed Bastian <a href="https://news.delta.com/media/videopiksel/50986">at CES 2023</a>.</p><p>Travelers will need to use their Delta SkyMiles information to log in for access, but getting an account is free.  The company announced last year that it would be upgrading more planes using <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-27-viasat-fastest-satellite-internet-us-via-sat-2.html">Viasat</a> as a provider. It has been charging a $5 flat fee for WiFi to date.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apart from any profit motive, airlines have been slow to introduce free WiFi over concerns that the systems wouldn't be fast enough to accommodate hundreds of people at once. Delta has been working on the system since 2018, with the eventual goal to offer free WiFi.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;We didn’t just want free Wi-Fi to offer base-level service – we wanted it to be transformative for the entire onboard experience,&quot; he said. &quot;It is imperative all customers onboard can enjoy their favorite content just as they would at home, and we’ve put this system through meticulous tests to make that possible.&quot;</p><p>Jetblue also offers free WiFi via corporate sponsorship, but Southwest, United, American and other airlines charge fees, usually in the $8 to $10 range. American has recently been trialing free WiFi for certain customers.&nbsp;</p><p>Delta also announced that it will unveil new in-flight entertainment systems starting this summer, with user preferences traveling from &quot;flight to flight... even where you left off on a movie,&quot; according to the press release.&nbsp;</p>

## L’Oréal's Hapta is an assistive grip that keeps lipstick level while it's being applied

<p>In years past, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/loreal/">L’Oréal</a> has shown up at CES with gadgets that deliver personalized beauty products to consumers. From the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-08-loreals-handheld-skincare-doles-out-custom-formula-at-each-pre.html">Perso custom skincare dispenser</a> to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ysl-rouge-sur-mesure-at-home-lipstick-maker-powered-by-perso-loreal-140042801.html">YSL at-home lipstick maker</a>, the company's tech lab has brought interesting gadgets to the show that have tangential inclusive benefits. But this year at CES 2023, it's introducing an accessibility-minded device that can help those with limited hand or arm mobility apply lipstick. The system is called Hapta, and based on a quick demo I tried here in Vegas, is surprisingly refined.</p><p>It's worth noting right off the bat that some assembly is required to use the system. There are three general parts to Hapta: the lipstick in a custom case, the gimbal on a mount and a grip. To set the device up, you'd need to have all three components set up on a stand. In this initial setup, the lipstick is in a custom holder that has a spring-loaded release. This makes it possible for someone to remove from the case with one hand. In theory, that is. In reality, at least on the version I saw at CES, the release is still a little too strong, and the lipstick shot straight out of the case and almost onto the floor.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For now, if L’Oréal doesn't refine the system, you'll have to find a way to place a finger or obstruction behind the lipstick before pressing the button. Once you remove the lipstick, you have to place it in the ring attached to the gimbal, which didn't take much effort. Then, you'll have to pick up the grip, line up a symbol on its edge with a corresponding button on the gimbal mount, and slide the handle in. In about a second, the device chimes to indicate that the attachment is secure, and you can pick up the entire thing with one hand and bring it up to your lip.&nbsp;</p><div id="1d2926dcb1754d3b9d0f41deb5323212"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>But first! As of the iteration I saw at the demo, you'll still need to use two hands to twist the lipstick so that enough is peeking out for the application. L’Oréal told me after watching me struggle to make this happen with one hand that it would consider looking into ways to simplify this process.&nbsp;</p><p>Once the lipstick is ready, you can put it up to your mouth and pause for a second to sort of calibrate the Hapta. It'll understand what position is upright and maintain that by compensating against any motion while you move the grip around.</p><p>To be clear, for hygiene reasons, I did not apply this lipstick on my mouth, and because of that I don't know how well the application process performs. But from my using it to hover over my lips as I moved my elbow and wrist, the gimbal felt sturdy enough to withstand some pressure, and the motors were very responsive. In general, the Hapta was quick to react to my motion and keep the lipstick level, which is important if you're trying to draw a precise line near your cupid's bow, for instance. For those who might not have the finger strength or dexterity to hold up something as small as a tube of lipstick, I can see Hapta being useful.</p><figure><img alt="The Loreal Hapta system comprising a lipstick holder, a gimbal and a grip, all laid out in a dock." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/e52fda10-8d97-11ed-bdfd-1056b3991225" style="height: 1080; width: 1920;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Joel Chokkattu / Engadget</div></figure><p>The Hapta will be available for between $149 and $199 starting in December, and L’Oréal said it will also be making a version that's designed for people with tremors in their hands. In spite of the few quirks I saw at the demo, I was mostly impressed by what the company has made so far. This is by no means just a prototype. Everything felt polished, which makes sense as L’Oréal worked with utensil maker Verily that made utensils that level themselves for people with limited hand and arm movements.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, L’Oréal said in a press release that Hapta will launch with Lancôme lipsticks in 2023, but that it will be &quot;followed by additional makeup applications in the future.&quot; It's not only nice to see people with disabilities being included in beauty tech, but it's also encouraging that a brand as big as L’Oréal is actively working on tools to enable independence in makeup application for everyone.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-02-peugeot-e-legend-concept-ev.html">Peugeot</a> has presented its vision for the future of electric cars at CES 2023, where it previewed its latest concept sedan called the &quot;Inception.&quot; The car is all angles and sharp lines with panoramic glass windows that go all around its middle, paired with a glass roof. Peugeot says its body shade is made of very fine metal pigments, while the lights on the front bumper incorporate the brand's three emblematic claws.</p><p>Inception — named after the Latin word &quot;Inceptio,&quot; which means the beginning — was built on one of Stellantis' four future BEV-by-design platforms, specifically the one for low sedans. It uses an 800-volt, 100kWh battery technology that gives it the capability to travel 800 km or 497 miles on a single charge and can suck enough juice to travel 150 km (93 miles) within five minutes of being plugged in. The four-wheel drive vehicle can also be recharged by induction, eliminating the need for cables. When it comes to power, Inception's two electric motors can generate 680 horsepower combined and give it the ability to accelerate from 0 to 100kmh in less than 3 seconds.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The concept also marks the debut of the brand's next-gen cockpit. It replaces the classic steering wheel with a rectangular one called the &quot;Hypersquare,&quot; which comes with a tablet-type screen at the center that displays information. There's a circular recess at each corner of the screen that users can program to control certain aspects of their vehicle, so they can easily use their thumbs to access them without having to take their hands off the wheel.&nbsp;</p><p>Peugeot says the Inception will inspire its future electric vehicles, including its most compact models. The first cars based on the design will arrive as soon as 2025.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="Peugeot" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/0e867610-8d95-11ed-a5dd-2fae9abc8800" style="height: 1017; width: 1600;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><figure><img alt="Peugeot" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/343e3910-8d95-11ed-babf-be999a76c781" style="height: 1007; width: 1600;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p></p>

## At CES 2023, Google showed up as an automotive company

<p>In recent years, Google has used CES as a platform to showcase its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-ces-2022-news-fast-pair-nearby-share-windows-chrome-cast-180055389.html">vision of &quot;Better Together&quot;</a> — the idea that all devices should play nice with each other. Typically, that means it makes announcements around features like Fast Pair and expansion of Cast compatibility to more third-party products. At CES 2023, the company shared that it's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-speaker-handoff-android-13-spotify-180012769.html">working with Spotify to integrate</a> the Connect streaming tool into the Android UI. It also teased a preview of an audio handoff feature that would suggest different devices to move your music onto depending on your habits and where you are.&nbsp;</p><p>But CES is a big car show, and Google also has products for automobiles. Today, it also told us that its higher-resolution maps will debut on the Polestar 3 and, for the first time since its announcement at I/O 2022, showed off the latest Android Auto interface to the public.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There were two vehicles at the Google booth at the Las Vegas Convention Center's trailer lot — a BMW i7 with the new Android Auto experience and a Volvo EX90 with Google built in. This was our first look at the Volvo itself, and we'll be putting up a separate hands-on about our experience with that in a bit. Our focus for this story (and video) is the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-auto-redesign-whatsapp-calling-180034034.html">new Android Auto</a>.</p><div id="f05960f266b3490d817c70339cb6f9a3"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>Like we learned at I/O, the updated interface will adapt to bigger screen sizes and feature a split screen layout. Google's removed the status bar, placing indicator icons in a small square to the top left, and added a row of shortcut keys below that. When we were in the car, the left panel housed the Spotify app, and with a swipe from the right side, we pulled in a list of suggested playlists.&nbsp;</p><p>This left window also serves as a container for alerts that you don't have time to deal with during your drive. For example, if a notification comes in, you can swipe right on it to send it to the dock, and it'll wait there until you're ready to deal with it.</p><p>For more of our experience with the revamped Android Auto in the BMW i7, check out the video above! And make sure to stay tuned this week for a ton of news coming out of CES 2023.&nbsp;</p>
