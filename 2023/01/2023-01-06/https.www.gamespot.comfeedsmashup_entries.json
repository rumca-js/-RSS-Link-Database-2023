The Fallout series takes the bright image we had of the future in the 1940s and '50s and imagines that it all came true--and then went horribly wrong. We had nuclear-powered cars, home assistant robots, and every convenience you could've ever imagined. Everything was clean and slickly designed.</p><p>And then, in 2077, nuclear war blew it all to hell. That's where the players come in. Having lived in underground bunkers called Vaults, built by a company called Vault-Tec, these self-sustaining shelters became homes for countless potential survivors and were meant to work until the world was safe to inhabit again. Many of the vaults, however, were also used as experiments on their inhabitants, and others simply malfunctioned. Throughout the game series, players have left their vaults as early as the year 2102 and as late as 2287, emerging into the post-apocalyptic wasteland in pursuit of knowledge, supplies, and survival.</p><div><blockquote align=\"center\" class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Congratulations and Happy 25th Birthday!

This year, that initial MCU offering is Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. And maybe, just maybe, this film will finally give the MCU a little bit of focus after three years of movies and TV shows have struggled to connect to one another.. While it's doubtful Disney has felt any kind of pain in the wallet over the fan response to the post-Endgame MCU yet, the people have gotten restless with this supposed shared universe being dominated by unrelated stories.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">And then when they have tried some of that connective tissue lately, it's gone poorly. Take Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, an astonishing film from a great filmmaker that nearly grinds to a halt whenever Martin Freeman or Julia Louis-Dreyfuss is on screen as part of the greater MCU story.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">But Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania could change this state of affairs for the MCU by dealing with some major dangling threads and finally giving the MCU the new central plot thread it's been lacking since Endgame.

With Mandalorian star Pedro Pascal as Joel and Game of Thrones standout Bella Ramsey as Ellie, this post-apocalyptic zombie drama has all the makings of a hopefully instant classic--something that is quite rare for video games brought to life as movies or TV shows. There's no doubt, though, that fans are going to be worried about changes being made to the story. And yes, changes are made--but with good reason--over the course of the first season, which covers the first game.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Speaking to GameSpot, TV Guide, and Metacritic, The Last of Us game writer and co-director Neil Druckmann--who is also a writer and executive producer on the show--was quick to explain. \"There's things that work in the game that would just not work in the show,\" he said. \"The game is about--sometimes--immersion and these continuous sequences through continuous space and time to get you to feel like you're that character. And the show, if we were to shoot it exactly like that, it would just get boring, the violence would get rote in a way that it doesn't in the game because there\u2019s certain mechanics and stuff that really affect you.\"</p><p dir=\"ltr\">It's hard to argue with Druckmann's reasoning here. While the games are a fascinating and creepy dive into Joel and Ellie's experiences in a zombie-filled wasteland, a camera simply following them around while they kill off clickers and anyone that gets in their way can only be entertaining for so long when you're not personally controlling their actions. What about the story changes, though? For showrunner Craig Mazin (Chernobyl), that was something they were constantly working hard to figure out.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-co-director-had-one-rule-for-changing-game-canon-on-hbo-tv-show/1100-6510391/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ffxiv-patch-6-3-notes-new-quests-alliance-raid-and-group-pose-changes/1100-6510390/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "FFXIV Patch 6.3 Notes: New Quests, Alliance Raid, And Group Pose Changes", "date_published": "2023-01-06 19:52:00+00:00", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">FFXIV Patch 6.3, Gods Revel, Lands Tremble, is releasing on January 10.

Leavers effectively punish all six players in a Solo Shuffle match, as no rating can be earned or lost by others in the match once someone quits. The issue is compounded with the long queue times most players have when trying to find a match. Spending 30 minutes in matchmaking to get into a match only for it to be completely thrown out the window when someone quits can be infuriating, to put it mildly.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-wow-dragonflight-best-new-features-is-plagued-with-quitters-but-changes-are-coming-soon/1100-6510385/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-s-get-another-price-hike-in-india/1100-6510388/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Xbox Series S Get Another Price Hike In India", "date_published": "2023-01-06 18:45:00+00:00", "description": "<p>The Xbox Series S will receive its second price hike in India in just six months, and third overall, just days ahead of preorders re-opening.</p><p>Media analyst Rishi Alwani posted on Twitter that Xbox Series S will get a price hike to Rs.39,990, approximately $485.
