Am I the only one worried by this?<p>For all the talk about \"AI ethics\" there is it seems strinking to me that the current state of the art model will opt for providing a convincing argument for why it's wrong answer is correct, rather than say that the answer it provides might be innacurate. (Funnily enough this is what humans tend to do aswell.)\nBeing that these models often tend to be trained on data found on the internet, could this be a sign of the bias we tend to have when writing on social platforms and the internet in general? (As in justifying our answers instead of trying to get to the correct one)<p>So the questions are:\n1. What are the consequences of this in the development of LLMs and in their application to various fields?<p>2. How would one implement this capability of recognizing where the model might be innacurate?<p>3. Is 2. really that much more complicated than what is currently being done? If not, then why hasn't it been done yet?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34373911\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34373911</a></p>\n<p>Points: 8</p>\n<p># Comments: 7</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.npr.org/2023/01/13/1148985075/time-tracking-software-canadian-woman-reach-cpa-court", "title": "Woman ordered to repay $2k after her employer used software to track her time", "date_published": "2023-01-13 20:52:35+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/01/13/1148985075/time-tracking-software-canadian-woman-reach-cpa-court\">https://www.npr.org/2023/01/13/1148985075/time-tracking-software-canadian-woman-reach-cpa-court</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34373725\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34373725</a></p>\n<p>Points: 37</p>\n<p># Comments: 21</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://blog.information-superhighway.net/what-the-hell-is-forth", "title": "What the hell is Forth?

service for PC", "date_published": "2023-01-13 15:58:52+00:00", "description": "<p>Hey everyone, I\u2019m Pedro, and together with my friend Paulo I co-founded MagnaPlay (<a href=\"https://magnaplay.tech\">https://magnaplay.tech</a>). Basically, we\u2019re a \u201cSpotify\u201d, but for games made by independent creators on PC.<p>Paulo and I have been indie gamers for the past decade. Both of us have insanely long back catalogs of games we\u2019ve always wanted to try, but couldn\u2019t. When we were stuck at home during covid, we were frustrated and decided to set out to solve this problem. Naturally, this decision was made during a game of Call of Duty: Warzone.<p>For consumers, MagnaPlay eliminates the paywall when it comes to buying a new game. Today, the indie market is incredibly saturated and prices are increasing. A subscription service, like Spotify, can make indie gaming more affordable and allow players to try out more content.<p>For developers, we solve the problem of lower consumer lifetime values for indie games.  Most indie games sell for around $10 and lose 50% of that to tax and store commissions, so the average player only nets them around $5 LTV. By introducing a revenue model which focuses on the distribution of player subscriptions, we\u2019re able to pay developers a recurring revenue stream, as long as people are playing their game. This way, indie games can achieve profitability with a smaller player base, which is crucial as these developers tend to have incredibly small marketing budgets.<p>MagnaPlay subscriptions cost $8/month. We divide that up and distribute it to developers based on a series of data such as time played, play sessions and number of downloads. We designed this with the idea of helping indies achieve profitability with a smaller player base, crucial when competition is ever-increasing.<p>This isn\u2019t a new idea, but we offer a few twists. Namely: a) we only work with indie games, which makes the unit economics work; b) we don\u2019t do streaming\u2014the business model doesn\u2019t really work and it\u2019s not as cool as it sounds; and c) we\u2019re trying out all our funky gamer ideas: letting players vote for titles, let players review games on a review feed and even letting players choose who gets part of their subscription!<p>By far our biggest difficulty is overcoming the chicken-and-egg problem of platform businesses: we need games to get users, and we need users to get games. We have a few high quality games already, but not enough yet to draw major interest. Things have been especially hard on the supply side, because most of the time we\u2019re competing with massive companies such as Microsoft, which really bankroll their service \u201cGame Pass\u201d. We\u2019re going to have to be clever and determined to overcome this problem and it may need some real hacking\u2026accepting any suggestions!<p>In the meantime, if you think MagnaPlay is a good idea and would like it to exist in your world, like we do, we\u2019d love you to consider taking a leap of faith with us and getting in early. We promise to listen closely to your opinions about what games to add and how to build this out going forward!<p>The other perennial question, of course, is piracy. Since we don\u2019t do streaming, all games are installed on your computer, but since we\u2019re a subscription service, we have to validate your subscription\u2014and however we do that, it has to be effortless for the indie developers to integrate with.<p>For this, we ended up building our own DRM program. It consists of a C++ wrapper that encrypts and compresses games\u2019 raw binary, as well as a program which injects assembly code into the game\u2019s .EXE files which validates the parent process of the program upon running. The beauty of it is: developers don\u2019t need to change any of their source code! (An interesting tradeoff is that although this reduces game file size by around 26%, it unfortunately increases memory usage by around 9%.) Most players understandably dislike DRMs, and of course there\u2019s no perfect solution against piracy, but we\u2019re hopeful that this approach will be non-intrusive enough for both players and devs to solve this core business problem.<p>We are super happy to see customers trying out games they normally wouldn\u2019t! One example was Jared, who runs an indie podcast (Indie Game International on Spotify!): he got word of MagnaPlay and later told us how he gave this little indie game called Existensis a try and he absolutely loved it, played it to completion, and then ended up interviewing the developer on his podcast! So far, this was definitely the coolest thing we\u2019ve seen happen on/due to MagnaPlay.<p>We\u2019re happy to launch MagnaPlay on Hacker News and are eager to hear your feedback on our value prop, suggestions on dealing with chicken and egg, and on our product, which is available now for a free trial and then $8/month on <a href=\"https://magnaplay.tech\">https://magnaplay.tech</a>. We look forward to your comments!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34369562\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34369562</a></p>\n<p>Points: 10</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://eylenburg.github.io/browser_engines.htm", "title": "History of Web Browser Engines from 1990 until today", "date_published": "2023-01-13 15:58:49+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://eylenburg.github.io/browser_engines.htm\">https://eylenburg.github.io/browser_engines.htm</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34369560\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34369560</a></p>\n<p>Points: 18</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://biblioracle.substack.com/p/chatgpt-cant-kill-anything-worth", "title": "ChatGPT Can't Kill Anything Worth Preserving", "date_published": "2023-01-13 15:32:11+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://biblioracle.substack.com/p/chatgpt-cant-kill-anything-worth\">https://biblioracle.substack.com/p/chatgpt-cant-kill-anything-worth</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34369110\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34369110</a></p>\n<p>Points: 34</p>\n<p># Comments: 14</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://caseysoftware.com/blog/working-for-a-dating-website", "title": "Working for a Dating Website (2015)", "date_published": "2023-01-13 14:59:42+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://caseysoftware.com/blog/working-for-a-dating-website\">https://caseysoftware.com/blog/working-for-a-dating-website</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34368601\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34368601</a></p>\n<p>Points: 42</p>\n<p># Comments: 35</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/01/13/examples-of-floating-point-problems/", "title": "Examples of Floating Point Problems", "date_published": "2023-01-13 14:59:21+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/01/13/examples-of-floating-point-problems/\">https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/01/13/examples-of-floating-point-problems/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34368597\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34368597</a></p>\n<p>Points: 12</p>\n<p># Comments: 4</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34368237", "title": "Ask HN: We found a cracked version of our software on the web, now what?", "date_published": "2023-01-13 14:35:07+00:00", "description": "<p>Hi HN, I work for a small company and we've recently come across a version of our software that's been cracked.<p>Specifically, the crack modifies some of our binaries to circumvent the activation process and allows bogus registration keys. Pretty standard stuff AFAIK. Thankfully, our digital signatures are lost in the process, so that's reassuring.<p>We haven't done the most thorough search of how widespread the issue is, but we've estimated that it's about 1 user per day since the early half of 2022. A license costs a few thousand dollars, but we do regional pricing and bulk licenses for larger firms. We also provide free licenses to academics (with proof).<p>For context, we are a <15 person company where we all wear multiple hats and would like to continue providing great service, training and introducing features. It's clear to us why someone would crack our software, especially in lower income countries.<p>I'm not entirely sure what other information would be helpful to provide, but I was wondering if anyone has run into this into the past, and how it was mitigated. While we'll always have some piracy, we'd like to keep it to a minimum.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a
