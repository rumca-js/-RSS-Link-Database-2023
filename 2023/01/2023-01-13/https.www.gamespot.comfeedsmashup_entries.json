21:14:00+00:00", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">These days, video game announcements and news are generally only a few clicks away, but it wasn't always so easy. The way players first discovered a game was often via commercials--yes, the kind on actual TV--and they needed to get your attention in only about 30 seconds. Not all of them succeeded, but there have been some absolutely fantastic video game commercials over the years, including some for less-than-fantastic games. GameSpot has rounded up our picks for the best video game commercials and advertisements of all time, ranging from the early days of the Atari 2600 to a game that just came out recently.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Halo 3: \"Believe\"</h2><div>          </div><p dir=\"ltr\">One of the most effective video game commercials ever didn't feature any gameplay or pre-rendered cinematics. In fact, it barely even featured any movement. Dubbed \"Believe,\" this commercial for Halo 3 consists of panning shots across a miniatures display, with terrified UNSC marines awaiting their fate as an enormous swarm of Covenant surrounds them. On top of a hill, their leader holds the Master Chief, thinking the Spartan has been defeated--but the plasma grenade in the Master Chief's hand lets us know that this battle is just getting started.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Gears of War: \"Mad World\"</h2><div>          </div><p dir=\"ltr\">Before Halo 3 released on Xbox 360, Microsoft had another stunning shooter franchise to keep players happy, and its trailer has stuck with us for more than 16 years. Gears of War's Mad World trailer paints a bleak picture of Earth, with much of the world destroyed as the Locust horde and humanity continue their devastating war. The song--a cover that first appeared in Donnie Darko--does suggest the game will be a little bit more\u2026 <em>reserved </em>than it ended up being, but chopping an enemy in half with a chainsaw gun still sends us back to this trailer.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-best-video-game-commercials-of-all-time/1100-6510490/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-xiv-6-3-lapis-manalis-dungeon-guide/1100-6510581/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Final Fantasy XIV 6.3 Lapis Manalis Dungeon Guide", "date_published": "2023-01-13 20:04:00+00:00", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online-a-realm-reborn/\">Final Fantasy XIV</a> 6.3 update added a new level 90 dungeon called <strong>Lapis Manalis</strong>.

Variable Refresh Rate-supported TVs or monitors will also have graphical modes available to take advantage of this technology.</p><p>For last-gen versions of the game, details haven't been revealed just yet as <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacys-ps4-xbox-one-and-switch-versions-get-2023-release-dates/1100-6509989/\">Hogwarts Legacy will only be available on Xbox One and PS4</a> from April 4 and on Switch from July 25. While every game is different with its graphical design, mid-gen consoles such as PS4 Pro and Xbox One X are usually capable of running these games at 4K 30fps with few concessions, while the base PS4 and Xbox One consoles adopt a dynamic resolution setup that maxes out at 1080p.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-graphics-modes-revealed/1100-6510549/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-does-apples-ceo-make/1100-6510548/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "How Much Does Apple's CEO Make?", "date_published": "2023-01-13 13:07:00+00:00", "description": "<p>Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, is taking a pay cut this year that he has asked for, cutting his total pay from the past year significantly.

Joining the adorable ranks of Starhorse, Fallen grub babies, and the phantom cat on the moon, Archangel--or Archie for short--is a robot dog that made its debut a few weeks ago in Season of the Seraph. How Bungie designed this new companion is both heartwarming <em>and </em>horrifying, as the developer detailed in its <a href=\"https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/twab_01_12_2023\">weekly blog post</a>.</p><figure style=\"width: 1660px;\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4086251-archie.png\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4086251-archie.png\" /></a></figure><p>\"Each Season we spend a bit of time brainstorming fun little Easter eggs, and for this season, everyone wanted to build a robot dog. But it wasn't that easy,\" Bungie explained. \"After the team came up with the idea, the first question was, 'Can I pet it?' And we knew the answer had better be, 'Yes!' So, we quickly performed this interesting test to confirm that 'petting the dog' was indeed possible.\"</p><p>That test involved numbers, a petting animation, and a neon pink squatting humanoid stand-in for Archie that Bungie could test its petting actions on. In a universe filled with paracausal entities, death-worshipping alien invaders, and wish-granting dragons, this is probably one of the strangest things that Bungie has shown since <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xurs-ship-in-destiny-2-is-just-a-big-rock-and-now-you-can-get-it/1100-6499054/\">Xur began offering an interstellar transport rock</a> as a prize in Dares of Eternity.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-has-an-adorable-robot-dog-with-a-nightmare-fuel-origin-story/1100-6510545/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-next-iron-banner-event-wont-be-a-huge-grind/1100-6510544/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Destiny 2's Next Iron Banner Event Won't Be A Huge Grind", "date_published": "2023-01-13 13:03:00+00:00", "description": "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-season-of-the-seraphs-iron-banner-introduces-new-fortress-mode/1100-6510252/\">return of Iron Banner</a> in Destiny 2 earlier this month was a fresh chance to earn legacy armor, try out a new mode, and acquire a shader that could give your gear a chainmail design, but the event wasn't without controversy. With fans criticizing the PvP mode for being too much of a grind, Bungie has made a few updates to the next Iron Banner that'll be coming sooner than expected.</p><p>Addressing the fan feedback about the tiresome grind for Iron Banner armor and cosmetics, Bungie says that it plans to increase the amount of Iron Banner Rank you earn at the end of matches, double up on the reputation multipliers that you'll get from wearing Iron Banner gear, and \"significantly increase\" the multiplier you get for wearing an Iron Banner emblem. The only part of this reputation grind that will get nerfed is the multiplier for completing challenges, as that will be halved when Iron Banner returns on January 31.</p><p>\"We expect this to decrease the number of games needed to earn a Rank reset by around 40% and make it more worthwhile to play earlier in the week,\" Bungie said in its <a href=\"https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/twab_01_12_2023\">weekly blog post</a>.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-next-iron-banner-event-wont-be-a-huge-grind/1100-6510544/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/todays-wordle-answer-573-january-13-2023/1100-6510518/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Today's Wordle Answer (#573) - January 13, 2023", "date_published": "2023-01-13 08:00:00+00:00", "description": "<p>It\u2019s Friday, and players should end the week right by getting the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/wordle/\">Wordle</a> correct.
