<p>Several Sheriff's Departments in Illinois have already said they won't be enforcing the new law. Greene County Sheriff Robert McMillen wrote in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid0AYzhooZnDbKWE4J43D1dAXHmMm8Zh6giiLxqDQsfpX3u9gJJxRKCrThVbXADVwrVl&amp;id=100064564724339" target="_blank">letter</a> to his citizens, "As the custodian of the jail and as your chief law enforcement official, neither myself, nor my deputies, nor my office will be conducting or participating in any investigations or arrests [...] concerning lawful gun owners failing to register their weapons with the state; or any other of the unconstitutional provisions contained in HB 5471." </p><p>Governor Pritzker proceeded to threaten the employment of any law enforcement officers who refuse to follow his tyrannical agenda, saying in a press conference, "they will in fact do their job or they won’t be in their job." </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>John Boch, the Executive Director of the nonprofit organization "Guns Save Life," said several gun rights organizations plan to file challenges in federal court as early as next week. Devore Law Office also plans to bring a lawsuit against Governor Pritzker in state court, according to their <a href="https://devorelawoffices.com/" target="_blank">website</a>. </p><p>There's reason to be optimistic about the litigation of this law, in light of the Supreme Court's decision on New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen. That ruling set a precedent for determining whether a gun law is constitutional: the judges must rely on the text of the Second Amendment and the history of gun laws rather than the public safety purpose of the law. This decision also overturned <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/times-square-gun-free-zone" target="_blank">New York's</a> restrictions on concealed carry permits.  </p><p><p>

<p> In an email to a DeSantis official, the Coast Guard wrote, "I wanted to formally request the TWIN ENGINE FWC and FLARNG aircraft be authorized to patrol out to 12NM from the shoreline of Florida [...] In my opinion, there should be no objections to this as the state will likely not prosecute migrant vessels."</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>The federal government seems a wee bit butt-hurt that DeSantis keeps highlighting their already blatant incompetence, which is no easy feat. This saga is reminiscent of the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jonathan-turley-desantis-immigrant-lawsuit" target="_blank">Martha's Vineyard</a> scandal, when the White House accused DeSantis of pulling political stunts and endangering the lives of poor illegal immigrants by sending them to a luxury vacation destination. </p><p>To add flame to the fire, the administration has not had a great week for immigration stories. Biden faced criticism earlier in the week when he visited the border for the first time as President. It only took him...two years, give or take a few days! </p><p>On top of that, the migrant encampments in El Paso were cleaned up ahead of Biden's visit.

<p>Must just be another one of those crazy conspiracy theories. As our fearless Border Czar Kamala Harris says, the border is most definitely, 100%, actually for real closed. For realzies. </p><p><p>

</p><p>The new narrative is it's unfounded that conservatives wouldn't take the Biden Adminstration at their word. Also unfounded is the belief that if there is someone talking about this in the administration, there are enough people who think it's a good idea.

And that means Gavin Newsom will one-up her by banning gas. But the White House says Joe Biden isn't going to, so we should believe him. And DEFINITELY don't think <strong></strong>Democrats would sneak a gas stove regulation into larger, unrelated bills like it's a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/irs-600-side-job" target="_self">$600 Venmo tax</a>.</p><p>Washinton Post isn't even bothering to be slick about it.

But I'm sure we could brainstorm together.</p><p>I also think a re-education attempt against Jordan Peterson would end one of two ways. One is with the re-educators sitting in the fetal position of a shower, rocking back and forth and sobbing.

## LOL: Big-Brained AOC attempts to defend having a gas stove after she supported banning them

She first blamed her rental unit for installing the lethal appliance and then claimed: "science evolves." </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Earlier this week, after a lifetime of never publicly stating an opinion on gas stoves, AOC became an overnight gas stove hater. When news broke of the Biden admin's proposed ban on the sinister cookware, AOC tweeted: "Did you know that ongoing exposure to NO2 from gas stoves is linked to reduced cognitive performance."</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Republicans were quick to point out that AOC uses a gas stove. Which to be honest is a more convincing piece of evidence tying them to cognitive impairment than any scientific study I've seen. Maybe there's something to this. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>AOC is yet again missing the point that Republicans are merely meming on her and actually don't care at all whether she has a gas stove or not. It's quite hilarious to see her constantly display her hypocrisy without a single shred of self-awareness. Like when she attended the $30k-per -ticket <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/aoc-tax-rich-dress-irony" target="_blank">MET gala</a> in a "Tax the Rich dress." Or when she launched $58 "Tax the Rich" merch. Or that time she posed for a Vanity Fair photoshoot in $14,000 outfits. She just can't understand why she keeps getting mocked, poor little pea-brain. <span></span></p><p>At least in this case, AOC's in good company. Jill Biden also uses a gas stove, according to this 2020 tweet:</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cHey @Antoni, what are you cooking tonight?\u201d</div> — Dr. Jill Biden (@Dr. Jill Biden)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/DrBiden/status/1301301376652382220">1599089399</a>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, the issue here isn't the gas stove. I really don't care about anyone's cookware of choice, let alone what Jill Biden uses to spoon-feed Joe Biden while he sundowns. The problem is our ruling class's desire to ban it for us plebeians while they enjoy their nice gas-powered stovetops. Stove bans for thee, but not for me! </p><p><p>

<p>It always boggles my mind when leftists claim pro-lifers don't care about the child after it's born, then proceed to firebomb the crisis pregnancy centers that...care about the child after it's born. In fact, over 200 House Democrats just voted against condemning the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nashville-hope-clinic" target="_blank">attacks on crisis pregnancy centers</a> and churches that have occurred since the leaked Dobbs decision. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Lefties also tend to claim pro-lifers aren't actually pro-life since many support the death penalty and gun rights as well. Because nothing screams "hatred of innocent life" like executing the most abhorrent criminals and allowing civilians to defend themselves against tyranny. <br /></p><p>Meanwhile, over 200 Democrats in the House of Representatives just voted against the "Born Alive Infants Protection Act." With so many Democrats opposing, this must be more of that right-wing propaganda, right? Surely, that many Democrats can't be <em>that</em> evil?</p><p>Oh no. They are. </p><p>The bill would require doctors to provide life-saving care for babies who survive attempted abortions. Nancy Pelosi called the bill an "extreme anti-choice agenda." </p><p>Jerry Nadler claimed, "The problem with this bill is that it endangers some infants [born alive] by stating that that infant must immediately be brought to the hospital." </p><p>That math doesn't really check out, since the endangerment of infants comes during the abortion intended to kill them. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>I don't think she made the intended point with that statement. Luckily, the bill passed, despite all these genius Democrats who voted against it. It will likely not make it through the Senate, unfortunately, but at least Republicans were able to express their desire to refrain from killing babies. </p><p><p>

## Byron Donalds' wife lets liberals attacking her for the color of her skin know where they can stick their hate

As Rep. Byron Donalds stepped out into the spotlight last week, I'm sure he was as <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tim-scott-joy-behar" target="_blank">unsurprised as Sen. Tim Scott was</a>. But in the case of people like Rep. Cori Bush, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/byron-donalds-reporter-cori" target="_blank">at least she was man enough to attack Byron directly</a>. Other haters went after his wife Erika on Twitter.</p><p>Why? Between Byron and Erika...one has a lot more melanin than the other one.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="84d3c" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32842749&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Erika Donalds shared some of the hate directed her way from people who didn't have the balls to say it to Byron. Also, more importantly, to let the haters know they can all suck it.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Byron and I have been together for 23+ years, and the most racist attacks we experience are always from the left. They can’t accept that a free thinking black man achieves success on his own merits, and they sure as heck can’t stand that he’s married to me! <br />Cry harder, haters. <a href="https://t.co/Xl4vpv3jKT">pic.twitter.com/Xl4vpv3jKT</a><br />— Erika Donalds (@ErikaDonalds) <a href="https://twitter.com/ErikaDonalds/status/1613149434233384966?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 11, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p><br /></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">And…there’s more! ✌🏼 <a href="https://t.co/2jmxDHxUvL">pic.twitter.com/2jmxDHxUvL</a><br />— Erika Donalds (@ErikaDonalds) <a href="https://twitter.com/ErikaDonalds/status/1613190450818732032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 11, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p><em>"Surprise surprise. His wife is...never mind."</em></p><p><em>"Yep, his wife is what he expected."</em></p><p><em>"Byron Donalds has a white, fascist wife. She's the new Ginni Thomas!"</em></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="3fc52" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32842776&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>What's most remarkable? Not that this would be an excuse, but it's not like Rep. Donalds took a controversial stance on a hot-button issue to stir up such emotion. He didn't say all lives matter. He didn't suggest that maybe, just maybe, fifteen weeks is enough time for you to decide you're going to abort your choice. He didn't defy white media members to name a third black person besides Colin Kaepernick and Stacey Abrams.</p><p>Donalds' big crime was when his colleagues needed a name to nominate for Speaker of the House in order to keep the debate open while they negotiated a rules package, the congressman said, "sure, use mine." </p><p>That's all it took for leftists to justify their hatred. They judge you by the color of your skin to blindly support the content of their policies. If you don't, the color of your skin is their first attack.</p><p><p>

## The View goes "ViewAnon" with lunatic theories on why Joe Biden got caught with classified documents

Much like the first person to use "gaslighting" as an intentional pun for <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-tread-gas-stove" target="_blank">GasStoveGate</a>, I tip my hat you.</p><p>Joe Biden is embroiled in a controversy where, it seems every day, more and more classified documents are found at his home or former office. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/doocy-biden-classified-docs" target="_blank">It makes you wonder how he could be so irresponsible</a>. And I get the desire for his supporters to respond in a partisan fashion. Responding in a partisan fashion is how I make my living. There are right ways and there are wrong ways to go about it though. The right way would be to say you don't care about Biden's classified documents. Or, do what cable news does and claim everything Donald Trump does is always worse.</p><p>The shrill harpies on <em>The View</em> went with the wrong way. Imply it's a GOP conspiracy.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"></div><blockquote>"You know what I think? I’ve never seen a luckier person than Donald Trump Just as we're this close to getting him, <strong>somehow</strong> these documents <strong>appear</strong>!"<br /><br />"Does it feel like oppo-research to you? Does it feel like the <strong>Republicans are behind it?"</strong><br /><br />"I saw Goody DeSantis put <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/corvette-biden-doocy" target="_blank">a box of paper in Joe Biden's Corvette</a>."<br /></blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="c1921" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32842550&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>Keep in mind that <em>The View</em> is a part of ABC's <em>NEWS</em> division and not their entertainment division. Has this been an episode of <em>Grey's Anatomy</em> where Merideth got into an argument with a MAGA patient and made these claims, they would sound far-fetched enough. </p><p>If <em>I claimed</em> the Deep State planted papers in Trump's bathroom, I'd get throttled on Facebook and tagged by "independent" "fact" checkers for spreading "misinformation." The broads on <em>The View</em> have the right political opinion though, so ABC News let's its side.</p><p>We credit <em>The View</em> for being the most trusted name in content for low-information leftists. But they should at least try to make sense.</p><p>And if the GOP <em>were</em> to be behind this, I'd like to think we'd be competent enough to leak the information BEFORE the midterm election.</p><p><p>

There is <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/shoplifter-san-francisco-boutique" target="_blank">shoplifting in progressive cities</a>. Where progressive voters elect progressive politicians to enact progressive "justice" policies that have made shoplifting legal-ish. Then there is <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/shoplifter-police-waiting" target="_blank">shoplifting in Real America</a> where laws are enforced and f*ck you.

On a related note, shout out to the Koe Wetzel/Diplo cut finally dropping today.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Trying to steal a guitar from Guitar Center… <a href="https://t.co/iHYhPio6r0">pic.twitter.com/iHYhPio6r0</a><br />— Daily Country Videos (@DailyCountryVid) <a href="https://twitter.com/DailyCountryVid/status/1613728841822011392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 13, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>It's unclear if more and more retail employees are training in the grappling arts to prepare themselves for dealing with unruly customers. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/best-buy-nfl-defense" target="_blank">Or running through two- and three-a-days with staff</a>. But my man here didn't even think about it. All it took was the thug gesturing to the door before instincts kicked in. Choke. Down. Done.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>What we have here is the look of instant regret, and a man reliving all the poor life choices that have led him to being choked out by a guy making $15 an hour in a retail store.</p>
<p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>The Guitar Center employee was nothing if not forgiving. He gave the guitar thief the opportunity to leave of his own volition. His exact words were, "You are leaving this store right f*cking now. We're going to let you up," as the thief legit tapped out.</p><p>He didn't get up. Second warning "get the f*ck up."</p><p>Third strike was getting dragged out of the store in cartoon-like fashion. At this point, it would not surprise me if the man's face was "accidentally" pressed down on the carpet as he was being removed from the premises.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>Worse than not getting the guitar, this man now lives the rest of his life as content. Being chucked out of a store like he was a damaged display case and the dumpster was right outside. This video could only be improved if the thug was el-kabonged with the guitar he was trying to steal.</p><p><p>
