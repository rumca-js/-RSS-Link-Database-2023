Google announced its shutdown plans in September, and started <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-stadia-refunds-explained-170036646.html\">issuing refunds</a> in November.

Depending on what content it offers and how it sets up the mooted channels, YouTube could end up pulling more attention away from those services.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>YouTube confirmed to the <em>Journal </em>that it's running a test in which a small number of users can watch ad-supported channels. \u201cWe\u2019re always looking for new ways to provide viewers a central destination to more easily find, watch and share the content that matters most to them,\u201d a spokeswoman said.</p><p>The service is said to have teamed up with the likes of Lionsgate, A+E Networks and FilmRise for the test. For media companies, such channels offer a way for them to earn revenue from content that might otherwise languish.</p><p>YouTube <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-17-youtube-free-movies.html\">already offers ad-supported movies</a>, but this hub could give users a bigger platter of free films and shows to watch.

That platform has channels dedicated to reruns of certain shows \u2014 such as <em>CSI, Doctor Who, South Park</em> and <em>Frasier </em>\u2014 along with ones for reality series, live news and even sports.</p><p>The mulled move into FAST aligns with YouTube's strategy of expanding into other video formats beyond the content that's traditionally associated with the platform. In November, it broke premium streaming channels out of YouTube TV and into its main app. Showtime, Starz, Paramount+ and AMC+ were among the first <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/youtube-showtime-paramount-primetime-channels-tv-movies-170458712.html\"><ins>Primetime Channels</ins></a>.

It beat Netflix for the third straight month in November with 8.8 percent of viewing time.

The other difference with this new season is the episodes are 30 minutes with commercials, slightly longer than the 10- to 15-minute entries in the previous installment.

Eventual series winner Stoffel Vandorne has to contend with the fact his teammate is the defending champion.

The final installment offers a look at the lead up to the final two rounds in South Korea. A four-way fight for the title, driver changes and a brief discussion of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/formula-e-gen-e-electric-race-car-164542680.html\"><ins>the Gen3 car</ins></a> round out the sixth episode.</p><p>There\u2019s plenty to glean despite the compressed format. Even I learned new things as someone who follows the sport. However, <em>Unplugged </em>really focuses on the top four teams in the championship standings, with the exception of Porsche who looked strong at the outset and the episode about rookies. It would\u2019ve been great to include Envision Racing\u2019s Robin Frijns, who finished level on points in the driver\u2019s standings with Di Grassi and Dennis. I can appreciate that Formula E likely has a limited budget for the show, which is why we only get a half dozen episodes, but it would\u2019ve been nice to get to know the likes of Mahindra and Nissan eDAMS along the way (the latter is covered in S1). And there could\u2019ve been an entire episode dedicated to the Gen3 car, especially when you consider how much more advanced it is (or eventually will be) over the Gen2 racer.</p><p>In the US, Formula E races are broadcast on CBS Sports Network and usually on a tape delay a few hours after the event.

McHenry considers crypto regulation his main legislative priority, and panel chair Hill has led the GOP's investigation of a potential <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/us-federal-reserve-is-looking-closer-at-a-digital-currency-125534039.html\">central bank-backed cryptocurrency</a>.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The move comes as regulators struggle to find common ground on crypto. While agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) agree that digital assets are <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-13-us-regulator-warning-on-digital-assets.html\">subject to existing laws</a>, there have been tussles over just who should step in and when. Senators put forward a bill that would create a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/senate-crypto-regulation-bill-responsible-financial-innovation-act-143136481.html\">clear regulatory framework</a>, but it has been <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/4356/all-info\">stuck</a> in committee.</p><p>There's pressure on the House subcommittee to act. The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-criminal-and-civil-charges-200410951.html\">implosion of crypto giant FTX</a> has underscored the risks of letting the technology go unchecked. Officials are also investigating major industry names like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/celsius-network-freeze-state-securities-board-investigation-231238212.html\">Celsius</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sec-investigating-coinbase-over-unregistered-security-listings-123321443.html\">Coinbase</a> over possible rule violations. Clearer rules would theoretically improve the federal government's responses to violations like these.</p><p>It's uncertain how effective the House panel will be. While there are crypto proponents across both main parties, the Democrats' expanded control of the Senate could prevent bills from becoming law if there are any substantial disagreements. Both sections of Congress have to pass and reconcile legislation before it reaches the President's desk. The very existence of the subcommittee suggests that Congress is taking crypto more seriously, however, and there's a chance it could accelerate bipartisan efforts to oversee digital money and tokens.</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-7-drops-to-499-best-tech-deals-this-week-163827715.html?src=rss", "title": "Google's Pixel 7 is on sale for $499, plus the rest of the week's best tech deals", "date_published": "2023-01-13 16:39:02+00:00", "description": "<p>It's Friday, which means it's time for another roundup of the week's best tech deals.

It's on sale this week for $30, which is only about $7 below its typical street price but still within $2 of its all-time low.</p><p>If you can afford to take a step up or just want something more accommodating to larger hands, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5e0bed65-d2f8-4b34-9b8f-955218c0e37a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Best+Buy&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI1ZTBiZWQ2NS1kMmY4LTRiMzQtOWI4Zi05NTUyMThjMGUzN2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmVzdGJ1eS5jb20vc2l0ZS9yYXplci1iYXNpbGlzay11bHRpbWF0ZS13aXJlbGVzcy1vcHRpY2FsLXdpdGgtaHlwZXJzcGVlZC10ZWNobm9sb2d5LWFuZC1jaGFyZ2luZy1kb2NrLWdhbWluZy1tb3VzZS1ibGFjay82Mzg0OTM3LnA_c2t1SWQ9NjM4NDkzNyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjUyNWRhODQtMjIwZC00YTBkLTk5YTgtMjA0ZDgxZjg0NjU3In0&amp;signature=AQAAAfu01ss5CN_iPaEsWbHe146YdBXCMiJm8h54b7FUtI80&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Frazer-basilisk-ultimate-wireless-optical-with-hyperspeed-technology-and-charging-dock-gaming-mouse-black%2F6384937.p%3FskuId%3D6384937\">Razer's Basilisk Ultimate</a> is also worth a shout at its current deal price of $70, which is about $30 below its usual going rate.

The new products won't be coming anytime soon, however, with a target release date for the more affordable AirPods no earlier than the second half of 2024. With the AirPods lite (or LE, or whatever Apple decides to call them), Apple would likely be trying to claw back some market share from the many cheap wireless buds on the market. The current AirPods 2 sell for $129, while the AirPods 3 cost $169.

As <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2023/01/12/tim-cook-pay-cut-earnings/\"><em>9to5Mac</em></a> notes, 94.9 percent of the shareholders who voted the previous year was in favor of the compensation proposals for executives.&nbsp;</p><p>To decide this year's pay packages, Apple's Compensation Committee took into account the Say on Pay's voting results and Tim Cook's own recommendation &quot;to adjust his compensation in light of feedback received.&quot; For 2023, Cook's target salary is $49 million, down $35 million from his target salary in 2022. His base pay is still $3 million and his annual cash incentive remains unchanged at $6 million, but his equity award value went from $75 million in 2022 to $40 million this year. Further, he was granted an equity award that's 75 percent performance and 25 percent time-based vesting, instead of 50-50 like 2022's.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The truth is that Cook, who vowed to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2015-03-27-tim-cook-charity.html\">donate his fortune to charity</a> a few years ago, will likely earn more than $49 million this year due to stock awards and bonuses. According to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-12/apple-s-cook-to-take-pay-cut-in-2023-that-it-says-he-requested?sref=10lNAhZ9\"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, he earned $99.4 million in 2022, which was $15.4 million more than his target salary for the year. In 2021, his total pay package was $98.7 million. Critics like advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services previously <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-shareholder-iss-urges-vote-against-ceo-cooks-bonus-2022-02-16/\">urged shareholders</a> to vote against Cook's pay package, citing concerns about how big his equity award is and how it's structured. &quot;Half of the award lacks performance criteria,&quot; the firm previously said. This shift in Cook's compensation reflects the changing attitude towards executive pay, and the CEO might be setting an example for his peers. It is, after all, uncommon for an executive his level to recommend that their own pay be cut.&nbsp;</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}], "source": {"url": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Engadget"}}
