She spent her early years at Graceland but, when she turned five, she moved with her mother to Los Angeles; the Presleys divorced in 1973.

My least favourite time of year. Everything just feels that bit more difficult and my anxiety is intensified. More bad news. Another old friend has killed himself, while another is seriously ill. My dreams are increasingly disturbed. Here\u2019s just two from the last few days. In one, I was in the middle of an apocalypse where everyone had been infected with a virus which gave them less than 24 hours to live. People were turning to skeletons in front of my eyes. And the skeletons were turning to dust. In another, I was off to see a performance of a Wagner opera directed by Dominic Raab. I\u2019m not sure which was more of a nightmare. My traditional life hack of counting the days past the winter solstice provides some relief. The reassurance that the days are getting longer even if barely noticeably so. There\u2019s also comfort to be found in the return of familiar TV dramas. Much has been written about Happy Valley, but I\u2019d like to give a shout out to Silent Witness. It\u2019s now into its 26th series and I\u2019ve watched every one. It\u2019s also got more and more reliably absurd. So much so that it\u2019s almost a comedy. Even when it\u2019s over I\u2019ve got little idea of what\u2019s going on. Last week\u2019s made no sense at all. It started with the Italian mafia, moved on to a children\u2019s home and ended with Jack being captured and miraculously released by the head of the police who was also in the mafia. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/01/sunday-with-emilia-fox-rowing-on-the-thames-with-my-daughter-and-the-dogs\">Emilia Fox</a> skates through the two hours with just one expression. Total bewilderment. She\u2019s bewildered when she does an autopsy. She\u2019s bewildered when she is being attacked. And she\u2019s bewildered when she falls in love. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s Emilia acting or whether she can\u2019t follow the scripts either. It\u2019s rumoured this is the last ever series.

Shows get axed all the time in Hollywood, but 1899 seemed pretty cancel-proof. After all, its creators, Jantje Friese and Baran bo Odar, were also behind Dark, the German sci-fi show that helped birth the idea of Netflix as an international hit factory. Produced by Friese and Odar\u2019s Netflix-backed Dark Ways studio, 1899, it was hoped, would be a model for how planet-conquering series would get made: amassing a global cast on a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMynJCgJIQk\">revolutionary virtual production stage</a>, and slotting it into a moreish puzzle-box mystery series.</p><p>Initial signs were good: a number two placing among Netflix\u2019s English language titles in its first three weeks, and talk of a further two series mapped out by its creators. Then, suddenly, the chop came \u2013 both a bizarrely rash decision and a fitting coda. In 2022, it felt like years of rampant speculation, growth and churned-outcontent had come back to bite the industry.
