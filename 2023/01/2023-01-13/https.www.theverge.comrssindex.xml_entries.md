  <p id="mORTuu">The upcoming Netflix show <em>Agent From Above</em> tried to film its star up close with a drone — and Taiwanese actor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kai_Ko">Kai Ko</a> got stitches, and possibly worse, when things went wrong (<a href="https://dronedj.com/2023/01/13/drone-accident-netflix-kai-ko/">via <em>DroneDJ</em></a>).</p>
<p id="XmZsQr">We don’t have many confirmed details on what happened during the December 27th shoot other than that they were filming an action scene close-up when the drone hit him in the face, slashing his cheek.</p>

<p id="L4STIz">Ko’s manager told Taiwanese media that the star suffered “serious disfigurement” and needed up to 30 stitches after the drone exploded. Production companies mm2 and Good Films say “there was no explosion or blades shattering as reported in some articles,” claim it was operating “within standard safety guidelines,” and say that...</p>

<p id="wU086g">The concept has been part of a profitable business model for some of the other companies in the space, as earnings reports from Vizio and Roku show that they make more profit from advertising and commissions on subscriptions than they do from selling hardware.

  <p id="VIRAfN">No one likes price hikes, but Strava’s messy rollout has left many customers wondering what’s happening to their subscription. Here’s what’s actually happening: the company is raising prices for the first time in more than a decade, and the new price everyone pays depends on the region they live in, whether they are a monthly or annual subscriber, and whether they purchased their subscription prior to November 23rd, 2022. (Customers who subscribed after that date aren’t affected.) But Strava didn’t make this easy to understand.</p>
<p id="PvDlsy">As spotted by sports blogger <a href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2023/01/strava-raises-prices-doubling.html"><em>DC Rainmaker</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/">r/Strava</a> Redditors, things got confusing when customers started comparing notes on Strava’s price bump.

  <p id="Q591si"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons (D&amp;D)</em> publisher Wizards of the Coast (WotC) has issued a statement addressing outrage from the tabletop gaming community in regard to the company’s upcoming Open Gaming License update. A <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/DnD_Shorts/status/1613576298114449409">leaked draft</a> of the new license that applied greater restrictions was badly received by fans of the franchise, resulting in a call from some community members to boycott the Hasbro-owned gaming company.</p>

  <p id="IuivQj">Retro Pod played right into TikTok’s love affair with the iPod. From demos of defunct Minis to outfits showcasing Shuffles as hair clips, an app turning your iPhone into an iPod was naturally going to be a hit. When Retro Pod started making the round in late December, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ellyawesometech/video/7183924116997541122?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;q=retro%20pod&amp;t=1673549397766">TikTokers praised</a> the app’s ability to replicate the iPod’s “tactile, bumpy, vibratey feels” that have been lost in the era of music streaming. Videos featuring the app racked up nearly 5 million views, but by the second week of January, viewers started commenting they couldn’t find the app at all. Retro Pod had disappeared from the App Store.</p>

It’s brief, clocking in at just over a minute, but there’s a lot to dig into: both old and young Misty (Christina Ricci and Samantha Hanratty) crying, Natalie (Juliette Lewis) talking about bringing “darkness” back, and a new character played by Elijah Wood questioning some complicated friendships that revolve around kidnapping and death. It doesn’t give much away about what to expect, though, so don’t worry too much about spoilers.</p>

When that happens, the tornado dissipates into a mild windstorm, making it possible to carry on with your conversation. It’s the sort of helpful background feature that Google’s Pixel phones can be so good at delivering. It’s just a shame that most of them won’t get it.</p>

  <p id="AEHQ25">Horror master Junji Ito is bringing his particular blend of scares to Netflix very soon — and you can get a brief taste in a new trailer. The show, which has the somewhat unwieldy title of <em>Junji Ito Maniac: Japanese Tales of the Macabre</em>, adapts 20 different stories from the manga artist, from iconic pieces like <em>Tomie</em> to cult material such as <em>Layers of Terror</em>. Netflix says that all of the included stories have “the shared theme of madness,” which, of course, is pretty standard for Ito.</p>
<p id="XhF1dn">The trailer is a brisk run through the included material, giving you a hint of what to expect (namely, lots of body horror and disturbing creatures) without giving too much away. If nothing else, the show appears to do a very good job of sticking to Ito’s...</p>

Multiple IT admins have <a href="https://twitter.com/martin_schmidli/status/1613848698470924288">detailed the problem</a> on Twitter <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/10ar1vb/multiple_users_reporting_microsoft_apps_have/">and Reddit</a> this morning, and it appears to be related to a recent update to the Microsoft Defender threat detections.</p>
<p id="ncWbju">The problem is affecting businesses and organizations using Microsoft 365 and Defender for protection against malware, viruses, and other threats. In a <a href="https://twitter.com/martin_schmidli/status/1613880207584141314">note to customers</a>, Microsoft says it has received reports that a certain attack surface reduction (ASR) rule is causing the problems. IT admins are currently trying to work around the issue by setting the “Block Win32 API calls from Office macro” rule to audit only.</p>

  <p id="WuugWd">NASA’s planet-hunting telescope, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), has discovered a second Earth-size planet within the habitable zone of a nearby star.</p>
<p id="DW9N80">Named TOI 700 e, the planet is one of four known planets orbiting a cool star approximately 100 light-years away. The system was already known to host one planet, called TOI 700 d, in the habitable zone, but <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03617">recent research</a> that will be published in the <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em> reveals it is joined by another planet inside its orbit. The other two planets in the system, TOI 700 b and TOI 700 c, orbit closer to the star and, as such, are likely to have higher temperatures, putting them outside of the habitable zone.</p>

## Some third-party Twitter apps appear to be broken

  <p id="VDp8FD">Some third-party Twitter clients such as Twitterific and Tweetbot appear to be experiencing an outage, though the cause is currently unclear. Developers haven’t received any communication from the company about whether the issue is caused by a bug or something else, according to <a href="https://mastodon.world/@paul@tapbots.social/109679939131302211">a Mastodon post</a> from Paul Haddad, one of Tweetbot’s creators.</p>
<p id="CbWcNy">There’s been <a href="https://twitter.com/garywhitta/status/1613754842606088194">speculation</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/pattymo/status/1613760370509750275?s=20">Twitter</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/evacide/status/1613759561604923392?s=20">users</a> and <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/01/12/twitter-api-appears-to-be-down-breaking-tweetbot-and-third-party-clients/">some news outlets</a> that this is a move from Twitter to shut down third-party clients altogether. However, the outage may not be universal. Some apps, like Fenix 2 or Albatross, appear to be working for me and <a href="https://twitter.com/BTP1960/status/1613759681465393162?s=20">some others</a>, though I have seen other users report problems with Fenix. The first-party Twitter app is also still functional. </p>
