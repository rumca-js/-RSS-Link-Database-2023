<p>Since arriving on the market around 2010, gel manicures have become a staple in nail salons across the US and many parts of the world, and it’s easy to see why. Compared to traditional nail polish, gel variants are more resilient to damage and smudging, and they retain their shine until you remove the polish from your fingernails. Best of all, if you’re the impatient sort, you don’t need to wait an hour or more for a gel manicure to dry. Those benefits all come courtesy of the way the polish cures. Instead of waiting for a gel polish to dry naturally, you place your hands under a UV light, which activates the chemicals inside the gel, causing it to harden.</p><p>While the dangers of UV light — particularly in tanning settings — are well-known, before this week scientists had not studied how the ultraviolet lights used to cure gel polishes might affect human skin. You might think what we know about tanning beds applies here, but the devices used by nail salons emit a different spectrum of ultraviolet light. A group of researchers from the <a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/uv-emitting-nail-polish-dryers-damage-dna-and-cause-mutations-in-cells"><ins>University of California San Diego</ins></a> decided to study the devices after reading an article about a beauty pageant contestant who was diagnosed with a rare form of skin cancer.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Using different combinations of human and mouse cells, the researchers found a single 20-minute session with an ultraviolet nail polish dryer led to as many as 30 percent of the cells in a petri dish dying. Three consecutive 20-minute sessions saw 65 to 70 percent of the exposed cells dying off. Among the remaining cells, the researchers saw evidence of mitochondrial and DNA damage, in addition to mutations that have been seen in skin cancer patients.</p><p>“Our experimental results and the prior evidence strongly suggest that radiation emitted by UV-nail polish dryers may cause cancers of the hand and that UV-nail polish dryers, similar to tanning beds, may increase the risk of early-onset skin cancer,” the researchers write in a study published in the journal <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c6c965be-a8ea-473d-89f4-9754f2675a60&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nature+Research&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjNmM5NjViZS1hOGVhLTQ3M2QtODlmNC05NzU0ZjI2NzVhNjAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmF0dXJlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9zNDE0NjctMDIzLTM1ODc2LTgiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjRhMGE2ZDRlLTIyMzktNGUyZi05Yzc5LWEyYmVmYWRjNDUzMCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfTAMo-O1rnDHfQOXsGWlw_71Ety1g-6f-WiEAhABA0o&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-023-35876-8"><em><ins>Nature Communications</ins></em></a> on Tuesday. They warn that a longer epidemiological study is needed before they can conclusively say the use of UV drying devices leads to an increased risk of skin cancer, adding “it is likely that such studies will take at least a decade to complete and to subsequently inform the general public.”&nbsp;</p><p>You might think the advice here is to avoid UV dryers, but it's not so simple. Gel manicures have become an industry standard for a reason. For many people, regular nail polish starts to chip off after a day or so, making a traditional manicure often not worth the time, money or effort.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

## Wikipedia's first desktop design update in a decade doesn't rock the boat

<p>Wikipedia is finally getting its first major <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/news/2023/01/18/wikipedia-gets-a-fresh-new-look-first-desktop-update-in-a-decade-puts-usability-at-the-forefront/">redesign</a> in a decade, but it may be notable precisely because of how little it changes the core experience. The newly launched rework looks very familiar, and instead eliminates some common hassles. A new sticky header provides quick access to search and article sections, while a revised search shows images and descriptions as you type. It's easier to switch languages, and a table of contents helps you navigate content.</p><p><em>TechCrunch</em> also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/18/wikipedia-gets-its-first-makeover-in-over-a-decade-and-its-fairly-subtle/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">points</a> to smaller tweaks. A collapsible sidebar lets you remove distractions while reading. The default font size is larger, too, to reduce the strain on your eyes.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Wikipedia update is rolling out now for English users. Wikimedia has already made the update available to 300 of the 318 active languages on the site. It's already the default for Arabic and Greek readers. The team is still asking for feedback, so don't be surprised if the site continues to evolve.</p><p>Wikimedia Foundation makes clear that it hasn't removed any functionality, and that the changes led to real-world gains in testing with international volunteer groups. Users searched 30 percent more often, and scrolled 15 percent less. The redesign is meant to modernize Wikipedia by making it more accessible to a &quot;next generation&quot; of internet users who may not be very familiar with the web, according to the creators. You may not pay much notice to the changes if you're a diehard reader, then, but those just coming online may appreciate the ease of use.</p>

## Google is reportedly working on a location tracker like Apple's AirTag

<p>It was only a matter of time until Google launched its own location tracker, similar to Apple's AirTags, Samsung's SmartTag, and of course, Tile. According to the developer (and well-sourced leaker) <a href="https://twitter.com/Za_Raczke/status/1615062474826387492">Kuba Wojciechowski</a>, Google's Nest team is developing a tracker codenamed &quot;Grogu.&quot; It'll reportedly include an onboard speaker, as well as support for Bluetooth Low Energy and ultra-wideband (UWB). Wojciechowski found evidence of the tracker when he noticed that Google added support for locator tags in the developer hub for Fast Pair, the Android feature that lets you quickly connect Bluetooth devices.&nbsp;</p><p>While there aren't any specific details at this point, we can expect Google's tracker to work like the competition (attach it to whatever you like, and keep tabs on its location with your phone). It's also unclear if Google can replicate Apple's admittedly slick AirTag experience. Wojciechowski says that the Pixel 6 Pro and Pixel 7 Pro both shipped with UWB modules, which would allow them to direct you to nearby objects acccurately. But he notes that Google's &quot;finder&quot; network won't require UWB — BLE should be enough.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="84df3ec5c1bf4388a020e6696ee6375f"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">I have recently found references that show that Google's working on support for locator tags in Fast Pair - see the linked thread for more info. <a href="https://t.co/8tvlWaHQpv">https://t.co/8tvlWaHQpv</a><br /><br />Now it turns out Google's working on a first party tracker too!</p>— Kuba Wojciechowski⚡ (@Za_Raczke) <a href="https://twitter.com/Za_Raczke/status/1615062464747474959?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 16, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>While Google can't guarantee that every Android phone will ship with UWB, Wojciechowski says Google is working with chipset makers to help them support Fast Pair. That means we could see third-party trackers rounding out the location network, something it's hard to imagine Apple ever allowing. As for availability, Wojciechowski didn't find any specific timing, but he notes that it could be announced at I/O this year. That makes sense, as Google is already far behind the location tracking competition.<a href="https://twitter.com/Za_Raczke/status/1615062474826387492"><br /></a></p>

## 'Ultimate Sackboy' brings Sony's LittleBigPlanet mascot to mobile

<p>We’ve known for a while that Sony planned to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-hiring-for-playstation-mobile-games-194544791.html">bring PlayStation franchises to mobile platforms</a>, but we were hoping for something with a unique hook. Instead, Sony has partnered with the independent developer and publisher Exient (<em>Lemmings</em>, <em>Planet 53</em>) on a mobile game starring LittleBigPlanet’s Sackboy. <em>Ultimate Sackboy</em> is an auto-running game for Android and iOS, launching globally on February 21st.</p><p>The title follows a well-worn formula: control a cute auto-running mascot, jumping and swerving lanes to avoid obstacles while snagging power-ups. Like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-12-08-super-mario-run-iphone-hands-on.html"><em>Super Mario Run</em></a> and other genre standards, you’ll play with your phone in portrait orientation. The plot revolves around the crocheted hero competing in the Ultimate Games, which we imagine as an Olympics for semi-retired video game mascots living in an artisan-crafted world. Unsurprisingly, the game’s Google Play listing mentions ads and in-app purchases, consistent with the trailer’s emphasis on acquiring costumes and cosmetics.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="3dcdccee04e245bd8c028c2eac0a12b4"></div><p>Although we’d love to see publishers like Sony bring something more unique to their phone-based spinoffs, an auto-runner starring a beloved mascot ticks the boxes publishers prioritize on mobile: maximum micro-transaction potential with minimal investment in unique gameplay.</p><p>The public launch will follow the game’s closed betas in Australia, Canada, Ireland, Netherlands, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, Turkey and Malta. You can sign up to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.exient.sackboy">pre-register</a> on Google Play, and <a href="https://exient.us20.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=4257a760889a5e1a0d998ffc7&amp;id=43a9648417">this page</a> will notify you once it’s available on iOS (it will have iPhone and iPad versions).</p>

## Serato Studio 2.0 gets stem audio separation

<p>Serato launched DJ Pro 3.0 in December last year with new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/serato-dj-stems-audio-isolation-and-effects-200025497.html">stem separation tools</a> and it was only a matter of time until the company's DAW would follow suit. It’s only about a month later and already stems have arrived with the latest update dropping today: <a href="https://serato.com/studio">Serato Studio 2.0</a>.</p><p>The sampler section of Studio now includes small buttons above the waveform that allow you to target the vocals, melody, bass or drums from any track using Serato's own machine-learning algorithm. It does a great job isolating the respective stem segments quickly, at least once the system has a few seconds to analyze a track. You can then try out variations on-the-fly while a song is playing.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company recommends an M1 MacBook or higher for the best performance when using stems on Serato DJ and that should certainly carry over here. Although Studio is less of a live-performance tool than the DJ app, it helps to have software that allows relatively seamless adjustments as you go — especially processor-intensive stuff like this.</p><p>Stem separation has been a trend over the last year or two and Algoriddim's djay Pro, one of the other leading apps in the market, has had a version of this in its own DJ app for a few years. The company even spun the tools off into a standalone app called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/algoriddim-spins-off-its-ai-audio-tools-into-the-standalone-neural-mix-pro-app-140000289.html">Neural Mix Pro</a>. That lets you extract stems for use in other apps, but isn’t a complete workstation for making beats on its own.</p><p>Serato has been growing Studio’s toolset into a more comprehensive DAW over time. It's a helpful tool for pros who want a way to sketch out track ideas quickly and it's an approachable introduction for those just getting started with beat making. The addition of stems makes this an especially useful complement to Serato DJ, rounding out the ecosystem to include a DAW and DJ app with deeper customization abilities than ever before.&nbsp;</p><p>Serato Studio 2.0 is <a href="https://serato.com/studio/downloads">available today</a> on the company's website with <a href="https://serato.com/studio/pricing">options</a> including a free limited account, a $10 per-month subscription or you can purchase a full license for the app for $249.</p>

## Researchers find a more sustainable way to grow crops under solar panels

<p>Researchers say they have determined a way to make agrivoltaics — the process of growing crops underneath <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/solar%20panels/"><ins>solar panels</ins></a> — more efficient. They found that red wavelengths are more efficient for growing plants, while the blue part of the spectrum is better for producing solar energy. Solar panels that only allow red wavelengths of light to pass through could enable farmers to grow food more productively while generating power at the same time.</p><p><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c6c965be-a8ea-473d-89f4-9754f2675a60&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nature+Research&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjNmM5NjViZS1hOGVhLTQ3M2QtODlmNC05NzU0ZjI2NzVhNjAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmF0dXJlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9zNDE4OTMtMDE5LTAzNjQtNSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZGRiZWE0ZjMtYzg2MC00YjY2LTg2ZTAtY2VmZTUwMmVjYmIzIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAdhBV8JxcPjkl-A4ab8cHvyeXBfbpKbtmb41BTKKoFCh&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41893-019-0364-5"><ins>Previous studies</ins></a> have found that agrivoltaics can reduce the amount of water required for crops, since they're shaded from direct sunlight. Researchers at Michigan Technological University <a href="https://hal.science/hal-02113575/file/The_potential_of_agrivoltaic_systems.pdf"><ins>determined in 2015</ins></a> that shading can reduce water usage by up to 29 percent. Majdi Abou Najm, an associate professor at University of California, Davis' department of land, air and water resources, told <a href="https://modernfarmer.com/2023/01/solar-panels-light-spectrum/"><em><ins>Modern Farmer</ins></em></a> that by splitting the light spectrum, crops can get the same amount of carbon dioxide with less water while shielding them from heat.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The researchers put the idea to the test by growing tomatoes under blue and red filters, as well as a control crop without any coverings. Although the yield for the covered plots was about a third less than the control, the latter had around twice the amount of rotten tomatoes. Abou Najm noted that the filters helped to reduce heat stress and crop wastage.</p><figure><img alt="A blue filter over crops with a temperature reading super imposed." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/6e8b9a80-9764-11ed-b2fe-2a1152393609" style="height: 946; width: 1284;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Majdi Abou Najm/UC Davis</div></figure><p>For this approach to work in practice, though, manufacturers would need to develop translucent solar panels that capture blue light and allow red light to pass through.

These cells could be applied onto surfaces such as glass.</p><p>There are other issues, including the fact wavelength-selective agrivoltaic systems may need to account for different crop types. <a href="https://dot.la/solar-panel-crops-2658991025.html"><ins>Harvesting those crops</ins></a> efficiently might require some out-of-the-box thinking too. Still, the research seems promising and, with a growing global population, it's important to consider different approaches to using our resources more productively.</p><p>“We cannot feed 2 billion more people in 30 years by being just a little more water-efficient and continuing as we do,” <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/climate/news/harvesting-light-grow-food-and-clean-energy-together"><ins>Abou Najm said</ins></a>. “We need something transformative, not incremental. If we treat the sun as a resource, we can work with shade and generate electricity while producing crops underneath. Kilowatt hours become a secondary crop you can harvest.”</p>

## Twitter is reportedly struggling to break even as advertisers continue to flee

<p>Twitter’s ad business is reeling, with its daily revenue reportedly falling by 40 percent from a year ago. According to <em>The Information</em>, over 500 of the company’s top advertisers have <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVpbmZvcm1hdGlvbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvdHdpdHRlci1tYW5hZ2VyLWRhaWx5LXJldmVudWUtaGFzLWRyb3BwZWQtNDAtNTAwLXRvcC1hZHZlcnRpc2Vycy1oYXZlLWxlZnQiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImRhN2MwNDNiLWM1OTYtNDhlNC1iNTVkLTRiMWJmY2Q3ODgzOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAASFyJ_g9HJKhmAaDdFHyshocyIZSWXA05OY_en0Q1HTL&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theinformation.com%2Farticles%2Ftwitter-manager-daily-revenue-has-dropped-40-500-top-advertisers-have-left">paused spending</a> on the platform since Elon Musk’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-takes-over-twitter-011047797.html">October takeover</a>. Despite that, Twitter is still attracting and retaining media deals because it’s too lucrative for them to give it up.</p><p>Although Musk plans to diversify Twitter away from advertising, the company will likely struggle to break even this year. Since Twitter generated $1.2 billion in the first quarter of 2022, running 40 percent below that would mean it’s bringing in around $8 million daily (and about $720 million for the quarter). Getting in the black this year will depend on the company’s ability to generate $3 billion in revenue while paying $1.5 billion in annual interest from the debt Musk raised for the purchase.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The ad troubles could lead to more cost-cutting. Some big advertisers are reportedly unhappy with Musk’s approach to contact moderation, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-donald-trump-unbanned-elon-musk-023043690.html">reinstating Donald Trump</a> and firing executives in charge of curbing hate speech. Twitter’s workforce has already <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-reportedly-orders-layoffs-at-twitter-221121536.html">shrunk by about 75 percent</a> since Musk’s takeover, and it’s easy to imagine more layoffs on the horizon if the bleeding doesn’t stop.</p><p>However, Twitter can take some consolation in its ability to attract and retain media partners. According to <em>Axios</em>, the platform <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/01/17/twitter-media-sports-content-deals">still has deals</a> with over three dozen media companies, news outlets (including the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, <em>Reuters</em>, <em>Bloomberg</em>, <em>Forbes</em>, <em>Conde Nast</em> and <em>USA Today</em>) and sports leagues (including the NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB, NASCAR and PGA Tour) in the first half of this year. They find Twitter too profitable to quit in an uncertain economy — even while balking at embracing it publicly.</p>

## US law enforcement has warrantless access to many money transfers

A database stored at a nonprofit, the Transaction Record Analysis Center (TRAC), provides full names and amounts for larger transfers (above $500) sent between the US, Mexico and 22 other regions through services like Western Union, MoneyGram and Viamericas. The program covers data for numerous Caribbean and Latin American countries in addition to Canada, China, France, Malaysia, Spain, Thailand, Ukraine and the US Virgin Islands. Some domestic transfers also enter the data set.</p><p>The program exists to help agencies collect evidence of fraud and money laundering, as transfer services aren't required to know customers like banks. This has led to busts for drug cartels and other criminals, TRAC director Rich Leber explained to <em>The Journal</em>. The $500 threshold exists to prevent the system from collecting most data for immigrants remitting money to family in their home countries. Money transfer apps like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ios-15-5-180800179.html">Apple Cash</a>, Cash App, PayPal, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/venmo-payment-app-redesign-160045898.html">Venmo</a> and Zelle haven't provided data to TRAC, Wyden says.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You need to be a member of law enforcement with an active government email account to use the database, which is available through a publicly visible web portal. Leber told <em>The Journal</em> that there haven't been any known breaches or instances of law enforcement misuse. However, Wyden noted that the surveillance program included more states and countries than previously mentioned in briefings. There have also been subpoenas for bulk money transfer data from Homeland Security Investigations (which withdrew its request after Wyden's inquiry), the DEA and the FBI.</p><p>The concern, of course, is that officials can obtain sensitive transaction details without court oversight or customers' knowledge. An unscrupulous officer could secretly track large transfers. Wyden adds that the people in the database are more likely to be immigrants, minorities and low-income residents who don't have bank accounts and already have fewer privacy protectoins. The American Civil Liberties Union also <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/how-the-arizona-attorney-general-created-a-secretive-illegal-surveillance-program">asserts</a> that the subpoenas used to obtain this data violate federal law. Arizona issued at least 140 of these subpoenas between 2014 and 2021.</p><p>The Arizona attorney general's office hasn't responded to requests for comment. However, Wyden is already drafting legislation that would bolster privacy for money transfer services and effectively neuter the database. The ACLU, meanwhile, is unequivocal — it says the surveillance system "must be shut down." If nothing else, the findings could draw attention to privacy issues surrounding money transfers.</p>

<p>Former President Donald Trump has reportedly petitioned Meta to restore his Facebook account. According to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/donald-trump-prepares-return-facebook-twitter-rcna65809"><em>NBC News</em></a>, the Trump campaign sent a letter to the company on Tuesday, pushing for a meeting to discuss his “prompt reinstatement to the platform.” In 2020, Facebook banned Trump following the aftermath of the January 6th Capitol riot. At first, the suspension was set to last <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-locks-out-trump-24-hours-014550117.html">24 hours</a>, but the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facbook-donald-trump-joe-biden-155849567.html">made the ban indefinite</a> less than a day later. In June 2021, following a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-decision-trump-suspension-ban-130251901.html">recommendation from the Oversight Board</a>, Meta said it would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/donald-trump-could-be-back-on-facebook-in-time-for-primaries-164200140.html">revisit the suspension after two years</a> and “evaluate” the “risk to public safety” to determine if Trump should get his account back.</p><p>Meta did not immediately respond to Engadget’s comment request. The company told <em>NBC News </em>it would announce a decision “in the coming weeks in line with the process we laid out.” In 2021, Meta signaled Trump’s ban wouldn’t last forever. “When the suspension is eventually lifted, Mr Trump’s account will be subject to new enhanced penalties if he violates our policies, up to and including permanent removal of his accounts,” Nick Clegg, Meta’s president of global affairs, said at the time.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The letter is likely a bid by Trump to regain control of his Facebook account ahead of the 2024 presidential election. Trump has more than 34 million Facebook followers, and the platform was critical to his 2016 run. According to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-03/trump-s-campaign-said-it-was-better-at-facebook-facebook-agrees"><em>Bloomberg</em> report</a> published after the election, the Trump campaign ran 5.9 million different versions of ads to test the ones that got the most engagement from the company’s users. Meta subsequently <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2019/10/31/introducing-graph-api-v5-marketing-api-v5/">put a limit on high-volume advertising</a>. One Trump Organization employee told <em>NBC News </em>that change<em>&nbsp;</em>prevented Trump’s 2020 campaign from using Facebook the way it did in 2016.</p>

<p>Ahead of the next inevitable round of herp de derp "Skynet iz here" hot takes on social media, Boston Dynamics showed off more of its Atlas robot's stunning agility and dexterity in <a href="https://twitter.com/BostonDynamics/status/1615728730969710592">a new demo video Wednesday morning</a>. This time, <a href="https://www.bostondynamics.com/resources/blog/sick-tricks-and-tricky-grips">the humanoid machine had to deliver a tool bag</a> to the top of some scaffolding using only <a href="https://www.engadget.com/boston-dynamics-atlas-robots-parkour-demo-141057531.html">its roboparkour powers</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="e9050478a99b4ef7bd66c349abae228e"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">It’s time for Atlas to pick up a new set of skills and get hands on. <a href="https://t.co/osOWiiBlSh">pic.twitter.com/osOWiiBlSh</a></p>— Boston Dynamics (@BostonDynamics) <a href="https://twitter.com/BostonDynamics/status/1615728730969710592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 18, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>In the video above, Atlas shows a surprising amount of forethought, grabbing and placing a wooden plank across a large gap before heading over to pick up the tool bag itself. From there, it's a simple matter of climbing a set of stairs, balancing across said plank, hopping up a couple ledges, jump spinning in place to turn around and gently hucking the bag over its head to the platform above. That's all before it shoves a box off its platform — carefully avoiding not tilting over the side itself and then, "dismounting with an inverted 540-degree flip that project engineers have dubbed the Sick Trick,'" according to <a href="https://www.bostondynamics.com/resources/blog/sick-tricks-and-tricky-grips">Wednesday's release</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“Parkour forces us to understand the physical limitations of the robot, and dance forces us to think about how precise and dexterous the whole-body motion can be,” Robin Deits, a software engineer on the Atlas controls team, said in that release. “Now, manipulation is forcing us to take that information and interpret it in terms of how we can get the hands to do something specific. What’s important about the Atlas project is that we don’t let go of any of those other things we’ve learned.”&nbsp;</p><p>Except none of that is "a simple matter." At the start of the decade, bipedal robots would wilt if you looked at them sideways, much less <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy55b3V0dWJlLmNvbS93YXRjaD92PVZUbFYwWTV5QXd3IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3ZWQ1OGRkOC1lMWU2LTQyYTYtYTVhOS03N2RjOTJhNzg1ZDAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAATSl7F9elM_G5GcTDFcCu2AUZe9FbIvWBsSgKnR2mc5t&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DVTlV0Y5yAww">asked them to climb a set of stairs</a>. In 2015, robots were still so janky that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-06-05-robots-r-dumb.html">we ran supercuts of them falling down</a>.

It's a damn good thing the company, along with six other robotics industry leaders, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/boston-dynamics-and-other-industry-heavyweights-pledge-not-to-build-war-robots-190338338.html">has pledged not to use its legion of bag-delivery bots for war</a>.&nbsp;</p><div id="bcc6ff33aeb045c5abf4d1cbae09d556"></div><p>But don't expect an Atlas to replace your local UPS driver anytime soon (for one, their union would never allow it) because for as impressive as this video is, it took a substantial amount of time and effort to develop. As you can see in the behind-the-scenes video above, Atlas suffered dents, scrapes, scratches, and more than a few tumbles in learning this routine.&nbsp;</p><p>"This is more a demonstration of some of the robot’s new control capabilities, and a fun connection to our prior work,” Scott Kuindersma, Atlas team lead said. “Our hope is that, if we can build the foundational technology that allows us to easily create and adapt dynamic behaviors like these, we should be able to leverage it down the road to perform real, physically-demanding jobs with hustle. There are many pieces required to deliver a complete solution in a domain like manufacturing or construction—this video highlights a narrow slice of what we’re working on.” So maybe it isn't so much the hyper-agile acrobots we need to worry about as it is the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/san-francisco-police-seek-permission-for-its-robots-to-use-deadly-force-183514906.html">EOD machines armed with high explosives and piloted by the cops</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You might not need to buy the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-homepod-2023-announced-price-specs-141225333.html">second-generation large HomePod</a> to get additional smart home features — they could already be present in the speaker you have. <em>MacRumors</em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/homepods-now-feature-temperature-humidity-sensor/">notes</a> that Apple's HomePod product <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MTMwZTJmMC1hMTRmLTRjNWUtYmRhYi1jZDUyYWM3ZDhlNzkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL2hvbWVwb2QtMm5kLWdlbmVyYXRpb24vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIxMDg2Njc4Mi0xYjU2LTQyNjQtOTA5ZC1mMDM4ZjFiYjNjYTkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZWcZy33V0gJAh5cSB15eWzwyLOK8yp8aW6cjWgyzNWG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fhomepod-2nd-generation%2F">comparison section</a> (scroll to the bottom) now says the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-homepod-mini-review-140030652.html">HomePod mini</a> has a temperature and humidity sensor, just like its more expensive counterpart. Given that the sensor <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-homepod-mini-inactive-temperature-humidity-sensor-161634669.html">has been dormant</a> since the mini launched in 2020, it appears that Apple is activating the functionality on the more affordable hardware. We've asked Apple if it can provide more details.</p><p>The temperature and humidity sensor lets you control smart home devices based on interior conditions. You can automatically close your smart blinds when it gets too hot, for instance. The HomePod mini is already known to be getting the sound recognition update that can detect smoke and carbon monoxide alarms and send notifications. That software arrives in the spring.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are still reasons to buy the bigger HomePod besides raw speaker quality. You don't get room sensing or spatial audio with the HomePod mini. For everything else, though, the mini should do the trick. The question is whether or not any expanded functionality is enough to clinch a purchase. Amazon Echo speakers have had temperature sensors <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-20-amazons-new-echo-plus-has-a-temperature-sensor-and-a-better-spe.html">for years</a>, and they can also play Apple Music. Google's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-audio-review-143012511.html">Nest Audio</a> doesn't have the sensor tech, but it should sound better. The mini makes the most sense if you like its tighter integration with the Apple ecosystem.</p>

## Shell is buying EV charging company Volta for $169 million

<p>Oil and gas company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/shell/"><ins>Shell</ins></a> is buying electric vehicle charging operator <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/volta/"><ins>Volta</ins></a> for $169 million through a subsidiary. The deal, which the companies expect to close in the first half of this year, amounts to 86 cents per share, around 18 percent more than Volta's closing price on Tuesday.</p><p>Volta's board of directors approved the deal unanimously, though it still requires the green light from shareholders. It's subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions too. Shell will provide loans to Volta to give it a hand through the closing of the transaction. <a href="https://investors.voltacharging.com/news/news-details/2022/Volta-Inc.-Reports-Third-Quarter-Financial-Results/default.aspx"><ins>On September 30th</ins></a>, Volta had $15.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared with $262.2 million at the end of 2021.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;While the EV infrastructure market opportunity is potentially enormous, Volta's ability to capture it independently, in challenging market conditions and with ongoing capital constraints, was limited,&quot; Volta interim CEO Vince Cubbage <a href="https://voltacharging.com/press/volta-inc-to-be-acquired-by-shell-usa-inc"><ins>said in a statement</ins></a>. &quot;Both Volta and Shell have a demonstrated ability to meet the changing needs of customers, and this acquisition will bring that experience together to provide the options that are needed as more drivers choose electric.&quot;</p><p>The company has more than 3,000 charging stations across the US and a handful in Europe, typically at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volta-walgreens-ev-fast-charging-stations-115559815.html"><ins>grocery stores and malls</ins></a>. For a few years, its DC fast charging stations were <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-01-volta-free-fast-ev-charging-stations.html"><ins>free to use for up to 30 minutes</ins></a>, with advertising and sponsorships helping to cover the costs. However, it <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/whtsdf/volta_dc_fast_charging_not_free_anymore/"><ins>shifted</ins></a> its DC fast chargers to a paid model last year.

After the deal closes, &quot;there will be no immediate change in driver experience,&quot; the companies said.</p><p>Odd as it may seem that an oil company is buying an EV charging network, it isn't the first time Shell has done so. It snapped up UK network Ubitricity <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ubitricity-m-a-shell-idUSKBN29U0TC"><ins>in 2021</ins></a> for an undisclosed sum.

## Microsoft will lay off 10,000 employees as it cuts costs

<p>The rumors of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-could-lay-off-as-many-as-11000-employees-this-week-204254529.html">massive layoffs at Microsoft</a> were true. In a publicly posted memo from CEO Satya Nadella, the company says it <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/01/18/subject-focusing-on-our-short-and-long-term-opportunity/">plans to cut</a> 10,000 jobs through its third fiscal quarter, which ends in March. The move is meant to &quot;align [Microsoft's] cost structure&quot; with demand and revenue, according to Nadella — that is, to slash expenses as sales shrink. Customers boosted their digital spending during the height of the pandemic, Nadella says, but they're now scaling back. Numerous countries are either in the midst of recessions or expecting them, the executive adds.</p><p>Microsoft will continue to hire in &quot;key strategic areas,&quot; Nadella says. The company is taking on a $1.2 billion  restructuring charge for the severance costs, consolidating building leases and unspecified changes to its hardware lineup. Nadella notes that US staff will get &quot;above-market&quot; severance pay as well as six months of continued healthcare coverage and stock awards.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As <em>GeekWire</em><a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/full-memo-microsoft-to-cut-10k-jobs-about-5-of-workforce-and-take-1-2b-restructuring-charge/">explains</a>, this is the second-largest round of layoffs in Microsoft's history. The company cut <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-07-17-microsoft-cuts-18-000-jobs-as-part-its-largest-layoff-ever.html">18,000 jobs in 2014</a> as a newly-promoted Nadella scaled back Nokia's hardware business. Microsoft hired aggressively during the pandemic, recruiting 40,000 workers in fiscal 2022. Some of those came through buyouts, such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-buys-nuance-19-7-billion-speech-tech-cloud-ai-healthcare-125718786.html">speech tech heavyweight Nuance</a> (6,500 employees) and AT&amp;T's former ad tech wing Xandr (1,500 people). Microsoft's headcount is still larger than it was before the pandemic began, but this is still a sharp direction change.</p><p>The company isn't alone in shedding jobs. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-mass-layoffs-facebook-111406126.html">Meta laid off more than 11,000 employees</a> last fall as a bet on continued pandemic-era growth didn't pay off. Amazon, meanwhile, expects to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-expanded-job-cuts-18000-102059372.html">drop over 18,000 jobs</a> located primarily in its retail and recruiting divisions. Salesforce recently axed 10 percent of employees. The tech industry is grappling with a tougher economic reality, and Microsoft isn't immune to those problems.</p>

We still wouldn't expect the new version to last long with more demanding titles, but it might be better-suited to extended casual game sessions.</p><p>The Windows-based Air Plus will be available in two lower-end Intel configurations (Celeron and Core i3) as well as speedier AMD models (Ryzen 5 7520U and Ryzen 7 6800U). Performance should scale the more you're willing to spend, then. Final pricing isn't available, but Ayaneo expects to start pre-orders after Lunar New Year celebrations end on February 5th.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Ayaneo Air Slide" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/c4ac8e90-9734-11ed-99fa-3da5a8fb11b9" style="height: 1280; width: 1920;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Ayaneo, YouTube</div></figure><p>The company is also expanding into sliders with (what else?) the Ayaneo Slide. To some degree, it's an answer to the GPD Win 4 — you can pop the screen up when you need a keyboard for text input or simply navigating games that aren't gamepad-friendly. Ayaneo said little else about the Slide during its event, but did confirm the system would be based on AMD's recently-launched <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amds-ryzen-7000-mobile-cpus-16-core-033046361.html">Ryzen 7000 mobile APUs</a> and ship sometime in the second quarter of the year.</p><p>It's too soon to say how well Ayaneo's latest offerings fare against its biggest rival, Valve's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-review-small-hands-180026719.html">Steam Deck</a>. The company has promised an updated front end (Ayaspace 2), but it's not clear if this will be enough to overcome the limitations of running Windows on a handheld.

<p>A few big names in the smart home space, iRobot and Shark in particular, have jumped on the robot-vacuum-and-mop bandwagon as of late. The two companies recently came out with their first 2-in-1 devices, and now you can pick up Shark's at its best price yet.

The new 2-in-1 device seems to take a lot of notes from the standard model: you're getting a disk-like robot vacuum along with a bagless, self-emptying base into which the machine will dump the contents of its dustbin after every job.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The big difference here is the included water reservoir and the washable, reusable mopping pads that come with the 2-in-1 machine. It'll employ those when cleaning hardwood floors using a sonic mopping technique that supposedly scrubs floors up to 100 times per minute. If you have a mix of carpet, hardwood, tile and other flooring in your home, a 2-in-1 device like Shark's will make it more convenient to clean all of those surfaces in one go.</p><p>In addition to that new feature, this Shark robot vacuum has improved suction power, flexible silicon "fins" on its underside that help pick up more dirt and debris, obstacle avoidance and smart home mapping. Like most other robot vacuums, you can set cleaning schedules within Shark's companion app, which we think will be easy to use for both the tech-savvy and newbies alike. And we especially like that its base is bagless — that means you don't have to buy proprietary trash bags to fill it with like you do with some competitors.</p><p>Shark's device joins a number of other robo-vacs on sale right now.

## Apple's larger HomePod returns with upgraded audio and more smart home tools

<p>Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-homepod-smart-speaker-014943611.html">discontinued</a> its original HomePod smart speaker in 2021, choosing instead to focus on the cheaper <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-homepod-mini-review-140030652.html">mini version</a> of the device. Today, the company has resurrected the bigger unit with several notable upgrades along the way, including upgraded audio, an S7 chip, more smart home abilities and a lower price. The overall design, however, is mostly unchanged from the first speaker that debuted in 2018.</p><p>Apple says the retooled HomePod audio delivers &quot;rich, deep bass and stunning high frequencies.&quot; More specifically, a custom-made woofer, diaphragm motor, bass EQ mic and a group of five tweeters are all part of the sonic setup. An S7 chip and software combine for computational audio that the company says &quot;maximizes the full potential&quot; of the unit. HomePod is equipped with room sensing tech, so it can read sound reflections to determine its position (near a wall or in free space) and adjust the audio in real time. And of course, Spatial Audio via Apple Music is available on the new device.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>HomePod can be arranged with another unit or a HomePod mini for a multiroom setup via AirPlay. You can either play the same song on all of them, a different song on each or use the entire group as an intercom. With Apple's Ultra Wideband tech, you can hand off the audio playing on your iPhone (even a call) to a HomePod with ease. And you can still use two HomePod speakers as a stereo pair — with an Apple TV, for example. Once synced, the two units separate audio in to left and right channels for a wider soundstage in a home theater setup. Thanks to the eARC connection on the Apple TV 4K, a pair of connected HomePod units can function as the audio setup for all devices hooked up to your TV.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Developing...</em></p>

## Weber updates its SmokeFire smart grill for better searing

<p>The &quot;official&quot; start of grilling season may be a few months away, but Weber is unveiling its 2023 lineup with plenty of time to spare. Today, the company revealed a trio of new models covering smart pellet grills, griddles and a compact electric unit. Weber also has new options when it comes to accessories it hopes will help you expand the utility of a grill you may already own.</p><p>First, the company has a new version of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/weber-smokefire-review-wifi-pellet-grill-140000499.html">SmokeFire smart pellet grill</a>. Dubbed the Sear+, this model carries all of the features of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/weber-2022-grill-lineup-genesis-smokefire-weber-connect-140518150.html">last year's Stealth edition</a>. That includes an all-black exterior with interior lighting. The key difference here is the Sear+ is better equipped for — you guessed it — searing. A two-sided porcelain enamel searing grate gives you the ability to cook both larger cuts and more delicate items. Also inside, a removable, folding top cooking grate adds more capacity. When you don't need it, Weber has added grate hooks for storage outside. There's also an additional side shelf on the left which should give you more room to prep foods before they go on the grill.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Of course, the versatility that's been constant since the SmokeFire line was introduced in 2020 is still here. Like most pellet grills, these can handle low-and-slow barbecue, high-heat searing and everything in between with a temperature range of 200-600 degrees Fahrenheit. However, the key piece of Weber's pellet grills is its Connect smart cooking tech. The system works with an app on your phone to give you step-by-step guidance for a massive library of recipes. It will even tell you when to wrap a pork butt or flip your steaks. The tech also calculates estimated completion times on top giving you the ability to monitor food and grill temps from afar. You can even adjust the cooking temperature from your couch if needed.</p><p>The SmokeFire Sear+ will be available in 24- and 36-inch sizes (ELX4 and ELX6 model names) from Weber and other retailers this spring for $1,399 and $1,599 respectively.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="Weber Genesis griddle" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/7f5a2a70-96a1-11ed-bfb6-633a99f83d2f" style="height: 1488; width: 2000;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Weber</div></figure><p>When it comes to the Weber Connect smart cooking tech, the company is planning a big overhaul for 2023. In addition to more content and optimization for the app, the company plans to add recipes for flat top or griddle cooking. That's because Weber is debuting griddle inserts for its Genesis and Spirit gas grills ($199, $249 and $299), some of which have Weber Connect built in. Existing Connect programs will still work even if you're using the flat top, but more fine-tuned cook profiles are coming. The company also revealed a standalone gas griddle that comes in 3- and 4-burner options (28- and 36-inch cooking surfaces) starting at $449. Weber Connect doesn't come on that unit though, but you can use the standalone <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-03-weber-connect-smart-grilling-hub-review.html">Smart Grilling Hub</a> if you're looking for some guidance or remote monitoring. Both the griddle insert and the new Weber Griddle will be available this spring.&nbsp;</p><p>The third piece of news from Weber to begin 2023 is a compact electric grill it calls Lumin. Designed to be used in places like porches and balconies where open flames aren't allowed, this model can hit temperatures of over 600 degrees Fahrenheit. Weber says Lumin can be ready for high-heat searing in 15 minutes. Grill controls are simplified to four modes — grill, smoke, steam and warm — with accessories available to help with each cooking method. Unlike a lot of electric grills, Weber has left the heating element exposed, so when juices drip they will help flavor your food like they would on a charcoal or gas grill.&nbsp;</p><p>The Weber Lumin is available today in six color options and in two sizes. The &quot;compact&quot; model is $429 for black and $459 for additional colors while the &quot;full-size&quot; version is $479 in black and $519 in other hues.</p><figure><img alt="Weber Lumin grill" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/7f5ac6b0-96a1-11ed-bf97-e7f86a887881" style="height: 1334; width: 2000;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Weber</div></figure>

## The Morning After: Getty Images sues AI art generator

<p>Getty Images announced it’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/getty-images-sues-the-maker-of-ai-art-generator-stable-diffusion-over-data-scraping-allegations-184502897.html%20https://www.engadget.com/...">suing Stability AI</a>, makers of the AI art tool Stable Diffusion, over alleged copyright violations. &quot;It is Getty Images’ position that Stability AI unlawfully copied and processed millions of images protected by copyright and the associated metadata owned or represented by Getty Images absent a license to benefit Stability AI’s commercial interests and to the detriment of the content creators,&quot; the company wrote in a press statement released Tuesday. The lawsuit will reportedly include copyright and site TOS violations, like web scraping. The company wants to establish a favorable precedent, rather than chase monetary damages.</p><p>Text-to-image generation tools, like Stable Diffusion and Dall-E, are trained to do what they do using massive databases of annotated images, pulling together thousands of commonalities. That’s why Getty’s huge stable of images is so compelling. An <a href="https://waxy.org/2022/08/exploring-12-million-of-the-images-used-to-train-stable-diffusions-image-generator/">independent study last August</a> concluded that a notable portion of Stable Diffusion's data was likely pulled directly from the Getty Images site. The art tool had a tendency to recreate the Getty watermark in its generated images. I think that’s what they call evidence.</p><p>– Mat Smith</p><h3></h3><h3>The biggest stories you might have missed</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/hue-app-failures-170002235.html">What happens when smart bulbs meet dumb software?</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/canon-eos-r-6-ii-review-an-excellent-hybrid-camera-with-few-flaws-140005140.html">Canon EOS R6 II review: An excellent hybrid camera with few flaws</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-sale-tp-link-routers-smart-home-gadgets-132551567.html">Amazon has a big sale on TP-Link routers and smart home gadgets</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-last-of-us-hbo-debut-viewers-155019850.html">'The Last of Us' is HBO's third largest debut of the streaming era</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/topre-realforce-r2-pfu-keyboard-irl-153030722.html">What we bought: Topre’s Realforce keyboard is totally impractical, but I can’t go back</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-could-lay-off-as-many-as-11000-employees-this-week-204254529.html">Microsoft could lay off as many as 11,000 employees this week </a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-affordable-windows-laptops-123000512.html">The best cheap Windows laptops for 2023</a></p></li></ul><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-updates-its-mac-book-pros-with-m-2-pro-and-max-chips-143848558.html">Apple's M2 Pro and M2 Max chips finally arrive for MacBook Pro and Mac mini</a></h2><h3>Sometimes the rumors are right.</h3><h3></h3><p>Apple has unveiled its new M2 Pro and M2 Max chips, which will arrive very soon in new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro and Mac mini computers.

The ISOCELL HP2 is a relatively large (for a smartphone) Type 1/1.3 sensor (around 12mm diagonally). The HP2 uses something Samsung calls Dual Vertical Transfer Gate (D-VTG) technology. This essentially doubles the number of electrons from each photodiode, &quot;boosting the pixel's full-well capacity by more than 33 percent,&quot; the company wrote. That means a pixel can hold more charge before saturating, reducing overexposure. Last year’s Galaxy S22 Ultra &quot;only&quot; had a 108MP sensor, but rumors suggest the S23 Ultra will have a 200MP sensor – and the HP2 fits the bill.

<p>Twitter is now offering a yearly discount on its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-twitter-blue-now-available-190106760.html">Blue subscription service</a>, according to a new <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-blue">support page</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/17/23559959/twitter-blue-annual-subscription-discount-offer"><em>The Verge</em></a>. Web users can now sign up for $84 per year ($7 per month) and save a buck over the monthly $8 price.

## CNET is reviewing its AI-written articles after being notified of serious errors

<p>If you visit any of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cnet-gets-caught-playing-ai-mad-libs-with-its-financial-news-coverage-001026432.html"><em>CNET's AI-written articles</em></a>, you'll now see an editor's note at the top that says: &quot;We are currently reviewing this story for accuracy. If we find errors, we will update and issue corrections.&quot; The publication has added the note after being notified of major errors in at least one of the machine-written financial explainers it had published.&nbsp;</p><p>If you'll recall, <em>CNET</em> editor-in-chief Connie Guglielmo recently <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/cnet-is-experimenting-with-an-ai-assist-heres-why/">admitted</a> that the publication had put out around 75 articles about basic financial topics since November last year. Guglielmo said the website decided to do an experiment to see if AI can truly be used in newsrooms and other information-based services in the coming months and years. Based on <a href="https://futurism.com/cnet-ai-errors"><em>Futurism's</em></a> report, it looks like the answer is: Sure, but the pieces it generates need to thoroughly fact-checked by a human editor.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Futurism</em> combed through one of the articles Guglielmo highlighted in the post, namely the piece entitled &quot;What Is Compound Interest?&quot;, and found a handful of serious errors. While the article has since been corrected, the <a href="https://archive.is/aWnq5">original version</a> said that &quot;you'll earn $10,300 at the end of the first year&quot; — instead of just $300 — if you deposit $10,000 into an account that earns 3 percent interest compounding annually. The AI also made errors in explaining loan interest rate payments and certificates of deposit or CDs.&nbsp;</p><p>You'll find a huge difference in quality when comparing <em>CNET's</em> articles with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/allmetsports/2016-fall/games/football/87473/">machine-written pieces</a> in previous years, which read more like a bunch of facts thrown together rather than coherent stories. As <em>Futurism</em> notes, the errors it found highlight the biggest issue with the current generation of AI text generators: They may be capable of responding in a human-like manner, but they still struggle with sifting out inaccuracies.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Models like ChatGPT have a notorious tendency to spew biased, harmful, and factually incorrect content,&quot; <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/01/17/1067014/heres-how-microsoft-could-use-chatgpt/"><em>MIT's Tech Review</em></a> wrote in a piece examining how Microsoft could use <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-reportedly-integrating-chatgpt-technology-into-bing-131502579.html">OpenAI's ChatGPT tech with Bing</a>. &quot;They are great at generating slick language that reads as if a human wrote it. But they have no real understanding of what they are generating, and they state both facts and falsehoods with the same high level of confidence.&quot; That said, OpenAI recently <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/openai-chatgpt-update/476116/#close">rolled out an update</a> to ChatGPT meant to &quot;improve accuracy and factuality.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>As for <em>CNET</em>, a spokesperson told <em>Futurism</em> in a statement: &quot;We are actively reviewing all our AI-assisted pieces to make sure no further inaccuracies made it through the editing process, as humans make mistakes, too. We will continue to issue any necessary corrections according to <em>CNET's</em> correction policy.&quot;</p>

## TikTok is expanding its labels for state-run media accounts to more countries, including China

<p>TikTok <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktoks-state-affiliated-media-policy"><ins>is expanding</ins></a> its use of labels for state-run media accounts, the company announced. The app is now bringing the tags, which identify “accounts run by organizations whose editorial output or decision-making process is subject to control or influence by a government,” to dozens of markets.</p><p>The company is relatively late to adopt such labels compared with most of its counterparts. YouTube added similar labels <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/02/02/media/youtube-state-funded-media-label/index.html"><ins>in 2018</ins></a>, while <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-labels-state-controlled-media-ads-171003061.html"><ins>Meta</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-labels-state-media-and-government-accounts-173350020.html"><ins>Twitter</ins></a> adopted them in 2020. TikTok only began labeling state-run media accounts <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/bringing-more-context-to-content-on-tiktok"><ins>last March</ins></a>, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But the labels, which the company described as a “pilot,” only applied to accounts from Russia, Ukraine and Belarus.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Now, TikTok says it has formalized its policy and “will begin applying our state-controlled media label in a phased approach, starting immediately with over 40 markets across multiple regions.” And while the company’s announcement doesn’t name specific countries, a TikTok spokesperson confirmed the labels will appear on accounts run by Chinese state media outlets.</p><figure><img alt="TikTok is expanding labels identifying state-run media organizations." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/c913ed80-96ca-11ed-bbfc-ac6ecf61091a" style="height: 1080; width: 1920;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">TikTok</div></figure><p>That’s notable as TikTok has long been viewed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/why-trump-wants-to-ban-tiktok-201019879.html"><ins>with suspicion</ins></a> by lawmakers and government officials over concerns about the company’s perceived ties to the Chinese government.

Of course, the labels alone are unlikely to dispel critics’ suspicions of the company.

It also comes with a privacy shutter that rotates around to block the lens. It supports 1080p at up to 30 fps and 720p at 60 fps and connects to any USB-C port (you'll need to buy an adapter for USB-A).

## Apple is reportedly working on a cheaper mixed-reality headset

<p>Apple is already working on a more affordable version of its yet-to-be-announced mixed reality headset, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-18/apple-postpones-ar-glasses-plans-cheaper-mixed-reality-headset?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> and <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVpbmZvcm1hdGlvbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvYXBwbGUtd29ya2luZy1vbi1jaGVhcGVyLW1peGVkLXJlYWxpdHktaGVhZHNldC10by1yZWFjaC1tb3JlLWNvbnN1bWVycz9yYz13aGYwZmQiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImY4ZTRhMGYxLTdhNDYtNGVjZC1hMTFmLWYyNTk2OWFlZDk5MCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAawYK3DKOYnaO9zlOyg6HrwowXx0A6eJoxPo_tAww8bG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theinformation.com%2Farticles%2Fapple-working-on-cheaper-mixed-reality-headset-to-reach-more-consumers%3Frc%3Dwhf0fd"><em>The Information</em></a>. Based on previous reports about the long-rumored mixed reality device, it will cost around $3,000, which is double the price of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-quest-pro-review-a-next-gen-headset-for-the-vr-faithful-specs-price-130045313.html">Quest Pro headset Meta</a> released last year. Apple's engineers are reportedly working to develop a more budget-friendly version that's closer to the price of the Quest Pro and are already discussing strategies to achieve that goal, such as using cheaper components.&nbsp;</p><p>While the flagship device will have 4K internal displays for each eye, its more affordable counterpart will likely use ones with lower resolution. The company's engineers are also considering the use of fewer cameras and slower processors, which would, in turn, eliminate the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-vr-standalone-headset-fabric-fan-prescription-lenses-bloomberg-130143142.html">need for internal fans</a>. Apple might ask users to manually adjust their field of view for the cheaper headset instead of equipping it with a motor that can automatically do that. It might choose not to equip the device with its custom H2 wireless chip that would allow it to work better with AirPods, as well. A <em>Bloomberg</em> report earlier this month claimed the tech giant is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-wireless-chips-iphone-to-replace-broadcom-qualcomm-143010106.html">developing its own Bluetoot</a>h and WiFi chip to replace Broadcom's by 2025.<em> The Information</em> said Apple could also choose to use that in-house chip to prevent a third-party company from affecting the device's pricing.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The cheaper mixed reality headset is in its very early stages, the sources reported, and Apple has yet to build a working prototype. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, though, the majority of Apple's 1,000-person Technology Development Group is working on the two headsets and that the company could release it next year or in 2025. As a result of this dual-device strategy, though, Apple has reportedly put its plans to launch lightweight augmented reality glasses on hold. The company's original vision was to create AR glasses that could <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-11-apple-ar-headset-2022.html">one day replace the iPhone</a>, but it has now scaled back work on the project. It's now apparently unclear if the AR glasses will ever launch.&nbsp;</p><p>As for Apple's flagship mixed reality headset, <em>Bloomberg</em> previously said that the company plans to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-long-rumored-mixed-reality-headset-could-finally-arrive-this-spring-163258260.html">formally announce</a> it this spring ahead of WWDC in June.&nbsp;</p>
