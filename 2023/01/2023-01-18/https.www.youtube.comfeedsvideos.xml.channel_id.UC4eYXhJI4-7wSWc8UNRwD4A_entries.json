A little less than exactly three years ago, Allison had just released the wonderful Color Theory as Soccer Mommy; it's an album that marked significant strides in her songwriting and production. A big year was doubtless in store for her and her bandmates... and we all know how that went. The band's visit to the Tiny Desk, scheduled for March 30, 2020, was the first of many to be canceled due to the pandemic.\n\nThat time in history required a lot of lemonade-making from all of us; we at NPR Music and beyond were lucky that, not too long after lockdown had sunk its teeth in, Soccer Mommy was the first to record a Tiny Desk (Home) performance for us. It was an early, much-needed sign that life might still be waiting for us on the other end. But, as we've learned well, there's no replacement for proximity.\n\nWith all of that indelibly in mind, it was particularly lovely and emotional welcoming Sophie, guitarist Julian Powell, keyboard player Rodrigo Avendano, bassist Nickolas Widener and percussionist Rollum Haas, finally, to the Tiny Desk. Their four-song set, with work from each era of Soccer Mommy's catalog, is beautifully performed and contoured. Welcome back to your debut, Soccer Mommy.\n\n\nSET LIST\n\"Shotgun\"\n\"circle the drain\"\n\"newdemo\"\n\"Still Clean\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nSophie Allison - vocals, guitar \nJulian Powell - guitar \nRodrigo Avendano - keyboards\nNickolas Widener - bass \nRollum Haas - drum machine\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nDirector/Editor: Maia Stern\nAudio Engineer: Neil Tevault \nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Sofia Seidel, Kara Frame\nAudio Assistant: Brian Jarboe\nProduction Assistant: Jill Britton\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Josh Rogosin, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Ashley Pointer\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #soccermommy", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}], "source": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "NPR Music"}}
