I flew out to CA for a </span>

<a href="https://contracarnivale.org/">gig</a>
this weekend, and two of my kids 

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/playing-dances-with-a-kid">came along</a>. We got into SFO
late Thursday night, 

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/tesla-model-3-review">drove</a> to
San Jose to sleep, and got to the gig on Friday. We took rapid tests,
all negative. A late night, and the kids fell asleep backstage in the
keyboard case:

Saturday morning one was mostly fine, but the other was sleepy ("jet
lag"). She stayed sleepy all day, napping more backstage, and she
wasn't eating much ("different food than she usually eats"). After
choosing what food we should get for dinner she wouldn't eat it and
was cranky ("seems more 'sick' than 'jet lag'"). Another rapid
test [1] immediate positive:

</p>

<p>

So I'm 3,000 miles from home with two kids, one of which has the
contagious disease everyone's spent the last three years
avoiding. We're scheduled to check out by noon tomorrow, drive back to
SFO, and take a red-eye home. What do I do?

</p>

<p>

Two options:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<ul>

<li>Isolate in place.

</li>
<li>Fly home anyway.

</li>
</ul>



<p>

Earlier in the pandemic this would have been a clear choice: isolate
in place. It was required by public health order, and especially
before vaccination traveling would have been too much risk to others
and contribution to pandemic spread.

</p>

<p>

On the other hand, pre-covid I think almost everyone would have gone
home.  If you <a href="https://www.drstevesilvestro.com/can-a-sick-child-fly-on-an-airplane">read</a>
<a href="https://tripswithtykes.com/tips-for-traveling-with-a-sick-child/">advice</a>
it was mostly about how to decide whether to cancel a vacation or how
to keep a sick kid comfortable on a plane.  While there's some "<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/TRAVEL/11/23/flying.with.flu/">if you're
sick, don't fly</a>", the examples were whether to begin a trip, not
whether to return home.  Discussion of "well enough to fly" was about
whether you were up to it, not about risk to others.  And of course
there's no discussion of when you should wear a mask to protect others
in the terminal or on the plane.

</p>

<p>

At this point, however, we are partway through a transition to
treating covid as a normal disease. While the CDC recommendation is
still <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html">not
to fly</a>, this was also what they recommended for people with
similar illness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130523150301/http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/health-status">pre-covid</a>,
and they recommend other things that most people aren't doing like
masking when local covid levels are high.  Airlines are back to
charging <a href="https://www.jetblue.com/covid-19-info-hub">change
fees</a> even with a positive test.

</p>

<p>

Isolating in place is at least four more days in CA, more if someone
else gets sick (which did happen).  Maybe six days in expectation?
With flight change fees ($300), rental car extension ($400), and more
days in the hotel ($600) this is $1,300+.  Possibly we need a second
room ($600) to separate the sick and well.  Then there's dealing with
food (probably delivery, more money) and work (with my wrist and neck
issues this would need a more ergonomic setup than a laptop on a desk,
so either more money or not working).  It's possible, we could do
it if we had to, but it's a lot.

</p>

<p>

I decided we'd fly home.  We stayed as far away from others as
possible in the terminals and kept our (K)N95s on the whole
time&#8212;normally I let the kids take their masks off on the plane
once the HEPA-filtered air is running and I've adjusted their blowers
to 'full'.  We got home Monday morning, and have been isolating since,
including from each other.

</p>

<p>

Was this the right choice?  I still don't know.  I don't want to be a
chump who expends inordinate effort to follow guidelines strictly when
most of society has moved on, but there are also people still
working very hard not to get covid who risk serious consequences if
they were to get sick. [2] I'm not sure how to balance these, and the
decision to come home rather than take on the logistics of isolating
with kids in a far-off hotel was in part a selfish one.  I'm writing
this up not to encourage or discourage similar choices but to walk
through how I was thinking about it and humanize a choice I expect
some of you think was reckless and inconsiderate.

</p>

<p>
<br />

[1] There was nothing that required us to test here.  If you'd told me
in advance "if you get a positive you must isolate in place, but you
can choose not to test" I likely would have chosen to wait to test
until we were home, taking the same precautions described above until
then.

</p>

<p>

[2] A rough calculation on the risk to others: imagine the person
right in front of us on the plane is high risk, perhaps due to age,
and really needs to not get sick.  They're boosted and wearing an N95
to reduce their risk, but they're also three feet from someone with
covid for five hours.  How likely are we to get them sick?  Using
numbers from <a href="https://www.microcovid.org/?distance=normal&amp;duration=360&amp;interaction=oneTime&amp;personCount=1&amp;riskProfile=hasCovid&amp;scenarioName=planeRide&amp;setting=plane&amp;subLocation=US_25017&amp;theirMask=n95&amp;topLocation=US_25&amp;voice=silent&amp;yourMask=n95&amp;yourVaccineDoses=3&amp;yourVaccineType=pfizer">microcovid</a>
(which is generally <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/microcovid-becoming-less-useful">much
less useful</a> than it was, but the best we have) I get that the
risk of them catching covid is about 0.04% (390 microcovids).
