Naturally, Microsoft will encourage you to buy Windows 11 licenses instead. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The alternative for those wishing to buy a Windows 10 license will be to turn instead to third-party retailers. OEM copies of Windows 10 are still available at Amazon, although the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Builder-Wind%D0%BEws-Intended-Upgradable/dp/B00ZSI7Y3U/ref=sr_1_9&amp;xcust=2-1-1477078-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Windows 10 product listing</a> lacks any indication that Microsoft itself will soon stop selling Windows 10 licenses.

Yep, that&rsquo;s what you want torrents for, and if there&rsquo;s one thing you need when torrenting free and open source software, it&rsquo;s a secure and private internet connection. Seriously though, besides privacy, you also need to consider speed, and whether a VPN has torrent-friendly servers and services. We go in to more detail on <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/feed#what-to-look-for-in-a-vpn-for-torrenting\">what to look for in a VPN for torrenting</a> below our picks.

We test on three different days taking the average speeds we find in five different countries (each country is tested three times per day). Then we take all those daily averages to get an overall global average in megabytes per second. Then we compare that to the base speed without a VPN, and then express the result as a percentage how much of the base speed the global average maintains. If there are particularly standout speeds in a certain country or region we will generally call those out too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason we don&rsquo;t quote specific speeds is that these can vary by all kinds of factors such as your location, ISP, home network load and equipment, and so on. The percentages, however, give you a generally good idea of how much of a dip to expect when you connect to a VPN&mdash;there&rsquo;s always a dip. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One other factor torrent users will want to know about is that we read the privacy policy for each and every VPN we cover. Yes, it is painful. The reason we do that is a VPN may promise up front that it doesn&rsquo;t track your web browsing, but then you find that actually it does log IP addresses, timestamps, and bandwidth used. So we dig into the details so you can know exactly what the VPNs we review promise. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that knowledge, however, you can be sure you&rsquo;re getting good value for your money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most VPNs will likely be fine for torrents, but if you want the best of the best, these are our recommendations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-pick-a-vpn-for-torrenting\">How to pick a VPN for torrenting</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few hard-and-fast rules you need from a VPN when downloading torrents. Here&rsquo;s what to look for:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"blocking\">Blocking</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all you want a VPN service provider that allows torrenting on their network. Most do, but there are a few notable exceptions such as Tunnel Bear, which actively blocks torrents. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there are VPNs that partially block torrents, especially on U.S. servers such as TorGuard. This VPN service recently settled a lawsuit brought against it by a consortium of Hollywood production companies after users of TorGuard were found torrenting files that <em>weren&rsquo;t</em> free and open source software. As a result, TorGuard promised to no longer allow torrents on its U.S. servers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>TorGuard isn&rsquo;t the only company that refuses torrents on its U.S. servers. Keep Solid recently promised to block torrents and piracy sites like The Pirate Bay, YTS, and RARBG on the U.S. servers of its service VPN Unlimited. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A number of other VPN services are also involved in pending legal action, including ExpressVPN and ZenMate, as reported by <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://torrentfreak.com/torguard-settles-piracy-lawsuit-and-agrees-to-block-torrent-traffic-on-u-s-servers-220314/&amp;xcust=2-2-624123-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">TorrentFreak</a>. On top of that, many other VPN services don&rsquo;t want to end up in a lawsuit like their competitors and actively disallow torrenting on their American servers. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"service-location\">Service location</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For that reason, we recommend using VPN services that are based outside the U.S., and from those VPNs you should use servers based in countries that are friendlier to torrents. This avoids the issue of dealing with torrents being blocked outright when all you want to do is load up Ubuntu on that new laptop. Most VPN services will specify which servers allow torrents, but a popular and easy choice is Sweden. The speeds are usually good, and most services include Swedish servers in their networks along with many other countries that are torrent-friendly. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"no-logs-policy\">No-logs policy</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing you want is a VPN that has an ironclad no-logs promise from the service provider, because nobody wants to be exposed downloading free and open source software. That means that the service should include a promise not to maintain logs of any kind, with everything going to /dev/null&mdash;a non-existent directory on Linux systems that means all logs are permanently lost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We say &ldquo;promise&rdquo; since there&rsquo;s no real way to know for sure that a VPN isn&rsquo;t logging your activity. You ultimately have to trust that they&rsquo;re not doing it. This trust can come from a few factors, in order of reputability: The company&rsquo;s no-logs promise has been proven by a court challenge, numerous third-party audits have verified the service&rsquo;s claims, or you might just take the company at its word&mdash;yikes. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"speed\">Speed</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, after those details have been verified, you want a VPN with solid speeds. Torrents can take a long time to download as it is, depending on how many people are sharing the file. The last thing you want is to see your download slowed down by shoddy VPN speeds. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get the VPN you need for torrenting, just put all those attributes together: allows torrents, absolute no-logs promise, torrent-friendly services and servers outside the U.S., and excellent speeds.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-block faq-block\"><h2 class=\"faq-block-title\" id=\"faq\"> FAQ </h2><hr class=\"block-horizotal-divider\" />\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">1.</span>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-a-vpn\">What is a VPN?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>A VPN (virtual private network) encrypts your internet traffic and disguises your identity while browsing the internet.

These remote servers can be in your own country or located in different countries around the world. All of your network traffic from your computer to the VPN is sent over a secure and encrypted connection.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When connected to a VPN while browsing the internet, the VPN acts as a middleman between your computer and a website. Your computer sends a request to the VPN, which then passes it on to a website. The website then sends its response back to the VPN which forwards it through the secure connection to your computer. All of the traffic rerouted through the VPN shows as coming through their server rather than your own computer. This keeps your ISP and other third parties from snooping on your internet activity.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">3.</span>\n<h3 id=\"are-vpns-legal-to-use\">Are VPNs legal to use?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>Yes! In most countries, including the United States, using a VPN is perfectly legal. Even though some websites might try to block VPN connections, they are still okay to use. Please note, while using a VPN is legal, some of the activities done <em>while using</em> a VPN might be illegal. Activities such as downloading pirated copyrighted content or accessing dark web markets are both illegal with or without a VPN.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">4.</span>\n<h3 id=\"is-torrenting-through-a-vpn-safe\">Is Torrenting through a VPN safe?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>Safety while torrenting comes down to two things: anonymity and protection from malware or other malicious files.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As far as anonymity goes, yes, you will be protected from any snooping outsiders or your own ISP&rsquo;s restrictions on file torrenting by using a VPN. If you know and trust the P2P network you are using, torrenting with a VPN should be completely safe from prying eyes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In regards to protection from malware and other malicious files, no. A VPN on its own will not protect you from accidentally downloading malicious files from P2P networks or torrent sites. For this, it is highly recommended that you use <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407277/best-antivirus-for-windows-pc.html\">an antivirus program</a> to help keep you safe.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">5.</span>\n<h3 id=\"do-vpns-track-my-browsing-or-store-my-data\">Do VPNs track my browsing or store my data?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>This depends entirely on the VPN provider you choose to use. There have been instances in the past of VPN providers spying on their users or collecting data. However, these were mainly free VPN services with no explicit no-logging policies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When searching for a VPN, be careful to check the company&rsquo;s website for a no-logging policy, third-party trust verification, and trustworthy user reviews. That being said, most of the major paid VPNs have clearly stated no-logging policies so it is typically best to stick with one of them.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">6.</span>\n<h3 id=\"how-many-servers-should-my-vpn-have\">How many servers should my VPN have?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>There isn&rsquo;t a specific number of servers that make one VPN better than another. It&rsquo;s common for VPN providers to advertise the number of servers they have, but this is largely a marketing gimmick and doesn&rsquo;t necessarily equate to the quality of the VPN service itself. Other factors such as server-location spread and server quality are just as important if not more so than the number of available servers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, most popular VPN providers offer between 3,000 to 5,000 servers. We recommend that you avoid any premium service with less than 1,000 servers as this could be an indication that the company is not yet well established, which could portend reliability issues.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n\nVPN</div>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1476932/is-airjets-solid-state-cooling-the-future-of-pc-thermals.html", "title": "AirJet\u2019s solid-state cooling could radically improve tomorrow\u2019s laptops", "date_published": "2023-01-18 18:29:36+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>For a long, long time, PCs have been chasing the idea of &ldquo;no moving parts&rdquo; as a platonic ideal for efficiency and reliability. And for just as long, active cooling has been an impediment to this goal: for high-powered electronics, you just can&rsquo;t beat a fan and moving air for cooling stuff down. Or can you? Frore Systems&rsquo; AirJet is <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1388332/new-airjet-chips-can-double-a-laptops-performance.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a radical solid-state approach to active cooling</a>, and Gordon has the scoop at CES 2023. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frore&rsquo;s founder and CEO Seshu Madhavapeddy was kind enough to give PCWorld the low-down on this emerging tech, which has the potential to upend the way high-powered laptops are built. The &ldquo;magic&rdquo; of AirJet is a combination of exotic materials, geometry, and physics: the 2.8mm chip has cavities in the top full of vibrating membranes, which blast cool air across the heat spreader underneath, cooling down a CPU or other component. Despite the miniscule dimensions, the AirJet can send individual air particles whooshing over the heat spreader at up to 200 kilometers per hour. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems impossible, but the results speak for themselves. AirJet&rsquo;s CES demonstration showed its &ldquo;Mini&rdquo; chip pushing air across a conventional fan and pushing up a ping-pong ball in a way that can&rsquo;t be denied, and indeed, can replicate the cooling power of old-fashioned spinning blades. In fact, the back pressure &mdash; the amount of force created by the moving air &mdash; generated by the AirJet is equal to a fan more than ten times its size. The AirJet is also silent and potentially dust-proof. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The potential here is enormous. One of the biggest limiting factors in the performance of thin laptops is the thermal profile: you simply can&rsquo;t shove a desktop-class chip into a laptop and run it at full performance without making it thick as a brick (or setting it on fire). But with solid-state cooling at a fraction of the size of even the most advanced conventional active cooling systems, those limitations start to disappear. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Madhavapeddy, two 1-watt AirJet units can account for 5 watts of cooling. Thus it could double the thermal limit of a fanless thin-and-light, from 10 watts to 20 watts with one larger &ldquo;Pro&rdquo; unit. The system has been scaled at up to 28 watts in a silent, fanless laptop. For integration with more conventional designs, the AirJet can also be installed with a vapor chamber to put it to the side of a processor instead of directly on top. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>AirJet expects the first devices with its cooling systems to debut by the end of the year.

You might see a confirmation message for the action, but that was it&mdash;and that system worked perfectly for login info from your password manager.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But apparently that behavior wasn&rsquo;t satisfactory. Now when you grab a bit of text, a bubble that displays the string pops up in the lower left of the screen&hellip;and all text is fair game. This includes passwords (yikes!).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What happened? In Android 13, app developers must mark copied text as sensitive to keep it private. Without that signal, the operating system assumes that it&rsquo;s plain text, fit for the eyes to see (and edit, if you tap on the bubble). Some password managers have yet to revise their mobile apps to accommodate this change, which can undermine the security you&rsquo;re hoping to preserve.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not everyone will have this issue&mdash;if you&rsquo;re on a non-stock version of Android (like on a Samsung device), your phone may behave differently. But if you do run into it, it can be aggravating, particularly on Pixel phones. Stock Android 13 doesn&rsquo;t allow users to disable this new feature, a move simultaneously infuriating as it is perplexing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, you&rsquo;re not stuck with your passwords showing whenever you copy one for use. You have two options to restore your security and both are simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"option-1-give-your-password-manager-app-autofill-permissions\">Option 1: Give your password manager app autofill permissions</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage center\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"Google Android 13 Autofill service option menu\" class=\"wp-image-1471890\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot_20230112-154346.png?w=554\" width=\"277\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>To enable this feature, open your Settings app, then search for &ldquo;autofill.&rdquo; Select <em>Autofill service</em>, then tap the current selection. Choose your password manager from your options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now when you create or enter a password, the ability to autofill from your password manager will pop up when in the relevant form field.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"option-2-update-your-password-manager\">Option 2: Update your password manager</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage center\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"Android 13 Google Play app - Update menu\" class=\"wp-image-1471891\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot_20230112-155047.png?w=554\" width=\"277\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&rsquo;t feel comfortable linking your password manager app to Android&rsquo;s autofill feature? A newer version of your password manager may properly mark your passwords as sensitive data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the Google Play app, tap your avatar icon in the upper right of the screen, then choose <em>Manage apps &amp; device</em>. If an update is available, it would be listed under the entry for <em>Updates available</em>. (If you don&rsquo;t have any updates at all, the menu will say <em>All apps up to date</em>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the app has no updates or the latest update doesn&rsquo;t resolve this copying issue, check if the app developer has moved on to a separate version of the app. For example, 1Password made its version 7 and version 8 two completely different apps. Only the newer version keeps your passwords private when copied. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should neither of these options work, you have two alternatives. One is reconsidering autofill. The other is to <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407092/best-password-managers-reviews-and-buying-advice.html\">change password managers</a>. (Yep.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, this feature wouldn&rsquo;t be an issue if all users could just turn it off. I personally get little utility out of it&mdash;if I need to see or edit my text, I&rsquo;m on a PC.</p>\n\nAndroid</div>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1476762/get-microsoft-365-plus-1tb-of-storage-for-just.html", "title": "Get a year of Microsoft 365 and AVG Ultimate antivirus for $40", "date_published": "2023-01-18 16:13:19+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re looking to load up your PC with antivirus software and Microsoft&rsquo;s must-have Office apps&mdash;and who isn&rsquo;t?&mdash;then you&rsquo;re in luck today.

The European Parliament, the EU&rsquo;s representative legislative body, has called upon the European Commission to address a series of issues affecting the game industry and players in general. These include exploitative loot boxes, online gambling, subscriptions, and various protections (or lack thereof) for minors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/european-parliament-votes-to-take-action-against-loot-boxes-gaming-addiction-gold-farming-and-more#:~:text=News-,European%20Parliament%20votes%20to%20take%20action%20against%20loot%20boxes,addiction%2C%20gold%20farming%20and%20more&amp;text=The%20European%20Parliament%20voted%20today,protect%20consumers%2C%20especially%20young%20people.&amp;xcust=2-3-1476642-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">According to GamesIndustry.biz</a>, the report charges the Commission to address a long series of issues, including the possibility of expanding the law to more closely regulate loot boxes. It doubles down on loot boxes, subscriptions, and auto-renewals targeted specifically at minors, as well as opening up the possibility to enshrine the industry&rsquo;s self-regulating PEGI system (the EU&rsquo;s equivalent of ESRB game ratings) in European law. New labels for PEGI ratings might include in-game purchases and advertising alerts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The recommendations are broadly consumer-focused, with the Commission also tasked to gather data on average time and money spent on games, &ldquo;socio-psychological effects,&rdquo; and the possibility of regulating online games targeted at children. (<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gXlauRB1EQ&amp;xcust=2-3-1476642-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Recent attention on games like <em>Roblox</em></a><em> </em>should be mentioned at this point.) The report goes so far as to address &ldquo;gold farming in connection with financial crimes and human rights abuses.&rdquo; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While no recommendations for specific legislation are put forth in the report beyond the PEGI system, the data and research it calls for might result in just that. Pushback from game industry trade groups is a good indication that publishers and developers are taking it seriously, and bristling at the possibility of restrictions on monetization strategies and games aimed at children. Any wide-reaching laws in the European Union are likely to cause changes in the global gaming market, as publishers design around any specific limitations in larger releases. <br /><br />Loot boxes are <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407482/loot-boxes-ruining-gaming.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a bit of an older issue</a> at this point &mdash; as ever, the law moves slower than the technology it regulates.

Countries like Belgium and the Netherlands have already made progress in regulating the more gambling-style elements of loot boxes, resulting in games like <em>Overwatch </em>switching to a more straightforward battle pass &mdash; <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1359589/why-i-quit-overwatch-2-breakup-letter.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">for better or worse</a>. </p>\n\nGaming</div>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1476737/microsoft-axes-10000-jobs-to-cut-costs.html", "title": "Microsoft is laying off 10,000 employees", "date_published": "2023-01-18 15:32:27+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Times are hard in the computer industry, as a pandemic boom transitions into a lull in hardware sales.

Some might argue Apple couldn&rsquo;t since it doesn&rsquo;t have access to AMD&rsquo;s, Intel&rsquo;s and Nvidia&rsquo;s latest mobile hardware to compare the M2 Pro and M2 Max against. The thing is, that&rsquo;s never stopped any company from flexing before. Most of the time (and it&rsquo;s not just Apple that&rsquo;s guilty of this), they just bruise up their competitor&rsquo;s older chips.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"color: initial;\">I&rsquo;d argue, however, that Apple knows 2023 laptops won&rsquo;t be pushovers like those previous years. After all, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1447954/best-of-ces-2023-the-most-intriguing-and-innovative-pc-hardware.html\">CES 2023 saw AMD, Intel, and Nvidia</a> all launch new rounds of hardware, from 16- and 24-core CPUs to a GeForce RTX 4090 Laptop GPU</span> and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, the GeForce RTX 4090 Laptop GPU is really a stepped-down <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1379747/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-tested-5-things.html\">GeForce RTX 4080 desktop GPU</a> in many ways, but with <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html#toc-5\">DLSS 3 Frame Generation</a>, a new architecture, and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1375901/tested-nvidias-geforce-rtx-4090-is-a-content-creation-monster.html\">new AV1 dual-encoder media engine</a>, it&rsquo;s likely going to be a step over previous GeForce laptop GPUs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As far as AMD goes, I have no hard performance numbers from its new &ldquo;Dragon Range&rdquo; Ryzen 9 7045HX, the 16-core laptop CPU designed to compete with Intel&rsquo;s new 24-core 13th-gen laptop chips. But given <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1074246/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-review.html\">AMD&rsquo;s impressively efficient Zen 4 desktop chips</a>, the expectation is it will scream.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More importantly, I was able to test <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1450018/we-have-the-first-core-i9-13980hx-benchmarks-courtesy-of-msi.html\">Intel&rsquo;s ferocious new Core i9-13980X mobile flagship</a> with on a pre-production MSI GT77 Titan at CES to get some firm data on the next generation of PC chips.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The score was a hefty 32,930 in Cinebench R23. Macworld&rsquo;s official score for the MacBook Pro 16 with the M1 Max is 11,765, which was already almost half the score of the older Intel Core i7-12800HX that we recorded <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/707684/tested-intels-desktop-based-core-i7-12800hx-cpu-is-no-joke.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here </a>at 20,480. Apple says the new M2 Pro is up to 20 percent faster than the M1 Pro in multi-threaded performance, but didn&rsquo;t make comparable claims about the M2 Max&rsquo;s uplift.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Apple performance claim chart\" class=\"wp-image-1475777\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Apple-M1-Ultra-gpu-performance-01.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Apple got accused of misleading consumers with its claims on the M1 Ultra launch.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"but-heres-the-thing-it-just-doesnt-matter\">But here&rsquo;s the thing: It just doesn&rsquo;t matter</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Easy win for PC vendors this year? Not so fast. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, I can say with an extremely high degree of probability that Intel&rsquo;s 13th-gen Core chips, AMD&rsquo;s Ryzen 7000-series, and Nvidia&rsquo;s GeForce RTX 4090 Laptop GPU will make quick work of the M2 Pro and M2 Max in gaming, most thread-heavy tasks, and many other tasks where an AMD, Intel or Nvidia chip are favored. For example, I&rsquo;m pretty certain anything that uses <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/827992/tested-intel-arc-av1-video-encoder-vs-nvidia-amd.html\">next-generation AV1 encoding</a> will favor Nvidia, AMD, and Intel GPUs because, well, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1475533/m2-pro-max-processors-cpu-gpu-memory-video-encode-av1.html\">Apple&rsquo;s M2 CPUs sadly lack AV1 hardware encoding</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&rsquo;d also bet there will be plenty of tasks&mdash;such as some video editing chores, some audio editing, and other application-specific workloads&mdash;where Apple&rsquo;s architecture is favored by the software. That&rsquo;s when the new M2 Max and M2 Pro will unleash pain on PC hardware. Apple may continue to have a decent advantage in power efficiency in certain tasks too. But again: It just doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After two years of the usual PC vs. Mac arguing, it&rsquo;s clear that Apple is going further and further down its own path. Comparisons between the two, while fun (when you&rsquo;re winning), are becoming far less useful. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Razer Blade laptops\" class=\"wp-image-1468240\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/DSCF2742_PCW.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>Razer&rsquo;s new Blade laptops are thin, sleek, and powered by fierce hardware like Nvidia&rsquo;s new GeForce RTX 4090. Watch out, Apple.</p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Adam Patrick Murray</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than get into Twitter arguments about X-mark vs. Y-bench, would-be buyers should instead take two steps back simply consume all of the benchmarketing from the companies, read and watch testing results from independent reviewers, and then apply what matters to <em>what you do</em> with your computer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wow, Final Cut Pro ingest of 10-bit, 12K BRAW on the MacBook Pro 16 with M2 Max is awesome! Intel Core i9-13980HX with a GeForce RTX 4090 Laptop GPU will easily max out 360Hz screens in even AAA games! Neither matters if that&rsquo;s not remotely close to how you use your computer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yes, if the MacBook Pro&rsquo;s M2 Pro outpaces Intel&rsquo;s and AMD&rsquo;s new CPUs in Cinebench (again, that&rsquo;s deeply unlikely to happen) you really shouldn&rsquo;t whoop it up. That&rsquo;s what the companies want you to do: To get emotionally involved and worked up so you drop your credit card on the table once again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just buy the hardware and software that best works for you and drive on. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Further reading</strong>: <em><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1448388/10-best-laptops-from-ces-2023.html\">The 10 best laptops from CES 2023</a></em></p></blockquote>\n\nCPUs and Processors</div>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1472897/5-laptops-im-dying-to-try-in-2023.html", "title": "5 boundary-pushing laptops I\u2019m dying to get my hands on in 2023", "date_published": "2023-01-18 11:45:00+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s nothing more exciting to me than a laptop with unique features or an out-of-the-box design.

Personally, I use one for writing and editing as well as web browsing and watching YouTube. However, as the years march on, Chromebooks are evolving and becoming more than just basic everyday machines. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1448341/1448341.html\">Asus Chromebook Vibe CX43 Flip</a>. It&rsquo;s a cloud-based gaming Chromebook with an RGB keyboard. Initially, I was drawn to the all-white chassis and the orange WASD keys. It definitely <em>looks</em> like a gaming laptop, but with a more elevated style. The screen even swings around 360-degrees, which means you can use it like a tablet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The top-tier configuration rocks an Intel Core i7-1255U CPU, Intel Iris Xe graphics, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of PCIe NVMe SSD storage. I haven&rsquo;t tested this one yet, but given the hardware, I suspect it&rsquo;ll deliver peppy performance (though such a sizable SSD might not be needed in a notebook focused on <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/823826/best-cloud-gaming-services.html\">cloud gaming</a>). The 14-inch 1200p display has an aspect ratio of 16:10 and is touch-enabled. The taller 16:10 aspect ratio is perfect for scrolling through documents and such. Plus, Asus even includes a pen in the package.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No word on pricing yet, but the Vibe CX43 will be available to buy in the first quarter of 2023. To sweeten the pot even further, the manufacturer is also bundling a SteelSeries Rival 3 gaming mouse with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"hp-dragonfly-pro-chromebook\">HP Dragonfly Pro Chromebook</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img alt=\"HP Dragonfly Pro Chromebook\" class=\"wp-image-1448051\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Untitled-design-8-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">HP</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>HP&rsquo;s Elite Dragonfly line of laptops are designed with business professionals mind. They&rsquo;re luxurious, lightweight, and expensive. This year at CES the manufacturer unveiled consumer-friendly versions of their business-oriented laptops. That&rsquo;s where the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1447633/hps-new-dragonfly-pro-has-a-tech-support-key-and-its-confusing.html\">HP Dragonfly Pro Chromebook</a> comes in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Dragonfly Pro Chromebook has two standout features: a ridiculously bright display and an RGB keyboard. The RGB keyboard is unique because it&rsquo;s a non-gaming laptop. If you like a bit of flair, then this is good news for you. HP also claims the 14-inch 1600p touchscreen display has a maximum brightness level of 1,200 nits, which is wild. If that number holds true, then this display should produce an incredibly vibrant picture. Inside the chassis, you&rsquo;ll find an Intel Core i5-1235U CPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of SSD storage. That&rsquo;s enough power for day-to-day tasks like checking e-mail, watching Netflix, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"lg-gram-ultraslim\">LG Gram UltraSlim</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"LG Gram UltraSlim laptop\" class=\"wp-image-1446682\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Untitled-design-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1024\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">LG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I couldn&rsquo;t believe what I was seeing when I saw the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1446620/lgs-new-ultrathin-laptop-is-positively-mindblowing.html\">LG Gram UltraSlim</a> from the side. It&rsquo;s practically paper thin. The width is a mind-blowing 0.43-inches and the weight is a jaw-dropping 2.2 pounds. This thing is so lightweight, it may float away if you&rsquo;re not careful. It&rsquo;s also packing some seriously powerful internals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UltraSlim features an Intel Core 13th-gen Raptor Lake chip, Intel Iris Xe graphics, up to 16GB of RAM, and up to 1TB of SSD storage. The luscious OLED display measures a roomy 15.6-inches and has a resolution of 1920&times;1080. That means the picture should be both crisp and vivid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love it when laptop manufacturers push the boundaries of design and that&rsquo;s exactly what LG is doing here. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"lenovo-thinkbook-plus-twist\">Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Twist</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1447301\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ThinkBook-Plus-Twist_02.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Lenovo</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea of an e-ink display on a laptop is positively thrilling to me, as I regularly suffer from eye strain. E-ink displays are commonly found on e-readers and are easier on the eyes. That&rsquo;s why I definitely want to try out the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444648/lenovos-newest-e-ink-laptop-might-be-worth-buying.html\">Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Twist</a>. This unique machine has two displays: one 13.3-inch 1800p OLED touchscreen and one 12-inch e-ink panel. You can switch between the two by spinning the screen, which sits on a 180-degree rotating hinge. The e-ink display is front-lit and is in full color. The hardware is fairly impressive, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ThinkBook Plus Twist features 13th-gen Intel processors, up to 16GB of DDR5 RAM, and 1TB of 4th-gen SSD storage. Based on the specs alone, I expect performance to be zippy, especially during general use tasks. We&rsquo;ll know more when we run a couple of benchmarks on this machine. Personally, I&rsquo;m curious to see whether the e-ink display saves on battery life or not. My personal Kindle has an e-ink display and it lasts quite a while on a single charge. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"lenovo-yogabook-9i\">Lenovo YogaBook 9i</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444656/the-yogabook-9i-packs-a-radical-dual-screen-design.html\">Lenovo YogaBook 9i</a> is as compelling as it is confusing. When the manufacturer first revealed pictures of the laptop, I found myself staring and trying to make sense of it. It&rsquo;s one of the few dual-screen laptops that can stand upright on its own. The two 13-inch OLED displays are connected via a hinge, which allows you to use it in several different 2-in-1 configurations. There&rsquo;s even a detachable keyboard as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This thing is a bizarre sight, that&rsquo;s for sure. It might be a good option for those who need a dual-display workstation, but I suspect this laptop is designed for a more niche crowd. Regardless, it&rsquo;s very interesting and memorable. I&rsquo;d love to see how practical or cumbersome it really is in everyday use. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are the laptops I&rsquo;m most excited to get my hands on, but they&rsquo;re just the tip of the iceberg.

Rather than undercutting more expensive brands by pumping up a few key features then dramatically paring back others, items with Monoprice&rsquo;s label go for a solid but no-frills approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Monoprice DT-3BT firmly upholds that philosophy. At $100, these 50W desktop speakers offer an understated appearance and clear audio, and blend in well with a typical computer desk setup. They also focus more on function, rather than control over audio tuning. You get Bluetooth 5.0 support in addition to TRS and RCA jacks, allowing you to use them with a wide array of devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each speaker measures 5.5 x 8.0 x 5.9 inches (140 x 204 x 150mm) and weighs 3.5 pounds (1.6kg) each. No wood tones here; the all-black coloring is meant to blend into the background. Inside are 3-inch woofer drivers and 0.75-inch tweeter drivers. All the action lives on the primary speaker&mdash;on the front, you&rsquo;ll find a comfortably sized volume knob, along with separate 3.5mm jacks for auxiliary input (e.g., a compatible smartphone or tablet) and headphone output, plus two status lights for power and Bluetooth status. On the back are RCA and 1/4-inch TRS inputs, outputs to connect to the secondary speaker, and buttons for power and Bluetooth pairing.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>Note: Go to our ongoing roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407990/the-best-budget-computer-speakers.html\">best budget computer speakers</a> to learn more about competing products, what to look for in budget computer speakers, and buying recommendations.</em></p></blockquote>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Monoprice DT-3BT speakers - rear view\" class=\"wp-image-1447339\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Monoprice432402.webp\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption>The primary speaker is where you&rsquo;ll manage all of your connections.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Monoprice</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>For setup, you simply connect the primary speaker and your PC using the color-coded RCA-to-3.5mm cable, and then link the primary and secondary speakers using the color-coded speaker interconnect cable. You&rsquo;ll also need to plug the primary speaker into a polarized 2-prong outlet for power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to rivals, the DT-3BT puts more emphasis on higher- and lower-end frequencies&mdash;right in line with Monoprice&rsquo;s other audio products. Some ears will find this sound profile to have a pleasing focus on clarity and crispness, while others may think it&rsquo;s a touch hollow. Either way, you can hear elements in layered music distinctly, when they otherwise get overshadowed or lost with warmer speakers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you can listen to those songs at extremely high volume (though with some distortion), if you so choose. These speakers can easily fill a smaller living room. I usually kept the knob at well below the quarter mark (figuratively speaking) for daytime listening, and cut it even further during later hours. And since you can play from different devices simultaneously, there&rsquo;s no real effort needed to switch between them. You just start playback from the desired piece of gear.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"should-you-buy-the-monoprice-dt-3bt\">Should you buy the Monoprice DT-3BT? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As speakers go, $100 may not seem like much&mdash;audiophiles can easily blow thousands on gear without blinking. But if you&rsquo;re on a budget, that amount can feel like a splurge. The Monoprice DT-3BT&rsquo;s feature set makes it feel worthy of its price tag.
