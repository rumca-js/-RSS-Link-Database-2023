<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in building a Windows 10 PC running Windows 10, you&rsquo;d better hurry &mdash; Microsoft will stop directly selling Windows 10 licenses by the end of the month.</p>



<p>According to notices posted to the Windows 10 Home, Pro, and Workstation pages on Microsoft&rsquo;s site, Microsoft will halt digital downloads of Windows 10 on Jan. 31, 2023. While Microsoft will <em>support </em>Windows 10 for a few more years, Microsoft&rsquo;s decision means that you won&rsquo;t be able to <em>buy</em> a Windows 10 license except through existing stores of licenses at third-party retailers.</p>



<p>&ldquo;January 31, 2023 will be the last day this Windows 10 download is offered for sale. Windows 10 will remain supported with security updates that help protect your PC from viruses, spyware, and other malware until October 14, 2025,&rdquo; <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/windows-10-home/d76qx4bznwk4?activetab=pivot:overviewtab&amp;xcust=2-1-1477078-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Microsoft&rsquo;s Windows 10 Home product page</a> says. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/windows-10-pro/df77x4d43rkt?activetab=pivot:overviewtab&amp;xcust=2-1-1477078-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Windows 10 Pro&rsquo;s product page</a> says the same.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 10 digital download at Microsoft" class="wp-image-1477124" height="526" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Windows-10-product-page.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Better grab an official Windows 10 license while you can.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>The elimination of the Windows 10 license means that Windows 11 will not only be the operating system that Microsoft <em>wants</em> you to buy, it&rsquo;s also the only operating system that Microsoft will <em>allow</em> you you to buy. Naturally, Microsoft will encourage you to buy Windows 11 licenses instead. </p>



<p>The alternative for those wishing to buy a Windows 10 license will be to turn instead to third-party retailers. OEM copies of Windows 10 are still available at Amazon, although the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Builder-Wind%D0%BEws-Intended-Upgradable/dp/B00ZSI7Y3U/ref=sr_1_9&amp;xcust=2-1-1477078-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Windows 10 product listing</a> lacks any indication that Microsoft itself will soon stop selling Windows 10 licenses. Microsoft&rsquo;s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10&amp;xcust=2-1-1477078-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Media Creation Tool for Windows 10</a> also remains in place, for now.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em><strong>Deal alert:</strong>&nbsp;The&nbsp;<a href="https://software.pcworld.com/">PCWorld Software Store</a>&nbsp;frequently sells Windows 10 editions at reduced prices. Make sure to check our&nbsp;<a href="https://software.pcworld.com/p43292-windows_10_home/?x-source=397575">Home</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://software.pcworld.com/p43717-windows_10_professional/?x-source=397575">Pro</a>&nbsp;listings before settling for full price&mdash;at the time of publication, we were selling them for $50 and $70, respectively.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Otherwise, Microsoft&rsquo;s decision means that you&rsquo;ll have to buy a Windows 10 license from a third-party retailer. Fortunately, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/397575/how-to-get-windows-cheap-or-even-for-free.html">PCWorld&rsquo;s guide to buying Windows for cheap</a> still holds valid &mdash; and will become more valuable as time runs out on Windows 10. </p>



<p>The bottom line, though, is this is bad news if you&rsquo;re a system builder or enthusiast, a fan of Windows 10 and someone who doesn&rsquo;t want to upgrade to Windows 11. Soon, you&rsquo;ll have even less choice about which operating system you&rsquo;ll use. </p>

<p>You&rsquo;d think this was the year of the Linux desktop or something given how many people want a VPN for downloading free and open source software through torrents. Yep, that&rsquo;s what you want torrents for, and if there&rsquo;s one thing you need when torrenting free and open source software, it&rsquo;s a secure and private internet connection. Seriously though, besides privacy, you also need to consider speed, and whether a VPN has torrent-friendly servers and services. We go in to more detail on <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/feed#what-to-look-for-in-a-vpn-for-torrenting">what to look for in a VPN for torrenting</a> below our picks. (To learn even more about all the VPN services we&rsquo;ve tested, see our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-apps-reviews-buying-advice.html">roundup of the best VPNs</a> for all sorts of uses.) </p>



<p>So what&rsquo;s the best VPN for torrenting your favorite flavor of Linux and maybe a little Open Office? Here are our top picks.</p>

<p>ProtonVPN has some of the fastest speeds around, both upstream (1st place) and down (2nd place), which is helpful when you want to spread the Open Office love as quickly as possible. It also has excellent privacy promises, and it has a bunch of servers in a friggin&rsquo; bunker, which is pretty cool. ProtonVPN has an excellent interface, it&rsquo;s ownership is well known, it&rsquo;s based in Switzerland, and did we mention the speeds are solid? </p>

<p>While it&rsquo;s not as well known as other services, OVPN is one of the, if not <em>the</em>, earliest pioneers to deploy diskless servers across its network, keeping everything in RAM. (That has since become common among VPN providers.) OVPN is based in Sweden, it makes the right privacy promises, and while it&rsquo;s not in our top 10 for speeds, OVPN&rsquo;s speeds were very good on the whole. It just had a few weak spots, but if you stick to European servers (or North American ones for non-torrent uses) the speeds should be outstanding.</p>

<p>Mullvad is the ultimate VPN when it comes to privacy and anonymity. The Sweden-based company appreciates your business, but it&rsquo;s not interested in finding out who you are. Instead of using an email and password combo, Mullvad randomly generates an account number that functions as your username and password. Mullvad is in the top 10 for speeds, and of course its privacy promises are top notch.</p>

<p>ExpressVPN is our favorite VPN so it&rsquo;s no surprise that it&rsquo;s landing in the top picks for torrents. ExpressVPN makes most of the right privacy promises, and its speeds are very good. It also has a lot of other features beyond being good for torrents that make it worth your while, such as the smart DNS feature. ExpressVPN is officially based in the British Virgin Islands, it has an absolute ton of servers, but it does monitor bandwidth usage to get rid of bandwidth hogs, which might be a problem if you&rsquo;re constantly downloading nightly builds of various Linux distros.</p>

<p>AirVPN is either an excellent VPN for privacy, or the ultimate honey pot to attract online trouble makers, like free and open source software torrenters. The reason we say that is that AirVPN&rsquo;s team is largely anonymous so it&rsquo;s not clear who&rsquo;s running the show. Still, this Italy-based VPN does have a good reputation and its speeds put it in our top 10. Its desktop interface is <em>very </em>bare bones, but it&rsquo;s usable. Its network isn&rsquo;t huge, but it is very economical and works well.  </p>

<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>



<p>If you&rsquo;ve read a number of these VPN articles, you know the drill by now. We test on three different days taking the average speeds we find in five different countries (each country is tested three times per day). Then we take all those daily averages to get an overall global average in megabytes per second. Then we compare that to the base speed without a VPN, and then express the result as a percentage how much of the base speed the global average maintains. If there are particularly standout speeds in a certain country or region we will generally call those out too.</p>



<p>The reason we don&rsquo;t quote specific speeds is that these can vary by all kinds of factors such as your location, ISP, home network load and equipment, and so on. The percentages, however, give you a generally good idea of how much of a dip to expect when you connect to a VPN&mdash;there&rsquo;s always a dip. </p>



<p>One other factor torrent users will want to know about is that we read the privacy policy for each and every VPN we cover. Yes, it is painful. The reason we do that is a VPN may promise up front that it doesn&rsquo;t track your web browsing, but then you find that actually it does log IP addresses, timestamps, and bandwidth used. So we dig into the details so you can know exactly what the VPNs we review promise. </p>



<p>With that knowledge, however, you can be sure you&rsquo;re getting good value for your money.</p>



<p>Most VPNs will likely be fine for torrents, but if you want the best of the best, these are our recommendations.</p>



<h2 id="how-to-pick-a-vpn-for-torrenting">How to pick a VPN for torrenting</h2>



<p>There are a few hard-and-fast rules you need from a VPN when downloading torrents. Here&rsquo;s what to look for:</p>



<h3 id="blocking">Blocking</h3>



<p>First of all you want a VPN service provider that allows torrenting on their network. Most do, but there are a few notable exceptions such as Tunnel Bear, which actively blocks torrents. </p>



<p>Then there are VPNs that partially block torrents, especially on U.S. servers such as TorGuard. This VPN service recently settled a lawsuit brought against it by a consortium of Hollywood production companies after users of TorGuard were found torrenting files that <em>weren&rsquo;t</em> free and open source software. As a result, TorGuard promised to no longer allow torrents on its U.S. servers. </p>



<p>TorGuard isn&rsquo;t the only company that refuses torrents on its U.S. servers. Keep Solid recently promised to block torrents and piracy sites like The Pirate Bay, YTS, and RARBG on the U.S. servers of its service VPN Unlimited. </p>



<p>A number of other VPN services are also involved in pending legal action, including ExpressVPN and ZenMate, as reported by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://torrentfreak.com/torguard-settles-piracy-lawsuit-and-agrees-to-block-torrent-traffic-on-u-s-servers-220314/&amp;xcust=2-2-624123-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">TorrentFreak</a>. On top of that, many other VPN services don&rsquo;t want to end up in a lawsuit like their competitors and actively disallow torrenting on their American servers. </p>



<h3 id="service-location">Service location</h3>



<p>For that reason, we recommend using VPN services that are based outside the U.S., and from those VPNs you should use servers based in countries that are friendlier to torrents. This avoids the issue of dealing with torrents being blocked outright when all you want to do is load up Ubuntu on that new laptop. Most VPN services will specify which servers allow torrents, but a popular and easy choice is Sweden. The speeds are usually good, and most services include Swedish servers in their networks along with many other countries that are torrent-friendly. </p>



<h3 id="no-logs-policy">No-logs policy</h3>



<p>The next thing you want is a VPN that has an ironclad no-logs promise from the service provider, because nobody wants to be exposed downloading free and open source software. That means that the service should include a promise not to maintain logs of any kind, with everything going to /dev/null&mdash;a non-existent directory on Linux systems that means all logs are permanently lost.</p>



<p>We say &ldquo;promise&rdquo; since there&rsquo;s no real way to know for sure that a VPN isn&rsquo;t logging your activity. You ultimately have to trust that they&rsquo;re not doing it. This trust can come from a few factors, in order of reputability: The company&rsquo;s no-logs promise has been proven by a court challenge, numerous third-party audits have verified the service&rsquo;s claims, or you might just take the company at its word&mdash;yikes. </p>



<h3 id="speed">Speed</h3>



<p>Finally, after those details have been verified, you want a VPN with solid speeds. Torrents can take a long time to download as it is, depending on how many people are sharing the file. The last thing you want is to see your download slowed down by shoddy VPN speeds. </p>



<p>To get the VPN you need for torrenting, just put all those attributes together: allows torrents, absolute no-logs promise, torrent-friendly services and servers outside the U.S., and excellent speeds.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>A VPN (virtual private network) encrypts your internet traffic and disguises your identity while browsing the internet. When used for torrenting, a VPN will anonymize your torrenting traffic and keep your ISP from potentially throttling your connection in the future.</p>



<p>Additionally, VPNs allow you to connect to servers all across the world. So if you&rsquo;re looking to access location-restricted content, such as streaming services, you can connect to the appropriate country&rsquo;s server and gain access that way.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-a-vpn-work">How does a VPN work?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>A VPN hides your IP address by redirecting it through a remote server hosted by the VPN company. To anyone looking in, the VPN server then becomes the source of your data instead of your actual location. These remote servers can be in your own country or located in different countries around the world. All of your network traffic from your computer to the VPN is sent over a secure and encrypted connection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When connected to a VPN while browsing the internet, the VPN acts as a middleman between your computer and a website. Your computer sends a request to the VPN, which then passes it on to a website. The website then sends its response back to the VPN which forwards it through the secure connection to your computer. All of the traffic rerouted through the VPN shows as coming through their server rather than your own computer. This keeps your ISP and other third parties from snooping on your internet activity.</p>

<h3 id="are-vpns-legal-to-use">Are VPNs legal to use?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Yes! In most countries, including the United States, using a VPN is perfectly legal. Even though some websites might try to block VPN connections, they are still okay to use. Please note, while using a VPN is legal, some of the activities done <em>while using</em> a VPN might be illegal. Activities such as downloading pirated copyrighted content or accessing dark web markets are both illegal with or without a VPN.</p>

<h3 id="is-torrenting-through-a-vpn-safe">Is Torrenting through a VPN safe?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Safety while torrenting comes down to two things: anonymity and protection from malware or other malicious files.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As far as anonymity goes, yes, you will be protected from any snooping outsiders or your own ISP&rsquo;s restrictions on file torrenting by using a VPN. If you know and trust the P2P network you are using, torrenting with a VPN should be completely safe from prying eyes.</p>



<p>In regards to protection from malware and other malicious files, no. A VPN on its own will not protect you from accidentally downloading malicious files from P2P networks or torrent sites. For this, it is highly recommended that you use <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407277/best-antivirus-for-windows-pc.html">an antivirus program</a> to help keep you safe.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>This depends entirely on the VPN provider you choose to use. There have been instances in the past of VPN providers spying on their users or collecting data. However, these were mainly free VPN services with no explicit no-logging policies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When searching for a VPN, be careful to check the company&rsquo;s website for a no-logging policy, third-party trust verification, and trustworthy user reviews. That being said, most of the major paid VPNs have clearly stated no-logging policies so it is typically best to stick with one of them.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>There isn&rsquo;t a specific number of servers that make one VPN better than another. It&rsquo;s common for VPN providers to advertise the number of servers they have, but this is largely a marketing gimmick and doesn&rsquo;t necessarily equate to the quality of the VPN service itself. Other factors such as server-location spread and server quality are just as important if not more so than the number of available servers.</p>



<p>That being said, most popular VPN providers offer between 3,000 to 5,000 servers. We recommend that you avoid any premium service with less than 1,000 servers as this could be an indication that the company is not yet well established, which could portend reliability issues.</p>

## AirJet’s solid-state cooling could radically improve tomorrow’s laptops

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>For a long, long time, PCs have been chasing the idea of &ldquo;no moving parts&rdquo; as a platonic ideal for efficiency and reliability. And for just as long, active cooling has been an impediment to this goal: for high-powered electronics, you just can&rsquo;t beat a fan and moving air for cooling stuff down. Or can you? Frore Systems&rsquo; AirJet is <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1388332/new-airjet-chips-can-double-a-laptops-performance.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">a radical solid-state approach to active cooling</a>, and Gordon has the scoop at CES 2023. </p>



<p>Frore&rsquo;s founder and CEO Seshu Madhavapeddy was kind enough to give PCWorld the low-down on this emerging tech, which has the potential to upend the way high-powered laptops are built. The &ldquo;magic&rdquo; of AirJet is a combination of exotic materials, geometry, and physics: the 2.8mm chip has cavities in the top full of vibrating membranes, which blast cool air across the heat spreader underneath, cooling down a CPU or other component. Despite the miniscule dimensions, the AirJet can send individual air particles whooshing over the heat spreader at up to 200 kilometers per hour. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>It seems impossible, but the results speak for themselves. AirJet&rsquo;s CES demonstration showed its &ldquo;Mini&rdquo; chip pushing air across a conventional fan and pushing up a ping-pong ball in a way that can&rsquo;t be denied, and indeed, can replicate the cooling power of old-fashioned spinning blades. In fact, the back pressure &mdash; the amount of force created by the moving air &mdash; generated by the AirJet is equal to a fan more than ten times its size. The AirJet is also silent and potentially dust-proof. </p>



<p>The potential here is enormous. One of the biggest limiting factors in the performance of thin laptops is the thermal profile: you simply can&rsquo;t shove a desktop-class chip into a laptop and run it at full performance without making it thick as a brick (or setting it on fire). But with solid-state cooling at a fraction of the size of even the most advanced conventional active cooling systems, those limitations start to disappear. </p>



<p>According to Madhavapeddy, two 1-watt AirJet units can account for 5 watts of cooling. Thus it could double the thermal limit of a fanless thin-and-light, from 10 watts to 20 watts with one larger &ldquo;Pro&rdquo; unit. The system has been scaled at up to 28 watts in a silent, fanless laptop. For integration with more conventional designs, the AirJet can also be installed with a vapor chamber to put it to the side of a processor instead of directly on top. </p>



<p>AirJet expects the first devices with its cooling systems to debut by the end of the year. Check out the video for the full technical breakdown.

## Android 13’s new copy system reveals your passwords. Here’s how to stop it

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Until Android 13&rsquo;s October 2022 release, the text you copied to your phone&rsquo;s clipboard was private. You might see a confirmation message for the action, but that was it&mdash;and that system worked perfectly for login info from your password manager.</p>



<p>But apparently that behavior wasn&rsquo;t satisfactory. Now when you grab a bit of text, a bubble that displays the string pops up in the lower left of the screen&hellip;and all text is fair game. This includes passwords (yikes!).</p>



<p>What happened? In Android 13, app developers must mark copied text as sensitive to keep it private. Without that signal, the operating system assumes that it&rsquo;s plain text, fit for the eyes to see (and edit, if you tap on the bubble). Some password managers have yet to revise their mobile apps to accommodate this change, which can undermine the security you&rsquo;re hoping to preserve.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not everyone will have this issue&mdash;if you&rsquo;re on a non-stock version of Android (like on a Samsung device), your phone may behave differently. But if you do run into it, it can be aggravating, particularly on Pixel phones. Stock Android 13 doesn&rsquo;t allow users to disable this new feature, a move simultaneously infuriating as it is perplexing.</p>



<p>Fortunately, you&rsquo;re not stuck with your passwords showing whenever you copy one for use. You have two options to restore your security and both are simple.</p>



<h2 id="option-1-give-your-password-manager-app-autofill-permissions">Option 1: Give your password manager app autofill permissions</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage center"><figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="Google Android 13 Autofill service option menu" class="wp-image-1471890" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot_20230112-154346.png?w=554" width="277" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>To enable this feature, open your Settings app, then search for &ldquo;autofill.&rdquo; Select <em>Autofill service</em>, then tap the current selection. Choose your password manager from your options.</p>



<p>Now when you create or enter a password, the ability to autofill from your password manager will pop up when in the relevant form field.</p>



<h2 id="option-2-update-your-password-manager">Option 2: Update your password manager</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage center"><figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="Android 13 Google Play app - Update menu" class="wp-image-1471891" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot_20230112-155047.png?w=554" width="277" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>Don&rsquo;t feel comfortable linking your password manager app to Android&rsquo;s autofill feature? A newer version of your password manager may properly mark your passwords as sensitive data.</p>



<p>In the Google Play app, tap your avatar icon in the upper right of the screen, then choose <em>Manage apps &amp; device</em>. If an update is available, it would be listed under the entry for <em>Updates available</em>. (If you don&rsquo;t have any updates at all, the menu will say <em>All apps up to date</em>.)</p>



<p>If the app has no updates or the latest update doesn&rsquo;t resolve this copying issue, check if the app developer has moved on to a separate version of the app. For example, 1Password made its version 7 and version 8 two completely different apps. Only the newer version keeps your passwords private when copied. </p>



<p>Should neither of these options work, you have two alternatives. One is reconsidering autofill. The other is to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407092/best-password-managers-reviews-and-buying-advice.html">change password managers</a>. (Yep.)</p>



<p>Of course, this feature wouldn&rsquo;t be an issue if all users could just turn it off. I personally get little utility out of it&mdash;if I need to see or edit my text, I&rsquo;m on a PC.</p>

<p>Have you looked around at the state of the game industry and wondered, &ldquo;Geez, when did every AAA game turn into a mini-casino?&rdquo; If so, you&rsquo;re not alone. The European Parliament, the EU&rsquo;s representative legislative body, has called upon the European Commission to address a series of issues affecting the game industry and players in general. These include exploitative loot boxes, online gambling, subscriptions, and various protections (or lack thereof) for minors. </p>



<p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/european-parliament-votes-to-take-action-against-loot-boxes-gaming-addiction-gold-farming-and-more#:~:text=News-,European%20Parliament%20votes%20to%20take%20action%20against%20loot%20boxes,addiction%2C%20gold%20farming%20and%20more&amp;text=The%20European%20Parliament%20voted%20today,protect%20consumers%2C%20especially%20young%20people.&amp;xcust=2-3-1476642-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">According to GamesIndustry.biz</a>, the report charges the Commission to address a long series of issues, including the possibility of expanding the law to more closely regulate loot boxes. It doubles down on loot boxes, subscriptions, and auto-renewals targeted specifically at minors, as well as opening up the possibility to enshrine the industry&rsquo;s self-regulating PEGI system (the EU&rsquo;s equivalent of ESRB game ratings) in European law. New labels for PEGI ratings might include in-game purchases and advertising alerts. </p>



<p>The recommendations are broadly consumer-focused, with the Commission also tasked to gather data on average time and money spent on games, &ldquo;socio-psychological effects,&rdquo; and the possibility of regulating online games targeted at children. (<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gXlauRB1EQ&amp;xcust=2-3-1476642-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Recent attention on games like <em>Roblox</em></a><em> </em>should be mentioned at this point.) The report goes so far as to address &ldquo;gold farming in connection with financial crimes and human rights abuses.&rdquo; </p>



<p>While no recommendations for specific legislation are put forth in the report beyond the PEGI system, the data and research it calls for might result in just that. Pushback from game industry trade groups is a good indication that publishers and developers are taking it seriously, and bristling at the possibility of restrictions on monetization strategies and games aimed at children. Any wide-reaching laws in the European Union are likely to cause changes in the global gaming market, as publishers design around any specific limitations in larger releases. <br /><br />Loot boxes are <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407482/loot-boxes-ruining-gaming.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">a bit of an older issue</a> at this point &mdash; as ever, the law moves slower than the technology it regulates. Developers have largely <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398614/battle-passes-are-making-me-play-games-less-not-more.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">moved on to battle pass systems</a> for recurring payments, which swap out randomized rewards with specific grinding goals. Countries like Belgium and the Netherlands have already made progress in regulating the more gambling-style elements of loot boxes, resulting in games like <em>Overwatch </em>switching to a more straightforward battle pass &mdash; <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1359589/why-i-quit-overwatch-2-breakup-letter.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">for better or worse</a>. </p>

<p>Times are hard in the computer industry, as a pandemic boom transitions into a lull in hardware sales. We&rsquo;ve seen layoffs across the board late last year and continuing into 2023, but perhaps the most visible was just announced by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. According to a post on the company&rsquo;s official blog, Microsoft will cut a whopping ten thousand jobs this year. Some employees are being notified of their termination today. </p>



<p>That&rsquo;s a reduction of about 5 percent of Microsoft&rsquo;s total headcount &mdash; small in overall terms, but presumably focused on &ldquo;tightening the belt&rdquo; and reallocating resources to the most profitable parts of the company. That&rsquo;s the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/01/18/subject-focusing-on-our-short-and-long-term-opportunity/&amp;xcust=2-3-1476737-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">impression of the blog post</a>, anyway: we&rsquo;ll spare you such investor-focused terms as &ldquo;secular growth and long-term competitiveness.&rdquo; </p>



<p>According to Nadella, laid-off employees will be notified 60 days in advance and get &ldquo;above-market severance pay,&rdquo; six months of medical benefits and stock options. Those are the requirements for US employees, anyway &mdash; international Microsoft employees will be treated in accordance &ldquo;with the employment laws in each country.&rdquo; </p>



<p>Microsoft follows some of the biggest names in tech in announcing recent layoffs, including Amazon, Meta (Facebook), Cisco, and an especially embattled Twitter. </p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a prediction you can trade in for a long-term certificate of deposit: <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/1475537/m2-pro-max-chips-cpu-gpu-peformance-m1-intel.html">Apple&rsquo;s new M2 Max and M2 Pro chips</a> in its updated MacBook Pro laptops are going to get thrashed by <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444850/amd-launches-mobile-ryzen-7000-cpus-prepping-for-an-ai-future.html">AMD</a>, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1435904/intel-launches-13th-gen-mobile-core-chips-with-endurance-gaming.html">Intel</a>, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1445469/nvidia-unleashes-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-rtx-40-series-laptops-and-more.html">Nvidia&rsquo;s</a> newest silicon in a lot of benchmarks.</p>



<p>How can I say this before reviewers publish independent testing of Apple&rsquo;s new M2 Pro and M2 Max chips? First, based on the language out of Apple itself, which is lacking any attitude whatsoever.</p>



<p>Apple strutted around for the original M1 launch in 2020, when Apple and its fans beat their chests over stunning claims like the M1 being &ldquo;2x faster&rdquo; than comparable PC CPUs.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Apple performance claim chart" class="wp-image-1475778" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Apple_m1-chip-cpu-power-chart_11102020.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Apple claimed the M1 in 2020 outperformed  the &ldquo;latest PC laptop chip&rdquo; by 2X.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Apple</p></div>



<p>A year later, when the M1 Pro and M1 Max were launched and Apple was in full dynasty proclamation mode, we again saw tons of end zone dances and spiking of the ball by Apple, rubbing similar claims in the faces of PC hardware.</p>



<p>And when the M2 Ultra launched just a few months later in early 2022, we saw more celebration as Apple claimed it outperformed 16-core desktop CPUs and even Nvidia&rsquo;s then top-end GeForce RTX 3090. Sure, Apple was<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/17/22982915/apple-m1-ultra-rtx-3090-comparison-specs-charts-cpu-gpu-performance&amp;xcust=2-3-1475775-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> accused by the press</a> of cheating to achieve those results, but the fact Apple wanted to get in Nvidia&rsquo;s grill tells you its confidence in the M1 Ultra prowess.</p>



<p>Contrast those previous launches to the unceremonious M2 Pro and M2 Max launch.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Apple performance claim chart" class="wp-image-1475779" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Apple_M1-Pro-M1-Max_CPU-Performance_10182021.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Apple&rsquo;s 2021 launch of the M1 Pro and M1 max included many comparisons  to PC laptops.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Apple</p></div>



<p>If you even want to call the M2 Pro&rsquo;s reveal a launch that is. There was no livestream or pre-game boasting of performance claims this time. All Apple did was spit out a couple of press releases and call it a day.</p>



<p>In fact, comparable PC silicon was barely mentioned at all. Some might argue Apple couldn&rsquo;t since it doesn&rsquo;t have access to AMD&rsquo;s, Intel&rsquo;s and Nvidia&rsquo;s latest mobile hardware to compare the M2 Pro and M2 Max against. The thing is, that&rsquo;s never stopped any company from flexing before. Most of the time (and it&rsquo;s not just Apple that&rsquo;s guilty of this), they just bruise up their competitor&rsquo;s older chips.</p>



<p><span style="color: initial;">I&rsquo;d argue, however, that Apple knows 2023 laptops won&rsquo;t be pushovers like those previous years. After all, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1447954/best-of-ces-2023-the-most-intriguing-and-innovative-pc-hardware.html">CES 2023 saw AMD, Intel, and Nvidia</a> all launch new rounds of hardware, from 16- and 24-core CPUs to a GeForce RTX 4090 Laptop GPU</span> and more.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Sure, the GeForce RTX 4090 Laptop GPU is really a stepped-down <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1379747/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-tested-5-things.html">GeForce RTX 4080 desktop GPU</a> in many ways, but with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html#toc-5">DLSS 3 Frame Generation</a>, a new architecture, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1375901/tested-nvidias-geforce-rtx-4090-is-a-content-creation-monster.html">new AV1 dual-encoder media engine</a>, it&rsquo;s likely going to be a step over previous GeForce laptop GPUs.</p>



<p>As far as AMD goes, I have no hard performance numbers from its new &ldquo;Dragon Range&rdquo; Ryzen 9 7045HX, the 16-core laptop CPU designed to compete with Intel&rsquo;s new 24-core 13th-gen laptop chips. But given <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1074246/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-review.html">AMD&rsquo;s impressively efficient Zen 4 desktop chips</a>, the expectation is it will scream.</p>



<p>More importantly, I was able to test <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1450018/we-have-the-first-core-i9-13980hx-benchmarks-courtesy-of-msi.html">Intel&rsquo;s ferocious new Core i9-13980X mobile flagship</a> with on a pre-production MSI GT77 Titan at CES to get some firm data on the next generation of PC chips.</p>



<p>The score was a hefty 32,930 in Cinebench R23. Macworld&rsquo;s official score for the MacBook Pro 16 with the M1 Max is 11,765, which was already almost half the score of the older Intel Core i7-12800HX that we recorded <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/707684/tested-intels-desktop-based-core-i7-12800hx-cpu-is-no-joke.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">here </a>at 20,480. Apple says the new M2 Pro is up to 20 percent faster than the M1 Pro in multi-threaded performance, but didn&rsquo;t make comparable claims about the M2 Max&rsquo;s uplift.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Apple performance claim chart" class="wp-image-1475777" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Apple-M1-Ultra-gpu-performance-01.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Apple got accused of misleading consumers with its claims on the M1 Ultra launch.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Apple</p></div>



<h2 id="but-heres-the-thing-it-just-doesnt-matter">But here&rsquo;s the thing: It just doesn&rsquo;t matter</h2>



<p>Easy win for PC vendors this year? Not so fast. </p>



<p>Again, I can say with an extremely high degree of probability that Intel&rsquo;s 13th-gen Core chips, AMD&rsquo;s Ryzen 7000-series, and Nvidia&rsquo;s GeForce RTX 4090 Laptop GPU will make quick work of the M2 Pro and M2 Max in gaming, most thread-heavy tasks, and many other tasks where an AMD, Intel or Nvidia chip are favored. For example, I&rsquo;m pretty certain anything that uses <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/827992/tested-intel-arc-av1-video-encoder-vs-nvidia-amd.html">next-generation AV1 encoding</a> will favor Nvidia, AMD, and Intel GPUs because, well, <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/1475533/m2-pro-max-processors-cpu-gpu-memory-video-encode-av1.html">Apple&rsquo;s M2 CPUs sadly lack AV1 hardware encoding</a>.</p>



<p>I&rsquo;d also bet there will be plenty of tasks&mdash;such as some video editing chores, some audio editing, and other application-specific workloads&mdash;where Apple&rsquo;s architecture is favored by the software. That&rsquo;s when the new M2 Max and M2 Pro will unleash pain on PC hardware. Apple may continue to have a decent advantage in power efficiency in certain tasks too. But again: It just doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>



<p>After two years of the usual PC vs. Mac arguing, it&rsquo;s clear that Apple is going further and further down its own path. Comparisons between the two, while fun (when you&rsquo;re winning), are becoming far less useful. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Razer Blade laptops" class="wp-image-1468240" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/DSCF2742_PCW.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Razer&rsquo;s new Blade laptops are thin, sleek, and powered by fierce hardware like Nvidia&rsquo;s new GeForce RTX 4090. Watch out, Apple.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Adam Patrick Murray</p></div>



<p>Rather than get into Twitter arguments about X-mark vs. Y-bench, would-be buyers should instead take two steps back simply consume all of the benchmarketing from the companies, read and watch testing results from independent reviewers, and then apply what matters to <em>what you do</em> with your computer.</p>



<p>Wow, Final Cut Pro ingest of 10-bit, 12K BRAW on the MacBook Pro 16 with M2 Max is awesome! Intel Core i9-13980HX with a GeForce RTX 4090 Laptop GPU will easily max out 360Hz screens in even AAA games! Neither matters if that&rsquo;s not remotely close to how you use your computer.</p>



<p>So yes, if the MacBook Pro&rsquo;s M2 Pro outpaces Intel&rsquo;s and AMD&rsquo;s new CPUs in Cinebench (again, that&rsquo;s deeply unlikely to happen) you really shouldn&rsquo;t whoop it up. That&rsquo;s what the companies want you to do: To get emotionally involved and worked up so you drop your credit card on the table once again.</p>



<p>Just buy the hardware and software that best works for you and drive on. </p>

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>There&rsquo;s nothing more exciting to me than a laptop with unique features or an out-of-the-box design. While a slew of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1448388/10-best-laptops-from-ces-2023.html">brand spanking new laptops were announced at CES</a> this year, there were some that really stood out from the rest. From RGB keyboards on Chromebooks to portable laptops so thin and lightweight they practically float away, I&rsquo;m dying to try each and every one of them. Let&rsquo;s get into then, shall we?</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Looking for more laptop options? Check out our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/436674/the-best-pc-laptops-of-the-year.html">best laptops</a> available today</em>.</p></blockquote>



<h2 id="asus-chromebook-vibe-cx43-flip">Asus Chromebook Vibe CX43 Flip</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img alt="Asus Chromebook Vibe CX34 Flip" class="wp-image-1448349" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Untitled-design-8-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Asus</p></div>



<p>Chromebooks are great for those who want a no-frills machine. Personally, I use one for writing and editing as well as web browsing and watching YouTube. However, as the years march on, Chromebooks are evolving and becoming more than just basic everyday machines. </p>



<p>Enter the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1448341/1448341.html">Asus Chromebook Vibe CX43 Flip</a>. It&rsquo;s a cloud-based gaming Chromebook with an RGB keyboard. Initially, I was drawn to the all-white chassis and the orange WASD keys. It definitely <em>looks</em> like a gaming laptop, but with a more elevated style. The screen even swings around 360-degrees, which means you can use it like a tablet. </p>



<p>The top-tier configuration rocks an Intel Core i7-1255U CPU, Intel Iris Xe graphics, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of PCIe NVMe SSD storage. I haven&rsquo;t tested this one yet, but given the hardware, I suspect it&rsquo;ll deliver peppy performance (though such a sizable SSD might not be needed in a notebook focused on <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/823826/best-cloud-gaming-services.html">cloud gaming</a>). The 14-inch 1200p display has an aspect ratio of 16:10 and is touch-enabled. The taller 16:10 aspect ratio is perfect for scrolling through documents and such. Plus, Asus even includes a pen in the package.</p>



<p>No word on pricing yet, but the Vibe CX43 will be available to buy in the first quarter of 2023. To sweeten the pot even further, the manufacturer is also bundling a SteelSeries Rival 3 gaming mouse with it.</p>



<h2 id="hp-dragonfly-pro-chromebook">HP Dragonfly Pro Chromebook</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img alt="HP Dragonfly Pro Chromebook" class="wp-image-1448051" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Untitled-design-8-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">HP</p></div>



<p>HP&rsquo;s Elite Dragonfly line of laptops are designed with business professionals mind. They&rsquo;re luxurious, lightweight, and expensive. This year at CES the manufacturer unveiled consumer-friendly versions of their business-oriented laptops. That&rsquo;s where the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1447633/hps-new-dragonfly-pro-has-a-tech-support-key-and-its-confusing.html">HP Dragonfly Pro Chromebook</a> comes in.</p>



<p>The Dragonfly Pro Chromebook has two standout features: a ridiculously bright display and an RGB keyboard. The RGB keyboard is unique because it&rsquo;s a non-gaming laptop. If you like a bit of flair, then this is good news for you. HP also claims the 14-inch 1600p touchscreen display has a maximum brightness level of 1,200 nits, which is wild. If that number holds true, then this display should produce an incredibly vibrant picture. Inside the chassis, you&rsquo;ll find an Intel Core i5-1235U CPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of SSD storage. That&rsquo;s enough power for day-to-day tasks like checking e-mail, watching Netflix, and so on.</p>



<h2 id="lg-gram-ultraslim">LG Gram UltraSlim</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="LG Gram UltraSlim laptop" class="wp-image-1446682" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Untitled-design-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">LG</p></div>



<p>I couldn&rsquo;t believe what I was seeing when I saw the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1446620/lgs-new-ultrathin-laptop-is-positively-mindblowing.html">LG Gram UltraSlim</a> from the side. It&rsquo;s practically paper thin. The width is a mind-blowing 0.43-inches and the weight is a jaw-dropping 2.2 pounds. This thing is so lightweight, it may float away if you&rsquo;re not careful. It&rsquo;s also packing some seriously powerful internals.</p>



<p>The UltraSlim features an Intel Core 13th-gen Raptor Lake chip, Intel Iris Xe graphics, up to 16GB of RAM, and up to 1TB of SSD storage. The luscious OLED display measures a roomy 15.6-inches and has a resolution of 1920&times;1080. That means the picture should be both crisp and vivid.</p>



<p>I love it when laptop manufacturers push the boundaries of design and that&rsquo;s exactly what LG is doing here. </p>



<h2 id="lenovo-thinkbook-plus-twist">Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Twist</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1447301" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ThinkBook-Plus-Twist_02.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Lenovo</p></div>



<p>The idea of an e-ink display on a laptop is positively thrilling to me, as I regularly suffer from eye strain. E-ink displays are commonly found on e-readers and are easier on the eyes. That&rsquo;s why I definitely want to try out the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444648/lenovos-newest-e-ink-laptop-might-be-worth-buying.html">Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Twist</a>. This unique machine has two displays: one 13.3-inch 1800p OLED touchscreen and one 12-inch e-ink panel. You can switch between the two by spinning the screen, which sits on a 180-degree rotating hinge. The e-ink display is front-lit and is in full color. The hardware is fairly impressive, too.</p>



<p>The ThinkBook Plus Twist features 13th-gen Intel processors, up to 16GB of DDR5 RAM, and 1TB of 4th-gen SSD storage. Based on the specs alone, I expect performance to be zippy, especially during general use tasks. We&rsquo;ll know more when we run a couple of benchmarks on this machine. Personally, I&rsquo;m curious to see whether the e-ink display saves on battery life or not. My personal Kindle has an e-ink display and it lasts quite a while on a single charge. </p>



<h2 id="lenovo-yogabook-9i">Lenovo YogaBook 9i</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444656/the-yogabook-9i-packs-a-radical-dual-screen-design.html">Lenovo YogaBook 9i</a> is as compelling as it is confusing. When the manufacturer first revealed pictures of the laptop, I found myself staring and trying to make sense of it. It&rsquo;s one of the few dual-screen laptops that can stand upright on its own. The two 13-inch OLED displays are connected via a hinge, which allows you to use it in several different 2-in-1 configurations. There&rsquo;s even a detachable keyboard as well. </p>



<p>This thing is a bizarre sight, that&rsquo;s for sure. It might be a good option for those who need a dual-display workstation, but I suspect this laptop is designed for a more niche crowd. Regardless, it&rsquo;s very interesting and memorable. I&rsquo;d love to see how practical or cumbersome it really is in everyday use. </p>



<p>These are the laptops I&rsquo;m most excited to get my hands on, but they&rsquo;re just the tip of the iceberg. For an even deeper look at the nifty notebooks coming down the pipe, be sure to check out our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1448388/10-best-laptops-from-ces-2023.html">10 best laptops of CES 2023</a>.</p>

<p>Monoprice may not be a household name, but for decades it has quietly sold tech gear that rivals brand-name goods in quality&mdash;in a fashion. Rather than undercutting more expensive brands by pumping up a few key features then dramatically paring back others, items with Monoprice&rsquo;s label go for a solid but no-frills approach.</p>



<p>The Monoprice DT-3BT firmly upholds that philosophy. At $100, these 50W desktop speakers offer an understated appearance and clear audio, and blend in well with a typical computer desk setup. They also focus more on function, rather than control over audio tuning. You get Bluetooth 5.0 support in addition to TRS and RCA jacks, allowing you to use them with a wide array of devices.</p>



<p>Each speaker measures 5.5 x 8.0 x 5.9 inches (140 x 204 x 150mm) and weighs 3.5 pounds (1.6kg) each. No wood tones here; the all-black coloring is meant to blend into the background. Inside are 3-inch woofer drivers and 0.75-inch tweeter drivers. All the action lives on the primary speaker&mdash;on the front, you&rsquo;ll find a comfortably sized volume knob, along with separate 3.5mm jacks for auxiliary input (e.g., a compatible smartphone or tablet) and headphone output, plus two status lights for power and Bluetooth status. On the back are RCA and 1/4-inch TRS inputs, outputs to connect to the secondary speaker, and buttons for power and Bluetooth pairing.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Note: Go to our ongoing roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407990/the-best-budget-computer-speakers.html">best budget computer speakers</a> to learn more about competing products, what to look for in budget computer speakers, and buying recommendations.</em></p></blockquote>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Monoprice DT-3BT speakers - rear view" class="wp-image-1447339" height="768" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Monoprice432402.webp" width="1024" /><figcaption>The primary speaker is where you&rsquo;ll manage all of your connections.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Monoprice</p></div>



<p>For setup, you simply connect the primary speaker and your PC using the color-coded RCA-to-3.5mm cable, and then link the primary and secondary speakers using the color-coded speaker interconnect cable. You&rsquo;ll also need to plug the primary speaker into a polarized 2-prong outlet for power.</p>



<p>Compared to rivals, the DT-3BT puts more emphasis on higher- and lower-end frequencies&mdash;right in line with Monoprice&rsquo;s other audio products. Some ears will find this sound profile to have a pleasing focus on clarity and crispness, while others may think it&rsquo;s a touch hollow. Either way, you can hear elements in layered music distinctly, when they otherwise get overshadowed or lost with warmer speakers.</p>



<p>And you can listen to those songs at extremely high volume (though with some distortion), if you so choose. These speakers can easily fill a smaller living room. I usually kept the knob at well below the quarter mark (figuratively speaking) for daytime listening, and cut it even further during later hours. And since you can play from different devices simultaneously, there&rsquo;s no real effort needed to switch between them. You just start playback from the desired piece of gear.</p>



<h2 id="should-you-buy-the-monoprice-dt-3bt">Should you buy the Monoprice DT-3BT? </h2>



<p>As speakers go, $100 may not seem like much&mdash;audiophiles can easily blow thousands on gear without blinking. But if you&rsquo;re on a budget, that amount can feel like a splurge. The Monoprice DT-3BT&rsquo;s feature set makes it feel worthy of its price tag. The speakers have straightforward setup and controls, immediately work out of the box with multiple audio sources, and boast clear audio. Those into the DT-3BT&rsquo;s sound profile should be well-pleased with them.</p>
