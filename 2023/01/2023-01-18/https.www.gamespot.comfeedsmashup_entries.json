But if you're not careful about the current Affinity Levels of your party, they can soon start turning against each other, leading to various annoying moments. Learning how to use this mechanic in your favor is key to making the most out of each expedition, and of course, managing to survive longer.</p><p>After the release of The Void Between Us update in January 2023, Relationships have been iterated quite drastically. As a mechanic that previously cause some debate in the community following the early access period, the latest tweaks should be more than welcome if you also thought that some of its randomized elements didn't quite work in its favor. This guide explains everything you need to know about Relationship Skills in Darkest Dungeon II, as well as the best ways to form positive relationships amongst your crew.</p><h2>How to form relationships in Darkest Dungeon II</h2><p>Relationships and Affinity go hand in hand. Your Affinity Level between characters is going to determine the types of relationships they can form, either positive or negative. After the release of The Void Between Us update, <strong>relationships can now only form at the Inn</strong>. In exception for the first one you visit after the introductory trip on your bandwagon, each subsequent visit to future Inns will result in different pairings.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/darkest-dungeon-2-relationship-skills-how-to-form-positive-relationships/1100-6510588/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/darkest-dungeon-2-resolute-how-stress-resolve-works/1100-6510589/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Darkest Dungeon 2 Resolute Guide - How Stress Resolve Works", "date_published": "2023-01-18 23:55:00+00:00", "description": "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/darkest-dungeon-ii/\">Darkest Dungeon II</a> Stress system is a trademark of the game that will be creeping onto your party members at all times. As relatable as it is in our current times, there are several in-game considerations to keep in mind. Some may just be what you need for your best heroes to prevail even in the worst situations. Others will only serve as temporary bandaids before suffering catches you by surprise once more.</p><p>Before getting all gloomy, this guide will explain how the new Resolute mechanic in Darkest Dungeon II works. This condition is one of the tweaks included in The Void Between Us update, released on January 2023, which also changes how Stress Resolve moments behave from now on.</p><h2>Darkest Dungeon II Resolute explained - how stress resolve works</h2><p>In the original Darkest Dungeon, once a character in your party reached their maximum stress level, there would be a moment of suspense that would leave to a negative or mostly trait. This would then stay with them as a permanent buff or debuff, unless you later treated it in the town.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/darkest-dungeon-2-resolute-how-stress-resolve-works/1100-6510589/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/darkest-dungeon-2-affinity-how-does-affinity-work/1100-6510587/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Darkest Dungeon 2 Affinity Guide - How Does Affinity Work?", "date_published": "2023-01-18 23:52:00+00:00", "description": "<p>Affinity is an integral mechanic in <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/darkest-dungeon-ii/\">Darkest Dungeon II</a>, carrying the torch from the first game while iterating on its foundation.

This guide dives into how affinity works in Darkest Dungeon II after the January 2023 update, and everything you need to keep in mind before embarking on this maddening journey.</p><h2>Darkest Dungeon II Affinity explained - how does Affinity work?</h2><p>Affinity is a scale-based points mechanic that is directly tied to the Relationships aspect of Darkest Dungeon II. Each pair of characters has an Affinity scale (which you can see at any point by opening the character screen and choosing the left tab) from 0 to 20 points. While they all start in a neutral state, gaining or losing Affinity points <strong>will tip the scale towards a negative or positive relationship</strong>.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/darkest-dungeon-2-affinity-how-does-affinity-work/1100-6510587/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/videos/one-piece-odyssey-video-review/2300-6460407/", "title": "One Piece Odyssey Video Review", "date_published": "2023-01-18 23:51:00+00:00", "description": "<img height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1352/13527689/4088210-review_onepieceodyssey_20220118v4.jpg\" width=\"480\" /> One Piece Odyssey captures the visual style and whimsy of the original material but stumbles at turning it into an engaging RPG.", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/videos/warzone-2-0-season-2-release-date-revealed-gamespot-news/2300-6460406/", "title": "Warzone 2.0 Season 2 Release Date Revealed | GameSpot News", "date_published": "2023-01-18 23:16:00+00:00", "description": "<img height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1352/13527689/4088209-news0118_v0.jpg\" width=\"480\" /> The second season of Warzone 2 and Modern Warfare 2\u2019s multiplayer was projected to go live on or around February 1, based on the days left in Season 1's battle pass.

Developer Bungie has now <a href=\"https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/buildcrafting\">detailed</a> a rundown of tweaks regarding loadouts, presenting a new system that will allow you to register different armor sets so you can switch between them on the fly. In addition, mods will undergo an interesting overhaul--and yes, this does include the often annoying Champion mods as well.</p><p>Starting with loadouts, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-destiny-2-lightfall-trailer-shows-off-the-secret-city-of-neomuna/1100-6510606/\">Lightfall</a> is introducing a dedicated panel on your Character screen with multiple slots. In them, you'll be able to create and name specific combinations of gear, including all three weapon slots, as well as your five pieces of gear.</p><p>According to Bungie, the idea for this new menu is to simplify the process of changing through different sets, which would often require multiple trips to the vault or the use of a second-screen app. Thanks to loadouts, you'll be able to have all of your gear at quick disposal, as well as identify each group with different icons, names, and colors depending on what you're planning to use them for (different activities, damage types, and so on.)</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lightfall-multiple-loadouts-new-mod-system-announced/1100-6510674/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-ceo-apologizes-for-controversial-all-hands-email-amid-public-struggles/1100-6510673/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Ubisoft CEO Apologizes For Controversial All-Hands Email Amid Public Struggles", "date_published": "2023-01-18 20:55:00+00:00", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Ubisoft, one of the largest video game publishers, has endured a number of highly-publicized roadblocks in recent weeks, especially after the release of disappointing financial results.

At the time, Marvel boss Kevin Feige confirmed that Boseman's role of King T'Challa would not be recast, and in fact the character would be retired from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Downey says as a result, the movie \"tries to be a few too many things at once\" but is also packed with \"amazing scenes and iconic shots.\" In a few weeks, you can check it out for yourself.</p><div>          </div><p dir=\"ltr\">Wednesdays throughout February will continue the bulk of Season 2 of Star Wars: The Bad Batch, which kicked off earlier in January with a two-episode premiere.
