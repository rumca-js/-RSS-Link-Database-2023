<p>The Met’s failure to investigate David Carrick shows how little changed even after the murder of Sarah Everard. It’s time for radical reform</p><p>The stories of police-perpetrated abuse of women that have emerged since the murder of Sarah Everard have been relentless and shocking – they show without doubt that there is something very rotten going on within the Metropolitan police force. In the wake of the case of David Carrick – a police officer who this week <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/16/metropolitan-police-officer-david-carrick-revealed-as-serial-rapist">pleaded guilty</a> to an astonishing 49 offences, including 24 rapes – public figures are queueing up to call out the Met’s culture. But where were they when these crimes – many of which could have been prevented – were being committed?</p><p>In 2021 Priti Patel, then home secretary, announced that there would be an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/nov/22/sarah-everard-former-prosecutor-to-lead-inquiry-into-and-by-police-officer">inquiry into Everard’s murder</a> at the hands of a serving Met officer. In response to Carrick’s conviction, she stood up in parliament and called for that <a href="https://www.centreforwomensjustice.org.uk/news/2023/1/17/cwj-statement-on-angiolini-inquiry-and-former-home-secretary-u-turn">inquiry to be put on a statutory footing</a>, so that it could examine the wider issues of violence against women within the Met police. This seemed a little odd, given that she resisted the call we made at the Centre for Women’s Justice (CWJ) in October 2021 to do precisely that, based on a number of other reports of serious offenders within the Met police – including Carrick himself, who had just been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/oct/05/priti-patel-public-inquiry-sarah-everard">charged with rape</a>.</p><p>Harriet Wistrich is a solicitor and the director of the Centre for Women’s Justice</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/18/women-britain-trust-met-police-david-carrick-sarah-everard">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘I want an indescribable feeling’: composer Kali Malone on her search for the sublime

<p>The US minimalist, acclaimed for her organ works, on moving beyond the instrument, the science of sound – and taking inspiration from the mountain ranges of her Denver youth</p><p>Listening to composer Kali Malone’s Does Spring Hide Its Joy is like watching weather move across a landscape. Sinewaves and strings swell gently, like a calm dawn; electric guitar overwhelms like clouds blocking the sun. It is the US composer’s fifth full-length album and her most expansive. It contains three hour-long versions of the piece, which has been performed with visuals that bathe the audience with pulsating bands of colour. “I want to create an immersive environment so that when it’s over, you don’t know how much time has passed,” Malone explains to me in the empty Purcell Room on London’s South Bank, the afternoon before a second performance.</p><p>The tenacious, smart Malone is still in her 20s but already has a large fanbase for her minimalist pieces. She writes for choir, electronics and other instruments, but after numerous split releases and EPs, her following snowballed in 2019 behind the organ dirges of The Sacrificial Code. It has become her signature instrument, one she regularly plays in famed churches and cathedrals – recently in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/apr/03/antoni-gaudi-sagrada-familia">Gaudí’s Sagrada Família in Barcelona</a>. But, she says emphatically: “I’m not an organist, I’m a composer.” And last year’s acclaimed <a href="https://kalimalone.bandcamp.com/album/living-torch">Living Torch</a> cemented her in a lineage of minimalists and electroacousticians, made on French artist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/16/eliane-radigue-electronic-music-interview">Éliane Radigue</a>’s rare ARP 2500 synthesiser: density builds through a melodic cycle; pitches cluster, roaring, occasionally breaking free to soar skyward. It has a glorious goth residue, resisting the feel of squeaky clean concert-hall classical.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/18/i-want-an-indescribable-feeling-composer-kali-malone-on-her-search-for-the-sublime">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The writer on switching from rock to poetry and how Sonnets for Albert explores his relationship with a missing parent who became an almost ‘mythological figure’ </p><p>As a young man, Anthony Joseph dreamed of becoming a rock star, not a critically acclaimed poet. In fact, had it not been for a box of papers he brought to the UK from Trinidad, where he grew up, the 46-year-old might never have come to write Sonnets for Albert, the collection that on Monday won him this year’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/16/anthony-joseph-wins-ts-eliot-prize-for-luminous-poetry-collection">TS Eliot prize</a>.</p><p>In the early 90s, the poet spent three years as the lead singer of Zedd, a “four-piece heavy Black rock band”. Shortly after Zedd disbanded, Joseph was unwell and stuck at home when he rediscovered the box he had brought with him when he moved to the UK in 1989. It contained sheets of lyrics and poems he had written while living with his grandparents as a teenager.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/18/ts-eliot-prize-winner-anthony-joseph-how-poetry-helped-me-love-my-absent-father">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There are finally positive signs for the game, but only after three years that diminished the CSL from its global standing</p><p>There cannot be many, if any, leagues that have been affected by the pandemic as much as the Chinese Super League. It was the first to deal with Covid-19 and, with China keeping stringent restrictions on daily life longer than elsewhere, the last to operate in tightly controlled conditions. With Beijing’s so-called zero-Covid policy <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/16/china-braces-for-covid-surge-as-lunar-new-year-travel-rush-begins">recently abandoned</a>, the country of 1.4bn people is finally opening up and this can only be good news for its beleaguered football industry.</p><p>2019 seems like a lifetime ago. Back then the league may have been losing a little of the lustre that made it one of the most-talked about in the world and some of the financial clout that had previously had coaches such as Antonio Conte, then of Chelsea, warning of the danger from the east, but the average attendance was still higher than anywhere else in Asia, at 24,000. There were still international stars such as Ezequiel Lavezzi, Graziano Pellè, Yannick Carrasco, Alex Teixeira, Javier Mascherano, Renato Augusto and Paulinho, and plenty of quality and excitement.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jan/18/china-football-crisis-what-happened-next-after-covid-struck">Continue reading...</a>

## Activists sue Ohio after Republicans impose new voting access restrictions

<p>Critics say this will make it harder for people who tend to lack identification – elderly people, the disabled and the poor – to vote</p><p>Ohio Republicans quietly enacted a measure earlier this month that imposes sweeping new restrictions on voting access in the state, including more stringent voter ID requirements, cutting the early voting period and giving voters less time to return their mail-in ballots.</p><p>The new law puts Ohio <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id#table1">among a handful of states</a> with the strictest voter ID rules in the country. The state had already required voters to show identification at the polls, but allowed an exception for voters who couldn’t produce one, allowing them to present a bank statement, paystub or other document to prove their identity. The new law gets rid of that exception and only allows someone to vote if they provide certain forms of photo ID.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/18/activists-sue-ohio-republican-voting-access-restrictions">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As the All-Star break looms, it’s time to look at the hits and the misses of the season so far</p><p>It’s a longstanding NBA custom to jump to conclusions. MVP chatter begins in the first week of the season, coaches are on the hot seat by week two, and before even a month has passed, “burn it down” roster discussions emerge. Far be it from me to stray from tradition. So here, a month before the All-Star break, are my too-early NBA Season Superlatives, a selection of premature evaluations and awards plucked out of thin air.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/18/nba-midseason-superlatives-surprising-kings-to-lakers-questions">Continue reading...</a>
