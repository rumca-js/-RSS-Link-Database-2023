With his penis exposed. Completely out in the open. No underwear. Nothing. Just penis. </p><p>You may be shocked to hear that this upset people. Such prudes. </p><p>A Twitter user with the handle \"@troonytoons\" posted censored images of Rosemary in public places with his junk hanging out. Rosemary apparently shared these images to his Flickr account in the group \"Transgender Cafe.\"</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cRosemarytimes2 on Flickr, likes to share pictures to the group \\u201cTransgender Cafe\\u201d exposing himself in public\\u201d</div> \u2014 TroonyToons (@TroonyToons)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/troonytoons/status/1612155825795268608\">1673202875</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After some sleuthing, internet peeps were able to trace the location of these photos to Nottingham's Victoria Centre mall. The mall gave a short statement to the Nottingham Post newspaper regarding the incident: \"We are aware of the tweets in question and are looking into the incident. Any form of indecent exposure will not be tolerated and will result in our security team issuing an immediate ban from the centre and reporting any incident to Nottinghamshire Police.\"</p><p>These images led to uproar from female social media users, highlighting the issue of allowing people with penises into <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/high-school-locker-room\" target=\"_blank\">spaces meant for people without penises</a>. It's quite simple, really: some areas just aren't hospitable to penises.

My guess is many other people acted the same. No matter how many virtue-signalling songs they sang about being hashtag all in this together, they were hugging family members and not walking around their homes masked up. They only pretended to be about the elbow bumps when the cameras were on and they were performing for a captive audience.</p><p>Stern is one of the few who fell for the narrative in ernest. He comes across as a recluse who did, in fact, walk around his house in a mask and refused to let loved ones get within six feet of him, let alone touch him. I wonder how many of his colleagues and employees humored on camera but were then laughing at him in the privacy of their own homes.</p><p>I also feel bad for BABA BOOEY'S son.

So when there is a dispute in a park between an old man sitting on a bench and an in-flu-ence-rrrrrrrrrr carrying on about her live stream, the old man is always in the right. </p><p>The low-key best part about the video is how ridiculous some of the words said online sound when part of an IRL conversation.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">Chad park man puts snotty influencer in her place. <a href=\"https://t.co/FyO8JWbJ0y\">pic.twitter.com/FyO8JWbJ0y</a><br />\u2014 Catch Up (@CatchUpNetwork) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CatchUpNetwork/status/1615429498991697931?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 17, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>The dispute can best be summarized with the in-flu-ence-rrrrrrrrrr being all \"but muh live stream\" and the old man being all \"piss on your live stream.\" That was the old man's bench. He sits on it every day and he was going to sit on it that day. When the in-flu-ence-rrrrrrrrrrs and the followers and the whole internet tell you to move, your job is to plant yourself like a tree beside the river of truth, and tell the in-flu-ence-rrrrrrrrrrs \u2014 \u201cNo, you move.\u201d</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"f5dbf\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32865842&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>The in-flu-ence-rrrrrrrrrr kept carrying on about her <em>followers</em> and how she was trying to film a nice fitness video for her <em>followers</em> and how her <em>followers</em> didn't want to see an old man sitting on a park bench. Her followers want to see HER. At this point, the man ended the argument.</p><blockquote>Your followers. Oh, are you Jesus now, are you?</blockquote><p>Sorry, I take it back. The man only mostly ended the argument. This was the mic drop after the in-flu-ence-rrrrrrrrrr whined that it wasn't fair.</p><blockquote>Are you from that snow flake brigade, are you?</blockquote><p>Boom. After three rounds, the old man is declared the winner by TKO.
