<p>Scottish legislation redeems the promises made by a previous Tory prime minister, yet both sides are now in a constitutional showdown</p><p>The provision of identity lies at the heart of a modern state. But a person’s sense of who they are is not as fixed as it once was. UK law has yet to catch up with the idea that people can identify in many ways. It’s easier, perhaps, to continue with the status quo. Often reforms fail because legitimate concerns cannot be assuaged or they do not attract the support of the <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/society/articles-reports/2022/07/20/where-does-british-public-stand-transgender-rights">public</a>. Reactionary politicians can also successfully exploit fears about change. All these reasons, and more, lie behind the repeated failure by the Westminster government to update the 2004 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/17/westminster-block-on-scotlands-gender-recognition-bill-may-be-gift-to-the-snp">Gender Recognition Act</a> (GRA), the law that enables transgender people in Britain to have their acquired gender recognised.</p><p>The SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, deserves credit for to attempting to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/22/scotland-passes-bill-making-it-easier-for-people-to-legally-change-gender">modernise</a> the law by taking into account the concerns of a vulnerable, marginalised community through democratic debate. Scottish parties split over the process, which resulted in a bill that liberalises the rules on changing legal gender in Scotland. Holyrood has made good on Theresa May’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/18/theresa-may-plans-to-let-people-change-gender-without-medical-checks">pledge</a>, as Conservative prime minister in 2017, to “streamlin[e] and demedicalis[e] the process for changing gender”. While Mrs May’s parliamentary <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/17/sixteen-is-old-enough-to-decide-on-gender-says-education-secretary">faction</a> remains influential, it is the grassroots’ favourite rightwinger <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/kemi-badenoch-knocked-out-of-tory-leadership-race-as-field-narrows-to-three-12654785">Kemi Badenoch</a> who, as the Tory equalities minister, has a louder legislative voice.</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

<p>Rishi Sunak lacks both the imagination to turn Boris Johnson’s slogan into a real policy, and the courage to abandon it</p><p>Conservative prime ministers are adept at finding ways to talk about inequality without naming the problem. David Cameron bemoaned “broken Britain” and proposed “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/jul/19/david-cameron-big-society-launch">the big society</a>” as a remedy. The idea was that civic bonds could be strengthened to fill gaps left by cuts to state services. Theresa May pledged to address “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/13/theresa-may-becomes-britains-prime-minister">burning injustices</a>”, which she rightly identified as drivers of support for Brexit. But then she alighted on immigration as the emblematic problem. She saw that globalisation’s bounty had been unfairly distributed, but retreated to the politics of blaming foreigners.</p><p>Then came Boris Johnson and “<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-unveils-levelling-up-plan-that-will-transform-uk">levelling up</a>”. Here, too, was recognition that many communities had been left behind and needed active government to help them catch up. But Mr Johnson’s idea, like most of his rhetoric, was a product of magical thinking. He wanted to spend money in deprived areas without making the case for increased public borrowing or raising new revenue from affluent voters.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/18/the-guardian-view-on-levelling-up-a-badge-of-tory-confusion">Continue reading...</a>

<p>World No 159 has endured his own lengthy list of injuries but is looking forward to taking on the Scot at the Australian Open</p><p>Years ago, before Thanasi Kokkinakis first met Andy Murray, he formed a preconceived idea about the Scottish player’s temperament. “I remember watching him when I was younger thinking: ‘This dude looks moody as hell, he looks miserable,’” Kokkinakis says. “Then, when you got to know him, he is actually a ripper bloke and a good guy. I’ll put all that aside and give it a crack tomorrow.”</p><p>Thursday’s second-round encounter at Melbourne Park will be a meeting of colleagues who very well could be friends. They know each other not through on-court battles – they have played each other just once, a straight-sets win for Murray at the 2015 Davis Cup – but through the guidance the younger has received from the elder. Most recently, that came in the form of some coaching in the lead-up to the US Open.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/18/thanasi-kokkinakis-to-meet-part-time-mentor-andy-murray-melbourne-australian-open-tennis">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sunak has chosen to pick a fight with the nurses – a battle he’s never going to win</p><p>Rishi Sunak is the incredible shrinking man. The more you see of him, the less there appears to be. When he became prime minister, he had the appearance of a moderately successful – if rather over-eager – tech bro, brought in to save the Conservative party from itself. But that was a chimera. Because Rish! isn’t even that successful. He’s a politician with the fatal flaw of not being very good at politics. A man unable to convince others that he inhabits their world. Now he’s just a ball of need. Desperate to be liked, but unable to make an emotional connection with voters.</p><p>To be fair, Sunak has the odds stacked against him. It’s not entirely his fault the Tories voted for Liz Truss rather than him. Though imagine how useless the Conservative membership must think him to be if they went full on Trussterfuck. It’s not his fault that Putin invaded Ukraine. But he has to take the blame for the Tories’ record of 13 years in government when it’s hard to think of anything that works better now than it did in 2010.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/18/the-incredible-shrinking-man-rishi-sunaks-gut-reaction-is-always-wrong">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Author Philip Marsden on how Raban, who has died aged 80, brought us his darkly comic and sardonic view of the world</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/18/jonathan-raban-travel-writer-and-novelist-dies-aged-80">Jonathan Raban, travel writer and novelist, dies aged 80</a></li></ul><p>Jonathan Raban, who has died this week at the age of 80, was one of a generation of writers who helped to drag travel writing away from its hotel-reviewing, holiday-brochure corridor and into the halls of literature. Colin Thubron, Paul Theroux, Redmond O’Hanlon and Bruce Chatwin were among those (almost all men) who in the late 1970s and early 1980s resurrected the journey as one of the great narrative structures. They produced books that celebrate big ideas, remote places and the endless and ageless diversity of our planet. In Raban’s case, he did it with a view of the world that was both darkly comic and sardonic, delivered in prose that can pierce your heart with its accuracy.</p><p>As well as his travel books, Raban wrote dazzling essays and criticism, spotting writers’ weaknesses but always relishing success when he saw it on the page. John Updike “comes to grip with the contrary fabric of things with a kind of intelligent wonder”. Byron “had a genius for turning his entire life into a grand retrospective exhibition”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/18/jonathan-raban-his-travel-writing-could-pierce-your-heart">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Masterpiece of a film’: why is every A-lister trying to get To Leslie an Oscar?

<p>A surge of celebrity endorsements for Andrea Riseborough’s performance in a little-seen indie drama offer a strange case study in Oscar campaigning</p><p>Depending on one’s interest in film awards, it may or may not be apparent that the business of the Oscars is a nearly year-long affair. The pieces for an Oscar campaign – a full-time job with its own PR, schmoozing schedule and the momentum of smaller awards to achieve enough votes for a nomination – are usually in place months ahead of time. The window provides time to tweak and build a narrative; there is nothing Hollywood loves more than a comeback or underdog story (see: this year’s supporting actor frontrunner <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/12/awards-insider-ke-huy-quans-true-hollywood-comeback">Ke Huy Quan</a> or best actress contender <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/13/i-told-jackie-chan-everything-everywhere-all-at-once-gave-michelle-yeoh-the-role-of-a-lifetime">Michelle Yeoh</a>). Yet even most seasoned awards-followers have been surprised by the very late-breaking, star-studded campaign to garner Andrea Riseborough, a British character actor, an Oscar nomination for her leading role in To Leslie, a little-seen indie drama that has made barely $27,000 since a small theatrical release in October.</p><p>Even in the smoke-and-mirrors world of Hollywood myth-making, the display of public celebrity muscle for Riseborough’s performance in recent days has seemed strange. Prior to the past two weeks, there had been almost no buzz for To Leslie, the feature debut by veteran television director Michael Morris – a few screenings, but no visible awards campaign. Yet in recent days, a sizable squadron of celebrities have come to bat for the film and, more pointedly, Riseborough’s performance as an itinerant, alcoholic mother from West Texas reeling from six years of shame after squandering a $190,000 lottery prize.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/18/to-leslie-andrea-riseborough-oscar-campaign">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As he hits 80 and releases a softly raging album inspired by the ugliness of the pandemic years, the ever restless and eternally avant-garde musician unburdens himself</p><p>John Cale is wearing a priest’s black cassock and a string of pearls where the dog collar should go. A shock of white hair completes the outfit, which he proudly sports in the video to his recent comeback song Story of Blood. In it, he plunges his hands into red pigment as tinted photographs of burials and baptisms flicker by. “This is the story of blood,” he repeats, his weathered voice cradled by the warm alto of Natalie Mering, AKA Weyes Blood. “It moves all around, brings you down.”</p><p>“I was trying to suggest things rather than knock people on the head with it,” says Cale, speaking from his adopted home of Los Angeles. But, he laments, “I’m really bad at toning things down.” Death has been on his mind. His new video doesn’t quite have the shock value of his earlier stage antics (think hockey masks, chicken decapitations, blood-spattered mannequins) but Cale is the rare artist who is still surprising his fans, and perhaps himself, even as he enters his 80s.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/18/humanity-brick-wall-john-cale-velvets-nico-covid-gun-ridden-world-gone-bad">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>PC, Mac, PlayStation 4/5, Xbox, Nintendo Switch (version played); Mojiken Studio/Toge Productions<br /></strong>The story of Atma and his reality-warping girlfriend Raya demonstrates a flair for the dramatic and will keep you guessing right up to the end</p><p>The video game charts tend to be dominated by titles from US, European and Japanese studios, and as such the games we play are awash with those cultural influences. So it’s a welcome treat to play something from an Indonesian developer, infused with less familiar references. For example, I now know that <em>keroncong</em> is a genre of music based around a ukulele-like instrument.</p><p>A Space for the Unbound tells the tale of Atma and Raya, two high-school students growing up in late-90s Indonesia. In many ways it’s similar to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/18/attack-of-the-friday-monsters">Attack of the Friday Monsters!</a>, a much-loved, nostalgia-heavy 2013 Nintendo DS title about children exploring their Japanese home town in the 1970s. Like that game, A Space for the Unbound’s beautiful anime art style captures the spirit of idyllic childhood memories, where it’s always summer and the sky is forever cerulean blue. It also shares a penchant for the fantastical, blurring the line between the imaginary and real.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jan/18/a-space-for-the-unbound-review-indonesian-school-adventure-has-a-fantastical-twist">Continue reading...</a>

<ul><li>Former Crawley manager’s 15-month ban a ‘slap in the face’</li><li>FA ‘fundamentally disagreed’ with its independent panel</li></ul><p>Anti-racism campaigners have warned a “dangerous precedent” has been set after the former Crawley manager John Yems avoided a life ban from football because multiple instances of discriminatory behaviour were deemed to be “not consciously” racist.</p><p>An independent regulatory commission chose this month to suspend Yems from the game until 1 June 2024, for 12 breaches of anti-discrimination rules. But in explaining the sanction the FA-authorised panel said they had opted for a shorter punishment because they did not believe Yems was being deliberately racist. The Guardian understands that such a consideration exceeded the terms under which the commission was supposed to operate.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/18/fa-panel-condemned-after-finding-john-yems-to-be-not-a-conscious-racist">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Gangster mashup deserves credit for fighting the corner of the city’s cinema in the face of the mainland film behemoth</p><p>Hoping to sustain a recent mini-resurgence of Hong Kong films through to lunar new year, Ying Chi-wen’s second feature is a silly, initially laboured but increasingly endearing comedy mashup. A remake of 2021 Taiwanese gangster film Treat or Trick, which is itself a do-over of 2004 Korean horror-comedy To Catch a Virgin Ghost, it manages to hit virtually every branch on the genre tree on the way down: Bad Boys buddy action comedy, dead wet girl Asian horror, knockabout Beijing opera farce, wuxia parody.</p><p>Yau Shing (Hong Kong singer Hins Cheung) is a hotshot point man in Ray-Bans for So Good security firm. Told to escort a consignment of diamonds across the city, he fails to anticipate his driver Jelly (Kaho Hung) hightailing it with the bling, which also cheeses off some bungling triads out to nab it. So the gang boss orders his minion Monk (Michael Ning), as well as Yau Shing and rookie recruit Penguin (Jeffrey Ngai Tsun Sang), to the off-the-grid village where Jelly has holed up on his way to Malaysia.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/18/everything-under-control-review-endearing-comedy-caper-from-hong-kong">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘The elevated section of track had become dilapidated and was due for demolition. This woman is worried about gentrification, which could lead to the area losing its homeless shelter’  </p><p></p><p>The Orange Line is part of the public transport system in Boston. It opened in 1901. Most of it was underground but its last four miles, in the south-west of the city, came out in Chinatown and went up to Forest Hills. By the early 1980s, this section of elevated railway had become dilapidated, dirty and dangerous, which inadvertently resulted in the area having affordable housing, the low rents attracting people who couldn’t afford to live in other parts of Boston. Homelessness and poverty became big issues.</p><p>The section was scheduled for demolition in 1985. There were concerns that, when the overhead railway came down, gentrification would happen, displacing the people who lived there. I was one of five photographers commissioned by the Urban Arts organisation to capture what we found interesting along this stretch before it was demolished.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jan/18/boston-orange-line-gentrification-homeless-jack-lueders-booth-photograph">Continue reading...</a>

After smoking it over a red gum fire for hours, the chef chills it, whips it and presents the spread with smoked salt alongside the restaurant’s sourdough bread. “In the past, we’ve done a wild garlic butter, a white soy and garlic butter and a few other iterations – a favourite being our roast chicken fat and maple syrup butter with chives, lemon and crispy chicken skin.” But smoked brown butter remains the biggest hit and backs up trend watchers’ claims that “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/07/style/lifestyle-trends-2023.html">butter’s appeal is eternal</a>”.</p><p>Kaul thinks butter is having a moment because restaurants are devoting as much thought to their bread course as the rest of the menu. “Where butter has often played second fiddle to bread, it’s become a really wonderful creative outlet for chefs where every single bite is considered,” she says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/19/why-restaurants-churn-out-mountains-of-butter-its-hard-to-identify-if-any-amount-is-enough">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Patton Oswalt devises an ill-advised plan to win over his son in an inspired film that plumbs new depths of embarrassment </p><p>An excruciatingly heartfelt performance from Patton Oswalt carries this high-concept indie picture from writer-director James Morosini. It’s a film that genuinely does take the comedy of embarrassment to a new level. Morosini says that it’s based on a real incident in his own life; I can believe it. You couldn’t make it up. There is a stranger-than-fiction authenticity to the whole horrifying mess, in which Morosini cleverly uses real home-movie footage of his own childhood. The final 15 minutes have to be watched through your fingers.</p><p>Oswalt plays a well-meaning but weak and foolish guy called Chuck who has been a terrible husband (he’s now divorced) and a terrible deadbeat dad, having let his son down all his life. The son is twentysomething Franklin, played by Morosini, who is in treatment for depression and living with his mom Diane (Amy Landecker). Infuriated by the way his deeply unreliable and whiny dad is never there for him, Franklin refuses to take his calls and blocks him on social media. And so in desperate despair, Chuck fakes the online profile of an attractive young woman to contact his son – “catfish” him, essentially – and stay in touch, using the photograph of a local diner waitress called Becca (Claudia Sulewski).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/18/i-love-my-dad-review-patton-oswalt">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Fans and bands fear regional network that helped launch careers of Ed Sheeran and Little Simz will be cut back as BBC confirms changes to schedules</p><p>It is the nationwide network of weekly regional radio programmes and festival stages that has helped launch the careers of British superstars such as Ed Sheeran, Florence + the Machine, Celeste and Little Simz. But now, the future of BBC Music Introducing is believed to be under threat. For days, social media has been buzzing with reports that the local radio side of what the BBC calls its “platform supporting unsigned, undiscovered, and under-the-radar UK music talent” is to be scaled down, with claims that all 32 BBC Introducing presenters across the UK have been put on notice of redundancy.</p><p>A source told the Guardian that the plan was to “rationalise” the network, with a two-thirds reduction in the number of shows, which would then operate across larger regional boundaries. Such changes would greatly increase competition and reduce the amount of airtime available for individual emerging artists.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/18/a-fundamental-blow-anger-over-threat-to-bbc-introducing-music-discovery-platform">Continue reading...</a>

## Top 10 books about family secrets | Jyoti Patel

<p>Lies told and truths hidden give compelling life to fiction and memoir by authors from Maggie O’Farrell to Ocean Vuong and Claire Keegan</p><p><br />Where there are families there are stories and where there are stories there are always secrets. It’s ripe crop for a writer. In literature, these are a staple of the coming-of-age novel. Family secrets seem to rise to the surface when a protagonist steps from childhood into adulthood, in that equally devastating and freeing moment of realising that one exists both within a family and outside of it, too.</p><p>It’s something I find myself drawn towards as a reader and as a writer – to the way untold truths take root between friends, lovers, families. In my debut novel, <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-things-that-we-lost-9781529186338?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article">The Things That We Lost</a>, I explore a family history through the eyes of a British Indian mother and son, Avani and Nik, as Nik tries to uncover the circumstances of his father’s death.<br /><br />Whether in memoirs, novels or short stories, I’m also interested in the negotiation that takes place between a narrator and reader when secrets are involved, whether the two stand side by side in unearthing them, or the dramatic irony that charges through a story when truths are revealed to one but not the other. Here are 10 books that pull off this kind of negotiation especially well.<br /><br /><strong>1. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/sep/05/claire-keegan-short-story-interview">Foster by Claire Keegan</a><br /></strong>The story opens with the narrator’s father leaving her with the Kinsellas, a couple who live on a farm in rural Ireland. Cautious at first, the compassion she is shown by the couple draws her closer to them. She is bathed, fed, loved, and told, fervently, “there are no secrets in this house”. Except there are, or rather, there is one, sitting quietly behind the couple’s tenderness towards the girl. It’s the memory of their bereaved son, whose clothes the narrator wears to mass, whose room she sleeps in. A subtle, beautiful tale, all the more powerful for its succinctness.<br /><br /><strong>2. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/14/on-earth-we-are-briefly-gorgeous-ocean-vuong-review">On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous by Ocean Vuong</a> <br /></strong>This novel takes the form of a letter from Little Dog, a Vietnamese American narrator, to his illiterate mother. The fact that she will never be able to read it creates the perfect occasion for sincerity, for whispering truths that will never be heard. Revelations are made, secrets surface. Little Dog discovers fragments of his family’s history, the trauma they fled, and how all of this can lead him back to the pieces of himself.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/18/top-10-books-about-family-secrets-jyoti-patel-the-things-that-we-lost">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The HBO version of the post-apocalyptic has had rave reviews. From Silent Hill to Broken Sword, here are others that could really shine on the small screen</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2021/nov/24/sign-up-for-pushing-buttons-keza-macdonalds-weekly-look-at-the-world-of-gaming">Don’t get Pushing Buttons delivered to your inbox? Sign up here</a></strong></li></ul><p>With the benefit of hindsight, it was always going to be television and not film where the first genuinely authentic video game tie-in would happen. The format of the ongoing drama series, with its capacity for multiple character and narrative arcs, as well as its extended running time, aligns much more closely with how games actually function. Even so, I am surprised by just how brilliant episode one of The Last of Us (HBO in the US, Sky Atlantic in the UK) is. It beautifully weaves the conventions of both TV and games into one gripping experience, using subjective camera shots to put us into the viewpoint of characters (like a game), while also toying with depth of field in a very televisual way to blur out background details for thrilling effect (oh god, the shaking granny!). Ever the optimist, I’m thinking that maybe – <em>maybe</em> – this series has unlocked a new set of multidisciplinary tools that will enable other TV and game makers to collaborate on exciting dramas.</p><p>So, what next? Yes, we’re only on episode one, but you can bet there are TV producers and video game creative directors looking at the critical acclaim handed out to the series and thinking, hmm, I fancy a piece of that. We know that TV productions based on Life Is Strange, God of War and Horizon Zero Dawn are on the way. What else would work?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jan/18/pushing-buttons-last-of-us-hbo-adaptation">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>PlayStation 4/5, Xbox One, PC; ILCA/Bandai Namco<br /></strong>A bonkers collection of epic adventures and side-quests sprinkled with puzzles that fans of the Japanese pop-cultural behemoth have been crying out for</p><p>One Piece is a pop-culture behemoth that, unaccountably, never gained traction outside of Japan. Officially the biggest-selling manga comic series ever, it is now celebrating its 25th anniversary, and One Piece Odyssey honours that milestone. Previous attempts to expand this fun-loving pirate crew’s story beyond comic books have lacked credibility, but with this game, Bandai Namco goes a long way towards redressing the balance.</p><p>It is, simply, the One Piece game that fans have been crying out for all this time: a classic, 40-hour-plus Japanese RPG that brings in all the genre’s best-loved elements (and some lesser-loved ones). It has turn-based battles, embellished with retina-frazzling special moves that emphasise each characters’ style and abilities; bizarre, often baffling terminology; layers of side-quests and sub-quests sprinkled with puzzle sequences; and an obsession with cooking and food. The only thing it lacks is a fishing mini-game.</p><p>One Piece Odyssey is out now; £49.99</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jan/18/one-piece-odyssey-review-the-pirate-adventure-that-manga-fans-deserve">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The gang of pitch-perfect actors give this show the perfect, elusive blend of truthful, joyful and funny</p><p>I have been remiss. I realise now, as its second series begins, that I have neglected to proclaim to you at every possible opportunity over these last few vexing years that help was at hand to smooth your passage through the dark days. I apologise unreservedly and say now: let The Sex Lives of College Girls (ITVX) comfort you and, also, I must state that it is not porn because I know that’s what you’re thinking. It is the creation of writer, actor, director and production powerhouse <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/31/mindy-kaling-i-was-so-embarrassed-about-being-a-diversity-hire">Mindy Kaling</a> (The Office, Never Have I Ever, The Mindy Project) and Justin Noble (a writer on Brooklyn Nine-Nine and Never Have I Ever) and is the perfect, elusive blend of truthful, joyful and funny.</p><p>It focuses on the adventures and misadventures (often genital based) of a quartet of roommate freshers at the fancy fictional Essex College in Vermont. Whitney (Alyah Chanelle Scott) is a star soccer player whose mother is a US senator, which in the first series made it all the more important that she didn’t find out Whitney was having an affair with her assistant soccer coach. The parents of Indian-American Bela (Amrit Kaur) were equally shielded from the knowledge that their daughter was less interested in her neuroscience studies than she was in becoming a comedy writer and topographer of shredded frat boys. Leighton (Reneé Rapp) is the rich legacy student from the Upper East Side – an all-American blonde from a picture-perfect family that will shatter if they discover she is gay. And sweet Kimberly (Pauline Chalamet – yes, sister of Timothée), as naive and enthusiastic as a labrador puppy, is a small-town scholarship girl who has to navigate all the barriers life among the moneyed elite brings. Individually, the actors are pitch-perfect. Together, they are something special. At their best they remind you of the Friends’ chemistry which – whatever you thought of the show then or think of it now – was spectacular.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/18/the-sex-lives-of-college-girls-review-this-comedys-spectacular-chemistry-makes-it-the-modern-day-friends">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Krieps and the late Gaspard Ulliel bring great conviction and intelligence to this unlikely tale of a woman’s last adventure</p><p>Here is a painful, intimate, impeccably acted if not entirely plausible drama of terminal illness with an extra-textual layer of sadness and irony. The estimable Vicky Krieps plays Hélène, who is dying of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (a rare lung disease) and her partner is becoming her carer: this is Matthieu, played by Gaspard Ulliel – who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/19/gaspard-ulliel-french-actor-dies-skiing-accident">died in a skiing accident</a> shortly after this film was completed. Director Emily Atef dedicates the movie to him in the closing credits.</p><p>The agonising, debilitating nature of the disease takes its toll on the couple and their friends and family who have no way of talking about it or coming to terms with it. Hélène is also oppressed by the way she is supposed to be joyful and grateful at being on a lung transplant list which might mean unpleasant and, if the organ is rejected, possibly futile surgery. She broods on various blogs by people from around the world with the same condition and is entranced by one from a Norwegian guy with the handle Mister (Bjørn Floberg); he is without the usual platitudes, witty and down-to-earth about his mortality.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/18/more-than-ever-review-fine-acting-end-of-life-drama-vicky-krieps-gaspard-ulliel">Continue reading...</a>

Many stories have been told about mothers helping their child through their first period and into young adulthood, and the animated comedy Little Demon (Disney+) begins by following the usual script. Single mother Laura drops 13-year-old Chrissy off for her first day at Middletown junior high, Delaware. While nervously making friends with a boy in the corridor, Chrissy feels an unfamiliar sensation, runs in embarrassment to the toilet and finds blood.</p><p>Then, however, Chrissy descends into a trance-like rage and murders two school bullies, ripping off their heads and plastering the walls with their viscera. Having hastily picked Chrissy up in the car, her mum explains: “Your vagina just became a homing device for the Prince of Darkness.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/18/little-demon-review-danny-devitos-super-fun-animation-is-absolute-filth">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Internet dating can feel soul-destroying, unnerving and transactional. Couples explain how their love lives were transformed when they finally stopped swiping</p><p>When Georgie Thorogood’s date made a sleazy joke about “horsey girls carrying whips”, she knew it was time to make a hasty exit. After meeting Tom through a dating app in the summer of 2021, she had been hoping for some polite conversation over a few drinks, maybe some romantic chemistry if she was lucky. What she got was a two-hour rant about his ex-wife and some creepy innuendo. “I knew straight away he wasn’t for me. I politely told him I didn’t want to see him again, but he took the rejection really badly. I work in music communications and at the time I was setting up a festival. He started getting aggressive and telling me that I was destined to fail,” she says. “I don’t know how he could possibly know that, as he didn’t ask me a single question about myself all night.”</p><p>Her bad experience, which came after months of mindless swiping, was the final straw for Georgie, 40. “Not only did I find <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/nov/20/the-rise-and-fall-of-dating-apps">dating apps</a> soul-destroying, I was also happy with my single life, so I decided to quit them completely and focus on that instead,” she says. “I found so many of the men on apps had serious issues, too. Another guy became abusive when I turned down an offer to meet for a walk in a remote location because it didn’t feel safe. You never know who people are online.” While Georgie acknowledges that people with emotional baggage aren’t exclusive to dating sites, she feels the apps give them a chance to hide their bad behaviour. “The problem is that you don’t have to reflect or make changes when something goes wrong – you can just swipe to the next person.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/18/dating-burnout-meet-the-people-who-ditched-the-apps-and-found-love-offline">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Engaging study of artists and radicals hanging on at the legendary New York building in the face of hungry developers is charming but vague</p><p>New York’s Chelsea Hotel (strictly, the Hotel Chelsea) is the almost mythic building renowned for the radical bohemianism and life-on-the-edge danger of its famous residents, who have included Dylan Thomas, Patti Smith, Sid Vicious, Bob Dylan, Madonna and Iggy Pop. But unlike CBGBs or checker cabs, the Chelsea is a New York institution that does in fact still exist, and is the subject of this interesting, if meanderingly vague documentary from Maya Duverdier and Amélie van Elmbt.</p><p>It is all about the now ageing artists and radicals still living there, such as dancer and choreographer Merle Lister, who once staged performances in the Chelsea’s beautiful stairwell with its wrought-iron balustrades. They are the ageing holdout generation with legally protected tenancy – and they resent the forces of gentrification for trying to evict them and ruin the Chelsea’s artistic spirit. A property developer bought it in 2011 and has been striving for an upgrade. But this is more of an apartment building than a hotel, so the overhaul is no simple matter.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/18/dreaming-walls-review-chelsea-hotels-window-on-last-days-of-bohemia">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Cries of witchcraft greet any woman who dares threaten a cruel patriarchy in this richly drawn medieval world</p><p>Near the beginning of Kirsty Logan’s fine new novel, a travelling theatre company stages a nocturnal performance on a frozen lake. It’s winter and this play, which tracks a woman’s trajectory from maiden to mother to crone, is a small smudge of light in a grim surround of dark. It’s the perfect image – life atop icy precarity; festive warmth upon unforgiving cold – to set the stage for a tale whose protagonist will be confronted by many perilous contrasts.</p><p>Her name is Lux, and when we first meet her she is standing in a garden of poisonous herbs above the remains of her recently buried mother, who has been unjustly executed for witchcraft. In the harsh world of Now She Is Witch, which would seem to be some version of medieval Europe, most girls and women are possessions for men either to harm or play with. Any who assume agency are swiftly denounced and brutally dealt with: those labelled witches are tied to poles in the sea and left to slowly drown; others guilty of lesser offences (talking too much, too loudly or indeed at all) are paraded around in scold’s bridles, torture devices deployed to humiliate.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/18/now-she-is-witch-by-kirsty-logan-review-a-quest-for-freedom">Continue reading...</a>

What is different is that this journey, of 1519, was from west to east – from the so-called “New World” back towards Europe.</p><p>The ship was loaded with so much treasure that gold was used as ballast; a first addictive hit of the vast mineral wealth of the Americas that was to flow around an increasingly interconnected global economy. However, it is the people on board, rather than the treasure in the hold, that are the focus here: not the European conquistadors but the indigenous people, in this case a group of Totonac men and women from what is now Mexico.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/18/on-savage-shores-by-caroline-dodds-pennock-review-a-whole-new-world">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With its tree-lined ski slopes and starlit forest hikes, the traditional village of Villard-de-Lans, near Grenoble, made me fall back in love with skiing holidays</p><p>‘Off-piste? You must be joking!” It was my first post-pandemic ski trip after a few years off the slopes, and I’m not a hugely confident skier at the best of times. I had been nervous before setting off, and unsure whether I could face the hassle of skiing holidays (the cold! the boots!) any more. Like lots of people, I’d lost my travel mojo. What was wrong with hibernating at home for the winter?</p><p>Then I arrived at <a href="https://uk.villarddelans-correnconenvercors.com/">Villard-de-Lans</a>, a traditional village resort in the Vercors plateau in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region of south-eastern France. The sun was shining, the pistes were quiet and a couple of easy warmup runs reminded me why I fell in love with skiing 25 years ago. Before long, I was swishing down gorgeous, tree-lined slopes backdropped by huge limestone crags. The resort connects two villages, Villard and Corrençon-en-Vercors, and is absurdly picturesque – a mix of forest runs winding between fir trees and powder fields with panoramic views of peaks and canyons. This year, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/04/warmest-january-ever-forces-ski-slopes-across-europe-to-close">a lack of snow</a> has affected the resort – as with many places across Europe – but pistes have reopened this week.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/jan/18/skiing-vercors-plateau-villard-grenoble-france-alps">Continue reading...</a>

Oh boy, was I wrong! It took an exhausting 72 hours for Musa to make his entrance, and just when the doctors were preparing me for an emergency C-section, he came shooting into this world. It was messy and it took me a long time to recover, both mentally and physically.</p><p>For me, giving birth was far from the idealistic birth plan I had carefully crafted for myself.

<p>Leftwingers, rightwingers: Mindy Kaling’s new TV show has outraged them all. She’d have gotten away with it, if it wasn’t for those meddling viewers</p><p>We live in a hyperpartisan world where nobody can agree on anything. And yet, every now and again something comes along that bridges political differences and brings people together.

(<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/12/velma-review-mindy-kaling-scooby-doo">Except, rather weirdly, the Guardian</a>, which gave it four out of five stars.)

I have no idea. My understanding is that she probably didn’t and that people are just getting angry online because people like getting angry online. The left appears to be angry at Kaling because she once liked a tweet by JK Rowling, which supposedly means she is an irredeemable <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=kaling%20trans&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top">transphobe</a> who should be cancelled immediately. The right, meanwhile, doesn’t seem to like the fact that Velma is a lesbian in the show and Kaling is a brown woman. One rightwing comedian called it “<a href="https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/comment/scooby-doo-spin-velma-isnt-28950816">openly racist against white people</a>”. Other people are saying the series is “<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/adult-scooby-doo-reboot-velma-ripped-critics-audiences-where-everything-horribly-wrong">insulting to the Scooby-Doo fanbase</a>”.

<p>Plantwatch pays tribute to a water-resistant species whose uses range from flood defence to Hendrix’s Fender Stratocaster</p><p>Weeks of rain, more expected and many fields left flooded. But in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/09/environment-agency-to-boost-natural-flood-management-after-pilots">defence against flooding</a>, the alder tree can play a vital role, helping to soak up big rainfalls and slowing down the flow of water.<br /><br />Alder is a tree of wetlands that grows on riverbanks, fens, floodplains and marshes. It doesn’t rot in water – its wood hardens in water and can survive submerged for centuries – and much of Venice is built on alder piles driven into the silt of the lagoon. This was also a traditional wood used for building boats, sluice gates and shoring up riverbanks and canal banks.<br /><br />Alder is also a pioneer species, one of the first trees that recolonised Britain at the end of the last ice age, and its roots have nodules that are home to bacteria that capture nitrogen gas and so the tree helps to improve soil fertility. It can also absorb toxic heavy metals from the ground and helps restore waste industrial land.</p><p>But possibly its most famous use is in the bodies of upmarket electric guitars, best known in the Fender Stratocaster that Jimi Hendrix played at the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/17/woodstock-50th-anniversary-memories-looking-back">Woodstock music festival in 1969</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jan/18/wetland-woodstock-alder-plantwatch-hendrix-flood-defence">Continue reading...</a>

<p>What is it like to have a front row seat for the worst show in the world? Four meteorologists describe how they are explaining the reality to viewers – and coping with it themselves</p><p>Tuesday 19 July 2022 is a day that will stay with Ben Rich for ever. “I got up and immediately checked the weather observations to see what was going on,” he remembers. “Then I went to work for my shift. The station was really hot, the train was really hot, and I remember having this moment. I got a bit emotional about it, to be honest. I thought: this is huge. And if it can happen once, why can’t it happen again?”</p><p>That was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/19/day-of-40c-shocks-scientists-as-uk-heat-record-absolutely-obliterated">the day last year</a> when the temperature in the UK surpassed 40C (104F) for the first time ever. Rich is a BBC weather presenter and meteorologist. “In my training, which was only about 10 years ago, I was led to believe that 40C in the UK was nigh on impossible, because there are all sorts of factors that should stop that from happening, not least the fact that we are surrounded by ocean. It should be too moist for temperatures to get that high.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/outlook-terrifying-tv-weather-presenters-on-the-hell-and-horror-of-the-climate-crisis">Continue reading...</a>
