But this was no ordinary jail yard pigeon--this one was wearing what appeared to be a tiny backpack. </p><p>The officers cornered the bird and managed to get the tiny package off of it, which actually contained 30 grams of crystal meth. Meaning an inmate had to spend months training the pigeon to recognize their jail cell as its home so it could be used to smuggle drugs inside. </p><p>Not gonna lie, I'm fairly impressed by the creativity and dedication. Crystal meth? Very bad. But training a pigeon to be your best friend and even dodge security to bring you presents, albeit illegal ones? <em>Very</em> neat. </p><p>As bizarre as this story is, it's actually happened a few times in recent years. In 2017, a pigeon in Kuwait was caught carrying drugs near the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-iraq-ukraine" target="_blank">Iraq</a> border. In 2015, a pigeon was <a href="https://www.ibtimes.com/pigeon-caught-smuggling-drugs-costa-rican-prison-2055333" target="_blank">caught</a> smuggling drugs into a Costa Rica prison. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>The <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/female-prisoners-extra-jail-time" target="_blank">jail</a> system recently dealt with a similar drone problem. Drones were being used to deliver illicit substances and weapons to inmates. After the jail solved that issue, it seems prisoners took to more old-fashioned methods for getting their fix-- and by "old-fashioned," I mean reverting back to the Roman Empire. </p><p>Homing pigeons were once used to carry messages and parcels back and forth due to their navigation skills and ability to fly hundreds of miles per day. In 1903, a German apothecary used carrier pigeons to deliver much-needed medication. Pigeons were also used extensively during World Wars I and II for wartime messages. <a href="https://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2059858_2059863_2060209,00.html" target="_blank">One pigeon</a> was given an award for delivering 12 important messages for the U.S. Army Signal Corps despite being heavily injured. </p><p>And now, in the year of our Lord 2023, these incredible animals are being used to deliver hard drugs to incarcerated meth heads. It makes sense, honestly. </p><p><p>

## Ghislaine Maxwell hosts etiquette classes to teach other female inmates, quote, 'high moral standards'

That's according to the latest insane report <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/feeds/Miss%20Maxwell's%20message%20is,%20so%20what%20if%20you're%20a%20woman%20and%20a%20convicted%20felon,%20you're%20not%20a%20second%20class%20citizen.%20She's%20an%20unlikely%20role%20model%20but%20she's%20very%20passionate%20about%20this." target="_blank">from Daily Mail</a> on her adventures in the American penal (tee hee) system.</p><p>Maxwell is hosting twice weekly etiquette courses for forty of her fellow convicts. It's a four-week program that teaches the three pillars of etiquette: respect, consideration and honesty. Ghis, as I imagine her prison nickname to be, covers everything from proper dress to table manners to how to conduct yourself in a job interview.</p><p>She also cites her bestie Hillary Clinton as a powerful female figure who shattered glass ceilings. Before you flip over your desk, you'll want to read this quote:</p><blockquote>Miss Maxwell's message is, so what if you're a woman and a convicted felon, you're not a second class citizen. She's an unlikely role model but she's very passionate about this.</blockquote><p>NOTE: There is still no word about <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-maxwell-epstein" target="_self">Maxwell's client list</a> of <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ghislaine-maxwell-israel-adesanya" target="_self">powerful people she trafficked</a> underage girls for. We only know about Jeffrey Epstein. Who critics say, without evidence, didn't kill himself.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="e3cdd" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32648621&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Maxwell, at first, was quite put off by her new living arrangements upon arriving in Tallahassee. She refused to eat and didn't like her clothes. But she has since <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11412785/Ghislaine-Maxwell-seen-walking-galpal-cushy-regimen-Florida-prison-revealed.html" target="_blank">"taken up several fun new hobbies," "made friends" and "come out of her shell."</a></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="bb6f9" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32083754&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>She likes to play kickball and hula-hoop. But where she really shines? Checkers. She was selected for the over-40 prison checker team. I want to quote this directly because it's a thing of beauty.</p><blockquote>You want the best players and she has a reputation for being smart. The winning unit gets a really good meal, chicken wings, pizza, that sort of thing. It's much better than the usual food. It's a big deal. Nobody cares what you're in for so long as you win.</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ghislaine-maxwell-softball" target="_blank">Last month</a>, he heard Maxwell has become so obsessed with softball, the other prison inmates have given her the nickname "Dottie." You know, from that girl's baseball movie.</p><p>Prior to that, when <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ghislaine-maxwell-minimum-security" target="_self">Maxwell was moved to FCI Tallahassee</a>, she was provided the opportunity to learn a trade like an electrician, baker, horticulturist, plumber, or cosmologist.</p><p>Also, to pass the time, Maxwell is free to do pilates, lift weights, or play flag football and frisbee. She can also read a book in the recreational library. And she is able to continue teaching yoga.</p><p>It's good to see things are working out for her. It would be a shame if a convicted sex trafficker to a notorious pedophile (and his friends) was treated poorly by the United States penal (tee hee) system. </p><p>And now she's teaching other inmates to be just like her. Because of course she is.</p><p><p>

## Biden Admin considering ban on gas stoves because they're poisonous and raaaaacist. No, really. That's the reason.

This follows a study that found gas stoves are responsible for 12.7% of childhood asthma cases in the United States. The appliances are also reportedly tied to cardiovascular and respiratory issues and cancer. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>
<p>In December, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/watch-cory-booker-makes-wild-claims-about-border-security-and-the-holocaust" target="_blank">Senator Cory Booker</a> and twenty other Democrats wrote a <a href="https://www.booker.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/booker_beyer_lead_colleagues_in_urging_cpsc_to_address_dangerous_indoor_air_pollutions_emitted_by_gas_stoves.pdf" target="_blank">letter</a> to the CPSC asking them to crack down on gas stoves due to their disproportionate impact on minorities. That's right, grandma's old gas stove is not only poisonous- it's also <em>racist. </em>So basically, there's no other option than to indefinitely ban it from polite society. </p><p>Booker's letter about the racist stoves reads, in part, "<em>These emissions can create a cumulative burden to households that are already more likely to face higher exposure to both indoor and outdoor air pollution. Statistics show that Black, Latino, and low-income households are more likely to experience disproportionate air pollution, either from being more likely to be located near a waste incinerator or coal ash site, or living in smaller homes with poor ventilation, malfunctioning appliances, mold, dust mites, secondhand smoke, lead dust, pests, and other maintenance deficiencies."</em></p><p>After thoroughly dissecting that word salad, I concluded that this doesn't make a whole lot of sense. But the government said it, so it must be true. They're always looking out for us, like a Fairy Godmother, except with nukes. </p><p>In light of the dangers and political incorrectness of gas stoves, the CPSC may prevent the appliances from being produced and imported or create new regulations to reduce emissions. It's unclear at this time if Cory Booker will be deployed into American homes to forcefully remove existing criminal stoves, but Louder with Crowder dot com will be sure to keep you updated on any new developments.   </p><p><p>

## Watch: Lizzo absolutely crushes body-shamers in new 'beautiful' and 'brave' Instagram post

Artists are here to make art, and this body is art."</p><blockquote class="instagram-media">

</div>
</blockquote><p>Last year, Lizzo said she considers herself a "body icon" and is creating her own body standard. This is where the problem starts with all this "body positivity" nonsense. There's nothing wrong with a larger person not wanting to constantly hate and shame themselves. That's not a healthy mindset for anyone to have. But it's also not healthy for any person to be this overweight or obese, and Lizzo promoting it as a "new beauty standard" spreads the wrong message to American women. </p><p>Unfortunately at this point, "body positivity" seems here to stay, at least for a while. It's estimated by 2030 50% of Americans will be obese. Although, maybe by then, those numbers will come down as a result of our state-enforced bug diets. </p><p>Lizzo actually had another hot take just yesterday. Apparently,  "canceling" people is now appropriating it from marginalized communities who have the supreme cancelation authority. </p><p>She tweeted, "Cancel culture is appropriation. There was real outrage from truly marginalized people and now it’s become trendy, misused and misdirected."</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cThis may be a random time to say this but it\u2019s on my heart.. cancel culture is appropriation. \n\nThere was real outrage from truly marginalized people and now it\u2019s become trendy, misused and misdirected.  \n\nI hope we can phase out of this & focus our outrage on the real problems.\u201d</div> — FOLLOW @YITTY (@FOLLOW @YITTY)

</blockquote>
<p>It is quite delicious to see all the woke-isms gradually cannibalize each other. And this new theory may come in handy for all the "body shamers" that will have to be canceled by Lizzo in our increasingly pro-fat empire. </p><p>Last year, Lizzo was actually <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lizzo-disabled-activists-spaz" target="_blank">canceled</a> by disabled activists for her use of the word "spaz" in a song. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cHey @lizzo my disability Cerebral Palsy is literally classified as Spastic Diplegia (where spasticity refers to unending painful tightness in my legs) your new song makes me pretty angry + sad. \u2018Spaz\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean freaked out or crazy. It\u2019s an ableist slur. It\u2019s 2022. Do better.\u201d</div> — Hannah Diviney (@Hannah Diviney)

</blockquote>
<p>Lizzo ended up caving to the culturally-appropriating disabled mob and changed the lyrics of her song to avoid the extremely offensive term, explaining, "as a fat black woman in America, I've had so many hurtful words used against me so I overstated the power words can have." </p><p><p>

<p>The United States and New Zealand are the <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/medications/do-not-get-sold-on-drug-advertising" target="_blank">only</a> countries that allow drug makers to market their products directly to consumers.

Before all this SCHMOVID nonsense began, most Americans probably wouldn't even have known the company by name. Pfizer roughly doubled its revenue from 2020-2021, and its SCHMOVID vaccine held 70% of the United States and European markets. Before the pandemic, its top sellers were a pneumonia vaccine, a cancer drug, and a fibromyalgia treatment. </p><p>But disregard all of that, because as our fearless President told us, we actually <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/sep/21/biden-big-pharma-senior-voters-midterms" target="_blank">BEAT</a> Big Pharma this year!
