<p>When you <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1072047/best-ultraportable-laptops.html">buy an ultraportable laptop</a>, you sacrifice battery life. It&rsquo;s just a matter of physics. With a smaller frame comes less space for parts, and that includes a battery. Unless you&rsquo;re buying the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.msi.com/Business-Productivity/Prestige-13-Evo-A13MX&amp;xcust=2-3-1450124-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">MSI Prestige 13 Evo</a>, just unveiled at CES 2023. As our Gordon Mah Ung demonstrates, MSI is casting some kind of voodoo to defy the laws of physics, and cram a 75 watt-hour battery into a laptop that weighs just 990 grams (2.2 pounds). </p>

<p>For the sake of comparison, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1355530/dell-xps-13-9315-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">the latest Dell XPS 13</a> weighs 2.6 pounds, and only manages a 51-Wh battery. And one of the smaller laptops that DOES pack a similar-sized battery, the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/search?q=g14+asus#gsc.tab=0&amp;gsc.q=g14%20asus&amp;gsc.page=1" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Asus Zephyrus G14</a>, is almost four pounds. In short, this is some impressive engineering on the part of MSI, thanks to shaving every possible gram off of the rest of the parts, as seen in the video. </p>



<p>The MSI Prestige 13 will go on sale in March starting at around $1300, with 13th-gen Intel processors and Xe graphics.

## Gigabyte’s 2023 laptops ooze class (and ports)

<p>If you like rear-mounted laptop ports and prefer USB-C charging to a proprietary barrel charger, then Gigabyte may have what you&rsquo;re looking for in 2023.</p>



<p>At CES 2023, we had a chance to check out Gigabyte&rsquo;s upcoming laptop lineup, beginning with the Aero 14 OLED and extending through to the Aero 16 OLED, and Gigabyte&rsquo;s two gaming laptops, the Aorus 17X and 15X. </p>



<p>Remember, the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/697068/usb-c-cables-can-now-charge-the-most-powerful-gaming-laptops.html">USB-C power delivery (PD) standard has increased to 240 watts</a>, and that has opened up new avenues for laptop makers to improve their products. The Aero 14 OLED only requires a 130W charger, but that doesn&rsquo;t have to necessarily provided by Gigabyte, either &mdash; any new charger that supports the power standard will do. (So far, Gigabyte and other laptop manufacturers seem committed to shipping those chargers alongside those laptops, unlike some smartphone manufacturers. Let&rsquo;s hope that continues.) But that <em>also</em> includes a discrete Nvidia GeForce RTX 4000 GPU option as well as a 13th-gen Intel CPU, all with a &ldquo;standard&rdquo; USB-C charger.</p>



<p>Hey, as executive editor Gordon Mah Ung notes, &ldquo;I would probably trade my normal laptop for something this classy.&rdquo;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>We&rsquo;d be remiss if we didn&rsquo;t point out some improvements Gigabyte has made as well. Sure, there are Thunderbolt 4 ports mounted along the side of the chassis, but there are also USB-C and HDMI ports mounted on the rear of the chassis. That can be a little awkward when it comes to actually inserting the cable, but far more convenient during the other 99.99999 percent of the time, when you&rsquo;re actually <em>using </em>it. And yes, white keyboards are a plus!</p>



<p>We&rsquo;re also continuing to see the trend of more and more OLED panels manifest themselves within the Aero lineup, though the new Aorus gaming laptops appear to have stuck with other display technologies instead to achieve the high refresh rates. But the now-standard RGB lighting is splashed all over Gigabyte&rsquo;s new laptops, too.</p>



<p>Did any of Gigabyte&rsquo;s laptops make our list of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1448388/10-best-laptops-from-ces-2023.html">best laptops of CES 2023</a>?

## Razer’s revamped Blade laptops are bigger and more beautiful than ever

<p>Razer&rsquo;s Blade series of laptops have been a favorite of gamers ever since they were introduced over a decade ago. The company generally improves the models gently, but this year they&rsquo;ve got a few big changes. Gordon Mah Ung is live on the CES 2023 show floor to walk you through the improvements, including two Razer firsts: an <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.razer.com/gaming-laptops/razer-blade-18&amp;xcust=2-1-1450041-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">18-inch screen</a> and a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.razer.com/gaming-laptops/razer-blade-16&amp;xcust=2-1-1450041-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">glorious mini-LED screen panel.</a> </p>



<p>For the uninitiated, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/560224/oled-vs-mini-led-the-pc-displays-of-the-future-compared.html">mini-LED is an alternative to OLED</a>, and Razer says the Blade 16&rsquo;s luscious mini-LED panel is the first one ever to go into a 16-inch laptop. (A lot of qualifiers there, but I guess you&rsquo;ve got to fill your press release with something.) The panel offers some interesting flexibility: it can run at 2560&times;1600 and 120Hz, or 1920&times;1200 and 240Hz. That lets players dynamically adjust their sharpness and smoothness based on what&rsquo;s necessary in the current game. An immersive single-player game obviously benefits from better resolution, but a competitive shooter demands those extra frames. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Perhaps a more obvious upgrade is the new Blade 18, Razer&rsquo;s largest gaming laptop ever &mdash; a hair bigger than the 17.3-inch models seen previously. Razer is billing this as the &ldquo;ultimate desktop replacement.&rdquo; While it doesn&rsquo;t get the fancy mini-LED display, it does have full-power access to its guts, running the GPU at up to 175 total graphics power (TGP). </p>



<p>Both the Blade 16 and Blade 18 can be configured with the latest and greatest internals, including a Core i9-13950HX 24-core processor and an RTX 4090 graphics card. They&rsquo;ll be going on sale in the first quarter of this year for $2700 and $2900, respectively.

## We benchmarked Intel’s Core i9-13980HX. It blows away Apple’s M1 Max

<p>What do you value more? New laptop CPU benchmarks or a look at some of the laptops they&rsquo;ll be built into? At CES, MSI offered both.</p>



<p>At CES, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1435904/intel-launches-13th-gen-mobile-core-chips-with-endurance-gaming.html">Intel debuted its 13th-gen Core chips for laptops</a>, code-named Raptor Lake, including the powerhouse Core i9-13980HX.  We always know a little about how new Intel chips will perform, complements of Intel: about 12 percent faster in gaming, for example. But <em>live</em> benchmarks usually have to wait for actual shipping laptops to hit our test bench. Not this year. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Further reading: </strong><em><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1447954/best-of-ces-2023-the-most-intriguing-and-innovative-pc-hardware.html">Best of CES 2023: The most intriguing and innovative PC hardware</a></em></p></blockquote>



<p>MSI showed us both the Titan GT77 HX &mdash; with Intel&rsquo;s top-of-the-line Core i9-13980HX processor inside &mdash; as well as the Raider GE78 HX in the company&rsquo;s booth at CES 2023. The company was gracious enough to let us show off two benchmarks: CrystalDiskMark, which measures the actually performance of the PCI Express 5 SSD inside of it, and then Cinebench, which allowed us to take the first look at exactly how fast Intel&rsquo;s latest mobile processors run. How fast is it? You&rsquo;ll have to watch to find out, but spoiler alert: It blows away Apple&rsquo;s latest processor by a <em>ton</em>.</p>

<p>MSI also allowed us to explore the other laptops it will be shipping in 2023. If you grew up in the 1980s as Gordon did, you&rsquo;ll certainly appreciate the Lite Brite LEDs that MSI is building into the front of its laptops. You&rsquo;ll have to check out the Raider GE78 HX, the Raider GE68 HX, and then the &ldquo;gaming laptops that do not look like gaming laptops:&rdquo; the Stealth 16 Studio, Stealth 14, and the Cyborg 14. MSI has gone all out with translucent chassis and some unique badging options, and our video shows them all off.  We have prices, ship dates, specs and more. </p>

## Kingslim D4 dash cam review: 4K front with backup assist, weak captures

<p>Kingslim (a brand of Akaso) sent us one of several dash cams it sells on Amazon, the $120 (on sale) dual-channel D4. It is a bit unusual in that the second camera may be used inside the cabin as a rear camera, or above the license plate as a backup camera. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Note: This review is part of our ongoing roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/428348/best-dash-cam-reviews.html">best dash cams</a>. Go there to learn more about competing products, what to look for in a dash cam, and buying recommendations.</em></p></blockquote>



<h2 id="kingslim-d4-design-and-features">Kingslim D4: Design and features</h2>



<p>The D4 consists of a 170 degree field-of-view, 4K UHD (3840&times;2160) front camera and a 120 degree FOV, 1080p cable-connected rear camera that&rsquo;s also used for backup assist&mdash;depending on where you mount it and wire it.</p>



<p>The main camera body is slim and minimalist in terms of buttons. That&rsquo;s what a touch-enabled colorful, 640&times;480, 3-inch display allows you to do. Unusually, the mini-USB power port (one of two) and TF card slots are hidden under a captive rubberized plug on the left side (as you look at the display). Situated directly above it is the power button&mdash;the only physical control available.</p>



<p>Power is supplied from an auxiliary (cigarette lighter) cable, which normally you&rsquo;ll connect via the second mini-USB port in the included GPS sticky (semi-permanent adhesive) mount. At least if you want to power the GPS, which is in the mount. The main camera snaps onto the mount, which is adjustable vertically, but not horizontally. Be careful when you align it.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1440763" height="829" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Kingslim-D4-app-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The Kingslim app is simple but effective, allowing you to see a live view,  offload video, and tweak most settings.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The app shown above (three screenshots combined) lets you offload videos from the camera, as well as tweak various settings. However, not all settings are accounted for&mdash;most notably GPS, which proved a tad cantankerous. Also, while I thought pressing the app&rsquo;s record button would record directly to the phone, apparently it was still recorded to the SD card.</p>



<p>Other features include a parking mode and a 280mAh battery for almost 3 minutes of run time once the AC is lifted.</p>



<h2 id="kingslim-d4-installation">Kingslim D4: Installation</h2>



<p>By choosing a dash-cam combo that includes a backup camera, you&rsquo;re asking for a more complicated install. For the backup function to operate properly, the backup camera needs to be installed over the license plate using the supplied screws or sticky pads. Cable routing is more of an issue than with interior rear view cameras.</p>



<p>Normally, you can run the wire in through the housing for the license plate light, but it must then be routed all the way to the main camera, with the second red wire attached to the backup lights. Power (when you&rsquo;re in reverse) through the red cable tells the main camera to go into backup mode. It&rsquo;s not rocket science, but it takes time, patience, and discovering the best cable path.</p>



<p>If you want to install the backup camera inside as a simple rear-view camera, then you&rsquo;ll need to use the supplied sticky pads to affix it to the rear window. You could also screw it to the rear deck but you&rsquo;ll need to to detach the mount and rotate it 180 degrees so the video won&rsquo;t be upside down. </p>



<p>All this is standard for a backup camera. Just be sure that&rsquo;s what you want before purchasing the D4.</p>



<h2 id="kingslim-d4-capture-performance">Kingslim D4: Capture performance</h2>



<p>It&rsquo;s not often that I see a front camera that&rsquo;s better in low-light conditions, but the D4 is that. Night captures without my headlights on or oncoming traffic were the best of a rather mediocre lot. That makes it a decent camera for your car when it&rsquo;s parked. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1437086" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Kingslim-D4-front-night-no-headlights.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The  D4&rsquo;s captures were only better than passable in low-light conditions, and you can see that headlights and  taillights are a problem even in this capture.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>During the day, or at night with headlights involved&mdash;not so much. There was a surprising lack of detail (as you can see in the signs) from day captures, and the minute I switched my headlights on at night&mdash;an act that generally improves captures greatly&mdash;detail fled the image. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1437087" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Kingslim-D4-front-day.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>It&rsquo;s been a long time since I&rsquo;ve seen a camera that handled bright conditions this poorly. Normally, these parking signs are easy to read.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The above image is exceedingly poor for 4K UHD, proving that processing is every bit as important as hardware and resolution. The sensor is a Sony EXMOR IMX335, which is capable of delivering far better results than this. </p>



<p>You can see that the D4 is a having a difficult time handling bright areas but there was no white-level or exposure settings that I could find to ameliorate the issue. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1437088" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Kingslim-D4-front-night-headlights.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Turning on my own headlights made the letters in the sign almost indecipherable&mdash;the exact opposite of what usually occurs.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The daytime rear capture with the camera on top of the license plate. Sorry about the human obstruction to the right. As you can see, the view suffers a bit of fisheye despite an only 120-degree field of view. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1437089" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Kingslim-D4-rear-day.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>This partially blocked rear capture is merely okay. It appears slightly overexposed, no doubt due to the poor processing. </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Rear night captures blurred to the point where they have an otherworldly look to them. Good luck reading license plate numbers. All the light areas you see are amplified far beyond what was actually viewable to the naked eye. Perhaps good for surveillance, but not fine detail.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1437091" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Kingslim-D4-rear-night.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>You&rsquo;d  probably never guess this was a 1080p capture. It has more the aspect of 480p in terms of  detail and blockiness.  This is actually far brighter overall than were the conditions. This obsession with making everything bright might be the issue. </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The GPS kicked in, and showed a strong signal, but took quite a while to initialize. Alas, it also failed to embed in the video, as you can see in the screen cap below. Either that, or the app failed to read it. Note the g-sensor grid below the main image. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1440592" height="855" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-20-at-9.17.33-AM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The GPS info in the D4 was either never embedded into the video or there might also have been an issue reading  it with the player.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>I was expecting far better capture results from the D4 given it&rsquo;s 4K UHD/1080p resolution and high-end touch display. As I said earlier, you can&rsquo;t always judge a product from its specs. The GPS not-embedding issue was also annoying and didn&rsquo;t help the overall rating. It will likely be fixed in the near future, but as of now remains a problem. </p>



<p>Not to pile on, but there were numerous other small glitches that affected my overall opinion that the D4 is a product that could use some fine-tuning and TLC. </p>



<h2 id="should-you-buy-the-kingslim-d4">Should you buy the Kingslim D4?</h2>



<p>Sadly, despite the comprehensive list of features and abilities, including the touch screen and enticingly low price, I can&rsquo;t recommend the D4. Even if the GPS had embedded/displayed properly, the capture quality simply isn&rsquo;t up to snuff. Spend a bit more and be happier in the long run.</p>

<p>Sayonara pint-sized portables. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1445432/youre-going-to-need-a-bigger-backpack-laptops-are-large-and-in-charge-at-ces-2023.html">Powerful laptops are large and in charge at CES 2023</a>, fueled by beastly new desktop-like Intel Core HX and Nvidia GeForce RTX 40-series chips&mdash;but taming those monstrous components usually requires massive designs loaded with cooling technology. Not <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blog.cyberpowerpc.com/2023/01/04/ces-2023-upcoming-cyberpowerpc-products/&amp;xcust=2-1-1449774-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">CyberPowerPC&rsquo;s new Tracer VII gaming laptops</a>. These eye-catching new pieces of kit make their ultra-fast parts run even faster with an assist from external liquid-cooling.</p>



<p>At first blush, the CyberPowerPC Tracer VII Edge I16G (with a 16-inch, 240Hz IPS display) and Edge I17E (with a 16:10, 240Hz 17-inch panel) look like clean, unassuming gaming laptops. Their simple black exteriors hide the latest high-end components, like Intel&rsquo;s Core i9-13900HX and Nvidia&rsquo;s GeForce RTX 4090. That&rsquo;s impressive enough already but the real draw here, in mullet-like fashion, is the party going on in the back.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>These laptops include hose ports in the rear that connect to an optional &ldquo;optional detachable liquid cooling add-on unit&rdquo; that packs the usual radiator, pump, and fan you&rsquo;d see in a desktop AIO cooler. As you can see in the video, plugging and unplugging the unit is incredibly simple. A small bit of liquid can be left around the ports after disconnection, but CyberPowerPC smartly included a port at the top of the cooler that can be used to top it off with (presumably) distilled water, with the water levels visible on the side of the box.</p>



<p>Why would you even want to liquid cool a laptop to begin with? It&rsquo;s all about the unprecedented, mammoth levels of power unlocked by Intel and Nvidia&rsquo;s latest chips. Gordon Mah Ung explains:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&ldquo;Having water-cooling in a laptop is going to make a <em>huge</em> difference with these new CPUs that are so fast, with these new GPUs that are so fast and also very hot. Dealing with thermals in laptops is the biggest challenge. Adding this auxiliary cooling when you need it should make a very huge difference in any gaming laptop. I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of gaming laptop reviews and let me tell you: the ones that are bigger and better cooled are faster. This lets you get really good performance out of laptops that aren&rsquo;t as huge.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>



<p>Cyberpower isn&rsquo;t saying how much of a performance bump you get when the optional liquid cooler is connected, nor how much the accessory will cost. These ferociously capable laptops won&rsquo;t come cheap though: The 16-inch Tracer VII Edge I16G will cost about $2,800 when it launches, while the larger Edge I17E will debut at around $3,000. Look for both to hit the streets in early February.</p>

<p>Remote-desktop software may still seem like science fiction to the family member or customer trying to overcome a computer issue, but real heads know it&rsquo;s been a useful reality for a while now. Using the remote-desktop software allows you to diagnose, operate, and fix another computer over a long distance. And while the technology is no longer sci-fi, faster networking and broadband has made the experience much faster and more enjoyable for both yourself and those you&rsquo;re trying to help. While not exactly the same, it&rsquo;s as close as you can get to being there in person.</p>



<p>In addition to allowing you to help a family member or business associate with their computer problems, it&rsquo;s a handy way to access your own various work or home systems remotely. Use cases and needs for remote-desktop software vary widely. That&rsquo;s why we have included recommendations for everything from occasional use to full business suites and everything in-between. The team at PCWorld has spent many hours testing and reviewing these products and our picks will help lead you to the best remote-desktop software for your purposes.</p>



<p><em>*Note that a server is the software on the computer to be controlled, and a client is the program that does the controlling.</em></p>

<p>TeamViewer is easy, free for personal/occasional use, and has all the remote-desktop software extras such as chat functionality, support for file transfers, and multiple-display support. Those features separate it from our other choice freebie&mdash;Chrome Remote Desktop. TeamViewer is also exceedingly friendly to new users/helpees with a &ldquo;portable&rdquo; mode that eliminates the need for installation. The only thing that keeps TeamViewer from being an unequivocal recommendation as a free option is that if you use it more than occasionally you will get pestered with messages essentially reminding you not to abuse the privilege. For the occasional use though, TeamViewer&rsquo;s free option can&rsquo;t be beat. </p>

<p>TeamViewer is laudable as a licensed business option for all the reasons mentioned above, as well as the additional support for Zoom meetings and video help; but in that regard, there are less pricey options.</p>

<p>Fast and free, Chrome Remote Desktop is available on any operating system that supports the Chrome browser, including, of course, Chrome OS. Android and iOS are also taken care of so you can control computers using your phone. CRD supports both unattended access and one-off screen sharing sessions. It also supports file transfers, but lacks a chat function and support for multiple displays, so it&rsquo;s not a great option for pros who are supporting a number of different users and need more flexibility. </p>

<p>When it comes to remote-desktop software for controlling a number of business PCs, you will most likely to have to pay for a license, save for this specific scenario: The computers you want to control are all running either the Pro or Enterprise versions of Windows. The device you are using to control those machines can be running any version of Windows, macOS, Android, or iOS. If that describes your needs, Windows Remote Desktop Connection is a worthy option. </p>

<p>It requires some technical chops to configure the router and firewall properly&mdash;something any IT pro should have no problem with. The results are speedy performance, thanks to its peer-to-peer connections, and a capable, if basic feature set. You don&rsquo;t get chat, and can only transfer files Windows-to-Windows, but if saving money is your goal, this is a great way to remotely control Windows computers for free.</p>

<p>We weren&rsquo;t necessarily looking for a new option in this category. Our previous pick for business, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/628880/vnc-connect-remote-control-software-review-affordable-cross-platform-with-a-vengeance.html">VNC Connect</a>, was plenty versatile, with robust features.

But now along comes RemotePC, which is less expensive still, while offering the same full package of features, such as multi-monitor support, drag-and-drop file transfers, screen recording, whiteboarding, remote sound and printing, and other conveniences. </p>

<p>There are servers for all the major desktop OSes, as well as Android. Yes, with RemotePC you can access, say, a missing Android phone or tablet from afar. Nifty. Add to that the potential for easy integration with iDrive&rsquo;s backup services (for an added fee), and you can see why we felt compelled to name a new business champ.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-look-for-in-remote-desktop-software">What to look for in remote desktop software</h2>



<p>All remote desktop software works the same way. It captures input from your computer, transfers it to the target computer, which returns information about the results, including the state of the user interface&mdash;i.e., you can see the remote desktop. The protocols involved include RDS/RDP for Windows, Chromoting for Chrome Remote Desktop, VNC/RFB for VNC, etc. The names vary, as do their origins, but the all work as described.</p>



<p>Which remote desktop program you choose generally comes down to which operating systems and devices you&rsquo;re using, how much you&rsquo;ll be using it, price, and features. </p>



<p><strong>Operating system/device support:</strong> The remote desktop software you choose needs to have clients (for controlling) and servers (for being controlled) for all the computers or devices you want to employ. E.g., if you want to control a Windows PC from an iPhone, there needs to be a sever for the PC and a client for iOS.</p>



<p><strong>Ease of installation and use:</strong> If you&rsquo;re dealing with less-savvy users on the other end of the connection, never underestimate the value of intuitive and easy. If you haven&rsquo;t already installed the software on the remote machine, it can be a daunting task for the helpee. Reviews or a hands-on test drive can let you know how trouble-free the process will be. </p>



<p><strong>Price</strong>: Some solutions are free, some require a license fee. The latter tend to have more features and encompass a wider variety of platforms, though this is not an absolute. Tech support is generally only available if you pay for it, as well. We suggest that end users start off free, and if it&rsquo;s not getting the job done, explore the pay options. </p>



<p><strong>Features</strong>: Capabilities such as chat, file transfer, portal-based setup (avoiding router and network hassles), support for computers running multiple displays, etc. are obviously factors if you need them. Again, start off free and see how it goes, then spend the money according the dictates of your needs.</p>



<h2 id="how-we-test-remote-desktop-software">How we test remote desktop software</h2>



<p>We test all the software both over a local network and the internet. Virtual machines on both the local and remote computers are employed to test alternate operating systems such as Linux. If mobile clients are available, we test them on a Google Pixel 4 (Android) and an Apple iPad (iOS). We control the remote machine, transfer files, check out the chat function and any other features that are available. </p>



<p>A very important criteria is speed, i.e., how nimble the remote operating system feels, and how fast files transfer. With the increased speed and bandwidth most users have access to today, remote internet performance isn&rsquo;t the issue it was back in the days of dial-up, DSL, etc. That said, there can be noticeable differences. </p>



<p>Remote-desktop software such as TeamViewer will establish a connection using the company&rsquo;s web portal, then gets out of the way to allow traffic to flow directly from machine to machine. Others such as GoToMyPC route all traffic through their portal. This has some advantages if you&rsquo;re using a web browser to view the remote PC, but can slow things down otherwise&mdash;especially on local network connections. Windows Remote Desktop Connection and Apple Remote Desktop are peer-to-peer by nature. This allows good performance both locally and across the internet, but requires configuring firewalls and routers for the latter.  </p>



<p>The other major consideration we evaluate is how intuitive and easy the software is to set up and use. In most cases, we use less tech-savvy family and friends as guinea pigs. Sorry, folks!</p>

<p>First you will need remote access software, such as one of the recommendations above. Once you have completed the setup on both the controlling computer and the remote computer you wish to access, it&rsquo;s as simple as selecting the computer you wish to remotely log into and then hitting connect.</p>



<p>Some remote desktop software such as Chrome Remote Desktop utilize an application on your mobile device that you open and select the remote desktop you wish to connect to via an internet connection. Others, such as TeamViewer require you to install remote access software on the computer you wish to connect to and work via their program.</p>



<p>Either way, you will be required to gain permission and most likely enter a password in order to log in to the remote access desktop.</p>

<p>There are a number of reasons to use a remote desktop such as the ability to easily monitor and maintain many devices connected to a network, allow access to files on connected devices, and cheaper data security, among others. But by far the most popular usage of remote desktop is to assist with IT and computer issues from afar. Being able to assist coworkers, friends, and family with their tech problems is made infinitely easier via remote desktop than waiting until you visit your parents or relatives over the holidays.</p>

<p>A remote desktop is a program that allows you to connect to a different physical computer somewhere else and interact with its desktop as if you were actually in front of that computer itself.</p>



<p>Without getting too technical, a virtual desktop is a program running on a computer that mimics the operation of a different computer or operating system&mdash;a pretend computer if you will. It is an image of a preconfigured operating system with applications, files, etc. that is separate from the original end device or computer and is typically run via cloud or through a host server.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re on the prowl for serious graphics power, the Lenovo Legion 5i Gaming is definitely worth considering. It has an Intel Core i7-12700H CPU, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of NVMe PCIe SSD storage. That&rsquo;s powerful enough to run most games on high or ultra graphics. The 15.6-inch display is roomy and has a resolution of 1920&times;1080 as well as a refresh rate of 165Hz.  It&rsquo;s also G-Sync compatible, which helps with any screen tearing or stuttering issues. This is an awesome deal. Availability is limited, though, so you&rsquo;ll need to act fast.</p>

<h2 class="toc" id="laptop-deal-buying-tips">Laptop deal buying tips</h2>



<p>If you&rsquo;ve shopped online before for laptop deals you&rsquo;re probably aware that there&rsquo;s a vast range of laptop configurations available. </p>



<p>A good place to start is with the processor. Buy laptops with Intel <strong>11</strong>-series Core chips or higher, such as the Core i5-<strong>11</strong>510U, or the Core i7-<strong>12</strong>800H; or go with an AMD Ryzen processor (but <em>not</em> an AMD Athlon or A-series chip). Avoid laptops with Pentium or Celeron processors unless it&rsquo;s a Chromebook (running Chrome OS). You&rsquo;re going to need to pay attention with gaming laptops, too, as some GPUs, like the RTX 3050 Ti, don&rsquo;t offer much boost over their RTX 2xxx-series cousins, and Nvidia has dropped the Max-Q designation on certain low-power options. Our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/551001/buying-a-laptop-look-for-pcs-with-these-cpus-and-gpus.html">laptop CPU and GPU cheat sheet</a> can help you shop smart. </p>



<p>Display resolution is a gotcha. If you see a laptop labeled as &ldquo;HD&rdquo; resolution that means 1366-by-768 and often isn&rsquo;t worth your time for a laptop under 13 inches unless the deal is absolutely standout. What you want is &ldquo;Full HD&rdquo; or &ldquo;FHD,&rdquo; which means 1080p. </p>



<p>Don&rsquo;t buy <em>laptops</em> with under 4GB of RAM or 128GB of SSD storage&mdash;though on a Chromebook, this configuration is acceptable. We have more explanation in our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/402141/chromebooks-versus-windows-laptops-which-should-you-buy.html">laptops versus Chromebooks buying guide</a>, as well as in our primer on <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/549407/how-to-buy-a-budget-laptop-without-getting-screwed.html">how to buy a budget laptop without getting screwed</a>. Also watch out for eMMC storage, which is something we don&rsquo;t recommend for a Windows laptop but works fine for a Chromebook.</p>



<p>Reviews can be helpful. Even if you can&rsquo;t find a review of a specific configuration, try related models. They&rsquo;ll often give you a good idea of the build quality and performance. Also buy from brands you trust. Amazon&rsquo;s daily laptop deals right now are full of brands we&rsquo;ve never tested or talked to (Broage, Teclast, DaySky, Jumper) and it&rsquo;s just a good idea to be wary.</p>



<p>Most older laptops will run Windows 10, and that&rsquo;s fine&mdash;there&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/539089/why-we-recommend-you-skip-windows-11-for-now.html">no rush to upgrade</a>. Windows 10 in S Mode, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407161/windows-10-s-review.html">though annoying</a>, can be <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406654/how-upgrading-from-windows-10-s-to-windows-10-pro-could-cost-you.html">switched out of easily</a> if you find it on a budget laptop.

## Fake ‘Pokemon NFT’ game infects PCs with malware

<p>PC gamers have been waiting a Growlithe&rsquo;s age to get a real <em>Pokemon </em>game, with naught but the likes of <em>Temtem </em>and <em>Monster Crown</em> to hold them over. But no matter how desperate you are to catch &rsquo;em all on your desktop, resist the urge to download sketchy executables from sketchy sites&hellip;especially if they&rsquo;re using the questionable allure of NFTs to sucker you in. At least two have been spotted spreading remote access malware to players who want to be the very best. </p>



<p>Security researchers at <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/45312/&amp;xcust=2-1-1449634-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ASEC</a> (via <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-push-fake-pokemon-nft-game-to-take-over-windows-devices/&amp;xcust=2-1-1449634-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bleeping Computer</a>) spotted two different <em>Pokemon</em>-themed websites inviting would-be Ash Ketchums to download executables for a digital version of the card game, only to install malware hidden behind the legitimate NetSupport Manager tool. Once installed, the Team Rocket-style malefactors could seize control of an infected PC with basic remote support tools, installing other malicious software and stealing user data at their leisure. </p>



<p>Distributing fake versions of popular games in order to seed malicious programs is nothing new, but suckering in players with the promise of profits from Pokemon-branded NFTs is particularly naughty. Not only has there been no indication that Nintendo or <em>Pokemon </em>developer Game Freak are interested in jumping on the non-fungible bandwagon, NFTs themselves are rife with pump-and-dump investment shenanigans and good old-fashioned theft. The <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ftx-nft-nonfungible-token-crypto-prices-bored-ape/&amp;xcust=2-1-1449634-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">bottom dropped out of the NFT market</a> last year. </p>



<p>ASEC reported two separate URLs that hosted convincing fake presentations and PC downloads, with &ldquo;pokemon-go&rdquo; and &ldquo;beta-pokemoncards&rdquo; in their URLs. At the time of writing, both have been taken down. We&rsquo;ll remind readers that while there&rsquo;s no official version of the Pokemon RPGs available on any non-Nintendo device, and certainly no universe in which the Pokemon franchise is infected with NFT nonsense, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-tcg/play-online&amp;xcust=2-1-1449634-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">there is a real PC version of the Pokemon Trading Card Game</a> you can download and play for free. </p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking to get one of AMD&rsquo;s new Ryzen 7000 CPUs and want to maximize it, you may also want a premium motherboard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enter the MSI MEG X670E Ace. Underlying its sleek but imposing aesthetics, you&rsquo;ll find a hearty offering of features: 10GbE LAN, PCIe Gen 5, and plenty of M.2 slots. This motherboard is geared towards the enthusiast gamer and content creator. Does this &ldquo;Ace&rdquo; truly deliver?&nbsp;</p>



<p>We will comb the specs, and discuss features, performance, and design aesthetics. If you&rsquo;re building a high-end enthusiast-grade desktop with the fastest Ryzen 7000 CPUs, is this the motherboard of choice over its competitors? Let&rsquo;s find out!</p>



<h2 id="msi-meg-x670e-ace-the-specs">MSI MEG X670E Ace: The specs</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI MEG X670E ACE" class="wp-image-1446850" height="722" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2022-11-28-at-1.07.42-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>The MSI MEG X670E Ace is serious business, starting with AM5 support&mdash;you&rsquo;ll need a new AMD CPU such as the Ryzen 9 7950X. The good news is that you&rsquo;ll be able to use your old AM4 cooler, if it uses the original AMD backplate&mdash;otherwise you&rsquo;ll need a new AM5-specific version.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The board is E-ATX, meaning it will be larger than your typical ATX motherboard, with measurements of 277&times;304.8mm (10.9&times;12 inches), so case size will be important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PCIe Gen 5 and DDR5 are here, not to mention a long list of great I/O, such a 10GbE LAN, and multiple USB ports.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The unboxing experience is good, and for an MSRP of $699, it does come with a few interesting accessories: an M.2 Xpander-Z PCIe Gen 5 card, a USB drive, a few cable stickers, and the usual cables. No fancy box like we saw with the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1421913/asrock-x670e-taichi-gaming-motherboard-review.html">$499 X670E Asrock Taichi</a>, but that&rsquo;s not too relevant. (Sorry, box enthusiasts!)</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI MEG X670E ACE" class="wp-image-1446854" height="723" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2022-11-28-at-1.08.52-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>

<h2 id="msi-meg-x670e-ace-features">MSI MEG X670E Ace: Features</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI MEG X670E ACE" class="wp-image-1446856" height="924" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2022-12-26-at-1.08.13-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The MSI MEG X670E Ace comes complete with an M.2 Xpander-Z card.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>Coming in at $699, this is an enthusiast-grade, premium motherboard. The X670E chipset means that it will have the most robust PCIe Gen 5 support you&rsquo;ll find for AM5, and that shows: Three 16x PCIe Gen 5 lanes (split 8x/8x/4x if you use all three) means you can add PCIe cards alongside your next-generation GPU.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lucky for you, MSI includes an Xpander-Z PCIe Gen 5 M.2 card for that very purpose! If the four onboard M.2 slots weren&rsquo;t enough (with one being PCIe Gen 5), you can augment an additional two on the card itself. While most gamers may not need six M.2 drives, heavy-usage content creators will love this (plus six SATA ports, as well).</p>



<p>MSI also makes those M.2 slots &ldquo;screwless,&rdquo; which is a bonus feature for those who don&rsquo;t like miniscule screws! Along with the integrated I/O shield, this helps make for an enjoyable build experience.</p>



<p>USB ports are plentiful here, with 11 on the rear, including USB 3.2 Gen 2 at 20Gb/s. USB 4 is not included here, which is a shame considering the price point. Other competitors such as the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1385986/asus-rog-crosshair-x670e-hero-motherboard-review.html">Asus ROG X670E Hero</a> do have USB4.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To compensate, MSI does give you 10GbE LAN, which content creators will appreciate for NAS or other robust networking setups. Still, USB4 would be a nice premium feature here for that same crowd, too. Wi-Fi 6E with an included antenna is an expected&mdash;and included&mdash;accessory at this price point.</p>



<p>Audio is great, with Realtek&rsquo;s ALC 4082 codec and ESS ES92280AQ combo DAC. You&rsquo;ll also get a headphone amp for running higher-impedance cans. This is fantastic audio for those who don&rsquo;t want additional peripherals and prefer to keep it streamlined within the motherboard itself.</p>



<p>Clear CMOS and BIOS Flash buttons are included, as well as a &ldquo;smart button.&rdquo;&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll also get a debug LED, which is helpful, but at this price point, we&rsquo;d like to see a bigger digital readout screen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A USB Type-C display-out on the back is also included, as the Ryzen 7000 CPUs have built in iGPUs. We&rsquo;d rather see at least an HDMI port here, as this serves mainly for diagnostics without a discrete GPU, and HDMI has wider compatibility than USB Type C for this use case.</p>



<p>With very few compromises, the MSI MEG X670E Ace is awash with features. For purely gamers, this may even include some overkill&mdash;especially things such as the six M.2 slots and 10GbE LAN. (Unless your Steam Library is gigantic, then our apologies!) Hybrid content creators/gamers will love the features though, without needing to step up to even more premium offerings such as the &ldquo;Godlike&rdquo; model.</p>



<h2 id="msi-meg-x670e-ace-design">MSI MEG X670E Ace: Design</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI MEG X670E ACE" class="wp-image-1446860" height="778" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2022-11-28-at-1.08.09-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The MSI MEG X670E Ace looks good with or without RGB.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>The MSI MEG X670E Ace is immediately eye-catching with its blacked-out design and gold accents. It&rsquo;s quite the looker, with RGB on&mdash;or off!</p>



<p>This design isn&rsquo;t just here to wow you&mdash;it also serves a functional duty. The M.2 &ldquo;Frozr&rdquo; slot shield has thermal pads helping to keep them cool&mdash;and even the PCIe slots are reinforced. The various heatsinks throughout also look great and have useful utility, too.</p>



<p>Heading down to the lower right, you&rsquo;ll find the PCH area nicely reinforced&mdash;with some nice design patterns and gold accents. You&rsquo;ll also get some RGB light effects on the word &ldquo;ACE&rdquo; and on a triangle in the lower area. The aesthetics are simple, but highly effective on this motherboard.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI MEG X670E ACE" class="wp-image-1446880" height="747" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2022-11-28-at-1.09.10-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>The upper VRM heatsink area is not only beefy, but perfectly joins the MSI &ldquo;Dragon&rdquo; on the I/O shield. It lights up in RGB giving it a tasteful pop of color amid the more serious design elements.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;re happy to see the inclusion of a backplate here for this premium offering. While it may not necessarily do much, it does give the motherboard a high-end tactile feel in the hands and adds a bit of protection. It does help cool down MOSFETS as its primary function, so it&rsquo;s not all just in the looks!</p>



<p>The integrated I/O shield continues the dark look with gold accents, and red colored usb ports. This makes for easier reading when installed, and overall looks clean and functional. The top of the I/O shield also looks great, continuing the design theme with the RGB infused dragon.</p>



<h2 id="msi-meg-x670e-ace-performance-software-and-bios">MSI MEG X670E Ace: Performance, software, and BIOS</h2>



<p>How does the MSI MEG X670E Ace deliver on performance for both gamers and content creators? Like a true &ldquo;Ace,&rdquo; it seems! First, the robust VRM of 22+2+1 will handle the Ryzen 9 7950X with ease. It also adds an eight-layer PCB and beefy cooling components. In fact, you&rsquo;ll be more likely to hit thermal limits on your CPU cooler than on anything motherboard related&mdash;it&rsquo;s more than overkill!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Heatsinks, stacked fin arrays, heat pipes, a metal backplate, and &ldquo;Frozr M.2&rdquo; solutions are abundant everywhere on this motherboard. This helps keep performance optimal&mdash;be it for the CPU, M.2 slots, or with MOSFET cooling. Next-generation hardware is putting out more performance&mdash;and even more heat&mdash;than ever.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Top-speed DDR5 RAM is here and you&rsquo;ll get top speeds out of your drives, as up to three of them can support PCIe Gen 5, and the others PCIe Gen 4. This is some of the fastest performance you&rsquo;ll find, period. If you plan on adding fast PCIe Gen 5 add-in cards alongside your GPU, having these three 16x slots may prove fruitful for you in the long run&mdash;but for users not making use of this, it may be unnecessarily adding to the overall cost. All three 16x slots are linked to the CPU, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The only performance area&mdash;if you can call it that&mdash;that we&rsquo;d like to see beefed up would be in adding USB4 for those who need it. Otherwise, you still get a very fast 20Gb/s USB.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;d like to push performance a bit further, the MSI BIOS is straightforward to use. On this motherboard, you&rsquo;ll get more tweaking options than you&rsquo;ll likely ever use, such as various options for CPU and RAM tinkering. This generation Ryzen 7000 may benefit more from &ldquo;Eco Mode&rdquo; type adjustments to maintain performance for less power draw. The typical &ldquo;overclock to the max&rdquo; type of tinkering we may be used to isn&rsquo;t always the best route.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For those who just want a &ldquo;set it and forget it&rdquo; approach, the MSI BIOS also does that competently&mdash;such as setting the Expo RAM profiles for maximum DDR5 performance out of the box. You can also set to automatically overclock your CPU, with AMD&rsquo;s Precision Boost Overdrive (PBO) along with MSI&rsquo;s help, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since AM5 is a new platform that may encounter some growing pains, we&rsquo;d recommend updating the BIOS as it may lead to more stability improvements than you&rsquo;d typically need to do on a more mature platform. MSI makes that easy in the BIOS, too!</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI MEG X670E ACE" class="wp-image-1446883" height="743" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2022-12-23-at-1.22.19-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>MSI Center BIOS software.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">MSI</p></div>



<p>If you want to keep some of that customization on the software side, we have MSI&rsquo;s Center software available. Much like Asus Armoury Crate, this aims to be an all-in-one solution for various tasks. Setting RGB Mystic Light profiles, different fan curves, and even some hardware monitoring. You can also get driver updates without having to check the MSI website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While motherboard software such as this has been greatly improving, we still recommend the BIOS or third-party software for some functions such as fan control, hardware monitoring, etc.</p>



<h2 id="should-you-buy-the-msi-meg-x670e-ace">Should you buy the MSI MEG X670E Ace?</h2>



<p>Coming in at $699, the MSI MEG X670E Ace is not cheap&mdash;and has other competition from motherboards such as the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1385986/asus-rog-crosshair-x670e-hero-motherboard-review.html">Asus ROG X670E Hero</a>. It falls into a bit of an odd world with its pricing and feature set.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The design is attractive, and functionally integrates well with great cooling solutions on the motherboard itself. The feature set is rich for gamers, but seems to be even more rich for content creators. 10GbE LAN, plenty of I/O, and great audio are all here. We&rsquo;d like to see USB4, however, especially at this level of motherboard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The good news continues with an onslaught of M.2 drive support, but we start to see a pattern develop here: There are many features that may be unnecessary for a pure gamer use case, which doesn&rsquo;t call require the content-creator style additions at $699. With platform costs being higher on average with AMD&rsquo;s AM5, it may make some cheaper motherboards just as attractive for pure gamers&mdash;such as MSI&rsquo;s own X670E Carbon, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1421913/asrock-x670e-taichi-gaming-motherboard-review.html">Asrock X670E Taichi</a>, or the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1384251/asus-rog-strix-x670-e-motherboard-review.html">Asus X670E Strix</a> at under $500.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall, it&rsquo;s a premium motherboard offering from MSI that delivers on its execution and aesthetics. It nicely completes a high-end Ryzen 7000 build for gamers&mdash;and even more so those who are also content creators.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The rise of consumer-focused artificial intelligence applications (like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/788422/how-to-get-started-with-ai-art-dall-e-mini-ai-dungeon-and-more.html">AI art</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1424575/chatgpt-is-the-future-of-ai-chatbots.html">ChatGPT</a>) was the most dynamic trend of 2022. But don&rsquo;t get <em>too</em> excited quite yet &mdash; buying new laptops from AMD and Intel with AI functions built in aren&rsquo;t worth you opening your wallet.</p>



<p>Given the breakneck pace of AI development, though, they may very well be come <em>next</em> year&rsquo;s CES.</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on. Deep within the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1445760/amds-mobile-ryzen-naming-scheme-is-stupidly-complex.html">confusing mishmash</a> of processor architectures that make up <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444850/amd-launches-mobile-ryzen-7000-cpus-prepping-for-an-ai-future.html">AMD&rsquo;s latest mobile Ryzen chips</a> lies XDNA, the new AI hardware architecture that AMD is launching within the Ryzen Mobile 7040 Series as &ldquo;Ryzen AI.&rdquo; (Think of XDNA as the AI version of RDNA, the foundation of AMD&rsquo;s Radeon graphics cores.) Intel has similar plans, though right now it&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1435904/intel-launches-13th-gen-mobile-core-chips-with-endurance-gaming.html">using a discrete Movidius AI card</a> as a placeholder until its <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1076150/intel-confirms-ai-improvements-will-come-in-meteor-lake.html">Meteor Lake chips integrate a &ldquo;real&rdquo; AI core</a>. Qualcomm has offered AI technology as part of its Arm-based Snapdragon chips for years, which power most smartphones but are a niche player in Windows PCs.</p>



<p>Right now, there is only one reason to buy an AI-powered PC: Windows Studio Effects, the collection of webcam technologies built into the Snapdragon-wielding <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1357826/microsoft-surface-pro-9-5g-review-an-arm-tablet-worth-buying.html">Microsoft Surface Pro 9 5G</a>. Windows chief Panos Panay joined AMD CEO Lisa Su onstage to talk up Studio Effects during XDNA&rsquo;s introduction. The technology includes a number of different features &mdash; an integrated background blur, noise filtering to cut out background sounds, Eye Contact, and automatic framing. All use AI in some ways; Eye Contact, for example, uses the webcam to notice where your eyes are looking and then applies AI to make them look as if you&rsquo;re constantly making eye contact with the camera.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD Ryzen AI XDNA" class="wp-image-1448571" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/amd-ryzen-ai-xdna.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">AMD</p></div>



<p>That&rsquo;s interesting, though not ground-breaking. Still, Microsoft has smartly used AI to improve productivity on your local device in ways that make you look more alert and productive. Without it, you simply have to put more effort in: pay attention, make sure you&rsquo;re centered on camera, and conduct meetings from a quiet location.</p>



<p>But AI is still feeling itself out on a number of different fronts. </p>



<p>First, there&rsquo;s the hardware. Remember that PC sound accelerators started out within the CPU, migrated out into a standalone chip/card (RIP, SoundBlaster) and then back into the CPU again. GPUs traced a similar path, but they&rsquo;ve become so valuable that they&rsquo;ll remain discrete components seemingly forever. With AI, no one&rsquo;s quite sure: <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/916785/creating-ai-art-local-pc-stable-diffusion.html">AI art applications like Stable Diffusion</a> were designed for PC GPUs, but they require a substantial amount of video RAM to even function. It&rsquo;s far easier for users to ask <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/820518/midjourneys-ai-art-goes-live-for-everyone.html">services like Midjourney</a> or <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1419066/microsoft-designer-is-almost-a-masterpiece-already.html">Microsoft&rsquo;s stunning Designer app</a> to compute those AI functions in the cloud, even if you have to &ldquo;pay&rdquo; via a subscription or advertising. </p>



<p>There&rsquo;s also the very reasonable question of what AI apps and services we&rsquo;ll see in the years to come. AI art exploded during the last six months to not only include art but <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1424575/chatgpt-is-the-future-of-ai-chatbots.html">AI-powered chatbots like ChatGPT </a>that some think may replace or <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1446692/report-microsoft-is-making-bing-its-next-ai-app.html">supplement search engines like Bing</a>. Companies quietly toiled away on AI server hardware and learning models throughout the past years, and the fruits of those labors are being reaped now. Training massive AI engines can literally take months, but models like ChatGPT can generate text right now that could receive passing grades in high school. What will the next generation hold? We all remember what the early days of the PC were like, with Pentium chips pushing the PC into the mainstream. It very much feels like that time now, even if we can&rsquo;t know for sure what that future will look like.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD Ryzen AI XDNA" class="wp-image-1448572" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/amd-ryzen-ai-xdna-use.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">AMD</p></div>



<p>It&rsquo;s probably fair to say, then, that 2022 was the year that AI began emerging into the public consciousness. This year, 2023, feels like the year it all begins shaking out: what services will be viable, what we&rsquo;ll use, what society will ask for in the future. It seems very likely that software forks of Stable Diffusion and other AI frameworks will be recoded for Ryzen AI and the Movidius hardware, and we&rsquo;ll have a better understanding of how XDNA compares to RDNA in terms of what it can accomplish.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s an exciting future, though it&rsquo;s still the future. AMD told PCWorld that its XDNA architecture was designed around an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) it obtained from its Xilinx acquisition, a technology which allows the hardware to be quickly reconfigured. FPGAs make sense when a technology isn&rsquo;t totally understood, and changes and adjustments need to be made. </p>



<p>Subsequent chip revisions in 2024 and 2025 will likely integrate AI into our computing lives: top-to-bottom integration, more dedicated logic. Who knows? We may use AI to &ldquo;train&rdquo; digital models of ourselves, so those models can start to serve as AI proxies &mdash; scheduling dentist appointments, say, with knowledge of our calendar and our contacts. We could create a video avatar of ourselves as a sort of visual voice mail, if we still used voice mail. </p>



<p>On the other hand, people bet big on the metaverse. The future that a company <em>wants</em> isn&rsquo;t always what it ends up being. </p>



<p>We&rsquo;d doubt that you&rsquo;ll rush out to buy up new AI-powered PC processors. For now, we&rsquo;d recommend you wait. But we&rsquo;re also fairly confident that AI will be a part of your PC&rsquo;s future, whenever that future ends up arriving.</p>
