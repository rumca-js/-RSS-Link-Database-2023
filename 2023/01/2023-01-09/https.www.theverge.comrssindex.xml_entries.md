  <p id="BdF0mx">Google is taking another shot at bringing new features to phones that haven’t gotten OS updates in years. It’s releasing something called the “Extension Software Developer Kit,” which should let developers use features like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/10/22926874/android-13-features-developer-previewlanguage-controls">Android 13’s new photo picker</a> in apps running on some versions of Android 11 and 12. In a blog post announcing the change, the company says the feature lets it “extend the support of certain platform functionality to existing Android versions.”</p>
<p id="tcCYmK">While more access to the photo picker previously exclusive to Android 13 is definitely nice, Google seems to have much bigger plans for the Extension SDK. “This update also sets the stage for expanding Privacy Sandbox testing on Android,” says Scott Westover, a Google...</p>

  <p id="N4SvDq">Valve’s game distribution platform Steam had a record-breaking weekend, exceeding 10 million concurrent in-game players for the first time, while also surpassing 32 million concurrent online users. According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/">SteamDB</a> (a non-Valve affiliated database), Steam racked up 10,082,055 active in-game players and 32,186,301 concurrent online users — folks who were online, but not necessarily playing a game — on Saturday, January 7th, surpassing previous user milestones. </p>
<p id="LLChfd">In fact, Steam has already surpassed the record for concurrent online users in the last 24 hours since SteamDB’s initial announcement on Saturday, with a new <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/753/graphs/">all-time peak of 33,078,963 users</a> being reported by the database website.</p>

  <p id="tpBPrI">Raspberry Pi is launching a new camera module for use with its diminutive DIY computers — <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/new-autofocus-camera-modules/">the Camera Module 3</a>. Its upgraded Sony IMX708 sensor is higher resolution, but perhaps more important is that the new module supports high dynamic range photography and autofocus. Alongside it, Raspberry Pi is also releasing a new camera board for use with M12-mount lenses.</p>
<p id="eeS3HT">Combined, the new features mean the Camera Module 3 should be able to take more detailed photographs (especially in low light), and can focus on objects as little as 5cm away. The autofocus uses a Phase Detection Autofocus (PDAF) system, with Contrast Detection Autofocus used as a backup. In contrast, previous versions of the camera module had fixed-focus lenses, which Raspberry...</p>
