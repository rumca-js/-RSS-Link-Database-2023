However, these efforts veer too far off course from what made <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/golf-story/\">Golf Story</a> as special as it is, creating an experience that oftentimes suffocates under the bloat of too many unwanted fetch quests and unpolished mechanics. A weak story and numerous technical issues also hamper the experience, making Sports Story a disappointment overall.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Sports Story picks up a bit after the events of Golf Story. After proving to be a capable golfer, the unnamed protagonist now finds himself on the cusp of signing a contract and going pro. After going through the motions of checking into your hotel, finding new golf clubs, and acquiring a license, you head off to the countryside for a little practice. Upon reaching your destination, you find the area under the abusive thumb of the bat-wielding Iron Dragons and decide to take on the role of a detective to figure out what's going on and stop this gang from ruining people's lives.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The story abruptly shifts around this early point. No longer are you an aspiring golfer doing his best to solve other people's problems through your golfing skills; instead, you start hopping from one location to the next as a freelance investigator, aiding people in the struggles they're facing and collecting clues related to the ongoing threat of the Iron Dragons. It's not all that compelling a tale to watch unfold, especially with many of the funny and memorable characters from Golf Story either only showing up in a limited capacity or being entirely removed from the plot in favor of focusing on the bland and annoyingly simple-minded protagonist.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sports-story-review-over-par/1900-6418016/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/videos/ps5-exclusive-game-ooze-leaks-gamespot-news/2300-6460344/", "title": "PS5 Exclusive Game \"Ooze\" Leaks | GameSpot News", "date_published": "2023-01-09 22:09:00+00:00", "description": "<img height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1574/15746725/4084655-20230109_playstation5exclusivegameleak_newsv2.jpg\" width=\"480\" /> A new PlayStation 5 exclusive game leaks, Xbox might have a showcase in January, and get Dead Space 2 for free.", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-where-to-get-pebbles/1100-6510434/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Disney Dreamlight Valley: Where To Get Pebbles", "date_published": "2023-01-09 21:59:00+00:00", "description": "<p>There is certainly no shortage of things to craft in <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/disney-dreamlight-valley/\">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a>, and each item, path, or fence you make requires at least one of the many resources found throughout the game's various biomes. One such resource is pebbles, which are needed quite often--especially if you're crafting paths around your valley.

You can definitely speed things up substantially, however, by bringing along a friend who specializes in digging so that you'll earn extra materials as you go. Additionally, you can always use a <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-all-miracle-potion-recipes/1100-6510432/\">Miracle Shovel Varnish</a>--provided you've gathered the materials to craft one--as it will improve how many resources you get while digging.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-where-to-get-pebbles/1100-6510434/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-ps5-deals-available-right-now-save-on-games-accessories-and-more/2900-4570/", "title": "The Best PS5 Deals Available Right Now: Save On Games, Accessories, And More", "date_published": "2023-01-09 21:51:00+00:00", "description": "<p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1702/17023653/4084492-spidermanmiles%282%29.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>With January set to be a relatively quiet month for new game releases, it's a good time to catch up on games you didn't pick up at launch.

On January 7, Steam smashed not only its record for concurrent online users with 32 million, but also its record for concurrent in-game players, with 10 million. Judging by the usual Steam charts, that's a lot of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.</p><div><blockquote align=\"center\" class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Steam has reached 10 million concurrent in-game players for the first time, as well as 32 million concurrently online users today.<a href=\"https://t.co/D6WDHbz0B4\">https://t.co/D6WDHbz0B4</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/rbRabSCLye\">pic.twitter.com/rbRabSCLye</a></p>  \u2014 SteamDB (@SteamDB) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SteamDB/status/1611821827948531714?ref_src=twsrc^tfw\">January 7, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir=\"ltr\">Over at <a href=\"https://steamdb.info/app/753/graphs/\">SteamDB</a>, you can take a look at the lifetime concurrent users on Steam, and you can see that it's increased quite a bit in the past few years. In fact, Steam has been breaking its concurrent players record every few days or so for the past month, as the slope of the curve has been quite steep. The number of in-game players has remained slightly more consistent over the same period since 2018, with various peaks and valleys depending on user trends. The highest peak in recent data was roughly 33 million online users and 10.2 million in-game.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Currently, the most popular games on Steam are CS:GO, Dota 2, Lost Ark, PUBG: Battlegrounds, and Rust, in that order. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (which includes Warzone 2.0), Apex Legends, GTA V, FIFA 23, and Team Fortress 2 round out the top 10. In terms of release date, Modern Warfare 2 is the youngest game on the list, and TF2 is by far the oldest. Despite Counter-Strike's dominance, PUBG still has the highest peak player count ever recorded by SteamDB, at more than 3.2 million users--CS:GO's is only 1.3 million. Of course, the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-deck-review-redefinition/1100-6500986/\">Steam Deck</a> is a key part of Valve's continued dominance, and we should only expect the device to become more popular in the coming months.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-reaches-huge-new-all-time-player-records/1100-6510426/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nicolas-cage-doesnt-want-a-star-wars-role-prefers-star-trek/1100-6510425/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Nicolas Cage Doesn't Want A Star Wars Role, Prefers Star Trek", "date_published": "2023-01-09 19:01:00+00:00", "description": "<p>Oscar-winning actor Nicolas Cage has said he has no interest in appearing in a Star Wars project, as his loyalties lie with Star Trek instead.

There's no story to adapt the same way that you could adapt a novel or narrative video game.
