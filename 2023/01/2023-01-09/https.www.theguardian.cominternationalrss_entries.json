Much good may it do them, given a visit to Manchester City is up next, but a banana skin was avoided and their third-tier opponents can claim to have given them a good contest for the majority.

While he shuffled the pack there were still starts for Saka, Nketiah and Gabriel Martinelli, the front three nailed on to face Spurs on Sunday.

Now, the 1964 Broadway staging has inspired The Motive and the Cue, a new play by Jack Thorne</p><p>In 1964 Richard Burton played Hamlet on Broadway in a modern-dress production directed by John Gielgud. By commercial standards, it was a roaring success: it ran for <a href=\"https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/hamlet-3062\">17 weeks</a>, breaking a record previously <a href=\"https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/hamlet-11205\">held by Gielgud himself</a>, and was packed out every night. But, for many of those involved, it was not a happy experience. And that is the subject of a new play by Jack Thorne, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/nov/22/mark-gatiss-johnny-flynn-sam-mendes-play-about-hamlet-national-theatre-the-motive-and-the-cue\">The Motive and the Cue</a>, which starts previewing at the National Theatre in April, directed by Sam Mendes with Johnny Flynn as Burton, Mark Gatiss as Gielgud and Tuppence Middleton as Elizabeth Taylor, who had married Burton during the production\u2019s Toronto tryout and whose offstage presence was a source of permanent distraction.</p><p>There are endless testimonies as to the tensions caused by the production. Melvyn Bragg in Rich, his Burton biography, reveals how the actor felt so unprepared that before the first performance he summoned his mentor and surrogate father, Philip Burton, to Toronto to privately take him through the text. Gielgud later lamented: \u201cThe American cast did not understand very much of what I was trying to do. All they wanted was motivation.\u201d Best of all is Letters from an Actor by William Redfield, the production\u2019s Guildenstern, in which, while sympathetic to Burton and Gielgud, he says: \u201cBetween the two men there is an artistic disagreement, an aesthetic split. It is a fundamental difference of both belief and technique.\u201d All of which suggests Thorne has plenty to get his teeth into.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jan/09/hamlet-richard-burton-john-gielgud-the-motive-and-the-cue-jack-thorne\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2023/jan/09/oxford-united-v-arsenal-fa-cup-third-round-live-score-updates", "title": "Oxford United v Arsenal: FA Cup third round \u2013 live", "date_published": "2023-01-09 19:28:04+00:00", "description": "<ul><li>FA Cup third round updates from the 8pm GMT kick-off</li><li>Get in touch: contact Will <a href=\"mailto:will.unwin.casual@theguardian.com\">by email</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Will_Unwin\">on Twitter</a></li></ul><p>\u201cBurgers and Fries?

This ability usually involves nerve, too: the confidence to pick something up and examine it from all sides, and a skin thick enough not to be concerned by stallholders, supermarket managers or signs saying \u201cDo not touch\u201d. I don\u2019t have any of the above, so I\u2019m often disappointed by melons and pumpkins. I told my friend Alice this recently and she revealed her technique while we were shopping at Monteverde market. She often asks stallholders to cut melons, pumpkins or squashes open, promising that she will buy even if it\u2019s furry or flavourless, but in the knowledge it\u2019s a dud. And, of course, the cutter is then in a corner.</p><p>This, too, requires nerves and skin as thick as the knobbly, grey-green pumpkin I stood holding in a shop the other day.

Nor was it particularly brilliant; despite being a <em>zucca marina di Chioggia</em>, which are usually reliable things, with dense, orange flesh that is first and foremost savoury, with a sweetness that comes after. If only I\u2019d had more nerve, or gone to another shop. Other pumpkin varieties to look out for are squat, dark-green kabocha, which has dry, starchy flesh with a butter and chestnut flavour and just a touch of sweetness; pale green-blue crown prince, which looks like someone has sat on it, and has dense flesh that reminds one of swede and sweet potato; red, green and white-striped turban squash, which indeed does look like a pumpkin wearing a turban, and has gentle flesh like butternut squash.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/09/pumpkin-beans-greens-and-cheese-stew-recipe-rachel-roddy\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/09/prince-harry-palace-royalist-media-britain-monarchy", "title": "Are you siding with Harry or the palace?

Boy, how things have changed.\u201d</p><p>Back in the 00s, Sony\u2019s God of War games were notable for several reasons \u2013 their jaw-dropping scale, the bite and immediacy of their combat, the sheer spectacle of their fantasy violence \u2013 but they were not exactly famed for their characters. Kratos, the protagonist, was an angry lump of muscle whose narrative arc mostly involved killing bigger and bigger things and getting more and more furious. So when Kratos and God of War returned in 2018 after a long hiatus, it was a surprise to find that not only had he left the realm of Greek mythology for Scandinavia, but he was now a widower, accompanied by a young son with whom he struggled to connect.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jan/09/he-gives-us-every-bit-of-himself-how-god-of-wars-actors-hold-the-whole-game-together\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/09/israel-security-minister-bans-palestinian-flag-flying-in-public", "title": "Israel security minister bans Palestinian flag-flying in public", "date_published": "2023-01-09 09:49:36+00:00", "description": "<p>Itamar Ben-Gvir\u2019s order follows series of punitive steps against Palestinians since Israel\u2019s hardline government took office</p><p>Israel\u2019s national security minister has ordered police to ban Palestinian flags from public places in the latest crackdown by the country\u2019s new hardline government.</p><p>Itamar Ben-Gvir\u2019s order follows a series of other punitive steps against the Palestinians since taking office late last month.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/09/israel-security-minister-bans-palestinian-flag-flying-in-public\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/jan/09/tanzania-press-freedom-violations-president-suluhu", "title": "Hopes rise for press freedom in Tanzania as number of censured journalists falls", "date_published": "2023-01-09 09:35:24+00:00", "description": "<p>Media council reports progress under progressive stance of President Suluhu following years of repression by former regime</p><p>The number of journalists being censured for their work in Tanzania has fallen slightly, raising hopes that press freedom is improving in the country.</p><p>Last year, 17 \u201cpress violations\u201d, which include threats, arrests, denial of access to information and equipment seizures, were reported in the east African nation, the Media Council of Tanzania told the Guardian.
