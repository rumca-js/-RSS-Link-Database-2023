If you go to their site and click\n\"\n\n<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/donate/organizations\">start\ngiving</a>\" they list \n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/historical-notes-on-charitable-funds\">charitable funds</a>,\nincluding GiveWell's \n\n<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/all-grants\">All Grants\nFund</a> and the \n\n<a href=\"https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/ea-community\">EA Infra\nFund</a>, both of which our family donated to \n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/our-2022-giving\">in 2022</a>.  Showing funds first reflects\n\n\n<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/wHyvkwpwCA4nm46rp/why-giving-what-we-can-recommends-using-expert-led\">their\nview</a> (and mine!) that most people should donate via funds: a\ngrantmaker with time and resources to determine where money is most\nneeded can generally do a better job allocating funds than an\nindividual.\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nOne of the big downsides of donating via a fund, however, is that you\nhave to trust its grantmakers are allocating your money in line\nwith what you would want.  Perhaps they have different values\nor ways of thinking about uncertainty, risk, and evidence.\nOr perhaps they're just not very good at their job.  One of GWWC's\nroles is <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pp2jmWHyDK9sfC4Rh/evaluating-the-evaluators-gwwc-s-research-direction\">evaluating\nthese funds</a>, helping people figure out who to trust, but if you're\nmore skeptical GWWC also recommends individual charities.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n\n\nThey maintain a list of <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/trusted-evaluators\">charity\nevaluators they trust</a>, and if one of those evaluators recommends a\ncharity then GWWC will list it prominently on their site and badge it\nas \"top rated\".  You can see these on GWWC's <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/donate/organizations\">donating page</a>\nif you scroll down past the funds.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThere was recently some <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ffmbLCzJctLac3rDu/strongminds-should-not-be-a-top-rated-charity-yet\">discussion\non the EA Forum</a> around one of these evaluators, <a href=\"https://founderspledge.com/\">Founders Pledge</a>, and one\nof their recommended charities, <a href=\"https://strongminds.org/\">StrongMinds</a>.  In March 2019,\nFounders Pledge performed a detailed investigation of StrongMinds, decided that their work\ntreating depression in low-income countries was highly cost-effective,\nand wrote up a public evaluation explaining this decision (<a href=\"https://founderspledge.com/stories/mental-health-report-summary\">summary</a>,\n<a href=\"https://founderspledge.com/research/fp-mental-health\">details</a>). GWWC then listed StrongMinds as a top-rated\ncharity. All makes sense.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nWhile Founders Pledge has continued to follow StrongMinds' work and\nstands by their recommendation, they haven't <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ffmbLCzJctLac3rDu/strongminds-should-not-be-a-top-rated-charity-yet?commentId=asCgBvZbEEZvMqPxD\">had the resources</a> to\nupdate their public review. Since Founders Pledge continues to\nrecommend StrongMinds, GWWC continues to consider it a top-rated\ncharity.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThis is not a great situation: if you want to be giving to individual\ncharities because you don't trust grantmakers deciding privately what\nmost needs funding, you don't want to be taking Founders Pledge's word\nthat StrongMinds is still a highly cost-effective opportunity. How has\ntheir funding outlook changed over the last nearly four years? Have\nthere been more recent studies on their work or on this kind of\nintervention?\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nA case with even less public information is <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/charities/suvita\">Suvita</a>. GWWC\n<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/charities/suvita#why-is-suvita-one-of-our-toprated-charities\">says</a>\nthey\nrecommend Suvita because Founders Pledge's <a href=\"https://founderspledge.com/funds/global-health-and-development\">Global Health and\nDevelopment Fund</a> made a grant there in July 2022. GWWC links to that\nfund's <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/15R9Kvd0eW5tFz5aandtmB4ONeR26VAUkYdIncvd6Yvw/edit\">Q2\n2022 grants writeup</a> which has a single paragraph on Suvita.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI think what Founders Pledge is doing here is fine; this is a\nreasonable level of transparency for a fund making a $50k grant. On\nthe other hand, for a charity that GWWC is promoting directly to\ndonors it's very little to back up a designation of \"top rated\".\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n(After sharing a draft of this post with Founders Pledge they linked\nme to a <a href=\"https://founderspledge.com/stories/suvita\">more\ndetailed writeup on Suvita</a>, but it isn't currently linked from the\nrest of their site or from GWWC.)\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nOn the EA Forum I <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ffmbLCzJctLac3rDu/strongminds-should-not-be-a-top-rated-charity-yet?commentId=mQzmAsiYNKkrR6rdM\">proposed</a> that one of GWWC's requirements for\nendorsing recommendations from their trusted evaluators be that\nthey're supported by current public evaluations. In the case of\nStrongMinds, once Founders Pledge's public evaluation became stale\nGWWC could have removed the \"top rated\" badge. GWWC's <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ffmbLCzJctLac3rDu/strongminds-should-not-be-a-top-rated-charity-yet?commentId=mmeKBXkmP7guwRGNZ\">response</a> was\nthat they thought their current policy was correct because \"our goal\nis primarily to provide guidance on what are the best places to give\nto according to a variety of worldviews, rather than what are the best\nexplainable/publicly documented places to give.\"\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIn this case, I don't think this should be their goal. The biggest\nadvantage I see to GWWC pointing people to specific charities, not\njust funds, is that this simpler approach supports people in directing\ntheir money effectively even if they don't trust the private decisions\nof evaluators. This doesn't work without recommendations being backed\nby reasonably detailed public current evaluations.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nNote that this doesn't require that most donors read the evaluations:\nlower-trust donors still (rightly!) understand that their chances of\nfunding work that's pretty different from what they thought they were\nfunding are much lower if an evaluator has written up a public case.\nOn the other hand, there are several reasons why a donor willing to\ntake an evaluator's word for how effective a charity is might still\nprefer to donate to an individual charity instead of a fund:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p>Taxes. Donations to, for example, StrongMinds are\ntax-advantaged in <a href=\"https://strongminds.org/international-donors/\">22\ncountries</a> while donations via the EA Funds platform are only\ntax-advantaged <a href=\"https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/help/4Cwks49FpCA2WuWWySC6ac\">in 3</a>. If the fund is planning on granting to charity X\nthis year, then you donating to X has similar effects to donating to\nthe fund.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>Preference adjustments. Perhaps you agree with a fund in general, but\nyou think they value averting deaths too highly relative to improving\nalready existing lives. By donating to one of the charities they\ntypically fund that focuses on the latter you might shift the\ndistribution of funds in that direction. Or maybe not; your donation\nalso has the effect of decreasing how much additional funding the\ncharity needs, and the fund might allocate more elsewhere.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>Ops skepticism. When you donate through a fund, in addition to\ntrusting the grantmakers to make good decisions you're also trusting\nthe fund's operations staff to handle the money properly and that your\nmoney won't be caught up in <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bjZymDm7yfPDdzcrP/update-on-gwwc-donation-platform?commentId=WWPjkE4qxJn4CxDux\">unrelated legal trouble</a>. Donating directly\nto a charity avoids these risks.\n\n</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nThese are real concerns, but they're the kind of concerns\nsophisticated and committed donors are likely to have. These are the\nkind of people who are much less likely to put a lot of weight on a\n\"top rated\" badge, or to be on the fence about whether to\ndonate. Supporting donors in these kinds of situations is good, but\nthat mostly just requires listing the charities, not marking them as\n\"top rated\". Overall, I still think limiting the \"top rated\" badge and\npromotion to charities that have current public evaluations is the\nright choice for GWWC.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<br />\n\n<i>Disclosure: <a href=\"https://juliawise.net/\">my wife</a> used to be President of GWWC, but I haven't run\nthis post by her and I don't know what she thinks of this proposal.
